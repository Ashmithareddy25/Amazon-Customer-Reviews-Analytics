B00D0SEGMC|1.0|When I downloaded this I hoped that it would replace the beloved &#34;navigation&#34; app that was from Google Maps. Unfortunately this app does not list the name of the street you are supposed to turn on; opting instead to simply tell you what street you are currently on and the distance until your next turn. In the country this could work just fine, but in cities where there are many streets this constantly confuses the user. It was also frustrating that it did not recognize my home address as a real address. Save your money and pray that Google restores the separate &#34;navigation&#34; app.

B00BEIYLAW|4.0|This film is not your typical movie. It's not meant to be a motion picture to \\"entertain\\" the audience and give that cinematic experience. It's not quite a classical biography or documentary either, as there is no narration or third party interviews. The movie covers Jobs from college to first iPod announcement in 2001, and during this time only parts of his life that is relevant to his endeavor to create (Atari game, Apple I board, Apple II, LISA, first Macintosh). The movie skipped entire stint at NeXT and jumped to his return to Apple and begin instill his philosophy for new Mac and into consumer devices.<br /><br />For general audience, the film will come across bunch of short films concatenated. Each transition (screen black out) may be few months or few years later. For those not familiar with the timeline of events, it may be tough to following as there are no mention of which year after each scene jump. This have bother some people as evident in the reviews from general public.<br /><br />Personally, I enjoyed the viewing. This is probably because 1) I get to be nostalgic and relive the early personal computers from the first Apple II / TRS-80 rivalry, to the intro of Mac challenging IBM PC, and onward. Second is because I am an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley and can relate to everything Jobs have gone through - from garage start-up to first venture funding to first trade show to company growing big to turmoils, investor demands, and board battles.<br /><br />In addition to the above two reasons, I think this movie will also resonate with audience that are:<br /><br />1. Genuinely admire/curious Steve Jobs (or really in awe of the Apple products under him)<br />2. Very interested in how Apple came about<br />3. Want insights on going from \\"garage start-ups\\" to big time in the early days of tech<br /><br />I don't know Steve Jobs so I am neutral on Aston Kutcher's portrayl of him. But those that have interacted with him might have strong feelings one way or the other. With that said, I can see Aston Kutcher took the acting role seriously. In general, this kind of \\"biopic\\" film it is seldom completely accurate. It's more for audience to get the gist of it, so take it for what it is.<br /><br />In summary, it's not a movie to entertain but rather to give some insights. If you see the movie with the right interest or expectation (and you don't know about Jobs personally), it could be worth your time.<br /><br />If you like this type of films for the sake of getting some insights and involving Steve Jobs, the movie [[ASIN:B0009NSCS0 Pirates of Silicon Valley]] maybe of interest to you.

B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Yes, this is a big movie with lots of explosions & fights, but the best part is the way the characters interact with one another. Funny, sarcastic, tongue in cheek. As I mentioned in the header, you don't have to be wrapped up in Marvel history to get this film. There is a story, individual characters, action, suspense, and lots of laughs. Be sure to wait until the end of the credits for one more fun scene.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love the story of the brilliant, compassionate and assertive postmistress Dorcas and her sensitive and beautiful protege, Laura. This time period in English history is often ignored but the clash of burgeoning town prosperity and stilted country charm couldn't provide a more fitting juxtaposition of past and future.<br /><br />Quirky and lovable characters abound with romance, struggle and class divisions are wrapped around and throughout the story lines. And of course, the English countryside is the real star of the show!

B00AZMFK3K|2.0|J. J. Abrams completely rewrote Captain J. T. Kirk. This character is stupid, disregard's orders, is a drunk, over sexed, coward who creates the problem rather than solving it. The original was none of these things, he was a hero to many youth who watched the very first episodes. Abrams I don't know where you came up with this character but, you surely didn't watch the original episodes! I'm not impressed by the least with this piece of garbage!<br />If Kirk would have obeyed orders, launched the torpedo's and killed Kahn, instead of aligning himself with Kahn, there wouldn't even be a story. This story was awful and I had a hard time getting thru it. If Gene were alive he'd punch you in the mouth! Enough said; rent don't buy this garbage!

B00EL8JCGU|5.0|I enjoy a good zombie story as much as anybody but I have learned that most movies fall short of the average book in the telling of it. My husband and I both gave this movie a 5-star based on our overall enjoyment level. It's packed with action the whole way through and the characters were played well by the actors (which is so nice for a change from the typical B-movie!). A big plus for me also is that I didn't have to suffer through some cheesy sex scene. The zombies were as believable as any and , for me, scarier than most. The CG is a little noticeable but does't detract from the quality of the movie and the fun we had watching it.

140006922X|3.0|I find much of the author's historical points surrounding the time of Jesus to be very informative.  Much of the dismissal of Jesus's divinity is based, I think, on simply loss of faith.  Since I choose to believe in the divinity of Jesus, that is a result of my faith.  An ironic point is that Reza at one time considered himself to be a Christian, and since Christianity is once saved always saved,  he will be in Heaven someday with all those other Christians that he now thinks are wrong.  We will all have a good time then.

B00CX7OX6U|3.0|Director Terrence Malick is most certainly an acquired taste, but one I acquired early with \\"Badlands\\" (1973) and last saw in the remarkable \\"The Tree of Life\\" (2011).  It's pretty rare that he follows up so quickly given his record (10 films total).  Maybe that is the problem with this film.  And make no mistake, it's a problem.  \\"To The Wonder\\" certainly isn't a terrible movie.  Mallick's use of the outdoor landscape resonates throughout the film.  Set in Oklahoma, he edits quickly between everyday scenes.  A setting sun, a flower, an insect.  The film is sparse of dialog.<br /><br />Neil (Ben Afflick) has fewer lines than you can count on your fingers and toes.  He has a romantic affair in Paris with young Marina (Olga Kurylenko, \\"Oblivion\\").  She has young daughter, having been abandon by her husband.  Neil agrees reluctantly to bring her to America where they are to be married and she can get her Green Card.  Neil works for the state or federal EPA and is seen taking soil and water samples throughout the film.  Why?  Dunno.<br /><br />As he becomes more distant emotionally, Marina and daughter will return to France, but eventually return.  In the meantime, Neil rekindles a relationship with Jane (Rachel McAdams, \\"Midnight In Paris\\").  When she starts a discussion about marriage, Neil retreats again.  Hey, the guy doesn't want to get married!<br /><br />While all this is going on, Father Quintana (Javier Bardem, \\"Skyfall\\") is having his own mental issues.  Is he doing all he can do for humanity?  Should he even be a priest?  He eventually becomes a confidant to Marina, when she returns.  Marina and Neil reunite, but their bickering and emotional struggles increase to the point of being violent.  Is anything resolved?  Love isn't always perfect.  As I look back at Malick's films, this one is certainly his least impressive but perhaps most personal.<br /><br />In spite of my reservations about the film, there is nothing not to like about the Blu ray transfer.  Shot using 35mm and 65mm cameras, it all comes across beautifully in the 1080p picture and with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The grey and brown starkness of rural Oklahoma comes across with excellent color and hue.  The contrast is spot on and the detail is excellent.  Malick's films always have great soundtracks and this one is no different.  Using DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  There are numerous outdoor shots with staging in Paris and Oklahoma and the range from street noise to whistling wind come through the speakers loud and clear.  I'm not sure why, but I had to raise the volume level a couple notches over my usual setting.  Subtitles come in Spanish and English SDH.

B00A2H9OZS|4.0|Theatrical review. There may be spoilers.<br /><br />Eight years after escaped criminal Richard Riddick endured the latest of his \\"Chronicled\\" adventures, producer and star Vin Diesel along with director and co-writer David Twohy bring him back to life in this less ambitious film. In fact, the filmmakers make a mostly successful stab at the feel of the original movie in the franchise, \\"Pitch Black\\" (2000).<br /><br />Here Riddick (Diesel) is double crossed after years of playing royalty on some distant planet. By his own admission, he had gotten soft. He is unceremoniously dumped on a scorched planet devoid of humans but with plenty of local carnivores. With years of a life of luxury and debauchery he had lost his edge.  Riddick is quickly forced to get it back as his broken body must now deal with the large hyena-like creatures and the nasty water-serpents, both of which are looking for a meal.<br /><br />Riddick stumbles upon an abandon research facility and sends out a distress signal. Once he has been identified, a couple ships of mercs (mercenaries) set down after him. One for the reward (doubled if head brought back) and one out for revenge. A reference that goes back to \\"Pitch Black.\\" The 2 assembled crews at first are competitors but eventually must work together, not only to kill or capture Riddick but to deal with the local fauna.<br /><br />The all-male crews, but for lesbian (or not) Dahl (Katee Sackhoff), are your standard ruffian himbos for the most part. The most diabolical is led by Santana (Jordi Molla). The other is led by the father (Matt Nable) of the Johns character from \\"Pitch Black.\\" He wants answers as to what happen to his son. For most of the film, Riddick is in his full Rambo mode with elaborate traps, many of which are cool if not realistic. The sets here are pretty good, but I don't see any Oscars for technical designs.<br /><br />I did like the creature features, especially in the final act as Riddick pulls out all the stops to escape. Is this movie an improvement over \\"The Chronicles of Riddick?\\" Yes, the tension and sparseness of a good \\"B\\" movie are there. Does it equal the terror and horror of \\"Pitch Black?\\" Not quite. Will there be more Riddick adventures? That depends on how well this film does. For me, yeah I like the character.Is this movie an improvement over \\"The Chronicles of Riddick?\\" Yes, the tension and sparseness of a good \\"B\\" movie are there.

B00124FREW|5.0|This is The Cure's most physical, sensual album. If [[ASIN:B003LXXEFG Disintegration]] sounds \\"classical\\" -- pristine, mannered, elegant, with tubercular pining over \\"Pictures Of You\\" -- then Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me is \\"decadent.\\" One song on it is actually an adaptation of a prose piece by [[ASIN:0879234628 Baudelaire]]. The music has a feverish and unhealthy sound; if the French [[ASIN:0375757708 poets]] had made a rock album, it would have sounded like this. The music is heavy, sticky, and chaotic, and Robert Smith matches it with bizarre lyrics, emphasizing the weirdest aspects of his vocal style.<br /><br />\\"Just Like Heaven\\" was the most successful single (and actually sounds uncharacteristically restrained for this album), but for my money, the real show-stopper here is \\"Why Can't I Be You?\\" This has to be the most brilliantly deranged music ever seriously presented as a pop single. It basically takes a light-funk rhythm and a horn section, makes them play at a manic, break-neck pace (this is probably the most energetic song in The Cure's entire catalogue), and has Smith wail such an over-the-top profession of love that it actually becomes kind of menacing. Lines such as \\"Everything you do is irresistible / everything you do is simply kissable\\" start to sound like accusations, leading into his unhinged scream, \\"why can't I be you?\\" When he gets to \\"everything you do is simply dreamy,\\" he slurs the words so much that it sounds like incoherent raving. And then the horns rock the hell out of the chorus.<br /><br />But don't let the singles overshadow the rest of the album. The very first song, \\"The Kiss,\\" is a logical development from earlier bad-trip Cure songs like \\"[[ASIN:B000GGSM7G Shake Dog Shake]],\\" but here they finally find the right sound -- a delirious, dizzying swirl of hypnotic acid guitars and Simon Gallup's overbearingly loud, primitive bass grind. The song plays as an instrumental for longer than you would expect, before the tension finally explodes with Smith's violent wail. There is not a lot of subtlety here: he bluntly and rather nastily equates lust with poison, thus stating the theme for the entire album. But, in this case, confidence sells the directness of the attack. Never before, or since, had The Cure sounded so dangerous.<br /><br />There is a tendency, not unwarranted, to typecast Smith as a sad sack who writes nursery-rhyme love songs, but this album proves that, once, he was a very strong writer. The Baudelaire cover \\"How Beautiful You Are\\" could have failed in any number of ways, but instead, it is actually better than the source material. It is psychologically deeper: in Baudelaire, the poor folk are simply admiring the elegance of the cafe where the narrator is sitting with his lover, whereas Smith makes them admire the woman specifically. Thus, instead of simply being thoughtless, the woman's reply becomes deeply and ironically cruel. Also, Baudelaire's narrator says, \\"you want to know why I hate you today,\\" whereas Smith drops the \\"today\\" and turns a rich boy's petulant sulk into a life-changing experience.<br /><br />When Smith's voice isn't dominating the songs, the music picks up the slack with the oddest and most unconventional sounds to be found on any Cure album. Several songs are long near-instrumental mood pieces with understated vocals, like \\"The Snakepit,\\" a sexy and hypnotic groove with a killer bass riff, or \\"Icing Sugar,\\" where galloping drums are contrasted with spaced-out, dreamy synths and horns, or the vast chime-guitar expanse in \\"One More Time,\\" which calls to mind some sort of vast underground lake. These songs sit comfortably next to anthemic, bass-heavy arena rock (\\"Torture\\"), claustrophobic insomniac psychedelia (\\"If Only Tonight We Could Sleep\\"), and demented mariachi or swing (\\"Hey You!\\" and \\"Hot Hot Hot!\\"). There are some sweet love songs also, like \\"Catch,\\" which sounds weirder and weirder the more you think about it -- apparently he was in love with a girl whospent all her time staring and falling down.<br /><br />The band's confidence and skill on this album are thrilling. Disintegration is still probably my favourite Cure album, but this one might have stronger, wilder, and more original music. Not every song would have worked as a single, but there are no bad songs, and every song contributes something to the album as a whole. \\"The Kiss,\\" for example, is basically just a really long intro, but it's also one of the best Cure songs ever. At the same time, the album still feels unified, and most of the songs use the same basic psychedelic guitar sound, they just explore all of its facets. If you only know the hits, stop and see what you've been missing.

0812550706|5.0|Enders Game is one of the best action packed, futuristic books out there. This fantastic book shows the life of a young boy on his journey to save humanity. The book incorporates many human emotions such as fear, sadness, happiness, and much more. Orson Scott Card has a knack for expertly show the feelings and emotions a young ten year old has. Many times throughout the book, Ender cries, which is just what you would expect from a ten year old. All the characters in this book are very realistic, and complex in their own way. Along with great characters, Card is able to put a very clear picture of what is going on and what things look like. One of my favorite scenes in the book is the battle room, it made me wish my school had one.<br /><br />Over all this is a fantastic book for science fiction lovers. Not only will you not be able to put the book down, but you will want to read it over and over again.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|The quality of this Blu-ray set is just fantastic. The shows never looked better, in fact they almost look new. Thank goodness they captured this on film so we could have a marvelous transfer to 1080p high definition. You will not be disappointed!

B00CL151G4|5.0|I've been a fan of Sherlock Holmes from books to movies since I was a kid. The books may be what drew some fans in but for me it was growing up with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce and Holmes and Watson, solving crimes by using brains instead of brawn. The recent films starring Robert Downey Jr. are a favorite now as is SHERLOCK on BBC starring Benedict Cumberbatch. Add to that a new updated version of Holmes in the CBS series ELEMENTARY, the first season of which was just released on DVD.<br /><br />Johnny Lee Miller stars as the famous sleuth in current times New York. Having recently moved from England his wealthy father has set out to help him by hiring a full time sobriety partner to aid Holmes with his drug addiction problem (fans of the books will recall Holmes dabbled in cocaine use). It seems that a problematic case led to Holmes downfall but he insists he's cured and not in need of help. His sobriety partner, Dr. Joan Watson (Lucy Liu), isn't interested in his opinion since she was hired by his father.<br /><br />Watson brings along baggage of her own. Her career as a surgeon was cut short by problems she had that led to a mistake. It doesn't take long for Holmes to ferret this out. Knowing that an attempt to dismiss her would be futile he instead takes her along with him whenever the New York police department calls on him to assist in a case.<br /><br />When in London Holmes made a friend of New York detective Capt. Toby Grayson (Aidan Quinn). Realizing what a help he could be in certain cases, Grayson calls on Holmes when the unusual case pops up. Fortunately for the series that happens at least once a week.<br /><br />The cases the duo work on range from wealthy Wall Street denizens to mercy killings in hospitals to plane crash victims. Each time while the rest of the New York police department thinks there is no foul play involved Holmes proves them wrong. As the series plays out we also come find out about why Holmes began using drugs and who pushed him in that direction. It was his infamous arch enemy, Moriarty.<br /><br />What makes this series work is the interplay between the two lead characters. Miller's take on Holmes is a quick thinker who sees the world completely different from everyone else. Nearly everything within eye sight is a clue and the fact that others can't recognize this is something that often infuriates him.<br /><br />Watson on the other hand is more interested in keeping Holmes sober, the job she was hired for. Throughout season one the opportunity for him to fall off the wagon comes on rare occasions and eventually even Watson realizes that he part in helping him is better served as a companion when it comes to his cases. Watson becomes someone to bounce ideas off of and eventually someone that Holmes decides would be better served as an apprentice of sorts. It's a choice that Watson eventually faces before the season ends.<br /><br />Placed in the hands of lesser actors this series would fall flat on its face. But both Miller and Liu bring something fresh to an age old story that works incredibly well. Miller's frenetic movements and habits as Holmes give him an edge that replaces the physical aspects of most detectives seen on TV these days. Liu's interest in helping Holmes through his problems while sorting out her own demons is played without bringing into the role a romance that would seem out of place with these two. While they have a respect for each other and what they can both do turning this into MOONLIGHTING or CASTLE would ruin it. It's better that they play off of one another than fall in love.<br /><br />The series has been renewed for a second season and thank goodness for that. It makes watching TV worthwhile when it's on. Until that season starts, and for those who made the mistake of missing it, the first season on DVD is one worth adding to your collection. While being a Sherlock Holmes fan helps your enjoyment of the series isn't dependant on that. Instead just sit back and try to solve each case with Watson before the end of each show.ck and try to solve each case with Watson before the end of each show.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|fun<br />easy tasking good computer enemy to play. against. and nice board. layout with pieces that go together like they should on a nice playing field
B00CX7TOOG|3.0|It's always nice to see an actor playing a part that suits their age rather than attempt something they are far too old for. I recently found it difficult to accept Sharon Stone playing an investigative reporter in BORDER RUN because the role was definitely something an actress in her late 20s or early 30s should have been playing. So when I heard that Robert DeNiro was going to be playing a vet of the Bosnian war in KILLING SEASON I was wondering how it would play out. Fortunately it comes off pretty well.<br /><br />DeNiro plays Benjamin Ford, an ex-military man who now resides in a cabin in the woods. While we aren't quite sure why he chooses to live out away from people we know there is a reason. Called by his son to attend his grandson's baptism, Ford turns down the offer choosing instead to remain secluded at home.<br /><br />At the same time we're introduced to Emil Kovac (John Travolta), a Serb who is intent on tracking down Ford. As the movie opened we witnessed a group of Serbian soldiers being executed by U.S. military personnel. It's safe to assume Ford was in this group. But why, if they were executed, would Kovac be seeking him out? Revenge for himself? For family? Only time will tell.<br /><br />As the film progresses we see Ford having problems with an old war wound, running out of aspirin and heading for town to buy some. Along the way he runs into a hiker walking along the road about the same time his jeep conks out on him. The hiker is, of course, Kovac. He helps Ford get the jeep started again and after heading the other direction in the rain, Ford turns around and offers him a place to stay for the night at his cabin.<br /><br />The two sit down to dinner and drinks, Kovac having brought along a bottle of Jagermeister. As the liquor loosens their tongues the two share their thoughts of battles past and of their own personal histories. While Kovac pretends to know only what he's read about war Ford lets him know in no uncertain terms that there is much horror to be found there, that it isn't the glorious warrior way so many depict it as. When all is said and done they turn in with plans to hunt the next day.<br /><br />During this hunting trip things change. Both men are armed with bow and arrow combinations but its photography that interests Ford now. That is until an arrow goes whizzing past him, narrowly striking him in the head. Kovac reveals his true mission for being there, to take down Ford for what happened in the past (which I won't reveal here).<br /><br />The pair struggle through the woods back and forth, one having the advantage over the other and then switching as circumstances change things. Through it all they continue to talk about the horrors of war and what it means to those who fought in them. Just who will survive this confrontation in the woods isn't revealed until the end of the film.<br /><br />As I said, it was nice to see DeNiro playing a role that could actually suit his age. Had he been in the Bosnian War he would have been in his 50s and how he looks now he could have been in his 40s. As a career military man that's possible. His character is one who is tormented by his past, what he saw and what he participated in. Here we are 18 years later and he still hasn't come to terms with that. That makes for the subtle parts of the character he plays here.<br /><br />Travolta also fits the age bracket for this role. Sporting a semi-beard and a thick accent, he pulls off the role of Kovac with ease. There are many who would say that Travolta was just a pretty boy in most of his roles but they would be doing him a disservice. He brings a depth to Kovac that proves he is quite capable of bringing something to a role that some refuse to see. He's a much better actor than given credit for and proves so here.<br /><br />KILLING SEASON offers a combination of story and action that holds your interest from start to finish. You want to find out what the back story is, you want to know if Kovacis seeking justice or revenge, you want to know just what has twisted Ford's head for these 18 years and if he will change. The movie may not be Oscar material but it does offer a nice combination of entertainment and thought provoking story that makes it worth watching.is seeking justice or revenge, you want to know just what has twisted Ford's head for these 18 years and if he will change.

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great conclusion to the series. With Sanderson writing the pace increased and it was mostly about closure. For having another writer take over the project, I can't imagine a better ending
B005LAII4E|4.0|I saw this film when it came out and wondered how it would hold up on DVD. The answer is quite well. If for some reason you don't know what G.I.Joe is there was a set of toys in the 60s that consisted of 12\\" tall dolls for guys based on the military put out by Hasbro. But they really took off in the 80s when they were made only 6\\" tall and came with all sorts of characters, gadgets, vehicles and their own cartoon show. If you loved those toys you're almost certain to love the movies, especially G.I.JOE: RETALIATION.<br /><br />This time around Cobra Commander is held prisoner along with Despero, both captured at the end of the first film. Commander's right hand man Zartan is posing at the U.S. President (Jonathan Pryce) thanks to nanomites, microscopic robots that make him physically appear to be him. As the film opens someone has killed the President of Pakistan and the \\"President\\" sends the Joes in to capture their nuclear bombs before terrorists can do so.<br /><br />While this is going on a rescue attempt on Cobra Commander is in progress. I won't say much more than that so as to not ruin a few surprises here including the introduction of new Cobra member Firefly. Suffice to say it succeeds and the Commander is back in the saddle of all things evil once again.<br /><br />Now led by Duke (Channing Tatum) the team drops in to take out the base and capture the nukes. Along with Duke are Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki), Flint (D.J. Cotrona) and several other Joes. They succeed in their mission only to be bombed and shot by a group of Cobra helicopters. Only Roadblock, Jaye and Flit survive. Afterwards the \\"President\\" blames the assassination on the Joes and outlaws any remaining members.<br /><br />The three remaining teammates return to the states to find answers as to what happened. They know that the President was the only person with enough power to order their termination and set out to get more intell. Roadblock, now in charge, turns to the only man he trusts, the original G.I.Joe, Gen. Joe Cotton (Bruce Willis). If the team can get enough evidence to prove what is going on, Cotton and a few friends will help them save the country.<br /><br />While this is going on Snake Eyes (Ray Park), the secretive ninja style Joe, is out to save the honor of his dojo and capture Storm Shadow. Climbing the peaks of a snow covered along with fellow good ninja Jinx (Elodie Young), they capture their prey and head out followed by Shadow's evil ninja bodyguards. What follows is an amazing fight sequence along the face of the mountain from ropes that has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />Once the Joes are reunited and sides are taken they are informed of what Cobra Commander is up to. As is always the case it involves world domination, blowing up well known locations and general mayhem. What it results in is a rip snorting good time filled with action, gadgets and those well love vehicles that fans of the cartoons and toys remember so well.<br /><br />The movie offers exactly what you would expect, plenty of non-stop action, some thrilling fight sequences, lots of things blowing up and all those vehicles I mentioned. The new characters like Roadblock and Gen. Cotton mix in well with the ones from the first film and the bad guys are just as evil as you would expect. Are there plot holes or things that make no sense? Sure if you look for them. But instead just go in looking for that action that you love so well when it comes to these characters and movies.<br /><br />There isn't a weak performance in this film. Everyone plays up to the standards you would expect for the Joe team and the bad guys. The effects that are on screen prove that this production put its money where its mouth was. By the end of the film if you aren't on the edge of your seat yelling for the Joe's to kick butt then something is wrong. You'll also find yourself witnessing something rare in films these days, an honest to goodness hero that can be looked up to. Granted, there is some rougher language used than in those old cartoons and people do get killed. But on the whole this is one action flick not to miss.n be looked up to. Granted, there is some rougher language used than in those old cartoons and people do get killed. But on the whole this is one action flick not to miss.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|A blend involving King's personal journeys and the craft that has become his life, and lucky we the readers are that he chose writing as his life's work. Gobbled the book up, reading it in one day.
B00ELOOYZI|4.0|If you don't have access to KSP (Kerbal Space Program) at the moment, then Simple Rockets does a nice job of satisfying your lust for rocket science.  I have been playing KSP for almost a year now, and have become accustomed to the mods and style of gameplay.  Switching to this takes a bit of getting used to, but it is fun and the physics are pretty solid.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|And the mountains echoed is a beautifully written novel. Part fable, all truth. The characters are wonderfully depicted and the history in the piece is illuminating. I loved the book!
B003O86FMW|4.0|A very easy and good read with a lot of action. I really enjoyed it. Can't wait to read the next one!
B001NLL8LA|4.0|The book intrigued me from the first page and so I continued. Some of action shown was a bit too graphic for me, and I had to hide my heart and eyes, but, a always, Lee Child created a fine book.
0385349947|2.0|As a young woman planning on starting her career soon I feel like this is not the right book for me. I have never felt like I hold myself back from anything, I think this book would've served its purpose if she had assumed that point instead of trying to build self esteem. I have always fought side by side with \\"men\\" and never felt a big difference. Perhaps she directed this to the most conservative households, and even then, I come from a conservative household and never felt the fear of aspiring for bigger things in life because, in other words, I'm smart. I belong to the smartest species on Earth, everyone is good at different things and I like exploring the things I can be good at, without limits. The book starts from the limit working its way around it, never getting you out. It is a splendid history book, but it does not represent the smart women in my generation. There are just not enough good jobs for everyone, and  for some women it looks easier to ask men for things than standing up and getting them themselves. It is their \\"god-given\\" choice.<br /><br />GET EMPOWERMENT ELSEWHERE<br /><br />With that being said, the book got here on time and in great conditions!
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book was a puzzle, a wonderfully constructed puzzle and I was caught in its web. I came to understand both main characters deeply and well, but the ending put me off. Cold blooded murder can be overlooked because your emotionally sick and controlling lover makes you a better man? I could not handle the ending. How about being a fuller person without forgiving a cold blooded murderer who may kill the child she's carrying as well.
B008U3NU38|2.0|I have to agree with the other reviewer, I too am having problems playing the CD's. I was counting down the days for the release of this box set and was stoked to get it, but when I tried playing the CD's my CD player would not read the discs. I tried playing them on my imac and it also would not recognize them. The only discs I got to play where the 3 Sound System Extra CD's with all the bonus material because those are silver back cd's apposed to the regular album cd's that are all black back cd's to replicate the vinyl. I emailed Sony and the response I got back was, \\"are you sure you are not trying to play the dvd's in your cd player\\", what a joke. The Clash is my favorite band and the box set is awesome, but for what it costs and to not be able to listen to the cd's, not to mention the response I received back from Sony. I am very disappointed. So before you drop a couple hundred dollars on this box set you might want to consider that it may not play in your system and that the makers of this box set don't really CARE. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK.
B00ET7EON4|5.0|Another great set from Arctic Monkeys, closer to Humbug the Suck it and See - and if you're a fan of Humbug, you'll love this.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I liked the story. I don't think it is so much like 50 Shades and it is not a good read. I hate the cliff hanger endings though.
B004XZ99LO|3.0|Typically, Cirque Di Soleil is a non-stop dance, song and acts of skill.  This attempts to keep that spirit, however looses its momentum repeatedly and becomes a little awkward and lacking traditional flow.  In a typical stage show there are musical interludes between acts but the show stays alive throughout, even in act transitions, this does not have that spirit and energy.<br /><br />The costumes, make-up and acts continue to be stellar, but the real life atmosphere takes away the magic although providing a new way to see a show.  Not to mention, the music is not as memorizing as other shows.<br /><br />It is unique in 3D and new concept for cirque video, however if you only intend to see this in 2D, this is not a show worth spending the money on.

B00AYB0TOW|3.0|I'm not sure why this was called Dredd since it had next to nothing to do with the original Dredd story.
B004EF6632|5.0|This is the second time my wife and I watch it and I must admit I had forgotten the plot. There is nothing to dislike about it, except it is maybe too short and the ending not being  longer as well. There is a great plot, great acting and cinematography. I totally enjoyed the smart dialogue and the drama. Daniela Denby-Ashe does a great job personifying a strong, smart, assertive woman who isn't afraid to speak her mind. A great short series by BBC. Another great adaptation from the novel.
B00E5INZ82|5.0|THIS IS ONE COOL GAME THAT ALSO HAS GREAT EFFECTS!!! WASN'T FOR SURE AT FIRST, BUT IT KEPT GETTING BETTER!!
B001EBWINQ|5.0|First time in 25 years I watched this movie.  What a beautiful movie.  The art direction, the love and sacrifice.  The brotherhood.  The photography.  All of it was awesome.
B00CTT9646|4.0|As others have written the special features split up is without a doubt very frustrating, so I won't rehash.  The idea behind a \\"Limited Edition\\" or \\"Special Edition\\" should mean just that, the buyer is getting something more than they would in a normal release.  It just doesn't happen here.  The box and packaging material are done very well, so that the phaser replica is nice and safe along with the DVD w/slipcase as well, both nice and snug in a Styrofoam cocoon of sorts.  All versions of the movie (3D/Blu Ray and DVD) play well with no issues (other than the lack of aforementioned extras...) and the phaser replica from Qmx seems to be done pretty well.  Except here again we run into an issue of purchasing a \\"Limited Edition\\" and not getting something special.  The phaser itself is made in a very decent manner, don't get me wrong.  It has nice clean lines and from a few feet away looks absolutely great, but there are a few areas lacking some detail upon closer inspection.  Mainly around the buttons and smaller fin detailing, again nothing major that would severely detract from the piece.  Except along the left side of the upper \\"housing\\" there are several warped areas that clearly were noticed during final assembly/finishing.  As it's apparent that these areas were sanded with a heavy grit and repainted in an attempt to fix the issue, unfortunately it didn't. What it did do is leave some obvious sanding marks that allowed for the paint not to match the rest of the replica... Maybe it's just mine or maybe the entire production run had the same issue, only time will tell.  All in all I'd give the combo pack a 7.5; 3.5 out of 5 for the movie and lack of features and 4 out of 5 for the phaser replica with unprofessional finish.

1475143389|5.0|I read this book in one sitting. It's pretty much everything I have ever questioned pertaining to fitness and nutrition summed into one read. A few of the reviews I have seen criticize the lack of an exact diet regiment. I personally love the fact that it doesn't have that, but instead has a very specific guideline to forming your own plan. It helps you personalize your diet to fit your own needs. I use an application called \\"Fat secret\\" to keep up with my carbohydrate-fat-protein ratios, and it is fantastic, because it lists your daily intake of all of this right at the top. Bottom line to this criticism: Everybody is different and one meal plan doesn't work for everyone. If you're too lazy to create your own meal plan, you're probably too lazy to incorporate this book's teachings into your lifestyle.<br /><br />As far as the fitness routine this book builds. I've been lifting weights for 10 years off and on, and I have never had a workout be so easy yet kick my ass so hard at the same time. I've also never lifted this heavily, and damn.. It makes a difference. I do recommend researching and becoming VERY familiar with some of these exercises proposed in this book, to ensure proper form. Mike Matthews gives some great sources for doing this.<br /><br />The supplement guide is great as well. I feel like this is one of the largest grey areas for most people (myself included). It's very nice to see someone break it down and eliminate the BS. The bonus report gives an entire regiment to supplement timing, and that's a big help.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking to get into great shape and shred body fat. I purchased Muscle Myths as well and look forward to reading that in the next few days. Thanks Mike, and fantastic work with this book!

B00DQVSTCG|5.0|The Blu-Ray version of Madonna's MDNA 2012 World Tour is amazing.  It's packed with so much energy, it almost jumps off the screen. She looks awsome.  The dancers are the bomb.  The music sounds great and Madonna's voice sounds strong and clear.  The video is clean and sharp, like a Blu-Ray disc should be.  As for the content itself, the concert looks great.  Madonna and her team were able to capture the true spirit of the show without compromise.  I am very happy with my purchase and I feel like I got what I paid for; an incredably accurate documentation of one of the best concerts ever produced.

B00BSWMITK|4.0|Another great melodic masterpiece from Joe. He has always been a tasty player, but I feel like over the years he has gone from trying to blow your head off with flash and technique, to creating music that appeals to all music fans (not just guitarists). This one does not move me quite as much as his last studio release &#34;Wormhole Wizards and Black Swans&#34; but it is still quintessential Satch and worthy of a place in your CD collection.

B004X80QNG|4.0|I like this app for the fact that it gives me more options for customizing my calendars and events.  It also has a function that makes it easier to enter the same event multiple times by saving it as a template.  Unfortunately, this particular feature is temperamental and does not always work for me.  Oftentimes, when I try to load a saved template it crashes the app.  That is why I am giving this app 4 stars instead of 5.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|I just LOVE the Angry Birds &quot;other&quot; games, BUT this one is just sort of annoying &amp; Rovio just put out ANOTHER  Angry Birds game. Yes, it was FREE, BUT, it's sort of &quot;Stupid FREE&quot;. I would suggest you to think about obtaining this &quot;FREE&quot; game.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|The interface was a bit difficult to get used to and navigate.  I spent quite some time trying to figure out how to get the font type and size just right so that I could see the things that I was trying to put on my calendar.  It does a great job of syncing with all of my various calendars though.  The agenda tap is quite nice as well as it shows me at a glance everything scheduled for the day.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really really enjoyed this game.  It's definitly on of my favorites.  I enjoyed the hidden objects and puzzles.  There was a good story line and it didn't leave you hanging as so many games do.  I reccomend it any one who likes this type of game

The way these two characters related to each other  made this book a &#34;feel good&#34; book even though the main topic was a difficult one.  I am not an avid reader, but I could not put this book down.  I  fully recommend this book.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I love this app!! It does everything it's supposed to! I love how it takes only about 5 seconds to tell u what song or tv show is playing and it's the coolest thing ever when you Shazam a sport, like baseball for example, when Shazamed, it tells you who's up for bat and everything about the player! I love it. It sometimes doesn't have the song or show in their records but that's ok!!!
0756407915|2.0|The characters and writing are entertaining.  The plot is bloody boring and I don't understand the hype.  I don't like Martin's books because they're excessively dark and aimless in direction, but at least events occur.  I love Sanderson's books to give you perspective.  If you like plots to move along quickly and struggle with ADHD like myself, give Mistborn or any of Sanderson's books a day in court.<br /><br />That said, I admire Rothfuss...he's a great, funny person and something needs to be said about his skills if I lasted the entire book without much reward.

0425267695|5.0|I read through the few negative reviews after reading this and am confused.  I can't articulate why the book deserves 5 stars, yet I know it does.  Some of the complaints are legitimate..and yet my attention was engaged on the book for a day straight till it was completed.  Everything is very solid in the book.  The character development is good, but not great.  The action scenes are good, but not great.  The world building is good, but not great.  The pacing is good, but not great.  That pretty well characterizes the entire novel. But when every aspect is good (3.5 Stars), the book somehow as a whole becomes great (4.5 to 5 Stars).  My only complaint would be that the book is linear, but it's more like reading a George R.R. Martin book while constantly skipping everyone but Jon's point of view.  I didn't feel like there weren't things going on off-stage, but that they were only being hinted at.  Instead of a grand pattern being weaved before my eyes, it felt like I was seeing a tapestry from the view of one thread.  Yet somehow it was constantly satisfying.<br /><br />Edit: Concering the grammar, I bought a physical copy of the book.  Either I was so absorbed in the book I didn't notice the grammar issues (Which is reasonably common for me) or the physical copy went through some sort of edit.
B008RV5K5E|4.0|There is only one thing preventing me from giving this 5 stars. Michael Ironside did the voice of Batman in an adaption/excerpt of this story called Legends of the Dark Knight which aired on The New Batman Adventures which was a continuation of WB Animation's Batman: the Animated Series. I feel his performance in the earlier adaption was much better than Peter Weller's in this version. In my opinion Keven Conroy's Batman is the definitive Batman but Michael Ironside brought a gravitas and brutality to his version of Batman that Peter Weller was not able to match. I can buy Peter Weller as anything from Robocop to a Starfleet Admiral, just not Batman.

0385528787|5.0|I'll begin with a contentious statement: I think Margaret Atwood is our greatest living novelist. She introduced more than one generation of American readers to the largely unexplored world of Canadian literature, and her 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale is rightfully given a lofty place on the shelf alongside the likes of Orwell and Huxley. Over the course of her nearly half-century career, she has amassed an impressive body of work that ranks her amongst the all time greats. Any attempt I make at critiquing a Margaret Atwood novel is done with the understanding that I am comparing it mostly in relative terms, holding it against the standard set by the rest of her canon.<br /><br />  MaddAddam, probably the most eagerly anticipated novel of Atwood's career, is the final chapter in her dystopian trilogy that began with 2003's Oryx and Crake and left off with 2009's The Year of the Flood. Rather than a plot unfolding in successive chronological sequence, the first two books in the series told parallel coterminous stories of the events leading up to the collapse of human civilization. The structure was interesting, and proved ultimately more satisfying than George R.R. Martin's attempt at using similar techniques with A Feast for Crows and A Dance With Dragons. As with any final piece of a trilogy, MaddAddam has a lot of work to do in terms of tying up loose ends and appeasing the often unrealistically high expectations of fans while also working as a novel in its own right.<br /><br />  MaddAddam succeeds, but, unusually for an Atwood novel, I wasn't entirely certain of its merits until the final few pages. Although Toby once again takes primary narration duties here, chronicling the day to day life of the world's surviving humans as they struggle to survive in the immediate aftermath of a societal collapse in a new world they now share with the \\"Crakers\\" , much of the book is spent on the backstory of Zeb, and one's interest in this particular character will factor heavily into one's enjoyment of the novel.  That Zeb's story is masterfully written goes without saying -- Atwood's prose has a confidence to it that I love and admire, a voice that is clearly and unmistakably her own: wry, sharp, and direct. It's without comparison, although I can possibly stretch to say that it has something in common with Shirley Jackson if Jackson had decided that she no longer cared about what anyone thought of her, stopped being afraid of the villagers, and wrote with a bit more freedom.  The problem is never with the writing (Margaret Atwood's grocery list would probably be a more captivating read than the majority of novels currently in print, and she would somehow make the choice between two different brands of yogurt seem like a haunting tale of alienation that examines the crippling limitations of the human spirit). The problem, for me, is that I was so invested in the story she has built around the people I already care about in this world that I wanted less of Zeb and was preoccupied with that classic question that burns at the core of all good literature: what happens next?<br /><br />  Atwood keeps us asking this question, and when answers do eventually come, they are satisfying. On our way there, we get to see Toby -- a classic Atwoodian protagonist -- wrestle with the personal struggles of aging, jealousy, vanity, and anxiety, against the larger struggles of the post-apocalyptic world that make her feel frustrated by what she views as her own frivolity. Toby is strong, and much of her strength comes from the fact that she perceives herself as weak.<br /><br />  This is a weird novel, and it's refreshing to see a writer so deeply into a career continue to experiment with different kinds of storytelling. Atwood uses an interesting technique here to bring us into this world. The Crakers (a biologically engineered humanoid species created by genius/mad scientist Crake as an experiment in correcting all of humanity's flaws), abandoned andleft to die in a lab after the death of Crake and the rest of mankind, are rescued by Jimmy, whom they come to view as a sort of messiah figure. When Jimmy becomes ill, it is Toby who has to assume his duties as storyteller. The Crakers possess a childlike curiosity about their own history as well as the stories of the surviving humans, and the fact that much of the the novel is written as an oral history gives it an unexpectedly mythic quality that wasn't present in the earlier two books. We join the Crakers as Toby's audience, and there is something strange and effective about hearing the stories of our species -- our strengths, our weaknesses, and our eventual downfall -- from this perspective.<br /><br />  The novel also surprised me with its humor -- Atwood's novels are always infused with a dry wit, but this is probably the funniest of her career. The cultural misunderstandings between the two surviving sentient species provide a backdrop not only for laughs (the Crakers come to understand the f-word as a deity to be called upon in times of need), but also as a way of learning more about both. It also serves as a brilliant way to make us question much of what we take for granted as \\"fact\\". There were times where I nearly felt as impatient as Toby herself about wanting to get through to the rest of the story, but these scenes are so well written that it doesn't matter.<br /><br />  MaddAddam poses many questions about how best to rebuild a society that is forced to go back to its roots and start over again. Atwood offers some complex and multifaceted ideas to the reader -- there are times where the world of MaddAddam seems to renounce all science and genetic engineering in favor of a more simple return-to-nature lifestyle, yet it is precisely the results of what occurred in those labs that give us our greatest hope for our salvation from the destruction and chaos they brought about in the first place. There are also questions posed about the role of storytelling and myth-making and what defines us as \\"human\\". Yet despite the heaviness of the subject and the philosophical and ethical questions it brings, Atwood never moralizes, and infuses the entire novel with enough of her signature wit and self deprecating humor to make it a delight to read. Interestingly, the apocalypse is never exactly mourned or lamented -- when these characters yearn for the past, it's mostly matters of convenience and comfort that they are missing, and one gets the sense that humanity really did need a good culling.<br /><br />  It is a bleak future that Atwood paints -- a world where both the coffee AND the chocolate crops have failed is not one that I have any interest in ever seeing -- and throughout this series our species does not always appear in its best light. However, as the novel reaches its final pages, Atwood leaves us with some sense of hope and redemption. \\"The waterless flood\\" has cleansed the Earth of most of our past sins, and although the chance that we will be doomed to repeat history is ever present, she offers us the possibility that things -may- be different.  It is not a starry-eyed and sententious hope -- Atwood is way too wry and pragmatic for that -- but it is a realistic, cautious hope. And despite parts of the novel leaving me hungry for -more-, it is a wonderful message to take away from what is ultimately a satisfying end to this powerful and unforgettable trilogy.

B0043UB0EI|5.0|Great show and one of the best I've seen.  Very well written and close to Roman history.  So bloody and yet so sexy in many ways.  Definitely recommend to everyone to watch.  I was very sad the final season ended.

B00942Y4IY|4.0|Awesome summer blockbuster, you have an improbably scenario, a band of ragtag Americans, a bad guy, a lovely lady and the need to save an entire civilization from slavery.  It's not Shakespeare, but it doesn't have to be, it is fun and quick moving enough to dissolve some disbelief and provide amusement.

I marked the date for the 3rd season's release on my calendar and quickly consumed the whole of this season in 4 days. I am at a loss now that I have to wait for the 4th season. If you like period dramas, this is a must watch!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle recounts his becoming and serving as a U.S. Navy SEAL sniper with admirable candor.  From Cowboy to SEAL, his story is exceptional, demonstrating patriotism and extreme dedication to his calling. I've read a lot of SEAL biographies. This book spends less time on BUDS and SEAL training than others, but still shows how hard it is physically and mentally to earn the Trident. Much of the book discusses his tour(s) of duty and his teammates. He also reveals how incredibly taxing the life of a special operator is on family life. The sections in which his wife tells her story emphasize this point. SEALs suffer incredible hardships in training and on duty, but like all soldiers, their sacrifices run much deeper than many people can appreciate.<br /><br />I listened to this autobiography as an audio book. The narrator, John Pruden, did a good job. Anyone who is interested in Special Forces or Navy SEALS in particular will find this a worthwhile read / listen. I also enjoyed the book because it seems that prime time news has forgotten to report on the men and women serving our country overseas.

But I did it to get that mail out of my box. Not only can I not gift or do much of anything with FB friends, since I connected to FB it won't stay connected more than a few minutes. I don't have a connection issue with anything but this app. And there is no benefit to me connecting it with Facebook. It's just so the app can post junk on my wall. And now there's no way I can find to unconnect. You'll like it a lot but don't connect it to Facebook because after that you can't play anymore.

B008NW67E0|4.0|One of my children gave me \\"Babel\\" to find out what I thought of this latest phenom -- and it's not bad.  Their biggest asset so far, I think, is Marcus Mumford's attractively raspy voice, which maintains its character whether he's singing loudly or softly, and he delivers his words with total commitment.  The lyrics themselves are a bit too self-consciously poetic, but they fail to resonate in the way that Dylan's or Simon's or Cohen's did in their culture.  All that said, though, they aren't just a tissue of cliches.  The band's sound is attractively airy, but they depend too much on loud strumming banjo effects.  It's not clear that any of them are really skillful instrumentalists -- that might be being unfair, but if it is, somebody has to write the music to showcase that skill.  There's a definite striving to give the songs an \\"anthemic\\" feel, and that might be militating against interesting playing.  I think all the songs work pretty well -- \\"Babel\\" and \\"Lover of the Light\\" linger in my memory more than the others.  I look forward to seeing how they develop.

Embarrassing!<br /><br />Third, best version to buy....Targets!  Two additional STUDIO songs.  QVC adds some retreads and so does Best Buy's.  Get Target's and you will be rewarded handsomely!!  They ARE NOT throwaways tracks at all.

Connects quickly and easily to my TV and syncs perfectly with my Asus Tablet, Iphone and Galaxy S3.  I primarily use it to cast Netflix, and Youtube for now and the quality is near perfect.  I know that most likely they will add more third party apps to this, but it definitely does what it's advertised to do.  I also like the fact that I can cast from my laptop, my chrome browser which is an extra added bonus.

But \\"Wool\\" is so original, so well written, and so completely compelling that after reading the afterword in which author Hugh Howey says that he reads \\"every single review on Amazon, I promise\\", I had to write to add my praise the the many thousands who have preceded me.<br /><br />Well done, Hugh!  Wow!<br /><br />OK.  Obligatory synopsis as short as I can make it (which is not very).  The entire world is a \\"Silo\\".  A cylindrical subterranean man-made structure with 144 levels, the silo is a completely self-contained and self-sustaining ecosystem. The only way up or down is by walking.  The silo is several hundred years old.  Outside, only visible through a video camera feed is a barren, desolate, toxic wasteland that is completely uninhabited and uninhabitable.  Folks in the silo work in different sectors, divided by levels, that are responsible for different tasks necessary to the functioning of the silo itself.  The lowest levels are devoted to mechanical infrastructure, above that are the hydroponic farms (these are actually scattered over several sections), upper mid is IT and the uppermost levels are the political, economic and law enforcement agencies.  Everything runs smoothly.  The only thing that one cannot do is think to much about, or express a desire to \\"leave\\".  One day the wife of the current sheriff discovers something hidden deep within the IT servers that shatters her world and as a result, she  wants out.  Those that break the law, including expressing a desire to leave, are suited up to help them survive the intolerable conditions outside and sent out \\"to clean\\" the video sensors and die.  Sheriff's wife goes to clean.  3 years later the Sheriff follows her.  The current Mayor and Deputy Sheriff walk all the way down to Mechanical to seek out a replacement Sheriff, one Juliette Nichols, who had been helpful on a murder investigation a few years back.  And then the story really takes off.<br /><br />Wool is addicting, tight as a drum, extremely well-edited... I don't really have enough adjectives.  Just found out the 20th Century Fox bought the rights and Ridley Scott is going to direct.  Wow again.  OK, Hugh, I hope you liked the feedback. I'm off to download the next in the series, \\"Shift\\".<br /><br />Very Highly Recommended.<br /><br />J.M.

B0025WX2YW|5.0|Well worth our time watching this.  It is a continuation of history as we know it.  We look forward to each episode.
B008VIKLWA|5.0|Extraordinary filming and a great production.  I can watch it over and over again.  Good lesson for humanity too :).
B0076D21O2|5.0|I loved the plot twist for William Shakespeare, and the naughty and shocking twists concerning Elizabeth; rather than portraying her as a demi-god, she has been given baser human needs and desires. Not all period films concerning these beloved characters must remain true to the picture history has painted or even of the facts; color OUTSIDE the lines and explore the prospect of &#34;What If?&#34;  That is what this film allows.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I wish it had redstone like the Pc or xbox version because I want contraptions. It needs to stop some of the glitches too
B000OLRH10|2.0|I was watching this for the first time with a person who had seen it at least a dozen times.  He had to explain things that had happened because the video was cut up---scenes and parts of scenes were missing.  I have no idea why it would be edited, and it certainly doesn't state that it is...  but when I pay to rent something (not even available free for Prime customers) then I expect to get the whole movie.  This will certainly keep me from renting through Amazon again.
0802473156|4.0|Great book for couples to read I am using it for psychology class love it  great tool for relationships great but
B009WO7NQO|3.0|Every time I try to play the Endor levels it crashes, I really like the game just hope it's fixed soon
B000MV90JY|5.0|Nashville Skyline is my all time favorite Dylan album and I just bought another copy as my original is no longer playable. Excellent!
B00821OX98|4.0|This is a fun Sci Fi series. They are very good at keeping the interest up with twists and surprise events.
B005LAIH2C|4.0|If you like movies with a lot of action, great special effects and a good cast this movie is for you.  Yes it is hokey at times and downright silly at times but it does have some entertainment factor and it will hold your attention.<br /><br />Hanzel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) do a great job in portraying these athletic and skilled witch hunters.  The chase scenes and fight scenes are very good but graphic and bloody.  This is a film for those that just want to watch it and be entertained.  We watched it on DVD but it is another one of those films that it is better to stream to your home and watch it one time and not spend the money for the DVD unless you get a good deal.<br /><br />It is gory and it contains some language and nudity but it is rated as an R movie so make sure that you select your audience properly.  This is not a child's fairy tale unless you want to scare the pants off of them.<br /><br />I rated the film as a 4 star movie and it is worth watching once.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is totally awesome,it has absolutely no glitches and is the most intensive fantasy game that I played in my entire life. I would recommend the blades master or swordsman. There the strongest.
B0090SI4LU|4.0|I read this book and my wife and I also listened to it in audio CD format.  We basically knew the story line and we liked the book a lot.  The movie was OK but for me it was not as good as the book.  I won't put a lot of spoilers into this review but the book just simply goes into much more detail and it helps you to understand both sides of the story better.  You gain a feeling for the alien's motives and also the feelings of the humans.<br /><br />In book the lead protagonist (Melanie Stryder) is a rebel who is a tough and smart woman who is taken over by an alien.  Her responses to situations and her character is tough, intelligent and a real fighter.  In the movie the character comes over more as a pushy and snippy young woman that is much more immature than the Melanie in the book.  It changes the tone of the film in a way that I did not relate to after reading the book.<br /><br />I liked the premise of the book a lot but movie was just OK.  I thought the cast did the best they could with a chopped up script that just did not carry the story line as well as the book.  For me it is worth watching and perhaps just streaming it to your home but I am not sure if it is worth purchasing the DVD as its replay value is limited.<br /><br />I rated the movie at 3 ½ stars and rounded it up to a 4 star rating.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|I loved this movie!!! So good. A definite must watch! The action is amazing and keeps you on the edge of your seat, the acting is awesome and the characters are memorable. fast cars + hot guys? Yes Please!
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|We enjoyed.it and we didn't predict the outcome which was a huge plus !! Would have been nice to see at the theater first but our 55 inch plasma screen helped !!
B001NUO1HE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie a lot. I like the actors, the setting and the plot. I thought the movie was well done and I would watch it again. :)
B000SW2ER2|2.0|Nothing at all like the book. Mediocre space love story. Solaris plays an integral part in the novel (it is titled Solaris afterall), the film version has a few lame shots of a ball of glowing plasma.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|I really like the series but I do have a problem understanding the male lead when he speaks.  Will continue to watch!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the minions and I love this game.  I will spend hours playing it it's my go to game wherever I am especially if I am gonna have a long wait or may get bored or need to kill time.  I even got my sister, my nephew and my sister's baby daddy hooked on this game.  I even play the game with the sound on who h I never do cause gaming music on perpetual repeat drives me crazy so I always play games on mute but the minions are so cute I just got to hear them.
B004RKXNDU|3.0|Slow to develop, lots of peculiar British terminology and jargon. I stalled 1/4 of the way through. Not in a hurry to get back to it.
B004XMMSZG|5.0|Received this Bluetooth marvel about 2 weeks ago.  It took longer to open the package than for it to pair up to my Yamaha TSX-70 clock radio.  I have a IPhone 4S and have also used the Dockboss on a IHome speaker unit and a stock car receiver.  All have paired up immediately, works as advertised.  Buy it!
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King is famous for once declaring that his fiction is the Big Mac of literature. But over the years he has produced stories like The Body, Bag of Bones, and Dolores Clairborne - yes there are macabre and violent elements to them all. But they also show us individuals struggling to make life work, and these tomes can easily hold their own when stood next to so-called literary fiction.<br /><br />The same is true for Joyland. The mystery surrounding the unsolved murder and the ghost that haunts the amusement park is only ostensibly at the center of the book. The real story is one of making friends, helping others, and giving people room to be who they are. And the real pleasure is the voice of the narrator and the way he walks us through his transition from heartbroken fool to mature adult. Another reviewer complains that the dialogue is a bit too clever and stylized. While this is something that would normally bother me. Here it doesn't. The narrator is after all a sixty year old man looking back on his life. The dialogue is his memory of how people spoke, and will inevitably end up idealized.<br /><br />And it is this looking back that allows for some of the book's best moments. For instance, the protagonist has a deep emotional moment with his father. The scene ends with a Zen-like deer sighting that symbolically conveys the gentle yet profound nature of the father-son connection. Later in the book the protagonist makes a quick reference to the deer in the woods to beautifully explain his feelings of connection to what will later become lifelong friends. By using such devices sparingly, King makes them all the more powerful.<br /><br />None of this is to say the ghost does not matter. It is essential to the narrator's understanding of himself and the world around him. Only rather than scaring the narrator (or this reader for that matter), the ghost serves to make the world a larger, more ominous and yet more wonderful place. If King was not known for literal ghost stories, this book would already be working its way into high school literature classes where the spirit world would be treated as grand metaphor. It could still happen; and the students who might read it will have the pleasure of discussing it with great fondness over beers when they reach their 60s.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B002C949KE|5.0|A book everyone needs to read. It has so many insights on our behaviors that would help anyone survive the jungle of marketing, economies and factors that surround us everyday.<br />Best read in years!
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|This race game has to do with knowing how to &#34;drift&#34; around corners (controlled skidding).  I like it as it takes some level of learning, without being impossible.  Good graphics too.
B00C5R8364|2.0|I've read and enjoyed a lot of Frederick Forsyth's novels.  This one disappoints on many levels.  The hero is a cliche of the scholar/military officer following in the traditions of his family. The writing suggests the use of a voice recorder, three weeks max. The treatment of why some Middle Easterners don't like Westerners follows the George Bush tradition of, \\"They hate our freedom\\". Perhaps effective propaganda, but bad writing.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|After watching the movie, I can see why Jennifer Lawrence received the Oscar. Too much swearing words but great acting.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Two days into it, I am very impressed with Chromecast.  With a stable internet connection, it performs beautifully.  Netflix works pretty well, although it occasionally seems to get stuck and does not transition to the next episode of a show after completing the one before it. Otherwise it streams very smoothly and maintained good picture quality.  Streaming the entire desktop (the experimental option) caused a fair amount of lag and skipping when I tried to cast a DVD and it does not seem ready to be used in that fashion.  Casting a live stream from ESPN also resulted in lag/skipping, although my internet connection is also likely to blame.  So far, it has really improved the way I use Netflix and I have been casting Pandora to my TV for better audio with great results.<br /><br />Still seems a bit buggy, and isn't perfect, but is a solid 4/5 and a reasonable alternative for those of us without a smart television.
B0000026NC|5.0|My wife and I attended one of Pink Floyd's Delicate Sound of Thunder concerts back in the 90s.  It was fantastic.  This CD brings back a lot of good memories from that concert.  Performances of old standards from Dark Side of the Moon, plus Another Brick in the Wall, and A Momentary Lapse of Reason all are spot on.  David Gilmour's vocals and of course his guitar playing are top of the line.
B000HF6XNG|5.0|Action = It Has it.<br />Fight Scenes = Has it (Very short ones but there and very well done)<br />Story = It has an Interesting Change to the Romeo Stories.<br />Sound Track = Not to bad either.
1476715904|5.0|Honestly, if I could give \\"Slammed\\" by Colleen Hoover more than a 5/5 star rating, I would in a heartbeat. That is how much I love Slammed.<br /><br />My attempt at some sort of \\"Slammed\\" review:<br /><br />First and foremost, I feel the need to explain how much of a disadvantage I was at going into this novel. For the friends who recommended \\"Slammed\\" to me, I hate you all for giving me the wrong impression! I was completely unprepared for this novel.<br /><br />From the synopsis, the reader is made aware that 18-year-old Layken Cohen has recently lost her father. Though I fully understand the emotional fallout that would accompany such a tragedy, I was by no means expecting the novel to be as heart-wrenching as it was.<br /><br />On a more positive and less depressing note, I thought it was really awesome and such a cool idea how Ms. Hoover integrated slam poetry into her novel. I, for one, have never been too enthusiastic when it came to poetry to begin with but I have to admit, I may like this concept of slam poetry. I would love to actually see it in person one day.<br /><br />Reminiscing...<br /><br />The only background knowledge I had on this type of poetry prior to the novel dates back to that movie made back in 1999 called Drive Me Crazy (based on the popular song by Britney Spears). You know the one with Melissa Joan Hart and Adrian Grenier? I remember the scene where character Adrian Grenier plays, Chase Hammond, is sitting in a coffee shop with his girlfriend and someone (maybe his girlfriend) is performing slam poetry. That is as far as my memory stretches so if I missed a detail, oh well, it was 13 years ago.<br /><br />Recommend?:<br /><br />Absolutely. \\"Slammed\\" is such as amazing novel, I would recommend it to any looking for a very powerful read. Yes, I won't mislead anyone. This novel deals with intense topics that will bring out the water works.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This one of the best minecraft I've ever seen for kindle fire hd .it's very fun great I have nothing else to say
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|... but I much prefer my Roku box. Like many other people, I have a separate Wifi network by the TV. This has been necessary to get a good strong signal for the various dongles attached to my TV/audio system. Chromecast relies on getting control commands over wifi, where everything else (Roku, Android stick, PS3) uses a remote. Therefore, your tablet or phone must be chained to your little wifi network by the TV. Next issue, many Android apps do not currently offer a Chromecast option. I use a Plex media server - great with Roku, laptop, tablet and phone, not so great with Chromecast.
B00DWZHTOU|4.0|Movie is a journey in itself. With all twist and turns it seems a ride. A well written and directed movie with appreciable casting. In all a must watch.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|The trailers I watched withheld details of the story, and understated the degree of dishabituating resolve of  the vigilante hero of the movie.  It's worth the 5.00 rental fee,  easily.
B00846REIS|1.0|This is not good. The 2 main characters are both rich and whiny. The sex is not sexy. It is not at all like 50 Shades of Grey. I am reading the next 2 books in the series because someone loaned me the books- i never would have bought them.
B005CGI3ZG|4.0|While watching the series again, and having all the episodes to watch, I loved the feeling of reliving the 90's and my teen years along with the characters.  There were some sections that the video seemed grainy or unstable, and I don't remember it being that way in the original, but maybe it was.  The only real downside to this is that the theme song is changed in Seasons 3-6.<br /><br />I like the look of the packaging, though I will say it's hard to get the discs themselves out of the tower, and that can be frustrating.<br /><br />Overall, I love having this collection, and it's nice to know I can relive the 90's whenever the mood strikes!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I absolutely love this show! This show is the best show on television right now. Too bad it's only got a season or two left.
B009G78EE2|5.0|AMAZING!! what a beautiful honest message. <3 Macklemore puts emotion into words. We need to follow the message of supporting our fellow man. As a Christian I believe we are all truly equal in Gods eyes and what a dissapointment it must be when we judge each other with such cruelty. Live on and be yourself!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Very simple and easy to use. Great for kids who can read the instructions and tasks. A little addictive too...
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|A wonderful piece of art, and a worthy follow up from the first HTDA album. Any fan of Reznor will appreciate this. Buy it, support the arts.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|EW made me aware of this trilogy, so it deserves a nod, but all the kudos go to Howey for coming up with a great read.<br />Thanks
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I think this game is awesome, and strangely addicting. I can't get past level 18!!!! So I think you should get it!
B006Z00R1Q|5.0|How bout watching all three PA in three days. I have to say this lead me to write a review. The last fifteen minutes are very suspenseful, and it has explained the reason and causes of the first and second.<br />The grandmother is the crux to what happens in these little girls tragic life. I feel sorry and scared for them. PA 3 finally tells all about these two, and how they got so damaged by a malevolent demon. Quite frightening and actually these Hollywood parlor tricks are not to far off from how these demons operate. think about that one...OK Don't think...You can weed out the stunts and deaths, and still hear it's roar and breath, but that Demon was pissed for a reason.<br />I'm not going to tell you why and how just find out now and watch it, with a close friend. I am alone at night and wont sleep for two days.<br />A must see for those into the PA series. 4 1/2 ****1/2
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great alarm for traveling. Easy to set and peace of mind knowing that it will let you know when to rise and shine. This should come standard with all e readers.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I am severely disapointed in this application.  I know it is free, but after installing it on my Kocasio Android Tablet running 4.0  I am really frustrated.  I purchased all these books and when I try to read a book I get to read for about 2 minutes and up pops the Kindle Store!  New recommendations!  It goes page to page with new books to buy, but I don't get to read the books I already purchased!  Only way it will function is I have to shut off Wifi completely, otherwise all I ever see is a sales pitch for Kindle store.  Buy, Buy, Buy! But i don't get to read any books!
B008Y6R8J8|5.0|Critics may not praise it, but that matters not to me! This movie takes place in a time when I was a teen, and just to relive that period in my life is a lot of fun. Kathleen Turner plays Kathleen Turner...that is, she is still pretty much in adult mode even having been transported back into her high school years. Her group of friends are pretty impressive! Nicholas Cage as her high school heartthrob, Jim Carrey, in one of his first roles shows some glimmer of what was to come later in his career. Maureen O'Sullivan and Leon Ames as her grandparents are warm and natural. I have watched this movie over and over many times, and continue to enjoy it. Going back to the 50's in this movie is relatively painless and quite a lot of fun. Suspend your reality-based thoughts, and just have a fantasy trip back in time.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I am a big fan of cerebral thriller mysteries.<br />Off the bat, It lost a star because I cannot stand Cruise as an Actor. (I would have seen it in the theaters earlier if it were not for him in the lead)<br />The second star was lost because of predictability. The beginning was a bit too spoon fed and the scenario for the opening tragedy was prototypical.  I am sure there were portions of the film which landed on the cutting room floor with the interviews of the families of the victims but, that would have detracted from Cruises screen time and action sequences.  The car chase in the middle was gratuitous and did little to evolve the plot. The overall story was good with decent character development making you care about the characters and there was a moment near the end where you begin to rethink the allegiance of a main character.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have loved all three seasons of Downton Abbey.  The show is so well written and the acting is &#34;off the charts&#34;!!!!  I wish it would never end!!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I am a big Sci-fi fan and took so long to see this film because I cannot stand the lead actor Tom Cruise which is the main reason why it lost a star.<br />The other star was lost because CGI does not make a film alone you still need a great story and characters. I presume the expenses of the CGI caused the subordinate characters to be under developed. Their roles could have enhanced the illusion and emphasized the turmoil within the lead character.<br />Poor box office attendance seems to reinforce that the viewers need more story to back the CGI.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|A slow go but worth it.  Hard to read due to outmoded use of words and terms and language from another century.  Caused a lot of dictionary searches, some of which were unsuccessful.  Good story, look forward to reading more from this classic author.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|The film is loaded with special effects which seems to consume most of the screen time. The character development is minimal and you never really become vested in the story line and care whether a character is imperiled, lives or dies. Like any magic show, the characters are two dimensional, you know the magician will not perish, so you are there just to be amused by the special effects. Mostly you are just waiting for the next action sequence which, are impressive and fun.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used to love this app but since it changed to ads and games and no weather I promptly deleted it from my kindle. Please change it back. Sometimes change is good but this is not one of those times.

B002AKPECW|5.0|I really enjoyed this one!<br /><br />Very colorful group of characters.  Definitely a different perspective on space and time.  Neat plot.  Probably one of the top three sci fi books I have read!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie provides an inspiring message to all fathers to give the gift of time with your children and realize that you are rich because God has given you the gift of a wife and children. You can have faith to trust God to work all things  for good in His way and in His time.

B005BCE7FQ|5.0|My toddler's favorite movie. She watches it everyday. And I actually don't mind, because I enjoy the movie too. It has a great storyline and the music throughout the movie makes you want to get up and dance. The colors used in the movie are also very bright and vibrant. Really a great movie for all ages.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Puts a new look on Pride and Prejudice.. Very witty, full of twists and very few dull moments.  I laugh and laugh.  Just loved it..

B003F3NEBG|5.0|Restored wonderfully. Color is perfect. If you enjoy Jane Austin's books, this is a must see movie for you. Highly recommended.
0345803493|1.0|I am not the person to read this type of book, but the advertising made it seem like it would be a &#34;great&#34; book to read and not for me and not the movie either.  Pure Trash........<br />llr

0345803485|1.0|I gave away all three of these books to someone else.  It is not my kind of reading and I just got caught up in all the hype of the advertisers.  I like some type of this kind of book, but way over the top for me.  Will not spend my money to go to the movie either.<br />llr
B000K4WPCC|4.0|Recommended to those who like to watch movies about magic, witchery, action, special effects and see the world of magic from the male's perspective.

B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My three year old does this game on her own and really enjoyed the puzzles and learning what letters start the words. She asks to pay it by name now. I love that the voice reads it back to them one they are completed. I also have a two year old who, I have to help but he too loves to play this and is now recognizing letters when they come up even if I chose out of sequence. And it keeps them occupied at each other's appointments, always a mother's helper
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I love this device. It has changed how I watch YouTube videos, movies and music.<br /><br />Currently this has a limited number of apps that work with it. I started using a few of these more such as YouTube and Google Music. Also the Cast the Tab feature is good but a work in progress. A little lag at when doing things but it's still in beta.<br /><br />I did have a few issue every now and then of it not connecting to my wifi.<br /><br />If i had more TVs I would get more of these and I am excited for more apps to come to this.
B0002V7O3S|5.0|It is very good. Thank you very much.<br />I loved it. I absolutely love that movie.<br />I'll cherish it for ever.
9382951008|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  I am on the last few pages and I am so upset that this story is ending.  I loved every minute of it.  Khaled Hosseini is such a passionate writer.  I wish he would write more frequently.

1455527475|2.0|Too much of the book is on life at GS, and his career trajectory till he gets shipped to London, which I though was not the point of this book. If GS really believes that the monies earned at GS were due to client lies, cross-dealing, double talking, all the negatives, he should return the $5M or so he probably earned at GS - don't think he is going to do that. Don't bother unless you can get from local library, and don't spend more than 2 hours on this.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying reading (actually listening to the audiobook now) this book. The story is good; the characters are engaging, and I can hardly wait for the final book in the trilogy to be published. I &#34;read&#34; the audiobook of &#34;The Fall of Giants&#34; and was thrilled to find the audiobook of this book at the library. I am listening to it in the car so I read my digital copy on my Kindle app on my phone to find out how this volume ends. I am enjoying the world history lessons as well as the fiction parts.
B00821OX98|5.0|My husband and kids started watching and I'm now hooked. Its been 4 days of watching this series. We love it!!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I love this book i have read the entire siris and watched both movies like 50 times! i cant descibe how much i love this bok!
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|Awesome sounds from this pair! I pray they do well together and make this work for both of them. Incredible voices!!!
B00BEIYOMC|5.0|Contrary to what others have said on this product, Insidious 2 is quite good, and is as good as the first if not better. Others have commented on the use of loud music, this is quite purposeful and is an excellent example of incidental music in the horror genre something so many horror films in the past ten to fifteen years have done poorly if at all.<br /><br />Insidious and the Conjuring are not gory movies, they don't have scenes depicting some guy in a skin mask wielding a chainsaw or a guy in a striped sweater with knives on his hands. If this is your definition of a good horror film, these two are not for you. They deal with the paranormal in a way different from the likes of Paranormal Activity, Grave Encounters, and other films. They rely heavily on atmosphere and the use of sound to create a strong emotional response to go along, appropriately, with the images on screen. I have watched hundreds of horror films, they are my absolute favorite genre, and I've seen all the campy classics, all the slashers, all the torture, zombie, and mass murderer films out there. These two movies, along with the Conjuring(also by Wan) are some of my absolute favorites because of the overall excellent execution of classic horror style.<br /><br />Everyone is different, and what scares people, or what entertains them is almost never the same. If you like Paranormal and Horror, give the James Wan films a shot, keep an open mind and let the atmosphere envelope you. If you go into it with the words of critics who may not watch horror films or of those who expect more action and gore you probably won't enjoy it.<br /><br />Five out of Five stars, one of the best horror films of the year.
B006Y5H74W|4.0|I really didn't think I would like this show with all of the singing and dancing but I did find myself really liking it.
B0001I561E|5.0|I ordered this movie on a Monday and received it Wednesday! I was so excited that I got it so quick! Haven't stopped watching the movie! We love it!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is an amazing game it has many cute characters and matches the movie very well. It is easy to understand and is very addicting.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I enjoy the show, the time period it represents, the characters who have developed so well.  I also, enjoy that it does not meander off into 21st century behavior and attitudes, but stays within the frame.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I enjoy the show on so many levels. It can be funny exciting and poignant in one episode. I recommend it to all my friends.
B007VTUYWW|4.0|Perfect casting with Angelina.  Fun movie to watch with the family...a good translation from the video game which we spent many hours playing.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|A must see for everyone. Paul Newman truly is &#34;cool&#34; in this role. One of his best - and he eats 50 eggs!
B008Y5UADK|3.0|Interesting plot with outcome that I should have predicted.  Didn't care for B/W format.  I thought the movie could have taken a better turn for the ending.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Saw the movie, and fell in the love with the music. How in the world did we miss this album? the lyrics, the musicians, are all stellar. keep it in my car to listen often
B003477DVK|4.0|This movie tells a good story.  Entertaining characters, good triumphs over bad (can't really say evil).  We follow the story of a boy and his dog and how the dog seems to understand what is important in this boys life and helps out when he can.
0140157352|4.0|I have read this book and had two of my employees read it, as required for their positions of leadership in my office. I think both were helped by it.
B005F6NA5G|4.0|How can you not like a CD with George Benson playing guitar and Joe Sample playing the piano. Benson's version of My Cherie Amour is very nice. I also like the arrangement on Tequila.
B00280LYHS|4.0|I'm a 32 year old self proclaimed nerd and I thoroughly enjoyed this series. I probably read the books too far apart and sometimes got characters confused but that's really my fault. I look forward to reading Riordan's next series!
B00EDF43MY|5.0|The kids love it. All aspects of the airport catered for. Well worth the money. Try the free app first
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|I would have loved it 20 years ago, but it seemed kind of adolescent to me now. When did this alternate timeline crap begin?<br />It worked in Fringe, but I hope this doesn't become a way for film makers to keep ancient story lines from fading into history.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Different role for McConaughey outside of his romantic comedies. The film still has lots of good humerous lines and plenty of drama, right up to the end. Also loved Macey in in PI supporting role. Good movie, interesting ending!
B0050N8N0Q|4.0|Some very good songs on here.  Likes Pumped Up Kicks, Helena Beat, Houdini, and Don't Stop Best.  Only didn't like Warrant.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This has become one of my favorite shows.  The acting is excellent and the characters for the most part are enjoyable.  Not so excited about the casual sex which makes women look like pushovers, but I assume that is a sign of the times.  The people of color are presented in intelligent roles which I appreciate.  The world too frequently see people of color portrayed in a demeaning and gangsta manner.  Definitely this is one of my favorite series.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It captured my undivided attention.  I actually had tears at the end. I could almost feel their pain, next please.
B005K17RU0|5.0|AccuWeather gives so much more detail in conditions and seems to give a more accurate account of what is happening.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|I love Sci-Fi. They did a wonderful job putting this movie together. It told a great story and stayed true to the characters.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Our grandkids love this app.  We have two granddaughters so my husband and I installed it on our each of our kindles.  The girls play with it non stop.  It allows them to be very creative.  Grandma and Granddad enjoy it too
B009WJ14FA|5.0|Black Crowes, Stax, Otis Redding, Wilson Picket, Blues, Funk, Rock, Sex. If any of those words make you drool then buy this album. They are one of the best young bands I know. No B.S. Enjoy it!
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|I look forward to watching Iron Man 3 again and again.  Great visuals, wonderful cast...and Pepper has a more active role!
B001F12J0C|5.0|I LOVE JASON BOURNE AND THESE THREE MOVIES GIVE YOU THE FIX YOU WANT.  I COULD WATCH THESE THREE MOVIES OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  MATT DAMON WAS THE BEST.
B00E97AZZK|4.0|Now You See Me has a very intricate plot, well played by a wonderful cast.  This is a movie I will enjoy watching again!
074322454X|5.0|ANYONE WHO IS PATRIOTIC AT ALL WILL LOVE THIS BOOK.  MY DAD WAS IN THE WAR AND IT STARTED ON D DAY ALL THE WAY TO THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE TO RELEASING THE HOLOCAUST PRISONERS.  IT REALLY GIVES YOU A GREAT HISTORICAL VIEW OF WWII.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over. The concept is so different from other movies. The movie has a lot of action in it, and there is so much going on, It's a little hard to keep track  of everything the first time through, and at the end you're left wondering....
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|ONCE AGAIN!!!  JJ Abrahms KILLS IT!!  I MEAN TOTALLY!  This is a fabulous sequel to Star Trek.  Action, fabo script and twist, emotion, great effects, and the same phenomenal cast as before, which is perfect!  The chemistry with all the cast is phenom and holds firm, true and believable; The movie wouldn't be the same without them.  Abrahms'is essential as director in his style of filming, from angles, to his beloved 'flares' is unique, so any other follow-ups would NOT be the same.<br /><br />I LOVED how there's a twist to this I NEVER saw coming, you'll know when you hear it!  I canNOT say enough about it. I watched it twice in one day!  ♥ ♥ ♥ IT!!!<br /><br />Can't wait for the 3rd one!!  WHEN WHEN WHEN!!!???  YES!!!!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I barely noticed that the music was taken out but to be honest I love this show so much, I don't mind it...all of the episodes in all of the seasons plus the two daria movies :)
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|This is simply a classic.  What more can be said?  Hell, I've been waiting for someone, anyone to re-release this in an affordable version for years.  When I think of the top ten live albums of all time, this EASILY sits among the top five: the sound quality is fantastic; you can't ask for a better selection of Wings songs; McCartney is in great voice; and the band is tight and crackling.
034580404X|2.0|I got so tired of (he is so great looking and sexy or she is so beautiful).  To much describing every little thing.<br />It didn't impact me at all. It didn't live up to all the hype. If Oprah hadn't had it on her show I doubt it would have made it. I have read better paper backs.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|From the announcement, I thought it would stream from a Chrome browser on your phone or tablet.  But, it doesn't.  That is what I bought it for.  It has netflix, but so does my Roku and PS3.  It has Youtube, but so does my tablet.  I am hoping for an update soon.  Otherwise, I will just consider this a $35 loss.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It was a fun game that requires u to have some skill in racing type games. It is fun for all ages.
B00CTT9646|3.0|[[ASIN:B00CTT9646 Star Trek Into Darkness Starfleet Phaser Limited Edition Gift Set (Blu-ray 3D Combo Pack)]]<br /><br />I ordered, and just received, the \\"Star Trek Into Darkness Starfleet Phaser Limited Edition Gift Set (Blu-ray 3D Combo Pack)\\" and had it shipped to Canada as it was not available here. I really like the movie, a four star rating, BUT there were no instructions regarding the poorly constructed Phaser. Does it only \\"swivel\\" as per the website? Does it make any \\"sounds\\" as previously released versions? Who knows? Also as a collector of \\"Limited Edition\\" releases I was surprised that there was no detailed information sheet on the back of this 'large box' release, other than a barcode, letting you know what was inside. Overall, this set only gets a three star rating from me.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|This movie always makes me laugh. You don't need to have read the Odyssey to appreciate this well acted piece of absurdity.
B002RKSZS0|4.0|Classic Jane Austen. A great purchase for the kindle regardless of if you have read it before or not. A must for the digital library.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I really enjoyed the way this book was written. It was done in forms of letters back and forth between people right after World War ll. I'm always fascinated by people's resourcefulness during hard times and these folks did it great. It's a enjoyable read!
0061478784|5.0|The character Sophie in the book is much more alive than in the movie, strong willed, optimistic, witty and kind. Read the words and let the imagination draw you the pictures.
B00DQVST76|4.0|I really loved MDNA live, but sitting in the nosebleeds didn't reveal the experience that the DVD does. Madonna is, quite plainly, the best live act around today, period. (Whether one attributes that to the \\"team\\" or the performer herself is a whole other debate.)<br /><br />Madonna shows are like over-produced experimental theatre, and MDNA is no exception. The show begins dark and violent, seemingly a rejection of Catholicism and traditional social mores, paired with brutal anger over a failed love affair. Armchair shrinks will have a field day picking apart the failed Ritchie marriage, no doubt.<br /><br />The show then moves into a lighter and brighter section, although the pointed critique of Gaga's Born This Way (deserved, as it's flat out melody theft,) seems a bit desperate and pathetic from the freaking Queen of Pop. Nonetheless, Madonna more than proves she \\"still has it\\" as she makes even a stinker like \\"Give Me All Your Lovin'\\" fly and soar with energy. (This section also features \\"Turn Up The Radio\\" which should have been her first MDNA single and the great new song performed at the Super Bowl.) The section ends with what's become something of a staple at Madonna shows: a medly of songs done in a Euro-Gypsy-Folk style that she clearly adores: one can only wait until her remake of Fiddler on the Roof.<br /><br />The show then veers back to a more dark and sexual place, pairing the fun of Vogue with a stripped down Like A Virgin and the utterly heartbreaking Love Spent. It's truly spectacular and vulnerable, something rare from the exceedingly inhuman and biotic Madonna.<br /><br />We then go to a spiritual place, featuring a straight up choir version of Like A Prayer, along with two fantastic, should have been hits from her latest efforts: I'm Addicted and I'm A Sinner. I'm Addicted is flat-out great EDM, and I'm A Sinner is a fun and frothy example of why Madonna's Madonna.<br /><br />The show closes with a high-energy mashup of Celebration and Give It2 Me, with an end line possibly suggesting that the entire show was structured around the idea of a drug trip?<br /><br />In any case, it's great theatre, great music and a live performer in great form, perhaps one or two shades past her prime (see: The Confessions Tour,) but still shaming everyone else out there. Nobody comes close to this level of live brilliance. No one.<br /><br />So, why not a full five stars? I didn't like the over-editing here, where it goes a bit too choppy and \\"Bourne Supremacy\\" for my tastes. I think her last two tours were cut better, offering the energy of the live show while retaining more clarity. That's a half star off. The other half star involves a clear and obvious effort to over-expose the \\"film,\\" to keep the star in long shots or in treated black and white \\"stock,\\" in a feeble attempt to mask Madonna's age. Look, we know you're 55. You're still insanely hot, and I'd suspect you'd look even more hot as an insanely athletic and hot 55 year old versus this facsimile of a \\"girl\\" in lieu of the woman.<br /><br />One more note: casual Madonna fans should probably subtract another half star, as Madonna, to date, isn't a nostalgia act. The show is roughly 20% classics and 80% new material that you may have never heard of.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching Fire is a good transition book. It continues the story and introduce new characters and enough new twists to me keep the reader entertained and hooked so that the reader can only think about and speculate about what will happen next and where the story will go from here. This book does a good job of setting the scene and hunting at the plot of the concluding book of the series without giving to much away. I would recommend this book and the series to others, especially those who like an easy yet entertaining read. I will definitely be reading the third and final installment of the Hunger Games series.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Elementary, in my view, is the best written and best acted TV show ever. The depth and variety of the plot unfolds to a new level in every episode. The casting for this show has been perfect with Johnny Lee Miller as Sherlock and Lucy Lui as Watson. Adrian Quinn and John Michael Hill are a great supporting cast. Every episode challenges the intellect and emotions of the viewer. Having been in recovery and and a fan of Conan Doyle's original Sherlock Holmes myself, I look forward to every new episode on Thursday night with great anticipation. This show is ART in every sense of the word...one of the brightest spots of all TV programming.
B0016KJKIG|2.0|I purchase this sheath from Amazon and was impressed with the pockets and fit of this product.<br />When it wore out from over a year of crawling around in attics I ordered it again and recieved a small molle sheath wihout the pockets.

B00DQVSTCG|5.0|Well, I just got my BR from US, and I am very happy with the sound and image. It is the best concert BR so far. I have a Denon reciever 11.2 170 watts per channelSanyo 70\\"3d and BR Cambridge azur 751 Multichannel,<br />The 1st section is filmed as tarantino's movies but after that, image is so clear and perfect, feels like I would at the golden trangle with a lot of details.<br /><br />It has DTS HD 5.1 MA, if you play it here, you will miss the back up singers , just going to hear the main vocals, on this just Madonna, it is happen with all the rest of concert BR that I have and some of them like one from BOn Jovi, George MIchael and EAgles, sound very awful. So it is normal . But this one fom Madonna is so far better from the rest<br />DTS HD Stereo, if you want to hear all sounds and back uo voclas, play this<br />DTS, just the normal as DVD, sound ok, the other 2 are better<br /><br />Actually all the 3 options sound so perfect for me. The only diference is depend of what kind of sound do you prefer, on my case I do prefer the DTS M 5.1 because I can hear the Madonna's vocals so neat and clear , specially on Masterpiece, LV and LS. It is happen the same with Sticky and the other 20 live concerts that i have, but for me MDNA is better than the rest of my collection.I am so happy with this BR and I am on my way on the 3rd time watchining today and can not get enough....
B00000IZOR|1.0|look for something better. this is pure junk, made in china so plastics are not safe and the cord is too short and thin enough to be unsafe anyway, also arrived with the paint already peeled off in some places!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The characters are wonderful.  You will love the costumes and videography.  I can't wait for season 4!  It was well worth buying!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I keep telling myself I will only watch one episode so I can get a good night's sleep.  Before I know it I've watched three in a row.<br />The writing is great, lots of twists and turns and I like the subtleness of the interplay between Alicia and her husband over his betrayal.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I'm using ipad2 and iPhone 5. You tube app got frozen and unresponsive after switching to another video. Also lost connection and unresponsive all the time. My Sony blueray play better YouTube.<br />Chrome from PC didn't work with sites other than YouTube.<br />Too much troubles and return after 2 days. I used roku, WD, Seagate media players and all did better than this and they are more than 2-3 yrs old.<br />This product is not ready yet or may be only ready with androids devices as my wife's nexus 4 works well with it.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I like watching video's & movies most of my day!!<br />I like looking for music & old t.v. shows!!!!!!!<br />Very old show that I cant fine on t.v.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Good read... I was shocked how it ended..but a good read.. hope there is another one :) HOPE the fourth one goes into more detail :)
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Love this game but some shots get very difficult and paying for items that help to get thru game can get expensive.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This game came as a complete surprise to me. Did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did and would happily pay for more puzzles just like these!
B00DPH7QFM|2.0|I have been a fan of Ritchie since the 70's. The first album I ever purchased was Machine Head, Deep Purple.<br />Ritchie was the main reason I started to follow Purple, Rainbow and now, Blackmore's Night.<br />When I ordered this DVD, I didn't clue in to the fact that it was a recording from 1995, otherwise the purchase would not have happened. Don't get me wrong, Blackers and his fellow musicians are in fine form, Doogie White is a great singer, but having him trying to pull off songs written by, and intended for, the likes of Gillan, Coverdale and in particular, the great Ronnie James Dio, just does not work. I fast forwarded through this DVD to get an idea of what I may have to listen to and watch, it may be a while before I can actually stomach sitting through the whole thing without fast forward.<br />If you're a Ritchie fan, absolutely buy the DVD. If you're a Rainbow fan ..... don't. Buy the 1977 Live in Munich DVD instead. If you don't already own it.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|The stories are the same but the picture is a stunner.  Worth every penny to<br />be able to watch the various episodes and see them as they were meant to look.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I am buying the next one right now!  Heck, I may just go ahead and buy them all!  This series is highly addictive!
B00EEDJHXA|5.0|I have tried many, many different logic games and found most of them either too challenging or not challenging enough. This game is JUST right!!!!
1402766785|5.0|This book is and will always be the greatest life drawing book. Its helped me tremendously in my studies, although this area in art takes lots of time and patience to learn, so don't get frustrated if you don't see results in weeks or even months! So that said this is still a great book, every artist should be required to have this on their shelves!
B009YU9J0E|4.0|Buyer Beware! The Happy Birthday Song is not on this album.  Other than that this is a great album.  4/5 stars.
B005LAII4E|5.0|didn't see it in theaters but, decided to buy it because the first one was great this one picks up where the first one left off and they again did a a great job.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love, Love Love this series! So glad to be able to catch up on my Kindle. Be sure to watch the whole series - first season thru third so that you are ready for Season 4 in January, 2014
B00471JSR4|5.0|Saw it in the theater and it was great great tribute to the cartoon is was based off of. loved it
B00CTT9646|1.0|This is not the review of movie itself (all of movie reviews are purely subjective anyway and are, therefore, useless). This is about the \\"Limited Edition\\" set which includes the phaser replica. I have already seen someone else's photos uploaded for this product here and unfortunately I have same issues with my copy of the included phaser - the phaser \\"tips\\" or \\"nozzles\\" (whatever you prefer to call them) are bent downwards (they are improperly glued into their slots), there are noticeable and visually unappealing gaps between different glued-on parts (like for example between top plastic cover and the rest of the phaser) and the whole thing itself feels like a cheap plastic toy. Which is very unfortunate - the \\"Limited Edition\\" of previous Star Trek movie included a very well-built all-metal statue of Enterprise which was well worth its price.<br /><br />Long story short - if you want to get just a movie, do NOT buy this \\"Limited Edition\\" copy. If you want to get a replica of some movie prop - get it somewhere else, definitely NOT from the company (QMX) which manufactured this phaser replica.<br /><br />Edit: I have also uploaded a couple of my own photos to illustrate the awful build quality.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Battery HD is a handy app to check how much charge is left in the battery and to see when my Kindle is fully charged when plugged in.  The interface is elegant and simple.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Such a great story funny  touching and such great acting and I have recommended it to many of my friends.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Lots of good reflections on the meaning of life. Why are we here?  What should we try to leave behind?  Good philosophy in a nice story. I expected it to be a tear jerker but there was so much humor mixed with the philosophy that it was so much more than a play for emotions.
B001NHNG64|2.0|Reacher could have escaped at any time before reaching Montana; The keystone cops look like geniuses next to the FBI in this book. You can tell by some of the phrases that Child is British trying to sound like an American. I read the first book and it was better-book #2 is just not believable in any way.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|&#34;What to expect when you're expecting&#34; delivered what I expected an okay film.<br />It reminded me of the films &#34;Valentines day&#34; and &#34;New Years Eve&#34;.<br />Same formula .<br />It had a sweetness but lacked a good script.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love this app it stays true to the desktop version.... I just wished I could see my coupon credits.

B000F8O2PG|5.0|great show, great for entire family, kept me very interested, exciting episodes.  recommend to everyone.  you won't be disappointed.  order.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a good old fashioned story and appropriate for young and old.<br /><br />Not only do I enjoy the story but I enjoy the lessons to be learned from it,  Generally still enjoy old-fashioned fiction and also enjoy re-reading those stories I really enjoyed as a child.
B003B02PEU|5.0|I've read a ton of books.  This one warmed my heart......made me laugh out loud....and was reminiscent of my early years.
B0012HEB32|4.0|It was a good series that did not end as expected. There should be more episodes to fully make it great.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|it was good especially MATT somethings you had to really imagine!  Theyoung boys where good actors ddt care for some of the language they had to use.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This will forever stay in my pocket now. I'm ordering 4 more.  One for my survival bag, car, wife, and brother.  We all have and love blades and this little Pocket Pal is one of the best sharpeners I've used so far.  Don't get me wrong, I love me a good stone set.  But as far as something that can fit in your pocket... You can't beat this.  Perfect for flat and serrated edges.  Use the carbide tip first to get the burrs and knicks out of the blade.  Then use the ceramic one to hone it down to almost a razor edge.  With about 10 pulls (5 on each) you can bring new life to any dull blade.  Will not get out BIG dings and will not be super duper sharp but for something so small you can close it in the palm of your hand, it does the trick.  As I said, bought one, ordering 4 more.<br /><br />If you want a REAL sharpener, search amazon for ORVIS SHARPENING SET.  It cost 10 times more than this, but you'll get a lifetime of use and the three stones are all natural and 8&#34; in length.  If you want an amazing stone set, that's it.  If you want an amazing pocket shapener, THIS is it!

B009XY5G80|2.0|Orlando; or, The World's Most Interesting Premise Wasted<br /><br />Virginia Woolf has a wild premise for Orlando: a boy living in Elizabethan England does not die and somewhere near the middle of his life turns into a woman!<br /><br />What a spectacular starting point for an author not only wanting to provide a good story but also wanting to describe the effects of time and gender on a person. Maybe Virginia Woolf did that. Other readers certainly think she did. I do not, however. Orlando is the huge waste of a premise.<br /><br />I'm not sure what I'm supposed to take from this reading experience. Its most salient point was the immutability of the human spirit regardless of sex. For although Orlando must change her outward behavior to align with societal attitudes concerning gender, he/she remains steady throughout the text, mainly through his/her devotion to writing. I suppose I don't find this point really profound. It's been said before and it's been said better.<br /><br />My main problem, though, is the writing. I've read some of Woolf's essays and short stories before and was impressed by her prose. In Orlando her writing choices confused me. Her prose lacks any emotion. I read this entire book utterly dispassionate to what was unfolding on the pages before me. For me, it read cold and surgical. It lacked any life. This detachment is exacerbated by the character of Orlando who is very aloof. Who is Orlando? Why should I care about her? Even when events upset Orlando--when the Russian princess leaves, when the critic insults his poem, when her lands and title are stripped from her--he/she continues on like before. Woolf might say, \\"Orlando was devastated,\\" but not once did I feel any of Orlando's feelings.<br /><br />It reminded me of reading a lab report. \\"Observe closely as our specimen, Orlando, male and aged 16, sits beneath the oak tree. [Six paragraphs of description about his surrounding environment] Now watch as he goes to the Queen's Court [Nine paragraphs of description about his surrounding environment]...Now observe as he transforms into a woman [Sixty two paragraphs about 17th Century London]\\" And on and on.<br /><br />Obviously I'm an outlier here. Most people are moved by Woolf's writing and challenged by Orlando's metamorphosis. My favorite books are those that 1. make me think 2. feature a gripping story. Usually but not always in that order.<br /><br />If I finish a book that accomplishes none of the above, I will be very unhappy. I just finished Orlando and I'm feeling very unhappy.
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|What an amazing album.  Good music to run to or to just chill out to. No doubt a repeated album in my collection.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I pride myself on my cynicism. I pin it like a ribbon on the dark clothes I wear to broadcast my angst. So when it comes to Rainbow Rowell I'm conflicted because she's now written two books--Eleanor & Park and Fangirl--that make me want to dress myself ROYGBIV style while frolicking in a vat of kittens.<br /><br />This is not okay.<br /><br />That is not to say I will stop reading Rainbow Rowell books. Because: why? Why would I deprive myself of her perfectly gooey stories that never descend to shallowness and always leave me joyous? I guess I might just have to admit that for a few hours at least, when consuming a Rainbow Rowell book (consuming being the most apt descriptor: you do not read these books, you consume them like a cake topped with gobs of frosting and innumerable sprinkles), I am more sunshine than dark side of the moon. Yes, I am now an unabashed fan(girl) of Rainbow Rowell.<br /><br />While Eleanor & Park was an intense and internal tale of first love, Fangirl is a brighter, vaster tale of both first love and a bunch of things that happen when you \\"come of age.\\" Cath, a prolific fanfiction writer with social anxiety, goes to college and has to learn to navigate the real world instead of merely retreating to the safety of her fictional and internet-based world. It's probably one of the better depictions of college--and I suppose also, young adultness--that I've read about. There's drunkenness, roommate squabbling, empty nest syndrome, mental health problems, infuriating professors, dining hall conundrums, unintended makeouts, and family drama. These issues elevate the book above a standard romance. But let's be real: I'm mostly here for the looooove and the fangirling.<br /><br />First, the fangirling. Cath doesn't just write fanfiction; she writes Simon Snow fanfiction. In her fic, Simon (picture a scarless Harry Potter) and Baz (imagine Malfoy with a dash of Edward Cullen) are not the enemies they are in the canon series but gay lovers! It's wildlypopular of course. Throughout the book, excerpts from Cath's fanfic and the \\"real\\" Simon Snow series precede chapters about Cath's real life, often cannily mirroring what is happening to her. I have but one request: Rainbow Rowell, write a full version of Cath's Carry On, Simon fanfic and post it to Fanfixx.net, please & thank you. I loved these stories, mostly how they goofily parody Harry Potter. The fangirl aspect itself will be appreciated by anyone who has loved something to the point of obsession. Obsessions are always best when shared with others, and I love how Cath and Company were unabashed nerds about this stuff.<br /><br />And now, the love story. The biggest complaint I can lodge against Ms. RR is her twee writing. Sometimes there are quotes that are cute, yes, but also demand an eyeroll. But I don't much care because these twee statements are said by BFF-worthy characters. Cath and her love interest Levi are nerds but most importantly they're kind. It is simply pleasant to read about decently well-intentioned people trying to figure things out but occasionally screwing up. Their romance is wonderful. It builds slowly--I'm talking Victorian style courtship--but because of its pace, everything between them feels earned. When the culminating moments arrive (and there are more than a few culminating moments; that's the benefit of taking things slow--everything new, even the slightest touch, is a culmination), I was ecstatic. Like I'm-grinning-so-hugely-right-now-I-probably-look-deranged-ecstatic. I just really really like it when two people kiss and it makes them happier.<br /><br />In truth, I am not the type to gush or squee or deem something adorable. But here I am: gushing and squeeing over this positively adorable book.
B00C5R8364|4.0|lots of &#34;real&#34; info on the workings of terrorists groups mingled into the fabric of the story....very interesting and current news worthy of what's really going on in our world today
1250012570|4.0|Eleanor & Park made me want to return to high school.<br /><br />I KNOW.<br /><br />That is an achievement I would have previously believed impossible. But this book made me feel the way I suspect everyone feels falling in love for the first time: giddy and confused; hopeful and anxious. It's so deceptively simple; Rowell alternates between Park and Eleanor's perspectives as they navigate their first intimate relationship, using sparse, poetic language to spotlight their emotions.<br /><br />I read this with a smile crinkling my face. I tried to turn down the corners of my mouth when a character blurted \\"I love you\\" too soon. I tried to dismiss effusive descriptions like \\"Park was the sun\\" as trite. I tried--I tried so hard--to channel my inner cynic, to view this story as standard humdrum teenage romance muck. I failed. I read this story with a smile fixed on my face.<br /><br />From the moment Eleanor and Park fatedly meet on a yellow school bus and commence their relationship, their story is impressively realistic. They start by talking about everything for every hour of every day. That leads to the touching, beginning with accidental nudges and proceeding, slowly so slooooowly, to purposeful brushes of the fingers. By the time they're in love, they barely even recognize it. It's too late for them to wonder if the eventual pain will be worth it.<br /><br />Once the protagonists' hearts are stolen, my excited heart flutters mostly stopped and my anxiety increased because I knew there would be an end to their story; I knew it couldn't stop with them holding hands, reading comics, and laughing together on the bus.<br /><br />I was right. Eleanor and Park capture the sweetness and purity of first love and try to hold it as tightly as they can. They fail. And there is so much beauty in that.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|\\"Leon the Professional\\" what a movie. A young Natalie Portman is amazingly good and Jean Reno is the ultimate cool hitman. What makes it special for me is the presence as director of Luc Besson. I love the films of Luc Besson. La Femme Nikita, another great movie. Did you know though that the hand of Luc Besson is present as writer producer in so many terrific action movies including but not limited to \\"From Paris with Love\\" and the \\"Transporter\\" series. This man makes fabulous wham bam action aplenty movies and when I am in the mood for something that moves along like a runaway train I can't do better than watch one of Luc Besson's films. Leon has everything that makes me love this guy and I can't recommend it highly enough if you want super streamlined action.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|This is the kind of book that you simply read because it is a follow up to the first book.  I really liked that things ended the way that I wanted them to end even if the journey was a hard one along the way.  Emotionally heartbreaking and rooting for the couple the entire way through the book.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Not as good as &#34;Gone Girl&#34; which was a great story. This was too slow and dragging on for me.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book.  I was on a mission to read the 10 books being made into movies this year.  This was one of those books.  I didn't have any expectations and was so pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it.  At the core this is a love story with a heartbreaking twist.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved the book. It was a fast read and you really get attached to the characters, still think about them long after you've finished reading. I already recommended it to family and friends whose feedback was the same, they loved it too.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief is written from the point of view of &#34;Death&#34;.  If you don't know that going in the way it is chopped up would be hard to understand.<br /><br />Having said that, the story is well crafted and the characters are well developed.  It is certainly worth reading!
B009RX85N0|5.0|My kids & i love this show.  Never can have enough bloopers and outtakes though. So more would have been nice.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|This movie was outstanding! It makes your mind think in ways you probably haven't since a child. Its imaginative and gripping and whether your a believer or not it makes you question just what it is that makes an illusion.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I can't figure out what anyone finds to complain about. It is a free game and you can play it without purchasing anything. Of course they offer in game purchases. They do have to make money, after all. You do run out of energy quickly...just as you do in all free games of this type. I'm impressed by how quickly energy is restored. The graphics nor the story line are top notch, but good enough for me considering its free. It's not so easy as to become boring quickly. At least you don't have to beg friends to send you things and wait until three or more people do.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|very well done theme with well written, funny dialogue that will likely appeal to the inner child in all of us. I watched this twice, having not seen it when it was first released. although my children are now grown I think the movie includes helpful themes of good versus evil, diversity and tolerance, heroes and villians and effectively dispels the fears of &#34;monsters under the bed &#34; that many children harbor at a young age. this performance is an absolute joy to experience.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|As a kid, the movie was amazing.  Having a digitally remastered high quality remake of the movie not only brings nostalgia, but also brings a new experience to it's art.  Definitely worth the buy.
B00E00RB5I|2.0|A great music work again by EWF. Love them all. Every song is a pumping soulful encouragement of the heart.
B004WE01YA|5.0|As a kid, the movie was amazing.  Having a digitally remastered high quality remake of the movie not only brings nostalgia, but also brings a new experience to it's art.  Definitely worth the buy.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|200 games for each level seems like too much  100 is plenty to get the idea and see the pattern
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If I could watch only ONE serries for the rest of my life, I would easily pick Downton Abbey. Thank you for showing it on Amazon Prime.
B000E1MTZE|1.0|I got burned.. They said it only played on older DVD players which I have.<br />They lied.<br />They were blank.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Finally something my daughter can watch without me wondering if it's appropriate!  As I am a big fan, I know it's okay for her to see it.  A bonding experience for us.  Love that it's on prime!  KEEP IT THERE!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Great extras and just awesome for film makers on &#34;how to&#34; create new technology. There's some really awesome interview and earth related interviews....
0399255370|5.0|A child learns that not all dinosaurs are green, nor fire engines red when his box of crayons goes on strike and each crayon sends him a letter indicating it is tired of the way he is using them.  Each clever letter brought laughter to my grandson and there was much discussion after the book was read as comprehension dawned that he was free to innovate with color.  (There was also initially a bit of doubt....three-year-olds are rather literal-minded, you know, but an artistic break-through was also made.)
B002ZG980U|4.0|Great movie that bends ones mind.<br />Glad to have in my inventory now.<br />Recommended to anyone for anytime you want to watch it....
B003V5CFV8|5.0|This is a great movie, a classic.  My wife & I enjoyed it on my Kindle Fire with external speakers.  I had forgotten all of the witty lines in the movie...\\"we're in a tight spot, we're in a tight spot\\" as the barn is on fire and they are being shot at with machine guns. Or sitting around the campfire...\\"Gopher\\" with the carcass of a gopher on a stick over the fire and who can forget when Delmar Odonell and Pete Hogwallop get saved...I recommend this to anyone that needs a good laugh.
B008CYDD7I|5.0|While Herbert West - Reanimator is not the best HP Lovecraft story, Reanimator is just about the best Lovecraft movie.  The original short story has just two main characters, so for a feature length movie, the plot has to be padded out, of course.  However, the movie does capture the essence of the book pretty well, and in a fun, scary, gruesome way.  I am not really a comedy movie fan, but in Reanimator the humor works very well and helps to balance out the somewhat disturbing and serious aspects of the story.  The 1980s style, live special effects are very well done and effective.  Much better than the CGI you see these days.  The effects themselves are right up there with Wolfen, American Werewolf in London, etc.  Admittedly no one won an academy award for the acting here, but that hardly matters.  The performances are all pretty good and the movie is enjoyable and worth the reasonable price it goes for these days.  You might want to make sure you are buying the UNRATED version.  There is an edited, R rated version that is a few minutes shorter due to editing.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|Captain America is a very clean movie with strong lead characters who have good values. Easy to watch with the whole family. There were a lot of teaching moments about bullying and how we need to treat others as we would like to be treated.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This is a very addictive series...you will want to watch them all. One of the best sci-fi shows ever made.
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|Meet and get to know the characters of Peter:A darkened Fairytale in this wonderful enriching verse that has brought his characters to life!  O'Brien has a way to bring you into his world, and let you experience the trials and tribulations of his imagination whether in his tales, or his poems!  I especially love the poem, \\"The Gift,\\" and witness the joys of childhood expressed in warmth and companionship.  Another mystical journey, O'Brien has  the craft to bring magic and enchantment to all!
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|As a culmination of a 14 book series, this last entry just didn't quite end on the note that I had hoped.  The pace of the book is fast, far faster than any others in the series in my opinion.  The battles are a mass of confusion, the descriptors are just not good enough to get a real sense that you know what is going on.  Dialogue is about on par with what I saw in the other Sanderson WOT books - the characters do not distinguish themselves from one another.  Another point I found disturbing/annoying was the sarcastic tone taken by the characters.  With the exception of Mat, WOT character haven't ever really had this sense of humor, yet it seems every character in this book all the sudden adopted this attribute.<br /><br />The story itself is okay - it brings a close to the series, which I suppose is better than no closure at all.  If you have read the WOT from the beginning, then pick it up and finish the series.  Unlike many of the other books, I don't expect this one to be re-read much, if at all.
B00785P2QC|2.0|Was hoping it would be more fun. Could never get very far without paying more money. Could be a fun game if they let you play more before you have to upgrade.
B007P3TMW2|5.0|just what i expected having seen the movie i wanted it for my permanent collection looking for the behind the scenes  documentaries
B0088W7VNG|5.0|This is just a really good show to watch. Love the characters and the actors too.The humor in each episode really adds to it's appeal.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Used it for several days.  This morning I couldn't get it to turn off.  All I got was pop up to  upgrade.  UGGGGHHH
B000FA5STS|5.0|I have been reading Baldacci for years but somehow missed this early effort by this master of mystery. Total Control is an absolute page turner. Thank you David!
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|Absolutely loved it.  Really impressed with it.  So realistic.This will be lots of entertainment for everyone.  Good job to whomever wrote it.
1878424777|5.0|FANTASTIC!!! It's on constant rotation in my car!!! Additionally, i downloaded it on my phone and have the book so I'm never without The Four Agreements!
B005K17RU0|5.0|The weather is usually as right on as it can be fot this area but around here the weather is fickle enough that no forecast can be too reliable and accurate.  Maps are great and I like easily navigating to other important (to me) locations to see if friends and family are safe.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|That book is great to read to 3/4 and older grades. It teaches a great lesson about &#34;not judging a book by its cover&#34;. I LOVE this book!
B009PK9SB8|5.0|the product is top quality, excellent care of the store, I recommend it 100%<br />The delivery was fast and secure<br />the flawless operation<br />all excellent<br />so glad I made ​​the purchase
B002DCLQOW|5.0|funny, witty, enjoyable.  Lorelei and Rory captured my heart and I want to know what happens to them and all their Stars Hollow neighbors.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|Loved this movie for years. Awesome Sci- fi flick.If you like a good movie, you'll love this. It's a must see.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Not bad. Story line can be annoying but I'm also 26. Lol. I like the \\"building of the reef\\". Good graphics and vibrant colors.
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|Really not fair to rate a movie like this on the same five star scale you use for &#34;A&#34; movies. This is definitely mediocre  &#34;B&#34; fare. Karl Urban is in fine form with best Stallone mumble and, wow, does he wear that helmet well. He must REALLY like it, he never takes it off. How clever to film virtually the whole movie in one building. To save costs or for art. You decide. Like most &#34;B&#34; movies the plots not too hard to under stand. SPOILER ALERT It basically consists of bad guys trying to kill bad ass cops and vis versa for no reason large enough t warrant the level of apocalyptic mayhem. Don't think about the movie too much. Just get a bag of popcorn, a soda, kick back and let you mind get caught up in the sensless violence. There is no plot to get in your way!
B004XZR63M|5.0|Easy to read. Direct. A slap in the face type of book. This book is a must read for anyone- any age. Stop making excuses and use this book as a guide to free yourself from everyone you work for.
B007EE564U|3.0|This book is well constructed with quite a few twists and turns, the only thing that possibly lets it down is the possibly over simplistic finish<br /><br />The first three quarters were edge of the seat stuff and then it just seemed to have a rushed finale
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I thought this book was unique and very well-written....a view of life as told through the eyes and thoughts of a family's dog.  It is not exactly a &#34;happy&#34; book, but it does have a &#34;happy&#34; ending.  The story is thought provoking too....somewhat philosophical.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This is the best first-person shooter game I have ever played on kindle. The layout is perfect for on the go gamers like me.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As usual he has written another wonderful book.  He is one of my favorite authors and I read anything he writes even the books he wrote for young adults.  Can hardly wait for the next one.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|The research for this story must have been quite a challenge.<br />The same messages are within each of the world's major religions, even some of the symbolism.<br /><br />Great read, lots of fun.
8866135704|5.0|these are the best planners you can keep on you.. love these- makes my life so much easier! thank you
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best series in a long time. Looking forward to Season 4!!!!!!<br />We have watched the first 3 seasons in 2 weeks. We are hooked!
B00A81NFAS|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  Jennifer Lawrence was wonderful as was the rest of the cast.  You will enjoy this movie.
145210655X|5.0|This book contains very apropos humor, especially for Star Wars fans that are new parents with a son. It brought many laughs to me, relating the Star Wars stories to my early years as a parent.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|This is an excellent album.  It won at the Grammys and it deserved to win.  Although played allot on the radio, I wanted to have the song myself.
1451673442|5.0|Excellent read would highly recommend for anyone embarking on a spiritual journey. Clear to understand and the exercises to do are not demanding
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I thought this was a very good movie.  It is well made and the acting was terrific.  A bit gruesome at times, but still to notch.  Highly recommended.
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|This is a fun and easy game to race on my table. It only gives me the free version and that is enough for now. The turns and ins and outs of the tunnels are challenging and maybe someday I will buy more but for now this is all I can handle. My granddaughter plays it easier than me. I like it.
B0052YAKS6|4.0|A very good album that most should enjoy.  I especially like Titanium and Without You, but there are other good tunes as well.  Tks.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|This is the sickest movie ever. A remake with a totally different vibe than the original. Ash doesn't belong in this one. Sit back and enjoy the ride. Ending is a bit of a surprise.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Great movie lots is suspense great story line as always Morgan freemen played a great part def watch this on e
B003O86FMW|4.0|I did not enjoy it as much as the Hunger Games.  I didn't feel that it was exciting as the first book.  However, it was good enough for me to read Mockingjay, as I am right now.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|This was a awesome movie, watched it about 4 times previously and my brother came over, i lent out my copy so ordered it online for him to watch!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham does it again. A fabulous storyteller. He makes me stay up much too late at nights unable to put the book down.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Be sure and buy the Deluxe Edition with the bonus disk as the bonus disk has a great DVD included that will give you even more insight on the man we love and know named Joe Walsh!
B003E6LC6I|4.0|Intrigue, ethical questions, who did it is ongoing, and good acting are some of the reasons to watch this program.
B009C7JS14|5.0|this weather app is amazing it is by far the best weather app that I have ever used 5 stars I love it. must have download Bella in the microwave
B009JZSC9S|5.0|This was a great season. The stories and characters continue to develop and surprise me every episode.  Looking forward to next season.

B005ZC0SYQ|5.0|Excellent movie. Very nice to watch it on my iPad! One of the best movie's I've seen! What a tragedy that Brandon Lee died at such a young age! He was very talented!!
B0017KIBAI|5.0|This device worked exactly how i wanted it to. Mint freaking condition!!!! There were no flaws i could see and can see. I use it at smash tourneys all the time!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This movie was pretty good.  The actors were well chosen, and I think Karl Urban did a terrific job as Dredd.  He has the sneer and voice that I would expect.
B0031RS7X6|3.0|This was a good read. It has a good story line. There are some funny parts, it's probably not as entertaining as some of Sophie Kinsella other books
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Yes, we have very much enjoyed all the &#34;Lark Rise to Candleford&#34; shows. Lots of memorable characters.  A new story in each one.  We were very glad to find them on Amazon.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|Went from easy to impossible, so I gave up and never play it anymore.  Really need to delete it I guess
161655164X|5.0|Great artbook and it met my expectations and some. It also came three days earlier than expected. If you're thinking about buying this book, than I'd highly recommend it
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's a bit twitchy collision detection is off on some areas but otherwise a solid play with the sense of humor from the movies to guide and make you giggle at time just wish it were easier to get tokens in game
B005UG542S|5.0|I love the Harry Potter series. I really enjoyed the books and although I have watched these movies before. I enjoy watching them again with children and grandchildren. They are true to the books.
B001FQMOCA|4.0|My only question is should it be a 5? Very good character actors made this a wonderful watch and rewatching experience.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I like playing Spider Solitaire. The game practically plays itself. Nice game easy to follow. I will be looking for other card games as well.
B004XANKVO|4.0|The one I really wanted was not available so I had to settle with this BAG.<br />I don't like the hard case part at all.<br />But the BAG will serve its purpose.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I love watching action moves. I had to see this one before Reds 2. Great effects and awesome action scenes.
B00005JNJV|5.0|i loved the movie and thought it gave great insight into the story behind the man. christian bale awesome actor!!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Seriously love this book.  Timothy Ferriss' approach to learning rolled into a practical little book about cooking.  Full of brilliant ideas.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I highly recommend this book as it is interesting, thought provoking and hard to put down. I really like Liane's writing style and this was similar to What Alice Forgot in style which I also thoroughly enjoyed. I didn't give 5 stars due to some coincidences in the book that were a little too cliche and not believable causing a few eye rolls. However, I would highly recommend this book!
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Parallel worlds, Leonard Nimoy shows up on the scene. Also appears in various episodes throughout each of the seasons. Illuminati symbolism shows up quite a bit, that for me is a downfall. Other than that. It is quite entertaining.
B00BYM5I1O|4.0|Clark could not write a bad song if he tried.  But these are not his best (with the possible exception of Sis Draper) and his tribute to his late wife was less than I had hoped for
B005F9CPG8|5.0|its a nice addition to my near 400 peice cd collection, only downside is its a cardboard cd holder, but just for the music its a great cd!
B005DOL0R0|5.0|I bought this in hopes that it would fit my 3rd generation Kindle keyboard and it fit beautifully!<br /><br />The overall aesthetic of the design is pleasing. The hand slip latch looks nice as it accents the design but I never used it. I really enjoyed the exterior texture and the natural fit in my hands.  The interior was a pleasant surprise. The soft relief texture really protects against scratches and any accidental bumps and drops<br /><br />Overall, this is a great product and I highly recommend it. If you need a nice sleeve for your 3rd Generation Kindle, this works great even if it's for the Kindle Fire.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Good Game. Each game is very different.<br /><br />I am planning to buy an extension as we are totally 6 players and we can only accommodate only 4 in this.
B0096Y6EUG|5.0|I have been wearing this out since I got it.  The band is absolutely incredible.  The songs are all amazing (with the possible exception of &#34;The Afterlife&#34;).  Plus you get the DVD so you can watch this electrifying performance rather than just listen to it.  One of the best album I have ever heard.
B003L77GGK|4.0|I have all the seasons of Supernatural. I love the show. I love the plot. I LOVE the actors. But nearly every seasons DVD case has arrived damaged! The plastic pieces that hold the different DVDs in place (like the binding on a book, that allows you to flip through the DVDs for the right episode) are always broken. So the DVD cases go everywhere and it makes it hard to close the case correctly. Otherwise it would be a 5 star.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Would love to see this as a movie, with tons of physical and practical effects with just enough CG to keep it otherworldly.
B004YM6JI2|4.0|I have all the seasons of Supernatural. I love the show. I love the plot. I LOVE the actors. But nearly every seasons DVD case has arrived damaged!

B001TMCFFQ|5.0|Get ready to laugh and cry, zoya is one of the best books I've ever read!<br />It is a wonderful book...
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works great to stream stuff from my Android Phone to my tv. I have a bunch of devices for watching web and other content on my tv so I am not going to say this is the one I leave plugged in, but it works great!<br /><br />I would say the one thing that I would want to note is it gets really hot so not sure if that will affect the longevity of it or not. I also can't wait until support for more things are added. When I used it sending any tab from chrome to it didn't work, but I am sure it is in there now.<br /><br />For the price and getting Netflix credit it is well worth getting.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I was skeptical about The Room reviews since I've seen a bunch of good reviews for crappy games before.<br />This game reminded me of one of my most favorite games...Myst! Of course the puzzles are not as complex (nor the game as long) but the graphics, sounds, and logic behind the puzzles are similar. Since I'm now old, I like knowing there is a clue feature if my brain cells wane and I like that I don't need a spiral notebook to keep all the discovered symbols in.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|I've always mistrusted the American devotion to redemption through retributive violence.<br /><br />I don't believe that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is to have a good guy with a gun take him out in slow mo.<br /><br />Then I see the ultimate example of the salvific effects of bloodshed. Two hundred years of torture and rape eradicated by one badass black gunfighter.<br /><br />Django Unchained pits a man who has always been a slave and his only friend, an immigrant outsider, against the institution, slavery, that gave Thomas Jefferson the leisure to write \\"All men are created equal...\\" Slavery made \\"Liberty\\" possible. Django doesn't just shoot down his wife's tormenters, he blows up the American Enlightenment.<br /><br />Slavery and the violence against non-whites that it required are so essential to the character of our country that their residue can still be smelled whenever Birther fulminations against a \\"Kenyan President\\" are heard. I grew up at a time when white people believed they had the right to beat blacks with clubs if they tried to vote. In our time, when a recent poll shows that a majority of my white fellow Americans hold racist views of blacks, I know that this is good as it has ever been for African Americans. Black kids grow up assured that even if they grow up to be president, half of all whites will still not consider them part of the \\"Real America.\\"<br /><br />Django, the slave freed by a German Liberal, is the Siegfried, or Freeman, of the G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung of slavery's gods in this movie. His rescue of his wife, Br&uuml;nnhilde, is incidental to his role as the man who brings down the old white gods who had the power to order the destruction of the bodies of their black slaves. The twilight of these idols comes with the splatter and explosions you'd expect from a Tarantino film, but throws the post-Civil War radical's quandary into sharp relief. Without the inhumane slaughter of those whose violence kept blacks in chains, freedom would always be jealously assailed by whites dispossessed of their fortunes in human flesh. Django and his wife can only escape to freedom if those who enslaved them cannot follow them from the grave.d always be jealously assailed by whites dispossessed of their fortunes in human flesh.

B00B2JSRAS|3.0|Not really all it's cracked up to be, but ok.  Has some good ideas.  Kinda misses the mark though, a little dissapointing.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Modern America only began when slavery died. Lincoln, more than any other popular film ever, puts the old Jeffersonian America of unbridled racism and African American enslavement on display as it endured at the end of the Civil War. The film dispels any nostalgic notion that slavery was due to wither away as reason and benevolence led the (white) American electorate to embrace equality in the mid-19th Century. It was only through the brutal path of human slaughter that non-whites were even allowed to trammel the road to freedom.<br /><br />Lincoln is the finest historical movie I have ever seen. It is cerebral, funny, naturalistic, emotional, and tragic by turns. The script treats viewers as intelligent sharers in a common history that too many of us, actually, are unfamiliar with. By crediting us with knowledge we may not in fact have, the film mimics Lincoln's own project of lifting the commonality of people above their circumstances.<br /><br />Lincoln the scheming politician, the loving father, the inadequate husband, and the American visionary dominates the film. And I say that it is Lincoln who appears as himself, because there is no sign of Daniel Day Lewis in the film. His performance here is the best of his own legendary career.<br /><br />Sally Field also gives her finest performance as Mary Todd. She is a wonderful actress portraying a suffering, wronged, and oppressive woman whom history too often judges only by the criteria of whether she helped her husband enough.<br /><br />The supporting cast should be given a collective Oscar.<br /><br />This film will be used for generations to transmit to young people and new citizens alike the values of modern America and the sacrifice and struggle, and the dying and killing, that were necessary to realize them.<br /><br />TINY NITPICK: Couldn't the film have identified at least one character as an immigrant? A quarter of the soldiers Lincoln meets would have been immigrants, but you wouldn't know it from the film. His secretary John George Nicolay is Lincoln's enabler in the film. He was a German immigrant, but there is no indication of that in his accent or otherwise. A lot of the White House help were Irish, but they were also not in evidence. Oh well!lm.

B00E8KLWB4|4.0|this game is awesome. most hidden picture games you have to buy to play the whole game but this lets you continue to play. its challenging but not so bad that I am forced to buy hints it litterally perfect. the only problem ive had which literally made me want to cry was I had unlocked every room had earned tons of hints and completed most of the challenges and collections and then I turned it on the other day and all the sudden it was all gone and had restarted itself and was back at level won. I don't know what happened but it sucks now I have to start all over.
B00CS65JS2|4.0|Great hit song, the rest are pretty much the exact same beat. But it's still worth checking out for the cross between disco and (I hope this right) techno.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|World War Z was announced and the fanboys staged a s*** show. Never having read the book, I avoided the backlash. This is a good thing. As a horror movie fan, there isn't much more that the audience can ask for from such a flick. The ending is rushed and comes to a premature halt, but we should be willing to let that slide. This is the start of a trilogy, of course! How many times do we get to see Brad Pitt lead such a blockbuster effort, especially of this type, nonetheless? Not many... Seven, Interview With A Vampire... That's it.<br /><br />World War Z borrows from many other genre films before it, but the influence of George Romero was most evident. Many scenes bare similarity with Day of the Dead, an oft-forgotten entry in Romero's \\"Dead\\" franchise. The beginning shares the white-knuckle suspense of Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake, and then moves onto 28 Days territory. The zombies here are unique in that their behavior is not humanoid, instead they act like ants, climbing and swarming all over themselves in order to overcome obstacles. They move super fast, and frequently throw their entire bodies at their victims, descending on them like bloodthirsty flying squirrels. The global scale of the epidemic is evident, though not as much as some viewers would like. Keep in mind that this is not Contagion. If the film was made to the exact specs of the book, it could have ended up the disjointed mess that was that Matt Damon flunker.<br /><br />Brad Pitt does not play an invincible killing machine. He is UN, so he is much more cool and diplomatic. The Unrated version is very action-packed from beginning to end. Brad Pitt shifts from focusing on his family's safety to focusing on the larger issue of how to stop the outbreak. His character shows what a cool head can accomplish in the instance of global disaster. The third act is more of a one-on-one showdown instead of the epic climax everyone had been hoping for, but overall the movie does a good job of bringing some novel ideas to the big screen. A great addition to zombie movie canon, a slap in the face to all fanboy haters.some novel ideas to the big screen. A great addition to zombie movie canon, a slap in the face to all fanboy haters.

140006922X|4.0|Sad to see all the negative comments on something that no one really knows or understands. Remember faith is faith and opinion is opinion. this book blends both. Responses by \\"would be\\" authors that take 5 minutes to read are very tedious, so please learn how to comment.

No matter your career, Gary Keller's advice will help you bring your business and even personal life to the next level. I highly recommend this book.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Horrifying childhood. Gives a peak into a very closed country. It's worth reading and makes the problems we face insignificant.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The story follows three women and their lives in Australia. Their lives are so intertwined and connected which makes it hard to stop reading. Definitely a good read that will have you thinking about your own life and the decisions you make every day.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|I'm liking this game so far. It's a nice time killer and the touch controls are some of the smoothest I've messed with so far.
B00DQVSTCG|2.0|i was hoping it was just a few bad copies but i have both the blu ray and the dvd and both have sound issues.  The video quality is fine. The whole show has a filtered effect which i think is why people don't think the video quality is good...its supposed to look like that.  however the 5.1 sound is messed up. the front right and rear right speakers play nothing.  the stereo mix works but when you hear how good it is in 5.1 (well, more like 3.0, lol), it really starts to bug that you can't listen to it in full surround sound.<br />i was hoping maybe the DVD would be better and i would just suffer with bad video quality, but the surround sound doesnt work on there either.<br /><br />hopefully Interscope will see that this is a huge fail and re-manufacturer it. in the meantime, save your money until this is reissued.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: this is only a review of the quality of the blu ray, not the content itself.
B004LWZW24|4.0|I have never heard of this movie until we went go go see The Conjuring,  the trailer for Insidious 2 was too good to miss it. So then the search was on for chapter one! Very reasonably priced, superfast delivery! Thank you!

0688014291|4.0|I enjoy Blanchard's way of telling a story to communicate another business idea and practice.  It's a quick read and you understand what he's doing right away.  The One Minute Manager seems a bit hokey at first but many of its recommendations I can see how they'd work and I plan to incorporate most of it in one way or another.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|the book started off fairly slow however the interest builds when you recognize the patterns of this mental illness. Now I have a deeper insight to the constant pain in which many people experience.

I would recommend this product to anyone looking to convert their old slide collection to digital.

B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game reminds me a lot of the Diablo Games. An the fact that its for the Kindle Fire is just that much better. An its free!
B002RI9PKO|5.0|This book challenges the idea one have to be gifted to succeed and shows different perspectives of known success stories. There are much more than talent involved on those stories. The environment, the timing, the willingness to thrive with right attitude and hardworking seems to be much more important than the talent. Worth reading, well done Gladwell!<br />Evaldo
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|This CD arrived as expected. It was everything I expected!! I listen to it often and have friends that purchased cd too.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was originally recommended to me by my 27 year old son. He loved it, and the sequels.  It took me over a year to act on his recommendation but now I know what all the hoopla was about! An original story with terrific, memorable characters.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Can not help but love these characters, flaws and all! Yes there are a lot of sex scenes, but the relationship between them is amazing!

B0012QTT4O|5.0|Breaking Bad from the perspective of just telling a story, is the greatest TV series ever, it is a must watch. Don't start in the middle, it's like a book, you must start at the first page to get all the wonderful nuance of it.<br />Don't be fooled this is not a TV series; it is a movie near a hundred hours long. It started as a TV series, there was a theme; Walter White a High School chemistry teacher, diagnosed with cancer starts cooking meth.  All the characters are assembled and developed into the theme, a concept. However what comes out is a well plotted story where there is a beginning and there is an end, and what is between is the journey between the two.<br />More TV should be like this.

159463176X|4.0|Very good book but I had to make a list  of characters to be able to know the connections between them.  So many middle eastern names that it was a bit confusing but the outline helped.<br /><br />I have not read the others yet.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Great documentary about the history of Sound City recording studio. Music is excellent, of course, and the history of the studio and of the artists that recorded there is super interesting. Loved it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So many interesting characters an situations. Getting to know them all is like getting away from your life for a while. They've done such a wonderful job on the costumes and the scenery and sets. Just beautiful! I love it!
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|Slightly annoyed that the magic in the film was obviously created with CG. Action packed. However it did lag in the middle quite a bit. It's funny they market the movie like the magicians are the main characters. When really the relationships around them are the real story. It was decent. Definately better than the other recent magician move Burt Wonderstone, lol.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet. This is the best USB 3.0 hub for the money Q3 and Q4 2013. If you're at all considering this product, get it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Build Quality<br />Actual USB 3.0 Speeds<br />All ports fully wired for charging<br />Fairly long cable<br />Nice, simplistic packaging<br />Anker has FANTASTIC customer service, so if there are any problems, they will do the best they can to fix the problem.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The hub itself is fairly lightweight and is easily moved by the rigid cord.<br />It's sort of big for a USB hub<br />The port positioning can be a bit awkward as they are all fairly close together on the top of the unit.
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|Absolutely great movie, super energetic, really fun to watch and gorgeously animated. Can be a little adult but nothing hard to handle and I wouldn't even say hide it from the kids. Overall just really a lot of fun. 10/10!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I study at MIT, and this device did not get past the setup stage.  It seems that the device is incompatible with the routers at MIT, and that I will have to wait until I graduate before I can use the chromecast device.  What a waste of money.

B008EKOIN8|2.0|Michaels other books (the first food trilogy) are strong and tight. As usual, this book is granular in detail, but sadly, he doesn't have much to say here. Talk about beating a dead horse.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Love the challenge but the white background is very bright on the light blue ball line to aim is difficult to see but otherwise very addicting game
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Great Cast and doesn't get tired like many series do after several seasons.  I like the stories and the more real life type situations.  No heroes and no magical turn of events.  Rather it reveals people more realistically, some with more flaws than others.  I also like the perspectives in generational differences.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|THIS WAS GREAT. IT IS A SET-U FOR THE REST OF THE SERIES IN WHICH  IT INTRODUCES THE CHARACTERS. I HAVE ALSO WATCHED THE SECOND AND THIRD EPISODES AND IT IS SO REALISTIC. WONDERFUL ACTING.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I spend years between books waiting to travel with Neil Gaiman again, part of me fearful the next journey won't be as amazing as the last--even as I know such fears are utterly ridiculous and unfounded. He has never disappointed me, not once.<br /><br />Every journey with Neil Gaiman is unforgettable, from the moment you crack open the book, until you sigh with lament as you close it on the last page. The Ocean at the End of the Lane was exactly what I wanted it to be: thrilling, heart-wrenching, touching and so real that for a moment after finishing I actually had to pinch myself to see if I was really back. *Review also posted at Goodreads.com
B000ICKPOQ|4.0|The visual effects in this show are gorgeous.  It's like a travel promotion enticing you to visit Atlantis.  Most of the characters are good and there are some interesting plot twists, also, of a Sci Fi sort -- and I'm a Science Fiction fan.  The &#34;Wraith&#34; as an arch enemy are getting a little tiresome.  As when I was watching the Stargate series, while highly entertained, I sometimes wished for a plot that did not include a life or death situation and multiple fire fights.  At times I feel like I'm watching a video game.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|One of the things I absolutely adore about Liane Moriarty's books is that she gets inside these people and isn't afraid to expose their deepest, most intimate thoughts. The things that go through our heads, the ones we know would shock the people around us if they were to ever hear them spoken aloud... she goes there sometimes, and it's gripping and tragic and so true it makes you take a step back and close your eyes and just breathe for a moment. And then you close the book, and you look at the people around you and wonder about their little secrets and know deep down there are things about the people you think you know, the people you love with all your heart, that you probably couldn't handle knowing the truth about. An excellent read, this book!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|First of all, I am no fan of Tom Cruise, he never has the decency of dying in a movie. I also think he is not much of an actor.<br />But somehow, in this movie, I liked his caracter, and he was quite likeable.<br />The story is not too deep, and easy to follow. A bit of a twist, and if they would have left out the last minute, a good ending.<br />I think the worst actor goes to olga. Not impressed with her acting.
1616551607|5.0|Got this as a birthday gift for my gf and she loved it! We are both huge fans of the series and of Amano and this has lots of amazing pages and art.
0345803507|3.0|A bit over rated, but it's still a fun summer read. If you like romance novels or a fun, girly read.
B000IZ8SD8|4.0|When I want to veg I like a movie that is pure entertainment. This certainly meets that criteria. Not too much action, visual effects were pleasing and the hippie rocket man back on earth was foolishly endearing.
B003L77G06|5.0|My parents love this show! It's a great gift for family or friends. I would highly recommend it if you like comedy.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|It does charge the kindle better but still doesn't keep the port from messing up. Better quality than the charger the kindle came with.
B006RXQ8RI|4.0|This is definitely a classic... I didn't know how easy is to watch movies in amazon. I will see this film again.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I had wondered for some time how Teacher had left the army. This is a well written novel describing it. As always a great light read. Perfect for the tube, metro, etc

B003CBTVNG|5.0|I laughed at this until I cried. However, its not for kids. Perhaps my humor is a bit lame, but the story has an endearing kind of charm.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|This was a good book.  Some parts were a little slow, but over all it was entertaining and enlightening.  I still struggle with trying to understand the devastation in the character's story.  It's very sad.
B004N7WJF0|5.0|A great look at the band unplugged, very well done ! A must for any Scorpions fan, only draw back was their signature classis song &#34; No one like you &#34; was not part of the set.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Not only was it a delight to hear all of the first-hand stories from famous musicians, David Grohl does a great job of capturing the energy and creativity of the industry 'back in the day'. There is a sense of a soul that has been lost since the democratization (or digitization) of music recording. The final quarter of the film which features the artist collaborating on new music is fascinating. The album has been somewhat panned for not having a singular voice, but I love the stories behind these collaborations.  I hope to see more from David Grohl as the purveyor of good-old-fashioned music that is less about what can be fixed in post production, but what musicians can create when they spend hours of painstaking practice in a studio.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So fun great fantastic I love it so wonderful  fun fun fun great yay wohoo yeah fun play blah fill in this box
B0061S073A|5.0|Great app for parental controls and to make playing easy for children.  The ability to block purchases and internet makes it a must
055338466X|5.0|Stevan Hawkingathis best. He describes quantum physics in moreor less layman's terms and makes the delimas faced by quantum physicists understandable by all. He may have some strange ideas about black holes but he haas a firm grasp of physics today...
B005544TRQ|5.0|Well maybe some corporate lawyers did, but I certainly wouldn't have thought that would be the case.  Though the premise is perhaps a bit far fetched, the plot is compelling and the setting has a feeling of authenticity, at least to a coporate law outsider such as myself.  The characters are interesting and storylines are surprisingly exciting for how little action there is.
B003G4W49C|5.0|His writing brings you into the story immediately Anne never lets go. The way the plot is set up is mind blowing and it hangs with you for a while when you finish.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is one of the best book I've read I a long time.  I read it over a year ago and I still think about it! You literally can't put this book down, so only read it when you have some time to invest or you will be going nuts waiting to see what happens next.
B008FPOIT6|2.0|While the starting idea is in itself interesting, it is developed very bluntly and with quite an amount of unnecessary details - characters keep talking about technology as it were some kind of fetish in itself. More Dan Brown than Umberto Eco, by all means, in spite of the bookishness and the geekiness of it all.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|This is a worthy follow-up to \\"Operation Armada.\\"  \\"Operation Parsifal\\" is like the big budget sequel -- with the hero growing into bigger responsibilities; with raised stakes, and more exotic locales.<br /><br />\\"Operation Parsifal\\" is set in the waning days of World War II and presents an interesting scenario where the hero has to try to SAVE Hitler's life.  Crazy, huh?  Trust me, you'll want to find out exactly why he has to save the horrible dictator's life!<br /><br />This book is like a James Bond story set within a historical reality.  Readers who enjoy historical thrillers will love this book.  I recommend it!
B008U3NU38|5.0|I preordered it about a week before it was released, and was drooling all over waiting for it to come. Boy was it worth paying for the 2 day shipping.<br /><br />The look of the box is wonderful. It was extremely detailed, and surprisingly sturdy. It almost looks like a real boombox at times (I actually tried to pull up the antennae on the top).<br /><br />Inside is also really nice. The digipacks are neatly arranged for easy accessibility, and feature brilliantly high quality artwork on them. I thought they would have gone for replica vinyl digipacks like the Singles box set and the new album only release, but these are much higher quality, and contain the same artwork. The albums are also snapped into place for some stability (Sandinista! and the 3 bonus disk each have one in a slip though). The inside is ok (I would have put a bunch of photos in, &agrave; la the Bealtes 2009 releases, but that's just me), but thankfully the extras and dvd cases each have a mini booklet that gives some information on the band. I really love the little posters with the lyrics on them. The one for Sandinista! has some fun artwork on it, Combat Rock's has a photo on the band on the backside, and London Calling has several photos on it.<br /><br />The magazines are also really nice, and super high quality. It's made of very thick paper, and feels really heavy actually. The photos in them make up for the lack of ones in the albums too. It's fun reading them since they are basically historical documents. The special edition one contains testimonials from the band (except Terry) and several friends that really give a bit of insight into the history of the band and the opinions of the set.<br /><br />The stickers are really neat, and I'm probably going to scan them so I can save the ones from the set. The dogtags are also a nice little addition. I'm not quite sure what to think of \\"The Future is Unwritten\\" yet. It's a little blank book that's more symbolic than functional. The giant poster in the cigarette container is really nice, and if I wasn't so keen on keeping it pristine it would be up on my wall by now.<br /><br />The music:<br /><br />Mick has been harping on about the improvements made to the sound quality for a while, and he wasn't kidding. You really do notice more details compared to the previous remasterings. I did a quick comparison to the old remasterings (which I admittedly just torrented), and noticed a huge difference in clarity, depth, warmth, and bass. If you have the Singles box, they sound nearly identical (I played both version of \\"London Calling\\" and couldn't tell the difference). I read a review that said they manage to get vinyl sound out of the CDs, and I have to say that this is true. There is virtually no compression, so you get a really good dynamic range. The music isn't even louder than the previous remasterings. They're the same volume, but here everything is so much more pronounced.<br /><br />If an award for best remastering of an old album were to be released, the 2013 Clash remasters would best even Deutsche Grammophon's and Decca's acclaimed 24-bit/96-kHz remasters.<br /><br />The early and live material is really fun too. It shows how great the band were in their element. It's also fun hearing how different they were when they started versus their more famous period.<br /><br />Despite the mammoth amount of material, there is still some stuff that is missing. I do not just mean the Vanilla Tapes (superfluous) or Cut the Crap (out of this bo xset), but a few random songs as well. They include \\"Justice Tonight,\\" \\"Kick It Over\\" (both rather boring \\"Armagideon Time\\" remixes), the superior single versions of \\"The Magnificent Seven,\\" the abridged \\"Magnificent Dance,\\" \\"Outside Broadcast,\\" \\"Radio 5,\\" and \\"Mustapha Dance.\\" I'm not entirely missing them (except the Seven remixes and Mustapha Dance), but they are all available in the Singles Box.<br /><br />I also wish \\"From Here to Eternity\\" and \\"Live At Shea Stadium\\" were included because they are both absolutely fantastic albums.<br /><br />DVD<br /><br />The material here includes several live performances, their promo films, archive of material recorded throughout various times, and the film \\"Clash on Broadway.\\" Overall it's pretty interesting, and it's fun seeing the band perform live. They're completely in their element and is a real treat for those of us who could never have seen them live.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a Clash fan, definitely get this. It is worth every penny, and an excellent addition.<br /><br />If you want to save money, however, I would get the new 5 album box and the Singles Box (both with replica vinyl packaging). You'll get the exact same stuff (minus the tiny amount of material exclusive to both), for a lot less.<br /><br />Note: I read two reviews that state that the discs are not playing. I'm using my computer, but I tried my external drive and my old computer's drive, and they play perfectly fine. The Singles Box set also features the same design of the black vinyl, and that plays perfectly fine. I cannot explain why other people's do not work.cluded because they are both absolutely fantastic albums.<br /><br />DVD<br /><br />The material here includes several live performances, their promo films, archive of material recorded throughout various times, and the film \\"Clash on Broadway.\\" Overall it's pretty interesting, and it's fun seeing the band perform live.

B00CDUVDEC|5.0|It's been a while since I've wanted to listen to anything from Phil (formerly Pantera frontman). I thought I'd give this album a shot and did it ever pay off!  This is the most ground up metal I've heard. It seems Phil went from Heavy Metal to Death Metal with this album. I am impressed that Phil keeps going and going. He seems like the freaking Energizer bunny. I would highly recommend this album to any true Pantera fan. I may have to check out some of Phil's other stuff.
0307719774|5.0|I've owned this journal for about 2 months, and I never tire of writing the daily entries.  I like that I can answer fairly quickly, briefly - yet concise enough to make it interesting to read back on.  The prompts are often thought-provoking, especially when you contemplate what your answer to the same question might be a year from now ... or 5 years from now.  I actually have a leather journal cover that I have inserted this book into.  It fits perfectly, and has a nicer (and simpler) appearance.  Love the idea behind this.  And if you don't have time to do an extended journal or diary entry on a daily basis, this is for you.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|I love this movie . This is my second copy . Beautifully done , great acting and very colorful . Everyone should watch at least once.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|If you are in the mood for an entertaining and amusing action flick this is for you.  Don't expect a deep drama.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|WHAT A WONDERFUL GROUP OF SONGS.  WHAT HAVE I BEEN MISSING, LISTENING TO POP/ROCK WHEN HE'S BEEN HERE ALL ALONG.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I really received a lot of valuable insights from this book. Great marketing concepts for those trying to sell their novels.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Sci fi enthusiasts, this is a must see!  Love the story line and good character selection by the producers. Woot. More seasons please
B008469DGY|4.0|I ok but i am hung on a level that i can not get through.  I keep playing until i get through.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Must install. Cleans your kindle real good! 5 stars fo sho! Don't know what else to say, keeps your kindle in good shape.
0439023521|4.0|I read the author's earlier \\"Gregor\\" series, lent to me by a<br />then-nine-year old, and heard a lot about this series and the movie. I<br />finally read The Hunger Games, and immediately ordered the next book.<br />I love the realistic way the author handles poverty, without<br />idealizing it or making it seem unusual.  It's just the way things<br />are.  The central premise reminds me of Shirley Jackson's \\"The<br />Lottery\\", without the immediate gratification.  Instead we get an only<br />slightly more extreme version of \\"Survivor\\", reality TV where the<br />participants must kill each other and survive dangerous elements<br />thrown at them by producers.  I wasn't overly fond of the the main<br />protagonist, Katniss, a young but very cranky girl, and her partner<br />seemed a bit bland.  The book got a bit bogged down in the late stages<br />of the competition.  But it was an easy, if painful, read.  I'm glad I<br />didn't read it when I was a kid.  It's no Harry Potter, but it is<br />interesting and reflects on a lot of modern culture.
B0031KC8OC|5.0|I love this series so far!!! I like how easy to was to purchase and then instantly watch! I might be purchasing the other season too.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|I found the movie to be quite good, different from the stage version, of course...it is a movie. I have trouble comprehending why anyone would expect one form of media to duplicate any other form. Books, stage shows, movies, tv productions...any format will be different than any of the others. Any adaptation of a story will vary, not only because of the format, but also the vision of those involved in the implementation. It seems that, if one is open to a different view, a different presentation, other aspects of the story can be appreciated. When experiencing a different version than the one you are used to, you may find some details that you missed before, maybe even completely different perceptions of the same events within the story. There seems to be an almost snobbish feeling to many of the negative reviews, as if to say that the stage play is the only way that someone could possibly get the 'real' Les Miserables. It might be good to recall that the book was written in the 1860s and widely acclaimed as one of the greatest works of it's time. Strangely enough, one sees little or no complaint that the movie doesn't live up to the book. Hmmmm. I am purchasing from Amazon so that I can watch it again, play it in the background for the music, and have the fun of spotting things each time that I may have missed previously. I hope folks will give this movie a shot, the majority of folks seem to appreciate it for what it is...a movie, with excellent music throughout.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|a movie that you need to be in a somber mood to watch, but it's really an amazing movie that moves and keeps you engaged. There are some hard truths in our recent history. These truths need to be conveyed to the next generation and we want to always remember the horror of what was the Holocaust.<br />The DVD looks good in BlueRay. Of course the movie is (mostly) black and white, so the Blue Ray really serves best with the extras and bonus material, of which I have yet to fully view.
B006ZAZ31U|4.0|I read this, not for pleasure, but to find out more about what is really going on there.  I certainly achieved that.  The book is well-written and very informative.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I really was lost most of the movie but was amazed at the special effects and the different characters that the actors could be.  I'd say &#34;oh my goodness I can't believe that's _________!&#34;  Ingenious for sure .
B0093QHWLC|5.0|Great movie, great acting.  Sean Penn was great, as usual.  The story line of childhood friends and staying in the neighborhood as they got older was familiar.  It will likely resonate with a lot of people.
B001974DG0|5.0|This book was awesome! I could not put it down! I was &#34;in&#34; from page one and was not disappointed for one minute!
B002ZG9846|5.0|I really like this movie, show what can be done, with all these criminals and gangs, teacher kids karate and jujitsu. Without training the kids will be took over by gangs. With the right training the kids will get rid of the games.
B00D6SBOWG|1.0|Would not purchase, after 3 tries trying to download it I deleted it from my game.  They should let  you know it will not work on a Kindle Fire.
B0000DJE9R|3.0|One of his good CD got a downtime in the mail, it was package good and Anna had a couple good songs on it. I like Marvin Gaye and Lionel Richie  better.
B00F2NOPFG|3.0|The good news is that this is a nice version of the movie.  The replica starship is made by Hot Wheels and comes with the same stand they have used for all their die-cast ships.  Much larger than a standard hot wheels car, I was glad to add this to my collection.<br /><br />Also, the steelbook looks very nice, and I like the alternate cover art.  However, I was disappointed there was no version of the steelbook that included the 3-d blu-ray, so I actually bought this movie twice, one to get this version the other for the 3-D version.  But the 2D blu-ray looks spectacular as well, looks very sharp in 1080p.<br /><br />My biggest problem is the sparse bonus features on the blu-ray version, and the reason why they are sparse is because they have been split up for other retailers to use as exclusives.  If you get this movie at Target, theres a whole extra disc of bonus content not on this version.<br /><br />But even than, there's no movie commentary track.  To get that you are required to get the itunes version, which is the only one to have the commentary track.  I don't use apple products, but if I want to listen to commentary, I am required to download itunes and purchase the movie there (or at least use my digital code on itunes instead of ultraviolet).<br /><br />Its a great movie and I love this package, but I am disappointed at Paramount for splitting all the bonus features in this manner instead of just letting us paying customers choose where we want to buy.
B00C5R8364|5.0|I don't usually like war-like books, but this is both &#34;genius&#34; and incredibly informative.  I learned more than I ever wanted to know, but feel richer for knowing and I've been recommending the book to friends and family.
0307341550|5.0|I am a huge fan of Gillian Flynn. I read this book after reading her other two books and was just as impressed. I love the author's style of changing the point of view. One of those books I just could not put down!
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I finally have words to express the &#34;awkwardness&#34; I sometimes feel when surrounded by extroverts.  I guess this is probably how left-handed people feel in a predominately right-handed world...nothing wrong with it, it's just different. :)
B003Q6D27S|5.0|this had a great ending for the last film ni the series, was a thrilling conclusion to what is a unique horror genre.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Why pre order movies before they come out? Don't be fooled by thinking you will see the movie any faster than ordering it the day after its released, unless you already plan on spending more $$$ for it. I sure didn't save on time because 3 days after the movie came out Amazon hasn't shipped it. Think I would have got better service if I had waited till it came out then ordered it. I could have just walked in Wal-Mart and bought it or watched it on paid preview and seen it earlier. Thank you Amazon for making it clear that if I DONT PAY MORE for a pre order release then no way I'm getting it earlier even if my order is over $25.OO. Super saver shipping means that they ship when they feel like it even if you ordered it 3 months in advance.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|I liked this movie it was a little slow in the beginning but more interesting near the middle of the film The acting was OK but I've seen better from Tom Cruise
B008I43DYU|5.0|This is a wonderful option to have on my I Pad. It is nice to have it at your finger tips when you need it!!!
0743277708|5.0|Amazing story. This is our favorite book for school.  It is so much fun to read and the story line is captivating.
B0093QHWLC|5.0|Sean Penn was intense, great supporting cast. KB was great as always. Great movie by Clint Eastwood, two thumbs up.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|love mystery ; solving puzzles; figuring things out. like playing it just for fun but wouldn't t spend my own money on it!

B00BWBHIUG|4.0|the images are very nice and clear. the idea of &#34;having&#34; a real reef is so cool for the children. adults can have a good time as well and share it with the Little ones as i do with my son.<br /><br />i my self have started to understand more about how life takes place in such a wonderful enviroment<br /><br />i would only wish pearls were a bit easier to get and they were not sold (i mean real Exchange dollars for pearls)
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I am a 40 year old casual gamer and thought I would try some games out on my kindle.<br />Samurai vs Zombies is the best game I have played on the kindle.  I have probably put about 40 hours of game time into before I got to a level I could not beat.  Nice thing is that you can choose different weapons / attributes for your character which gives you choices on how best to beat the zombies.  Game is challenging despite the simple idea of go forward kill zombies and keep them from getting to the home base.  Age group 11 to adults, graphics better than average, playability strong.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun to play.easy to play.  Like the game.  Don't always have a great deal with the game, but that's what the game is about.  Chances
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|No character development, all of the magic feels like a camera trick, mediocre acting. Could have been a great movie but just poorly executed.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I will recomend this to any one this is a great game<br />I got this game just to play so its kinda like a small version of sim city
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I love British period dramas.  This has everything you need all in one, romance, thrills, action, great villains. The story is very well written and the characters are endearing.  I can't wait for next season.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Great App. Keeps track of my 5 favorite places.<br />Like the graphics a lot.<br />Works very well once you get it set up.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|It was excellent and I really learned that i should watch what I say and how I treat others because one simple mistake or rude comment could change there life forever
B0043D2FB2|1.0|I bought this book when it first came out and treasure it. Then, I bought the Kindle version for travel, and want to point out that while the content is the same, there is NO actual index, but just a listing of topics with no links, no location or page numbers. This makes this book useless for any purpose except reading whole chapters, and far inferior to the print edition. Buyer beware! It looks like this applies to the huge Bhikkhu Bodhi full-length sutta translations as well, which is even more of an issue. Hopefully Wisdom will get this fixed.
0385732554|4.0|The book was in good shape.  It took a little longer than I had anticipated to receive it, but I was happy with the product I received.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|A fun, what if scenario of a little town that has all the geniuses in the world in one place. A great set of characters, constantly thrown into one life-threatening situation after another caused by their own 'pushing to the limits' the scientific world.  Very much like 'Warehouse 13' and  'Fringe'.
B00DNDR29I|5.0|So um...doubt Cindi Mayweather will ever personally read this but let me say....this album...is the MOST cohesive album I've had the pleasure of enjoying all year and I just had to say it to someone. No, no, I don't think you understand. I don't facebook, I don't twitter, Ioun do none of that space agin for real BUT I just spent 20 minutes figuring out how to navigate around my company's firewall so that I could stick my head into the outside world and yell out: THIS ALBUM IS FREAKING RIDICULOUSLY GOOD!! Like I would slap my mama but Ioun think Janelle would approve(or my mom for that matter). JANELLE, PRINCE, SPALDING AND SOLANGE? \\"Come ON MANNNN\\" This album makes me so happy I could put on a football helmet and dive off table into a pile of bean bags while wearing a diaper and some other insanely outrageous thing that outside of the context of extreme joy would make me a little scary......anyway......WELL DONE!! BLESS YOU CHILD BLESSSSSSS YOU!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great great great. Great acting. Great story. Great period setting. Part drama, part historical documentary.<br />It did have a few &#34;twists&#34; that were a bit too dramatic but well done nonetheless.
B0035JNTA6|1.0|sadly a stupid and insipid plot line with actors who are supposed to be stunningly handsome and are obviously pretty sad in the looks dept. Perhaps the director planned that but it was hard to watch. I tolerated it for 15 min and shut it down.  the poorly written and unfortunately weirdly acted movie is &#34;A MUST MISS&#34;.<br /><br />Barbra
B00EE3FTNM|3.0|Good show but takes a couple episodes to get going. The first episode does enough to keep you watching the series but it wasn't great.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|The plot is a bit odd but the acting and the filming is better than some 2013 flix. You can't afford to miss this one but then compare it to todays output of the Hollywood moguls and you will cry.
B008MM9630|4.0|Free. Fun. Nothing more to say. The fantasy aspect makes the game more interesting than regular farm type games.  Plant and harvest things like pumpkin pie plants.

0385486804|1.0|I thought this was one of the most boring books I have ever read.  I wouldn't even have finished it, if it wasn't required by our book club.  It was so repetitious!!  Also, it was so obvious that this young man had a mental disorder of some kine - but that possibility was never even talked about.  I don't believe in making heroes out of such self indulgent people such as this.  He didn't care about anybody except himself ------ again - probably Bi-Polar or something like that.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Whether you're a man, woman, jock, or nerd, you're bound to fall in love within the first 10 pages. George R.R. Martin has revived my love for books and reading. I have recommended this series to everyone who knows me and have convinced several of my friends to read these books after telling them about the story.<br /><br />As for the book's storyline, I absolutely loved it. It was so seat clenching and jaw dropping that was paralleled to watching the series finale of an awesome tv show or an episode of breaking bad.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|This is my first reading for the author and I had a good impression.<br />The author was able to describe the magic system and the characters in a good way. The development of the main character was interesting and intellegent. I only wish that it talked more about the magic system.<br />The novella is brilliant, and I feel it deserves 4/5
1577314808|5.0|Don't read a summary. Just read this book. Let go of all your judgement and let your mind observe and experience his philosophies.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I really enjoy this series.  Well done!  Can't wait for the next season.  Season one was great and season two did not disappoint.

Once I recieved my new cassette, I popped it on, oiled it, and it shaves like a brand new razor.<br /><br />To those that gave a poor review because it didn't fit your razor. Remember to look under your trimmer, it usually will tell you what replacement cassette or head you need.

B00D3NSDVO|5.0|I'll start by saying this isn't the type of book  I usually read, I bought it for my Dad, but I decided to read it too, and I am SO glad I did ! I'm not a spy thriller kind of gal, I usually stick to forensic or serial killers, murder mysteries, etc, but this book seems to cross the divide in a lot of ways. Sure it IS a spy story, and everything that goes along with that is in the book, deep government agents & agency's, things that surpass reality, but we let it go, as if its good enough for 007 it's good enough for this book ! The story is modern, relentless, well told, and impossible to put down, I've had maybe 8 hours sleep in 2 days ! I loved it, and cannot wait for the sequel to come out, I'm sure there must be one, and I'll be preordering it ! Thanks for a fantastic non stop roller coaster ride Mr Hayes :)  PS it would make an awesome movie, especially the boat shed scene.
B008M87GJK|5.0|A good place for news! Not as bias as regular U.S. news! Well organised and well written. Its nice to be able to read the stories and have video clips.
B008XBHBX2|5.0|Loved it when it first came out.  Still one of the best shark movies ever!!  I have watched it a bunch of times when it comes on TV.  Never gets old.  A awesome great classic!!  One of my top 10 movies of all time.

031623480X|4.0|This book is written by a doctor but in an easy to understand style.  Having read \\"Wheat Belly\\" by William Davis, I was already aware of the genetically altered grains that are causing us serious problems.  I know they can make you fat.<br /><br />Now along comes \\"Grain Brain\\" and it tells us these same genetically altered breads are causing a lot of our brain diseases.  Mention Alzheimer's and you've got everyone's attention.  And I agree with the author, we need to try to prevent diseases instead of just trying to cure them after we get them.  The book starts off with a self assessment.  I don't think there would be many people who would score a zero.  For instance, Do you eat bread? Do you have more than 1 serving of a fruit a day?  (Yeah, I have a hard time with that being bad for you.)  Do you eat cereal?  Do you eat a low fat diet?  Just a few of the questions.  We're all going to see ourselves there.<br /><br />I believe there's a lot of vabluable information in this book.  But it's going to be hard for most of us to make the changes he suggests.  He promises this program can help ADHD, anxiety and chronic stress, headaches and migraines, depression, diabetes, epilepsy, concentration problems, inflammatory conditions including arthritis, insomnia, intestinal problems including celiac, gluten sensitivity and irritable bowel, memory problems and mild cognitive impairment, frequently a pre-cursor to Alzheimer's, mood disorders, overweight and obesity, Tourettes and more!!  He sites examples of patients who have dramatically turned their health around after following this plan.  It is pretty impressive.  The plan is the part I have issues with.  It would be difficult for most people to follow.  Eliminate all sources of gluten (whole wheat, noodles, pastas, baked goods, cereals) all processed carbs, sugar and starch (included are frozen yogurt, dried fruits, honey, agave and of course, sugar.) Packaged foods labeled fat free or low fat.  Margarine and any commercial brand of cooking oil (including canola, peanut and grape seed oil.)  Avoid all soy. And you should also check your bathroom for gluten free products.  WHAT?  He recommends buying organic or wild foods whenever possible.  The snacks allowed are a joke - cold peeled shrimp w/lemon and dill?<br /><br />While you will get lots of info in this book about the effects of gluten and sugar, the plan is not very feasible.  Most of us can't afford to buy all of our groceries at a health food store.  So, I'd say read the book and follow the plan as much as you can.  It will help if only done partially.  It doesn't have to be all of nothing.  Just try to eat whole foods as much as possible, eliminate the \\"fake\\" grains and sugar.  Those are the main culprits.<br /><br />Informative book and worth a read.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|A great hidden object game that's actually free! I have played other hidden object games in the past that claim to be free in the beginning, but then later it ask you to pay when it  starts to get interesting. With The Secret Society game you just need have patience because it uses energy to move around the game.

B00ANGICRE|5.0|I admit that I was skeptical about this film. After all, I read the essay \\"On Seeing a Sex Surrogate\\" back in The Day; and I'm an admirer of the late Mark O'Brien's poetry.  I hate \\"disability of the week\\" movies, and I was worried this would be one.  Well, I was oh, so wrong.  The Sessions gives me hope on many levels.<br /><br />HOPEFULNESS SCALE:<br />1) The Sessions addresses Mark O'Brien's need to fully become an adult at 38 -- both emotionally and sexually.<br />2) The Sessions opens with a shot of O'Brien's iron lung in his *home.* (Many folks won't even know what an iron lung is or what it does. After this film, folks'll know.)<br />3) Due to the subject matter, there's a lot of nudity (full-frontal female only), talk of sex and sex between an able-bodied woman and a man whose body is paralyzed from the neck down.<br />4)The Sessions shows people with disabilities as sensual, sexual human beings. And some as isolated human beings. (Isolation is a common problem for us.)<br />5) The Sessions' Cheryl explains the difference between a sex surrogate and a prostitute. (One doesn't want repeat business, the other does.) Ms. Hunt is almost normal weight as Cheryl. This makes her appear more sensual and fully adult. The Sessions between Mark and Cheryl are shown as mutually nourishing.<br />6) Some of O'Brien's attendants are depicted as caring and others as not so much.<br />7) The Priest is also shown as a caring man, who, at first, has no clue how to deal with O'Brien's long-winded, funny, and, by necessity, out-in-the-open public confessions. Over the course of the film, they become friends.<br />8) O'Brien was a devout Catholic in life, and he is shown to be one in The Sessions.<br />7) The Sessions closes with the iron lung.<br /><br />STEP BACKWARDS FOR DISABILITY RIGHTS SCALE:<br />1) The Sessions was made with the sensibilities of the able-bodied in mind. Just sayin'.<br />2) Mark O'Brien was shown solely on a gurney when he's out and about. O'Brien used aspecialized wheel chair, too -- and was using it during the time he was seeing Cheryl. It's a nit-picky point, but it's an important point.<br /><br />On the whole, though, The Sessions broke a barrier. For once, I watched a film in which the person with a disability is a human being -- not a victim, not a courageous Polio, not a perfect construct labeled Disabled Man in Iron Lung Circa 1990. Mark O'Brien is shown to be a flawed, lonely,intelligent, humorous individual filled with longing to be loved -- and to lose his virginity before he dies. AND it's filled with quotes from the real O'Brien's writings.<br /><br />Speaking as a person with multiple disabilities, I think The Sessions is a fine, if flawed, film. It treated me as an adult most of the time; and it gives our society a glimpse into a world it's just not used to seeing. The Sessions could be an excellent starting point for an interesting discussion... I recommend it highly. And --<br /><br />Yay! Just Yay!
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|I am a voracious reader and end up reading a lot of &#34;dogs&#34; while looking for something that I really like. This book was engaging and gave me a different view of Canada, told in a narrative form. It's a good story and, although it had a certain amount of anti American rhetoric, it was well worth reading.
B0073RFS5A|1.0|I actually didn't finish this book, giving up after about a third.  It is very poorly written, I have no idea why the ghost writer was selected.  Between the poor writing and the very strong political preaching I struggled to even get through as much as I did read.
B0095VPAVE|5.0|Has been great since may, takes everything I throw at it along with 8gb of ram! Nice budget processor. BF3 at high, most everything maxed out! Would buy again for another budget build!
B00005AQE8|5.0|what more can I say banging from book 1 to book 2 not 1 song will be skipped. if your a PAC fan a West Coast fan you cannot deny this to be a masterpiece. A must have in any music library period!
B00BUKODDO|4.0|I've listened to a lot of Gary Burton(lofty anagram &#34;68), and this was a solid album for anybody who is a fan
B0070Y46UY|2.0|This book is full of too much imagination and the reality gets mixed up. I did not get it finished.
B00BTV62KG|4.0|This was my first experience of buying a Scofield album, although I had heard him through the years on jazz stations. It was worth the price.
B00EAI9CSY|5.0|Finally, a vampire story that explores the paralyzing loneliness that must come with immortality. Something sorely overlooked in the slew of human-vamp love stories flooding the media these days. Great to see themes untouched since the likes of Bram Stoker and Anne Rice, and at the center of it all two strong, determined female leads. The film also boasts impressive, yet never heavy-handed CG. Very satisfying indeed.
1579128149|5.0|My 11 yr old loves the humorous style.  It makes all the difference in igniting the desire to learn.  Now I know from him that Flurium has a half life of only 8 mins, so it is very unlikely to me much of it around in the world at any given moment.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I liked the searching and matching games, but the arranging of the 'spells' kind of sucked as the hint didn't really do anything helpful.
B000065K6N|2.0|It lacks really good plot that would be similar to &#34;Kikki&#34; or &#34;Spirited away&#34;. The animations are good but this is a typical action/adventure/combat film without much more.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I liked this book but not as much as Khaled Hosseini's two previous books.  It is always educating to read this author's books.  I learned the name of Middle Eastern poets. It was a well told compelling story.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|THE QUALITY OF THE DVD WAS VERY GOOD. THE CONTENT OF THE MOVIE WAS GREAT. IT WAS INTENSE AND SAD, BUT SO MOVING. IT IS EXCITING TO HAVE A MOVIE THAT IS AN ENTERTAINING DRAMA, YET ALSO INCLUDE MESSAGES RELATED TO GOD'S PLAN AND DESIRE FOR OUR LIVES.
8866137634|5.0|If you want to say, &#34;eff you, NSA&#34;, this is it.  This can be 100% snoop proof data management.<br /><br />I keep a smaller gridded one in my front pocket at all times. It has all kinds of things that are important to me in it.  Wonderfully hack-proof.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, but I am an adult. I would not recommend it for teenage readers, unless they are mature for the age.
B00CRR5YA0|1.0|I never got my download and am very disappointed.  Now I to take time to report it.  What link do I goto?
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This series is great for teens and adults alike who want a sci-fi, clean story with just the right amount of love, drama, sorrow and comedy! These books are page-turners!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Loved this game wished there was more to this game for I thought it was the full game. I am not disappointed about the game. I really got into it. Thinking on whether to get the full game or not. Epic Adventurers Cursed On board is a very good game love hidden object games.
B009DCOU9S|2.0|I can imagine some people liking this game, hence the two stars, but we found so many things irritating about it. The biggest one was the amount of talking the characters do... makes the whole game a turn off pretty quickly. Don't spend your money on this, unless you enjoy listening to talking heads about stolen magic things and whatever else.
0670020745|5.0|Fascinating true account from a neuroscience Ph.D - she tells her story both as a Harvard Doctor and as a patient - I recommend - tells what it is like to be a stroke victim and how to approach/help patients.  Great true story
B0066W1AZK|1.0|I personally do not like the app. I tried playing with the computer and no body could win or lose. I played about 15 times, no check mate, no wins or losses. Also I tried moving certain pieces that were valid moves but it wouldn't let me do them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game its the best. Its TOTALLY WORTH 7$ My little girl will make houses and love it and play on it for hours and never get bored she plays it all day and all night GET THIS APP
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Totally addicting. I hate games, but love this one. I just wish It was easier to understand and you return to where you died.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This is so cool. I like it though because it is challenging and i think its a great game for kids
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Outstanding performances by a great cast. Look forward to MANY more episodes! Season five will have many twists and turns to be sure.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|BOZ SCAGGS-MEMPHIS: Sparkling pop hits aside, indigenous singer/guitarist BOZ SCAGGS has always been most at home interpreting and reinventing strains of rhythm & blues, which he does effortlessly on the largely all covers project MEMPHIS, his finest platter since 1997's roots themed COME ON HOME. Bookended by a pair of SCAGGS originals, the big BOZ-man tastefully dusts off JIMMY REED, THE METERS and AL GREEN, injecting his nocturnal vocal funk and obvious passion for the genre. SCAGGS adheres closely to MINK DEVILLE's dark imprint on MOON MARTIN's CADILLAC WALK, also tackling DEVILLE's own winsome chestnut MIXED UP SHOOK UP GIRL with smoky after hours verve. He revisits the sixties era of sweet soul slams via LOVE ON A TWO WAY STREET, CAN I CHANGE MY MIND and RAINY NIGHT IN GEORGIA, an astounding, poignant reading of southern soul man TONY JOE WHITE's best known composition. Backed by a who's who of session aces from guitarist RAY PARKER JR. and legendary Memphis keyboardist SPOONER OLDMAN to bassist WILLIE WEEKS and drummer STEVE JORDAN, MEMPHIS flows like sweet molasses, oozing lush groove-ology and down home mojo every step of the way.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR SWEET SPOTS
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The stellar cast does a spectacular job in producing a movie in the classic fashion of on the set dialogue and song.  Excellent work.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I think the author is brilliant...so many twists and turns and for me a completely unexpected ending. Gillian has an amazing imagination to think up all the angles in this novel. It is a pretty fast read because you dont want to put it down. I would recommend it, and I will be reading another one of her books.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|The quality of the production and cast is first rate.  This is an enjoyable capture of an outstanding set of performances at a great venue.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|he loves this series, i can't get him to read anything else! i enjoy them too, reading over hsi shoulder :)
B008X8RSTM|4.0|Used extensively with a Kindle HD Fire on a recent cycling holiday across north west Germany. A great compliment to cycling maps when greater detail was needed to find way around towns/cities and to locate bike shops, tourist attractions, accommodation etc.<br /><br />Would have benefited from an overarching national map of district and city maps.
B003MC5N28|4.0|I enjoyed this whole trilogy, and this is an excellent read. So far, I have enjoyed all of Lois Lowry books.
B003ELY7PG|5.0|If you didn't read 37signals' book &#34;Getting Real&#34; than this is book for. It is almost the same as &#34;Getting Real&#34;.<br />But anyway both books are great and worth money I spent.<br /><br />Highly recommend!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Its a good mouse you can change the Anchor Symbol color. The max setting for sensitivity is insane. You can Map all the buttons. Braided cable etc. Great for someone with a big hands. Great mouse for the Money
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|love it though sometimes the reaction time is off which causes you to crash.  Other than that tons of fun and super cute!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like it. very addictive. you will love it downloaded for my daughter. and it keeps her busy for hours
0385360169|1.0|I tried to listen to it in the car, and honestly, her voice just drove me nuts. I couldn't finish the book, so to this day I *STILL* don't know what all the fuss is about. Plus, I felt like a lot of it was just completely unrealistic... Eh! Boo! Disappointing!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I don't usually Like horror, but American Horror Story is filled with drama as well as humor. Jessica Lange is outstanding as she portrays Sister Jude.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Entertaining and fun to watch.  Engaging.  All 3 seasons are great.  My husband and I enjoyed them very much indeed.
B0039O8AQK|5.0|The movie carried the Message and the Spirit of the book without fail.  Central Planning requires constant war.  It is difficult to hold Authority over a population that is not in constant fear.  The book should have been named 2014, or 2024, but that just goes to show that Orwell was a Visionary and not a Psychic.
B0076HNMU0|5.0|If you haven't seen Twin Peaks, watch it. If it makes you uncomfortable, good. If you watch the whole thing and you don't like it, we aren't friends anymore.<br /><br />Kudos to Amazon for finding an HD version and putting it on Prime!
B000PY52EU|2.0|Samuel Jackson was the only reason I watched the movie.  The movie itself just wasn't interesting.  Christina Ricci looked great.  She has turned into a beautiful woman.  The technical part of the movie was great.  The entertaining<br />part was boring.
B008469DGY|4.0|While it would be nice to play a full course, that's not the game.  It's fun and addictive as is.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|It's the last of the Potter series. Part 1 was slow and drawn out. This bears multiple watches. Loved it and the book.
B000002J03|5.0|This is the album that sold all the doubters from the debut album. If you didn't like this you were just deaf! and stupid! One of my all-time favorites. Still stands up today. Lost on today's youth for the most part though. Hip Hop? NO! ROCK! ROCK! ROCK!
B000OJFV4C|1.0|This movie used a historic setting to portray pure porn.  It should now be allowed to be viewed.  I turned it off after only a few minutes.  Not redeeming value.  It is smut.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|Gandhi! A truly great human being. We could all learn something from this man's life. Ben Kingsley's portrayal of gandhi here is nothing short of brilliant! The film itself should be in the AFI's Top 100 films of all-time but alas it isn't but I've put it in mine! You should too!
B000NTHT6G|5.0|Loved it all and I am not a Will Ferrell fan usually. Music was awesome too! The twist at the end with the final thought of one can live with ordinary was classic
B000R8YC18|5.0|This performance is one of the greatest performances ever filmed. DeNIRO is just perfect here. Just perfect. And Scorese scores again! That man has one incredible vision. I hope he lives forever! These two make a great team! Fantastic film!
1401937519|5.0|This book is proof that when connected to Source miracles and I mean real miracles can happen. Very inspiring and should give lots of people hope!
B003GR90E6|5.0|Love these and the fit is perfect. I wear a size 14 so hard to find my size. So to get them in my size, well can't get any better.
B000L53D4O|5.0|The twins play with this every day and I firmly believe it helped then walk faster<br />well worth the price and its Fisher Price.
B000O178BY|5.0|I think it would be foolish to compare this album to other albums by Nine Inch Nails. NIN progressively changes it's style throughout each album, but still maintains a signature sound to it. I can, however, compare this to The Downward Spiral, by saying that I think it's a great album.<br /><br />The way I define whether I think an album is good or note is by asking myself, &#34;How many songs do I like/love&#34;. If you like only half of the songs in an album, I would consider that crap-bronze, and not worth buying. Liking more than half, but not most of the songs would be fine, but I would still debate on buying something else. If you like most of the songs, it is very much worth the money, and very rarely do you ever find an album in which you like all of the songs. I love The Downward Spiral, and I would consider this second place (alongside With Teeth), simply because there's like 1 or 2 songs I don't like.<br /><br />Overall, I consider this a great buy, and if you're a NIN fan I would give this a shot. It has a great theme too, I dunno if your into that.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|this is a very bad app way to fast and I really thought I was getting the game my cell phone has this game
B007N31ZLA|5.0|This review is primarily for the blu-ray picture quality, sound quality, etc.-- not for how good the story or acting is. \\"The Sting\\" has an excellent HD picture, with accurate colors, vivid colors, and it's quite sharp, though a 1973 film. The audio is excellent as well. I'm very pleased with this purchase.  It looks excellent on my HD TV.<br /><br />Great job on this classic film's Blu-Ray picture, it has fine HD quality for a 1973 film, clearly remastered with care.<br /><br />The story is terrific, it is a classic, maybe it's even a great movie.  The acting by Paul Newman, Robert Redford, and Robert Shaw is top-notch.  The script is top-notch, too.  This movie does not treat the viewer like an idiot; you are expected to notice some things-- they're not highlighted for you.<br /><br />One of the best grifter movies ever, alongside the later HOUSE OF GAMES and SHADE.  MUCH better than THE GRIFTERS.<br /><br />THE STING blu ray is HIGHLY recommended on all counts!
B006VRRGNK|5.0|Product showed up earlier than expected, good quality. Definitely well worth it. Price was very fair especially being a three disc set
B009VB97EY|1.0|I am female in my 30's and just as crazy about a bunch of hot men dancing around, but I jus didn't get it with this show. The story line was blah and Matthew is looking old, Channing was nice to look at but after awhile it was like ok I'm done. Save your money and wait for it to come on tv.
B00992CF6W|5.0|U have to buy this app it's 6 bucks worth the awesome!!!!!!!!! I love it I have it for my lap top 2 it's the best!!!!!!!!!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my sister who hasn't seen the show.  She loves it.  Makes a wonderful gift, and so much better to spend your evenings watching shows like this rather than the reality shows that are everywhere on regular programming
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's fun for kids to play .he learn how to act fast with his finger ,to move up right or left . It amazing..
0688002307|5.0|This was my third copy to buy. I have to keep it at my own place, in my office and at my parents' place.
B0073XV2W2|4.0|A fun read. Well paced and not predictable. Liked the characters.<br />This is the third Suarez book I've read and they keep getting better.
B004WR125O|4.0|Worked perfectly.  You have to wait for the first connection.  It can take a few minutes but once you get the password in and it saves it, just simply go over to the &#34;Net&#34; portion and start using.  It still said no connection at one point but still function perfectly.  Get the Onkyo App to accompany this great tool.
B00062PN6I|3.0|I'm a fan of Behringer products.  They make 'good enough' stuff at many levels that have really opened up the world of Pro Audio to the masses.<br /><br />This is one of those good enough products.  It's incredibly low cost for what you get.  It's well made (although not REALLY well made.. just well made), and it'll stand up to average use (I wouldn't put them in a classroom, for instance).<br /><br />The sound quality is in the same range.  It's not great, but it's good enough.  Closed cup, but not really well closed, so you get some bleed from your bandmates if you're in the same room.<br /><br />But if you're on a budget, and you need 5 or 10 headphones for, say, an underground radio station or ghetto recording studio: these rock.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|For a film, the first installment of the Hobbit is a really a well done picture<br />and entertaining adventure.<br />Does it match the book, word-for-word, chapter-for-chapter. No, and I don't<br />expect that from the other two releases. That said, as a movie it's awesome.<br />Seems like every reader of Tolkien's books has a mental image of how and what<br />the characters and landscape should look like. If you're a purist, stick to the books.<br />If love the books, and are open to another's vision of these tales, you're in for a treat!
B009IU6BIS|5.0|I watch this movie at least once a year - especially when it seems like Christmas is too far away.  I never cease to laugh at it because it reminds me of so much that I have done myself in Christmases past.
0399159347|5.0|There are two questions that help me gauge the value of a novel. Did I find it difficult to put down? Did the story linger with me after I finish reading the final page? For The Husband's Secret, I enthusiastically answered yes to both questions. I found the characters to be so well drawn and compelling that I cared about what happened to each one of them. What part will Cecelia, Tess, and Rachel play in each other's lives? Moriarty slowly connects the dots with humor, poignancy, and more than one intricate plot twist. A highly recommended read and one that will surely have you thinking about the little secrets in your own life.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Would love to get this series in 4K,  is it available?<br />The costumes and scenery were exceptional and I highly recommend it.
B00C1040TO|5.0|This tuner does SO many things SO well... I still use my strobe tuner, but that's because of a limitation on my tablet, NOT the tuner.<br /><br />I play low notes. Low notes are hard to get enough samples to report quickly. In spite of that, on a Galaxy Note 10.1 this software get reasonable response down a couple octaves below the bass clef.  I do find, though, that my strobe tuner with a clip-on microphone settles a bit faster (i.e. before I run out of air to sustain the note steadily.)<br /><br />But that is almost beside the point.  The selection and use of intonation BESIDE equal temperament is nothing short of fabulous! For example, if I want to work on just intonation in the key of F, setting that basis is as easy as double tapping a clearly marked letter on the main screen.  Then I can play drones from the tuner, tune against them, and compare what my ear thinks is right against what the meter &#34;thinks.&#34;  And the tight thirds WILL match between my ear and the tuner.<br /><br />If I then wish to switch to Bb, I just double tap again and I'm already on my way.<br /><br />With the metronome and &#34;mini-recorder&#34; this is more of a practice session manager than just a tuner.  I use it just about every day, and can show the improvements... via recordings from the tool :)
B001NHNG64|5.0|My favorite reacher novel so far. Great pace and story, as usual. But this story thrills with conspiracy theorists versus the government as well.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I got a great guide to using Trimble Sketchup for woodworking.  A nice big fat PDF with embedded videos and all.<br /><br />I figured I'd use Adobe Reader on my tablet to go through it.<br /><br />Wrong.<br /><br />Lucky for me exPDF Reader was able to process EVERYTHING in the PDF.<br /><br />It is a bit slower on reviewing long documents.  Being able to watch the embedded videos makes a little page to page delay very acceptable.
0307271080|5.0|This book is amazing. As an African living in America, it touches on so many issues I have experienced and observe other Africans experience, and the story is so well written!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I just love the game. It's a challenge at times, but quite enjoyable. I highly recommend it to people who enjoy Solitaire.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|LOTS OF FUN BUT TAKES A VERY LONG TIME TO COMPLETE A COLLECTION. I FEEL THAT HAVING AN EXCESS OF 45-50 COLLECTION PIECES IS A LITTLE TO EXTREME.  NOT TO EVEN MENTION THE COST INVOLVED IN EACH COLLECTION.
B000002KK2|5.0|I have had this album for YEARS and finally got this cd<br />so I can listen to it in my car. She is the best singer ever.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I wish Green Nook still gave the same coins as it did for awhile. Aside from that I don't  have any complaints I can think of and since I,''ve been playing it for at least 1 year and possibly 2 , I am enjoying Ice Age very much.
B007XF4J70|4.0|Very good quality video and audio, although I would have liked to bring full screen, but this very well. Excellent audio latino. Ok.
B004ULNJIU|5.0|Again as I have stated, TV stinks except for a few educational programs and a very few sports, so we have had to revert to action DVD's to watch on week ends to liven things up for us and this is one of them.  We like Jason.  P Pratt
B002RPR6DU|2.0|Not very good video quality and the worst is that it brings  Castilian Spanish of Spain. I really would have liked to bring audio latino.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|As TV stinks, we have had to revert to buying some older along with some newer action DVD's to liven up our week end movie watching and we like Jason, too.  P Pratt
B0063IH60K|5.0|I PLAY IT EVERY NIGHT. JUST CAN'T GET AS FAST AS SOME PEOPLE. Best game I know to lull me to sleep.
B00AEFYW64|5.0|As TV stinks and most of the programs, except for some educational and some sports, are made for idiots to watch, we have had to revert to some old action DVD's and this is one of them.  P Pratt
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I just started watching it.  I chased seasons 1-3 all over the movie services.  Now I can not wait for Season 4.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Hidden object games on my device, the LG Optimus G, have always been difficult to play due to scenes that are uncomfortably difficult to see. Not so with this game. In addition to being able to see things better, the game provides enough of a challenge to keep it from getting boring.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|You will like it if u r a fan of movies.<br />I am really enjoying it.<br />You should play it and won't regret
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|There are a couple OMG moments! Very cool movie! I'm not even a Tom Cruise fan. It is still worth watching.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Rarely is it advantageous to see a movie before reading the book, but for me, having seen The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo movie first, helped me to identify better with the cast of characters as I read this amazing trilogy.  Either way, if you enjoyed The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, you'll totally enjoy the rest of Lisbeth Salander's journey.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|This book is very simple and straight to the point.  It gave me permission to admire and &#34;copy&#34; other people's work. l loved his sense of humor and honesty!  Thank you Austin Kleon!!
B005LAIIN0|4.0|So I just saw World War Z in a second run theater.  My initial thoughts were a sloppy but entertaining movie. I did not read the 2006 book. The ending seemed hatched and far-fetched. I don't know if the studio wanted a happy ending that also lent itself to a trilogy, but that's what happened. The Jerusalem scene was by far the most visually interesting. The Blu-ray states on the cover that it will be uncut with \\"intense footage not seen in the theaters\\", so if I ever see the bluray version(don't plan on buying it)I would expect better continuity in the script. Final rating 3.8 stars. Go rent it.
B003W9JELC|5.0|I happen to like Miley, or at least use to. Shame she didn't stay the sweet little girl she was.
B008Y6Y1RA|1.0|A silly, goofy movie that I really was not in the mood for.  I did not enjoy it at all.
B00E8B1358|3.0|This movie has some good stars but the action is nothing special. Typical good guys versus bad guys, good guy wins in the end. Too much gun action though..
B000000WJK|5.0|sadly, best known for the overplayed and overused Bittersweet Symphony on the album Urban Hymns - The Verve's freshman album A Storm in Heaven is likely their best work to date. everything just fit together so well with the band when it first came to be, it happens often enough. this album opens and closes very well, I suppose my only complaint would be the length... it isn't quite long enough, the songs are easy to chill out to and 46 minutes in space clearly isn't long enough.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Waited more time for arrival of this product from Google play store, waited more time in contacting Google staff to return this item. BUT took few minutes to know that this product is completely junk. And is waste of money and time.<br /><br />- I bought this from Google play store.<br />- Do not buy this if you have a SMART TV with YouTube and Netflix App and built-in WiFi.<br />- Complete waste of money.<br />- My computer uses WiFi to play YouTube, and then chromecast uses same WiFi to cast to TV.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|\\"What in the heck is going on\\" was the thought rolling around my head while I read this book and for me that's what I liked the most. Fast paced but at times difficult to suspend my disbelief ( man that guy can take a beating!) But ultimately satisfying. Looking forward to continuing adventures on my Kindle and TV screen.

B00A09VWVW|4.0|Some Kindle adaptations of public domain works are full of OCR errors and other issues; this one seems to have been proofread carefully. As for the content, this is a seminal work necessary for understanding the contemporary conversation about economic policy. Many people who have strong feelings about Keynes either way have never actually read his work; the same is also true of Adam Smith and Karl Marx.

B00ESY7QXI|4.0|For some reason I liked this movie which is odd because I didn't like the  book. I think Leo and Toby sold it. The colors, the music, all seemed to fit in the craziness.
159413605X|2.0|When my book club selected this book to read I was initially excited.  I'd heard that it was a best-seller and it seemed to have gotten such high reviews here; but once I started reading the book I found it to be very long and tedious to slog through.  I definitely would have abandoned it long before the end if I hadn't been obligated to finish it for my group.<br /><br />Spoiler alert.<br /><br />My main complaint was that I didn't feel like there was a single person in the book for me to root for until almost the very end.  I'd figured out fairly early on in Part I that Amy's diary was faked so I wasn't rooting for \\"poor neglected Amy\\" like I guess we were supposed to.  But Nick was just SUCH a douche bag all throughout the book that I certainly couldn't root for him either.  All through the endlessly long first act we have to listen to his self-centered whining about how everyone takes everything he does the wrong way and Amy never really loved him right and blah, blah, blah. He's never once the least bit worried about where Amy is, and this is BEFORE he knows that she set the whole thing up so by rights he SHOULD have been worried about her.  Any normal guy would be at least a tiny bit worried about his wife of five years' well-being in that situation, even if their marriage had been on the rocks.  But the only thing Nick's worried about is covering his own butt and griping about the scavenger hunt.  Not to mention that he's been banging a college co-ed for the last YEAR and even comes straight out and says that he'd deliberately been hoping to make Amy miserable-enough to leave him, rather than him just leaving her, so that he could maintain his image as the \\"good guy\\".  If he'd just manned up and left her a year ago, she wouldn't have had time to plan this elaborate \\"faked her own death\\" thing like she did.<br /><br />And when it finally does come to light that Amy planned the whole thing to set Nick up, his absolute FIRST thought is \\"well that totally absolves me of any and all wrong-doing on the adultery thing then because deep down somewhere I must have subconsciously known she was a psycho.  Like the way people with an iron deficiency crave red meat!\\"  No, Nick.  It doesn't magically make you a good person just because it turns out your wife is a psycho.  It just means you're both bad people.<br /><br />The only time I started to like Nick was at the very, very, very end when he decides to start taking some responsibility and thinking about someone other than himself for a change.  When he vows to get the goods on crazy Amy for killing Desi and make sure she ends up in jail.  That's the only time he acts like the actual hero of the story, and that isn't until hundreds of pages into the book.<br /><br />Even the secondary characters were either boring, annoying or unlikable.  Amy's parents were ineffectual airheads who'd exploited her childhood for money.  Nick's sister was just a sad sack version of Jiminy Cricket who occasionally scolded Nick for being a jerk but overall didn't do much.  The cops weren't awful but most of their lines were written in that \\"I'm pretending to be your buddy, be your pal, be your friend,\\" sleazy speak that got really annoying to read after a while.  The college co-ed Nick was sleeping with came across as kind of a nimrod the way she completely failed to grasp the concept that with his wife missing Nick himself would be the prime suspect and if it became known he'd been banging a girl half his age for the last year that just MIGHT cause some issues.  Most of the towns people are either spotlight hoggers or just faceless and interchangeable.  Honestly, the people I liked best were probably the defense lawyer and his wife because they had the most honest characters out of everybody.<br /><br />The story itself was an interesting one and it's plain from the reviews that for some people that's enough.  So if you're one of those people that can enjoy a plot and ignore the characters, then you'll like this story.  I really need at least one character to get behind and root for in the story or else I get bored, and this story just didn't have that so I never really got into it.
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|Very good movie as it gives the day to day Governament, Congressmen/woman/senators, lobbyyist,media. operates in dayy to day weeling,dealing, and very little support to the peoples that put them in the office. just self power/monies.<br /><br />looking forward to the season-2

0143124544|2.0|They say that all ideas that the world ever needs are already out there. There is a truth in it, but I cannot seem to tell if the seed for this book is from Sanjay Leela Bansali's bollywood movie, Guzaarish. The movie came out in the year 2010 and the book's first publication was in 2012. Its possible that the concept about quadriplegics is a coincidence, however the precise combination of the core idea - quadriplegics and euthanasia - behind the movie and the book being the one and same is subject to skepticism, in my opinion.<br /><br />Despite my scruples, I can't help, but give it two stars - the narrative still calls for a rating.

B00AS1Q93S|4.0|The theme of the movie fits the books well.  Since I have read most of the Reacher series, I appreciated the story line well.<br />I do not understand using Tom Cruise as the Jack Reacher  character.  In each book Jack is described as 6'5&#34; and either<br />220 or 250 LBS.  I really think that you could find an actor that fits the character better than Tom Cruise at 5'7&#34; and 160#.<br />I still like the story line and look forward to more.  Jim Price.

B00000I1OY|4.0|I just watched this film (I've seen it a few times over the years), and it is still relevant -- especially today, 2013, as the Great Recession grinds on and many formerly wealthy have been humbled.<br /><br />Sadly, the ending is badly done though the rest of the film is well worth watching. Lancaster's performance as a suburban executive who has lost his job, his family, his home and is having a mental breakdown is particularly sensitive.<br /><br />I grew up in Fairfield County, CT, during the '50s and '60s, and at the time it was shocking for a man to lose his job (women didn't work where we lived), almost more shocking than if he had a mental breakdown. Not being able to afford the lifestyle required of the area was the stuff of whispers at cocktail parties. Believe me, I overheard the talk, rare as it was, at my parents' shindigs where everybody indeed \\"drank too much.\\" I think the scariest thing for grownups at the time was imagining the unimaginable -- being out of work.<br /><br />Today, of course, the unimaginable is no longer a rarity. Losing one's job, losing one's home, losing one's health coverage, and/or losing one's mind are fairly common occurrences now. So common, that a modicum of shame is alleviated by the fact that these misfortunes *are* so common. Not sure whether that's good or bad, but it is a sign of the times.<br /><br />Viewers should read Cheever's short story, on which this film is based. It's quite marvelous and really captures the feeling of well-to-do suburbanites during the \\"Mad Men\\" era.<br /><br />By the way, that's John Cheever in a cameo at the big pool party. He shakes hands with the girl who plays Burt's former babysitter. (My husband met the author at a party in the '70s; Cheever was in his cups and talked about the film and his unfulfilled desire to, for some bizarre reason, \\"paint Burt blue.\\"

B000JMKQX0|4.0|I think the editing was off. The stepping off points from the different story threads were sometimes awkward. Once an emotional investment is made, poof the story moves on. There's so much material it seems as if many of the threads could have been there own novel. A strong investment in research was clearly made to allow such a vivid and potentially accurate portrait of an apocalypse.<br /><br />Well Done.

B00F57VFXO|5.0|\\"The sight of a German rocket streaking through one's window at two in the morning is quite sobering,\\" Ian Fleming wrote in his diary, neglecting to mention that his first thought after the incident was where else to take the young lady he was with at the time. The incident had yet another repercussion: Fleming was thrust into a forced domesticity with his longtime \\"steady\\" Ann O'Neill.<br /><br />The scenes of battered yet defiant London are probably less powerful than little things we observe from the start of this novel: making the breakfast with the last of the eggs, fishing out cigarette butts from an ashtray, Ann, who's wearing an altered pair of Fleming's navy blue trousers and \\"scavenging crystallized sugar crusts off the rim of the sugar bowl.\\" Things are decidedly different from the \\"half-forgotten paradise that was London before the war.\\"<br /><br />Damian Stevenson uses all but a mere handful of pages to firmly set the boundaries and the feeling of the time in which \\"The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Parsifal\\" is set before thrusting us into action. Breakfast and a car chase, anyone? Yet, this is just a small taste of what's to come.<br /><br />As we know now, there were numerous plots to remove Hitler from power. In this novel, one of such plots has a codename: \\"Operation Parsifal.\\" A \\"The members of Parsifal are bankers, representatives of top German businesses, officials from the Navy and Ministry of Armaments, the list goes on.\\" Wolfgang Krupp, one of the most powerful industrialists in Germany at the time, is one of them. However, what is more important, is that Rommel, the \\"Desert Fox\\" himself, is rumored to throw his hat into the ring as well. With a man like Rommel backing the plot, it might actually succeed.<br /><br />A modern reader might ask, \\"So, why not? If those people were to succeed removing or assassinating Hitler, that would have been a good thing, right?\\" However, considering the constantly changing political climate and uncertain alliances of the World War Two, the British government sees a potential problem: Krupp still sees the war as winnable; and if Germans make peace with the Soviets, then it is the rise of the Forth Reich, and God help the rest of the Europe, or what remains of it. The information about Parsifal is desperately needed.<br /><br />This is where Ian Fleming comes in. While it is not in his \\"official\\" purview to go on dangerous missions into foreign countries, or as he jokes, \\"I've been protected [from the war] by my desk and sandbags of paperwork,\\" in the times of war even the secret services cannot be too choosy. As \\"the only cunning linguist available who knows which end of a .38 is up,\\" who's actually \\"been in the field a few times,\\" Fleming is to go to Cairo to retrieve Krupp's right-hand man, who eloped with Krupp's fianc&eacute;, and who may have information about what is really going on at the highest levels of German politics.<br /><br />Just like the previous novel from \\"The Ian Flemings Files,\\" \\"Operation Armada,\\" this book is written in a true James Bond-ian canon. The danger is presented clearly at the beginning, yet it keeps evolving over the course of the story, taking unexpected twists and turns. There's even a small \\"equipment\\" scene present before Fleming is to go on a mission, as is traveling to exotic places by a submarine. However, in this book we keep picking up small tidbits about Ian Fleming himself, his family, and his relationships. This too is done in the grand tradition: the self-searching touches are always present in James Bond books. Granted, this is a fictionalized novel, but this holds great interest to the Ian Fleming's and James Bond's fans nonetheless, to look at Fleming from a different angle, and to ask, \\"What if?\\"<br /><br />With very clear and mature writing style, Stevenson guides us through the adventures of Ian Fleming through the dangers of covert operations of WWII, that could have been, and perhaps, in our mind's eye, truly were. Iwas looking forward to reading this book for a while and I am glad to finally get a copy of it in my hands. This is a strong recommendation to anyone who is looking for their \\"James Bondian\\" fix.ooking forward to reading this book for a while and I am glad to finally get a copy of it in my hands.

B008Y1YK0I|5.0|The beautifully filmed scenes of the rolling Arabian sand dunes will absolutely take your breath away! Yes, it's that good!
B00C7L4QB4|3.0|My review is intended as a review of the program itself, for anyone who would consider purchasing this product without having seen the show first. Unfortunately I have not purchased the physical DVD set from Amazon. Although I cannot make any comment on that particular front, I can vouch for previous purchases for DVDs from Amazon that have been top quality.<br /><br />In anticipation of the television premiere, a writer for the Atlantic Monthly wrote that the \\"greatest irony is that while Will [Graham] can see the processes of killers elsewhere, he remains blind to the one right in front of him [meaning one of his sole friends, Dr. Hannibal Lector, M.D.].\\" This plot structure gives the program a compelling drive, and much credit for it should be given to Brian Fuller and the writing staff. Their second best accomplishment is surely their incorporation of quotations and motifs from the Thomas Harris novels; fans of the movies Manhunter and its remake Red Dragon, as well as the namesake novel of the second, will instantly recognize Will and Hannibal's conversation about \\"God feeling powerful,\\" doing awful things simply for that reason, and Jack Crawford's anguish over an internee gone missing on an off-the-books assignment while on his watch is reminiscent of his working relationship with Clarice Starling. These are only a few allusions, and the careful viewer will start seeing them peppered everywhere.<br /><br />With the cast NBC assembled, you would expect the acting not to be anything short of excellent. And you would not be wrong. Mads Mikkelsen was a perfect choice for the role of the diabolical doctor. His Hannibal is familiar with his suave sophistication and familiar enough to Anthony Hopkins and Brian Cox's characters, but he also brings a genteel reserve that was overshadowed by the subtle menace of his predecessors. This doctor has the viability to be an upstanding member of the community, a wolf who is just as comfortable in sheep's clothing as without.Lawrence Fishborne is his usual stellar self as Jack Crawford. He joins a host of actors to have portrayed that role as those who made Hannibal so famous, from Harvey Kietel most recently to Scott Glenn to Denis Farina. In short, he is so good at what he does that it's just plain fun to watch the man at work. The film nerds and movie buffs will relish the appearance of his actual wife, Gina Torres, as his fictional wife Bella. Hugh Dancy plays Will Graham. Even though he masters an American accent beyond reproach, his character feels like the weak link in the present company. I can't help but feel this was an overacted role, and that the Will Graham in Hannibal is a far cry away from the gritty, jaded, and hard boiled detective from the novel and whom Will Peterson and Ed Norton portrayed. Whether actor or director had more to do with this is beyond my amateur experience to say.<br /><br />This is a good segue into explaining why I chose to give the program an overall three instead of five stars, because most of my complaints center around Will's character- this guy is WAY too withdrawn, emotionally vulnerable, and socially awkward without balancing qualities to be a compelling hero. Furthermore, what passes for detective work on the show seems like evidently lazy writing to me. Granted, it's not like Thomas Harris wrote a trustworthy police handbook, either. But in the very least that author has his characters make connections between evidence and events with some degree of logic, whereas Hannibal's creative team was content to make Graham's empathy disorder work more like some bizarre telepathy. Willing suspensions of disbelief aside, the mental leaps Will makes grow and more stale with each passing episode. Character development starts off very strong, but by the series conclusion I couldn't help but feel somehow cheated; for example, without trying to spoil too much, Hannibal's effort to `help' Will, to be a real friend, is never satisfactorily explained as being either genuine or simply sadistic. Some elaboration on his logic seems called for.<br /><br />As such, I could only give Hannibal a mediocre rating as a whole. I did thoroughly enjoy watching it on TV, and certain episodes stand out as being great in and of themselves (especially Fromage), but in the end it left me feeling like this could have been so much more. Overall, not a bad purchase.

0307476073|5.0|I read _Wild_ in less than a week, while I was between jobs in the Spring of 2013 (so, well after it's wildly popular reception). I enjoyed it thoroughly, and the only reason I would give it anything less than 5 stars would be my irritation with for the hype which engulfed its release.<br /><br />One can tell that Cheryl Strayed was an English major, and she must surely have been a great student as well. The way in which she reconstructs anecdotes not only from her adventure (sometimes misadventure) but also scenes from her childhood made me feel as if I weren't so much reading a fine book but instead speaking with an excellent conversationalist. I couldn't recommend this so much as a book to tell you about wilderness living (although you will certainly get that here, from someone who is unabashedly open and funny in retelling the mistakes she made along the way). Think of this more as a well written book on the human condition, an emotional experience in grief and the way in which it changes our lives.<br /><br />Moralists (I know a few) who read that last statement might accuse me of arguing that Strayed's mother's death was some kind of excuse for her behavior. But if you read this book and walk away with only that impression, then you've missed the point entirely. Those who would dwell on her amateurish outdoorsmanship (or, should I say `outdoorswomanship'? Spell check is telling me I can't...) are equally wrong. Again, if you're expecting this to be a `how-to' book on surviving the PCT, you're better served elsewhere.<br /><br />[Slight spoiler alert] I imagine that Ms. Strayed herself would puncture my joke on gender by reminding me of incidents where she thought this trek would make her a hard-core `Amazon warrior Queen,' only to have such a dream come crashing down to earth because of something as mundane as footwear that was a few sizes too small, properly sized boots that the well-meaning and customer service-oriented people of REI had sent yet never arrived at the right post stations on the trail because signatures or other authorizations from the hiker herself were required, and (best of all) the grueling and comedic (in a dark sort of way) image of her having to rough it out on the trails in the only footwear left at her disposal:  a pair of flip flops. Although this was a miserable experience at the time, it takes on a type 2 tone in the retelling (one of those experiences you hate at the time, but later on you're not so mad about it, may even laugh). These lighthearted passages occur between the more gut-wrenching (even for a sourpuss like me) memories of her childhood and adolescence (no spoilers on those, I would make a poor representation anyway).<br /><br />Don't expect Ms. Strayed to pull at your sympathy or condolences-  the content may be sad sometimes, but she has absolutely not put forth a pity piece. What Ms. Strayed has chosen to share with us is a well-written, personable, and interesting narrative from an exciting time in her life.
B002MW50KO|1.0|As the title of my review states, I have not, nor will I ever do my ears the injustice of listening to this album.  I LOVE Bob Dylan.  He is my favorite artist of all-time.  What the guy did in the 60's and 70's was absolutely magical.  But I think that we all need to face the fact that his voice is shot and is intolerable to listen to.  His last few albums, though the songwriting and music is good, are unlistenable because of how bad his voice is.  I've tried really hard to get past it, but the man just needs to come to terms with the fact that his voice is gone.  He has no business putting out a Christmas album.  I can imagine what him singing \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" would sound like and it's not something that I want to put myself through.

B00F57VFXO|5.0|Having already read and loved The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada, I'd been waiting for The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Parsifal by Damian Stevenson to come out. The author, an expert on Ian Fleming and James Bond also proves he is highly skilled at creating an impossible-to-put-down thriller.<br /><br />Bond creator, was actually Commander Ian Fleming in Great Britain's Naval Intelligence Department during WW II. He was known as intelligence officer '17F' and much of 007's adventures were based on Fleming's exploits. Stevenson has exhaustively researched the subject and it shows in the book's detail. The pages are so filled with tension and authentic action it feels like you're watching a movie, which is no surprise since Stevenson is also the screenwriter of the upcoming movie Fleming.<br /><br />Operation Parsifal is an exciting read as we find ourselves in the 1945 when 17F is placed in the odd position of finding a way to stop an assassination plot against Hitler. In true Bond style, Fleming is paired with a gorgeous. Their adventures, spy-gadgets and exotic locales are once again reminiscent of the best 007 flicks. But this fast-paced, edgy, well written book is so much fun you won't want to wait for the movie. It's a must read for Bond lover, or anyone who jus loves action, suspense, mystery and thrillers!

B0001LJC2K|5.0|BUY THE CD it is less expensive than the mp3s and comes with an instant download of the mp3s. This is one of my favorite albums, it has both &#34;hysteria&#34; and &#34;Stockholm syndrome&#34; whats there to loose?
B000O59AFC|5.0|Great movie to have the picture and audio quality is great and its part of a great series and its one of the best movies of the series and of its time.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|I love Muse and this album, buy the CD, it comes with instant MP3 downloads for less than the cost of the MP3s
B001TH16DI|5.0|My favorite series to have on bluray, the only downside is that it only contains the theatrical versions on of the director's cut that the dvd's have.  The picture and audio is great upgrade though so there is an upside.
B0027MJU00|4.0|At first, I wasn't sure I would really like this book. I have read a few of Gillian Flynn's books and have had my head stuck in everyone of them!! The way this book started off, I wasn't sure I would really get into this book or even like it. But I must say this is my favorite Gillian Flynn book now!!! My favorite was Gone Girl, which was the first book that introduced me to Flynn. I recommend this one!! It's a great read, had me guessing a few different things a few times. I didn't see it coming!!
B004EPZ07U|4.0|It's a good movie, especially the extended version because it has more details from the theatrical version that I thought it would of made the movie better in theaters.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|i love surprise endings! with a movie about magic, everything is a surprise. i wached it twice in a row because i wanted my fiance to see it too
B000NTPDSW|5.0|May I say more from the headline, the picture and audio restoration they did on this series in fantastic, if you have the Dvd version get rid of them sell them on amazon and get this restoration collection.
B00DBQ0E2E|4.0|This is a good album.  I really liked their previous singer but Noora is fabulous too, which leads to my only knock on this album. The band can certainly rock. Songs are all good to excellent, band musicianship and vocals excellent, new singer is a rare gem, but the mix is lacking.  Noora's vocals are buried too far down in the mix. It really detracts from the overall musical experience and album's impact. A better mix could have really propelled this album and the band further forward.  This band is often spoken of as being in the same heavy metal genre as Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. But those bands make it a point not to hide or bury their good lead vocals. What makes them great is the complete blend of musical talent, songs and strong vocals. If you listen to Judas Priest or Iron Maiden, and most other famous rock bands and compare the mix, I think you would agree. It has nothing to do with the style of music; it's a band members' thing usually. A band should be just that, all out there together. I liked the album enough to buy it anyway but I sincerely hope they come out with a better remixed version soon
B009JBZH54|5.0|Chris Nolan take on the Batman franchise has been a refresh and awesome in depth of acting to action and story telling that its a great trilogy and not to have it would be a waste and its a space saver from having each individual movie and it comes with the special features if you had the seperatly also.  So you are getting your moneys worth.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a great hidden treasure game with a few twists. Added puzzles such as blocks add to the fun!
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Its a great movie of a great series and its definite one of the best movie of the series and the year.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This is one of the all time great tv series.  It took months to get this, but I guess that is because it was not realeased right after the third season was over.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|Its a great movie one of the best sci-fi of it's time with a great cast all around.  The action is awesome.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this app but sometimes it shuts off by itself. Other than that, I enjoy playing on my tablet. It looks so realistic I love it so much
B002M9WW30|5.0|It's one of the most spectacular series around in the movie world, and its a space saver too if you have them individual and the picture and audio quality is amazing.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This was agreat Science Fiction series.  Loved all episodes.  The characters are well developed thru the show.  A must watch for any Sci-Fi lover.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|It's a good movie its not bad.  Its a good movie to watch on a sunday and watch the U.S. Navy beat aliens trying to invade Earth.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey, you're an amazing writer.<br /><br />It's difficult today to find a entirely new and interesting world in a book. So many books are written, so many worlds are designed, and so many concepts are created and reused. Granted, there are some themes of this book that are common across a lot of post-apocalyptic fiction, such as controlled populations, safe havens, law & order, the &#34;outside&#34;, an unknown but controlling &#34;Big Brother&#34; sort, but there are a lot of instances where it just turns on its head.<br /><br />[Spoiler!]<br />Take Holston for instance. We assume as he leaves the silo that everyone has been lied to, and that the world is probably well on the way to recovery. Sure enough, his initial view purports to confirm everything we expected; he sees green grass, blue skies, and towering skyscrapers in the distance. We say to ourselves, &#34;Well, I expected that!&#34;. Then Mr. Howey turns it upside down and reveals that the control of Big Brother is far, far more pervasive than we had anticipated and that Holston isn't seeing the real devastated world after all (it isn't shown until Shift 3 what actually killed Holston). It's masterful. It's amazing.<br /><br />The characters are strong and stick to their personalities, as they should. Everyone is clearly someone else, and not a single personality playing multiple faces. The world is tantalizing and you can feel like you're seeing it through their eyes. Your mood will swing from one allegiance to another as more and more of the political and psychological reasons behind the way the Silo works is revealed. You learn quickly that not everything is good and not everything is bad.<br /><br />I loved all 5 stories and eagerly purchased Shift right after (and will grab Dust the second I finish Shift). As you read through the next section it'll help confirm some of the things happening in the first five, showing Howey to either be writing from a well-thought out base for his world or be really, really good at tying things together last minute.<br /><br />You won't regret reading this series. I highly bet it will be one of the books you'll remember for decades to come.ly, really good at tying things together last minute.<br /><br />You won't regret reading this series. I highly bet it will be one of the books you'll remember for decades to come.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|Its a great prequel to a great tv series, its a must have, it may be short in episodes but have lots of details of the characters of how they come to be in the series.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|This was the only book I read all the way through in high school so I was pretty excited to watch it. I forgot how sad the ending was, though. I love Leonardo Dicaprio! He did a fantastic job as Gatsby, I thought. All the actors did a really great job at bringing their characters to life. All in all, I really liked it!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I had no previous knowledge of what life was like in prison. I found it fascinating to read about the bonds made between women, the alliances and respect and kindness that was shown.  Many of these women could have been helped by counselors or family ties.  Rather than helping women, we, as a government choose to incarcerate and ignore.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I had high hopes. I liked the beginning but I really did not like the plot that the secret was about. I did like the ending that noted what would have happened.
B0089EHWQE|2.0|The little girl Zoe was very annoying.  Had to skip over anything she said.  If read the line, &#34;Little girls don't......&#34; one more time I may have shot myself.  Far fetched story.  Did not like it at all.
B00915G6SU|2.0|I don't watch this show anymore. Basically in order to understand why I only gave it two stars it is important to stress the following:<br /><br />I have a deep respect for the USA System of Justice. No matter how serious is the accusation, a suspect always has the right to a fair trial.<br /><br />And that is the reason why I used the word \\"disturbing\\": in Criminal Minds, the FBI agents are at the same time, Cops, Judge, Jurors and Executioner. These agents always killed the suspect. The concept of Fair Trial, which is so important in the USA System of Justice is basically absent. After several episodes I started to fear both the FBI Agents and the Suspects.<br /><br />This being said, Criminal Minds, as a show, is well done: actors are good, the plot development is clever, etc. But my problem remains: because I respect so much USA System of Justice is painful to watch police agents being judges, jurors and executioners all at the same time. That is all.<br /><br />Obviously, for Criminal Minds fans this is not relevant because the show is good the way it is. My point of view is strictly personal and highly influenced by my personal respect for USA System of Justice. That is all.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|I like most everything that Josh Groban has produced and this album is no exception I am glad that he made another.
B002XXNSF6|2.0|Waste of time.  Hopefully this trilogy will improve.  I couldn't believe I wasted my time on this .  Won't happen again!
0399226907|4.0|i bought it based on the review. when the book is here, my kid loves to flip the page seeing caterpillar moving from one hole to another hole. she feel excited and now she can tell me one apple, 2 plums!
B001SKB1Y0|4.0|The movie had a good storyline and characters were interesting, but  it just got a little manic toward the end. What more would you expect from Woody Allen?
1936719118|4.0|I liked most of the principles and the way they were presented.  If I have one critique it's that the author oversimplifies things a bit. &#34;Just do it the way you want.&#34;  All in all, it's a good message.  Just read between the lines.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|This is perfect exactly what I needed and I would recommend this product to all.  It came faster than expected and perfect condition. A MUST BUY!!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno Mars is an unbelievable talent.  I find this collection of songs upbeat and/or relaxing, depending on the song.  This CD does have a parental advisory warning as a few of the songs are not for children's ears.
B00471JSR4|5.0|This is perfect exactly what I needed and I would recommend this product to all.  It came faster than expected and perfect condition. A MUST BUY!!
B00DW39B2K|1.0|Ridiculous. I'm not sure what was more embarrassing, Travolta's performance or the fact that I paid actual money to watch it.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|This is perfect exactly what I needed and I would recommend this product to all.  It came faster than expected and perfect condition. A MUST BUY!!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun and addicting game. Daily tourney locks up and freezes a lot. Don't always receive awards when this happens.  Very frustrating but still keep playing.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This is perfect exactly what I needed and I would recommend this product to all.  It came faster than expected and perfect condition. A MUST BUY!!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Now You See Me was a true breakout hit of the summer. A fantastic cast, bringing some of their best work, meshed with an excellent heist movie plot and good cinematography really elevates this above the rest. In particular, Jesse Eisenburg and Woody Harrelson are back from Zombieland and have even better chemistry here than there, but all four of the Horsemen are stellar. Watch this movie! You'll be surprised and amazed in equal measure, and I guarantee the climax will catch you off guard!
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|This is perfect exactly what I needed and I would recommend this product to all.  It came faster than expected and perfect condition. A MUST BUY!!
B004GFN11A|4.0|Overall this Wordpress app works great and has no problems. Would be perfect if you were a photo blogger and used your phone as a camera. If you're a Wordpress developer like me, there isn't really that much customization you can do to the Wordpress site from the app. It's mainly for bloggers/site owners.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|This is perfect exactly what I needed and I would recommend this product to all.  It came faster than expected and perfect condition. A MUST BUY!!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Can not put it down once I start playing this game, so much to do, so many Windows to unlock. Just love it.

B00BWRKVVS|5.0|This is perfect exactly what I needed and I would recommend this product to all.  It came faster than expected and perfect condition. A MUST BUY!!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Such an incredible show! It only gets more and more addicting. Also, make sure you don't get too attached to any one character...just sayin!
B004K58GSO|5.0|If you love the Duke, you'll love this movie. James Caan's performance as Mississippi is very good and Mitchum as the drunken sherrif is also good. The deputy is a classic player from the 50's and 60s. Watch it you'll love it.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|Really need to watch the one before it, Casino Royale first for this to make much sense.  Product came on time and in good shape.
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|I lasted 15 minutes into this film and it was ridiculous story and seemed to be just a loose story line to attach blood, mean people and thoughtless &#34;good&#34; guys together.  I love the Die Hards, so violence isn't something I shrink from...but it has to have substantial heroes with some morality and a hint of honor.  Good grief this movie was gross.
B00BEYYO8U|5.0|Lots of action.  Daniel Craig.  James Bond.  Explosions, fires and gunfights - what do you expect.  Good movie.  The last two before it left you waiting for the movie arch to finish.  This movie tied up all the strings (or killed off the characters) and left you with a clean slate for the next movie.
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|Really enjoyed this fine-feathered film.  I'm not going out on a limb to say the characters are fun and full-featured with just the right contrast in age, motivation and background to makes their interaction very interesting.  The settings are beautifully photographed and the whole subject is so informative and educational regarding the birds that populate, propagate and pollinate our avian country.  Fun, no foul, only fowl language; so even good for families.  Plus, fashion addicts will love the dapper dress of one main character in particular, matched only by the brilliant and subtle plumage of the birds themselves...high-flying entertainment!
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|This book was brilliant in the way it gave insight to a completely self-absorbed person and how her mind justifies the way she behaves. I've never really read that in a book before and it was a real eye opener. The book was funny, sweet and she ultimately grew up and redeemed herself by expanding her thinking past herself. I had to keep my chuckling pretty quiet on my commuter train at 6 am, when I got home I was able to laugh a lot louder. Excellent book!
0142000655|5.0|I didn't know exactly what I was getting into when I started this book, and I'm glad that I didn't. This book was written by a man who was no short of a genius. Don't pick this book up unless you are ready to gain a profound clarification of human nature at it's best and worst. It's one of those books that can fluctuate your mood, and keep you an introvert for longer than you intended.
B000W8HC8I|1.0|Nothing that can be learn or thought from this it just full of fairy tales or sex and drug. Shouldn't have categories under investing book more a sex novel probably.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|SEAson 4 is just as good as the other 3. Im so glad this is on Prime.<br />Its a must watch.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love everything about it but I have had to uninstall it and then install it several times because it freezes up...
B00ET47USI|5.0|Plays just like original.. can be addictive and time flies by.<br />Don`t like when game places cards for me but 2 suites is a better challenge.
B008469DGY|3.0|You don't have to be a golf buff or even like golf to play this one. I don't know how long my like for the game will last. It isn't a piece of cake. I hate when I play a few rounds and can lap up any board ... that becomes boring. There are other reasons why it becomes monotonous, but the board selection! is not one of them. Try it if you like a challenge. It gets 3 stars for lack of ingenuity.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|The caveat under the code for download is that it may be expired if you download it AFTER the first day it is on sale in stores.  Happily, with a few hours to spare, the first attempt to download works fine and that's really the bonus feature that matters to me otherwise I would have paid three dollars less and gotten the basic copy since I don't have Blu-Ray playability.<br /><br />I would never buy for or use an ultraviolet copy download because when I did use it just the once, I \\"successfully downloaded\\" but was refused viewing because MY copy was busy.  I never got to watch it but of course, now my hard drive is contaminated and accessed as a result.
B00942S4OY|5.0|My daughter loves it.  She is a huge fan from this band.  And the boys are amazing.  It's good music.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|I remember the original version of this movie so that I wasn't really expecting too much from this version. However, I was pleasantly surprised. It really held my interest, the acting. plot, and special effects were well done. It did not feel like a B movie.
1577312082|5.0|A friend gave this to me as a gift- I was very skeptical. I listened to the cds in my car and can honestly say it has transformed my life. I am starting to learn how to &#34;be the watcher&#34; and not be a slave to my mind. So grateful I gave this a chance. I have since passed it on to another friend. I 100% recommend this.
B007N85POS|5.0|This was for my 10 year old son. Apparently he loves this game. No more can be said by me.
B003UMW62A|5.0|This is a family fun movie you can watch with your children of wife and have a good laughs i recommend this movie to any one thats looking for a family fun night.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|Loaded quick and responsive, great to view a show with no commercials or speed it up when you want to skip a section
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|The quality of this Blu-ray picture and audio is unacceptable!  I cannot believe this is not a bad batch of product being shipped.<br />I've seen better HD-quality video of this concert on YouTube!<br /><br />Oh and the cover-art looks like it was done by one of Madonna's kids.  That's just as bad.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|It's the Alien series. What more can I say. I like Alien and Aliens the best. But, the upgrade to Blu-Ray really makes them look all look great on my LED TV.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I watch the tv show and the comic puts a fine line between the show and the book. The book has a nice twist and is different from the story on tv. I love it
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|What a great continuation of the Star Trek series. I saw it at the movies and wanted the DVD for my collection. The Digital Copy is already on my iPad.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This is the best of the three books there is so much action and I am glad that it ended the way it did
B004JN1D2I|4.0|The story is wonderfully compelling.  Even after watching the series, I am just as enthralled in the book version.  But, every once in awhile, I start a new chapter to find that punctuation is seriously lacking.  It slows down the reading process while I read everything carefully to ensure that I'm attributing the words and thoughts to the proper character.<br /><br />Thankfully, the editing issues only effect a few short chapters and are easily overcome with mindful diligence.<br /><br />This issue should be addressed by the publisher.  I cannot imagine that it would be very difficult to fix.
B00CDXOXB4|1.0|I always enjoy a good drama love story film.  I had a free rental code available, so I figured what the heck.  This movie had the potential to be outstanding!  Good lead actors, good cinematography, excellent location, decent story.  The best way to describe it was that it simply lacked substance.  It was like an old, lazy Lifetime TV movie.  Nothing exciting.  And because of that, it was extremely slow.  Particularly the first 30 minutes and then again in the middle of the film.  The plot was just too weak for me.  Also there were no good support roles (because the plot was so weak), so it was just lacking any sort of flow.  I think that hurt the film dramatically, just not enough happening to engage the viewer.  And some of the scenes just didn't flow well, and weren't done at the appropriate times, particularly when they kept cutting back to the drunken husband.  Personally if it's a rainy, cold day and you have nothing to do, you MIGHT want to watch this.  Otherwise, there are much better films to watch.  Disappointment.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is a simple quick one touch play that works smoothly and quickly to pass the time and stimulate your mind. BEST ONE I've found.
B00DNDR29I|5.0|I am in LOVE with this incredibly underrated artist! Janelle is truly someone different and much needed in a market full of manufactured so called \\"talent\\". Her sounds, her writing, messages, beauty... everything is there in this small package! I really love that fact that she is not afraid to take risks and challenge her listeners to hear something different, true Artistry here!!! My Top 5:<br /><br />1. Give Em' What they Love w/ Prince - ... And I've been loving this from the first listen!! Prince was perfect for this song and they mesh well together. Im addicted!<br /><br />2. Q.U.E.E.N w/Erykah Badu - I loved this from the first listen and what better way to get a woman's message out better than having the always awesome Erykah Badu! The beat is crazy and the video is just as amazing! LOVE THIS!<br /><br />3. Dance Apocalyptic - Love this very catchy funky song. Im glad she used this as the second single but the one with Prince needs to be the third single!<br /><br />4. Dorothy Dandridge Eyes w/ Esperanza Spalding - Beautiful, jazzy, 80s sounding song! Love everything about it!<br /><br />5. It's Code - I love the 60s Motown sound with this one. Sounds like Raphael Saadiq produced this song.
B00ENBS4GO|5.0|Great season. it would have been nice to have some more at the end dealing with pompei and the aftermath
B003H4I4JU|5.0|After I read the first book, I was hooked. This one was a very fast read, because it is so interesting. The characters were not flat, but developed nicely. The story was not predictable, which I really like. I can't wait for book three.
B001NFNFIK|5.0|It was great seeing this book come to life as a movie..Aside from the stars, LeVon Helm<br />Is in it and also James Gammon, two great character actors who have since passed away.The only<br />Person missing is Cletus<br />and if you are a<br />true fan of James Lee Burke you know exactly who<br />I mean.A James Lee Burke adaptation without<br />Clete is like a day without moonshine.It's<br />still a not to be missed film.
B003CHGV74|5.0|Excellent series, character dynamics, and just an overall great show. Storyline is supurb and the entire series is extremely well done :). Very entertaining from beginning to end! Not for people that are sensitive to language or some violence but it's easily overlooked because the show is so well done.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|The movie itself is fantastic - beautifully shot, excellent effects that aren't too over the top and don't detract from the story or the experience. What I really disliked was the soundtrack and the overall score. It just doesn't sit well with me when you are pairing Jay-Z, Beyonce, and Rhianna with such a period-specific movie like this. If you could remove that music and replace it with music from that era I think it would have been perfect. That's just my opinion.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|Excellent series, character dynamics, and just an overall great show. Storyline is supurb and the entire series is extremely well done :). Very entertaining from beginning to end! Not for people that are sensitive to language or some violence but it's easily overlooked because the show is so well done.
B00AESN8XY|1.0|I bought the game but when I tried opening it, it won't let me it kept telling me that I didn't own it, but when I clicked see details it told me I could open it, waste of money for android
B00BEXB18M|3.0|More Megadeth. If your a fan you&#34;ll like it. If you listen to them you&#34;ll say &#34;sounds like their last couple. Good cd.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|So good but so sad!!!  I'm literally crying right now, the ending was that sad! Well written but awfully sad!
B00DCRE83S|5.0|Heavy metal music. Just like the title says. Get it if you like heavy metal music. Newsted didn&#34;t disappoint on this.
B008MM9630|5.0|Very cute!! Nice game to waste time......very cute graphics.  Would be a great game for kids too. A+ + + + + +
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love this device. It costs $35. It is ridiculously easy to setup. No, really...it costs $35. You can stream anything from your Chrome browser to your TV. I'm not lying...it costs $35. It can also stream video from several apps on your phone/tablet. Seriously, it costs $35. It has yet to fail or crash on me. Yup, still costs $35. Why wouldn't you buy this?
0385528752|5.0|The book switch was very inspiring to me, however I didn't read the book. It happened sort of like a accident some might say. I was eating candy bars and junk food on holloween night and out a no where the book switch feel on my head knocking me out and it turned on the switch in brain that told me the sense of eating right. So when I eat more and more food than get hit, I give that food up. Oh and the saddest part about it is that one day I was eating a blizzard and the book hit. I was weeping cause I can't eat it anymore so in a way I got very emotional. Well I hope this review was fun to read, I hoped it might of helped some people out. [...]
B009WO7NQO|2.0|Once again, get an update for kindle and it crashes every time. once again, the likely only solution will be uninstalling and reinstalling and resetting all my scores.
B00136Q4P0|5.0|I've been listening to MJ since my folks was putting me to sleep and making me dance w/ his vinyls.  MJ did so much work and so many collaborations it's impossible to capture it on one, two, or three disc.  It's a full time job to make a mix CD b/c you can't really decide what songs you want.  MJ music captured so many emotions and was innovative, he always came with something new, but most importantly he always tried new things with music and sound... places I thought, people thought music couldn't go.  For me personally, I think this captures the past present and future of MJ from my personal perspective.  Guarantee people won't agree, like I said before touched everyone, so I'm sure everybody has their own particular sound of MJ.  Rest in peace.
B000W93CHC|4.0|Not as awesome as the first in the series; &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34;, but definitely an excellent read.  Once you get into it, you won't be able to put it down.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I'm not so heavy into alternative I'm mostly R&B, Jazz, and soundtrack scores.  But this group's music has depth, every song lyrics catches you.  For me it's &#34;Demons&#34;, something everyone struggles with, but the lyrics are just capturing.  All the songs were A+, you can count me as a fan.  Won't see me at the concerts, but you'll definitely catch me raising an eyebrow if someone talks smack about this group.  So far it seems the group has a bright future.  Only thing I have to this group don't forget your foundation guys, I know music has to change, but why you love it never has to.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|love love love this movie.<br /><br />the condition it arrived in was flawless: (brand new, still in the packaging, not damaged from shipping at all!), and was a very reasonable price for the quality of this film.<br /><br />i would HIGHLY recommend it!
B00ESY77LO|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie, a bit different than what I was expecting but well done! Great acting, good character development!
B0040ZA2D6|5.0|Fun, youthful, cd.  Don't mind my 8 yr old listening to it and I can tolerate it too. (A little too well).
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Its just a standard Micro USB cable.  I don't know if its worth paying $10 for it but the cable feels thicker and has a nice (almost velvety) plastic cover.  The USB and Micro USB ends feel solid and doesn't feel like it will fall apart.  Its a good cable.<br /><br />The cheap chinese made ones you buy for $1 will probably fall apart.  I know some of the ones I bought have.<br /><br />The cheap ones probably cost pennies to make but this one definitely is of higher quality and probably costs them a good 15 cents (not including the box, but the box is nice).  Not a bad markup.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|A Feast for Crows kept me wanting more. Truly more detail on some of the lesser characters that to me give credence to the main characters. A wonderful read!! Enjoy JWE!!! You will love it :-)
B004I2K4DY|2.0|I watched this once and it was painful and not a good as the 10th anniversary concert performance, mainly due to the casting of Nick Jonas.  All I could think while watching this is how painful it must have been for the rest of the cast to have him cast a Marius.  I guess it was done with the idea of appealing to teenage girls and getting them to urge their parents to buy tickets to the show.  He was definately the weak link in this production.  I still prefer the 10th anniversary production.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a game that quiets you down after a very busy day!  I love and need that!  Thank you for the Kindle tablet edition.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! I purchased it after viewing it on cable just one time. Adam Sandler does a great job as Dracula and the rest of the cast are just as wonderful. The characters are just so lovable and the movie is hilarious. I recommend this for the whole family. I find this movie to be another gem like Meet the Robinsons and Despicable Me.

B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Harry Hole is told  by the Sydney police chief that he is merely an observer in the investigation of a murdered Norwegian girl in Sydney. The first half of the book kind of meanders around with lots of red herrings (no pun intended) but the action picks up in the second half. It is a great introduction to the Harry Hole character but the reader needs to be patient.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|I watched this movie at the recommendation of a friend after we kept hearing one of the songs that the &#34;group&#34; sang.<br /><br />I had been told that it was a good movie, but it was really a great movie.<br /><br />And the music in it was great as well!<br /><br />R/S<br /><br />David A.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I've wanted a device like the Chromecast for a while. I have a Roku, Apple TV, and of course several consoles but none of these compare to the simplicity of the Chromecast. The best part about this device is the integration with your phone or tablet, and depending on how you have it hooked up, it can even automatically turn on your TV or Stereo so you can start up music right from your phone in any room.<br /><br />I was pretty surprised at just how good the Netflix video quality was, especially compared to my PlayStation 3. So that was a definite bonus. Highly recommended.

B00D2BHO44|4.0|It's a more emotional and slow paced soundtrack than your typical video game soundtrack, but overall it's great background music.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I found this story to be extremely interesting and suspenseful. I enjoyed trying to figure out how the plot would evolve. The only negative aspect for me was kind of a quick explanation at the end of how this was all possible.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|I think this is designed for touch/tap typing, but it also supports &#34;swipe&#34; typing.  Both of them work well.  I'm not a huge fan of a couple style decisions (it puts a space after slashes for example).  Still faster and more accurate than any other android keyboard I've used.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book was a real page turner. It had everything I like mystery, adventure, and some romance. Anybody who like these things should read this book.

B009JZSC9S|5.0|I am hooked. I save up each season and watch them after the season is over. Start from Season 1. It's like a mini-soap.
B008133MDK|5.0|So, I only watched this because I saw Star Trek and was instantly a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch. Now I am an even bigger fan and totally hooked on the show. Cannot wait for season three. This one is worth owning and watching repeatedly. Funny creepy sexy smart and full of really nuanced performances. A++
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Loved this movie it was excellent...ppl keep saying that they don't understand it very much or it doesn't go along with the Alien movies.  It's hard to say if it really is a prequel although there are some things that do measure up to it being one...it just might be a a new series in the \\"Alien\\" franchise from director Ridley Scott...but i could be wrong.<br /><br />In one of the commentaries on (chapter 33) just before Janeck and the 2 other crew memebers crash Prometheus into the Engineer space craft, Ridley Scott says, the intro of the movie takes place about 10 million years prior to Prometheus ever landing on the planet.<br /><br />Although LV-223 and LV-426 are in the same solar system and are adjacent to each other, they still share no common ground for the basis of the movie.  Similarities are quite noticeable just like the Xenomorphs from previous Alien movies and the Deacon (proto-morph) from \\"Prometheus\\".<br /><br />Yes the Engineer space craft(Croissant) was in the first Alien film and and you can also see the dead Engineer, but the only purpose of that was to show how the Engineer either failed to complete his mission from LV-223(90AD)...crashes on LV-426 or was just a victim from they're own bio-weapon which would ultimately be discovered by the Nostromo ship/crew (Ellen Ripley) in 2122AD.<br /><br />Prometheus lands on LV-223 in 2093AD to find themselves in a bad predicament, they find and awake an Engineer who was sleeping for 2000yrs in hyper sleep...he tends to carry out the plan that the last Engineer couldnt do, of fully eradicating the human species or anything and anyone inferior to them for that matter.
B00ARF92HK|3.0|It put me to sleep...not the worst movie I've ever seen.  Just doesn't hold up to the original Judge Dredd.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|Bought this movie at Best Buy on its release, movie is excellent saw it in theaters in IMAX 3D I was blown away by the visuals and sound.  I would've like to purchase this movie in 3D but i do not own a 3d tv but i plan on buying one soon.<br /><br />The picture transfer to blu-ray could have been more better in my opinion, Star Trek 2009 to me looks alot better on blu-ray as apposed to this one... I know its not going to be IMAX quality, although its still an excellent movie and the Dolby DTS 7.1 HD is still great.<br /><br />I really hope there's another Star Trek movie in the near future, because these past 2 movies are great..J.J. Abrams will be working on the new Star Wars episode 7 movie...so I'm guessing when thats done, he'll start a new one

B00ECUARO8|5.0|A strong performance from Matthew McConaughey in the title role, Mud offers an engaging Southern drama that manages to stay on track.

B0049VVE7Y|4.0|It starts out kind of slow and takes a few episodes to get into it, but it is worth watching because the show really picks up steam in season 2 and is phenomenal in season 3.
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|Sta Trek-into Darkness(released April/13)is a bitter disappointment from the first of this new series of Star Trek films.This one stars,among others,Chris Pine as Captain James T. Kirk,Zachary Quinto as Spock,Zoe Saldana as Lieutenant Uhura,Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan,Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy,Simon Pegg as Scotty,John Cho as Sulu,and Peter Weller as Fleet Admiral Alexander Marcus.The film has that old debilitating film trait of wanting to do far too much within a certain time frame.And that 133 minute time frame unfortunately wears very heavily on the viewer.<br />The story finds the Enterprise crew on a far distant planet violating the prime directive.Kirk and Scotty flee from a primitive tribe,trying to steal a precious scroll.They in turn have to jump off a high cliff into water,and re board the Enterprise.The ship,in turn,rises out of the water in front of the tribesmen and Spock almost gets killed setting off a device which prevents the total annihilation of the planet.Back on Earth,Kirk gets his ship taken away from him by Capt.Pike,his mentor.Kirk is made 2nd officer,while Spock is transferred.<br />Meanwhile a \\"terrorist\\" has set off a terrible explosion in London,destroying a top secret Federation area called Section 31(we have heard of this in DS9).While at a meeting of top Federation captains with the fleet Admiral(discussing the terrorist act)they get attacked(a set up),and Capt.Pike is killed.The \\"terrorist\\" is identified as an agent from Section 31,and Kirk volunteers to bring the man back,who has fled to the Klingon home world.The Admiral tells Kirk to take along 72 new style photon torpedoes with him.He wants Kirk to launch them from the Neutral Zone to the uninhabited area where the fugitive is,and come home.The Admirals daughter accompanies him,but Scotty resigns in the process,sensing danger.<br />While en route to Kronos,Spock repeatedly reminds Kirk of the immorality of his orders.In the end Kirk relents and agrees to head an away mission to Kronos to capture the fugitive.When the team arrives on Kronos they are soon after set upon by a Klingon patrol.However the fugitive they seek appears to be helping them to defeat the Klingons.When the action calms down he unexpectedly surrenders to Kirk and is thrown in the brig.It is there that the man identifies himself as Khan,a 300 year old genetically superior being from Earth.The \\"torpedoes\\" the Enterprise carries are actually cryo tubes,containing the rest of his original crew.Spock contacts his older self,who informs him,among other things,that Kahn was the most dangerous adversary the Enterprise ever faced.<br />On the way home,the Enterprise is confronted by a top secret Federation ship commanded by Admiral Marcus.They end up stopped above Earth.Admiral Marcus,we find out,was the one who awoke Kahn in order to possibly glean information that might help the Federation in future battles with its enemies.However it back fired and Kahn went rogue.Now the Admiral is going to destroy the Enterprise.Scotty has infiltrated the Admirals ship and disabled its' power,just as The Admiral was about to deliver the coup de' gras on the Enterprise.While they scurry about trying to get their weapons up and running,Kirk and Kahn board them.They seize the bridge,but Kahn turns on them and kills the Admiral.Kirk,Scotty and the Admirals daughter are beamed back to the Enterprise.There,Kirk is forced to hand over the cryo tubes.However Spock has armed the torpedoes and removed the bodies.They blow the ship up and it and Kahn go down towards Earth,just missing the disabled Enterprise,which itself starts to fall out of Earth's orbit.<br />The anti matter reactor is totally off line and Kirk,in desperation,enters the reactor core to manually re align the reactor.This results in Kirks death,as Spock looks on.Meanwhile Kahns ship has plunged into San Fransisco,but Kahn still survives.The Enterprise scans,detects Kahns whereabouts,and Spock rushes to capture him.Just as Spock is aboutto deal a death blow to Kahn,Uhura shows up telling Spock to stop.They apparently need his super DNA to repair Kirk.Kirk is indeed revived and a year later is lead speaker commemorating Capt.Pike's death and commencing the Enterprise's new five year mission.<br />I think this time shift/change has really got to me.The sight of a Kahn that looks and sounds like a student of Cambridge University in England,instead of someone with a distinct Latino heritage(played by Ricardo Montalban,on TV AND in films),really,REALLY bugs me.Time shift or not,I think there should have been at least had SOME resemblance physically and in demeanour.I also almost laughed out loud when they recreated the Spock death scene from Star Trek 2,but in reverse,with Kirk dying instead.Now I just shake my head.What also put the nail in the proverbial coffin with this scene was Spock yelling \\"Kahhhhhhhn\\" aftewards.Give...me...a...break! How totally UN-believable a thing that was and a slap in the face to the entire Star Trek cannon.I also do NOT understand why they needed Kahn's DNA to bring back Kirk.They had 72 different tubes to work with,all filled with super beings with roughly the same super DNA.Any one of them would have done the trick.Right?<br />Not only do those points and others make me de-mark this film,but it's meandering plot is all over the galaxy.This film was far,far too ambitious and was trying to fit too much within the space of one film.The good things? I think the new actors portraying Kirk,Spock,et al,are starting to fit nicely into their roles and it was great to see Leonard Nimoy back again,if only for a few seconds.The explosions and fight scenes are all good...maybe even too good.They certainly are designed to hide this film's weaknesses.Which is harder to do than hitting a Gorn at two miles with a phaser rifle.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.There are no extra features on this DVD at all.<br />All in all a BIG let down from the first Abrams epic.I can only say the producers of this new line of films better beware of what Star Trek cannon they climb all over before they start pounding it into new ones.I KNOW this is a new time line,I get it Mr.Abrams.Pike wasn't supposed to die here,in the reality we know,he lived.I can understand that.But hey,a Kahn that no more resembles the original in any way,shape or form than I do...time change or no,that is wrong.And the role reversal with Kirks death instead of Spock....it was not poignant or good,just laughable.This is a film that is less than the sum of its parts.Lesson learned,so let's move on to a better(I hope)third Star Trek installment.And remember...I'll be watching.to deal a death blow to Kahn,Uhura shows up telling Spock to stop.They apparently need his super DNA to repair Kirk.Kirk is indeed revived and a year later is lead speaker commemorating Capt.Pike's death and commencing the Enterprise's new five year mission.<br />I think this time shift/change has really got to me.The sight of a Kahn that looks and sounds like a student of Cambridge University in England,instead of someone with a distinct Latino heritage(played by Ricardo Montalban,on TV AND in films),really,REALLY bugs me.Time shift or not,I think there should have been at least had SOME resemblance physically and in demeanour.I also almost laughed out loud when they recreated the Spock death scene from Star Trek 2,but in reverse,with Kirk dying instead.Now I just shake my head.What also put the nail in the proverbial coffin with this scene was Spock yelling \\"Kahhhhhhhn\\" aftewards.Give...me...a...break!

B00CLL1UY6|5.0|The novel \\"Sebastian\\" by Christoph Fischer opens with an exciting setting, Vienna in the last few years of its Golden Age that ended with the outbreak of World War I.  Austria was one of the most progressive places in Europe and its intellectual capital, with such famous thinkers and artists as Sigmund Freud, Gustav Klimt, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Stefan Zweig.  On the surface, it felt like a modern city of progressive thought, but there existed a strong undercurrent of cultural, racial, and social tension. And that tension quickly comes to the surface in Christoph Fischer's story of Sebastian Schreiber, the only son of what looks like a well-assimilated Jewish family.<br /><br />The story opens with Sebastian suffering dire consequences of a minor accident - amputation of his leg.  With Sebastian not being able to help as much around the house or in the family-owned grocery shop, his parents are looking to hire an assistant. And that's where some of these hidden tensions come to the fore. When the family is debating whether Ingeborg, their current assistant, should stay on, the following exchange between them is telling of these tensions:<br /><br />\\"Has she agreed to stay on... Wasn't there a problem with her family because we are Jews?\\"<br />\\"...she wants to stay on. She doesn't mind one bit. The eastern Jews still scare her but people like us; she said she wouldn't know the difference.\\"<br /><br />And that's just the beginning of the conflict. The novel is fiction, but these tensions are quite real. While Austria at the time could brag about all the Jewish intelligentsia flourishing in Vienna, there were clear limits to what the Jews could do.  One notable example is Sigmund Freud who started his career in academic medicine but had to abandon it partly because his Jewish background was a disadvantage.  The election of Karl Lueger, a politician with strong anti-Semitic views, as Vienna's mayor was another strike against Austria's Jewish population.  A notorious Austrian (at least Austrian by birth) publicly admired Karl Lueger's anti-Jewish tirades and actions, adding to the conflict. Who was that admirer? None other than Adolf Hitler. And we all know where that story led.<br /><br />As I read this novel, I couldn't help but think that the dramatic opening of the novel, with an amputation of a young man's leg, set the tone and the symbolism for the rest of the novel. Just like Sebastian had to  \\"get used to the new way of moving around,\\" Austria had to find its the new way of navigating the changing landscape of World War I era Europe.<br /><br />An enlightening and engaging novel. Highly recommended.ustrian (at least Austrian by birth) publicly admired Karl Lueger's anti-Jewish tirades and actions, adding to the conflict. Who was that admirer? None other than Adolf Hitler.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Interesting story of people who's lives who are intertwined, and have to live with the choices they made when they were still very young. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and can't wait to read another one of her books.
B00AEFY5B6|5.0|This is probably the most spectacular recreation on film, ever, of the ancient Roman Empire.  The camps of the Roman armies, the villas, the cities, all the detailed sets and costumes are awesomely real creations.  I've watched the movie twice and have liked it very well both times.  I've felt glad to be able to view such an outstanding SCENIC  treasure.  I think that's the Number One most excellent thing about the movie.  You truly feel as if you're there in the midst of the drama that's going on.<br /><br />The next very good thing about the movie is that it tells a very gripping story.  It includes much blood and gore of brutal combat, but there is a serious religious-spiritual theme that figures into the story as well.  The viewer sees the protagonist's sincere worship of pagan gods who are addressed in terms reminiscent of Christian worship, \\"Holy Mother\\" and \\"Holy Father.\\"  These seem to be tutelary spirits that the main character interweaves with his devoted love for his wife and son.  (No orgiastic pagan behavior here.)  One learns that among these pagan Romans, there is a belief in the afterlife.  There are concepts of \\"righteousness\\" in these ancient people that the viewer, as a modern conscientious person, can identify with.  Ultimately the movie is worthwhile and satisfying not only because the viewer responds to the immense courage of the \\"General,\\" the \\"Slave,\\" the \\"Gladiator,\\" but also to his tender love for his wife and son, and the mysterious promise offered of the future love reunion in \\"eternity.\\"<br /><br />As the story opens, General Maximus reminds his soldiers to fight under the motto of \\"Strength and Honor.\\"  He reminds them that \\"What we do in life echoes in eternity.\\"  After a long and successful campaign, all General Maximus wants is to get back Home, but his destiny is to keep fighting for the dream of his beloved Emperor, Marcus Aurelius, who wants to give back power to the people of Rome by ending  political corruption in the Senate.  The reinstatement of Republican integrity would rekindle the \\"Glory of the Empire,\\" the Great Light that had shone from pre-corrupt Rome.  Maximus ends up fighting to vindicate the murder of Aurelius by his ambitious and vicious son who jealously seizes power in place of the fatherly love he feels deprived of.  (You feel sorry for him but unfortunately he is apparently a really unlovable snake.)<br /><br />Eventually, the Roman Coliseum appears as a terrible Death pit.  And it's there that Maximus will seek to win his Freedom.  Because of his relationship with the Emperor's sister, and her relationship with a senator who seeks to restore a wholesome government, Maximus fights ultimately to restore Right rule to Rome.<br /><br />The most memorable thing for me about the movie was the way it depicted the near-death experience and then the final passage into the afterlife.  There was a door-gate which was the entrance; there was a big field of tall grass; there was the road that led to the villa that was \\"Home.\\"  Home, at last.<br /><br />All actors did great.  The casting choices of actors were excellent.<br /><br />As loaded as this film is with masculine contests, conflicts, and fights, I don't think any guys would complain that this movie is a \\"chick flick.\\"  It is chiefly the story of a Hero triumphing over great hardships and there is very little focus on his romantic life.  But the story will be interesting for males and females both.<br /><br />(I saw the 1999 VHS version.  There is a 2013 release, too.)

I decided a re-read was in order before my copy of Doctor Sleep arrives.<br /><br />For me, this was like a first reading.  I didn't remember a lot of it - it had been replaced in my brain by the movie.  Although the movie was great, the book is far superior.  Stephen King writes \\"visual descriptions\\" which you'll understand as you read.<br /><br />Even if you've read The Shining before, read it again.  Simply awesome.

B003N7GATM|5.0|The thing is, this is an EP, that means there is not much to say about it.<br />How to destroy angels is the band for you, if you like Nine Inch Nails (NIN)<br />It is as close, as you will ever get.<br />Why is that ?<br />because she is Trent Reznor`s wife.<br /><br />Personally i love this!  ive allways enjoyed the slower songs from NIN<br />and the 6 songs you get on this EP, is just that<br />The song : A drowning,  is perfect<br />ENJOY ^^

B00C5R8364|5.0|This is not only a well written action read, it's also a good story, and imparts a lot of current information on the world of arab terror.  You will not go wrong with this author
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I really like this game.. very fun<br /> I recremed this game.. fun for boys or girls. keeps attention for a lone time.
0345803485|1.0|Where to begin - the writing is poor & repetitive. Certain aspects of the plot are highly suspect.  This book seems highly narcissitic - open any page and count how many times the word I & we are used. A review on Goodreads finds striking similarities between this book and the Twilight series.  Not having read Twilight I cannot confirm this theory.  However, what I can confirm is that I won't bother finishing this book.
1401235425|5.0|This is a great Batman story, I wasn't sure if I would like the new 52 or not but it is looking like Scott Snyder is shaping up to be this generations Alan Moore. This story gives an interesting history on Gotham city with the Wayne family and of course the court of owls.
B006S8Q8W2|4.0|This is a remake of a Japanese movie.  It relies on some stereotypic characters, but it's a nice story about a man who wants passion in his life.  Some nice dancing, too.
1490313370|5.0|Altucher is an incredible salesman, I could see that from the get-go. I hate pushy salesman. I didn't hate Altucher's book. He is rather brutal in his assessment of our changing business climate. The middle class is dead, technology and temps have replaced you, and your boss hates you. He won my approval with that last one because from my experience, that is true. I was pretty sure he was looking in my former cubicle, asking whether one should \\"stay at a job where the boss is trying to keep you down, will eventually replace you, will pay you only enough for you to survive, will rotate between compliments and insults so you stay like a fish caught on the bait as he reels you in.\\" Bravo sir, you have described the futility of the bureaucracy brilliantly. That our economy is shifting and jobs have disappeared is obvious, and Altucher provides the statistics. Most of us are still slogging along in buggy whip factories, even as we know the automobile is about to take us out. We fret, we pray, we get angry, and we do the sit-and-spin. The author doesn't blame capitalism, but he does make available for our view the existing, albeit crumbling, usually invisible system. You have to see it to work with it, even as it is shifting. The author also is quick to tell about us about his failures. There have been a lot of them. I like this too. I never trust anyone who tells me about their steady and singular uphill climb to success because life is far more often about riding a razor sharp sawtooth edge. Altucher doesn't just kvetch, he gives you a swift kick (some effective motivation), and a ton of ideas to not only fuel your passion but also to improve your life - nutrition and sleep and meditation and integrity and connection and giving back ... and more. This isn't a fluffy book, but neither is it overly chewy philosophy (Foucault, anyone?). The writing is accessible, concise, clear and occasionally a little crude. You could absolutely read this book, toss it aside and forget all about it. But, I bet you won't, because what Altucher does best is give you a way, and invites you to give yourself permission to do something else, be something more, create something new and connect with other people in a meaningful way. Even if you don't think you want to change your job, shift your life, or face the habits you know are not good for you, pick this book up for the sheer joy of reading it. If you don't get an idea or two, recognize yourself a little bit, or find a few things to chuckle about, you might want to check your pulse.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|I really loved this game.  It kept my interest and is a very enjoyable point and click game.  It is not hidden object which is a plus for me.  Keep up the good work, Mediacity Games!
B001DHXT6G|2.0|The customer reviews for this version, the blue ray version and the single series version are all mixed up. Can't decide which one to purchase. Sorry, this isn't a customer review...I would be delighted to provide such, if I could figure out which version is best for me to enjoy.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The kids saw the movie and then wanted to download the game. They spend hours playing with it now and they are having fun.
B0082Z447U|5.0|This is a wonderful mystery novel! It was written in the 1800s and set the bar for most of the mystery novels written after it.
B00CWM3F4C|3.0|I bought this when it came out and have given it two months to sink in.  I like it.  It’s not what AiC was, but it never will be again.  The beauty of the former band was the harmony and contrast of having two great writer/singers in the same band.  Now that balance is gone.  It feels like the 4th (with BGWTB being the 3rd) solo album for Jerry. That’s not a bad thing, but it’s not what I was expecting.  In BGWTB i expected DuVall's contribution to be minor and it was.  I was hoping to see more of his writing and lead singing in this album to see if he is capable of being a creative foil to Cantrell, and it was disappointing not to see it.<br /><br />Overall I would rate this as my least favorite of their albums, but worthy of the AiC legacy.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Yeah everything was there, Shipping was fast and packaging was acceptable. I really only bought it for shadow of the colossus and i absolutely love that. Ico is okay, it's not really my thing to be honest so i can not really enjoy it to it's highest potential.
0062059963|5.0|This book was every bit as good as the first one, if not better, because now it's getting gritty. Claws are coming out, the rebels are attacking more often, and America still hasn't figured out what her heart is trying to tell her. This book wasn't as light and fluffy as the first book. I felt some intense, and not always good feelings towards the characters. America and Maxon included. In fact, I'm still mad at America for something she did. I actually yelled at her while reading. My husband thought I was crazy.  BUT! It's all a part of the whole experience.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|Interesting thought of inception in alagory applies to specifics of what we &#34;dream up&#34;. Fascinating, well acted and played out.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is so amazing. This is a must read for anyone! So amazingly  written, John green is an amazing writer.
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|2nd time watch for me - yet the characters still carry their mystique. Great shoot-em-up-and kill-'em-dead scenes, and super costumes and scripting. One would think you couldn't put a good ending on this one, but the writer and director did it - like Pandora's Box, hope remains. Story premise is good, actions scenes are good, actors are good, characters are good; result, no complaints. That's why I rate it almost perfect. It requires some getting into it thinking, so give yourself some silent space to watch and understand what's going on. Good flick!
B003M6FGTE|5.0|One of the things I like about this and other TV series from Amazon is not having any advertising.  And, you don't have to wait a week to see the next episode.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I was looking for a new series to watch and came across The Good Wife.  I love it!  Each episode is really compelling and I can't wait to see how the story unfolds.<br /><br />Great acting, diverse characters, interesting plot and the cases are thought provoking.  Kind of wish I was an attorney :-)
B00AYB12PC|5.0|Scream, wow, my significant other loves movies like this and I would recommend this movie if you like movies like this but Scream 2 will keep you on your feet, but watch this one first, and you will understand Scream 2.
B0089XH38M|5.0|I use it on all my android devices and on a kindle. It has stopped many threats and viruses. It is recommended by google to have an antivirus because anyone can put an app on google play or amazon.
B0096HFD8W|5.0|Scream 2, wow, my significant other loves movies like this, I must admit I did watch it and highly recommend Scream 2 if you like movies like this.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|GOOD ALBULM<br />GOOD SONGS<br />TO BAD HIS BEST SONG FRON THE NY CONCERT WAS LEFT OFF<br />NOT THE HIGHEST QUALITY RECORDING HE AND GOOD ENGINEERS COULD HAVE  PUT OUT.  I AM A STICKLER FOR THE SONICS<br /><br />MY WIFE LIKES IT MORE THAN I.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great scifi show enjoyed quiet a bit watched it in 2 days would recommend it to others can't wait till other seasons come
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This is a nice time killer, if you have plenty of that. The graphics are well, runs fine on my kindle fire hd. Have fun.
B00000JLWW|1.0|the price was 19.98,,said it was only one when I ordered ,this week it is 12.88 ,,go figure,sure will shop different next time!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I have used it to download apps successfully, but I am having problems trying to download a QVC app, but will keep trying
B0052RDHTM|4.0|You'll enjoy this book. It's a big, sprawling, Michener-like story about World War I and the period just preceding it.  It is told through characters that are British, American, German and Russian, with their stories intertwining. It works best when it is focusing on the characters.  I found that it dragged a little when the focus was on describing the history of the times, although I certainly learned a lot about that aspect. I'm looking forward to diving into the second book of the trilogy.
1439181780|4.0|Book in excellent new condition.  I am a newlywed and working to get everything in my life that I deserve.
0345531965|5.0|\\"The Testament\\" is a wonderful adventure story woven into a parable and decorated with humor and sarcasm. The main character, Nate, is vulnerable and imperfect, believable and moving, and we root for him against innumerable odds. The large cast of more superficial characters serves as such a contrast that we can't help questioning many of the money-driven values in our society.<br /><br />The adventure takes us from the fast-paced business and legal world of Washington to the dangerous but beautiful tropical wetlands of Brazil, where time means something completely different.<br /><br />\\"The Testament\\" is written with a masterful command of language subtleties and is a pleasure to read from start to finish.
B004S82OAE|5.0|I bought this book 2 months ago, it was kindle edition, honestly it's a great book, everything is explained pretty well, very good scenarios, hands on lab section, it seems that the author its explaining to you one on one everything, thank this book today I passed my CCNA exam, I want to thanks TODD for this great book and absolutely I recommend this book for everybody who wants to understand cisco technologies and pass the exam
B00340ESIS|4.0|This book educates and explains a part of the industry that can be difficult to grasp.  As a producer I loved it.  Helps me evaluate scripts better.
B00001OH7U|4.0|This also was part of my boyfriends birthday present. I've listened to it a few times, while in the car, so can't say I paid a lot of attention to it. However this is one of his favorites of Bowie, when he was young and always had this playing every morning he woke up!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I have this game on both my phone and my Kindle.  Very addicting, but also very fun.  If you like Bubble Mania, you'll love this one!
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|I have listened and enjoyed this CD dozens of times!  tracks 10 and 11 bring tears every time!  so beautiful!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I have been a fan of Star Trek for nearly 40 years and the two movies that JJ Abrams has produced have been the only Star Trek movies that have sparked and triggered that sense of joy and amazed wonder I had as a young boy watching the original series for the first time. Don't get me wrong, I love all the previous movies in the franchise too, its just that these movies really capture the magic of that first love.<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed the 2009 movie \\"Star Trek\\" so I had high expectations for this film. I think this movie surpassed my expectations. This movie has everything a Trekkie like myself could want. This movie is chocked full of action and adventure, and an intriguing story/plot with wonderful and moving character development all bound up in great eye caching special effects.<br /><br />I will not rehash the plot here but I do want to mention the addition of Khan as the villain. I was not sure if this would work. Ricardo Montalban was very iconic playing the role of Khan in the original series episode \\"Space Seed\\" and the feature film \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and I really wondered if Benedict Cumberbatch could pull it off. With this being an alternate time line I really think it worked. Yes, this Khan is a bit different because the story that is being told is also different and within that context it workd very well. The same elements are there. He is a superhuman who is intelligent and devious and dangerous!<br /><br />Star Trek Into Darkness is a movie that has it all. It also combines great drama with humor. If you enjoyed the 2009 Star Trek movie you will enjoy this one also!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 2 does not disappoint.  It is as good as season 1.  Some new characters are added to make for even more entangled scenerios.  Can't wait for season 3.
0316247545|5.0|This book is fabulous! I have a pony obsessed 4 year old, and when I found out that a friend from high school had written a book covering all things pony, I knew that she had to have it! It's better than I could have imagined...the first week she had it she literally carried it everywhere. She can open to any page, look at the picture, and tell me what the episode is about before I read it to her.  The pictures are beautiful and no detail is left behind! Highly recommend for any MLP fan!
B0081336FO|4.0|It's a great show and wish more tv was this good.  Love the actor Benedict Cumberbatch and his performance is great.
B00CHNKJFO|1.0|does not install /  work on S4, . . . can't let you know how it is...it is not compatible
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Very fun and simple. Great for keeping kid's busy any where. Perfect game to play while waiting for your turn at the doctor's office.
B008SOS63S|5.0|Joe Bonamassa continues to grow as a musician, his incorporation of the likes of Beth Hart, John Hiatt et al is awesome.
0316228583|5.0|First of all. I actually can really picture this book coming to life. I live in a small town with lots of the same type people involved in politics in it. JK Rowling nailed that on the head. Back biting and smiling to each other's face all in a day in the life..but anyways...<br /><br />Secondly-this book is NOT one of those you can't put down for dying to know \\"what is happening next\\" books. This book is a book however that will reached deep into my mind and make me realize just how human we all are. It takes on real life time and honestly I felt like I was there in Pagford.<br /><br />There are not characters in this book that you are going to cheer for..but isn't that part of the true human condition. Shades of gray instead of black and white. Right when you think of someone as a bad guy Ms. Rowling has them do something to make you think hmmm..that person could be me or someone I know. Secrets and scars abound in this story.<br /><br />JK Rowling. Write on my dear. I'll be here waiting to scarf up what you give us. You just shine my dear.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Great movie!! Deserved to win best picture at the Oscars!! I highly recommend. Bonus features are great too. worth buying
0525478817|3.0|What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said?? Not much. (3 stars because for some reason it just didn't connect completely with me)
B004GTLFNW|5.0|I stumbled upon this book while looking for something else, liked the title and then just bought it. I just finished reading it and I'll start with one of the programs suggested.<br />While I didn't know much about bodyweight training before (even though I was doing some of the exercises for many years), now I agree to it being a great method of training.<br />I appreciate that the author described the common myths, gave nutritional advice and put some personal stories and jokes here and there, rounding out the actual exercises descriptions.<br />I recommend this book to anyone for understanding the principles and applying them for a healthy life!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Moving without melodrama. I don't understand why I have to have seventeed more workds. I think that the first three should be enough.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|If you don't already know and live under a rock, this is the story of the US Navy SEALs' mission to kill Osama Bin Laden.  The author was a member of said team.  What was great about this book was the build up to the title mission.  Unofficially called Seal Team Six, these guys are literally the best of the best.  They are the best of the already crazy badass SEALS.  Owen describes his life coming from the teams to eventually becoming a part of devgru.  He sets the stage for the final mission with amazing detail.  The writing is very descriptive and emotional.  You almost feel like you are there with the author.  Read this book.
B000008ERZ|5.0|Great album I haven't heard in years.  Happy to share it with my teenager.  It is even better than I remember.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|I actually liked this book quite a bit.  While I liked it, overall it was rather Unscientific in its approach.  There are almost no citations, so you are to take the author at his word.  There are definitely some very interesting parts.  The section where Gladwell describes the ethnic problem of airplane crashes is truly fascinating.  The lack of political correctness is also a welcome relief.  Gladwell describes things as they are without sugar coating it to keep people from being offended.  His theories, however unscientific at times, seem plausible nonetheless.  Worth your time to read this.
1781162646|4.0|Years ago, when The Shining came out, I read it and was scared out of my wits.  I swore I would never read another Stephen King book.  When I read a review of Joyland, it sounded like something that I would read.  So I bought it and read it and enjoyed it.  It read like any other novel.  I like that it had young love, first love, relationships between individuals, the family unit of the carnival people.  There is enough mystery and intrigue to keep me in suspense (I wasn't scared out of my wits).  I really like reading about how the young man (primary character) matured.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Completed a review regarding Season 2 and this is just a repeat of how richly deserving this series is for the highest rating.  The writing and production level maintains the very best entertainment offering of anything on television...episode after episode.
B00486070K|5.0|I bought two of these; one for my desk and one for my bag. I've never had a connection issue with either one, and they're about as small as I've seen USB NICs.<br /><br />The only limitation with this USB adapter is that it's USB 2.0, and maxes out at 100 mbps. I wish it were USB 3.0 so it could make better use of my gigabit network's bandwidth. For 99% of my usage, though, I don't saturate the bandwidth, so it's not a big issue.<br /><br />There's a more expensive Thunderbolt adapter that supports gigabit networking, but I don't want to waste my MacBook Air's only TB port with that adapter.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Having seen all four seasons on Amazon, have to give a top grade to the creator/writers and of course, the cast.  With each episode it gets better and better.  I'm completely mesmerized by Alan Cumming's performance as an American political operative.  I still keep waiting for some of his enomoursely thick Scottish accent to escape, but not once has he faltered.  IN MY OPINION!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is amazing. I'm going to read anything I can find by Hugh Howey. An adult Hunger Games with awesome writing.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Once I started I couldn't stop.  I watched the entire 3 seasons in 10 days. Interesting time period and social structure.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Purchased this movie several weeks ago & just now got to watch it.  Great Movie & actors<br /><br />I would definitely recommend.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Nice sharpening tool, a bit lightweight but for the price it holds up very well.<br /><br />The five more words required.
B007SGM084|2.0|It is a commercial literature about money, consumerism and sex, like typical Hollywood movie. Something that will always make money. Will anyone pay attention to the book if the main character would not be a millionaire with the movie-star appearance? It has no relation to the real literature.
B009RH9J7W|2.0|Kindle keeps falling out of it.  I have to use the elastic around the top of it to make sure it doesn't fall out on me.
B00ET7EON4|4.0|Great album. The Arctic Monkeys have managed to slow the tempo down here but retain an even more powerful sound that makes for an impressive album.
B002NNA9N0|2.0|I'm not sure why so many critics loved this film. The dialogue, like most  modern plays, is so affected it's eye-crossingly overdone and boring. The acting is pretty good but the script...meh.<br /><br />Al Pacino spouts nihilistic nonsense to sell land to a schlub, Jack Lemon whines, begs, and annoys his boss Kevin Spacey, The other actors do nothing but have lame conversations and act as red herrings, save Alec Baldwin. His Oscar winning 3 minutes on-screen are spent giving a speech frat boys who love Ayn Rand love to laud, but if you analyze it, it says nothing.<br /><br />Salesmen competing with one another talk endlessly about nothing, curse, and overreact like children as they compete to win a Cadillac. Someone steals the \\"good\\" leads, but it's not who you think. The end. Seriously, that's the plot. Like any modern play, it's just internal conflict and no external, and it feels fake from the get-go and the dialogue comes off as the kind of smarmy crap a playwright would come up with.<br /><br />Did you study theater and love to make people think you're smart? You'll enjoy this.<br />Did you gush all your love juices for Ayn Rand's \\"The Fountainhead\\" and generally have your head in your rectum? You'll love this.<br />Do you like movies that tell a story, make you care about the characters and outcome? You'll hate this.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is one of the best apps I have. It is very clear and accurate I use it for all of my tablets.
B009MYARIK|3.0|The story line is just okay - funny but far fetched. Not Kinsella's best.  I read the story on the plane when I had nothing else to read.
