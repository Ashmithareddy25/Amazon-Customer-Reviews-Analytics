B004JMSIRC|5.0|Downey is great in the movie.  It very capably brought to life and modernized the Iron Man comics I read as a youth.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Say what you will about Sly...he knows how to make a great action film!  With every star you could ever want to see or have seen in an action film, this one is packed full of the fan favorites!<br />Loved it!
B00B99KJR0|4.0|The game deviates from the actual story, but it's an addicting Match 3 with nice graphics. I would give the game 5 stars, but for a few minor details. The pieces are a little small, which is a strain on my poor eyesight and I wish the game were more point based as opposed to timed. Although, I haven't taken the time to see if there are options to change that. Either way, it is a fun game.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|it is fun and mysiours. FAvorite line :it walks like a duck quacks like a duck it's a frechin duck!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I really like this book but I wish it would have ended differently.  I wont way how I wish it ended bucause I dont want to give anything away :)
B000063V8T|5.0|My first order of this product had one disc that was playing with skips through all four episodes.  I followed the return procedures, returned it and received a replacement back with no fuss.  The replacement is perfect!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Have watched the whole series and it's a fun adventure. The dialog is quick and witty ,English style, and brings a great contemporary twist to Sherlock to a new generation

B005R32L66|5.0|THIS APP HAS IMPROVED OVER THE YEARS...VIDEO IS BETTER THAN YAHOO ETC.<br /> AUDIO IS CLEAR BOTH ON TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE. I USE IT ON AN ICS CLONE MADE BY COBY (KYROS 10.2) 1042.<br />  THIS HAS BEAT ALL THE OTHER VIDEO CHATS I HAVE USED
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was amazing.  I didnt think I would like it, but I could not put it down.  Finished it in 2 days.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|O.k.  i saw that some people gave this a 1.  I read the reviews.  Most of the 1's were from people who only listened to the samples and did not buy.  This is an album that needsto be heard front to back.  Phenomenal on soe studio monitors.  Do not bother on acheap stereo, it does not capture all that it is. Love it!
B008OOYALE|1.0|this is the worst game ever! I would do anything to get rid of this game.I am 17 years older than my 12 year old sister.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It's slow in the first couple of lvls but its great once you get passed all that. Plus there is so much you can do with the game in the area of arrangements.
037575251X|4.0|The Call of the Wild is by far one of the best books I've ever read.<br />Because it's about a dog that gets kidnapped and forced to become something he doesn't want to and there is lots of excitement and it never gets boring.<br /><br />The genre is adventure because he never got to stop and rest, he would get to eat little, rest for about 4 hours or less.<br /><br /> The main characters are: Buck (dog that got kidnapped), Spitz (he fought with Buck.  Buck is a husky and he is very big and strong and he is quite intelligent.  His experience helped him with the fight against Spitz.<br /><br /> The Call of the Wild takes place in a hot climate and then in a cold climate and he stayed in the cold climate for a long time.<br /><br /> Buck started out as a judge's dog but he got kidnapped one day and was shipped by a train and he was certainly not happy about that! So when he got to the place that they took him to there was a guy who was the person he was supposed to meet (he had a red turtle neck sweater and a club in his right hand.) As soon as he unlocked the cage he jumped right at the guy and he hit him in the face with his club.  (This shows how cruel people were back then to animals.) So Buck kept pouncing and also kept getting struck until he passed out.<br /><br /> After he was shipped to a icy climate and he was very confused he had never seen this ever before (Snow) then after a while at camp there were other dogs chanting \\"Fight, Fight, Fight,\\" so he took a look and a girl was fighting a boy and she lost and the dogs started to rip her body apart he was devastated!  He didn't know it but he was a snow dog.<br /><br /> The Call of the Wild is one of the only books that I loved and I love this book because it never gets boring at any point in the book, some people might think it's boring but I don't listen to people that think it's boring.  It might be too hard for some people and if they aren't that good at reading or don't know some hard words, I wouldn't make them read it. Otherwise, I recommend it for every 4th grader in the country to read The Call of The Wild.ke them read it. Otherwise, I recommend it for every 4th grader in the country to read The Call of The Wild.
0670026603|5.0|I loved this book, I laughed and cried through the whole book. I showed Louisa and Will's deep caring for each other. I will definitly read more by this author. 5*****.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|A little dated compared to today's cgi capabilities, etc. but still good especially for the younger kids to see and appreciate.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves this she plays it all the time! If you don't have this app get it NOW!!! Perfect for horse lovers and for animal lovers. Plus it's FREE!
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|My son and I enjoy this game a lot. It is fun to try the different layouts, and try out all of the different Monkeys, and see what happens!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Great cast and well written story.  Drama, comedy, beautiful location and sets.  Cannot wait for the next season, and the next, and the next.....
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|I love Sanderson's stuff. His short stories ruin me though. The are really clever and leave you longing for a long form story in that world. It is the same story with The Emperor's Soul. So much story to be told but you only get a glimpse. That being said, I really enjoyed it and would recommend it.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I am up to level 55 and still loving it.  Great time for all age groups.  The story line is fun but wish it would talk to me.  I am playing with the sound off.
B002RZZIXU|5.0|I am a huge fan of William Boyd and once again was not disappointed. One never wants to put the book down and can't wait to get back to it, wonderful characters and and as always an unexpected ending. Most enjoyable.
0321885112|5.0|If you want to feel like you'll get the hang of sketchnoting or visual recording, this is it. Fantastic book. It's inspiring and makes you want to get in and start drawing. Shows you the difference between well constructed sketches and professional illustrations and why construction of the sketch however basic is more important than the ability to draw fancy illustrations when taking visual notes. Hope for beginners and inspiration for everyone!
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Yes, this is one of the good ones. The movie is nostalgic, touching, and very funny.  Graphics are fantastic, but it's the story and characters that take it from cute to wonderful.  I want to play Sugar Rush!  Indeed, even the Sugar Rush song is a little mesmerizing.<br /><br /> I don't buy very many movies.  So my highest rating for a movie is &#34;Buy it now&#34;.  And that's where Wreck-it Ralph falls.
B00946WM6Q|5.0|Daniel Craig makes an excellent Bond! I thought he had the role well in hand. The movie was great as well! Loved the scene at the old warehouse where James is taking a beating and still manages to crack a joke! Also, there were wonderful views of Venice. Lots of action, James seducing women, and the climax of the movie had me guessing! Glad I purchased it. If you like Bond movies, you have to see this one!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book even if the target demographic audience is teenagers. The story is well developed and the characters are presented in a way that anyone can relate to them - young or older - and you want to see where the story will take them. Reading the book is helpful in understanding the movie - the movie can stand on it's own but without reading the book you lose a lot of the background from the book that make the story so much more interesting.
1451695195|4.0|With the recent loss of my father and a man of faith, this book helped me deal with some of the questions that were rattling around in my head.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very good game. you see for your self.fun fun fun game best i have on my kindle fire everyone i know has it also again very fun
145210655X|5.0|My son is a huge Star Wars fan.  I bought this for him and he loved it!  It's a great father/son story too!
B009UZBLSG|5.0|The only surprise I experienced using this device to connect a Nexus 4 to an hdmi display was that the Nexus 4 home screen is forced into landscape mode independent of how you hold it. Of course that is the Nexus's issue, not the adapter's.<br /><br />It is nice that you aren't required to use an external power adapter like the MHL adapter for my Galaxy S3.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Better than I expected it to be.  The story was a little slow at first then WHAM I couldn't put it do!
B00BG08FKK|3.0|This is a comparative review of the Deluxe Recording of the Movie Soundtrack of Les Miserables [[ASIN:B00BG08FKK Les Misérables: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]] with the four best of the recordings of the musical, the Original London Cast (OLC), [[ASIN:B004Y166GI Les Misérables - Original London Cast Recording]]; the Original Broadway Cast (OBC), [[ASIN:B000000OQI Les Miserables (1987 Original Broadway Cast)]]; the Complete Symphonic Recording (CSR), [[ASIN:B0002E5L62 Les Miserables Complete Symphonic Recording]]; and the 10th Anniversary Edition (10th Anniv.), [[ASIN:B0002E5O9G Les Miserables 10th Anniversary Concert]].  After listening several times to each recording, I would rank the Deluxe Version of the Soundtrack below all of the recordings of the musical.  The Soundtrack version has the advantage of more songs than the two original cast recordings, but has three substantial flaws that cause me to lower it's rank.  First many of the songs are substantially cut, and unfortunately in many cases the cuts occur in the middle of the songs. None of the other versions has a mid-song cut.  It is an execrable decision that ruins several of the songs. Second, the thing that shocked me next most in listening to this recording is the lack of intensity that the singers brought to most of the songs.  There are some exceptions (such as Anne Hathaway's rendition of \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\", and Hugh Jackman's \\"Bring Him Home\\").  Russell Crowe is particularly guilty of this flaw, but none of the singers escapes this altogether.  It's particularly surprising given the intensity these actors brought to the acting of the roles.  Finally, there is a delicate balance in all musical dramas, whether they are films, operas or Broadway musicals.  This is the balance between being a singing actor (in which the acting has primacy) or an acting singer (in which the singing has primacy).  All of the musical recordings have balanced the two extremes well, but the Soundtrack is far towardthe acting end, and in most cases fails to do justice to the score.<br /><br />What is my overall ranking of the other versions?  For me the lowest ranking is the OLC, simply because the Javert fails to keep in tune in his two critical songs, \\"Stars\\", and \\"Javert's Suicide\\".  Next is the Broadway Cast.  The Javert is better, and the rest of the cast is strong, but there are too many songs left out, and there are places that the cast could be better.  The best sung is the 10th Anniversary recording, which retains much of the cast of the two original recordings, but has the incomparable Philip Quast as Javert.  It also has Lea Salonga as Eponine, the finest of the Eponine's on record.  However it will be marred for some because, as a live performance, it does include applause from an enthusiastic audience.  It also has the minor drawback that, because it is limited to two (very full) disks, some material that is valuable had to be left out.  The other top recording is the CSR.  It is the most complete, with two full disks, and a third disk with an extra 20 minutes of material.  It is not quite as well sung in parts as the 10th Anniv, but all of the performances are still strong, and the completeness is admirable.<br /><br />In summary, if you want a complete recording, buy the CSR.<br />If you want the best sung, and you can deal with the applause, the 10th Anniv.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I love this game it keep you on your toes I like matching up gems to see them all fall this game is for all ages
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I saw Les Mis live in 1990 and loved it.  I was so excited when I saw the preview of the movie.  As soon as this was out, I bought it.  I love the live quality of the music and how it allows for more emotion in the singing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am slightly similar to many of the characters. The humor is what truly pulled me in, as that is my humor. I fell in love with Gus' characteristics, and sobbed for about an hour when he died. This book is one of the best I have read in quite some time. I truly thought I had more to say, until I actually started writing this. All around a great book.
B0085W09ME|1.0|This appt is great until you go to book it. Shows all supposedly available flights but when you press to book, it says not available and to choose another flight. After four<br />alternates, I gave up!!
B000I3UAJ0|4.0|I'm not sure why I never saw this first movie in the series before. It starts off slow & obviously the director & editors were quite enamored with the computer effects, because they spent way to long showing effects that by today's standards are poor. But patience pays off, as I found the story-line, the sci-fi concept that unfolds very intriguing.
1616550414|5.0|This book is a must for every fan of the game, the quality of the pages, drawings, everything is magnificent.<br /><br />I recommend this completely.
B00A6N7BS0|3.0|Good cast.  Decent story.  Didn't really like the whole sharing of the girl them in the movie.  I guess they were going for some sort of shock value but it got creepy and annoying after a while.  Del Toro's role was very good and Selma Hayek was pretty ruthless.  Travolta's role was sort of silly.  Overall, an ok movie for some mindless entertainment.
157421327X|5.0|Love this entangle method really takes me away from stresses.<br />And grands love it to. Once you start it's hard to stop !!!
B0086HGW42|5.0|This is a great CD. This is one of those CD's where if you like it you like it right away; every track on this CD is good in my opinion. Reminds me of Jason Mraz at times
B0028T6XXY|4.0|What can you say its Michael Buble and awesome singer that you can tell enjoys his work.  Great buy for anyone who enjoys good contemporary music.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|The overall story line remains plausible and interesting.  Would have rated it five stars, but there are a few too many character eccentricities.  Am beginning to tire of the longing gazes between WIll and Alicia.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|Interesting story in that real historical events made fictional actually seemed a little believeable.  Entertaining movie, well acted, very good special effects.  Overall, I was entertained.
B00942Y6WI|5.0|We really enjoyed the story and the connection to the characters.  The challenges of racial inequality is both ugly and completely condemned by the Creator.  As hard as it is at times to visualize through this film the realities of why African Americans were treated this way, facing the truth and repenting is always the best way move on.  Hopefully every generation of children are required by their parents to watch films like this that help them balance the challenges they will face in their lives.
B000E5KJD4|5.0|love the movie after getting the blue ray one, but i gave it to a friend (this one) and the quality is amazing in my own personal opinion
B001NLKT60|4.0|My experience of middle trilogy books is that they simply try to get you from 'here' to 'there.'  The Girl Who Played with Fire goes much further than that with additional character and information development.  I started with the movies and am really happy that I decided to read the books.  Much of what you will find in book two was missing from the movie.
B0079J28NW|5.0|I must have watched Yellow Sub 35-40 times from VHS on, but this Blue Ray can't be beat: Brighter colors, much sharper details, perfect updated sound. Give your old Yellow Subs to your friends, this one's a keeper.
B00B671W6W|2.0|I've been a fan of Anthrax since 'Spreading the Disease' and they have picked some good cover songs over the years ('Antisocial', 'Sects', 'Friggin in the Riggin', 'Got The Time'), but I can't say they same about this collection.<br /><br />These are classic rock songs which I don't really care for to start with (except TNT), and while Joey and the band sound good, the songs still sound \\"classic\\". There is nothing done to them to change the sound to make me like them.<br /><br />Maybe if you like the originals AND you like Anthrax, this would be a good purchase. But this just isn't my thing.<br /><br />With 'Worship Music' being a 5-star release, at least these songs keep the band rolling towards making more new music, hopefully.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|Of course I ordered Breaking Dawn Part 1 when it was first released, but this extra footage was so worth spending the money to buy it again. I only sawit on Amazon. It wasn't available at Target OR Walmart,so I'm glad I looked online. A great addition to my Twilight collection. Loved it &#60;3
B007XAYKX8|5.0|Great on-bike video capture!  Will have you on the edge of your chair every second in the races!  These guys defy gravity and the Grim Reaper at the same time.  You won't believe human beings can function and react at the incredible speeds these guys hit, and a spill at 165 mph on a curve will blow your mind.  These bikes go faster than NASCAR racers.  It is ballet on two wheels.  Covering one single racing season with all the top contenders, the rivalries and interviews alone are fascinating to watch.  Pure adrenaline, all the way.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|So many good things have been said in many other reviews, I cannot under any pretense add anything significant.<br />I just wanted to contribute another five stars to keep the average very high.<br />I recently saw the movie on cable... once... and decided to buy it so I can see it again and start picking up all the little nuances I'm sure I missed!  Also, with the blu-ray Ill be able to enjoy it in full 1080 rather than our cable provider's 720! (I know it's no big deal... I just like the picture to be perfect.)<br />I seriously recommend this movie if you like good writing, excellent actors, and a story with a unique feel good effect.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|If you read this book with an open mind it will change your life.  Who among us doesn't hope there is an afterlife?Having a neurosurgeon tell the story gives it absolute credibility.  I have always been a believer ..and bought additional copies to send to my children .  Have not yet gotten feedback from them.  Be good to yourself and read this book.
B007REV4YI|4.0|Skyfall is a good movie. It's got some good action and an interesting story line. It really mixes in the old with the new, especially during the 2nd half of the movie, for those that have seen other Bond movies in the past. If you like Bond, you should definitely watch it at least once.
B00AATV046|5.0|We have a list of movies we have to see every Christmas season and this movie takes top billing for me.
0671646788|3.0|This was an ok book. It didn't hold my interest and so I had a hard time reading this. I ended up giving it the Goodwill.
B0060MYM3S|2.0|I loved Season One of Game of Thrones. I love the action/drama/mystery dimensions to it. I loved the fact that it was set in the 1100s or so.<br /><br />I had a hard time with Season Two.<br /><br />I had a hard time getting through Episode Two's various portrayals of incest. In fact, it made me angry how casually it made this portrayal. I decided to trudge on.<br /><br />Big mistake! I was then bothered with the Sci Fi / Fantasy dimensions of the Qaarth people. Why bother with the \\"magic\\" and \\"wizardry\\" since it was all fake? To me, it really detracted from the realism of the main story.<br /><br />I also thought the personification of the \\"Black Death\\" was pretty weak. Why throw in the kitchen sink when you already have such strong acting and such a compelling political and military struggle over on the \\"island\\" (whatever you call it).<br /><br />I also thought that the Jon Snow story line was pretty weak and almost unworthy of being covered at all. I don't get why the Hill Peoples are at war with the \\"southerners\\" if they are also fighting the \\"White Walkers.\\"<br /><br />Anyway, I didn't even it make it that far. The Qaarth people were just too weird and it was making my head hurt. That's likely a big NO to Season 3, at least as far as ownership.<br /><br />I thought, maybe I should just read the novels. But then I thought, maybe I would be better off reading a good history of the War of the Roses. That is what I think I am going to do.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|When I first heard Zac Brown and his band, I fell in &#34;love&#34; with them.  His voice is what makes the songs great.
B007SGM084|1.0|I found the writing to be elementary and very predictable.  I was EXTREMELY disappointed, especially after all the news hype it received. Next time I will ask around before I buy . . .
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Really liked this game makes you use all your senses.  It gets to be addictive.  I enjoyed it very much.
B005G4TJUC|3.0|This was a present for the grandson, so I can't really rate it as I have never seen it. I am sure he really enjoyed it.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|even though you may have trouble finding some of the hidden objects there are plenty of hints. I enjoyed the game and the story line is good.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|Of course this is a great series. The Blu Ray offers excellent video and audio quality so the package is recommended.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books are so good , I ate them up in 1 week. I couldn't wait to get to the next page. This is my 2nd time around and now I am enjoying them just as much as the 1st. A must read for anyone( 18 and older)
B008CIUS72|1.0|From what I read,  I thought this was supposed to help me view videos that required a flash-player.  Didn't, so I took it off.  Still can't see some videos on my Kindle Fire HD.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm hooked like everyone else.<br />I'd been hearing everyone talk about Downton this, Downton that.  When I got my Kindle Fire for Christmas and then purchased Amazon Prime I had no excuse not to start watching it.  I was snagged from the first episode.  &#34;<br /><br />I wil be a regular watcher from now on !!
0756697875|5.0|I bought this for my Batman Lego fan son and he reads it almost every night.  It's a big book and the nice thing about it is that it's quite complete with a listing of Batman and other related figurines from when then started to 2012.  Price is good as I got it for the list price in a store for xmas, but it was worth it then.  It also comes with one of the Batman figurines, there's a few (the book will help sort them out) and I think maybe it's the electric suit Batman.  The figurine is lost (probably was shoved into my ventilation system, that'll what kids will do), but the book is still a favorite.  And if you want to know what to get them for the next birthday or holiday's, bring out the book and ask them.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|This is just a placeholder for the review to be done at a keyboard.<br />Short version:<br />Fun game w amazing production value, but over the top advertising in initial screens.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Although I didn't completely agree with everything, this was a great read.  I always like getting another perspective on things with parenting, because even if you take away one tip to help you as a parent it is worth it.  I recommend either to parents with of babies (as if you even have time to read) or moms-to-be.
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|At first, I thought maybe it was a good game to have available for my grandkids.  I played it a few times and got sucked right in.  Fun.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|This sucks. Doesn't work. Why is this allowed? For some reason by kindle won't download the regular vBulletin app. Her frustrated.
1616550414|5.0|There will be no other like this book - it is the definitive source of information and artwork for the franchise, and the only known official source of the Zelda timeline.  And for twenty bucks, there's no reason not to buy it.
0307265730|5.0|I love Jhumpa Lahiri's story telling.  The only thing I didn't like is that one part is about an affair.  As a happily married woman, I kind of get annoyed by stories about affairs, but otherwise, I just adore her writing.  If you like this one, you'll absolutely adore The Namesake and The Interpreter of Maladies.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I thought this was a good read, although I haven't seen the movie yet.  It was interesting seeing how a man and woman go from seemingly so self sufficient to so dependent on others.
0735619670|5.0|This is my go-to book for overall coding standards and suggestions.  It is well-written and clear.  The principles and guidelines it covers are things that every programmer should consider.  I make all of my new programmers at least read selections from it (in fact that is part of our training program.)  I highly recommend this to any programmer who cares about producing quality code.
0307474259|5.0|Excellent book, gives you all the information you need to change the way you eat and to get healthy. I have lost 75 pounds since July 2012 by following the advice in this book. Everyone around me is thrilled with my results so buying 2 more books to give to goods friends. Well worth the investment and the read
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is an amazing story.  Never expected the ending.  I can' t wait for the 4th series. The castle is beautiful.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This show is wonderful.  I can't wait to watch each and every episode.  I wish I had it on Bluray but the DVD's will do for now.
B0026S93C0|3.0|I remember seeing this in the 80s and thought it was so great, watched it for the fun of it, and just couldn't figure out why I was so taken by this mover 30 years ago. It still is a nice movie but even for me, I don't know what all the hype was about.
B004Y1USJE|5.0|Other reviewers have said it better so I'll keep it simple. This album is amazing and it's sad that Benoit David is no longer involved with Yes. He's got a beautiful voice.<br />I look forward to the next album!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|still in the third book,<br />the trilogy is meeting my expecttions<br />The Hunger Games Trilogy Wonderfully stimulating<br />Thanks you much
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great, great show. Watch if you enjoy badassery of the first order. Several incredible actors come together for one kick-ass ride! You will recognize certain actors from all of the best shows: Deadwood, Lost...even Waterworld! Seriously, though...Waterworld.<br />Stick with Sons of Anarchy, and you won't go wrong. Believe.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This show is wonderful.  I can't wait to watch each and every episode.  I wish I had it on Bluray but the DVD's will do for now.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This always surprises me when a show is so different than I expected. I really enjoy these shows. The ending is always a surprise.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|A heart-warming & beautifuly made film about an incredibly original, and long under-appreciated artist. Well deserving of its Academy Award.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|great movie. lots of action. a little different than earlier Bond movies, but still worth watching.<br />I am hearing impaired, so THANKS AMAZON for having subtitles!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I truly enjoyed this series in the omnibus edition! The story is engaging and moves quickly. I would recommend this book to family and friends. I have found a new author to follow as well!
B007REV4YI|4.0|Plenty of action and great sound effects..Picture was excellent quality along with a good surround sound track. If you like the abound movies I would recommend.
B0081336FO|5.0|This always surprises me when a show is so different than I expected. I really enjoy these shows. The ending is always a surprise.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I got to the tiger shark and then lost my data. I can't keep coins or sharks after that. The game is great, though! The graphics are great, and it gives hours of fun.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I think it is a fascinating tale and would be subject of a good movie.  This book is a real pageturner
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Perfect timing for me to read this book around my 50th birthday as I begin to reflect on time passing so quickly. It's a wonderful, spiritual journey that is quick and easy to read.
B001TM14VC|5.0|Still loves this 80's movie. Quality is good, but some remastering and noise cancellation that some other older movies has got wouln'd hurt to make it great.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|With the bands on hand held  cell phones in many areas while driving I thought I try this device.  It is great.  Easy to setup, great battery life and they voice quality is really good for hands free use.  I've bought four of the for the family.  My only suggestion would be to include a 110 volt charger in place of the 12 volt or as an option.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Love the characters.Can't wait to read more about Ethan an<br />l. Glad Macon is back great twist in the story.

B0038JN6VA|3.0|I really like the sound of this small speaker. The &#34;off and on button&#34; stopped functioning after a few months though. The only way it would work was when I plugged it into my computer via usb.
B006TJXZ30|1.0|It does not work well on my tablet. Forget about the Kindle Fire. Needs work before I load it again.

B005LAIHXQ|4.0|Or not? While chock full of questions, Prometheus still grabs my attention with sets and costumes that remind me of how Alien gripped me with the fear of the unknown and other things out there to remind us of how human we are.
B0097HSS4M|1.0|This photo editor does allow you to crop photos,  and generally soften or minimize basics like redeye whitening and tints.  It really doesn't d a good job with general enhancement.  It does make it easy take a photo a kindle, crop it, and make a few minor enhancements before easily sending it off via email, Facebook, etc.  I'm looking for something more versatile.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Very entertaining movie. The photography is unmatched. I would watch it again, and soon. The story itself is tremendous. Thanks
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Don't start this unless you have the time because you won't be able to stop! If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would!
B002YEQRPC|5.0|Muy buen servicio, llegó en perfectas condiciones! Llegó antes de la fecha indicada al momento de realizar la compra por la web.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Over all this book was well written.  The ending was a little disappointing but it did keep me wondering.  It had an unusual plot line and told in a distinct way (mainly alternating between the voice of the two main characters).  I would recommend reading it.
B000TEMQNG|5.0|I am a Bowie fan and thoroughly enjoy his re-mastered albums.  They bring back memories from my childhood ... when I started becoming musically literate.  Great quality MP3s for download.
B00BVDNKSY|5.0|When the easiest level is hard, and then come harder and hardest, you know you're gonna suffer. Your first few games, you'll last just a few seconds. Don't worry, all it takes to 'win' a stage is to survive 60 seconds. It took my 40 years old brain a couple of days to beat the easiest level, and quite a few more to beat the 2nd. I swear I could feel the new neural connections being formed and how so many long sleeping neurons had to get in shape.<br /><br />Anyways, an amazing game that forces you to be in the zone, reminds me just a bit of tempest 2000 and space giraffe by the great Jeff Minter.<br /><br />With this game, Terry created a masterpiece and imho is now part of the coders hall of fame. You should also check his vvvvv (on steam, for windows/mac and linux), another great game.

B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I enjoy listening to it.  Josh Groban was always a favorite of mine.  I did not like his last cd but he has redeemed himself with &#34;All That Echoes&#34;.  Beautiful songs, music and singing.

B00B2DSK06|5.0|It teaches a couple great lessons for kids. For example, to never give up on your dreams, or to fight for what you want the most. My daughter learned that it is very important to listen to your friends and family to help them with problems. 😄 love it!!

B000QRIGLC|2.0|Excellent talent as a fighting machine, but writing is not in the works.  Very little on the technical aspects of becoming a highly specialized fighter.  A very simplistic view of the rationale for his mission, i.e., all enemies are &#34;evil&#34;.  Well, what if they are just doing the job they are tasked to do as well.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Lots of info for anyone desiring to publish an ebook. Inspiration. John really got us a winner here. Recommended to all authors.

B0037VNX44|4.0|Good acting.  Good action flick with solid acting for a guys kind of movie.  Would recommend to anyone who likes Gangster/Criminal/Lock up kind of movie.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|I was under the impression that this movie got great reviews, but it was really boring and dragged out for way too long.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I got this book as a flight companion, and I actually wanted the six-hour trip to last longer because I really got into this book. The plot's already been covered elsewhere, but this is a fun read, very exciting, and even if you're not especially into thrillers, this book really pulls you in. I feel empathy and connection to the protagonist even though I have no tattoos myself :-P Recommended.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I have to say this 1st book of her new series is really fantastic.  I am very excited to read more about this new character and  his hidden birth rite....
B0001KZM4I|5.0|I've always hesitated to buy this because I liked &#34;Fisherman's Blues&#34; so much and thought, in comparison I would find this earlier incarnation a disappointment. So I'm wrong. Big deal, I'm happily wrong. The songwriting is at times sublime and powerful, the music excellent, and Mike Scott is just a singer I like a lot. Great music, and a song that will always be a favorite for me is &#34;The Whole of the Moon.&#34; What a beautiful expression of the love you feel for someone so far ahead of you that you can never seem to catch up with her until she's gone. So you write the poem and you pour your heart into those words and that melody.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This movie was lots of fun. Of course I love music, so this already had a good chance with me, but it had a good little story line to go along with it. My daughter and I just about have it memorized from watching it so much!

0312611692|5.0|The book opens with the description of the counter-factual event of Queen Victoria paying homage to the Chinese governor Qiying who has arrived to take up his post as the governor of the British colony in the Chinese empire. The author uses this device to dramatize the question posed in the title, why was it that the exact opposite of this scene actually occurred in history; why was it that it was English gunboats that sailed up the Yangtse rather than Chinese gunboats that sailed up the Thames. To answer this question the author starts with a review of the current state of historical analysis, summarizing it as two schools of thought: the long-term lock-in and the short-term accident theories. He faults these theories for being too one-dimensional, for viewing societies from too narrow a perspective, and for not looking far enough back \\"across the sweep of history\\". To provide a truer explanation he sets himself the task of measuring what he calls the \\"social development\\" of the East versus the West from pre-historic times (actually pre-human times) using the methods of archeology, paleoanthropology, sociology in addition to traditional historical analysis. He measures the level of social development by looking at four aspects of society: energy capture, organization/urbanization, war-making, and information technology. Taking these measurements at different points along the time axis he then plots the curve of social development versus time for East and West to produce a picture of a race where sometimes one side has been ahead and sometimes the other. For me, an engineer, this innovative quantitative approach reeks of good sense; if you are going to compare two things you need to define what you are measuring, quantify your measurements, gather the data, and display your results. I, of course, have no way of evaluating how accurate and reliable the information is, especially the archeological conclusions stretching back fifteen millennia or more into the past, but on the assumption that in his area of expertise Prof Morris knows what he is talking about I am confident that in reading this book I have gotten a good solid answer to the question posed in the title.<br /> t on the assumption that in his area of expertise Prof Morris knows what he is talking about I am confident that in reading this book I have gotten a good solid answer to the question posed in the title.<br />

B009EAO38C|5.0|Last weekend while watching the PBS exclusive video of The Piano Guys, I was inspired to purchase the MP3 album they produced.  I have listened to it again and again, visualizing the energy, enthusiasm, and love for music this group possesses.  The variety of songs only adds to my listening pleasure.  I can't wait until the DVD is released after PBS completes it fund raising season.  It will be on my list to purchase so I can not only hear the music again, but also watch the group performing it.

B001BR5NN0|4.0|Loved this film as a teenager; still do but cringed several times when watching it with my &#34;tween&#34; kids due to language and drug use (smoking pot in the library) - provoked lots of good discussion about not only that but also (not) judging people by what they wear or who their friends are.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Love the music, very good casting and good for toddlers and adults!  Love the characters and graphics.  Hope they make a two!
B000002JOF|4.0|To be honest this album passed me by when released in 1989, except The Road To Hell (Part 2), which is a driving (!) number if I ever heard one.<br />Having heard the album I can certainly recommend it for AOR listerners, in places Chris sounds like Dire Straits and he clearly wants to capture the US market.<br />With guitar, drums and consise vocals to the fore I enjoy The Road To Hell (Part 1 and 2), You Must Be Evil, Texas and Tell Me There's A Heaven, even if the latter heads toward middle of the road with orchestral input.<br />At 50 minutes long and with lyrics printed on the insert, this is well worth owning.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great music, hilarious comedy, and a very good story.  I would hope any college aged kid could have the experience of conviction, creativity, and redemption that the main character experiences.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great acting & edge-of-your-seat suspense!  Using clips from news broadcasts of the period was also very effective!  Ben Affleck did a great job with this movie.  Amazing how much the actors looked like the people they were portraying!

0385349947|1.0|This privileged author has nothing of value to say to women like me, who work out of necessity.  We hate our jobs and have no choice about becoming leaders.  We wouldn't if we could. Lean in?  What a laugh.  We are exhausted at the end of the day, count every penny, and never had a choice about going to college.  We didn't pick our jobs- they are not careers, they are JOBS.  The better role model for us would be a Mother Jones or an Emma Goldman.  Enjoy your money, Miss so and so.  You will never know what real life is like for the majority of women.  Feminists of my generation questioned whether it was true to feminism to try to fit into patriarchal organizations like corporations.  Some thought it was selling out and that patriarchal institutions were incapable of reform and should be shunned.  So women like the author are selling out to the \\"man.\\"
B00BHMF578|5.0|Suspenseful, action packed movie.  Not entirely factual; however, it is based upon the rescue of hostages that proves to be a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  One of the better movies viewed in quite some time.

B003UBTX6S|5.0|It was much better than most second books are but then again, who can expect less the the best from Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl? I loved the high tension and action that was incorporated into this book.<br /><br />*spoilers*<br />It sincerely tested Ethan's strength, throughout the entire book I as the reader felt that the relation between Ethan and Lena was a really strong one, and more than that made you love this sweet couple even more. Unlike the first book, in this book we get a little more Ethan  Lena<br />than the usual EthanLena. Here's how I would summarize it:<br /><br />After Ethan's near death experience and Lena's sacrifice to the book of the moons, Lena is now completely lost and seemingly going dark. On the day of her Uncle's funeral, a young incubus steps in the sunlight, Ethan finds this weird but does'nt put much thought into it until he discovers he's John Breed, a hybrid incubus who's seemingly more powerful than a regular incubus. Quite soon, Lena starts spending more time with John and Ridley, over Ethan. Henceforth, making Ethan jealous. At the same time, a exchange student from England called Liv comes to help Marian, who as it turns out is training Liv to replace her some day. When they go to the carnival however, Lena see's Ethan talking to Liv and thinks that he;s moved on and left Lena.  After quite some thought, summer in Gatlin turns tails when Lena decides to run away with John and Ridley to some sort of Caster garden of Eden.  And Ethan, upon realizing that there was something wrong with the order of things, goes out to find Lena in a dangerous quest for love and survival.
B00BRR66SA|4.0|I am really enjoying this album.  Like his last album, this one includes many interludes and lengthy introductions to songs.  It really is an \\"experience\\" that you have to listen to straight through, but definitely a good one.  I wish the interludes were separate tracks so I could listen to a single song without committing to a 7-8 minute listening session, but it's a great listen straight through anyway.  Looking forward to volume 2...
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Obviously historically inaccurate but entertaining all the same.  Good music and believable acting brought it together for me.  The special effects worked well.

B00B99KJR0|5.0|this is a game that gets harder the more you get into it, really challenges you with trying to beat the clock to complete a level, I wish it had a pause feature, so you could get a drink or answer the phone, but it is a worthy game, at least to me.

B004W1GCNC|5.0|The style of this remake is nuanced, charming, and a great setup for a full blown plot.  Character development is set, and the areas of conflict among the socio-economic classes are clearly introduced.  For a short 3-episode season, this 3 hour set is very approachable and enjoyable.  Recommend subtitles for the highest enjoyment.

B000002MTU|5.0|This is a fantastic album.  Clapton takes a bunch of great old blues standards and absolutely tears them up.  From what I understand, this is what they call a  \\"live studio album,\\" or something along those lines.  In other words, they did not take the vocal track from one take, superimpose it on the guitar track from another take, etc.  The tracks that you hear on the album are all from the same take.    This album showcases Clapton's abilities and utterly bleeds emotion.  This album is an ideal forum for Clapton's claim to fame as one of the great guitar players ever.  You can tell he is completely and utterly at home in the context of this album, and the chops he sets forth absolutely show that.  Unconvinced of his emotional committment to this album?  Listen to the vocals in Five Long Years.    And this album is precisely why I hate Eric Clapton.  I cannot understand why a guy with this kind of ability and this sort of emotion for playing the blues spent the better part of his career turning out mediocre pop crap.  The Yardbirds were significant, and Creem was a legendary, innovative band that broke all kinds of new ground.  Layla rightfully takes its place as one of the great rock 'n roll albums of all time (thanks in no small part to Brother Duane).    But from there he goes to 461 Ocean Blvd., Slowhand, Money and Cigarettes, and the rest of the drivel that he has cranked out through the years?  There is nothing more tragic than wasted potential and this album illustrates that Clapton squandered the majority of his career.  In my estimation, his salvation lies with immersion in the blues.  He needs to find a good, stripped-down sound and just play the s*** out of that tobacco sunburst Stratocaster.

B00AQL8VU4|5.0|The tablet works great. I hardly use my computer anymore. Faster than I thought it would be. One problem I've had is keeping connected to the Internet.
B004X2M9VY|4.0|This in my opinion is arguably the best sci-fi TV series ever.  Bar none.  If you haven't yet, just watch it and you'll agree.  But I gave this only 4 stars, because I don't like Matt Smith, the current Doctor Who.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's harder than I thought it would be.  Goes from easy to difficult.  Makes you think and plan yoour moves.
141659521X|4.0|With \\"The Last Man\\" besides a dandy story, the reader is given an inside look at covert operations inside the CIA.<br /><br />Someone has kidnapped the agency's top man in covert ops in Afghanistan. He has the names of the agency's spies throughout the area. If made to talk, it would be an intelligence disaster for the CIA.<br /><br />Mitch Rapp, the agency's top covert operative, investigates. When he arrives in Afghanistan and begins looking into the case, his life becomes at risk. The reader also becomes aware of a smear campaign against the money handling by Mitch and the missing agent.<br /><br />The action thriller demonstrates Vince Flynn's story telling ability as well as his excellent character descriptions. It also portrays the heroism of many CIA operatives in the field.<br /><br />The plot is original and the suspense is nicely maintained throughout the story.<br /><br />Recommended.
1449305172|5.0|Not only is Ash's writing style straight forward and easy to comprehend with the way he breaks down concepts and uses metaphors to explain things but I found that this book was riddled with actionable advice.<br /><br />Speaking as a business book junkie I can safely say that unlike 90% of the business books out there Running Lean actually has advice that you can (and should) take action on in each chapter.<br /><br />I have absolutely no affiliation with Ash other than having read and enjoyed the Lean Startup by Eric Ries as well and I'm happy to say \\"pick yourself up a copy, you won't be disappointed\\".
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This has worked perfectly for me.  I read any time any where I am.  I have fifty or more titles.  It takes no longer to read than on my regular Kindle.  If I forget to take it I have my android Kindle.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Most amazing book I have read in a long time. It is easy to connect with the characters in this book. Read it in one night because I couldn't put it down.
B0081336FO|5.0|The only bad thing I can say about this show is, there aren't enough episodes. I hope they have a 3rd series.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Now i am only giving it 5 stars because it is just Star wars<br />I am not really a big fan of how they package these things in cases like this but if it is the only way to get it like this then ok.<br />Now to me i am a huge fan but please stop after number 6. I really think it is bad they are going to make another movie number 7 come on really what else can they do.<br />Now that George Lucas sold out to Disney then oh well just another company Disney owns. I like this box set if they kept to the THX Stuff.<br />Now to me if you look really close at the last movie near the end you will see a new versions of the ghosts and to me that is just wrong<br />In all the movies i have seen in the Star wars I really dont like that because in the older versions and the original movies there was an old man<br />Sorry a bit of a critic, but on blue ray we will see<br />if you can find this great shop around I did that
B001ANSS5K|5.0|For the record, I am a 31 year old but I still love to read good YA fiction. John Green writes good YA fiction. This novel is well-written, the characters really come to life, and I honestly couldn't put it down. It's about love, friendship, growing up, teens' relationships with parents, and trying to be an individual among peers who eschew those who are different.
098555780X|4.0|I purchased this as a gift for my daughter.  I gave it to her and she seemed really happy for more projects with paracord crafts.
1439102813|5.0|This is a powerful novel that touches on multiple themes; family systems and dynamics, the intellectual culture, the fears and burdens of being a caregiver, but most of all, the terrifying experience of slowly descending into progressively worsening dementia, and knowing it.  The author demonstrates great writing skill and meticulous research.  It is very unsettling, but a powerful look at the world through the sufferer's eyes.  Very helpful for professionals and caregivers, but may be scary for patients and loved ones.
B008OW1SDY|5.0|Another album from Aimee Mann and my first one on vinyl.<br /> Nice packaging.Vinyl is clear and sounds great.<br />Worth getting.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|easy, fast, fun.  Best flash game I've played on a mobile device. Don't pass this one up, it's worth it.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I love this mouse, but since I came from an ordinary 3 button mouse.. it is taking me a while to learn how to use this one properly. I love that I could change the logo color and that it &#34;breathes&#34; - I think that is so neat. Was worth every cent!
B0063IH60K|3.0|I enjoy playing this but my issue is if you reach a point where there are no more moves, it still won't &#34;end&#34; the game.  It just sits there.  You have to go out and come back in or completely start a different hand. I have tried to figure out if there is just no score keeping on this game or why it does this but I haven't had any luck.  I figure there are probably better versions of solitaire out there.
B004RFYEEC|5.0|A comprehensive overlook of the album that every serious Beach Boys fan should have.<br /> You get a proposed finished album(follows B.W. 2004 version).This version uses the latest audio technology to insert vocals or music,<br />adding backgrounds to otherwise incomplete songs.Not all songs are finished though as they were not completed back in 66/67.<br /> But you can hear how close they were.<br />You get 5 cds,2 vinyl singles,2 vinyl records,a SmIle poster and a book(some pictures,history of the legend and points of view from the people of the time,past and present.<br /> One cd has the &#34;album&#34; and various versions of Smile songs and a Smile Backing Vocals Montage.<br /> A cd of &#34;Good Vibrations&#34; , a cd of &#34;Heroes and Villains&#34; and 2 cd's of  Smiles other songs(Windchimes,Cabin Essence,Vega-Tables etc).<br /> The vinyl sounds great,theres even more stuff on the vinyl besides the album.The box itself is pretty sturdy and has a &#34;3d&#34; effect<br />Smile Shop front.<br /> The best Beach Boy boxset yet.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Reminded me of child hood games, gave it a shot.  Too many ads, not enough fun.  Steer clear of this one.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|A detailed look at Lincoln's political life especially during the Civil war.  We view him as a strong man now, but then?
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Tis was a great read. I was surprised how much was different than the movie. I loved the ending. Can hardly wait to read more from this collection.
B0084O8OB6|5.0|Song sounds great on vinyl and its a different mix to the cd.<br /> Sleeve is a little flimsy.<br />If you must,get it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really good to keep you entertained and it is also  about the thought and he New update is really awesome I've already got 14 eggs!
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|Can't wait for the next and the next! Casted extremely well and the performance was equally as entertaining as the LOTR trilogy!
0784011710|1.0|I love movies and books about the sekend world war - but this was just as boring and long as the book!
B001TH16DS|5.0|If you have the dvd and wanna upgrade and you have the cash,tv,player etc,get it.<br /> The sound is awesome,the picture shows almost all the bad scenery and effects too clearly.<br />On the blu-ray you are given the option of  watching each episode with the original effects or new and improved digital effects done<br />for this release,amazing.<br /> Star Trek but not as we know it.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I think this book is hilarious and  Greg is really funny when he says It was hard for me to come up with a resolution for myself so my plan is to help other people make resolutions so they can become a better person.  Another phrase is it is a pity that Rodrick didn't make a resolution because his list should be about a mile long.  I think think this is an outstanding book for all ages and I would rate this a 5 star book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I know I was a skeptic at first when a couple of friends told me about this show, but please believe me when I say &#34;This show rocks!!&#34; I've been addicted to it since Episode 1!
B004ZG5F0K|5.0|Love this movie and the book! Read the book then see the film and you will be filled with information and compassion.
0307716988|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, give a little insight to Michael. I know he wrote another but really wish he had wrote many more so that we would have known him better
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a very usefull app and well worth downloading as a free app.  as a student its nice to be able to pull out my kindle and use a free calculator. it doesn't hurt to get it and can come in handy.
B000AL730O|5.0|While I prefer Sir Paul's more rocking material, &#34;Chaos and Creation in the Backyard&#34; is a great CD if you seek his more mellow, sentimental side. The only upbeat tune is &#34;Fine Line.&#34; The rest is for easy listening. In this case, Sir Paul fills the bill as only he can. Buy with confidence and enjoy.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I chose 5 stars because the characters actually MAKE this show amazing! I was bored and decided to watch the first couple episodes to pass time. In two days I devoured Season 1 & 2! You won't be disappointed.
1608871517|5.0|This book I could sit and read over and over. Loved all the pictures and the story's Bush through in there
B005GFPZYK|4.0|As someone who's SEAL knowledge basically consisted of watching BUDs on YouTube, this book was great! Really opened my eyes to the brutality of the Iraqi War and just what our men and women fighting overseas go through on a daily basis. Meant even more to know the man recently was killed, so sad. My heart and prayers go out to his family and friends.
B000HKYA1I|4.0|Funny, moving, shocking, tearful and oftentimes riveting. Can't say that about most of the stuff out there. A must see.
B000026OW3|5.0|Great CD. Totally worth the $. I continually listen to this even since ive bought it (which was like over a year ago).
0741470314|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this. Dr Moriarty gave great info about Michael. Plus with her from the same area I was born and raised in helped in wanting to read what she had to say.
B000VH3FV8|5.0|I am a avid Luther Vandross fan I was very pleased and surprise how the collections were sent to me.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|It was interesting to get an account of what happened, but the writing style was not very sophisticated.  The author is clearly not a writer by trade, but it was a decent read.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Tony is always excellent....not disappointed at all.  EXCELLENT!  Highly recommend this CD!!  I like his choice of partners....very diverse! WOW
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|This sucks. well I mean sure the blood is nice. I turned it off for a break and it deleted my progress. up until that point it's great.....
B000002H38|5.0|Anita Baker just love her voice such soothing  I would recommend this to everyone. She is one of the old school
B008N1V11U|1.0|I tired to contact facelift and no one would reply back. Does anyone know if there will be a update for the kindle fire h d?
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I lost my charger and cable during a trip and this buy save my life. This cable is very resistent and is made with quality materials
0767821769|5.0|This is soo good.  The movie is like real life stuff that goes on in peoples lives.  I believe you would enjoy it.  It makes you happy, sometimes sad and a lot of things to relate to.  I recommend this.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I liked how the words were and how it was. I recommend to not put the background white. It will get complicated.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My girlfriend and I have watched every episode from the beginning, and Season Three has ratcheted up the volume big time from Season Two.  The Zombie element aside (which the demise of some are over-the-top comical to say the least), the growth and maturity of the characters has been great to witness.  This show has a lot to offer... relief, happiness, discovery, dread, disappointment, horror, madness, and contempt... all rolled into one nice little environmental calamity complete with the Walking Dead roaming about aimlessly.<br /><br />We love it, and if you haven't seen the complete series... well, you've missed something iconic.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Love mlp but some things to fix:<br />1. Can't seem to visit anyone from game loft<br />2. Perhaps clearing items should be either one price, or, one gem. None of this  fluctuation.<br />3.greed. I get it making money is important.  But there is a point where the game will lack any fun if you seem so overly concerned with this. And the game currently seems OBSESSED with financial gain.  I know it will take a long time to accomplish things with out the users fiscal investment.  However,  when i calculate my possible purchase and it STILL adds to little to no gain in the game,  one cannot help but feel a bit cheated.<br /><br />I enjoy the game.  It is adorable!  But at least fix the Gameloft  friend adding issues.  Thank you.
B008Q08EV8|5.0|Loved it - thought it was a well done and great Roman flick! Will probably watch it again. Definitely a must see!
B00AEFY3MC|4.0|This is one of my favorite spoof movies, it's great for fans and non fans of Star Trek I recommend this movie to any science fiction fan or comedy fan.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Watched it 3 times in 48 hours.  May have to buy it for our own collection.  Great movie.  Would recommend.
1451683405|4.0|Short, but fun to read.
B003Y58CKS|3.0|I have song this opera twice and enjoyed myself. To see it as an audience allows me to appreciate both soloists and chorus. The performances on this dvd are in the top 2  of the 6 performances I have seen, including one at the Met in NY. Truly sad story with emotional singing bringing tears along the way. Great singing, lovely costumes, the set just as it should be. A winner.
B00138GY5I|5.0|Please find here in a generic review....This is great, its (insert band name here)!<br />amazon, thanks for carrying such a good assortment of music.<br />Amazon, make your rating system......less<br />I dont want to have to write a whole paragraph this early in the am for 1 album....:(
B00004Z3AV|5.0|I have always been a fan of Queen and feel that Freddy Mercury's voice was one of the most outstanding of all lead singers in bands of this era.  His music could get anyone moving' and groovin&#34;.  The more I listen to Bohemian Rhapsody, the more I love the arrangement.  Even if there were no vocals, this would be a beautifully composed piece of music.<br />If Queen is your thing, you can't go wrong with this set!
B0074VA2T2|4.0|Seeing this picture for this app brought me nostalgia, for I loved this book as a kid. When I was four this was my favorite book, and I was a bit surprised (though I shouldn't be) that almost twenty years later it is still one of the most popular out there, and has translated into the virtual market.<br /><br />With that being said, there are five levels in this game, level one being the easiest, and then it progressively getting a little more challenging, each one requiring more skill than the other. When you begin the game, there is automatically background music playing and an instructional voice that asks you to get the fruit, and how many times. However, you can turn off both music and voiceover if you like. In each level the number of fruits are also sequential, but from the options menu you can alter that as well, so it will be a random number of fruits instead of going from 1 fruit, 2 fruits, 3 fruits, etc.<br /><br />This game played great on my first generation Kindle Fire with no issues. So aesthetically, this game looks great and matches well with the book. At the end of the day, it is a pretty simple counting game. However, the age range says 'all ages,' but I am not sure if that is super realistic for those in the younger age range. In this game you have to follow instruction (from either the voiceover, written word, or both), and I am not sure how many three year olds have that patience. Also, after you are successfully eating the food, instead of it going to the next crop of food, you have to click the 'done' button. I think this is a good game for those who are, say, four-five years old or up, while parents should probably play with their children who are younger than that, so they can actually get through the game. I'm also not sure if it is worth the original price range, but it is up to the consumer.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|I really liked this one. Won't give too many details to avoid spoilers but I really thought this one was well done in all aspects.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|Ian Richardson was wonderful and I just loved his portrayal of a man who wanted political power at all costs including murder. Season I was truly superb. Season II was also good. Season III seemed to have lost its way and one found oneself only interested in just how he would fall from power. An assassination set up by his conniving wife at a ceremony honoring Margaret Thatcher was a little contrived but good riddance.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Easy read. Conner was a little Christian Grey like. Lol Great story. Looking forward to more reads from this author
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Still learning about the game. The graphics are pretty. I can't wait to go on with the adventure around the world!
B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|I was concerned that after the phenomenal first album, Born To Die, there will be a drop. It happened so many times before... However this album is pretty good. It is not as good as BTD but it has its moments. The first single, Ride, is an excellent track and others are pretty good too. Overall It's between 3 and 4 stars but I though 4 would be more appropriate because still this is an above average album.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I love every episode of The Game of Thrones and especially liked Season II. Cannot wait for Season III. wonderful acting. HBO has created a world that is forever intriguing and suspenseful
B002GTZSZU|3.0|Overall this is a great movie because of the scenery, costumes and most of all the music, which the real star of the performance.  However, the &#34;Director's Cut&#34; has some added scenes which actually degrade the movie, the most significant of which is a scene involving Mozart's wife and Salieri (which is the primary reason the Director's Cut has an R rating and the original is rated PG).  Therefore, I do not recommend the Director's Cut, only the original version.
B007H7XRLI|5.0|I've watched this movie several times and get new things out of it each time I watch it.  I admire the dedication that the actors put into training and maintaining while making this film. It does make you wonder if the gods do watch us and would they help us or are they so tied up into their own war in the heavens??
B00BBRPRDG|5.0|Poco is generally credited for starting the genre of country rock in earnest.\\"All Fired Up\\" demonstrates how the genre continues to evolve. On REGRET, Rusty Young offers up a wistful, haunting melody which could drop seemless into the classic \\"Legend\\" album. Yet on ROCKING HORSE, the band jams in fine Allman Brothers style. On bassist Jack Sundrud's HARD COUNTRY, an Americana feel underlies this excellent tribute to the family farm. Newest member Michael Webb adds THATS WHAT ROCK & ROLL WILL DO, an up tempo affair you could envision Bob Seger performing. All together, a very complete effort that demonstrates POCO is indeed a timeless band!
B000P0J09M|1.0|The DVD is of very poor quality.  Several times the screen goes black and the sound is muted.  I've been too busy to return it.
B006903GX8|1.0|This was a very enjoyable book.  It really opened my eyes to what the downstairs people had to go through and I never really<br />thought there was rank among the servants.  How interesting.  Also the upstairs people and their ranks.<br /><br />It was a good book.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|They should have been college age. Not high school. The story was interesting and kept me reading. Would read more of her work.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|The best way to keep, share and schedule tasks.  Organized by group and calendar sensitive to do lists across all platforms.  Handy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Right there when you need it. Does what it is supposed to do. Gets right answers. The price is right.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Considering the recent revelations of the cyber war underway between the US and China, it struck very close to home. A page turner.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good story. Moved along nicely without getting stuck too often. Wish it was longer but that's only because I liked it so much I wanted to keep playing. Worked great on my kindle fire.
B00846WWVM|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. Some levels are very challenging, but you can replay them over again to get a better score.  I really enjoy it and find myself playing it a lot.
B003WQT2YY|5.0|Superb  movie. F Murray Abraham was Academy Award winner for good reason. Mozart's wife seemed like a high school play actress - the only bad thing about this movie. I saw it in the theater when it first was released and enjoyed it even more the second time having picked up some of the details I missed earlier.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved the book. Right from the start it grabbed me and kept me captivated though the whole book. The writer really made the characters come alive. I recommend this to everyone!
B009NPKTN6|4.0|I liked it very much even though i think julianne hough is talentless wantabe all star and tom cruise is a useless actor who seems to be in everything these days it was a great movie
B0084AXZK0|4.0|I had read this book in high school about 44 years ago and found that I forgot most of it. The story kept my attention because I knew that Dorian died but could not remember how. The descriptive prose really helped to paint a picture of the times and the characters but I found myself wanting to skip over the parts that really didn't add to the plot or character development such as when he describes all of Dorian's tapestries etc. I gave it 4 stars for the same reason - beautiful descriptive prose that occasionally went overboard for my taste.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Very fun and mindless..I feel it is a challenge..At times i have to put it down as i cant figure out puzzle...
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|i love this game. it is completely addictive. i can play for hours trying to get farther than i did before.
B0001Z37HM|5.0|Red Sonja is one of my guilty pleasures, I love the movie for what it is... a low budget film that is just well done enough to inspire people to delve further into the genre.
B009VMN3RA|4.0|This book was so much better than I expected.  Thanks for taking the risk to share.  A page turn er for me. I spent a few nights saying up late to read more.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I'm not a fast reader,  but with this book I couldn't stop at times so interesting and lots of information if you are a runner you should get it, if not you also should get it. Again lots of information!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really like the game. I only have ads in between hands while I am playing. Never while I am playing or when I am not using the app. I just hit the skip ad button and I am good. I love the game anyway and am happy with it
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I like that i got this for free everyone should get this if you don't like it just delete it.
B0095P31L6|5.0|Great kids movie. Tons of action, and a great &#34;be yourself&#34; storyline that encourages kids to not put on a mask and be someone else, but to just be themselves to the best they can.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I gave it 4 stars because I like the first book in the series slightly better but if you read the first you have to finish  the series!  The series is a fun and clean read!

B0091Q82L8|5.0|If you loved &#34;Live at Leeds&#34; this is still a must for Who fans.  The room at Hull had much less echo and more warmth.  The first four songs lost the bass track and have the &#34;Leeds&#34; bass tracks somehow blended in.  My first impression is that it makes Moon's drumming sound awful and is a good case study for how tight these guys really were.  Townsend's guitar playing is incredible throughout--better than &#34;Leeds&#34;--and Moon, once reunited with Entwistle, is genius.  I found the bass track too faint for me and boosted it quite a bit for listening.  Highlights:  &#34;Tommy&#34; is the best ever!, &#34;My Generation&#34; is the only encore and a masterpiece, &#34;Shaking all over&#34; and &#34;Summertime Blues&#34;.  As with &#34;Leeds&#34; there are times when it seems impossible to believe that there are only three instruments being played.  Everything past the first four songs prove the rumor that &#34;Hull&#34; was the better performance.  We're lucky to have them both.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|tryed the book becouse a frend liked it & thought I wood.<br /><br />the book kept you wontting to know what was next.
B0038TRGSY|5.0|My daughter is doing a musical excerpt from this movie amd hadn't seen it before. We had a lot of fun watching it.  It's a musical that is silly, fun to watch, and with some great messages, too.
B0029XFN9O|5.0|So I told my son about this movie and he wasn't interested. but i got it anyway. He loves it now. good choice.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I just loved this book. I found it funny and endearing at the same time.  When she was fufilling her wishes I enjoyed every one!!  The mystery was great.  Her relationship with her neighbor was fantastic.  I couldn't put it down and was glad I had the opportunity to read it.!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I have read all of Mitch Alboms books. I loved and learned from each one. Time is really all we have, and we must use it wisely, with love for others. We must not waste the time we,'ve been given. Tim
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Excellent writing and acting. Engaging story. I just wish Amazon did not insist on charging members for the last season. Very unfair in my view.Amazon expects me to shell another $65.00 to watch season 4. Hulu does not do this to there members nor does Netflix.<br /><br />Amazon you are ripping off your members.
B009YQJ322|5.0|this is the greatest comic book adaption ever. Urban pegs Dredd and brings him to life. This movie rocks. I loved it
B005LAJ16I|1.0|I was glad I could get this past season of Homeland.  It is great.  I would sooner get a CD than subscribe to an on-line daily show.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen in years.  Funny and heartwarming and a true story to boot!  I absolutely loved every minute of it.
B00A757EFW|1.0|this version is a waste of time. the &#34;joy stick &#34; doesn't respond with your finger fast enough. i tried one level and couldn't get away from any of the ghosts because my little guy wouldn't move. i deleted it after about 20 minutes.
B008XG1X18|4.0|and of course, pinterest is everywhere now isn't it?  only got it because my daughter has been hounding me to get the silly thing; same goes for facebook:0
B00AQ30IRG|5.0|The Director's cut adds a more fleshed out version of the story and the commentary by Wiseman was informative and engaging.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|Robert Zemeckis has returned to live-action drama since \\"Cast Away,\\" about a man who survives a crash landing on a desert island. Now in \\"Flight\\" Denzel Washington plays a pilot Captain Whip Whitaker, who pulls off a near-impossible landing, saving the lives of most of the passengers and crew.<br /><br />Despite the suspenseful crash landing sequence, \\"Flight\\" is no more an action film than \\"Cast Away\\" is. Robert Zemeckis's new film focuses on the character Whip Whitaker, who, though hailed as a hero, has a secret that he desperately wants to keep from the people. We learn what the secret is right at the start of the film. In \\"Flight\\" an airplane accident serves only as a starting point for the story that follows, which is pretty predictable, but manages to keep us interested thanks to the star Denzel Washington's nuanced acting.<br /><br />The same cannot be said about the supporting characters, however. Bruce Greenwood and Don Cheadle deliver solid performances as a union representative and a lawyer respectively, but their characters are rather flat. John Goodman's comic relief and the romantic subplot involving a recovering heroin addict (Kelly Reilly) only make the film longer, not better.<br /><br />But the filmmakers have made one right choice and that is Denzel Washington. He does not disappoint, though I think the film itself does.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|fantastic film version of a fantastic stage production . saw this on the big screen and walked away in awe. i recommend the full screen instead of wide screen format.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|What an American Hero.  It is humbling to see what our troops experience to preserve out freedom.  RIP Chris. I pray for his family.
0805053883|3.0|My little one loves Brown Bear what do you see so when I saw this I thought it would be a great follow on. Instead, the rhymes are awkwardly constructed and do not flow nicely like its predecessor. If I had it to do over I would pass on this book.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I love this series and will continue to look for others written by this author! It gets better as the series progresses!
B007REV4YI|5.0|I love the movie, and I think it's the best Bond movie yet. You don't have to be a Bond fanatic to love it either. Great shipping and great cost from Amazon.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Worked right after installing and it was a lot of fun. Closed out to my home page and now I can't get back in. Needs an update fast!
B0036UO56G|5.0|This was the coolest movie ever back in the 70's. I remember watching the movie over 20 times. It rocks still.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|This is yet another masterpiece by Duane. I gotta' believe he's listenin' to it, braggin' on his little girl, Galadriel (who produced this collection) to the rock'n'roll heaven house band.<br /><br />You don't have to be a disciple of Skydog to get a lot of musical satisfaction out of it. You don't even need to be a fan of the Brothers or southern/blues/progrock or ethereal transcendental symphonic jams (i.e. Mountain Jam from Eat a Peach.)<br /><br />But if you are, and I am, this set is gonna touch you to the core.<br /><br />Its a thorough survey of Duane's work and some folks new to this master's recorded history may find some of the very early cuts dated, even cheesy. There were some mediocre producers and mangers and labels that stiffled the muse, mostly in the L.A. years. Things get better fast once the boys came back to the South and were able to express their roots.<br /><br /> If you are a casual observer of this great musician, I'd suggest starting in the middle (chronologically speaking) then go back and listen to the formative stuff.<br /><br />If you are deep into the Bros. or Duane or Greg try to listen through starting at disc #1 reading along. I had several fresh insights and I've been studying this slide wizard since 1974. It really tells the story of how the style came to be.<br /><br />The book is essential to the set, so read along. Not perfectly linear or in sync with the playlist, neither is life.<br />Pay attention to the personnel and you'll see how the Allman Brothers Band formed (organically) over a few short years.<br /><br />I thank God for Duane Allman and his burning desire to make great music. He left an extensive legacy of superb guitar work.<br />What a treasure. Thanks Galadriel, you done your papa proud.
B0049P1ZZQ|4.0|The show is great, but it is cheaper because there are only 6 shows in the first season, so I breezed through those pretty quick.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Fun for the whole Family! We have three boys 10, 6, and 2. This is a movie they can all sit down and enjoy.
B0056C6XIA|4.0|Ok, this is a great tool, and it's got everything you might need, only 1 con, but it prevented me from giving it 5 stars.  When you slide out one of the devices, like the knife for example, it has a locking feature to prevent the tool from going back in, great idea, BUT in order to unlock it to slide it back into the handle, you have to move the little slide up/down and this seems very difficult to do.  I usually end up using my finger nail & it's not and easy thing.  It looks like you'd be able to just grab the slide with 2 fingers but it doesn't move easily.  Maybe this was their design on purpose, but if so, they should have made it just a little easier.<br /><br />Otherwise VERY great tool, excellent for camping & I'm a musician, use it to restring guitars & fix my childrens toys & to fix fishing line.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I watched this with my 8 year old last week and we both loved it. I loved all the old call backs to classic video games and the loved the characters and the story. This was a beautifully made movie and I hope they make a sequel.
B00AFEYUVG|4.0|I thought the movie was decent, I was really expecting more considering the great revies, but it was a solid movie. Great price and shipping was quick from Amazon.
B00275EGX8|2.0|Very happy with delivery and up until now the quality all past products purchased. This was the first time I viewed this new DVD and this is what happened, &#34;DVD continually stops while playing.&#34;
B003V3FVKC|5.0|My son was the one who braught this movie to my awareness.  I had heard of it when it was in the theaters, but had forgotten it had come out on dvd.  I was pleasantly surprised when I viewed it for the first time.  I was not aware of how family oriented it was.  It left me with a warm fuzzy feeling that is rare these days.  Sandra Bullock is exceptionally good as a southern woman of prestige.  She is the driving force behind the whole movie.  I was very impressed how this movie kept most of it's origins truthful.  Sometimes it doesn't make for a very interesting movie, but in this case, I think it lended a certain level of curiosity that kept me wanting to watch it to the end.  I give it a thumbs up all the way.  Anyone who loves college football, or strong families sticking together, will appreciate this movie.
B0056BU3I2|4.0|Although my all time favorite was Fast & Furious 4, this sequel is a close 2nd and was exciting and full of what F&F fans love...cars!
B00270WH3Y|5.0|How can you go wrong with Simon and Garfunkel.  I have the vinyl version but this is a very good collection of MP3 format songs
B003U53GK8|5.0|It was hard to see it all and after lost have my heart you start. After all the survivors went through to end it like that was just amazing. There was a few things at work unexplained near the very end of the show (the very last episode), but us being the viewers we can fill them and according to what we already know. The very last episode had me in tears. The whole thing was just an amazing adventure go through. The show really make me feel as if I was there, and when it finally ended felt like I lost a part myself.<br /><br />Rating:<br />I gave it a 5 star rating because it was a really good closer to an amazing show.<br /><br />I would recommended show it to anyone like to get really into their shows. if you like really getting to know your characters and watching every episode this is definitely the show you. 1 thing I have to warn you about, if you miss an episode you are literally going to be lost.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I've deliberately watched movies like this (&#34;Save The Last Dance&#34; springs to mind) in the past, but the dance-contest / singing-contest quasi-musical isn't my go-to genre. I've never seen an episode of &#34;Glee...&#34;<br /><br />That said, I enjoy the formulaic elements of this genre because they make good stories: there's always at least one outcast character struggling (often against themselves) to find their tribe, there are usually larger stakes hanging over the centerpiece competition than just winning or losing, there has to be a love story b-plot, and so on.<br /><br />&#34;Pitch Perfect&#34; checks off on all of that, and adds elements from other popular genres -- the &#34;gang o' girls&#34; and &#34;over-the-top gross-out comedy&#34; niches, with just a touch of &#34;hey, go with it, it's a movie&#34; -- and that gives this &#34;little&#34; movie some extra pizzazz.<br /><br />Anna Kendrick did this film on the heels of the excellent &#34;50 / 50,&#34; and it might be the first time she's unequivocally the lead. She gets points for steering away from type by choosing the kind of movie most actors' filmography lists at the beginning of their career, not after Oscar and Tony nominations. As always, she's engaging and magnetic.<br /><br />Rebel Wilson, the scene-stealer roommate in &#34;Bridesmaids&#34; (which shares a distributor and, if you look at the one-sheet, probably marketing team, with &#34;Pitch Perfect&#34;) has a lot more to do in this movie, and that's a wonderful thing.<br /><br />But all the funniest, craziest lines belong to Hana Mae Lee... if you listen carefully. (An aside from a storytelling perspective: the gradual growth of Hana's character, and the way that change is demonstrated in the movie, is one of the most subtle examples of character arc I've seen in a long time, especially for a supporting character, and points to the extra care that went into &#34;Pitch Perfect.&#34;)<br /><br />Finally, although the Hugh Jackman &#34;Les Miserables&#34; is getting all the attention, it's my understanding that &#34;Pitch Perfect&#34; is another film where the actors are doing their own singing, and they're doing it on-camera, in the scenes they're acting. That's pretty nifty.<br /><br />&#34;Pitch Perfect&#34; is worth a rental. I might even spring for the DVD. These days, that's saying something!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|The only reason I continued with the series was to find out more about the characters, and less about their sexual proclivities.  I found it extremely redundant...use of the same words for inner thoughts.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Can't stop playing this game. If you like the challenge & have the time, then this is the game for you.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I LOVE this game!  It's relaxing but at the same time it can be quite challenging.  I really enjoy these types of games...a gr8 way to kill time by doing something that requires a bit of skill.  Absolutely 5 stars!  Awesome game...thank you dev/devs :)
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I love this man and have done since early 80's.  Watched it on a flight to WA Christmas 2012 and was<br />in tears through most of it.  Really enjoyed it and had to buy it.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Enough with the sex already.  I found myself skimming to get out of the bedroom and get more into the characters themselves.  The author has a great ability to draw one in, but then fell flat on letting us really know the characters and why they had the hang-ups they had.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun to play. Good way to kill time. Ads go away after you play for a while. It's all good.
B00846WWVM|4.0|It's a fun game...there are similar ones out there, but I've always wanted this one.  Quite enjoyable, thanks dev/devs :)
B006LSZECO|4.0|I have never read anything by this author, and was pleasantly surprised.  If you enjoy Agatha Christies style of writing, you'll enjoy this. I will say that the beginning of the story was kind of dull, so if you can get past the first couple of chapters, you'll really enjoy this book!
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I was excited when this cd was announced and I pre ordered it immediately and waited patiently for the release day to come and I can say the wait was worth it. This was a very good cd and hope David Bowie tours for this album and hope he decides to put out more new music in the future and hope we don't have to wait another decade to hear new music from him. Buy this now
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Save your money unless you want an app to take pictures of your nose.  The Kindle is great for reading and watching but not for taking pictures, the lens is at the bottom of the viewing screen so you can Skype with it , to take a picture of something other than your face you must hold it at an awkward angle and try get a shot . Its a waste.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Fun and engaging for all who play, I would recommend this to anyone who likes these kinds of games.Enjoy and have fun.
B00846WWVM|5.0|An interesting game with the same engaging aspect as angry birds. Definitely will be an addicting new favorite. I can't wait to see where the levels take me.
B006O6F932|3.0|My 6 year old had to have so I bought this for her. I have seen this in stores for almost $90 and it is not even close to being worth the money. I bought this for $60 on amazon and I still don't  think it's worth that but my daughter loves it. Instructions are not great. It has a bunch of small pieces that are choking hazards so be careful. It does collapse for easy storage and portability. It came with sticker sheet but says no where on what they are for so I put them to the side and that's where  they still are as I try to figure out if they are just stickers or they are meant to be stuck some were certain. Do I recommend it  I would say yes if you wanna make a child happy and put a smile on there face.
B0002TJGQS|3.0|I use it for a remote to light battery candles.  I have to replace the battery once a month which seems too often.  Good thing I bought a 5 pack
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We are newbies to the series but caught the first 2 seasons on Netflix then had to see the last full season. We see a lot of gore and feel that sometimes it crosses the line but other than that all the characters are well developed and have obvious good and bad points just as we all do. This is a major contributor to the series as we all wonder how we would react when faced with the scary situations the people on the show are and we project our own choices onto the stars and are pleasantly surprised when they respond similarly to the way we think that we would.  The quality and creativity are all realistic and you never see artificial seeming details like clean faces and pristine hairdos. We gave it 5 stars for entertainment though I do not think this program is for children.
B0045XICB2|5.0|Excellent...Followed the book pretty well. The effects were awsome. Love all the movies and books. Hope she continues. Jocob and their daughter could be an interesting story.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I love this show! I cannot wait for season three to start, I can't wait to get to see more dragons and what's going to happen after that awesome season two finale!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|SUCH A GREAT game I am so happy I found this game and now I can't turn it off . A job well done!
B003EYVXTQ|4.0|The Blu-Ray arrived in A-1 condition and I had always wanted to see this beginning movie of one of my favorite actresses.<br />The movie was gritty and made me see how she earned her praise as a new performer.
0307001369|4.0|I actually thought I was getting the &#34;big book&#34; for this but I love Richard Scarry so was happy with the purchase.<br />I love the books because they are interactive with the reader..had them for my kids and now for the grandkids.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|its is ok but all the buttens are confusingly hard to manage. not for little kids its not kid friendly.
0385343175|5.0|I enjoyed the book from the first page through to the very last.  I enjoy Danielle Steel's books.  I have bought and read many of her books.
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|As usual great music from Bon Jovi! The cd is worth it! Good sound quality, and one you'll listen tto over and over.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|In short: if you liked the previous Bale Batman movies, you will like this. Sadly the Joker (Heath Ledger) went and died so he's not in this one, but even without the Joker this movie is terrific. Christopher Nolan has put together a trilogy that will stand for years and years. Bale is a believable Batman, even if his voice gets more and more hoarse over time! A perfect BD with amazing audio and video.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Just amazing game and very happy that I could play a game like this on the kindle<br /><br />If you like Diablo then get this game
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this game helped me pass time easily at the airport and in the many hotels i was in..my kids love it too .. we had to &#34;hid&#34; the app since my son was getting addicted and was interfering with his character..we allow him to play once a month..
B009UX2YAC|2.0|This is the same version as the last other then a little different colors,I'm not impressed. They need to make this more challenging. Make it difficult.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|No, but you get true Alien vibes in this movie. I saw this in 3D in the theater and liked it. 2D is just as great. Some people hate this movie, but I find it very nice. Good acting by Swedish Noomi Rapace (even if her &#34;British&#34; accent is very Swedish at times), and Michael Fassbender. Great audio and video presentation makes this one a must.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|As always Platrix has a winner. Absolutley great graphics. Similar to Call of Atlantis it's an enjoyable match 3 game with a great story. A game that is challenging &amp; relaxing. Even better I got it as the free app of the day.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|we have now watched Toy Story 3 at least 3 times and my kids are still asking to get the movie and watch again..i think i will get DVD/Blue Ray so that they can watch anytime they want
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Fun little free version of the game, good for wasting time while you're stuck waiting (at the doctor's, etc.). There are a lot of ads that pop up for paid versions of the game, but it's not so much it aggravates you.<br /><br />I was actually impressed with the resolution of the game on the Kindle Fire and the responsiveness of the touchscreen.
B007REV4YI|5.0|It seems like either you like the old &#34;funny&#34; Bond or either you like this new, Bourne-like Bond. I like the latter. No toys and one-liners are a minimum. Skyfall is almost as great as Casino Royale. We shall not even mention Quantum of Solace. Great Bond-flick, with a Bond-style super-villain. Good acting, and altogether a really great experience, with perfect video and audio.
B008476HBM|5.0|Classic book. Found it very interesting and delightful. Would recommend to anyone. Jane Austen  is an excellent writer.. Try it you will enjoy it.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Seriously, how can you not like Christmas Vacation?  For the price it was impossible to beat.  I look forward to the holiday deals next year!
B008NMT684|5.0|Wish some apps were availble for my phone as well but atleast one twin has something to do. no more fighting.
B00B2DSIAI|1.0|love this movie but I ordered it through amazon to play on instant video and it wont play. I am hoping to get a refund it was pretty upsetting.
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|Wow.  And I don't mean to bore you with details, so I won't.  But there's a lot of ground to cover.<br /><br />First, some context.  Believe it or not, I never read or was read \\"The Hobbit\\", though I own it on audiobook (but I keep falling asleep while it's playing).  I also never bothered to watch any of the \\"Star Wars\\" movies (no, none of them).  Therefore, I have no comparison point to the book or Jar Jar Binks which everyone else seems to want to throw this under.  I did watch the extended editions of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, and I will do some comparatives there.<br /><br />For those that don't know the book, this has actually little to do with the book itself.  In fact, while it shares the name and the basic premise, there is a lot of fluff thrown in for 'good' measure.  It is important that you approach this movie the way I did: It is essentially a prologue to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, a device to help explain what happened before the \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\".  While the book is supposed to be the same, there were a lot of missing elements in the story due to J.R. Tolkien not living long enough to get everything tied up.  His son tried, but this movie is really the first time we see the puzzle pieces fitting together.  The end result is rather confusing, so try best to follow along.<br /><br />The movie begins with a voiceover from Bilbo Baggins, who is writing what will eventually be \\"There And Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale\\", seen at the end of the \\"Return of the King\\".  What he is speaking is found in the letter that he has left for Frodo at the end of his adventure.  It then goes to the now infamous starting line from the book: \\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit...\\" and the whole first few sentences.  It then goes to a brief conversation between Bilbo and Frodo (yes, Elijah Wood).  This culminates into a first meeting with Gandalf, and the dwarves who are embarking on an adventure.<br /><br />I had a number of problems with how thisstarted.  It felt like Jackson was trying desperately to match what was said in the book - down to the corny diatribe from Gandalf to Bilbo - even though none of it matched the character.  Yet, the full duration of the movie is full with blatant attempts to be a prequel to \\"Lord of the Rings\\".  As such one would expect somewhat clear personality similarities, especially with Gandalf, that simply aren't there in the first parts of the movie.  Secondly, while I wasn't as upset with the dwarf-at-hobbit-hole scene as other reviewers, I had tons of questions.  Why are they not questioning their being sent there?  Why are they simply trusting of Gandalf that this hobbit is the right person?  And why was Bilbo so eager to join the squad?  Again, from what little I recall from the story, Bilbo is constantly reluctant to go on the adventure the entire time.  Yet in the movie this is brushed off as just a brief hesitation.<br /><br />Once the real adventure begins, the movie starts a sharp divergence from the story.  It still keeps certain elements but there are many others that were simply patched in from other Tolkien stories such as \\"The Silmarillion\\" and \\"Unfinished Tales\\".  For example, there isn't a serious session with Saruman and Galadriel with Agent Lord Elrond, with Saruman chewing Gandalf out for making the party (BTW, when Elrond said \\"purpose\\", he WAS Agent Smith.  Poor Hugo).  There's no epic battle with Albino orcs.  The list goes on and on, and clearly the intent is to maintain the same level of majesty found in the trilogy, so it's understandable why fans of the book might be miffed at some of what's thrown in, nevermind exposing certain characters that were never in \\"The Hobbit\\" to begin with (aka Frodo and others).<br /><br />The remainder of the movie is wrought with the same amount of orchestral marching scenes panning gorgeous landscapes in New Zealand as are found in the trilogy.  Thinking of this movie in a different angle, you might not expect this since the book itself is quite short and not the epic adventure that the movie portrays it to be; this is precisely why I say that you must set aside that expectation before approaching the movie.  Seen as simply a prequel to the trilogy, everything makes perfect sense and obviously that's how Jackson saw the endeavor.  He wasn't trying to turn the book literally into the movie (though the first 30 minutes would convince you otherwise).<br /><br />Much has been made of Radagast the Brown.  Turned from a couple of colorful sentences in the book to a larger-than-life character, Radagast's parts could easily have been excluded entirely.  He adds nothing to the story except finding a certain sword that is shown to Saruman (and thus dismissed as unverified).  I didn't have as much issue with how the character was presented with bird droppings in his beard and down the side of his face; indeed, most book-to-movie attempts result in the exact same (see \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" by Disney as a perfect example).  As with the aforementioned, if the target is to appeal to the children that read the book rather than the child that is now an adult watching the movie, sometimes it's better to leave well enough alone.<br /><br />Regarding the Blu-ray...my TV, an Insignia that I got about 3 years ago at a really good deal, has the ability to closely emulate the 48fps that the movie was presented at in theaters; just not in 3D (I hate 3D).  So I was able to experience the \\"speed\\" of things that people were talking about.  The best way I can describe it would be like a play, or a live action event where you are watching things right there on set while they're filming it. It didn't bug me too much since Back to the Future Blu-ray did the same thing at times, but where it got weird is any scene that was filmed with obvious fake props.  The most notable I saw was a scene where they panned over a landscape that was obviously not real; fake trees stuck into fake grass rather than a real area.  Also, when Gandalf is talking to Galadriel, the pillars to her left and right were too fake looking.  Gandalf himself, it was just seeing Ian McKellen in makeup all the time, unlike the trilogy where he blended into the character so well.  Overall, the quality was so clear and clean that you were easily able to see such imperfections and it took you out of the movie, combined with this new filming speed.<br /><br />If I had to name my biggest complaints, it would be the fight scenes; every last one of them.  They're all the same: party gets stuck into some sort of impossible situation with enemies twice or larger their size.  Even with so many dwarves they still manage to get beat down and either tied up, incapacitated, or stuck.  In every situation except one, Bilbo is the one that saves them.  This is stark opposite of the trilogy where Frodo didn't do hardly anything.  In fact Frodo was more of a coward than Bilbo in the movie even though the book has Bilbo being less willing to chip in and save the day.<br /><br />Then there is the introduction of Bilbo to Gollum.  A lot of people applaud this as the best scene in the movie, but frankly it was nothing special.  The Gollum character was played well, and the creepy mannerisms are something to behold, but the scene itself was quite unremarkable.<br /><br />Frankly, it was not a bad movie nor was it too long.  I didn't get the same sense of overall fulfillment from it that I got from Fellowship, nor did I gain much from the Bilbo character here.  Bilbo in the trilogy was a lot more entertaining overall, and \\"The Hobbit\\" at times felt mislabeled; as though it should have been called \\"The Dwarven Quest\\" because they dominated the screenplay almost exclusively.  This might have been in response to complaints about Frodo and Sam dominating the trilogy; I'm not sure.  In any case, as long as you don't bring book bias the movie is worth a watch.  But don't expect it to blow you away.  It's a decent movie, not a great one.<br /><br />If you buy the Blu-ray be sure to opt for the triple set with 3D Blu-ray, regular Blu-ray, and DVD.  It was 2 bucks more than the non-3D version.  If you do get a 3D TV in the future then you'll already be set.  I wouldn't worry about the extended edition unless you're so fan clouded you must have it, but I felt the movie was quite long enough.
0307346617|5.0|Max Brooks is the one and only source you should turn to for information regarding the zombie apocalypse (yes, I know it's unlikely, but it is fun to think about).  This book is wildly entertaining and Brooks does a great job of showing humanities struggles against an enemy completely unknown!
B0042RJWTC|5.0|One of my all time favorite purchases.  I had to force myself to stop watching more than 2 or 3 episodes at a time because so I could enjoy it over a longer period, otherwise I probably would have watched every single episode from start to finish.  It's so engrossing and so beautifully done.  I get lost imagining myself in that time period with this series.  Excellent!
B003O86FMW|5.0|More intricate in nature, this book shows us a far more deadly Katniss, a horrifically cruel Capital, and the swell of a true rebellion in the distance. Lovely and twisted.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It kept me engaged. It was a bit contrived at the end. Interesting spiderweb of lies and deceit. Some unexplained entanglements.
B007MAETA8|5.0|I've been a John Mayer fan since &#34;Inside wants out&#34; and I truly believe this is his best whole CD yet.  Yes, even better than Continuum.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Compared to other similar titles like Dragonvale, it's a lot more money-grubbing.  You can get every dragon in Dragonvale without buying it.  That's not the case here.  You're always grinding for food and coin, where other games it isn't quite so bad.  This is true across all of Lava's games.
B007MCTTHY|2.0|Not really my favorite app to date, but not too bad.  I only played it a couple of times.  Just didn't grab me.  I deleted it.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|would recomend this cd for everyone who loves good music and a singer with a phenomanal voice. it's a shame we don't appreciate him like they do overseas.
1401216676|5.0|remember first reading this astonishing book about ten or so years ago around when I first got into comic books. Up until that point I had just read typical mainstream super-hero fare with stories where a bad guy is introduced, commits his crime, and the good guy takes him out. status quo remains in place and everybody goes home happy.<br />Then I chanced upon this book, not even yet knowing who Alan Moore or Brian Bolland were and was completely blown away! This was a story that mattered. The event's of this book changed the character's in ways that they could never go back, and that's a very rare and good thing in comics. Never has a comic book so brilliantly dug so deep into the nasty bowels of the Joker's mind like this. You see the events that lead up to him going over the top and becoming the criminal who would one day be Batman's arch foe. Then we have Joker's confrontation with Batgirl which would forever change the character's in the Bat books and go on to really show just how insane and demented the Joker actually is. Personally, every time I read it, I can't wait to get to the end of the story when Batman get's his hands on the clown for one of my favorite fight sequences ever! You know a man can write when he get's you feel that much hate for a fictonal character!<br /><br />A first rate story, from a first rate creative team. This story is only second to The Dark Knight Returns.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Great show, the way it's done is so real so as to seem like we were actually there in the 1960's
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|This game could be fun...if it worked right. Only loads about half the time and the water park has never loaded (currently at level 14). Wastes much more time than these games usually do, as it struggles to simply load the game/ crashes anytime I try to load the water park
B007EECSFA|5.0|I had been searching for an entertaining, well-crafted story and I truly found it in reading &#34;The Secret Keeper&#34;.  I was already aware of the author's habit of switching from one decade to another point of time in her chapters, so I wasn't surprised or dismayed when Ms. Morton continued in that manner.  The author developed her main characters well and threaded &#34;the secret&#34; throughout the entire story.  It was fun for me to try to sleuth the clues in the drama between the characters.  Even though I am quite good at guessing how stories end, the author had me baffled right to the conclusion of this fun novel. Other family members have read the book as well and enjoyed it as much as I did.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Great season of what's become one of my favorite shows. Its funny and the strwaming quality of amazon is really good. The best part is no commercials.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|Excellent. Puts you right back in the islands. Very soothing and enjoyable. Close your eyes and Iz will take you to an undending luau.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|For some reason the movie stopped 3 times. I tried Netflix streaming while I was having problems and could not duplicate the issue. The movie was good.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My kids watch this movie at least twice a week.  My 4 year old son regularly sings one of the songs &#34;How bad can I be&#34;, which is very catchy.  Definitely recommend this movie to anyone with kids.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Pudding Monsters is a great game for all ages with just enough challenge to keep your attention. Definitely worthy of five stars. Zeptolab has done it again!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I've heard about the almost cult like following that this show has, but never took the time to watch it. After watching the show, I understand why people enjoy the show. Great story lines and character development. Definitely recommend.

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Wow<br />It is a great place to get your anger out but also game you cant stop playing. The only resonen I wouldnsay I didn't like itnis because to get somethings it cost jewels and jewels coast money.
B008I34ZQG|5.0|From the album opener to the very last note, FZ and band treat the listener to excellent musicianship and Zappa's unique perspective on various aspects of life and the weirdness to which some people subscribe. This album features tracks that are also on the &#34;Does Humor Belong In Music&#34; DVD and can only be described as Zappa and company in rare form. A must have for the Zappa enthusiast and a great introductory disk for the novice soon-to-be Zappa fans &#34;Trying To Grow A Chin&#34;.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|This book is great I can relate to in so many ways this book is worth the money<br /><br />  Best book ever

B002WV5A9G|5.0|What isn't there to like about this movie! It is the thrill ride of the century! Even as I write this which is only to get out my physics class I can only be stupefied by the physics in the movie! I cannot believe we already have the technology to transport between planets! I cannot
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Compelling and riveting and deserving of the Academy Award. I watched it several times and shared with friends and family.

B007BVOEPI|5.0|This is such an amazing series! I think anyone can get into it :)  It's so complex and such a unique world that they live in!
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|I usually don't go for games, but I put this on a kindle we have for our toddler granddaughter thinking she would be fascinated by the music and cool graphics. I found myself endlessly playing it!
B000I5X81K|5.0|When I first heard his voice, it awoke in me a passion for his type of music. There are many things that help an individual &#34;awake&#34; from an otherwise dull existence, but, when you hear him sing, it is for me an awakening to God.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is terrific, especially for fans of match-3 games.  But it offers more, including terrific graphics and an entertaining story line.  Sooooo glad I snatched this up as a FAOTD.  I will definitely be checking out other Playrix games in the future.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Well done! Constantly at the edge of my seat to the end of this heart felt gripping story. A must for your reading list!

B0042JTDXK|5.0|I am a fan. I could adopt him. He has a way of putting light into a persons life. When you listen to him and you close your eyes to meditate, you not only hear his voice, you see God's light shining on you.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|These developers have done a good thing and brought a needed App to many platforms - works well and you can download for use off line as necessary.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The book was not what I expected. It did not go into detail enough to prove to the average person what he saw.
B003E33LYW|5.0|I bought this as a vinyl LP when it first came out. When I played it for the first time on my floor speakers I was not impressed. Like most people, I was expecting something more like the traditional TYA sound. This most definitely is not it. Having spent $4.99 on the thing, I wasn’t going to not listen to it at least one more time before I put it in the “Sell Back” pile.<br />Everything changed when I listened to it on headphones. Even to this day, most LP’s could be recorded in Mono, as no one is willing to spend the money or time on production. They must have spent a ton of money and time on this recording. When two people are singing background, one plays in the left ear, and one in the right. If four instruments are playing, two are on one side, one on the other side, and the featured instrument plays on both so it sounds like it is in the middle. And instruments will bounce from side to side. Even to this day it has spoiled some of my enjoyment in other LP’s that do not use stereo to its’ full advantage.<br />After a few time listening to this for what it is, and not trying to fit it into the TYA model I initially was hoping for, it became one of my “must have” LP’s.<br />I did delete the Mono version of “Hear Me Calling”. For all the work the engineer did on this LP, Mono is just sacrilege.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I haven't finished reading it yet, but it really holds my interest and emotional. Sitting on the edge of my seat, waiting what happens next.
B00BN2NQFU|5.0|I have seen around 5 versions of Cirque. A traveling company, &#34;O' in Las Vegas and 2 in Floida<br /><br />The movie surpasses the live show if possible! &#34;O&#34; mostly used water so does the movie.<br />While there the usual strange &#34;words&#34; with the music, they played  some Beatles songs.<br />I might be telling some information that  you  already know. The words that are used are not actually part of any language.<br /><br />I have only watched the movie one time but I plan to watched a lot because I will see something that I didn't see before
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|This was one of my favorites as a child, and still want to read it again. It does bring back memories
B0085KGHI6|5.0|This was a great video with one of the greatest bluesman that ever played.  Oh yea, and the Stones were good too.  I suggest buying this DVD.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|this book kept your attention from beginning to end.  Elizabeth is a high spirited woman that was searching for someone to complete her life and logan was showed up trying to put the pieces together in his life and listening to victor's voice telling him that her picture was his lucky charm.  Nichlas sparks is the best.
B004W25KKW|4.0|Very descriptive and interesting view into the world of competitive memory events.  Foer does a good job introducing the characters in this arena and memory improvement techniques.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Yes, I would  tell everyone to read some of this author;s books.  You will enjoy so much.  I will continue to read this author.

B001TXQH68|5.0|This music always makes me feel good. But it also stimulates my mind with the artistry of all these musicians.
B009D7CP2M|3.0|I would like to give this book more than three stars, simply because it's such a compelling read and is brilliantly written. However, the characters and storyline are implausible to the point that I just had to bump it down from the five I usually give a book that is as mesmerizing as this. The father in this book is naive (or in denial) to such an extreme as to be unbelievable, and the mother's acceptance of this denial and willingness to go along with her husband (despite her own conviction about her son's apparent soullessness and numerous warning signs of his depravity) are equally unbelievable, not to mention frustrating. Despite all of this, I would still actually recommend this book....it raises enough important issues and food for thought to make it worthwhile, not to mention the fact that it is a (horrifyingly) enthralling read.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Great ensemble cast.<br />Easy watching.<br />Interesting story lines<br /><br />Characters well written and well acted.<br /><br />Wouldn't miss it<br /><br />Thanks, thanks, thanks,thanks,thanks,
B009AMAM9S|5.0|...especially after only a single viewing.  Like fine wine, it will improve with age and more sampling.  I predict that it will stand the test of time and eventually be labeled a classic or at least, a cult classic.    I knew very little about this movie, but was intrigued by the trailer, stars, and Wachowskis.  I loved the Matrix trilogy and the themes that it touches upon on top of the brilliant visual style.  I also liked V for Vendetta, so just seeing the trailer and the W's involvement was enough.  I didn't do any research either except to read that Natilie Portman read the novel and told the Wachowskis about it.  I have not read the novel yet, but will after seeing the movie.  I have since read reviews of the book and they generally follow the same sentiments concerning this film; both the good and the bad.  Non-linearity and unconventional story-telling or film-making generally do not equate to succe$$ and are almost always met with mixed reviews.    My initial reaction to the film was confusion due to the jumps between story lines, but I found that the movie began to make sense and became more engaging as it progressed.  When it was over, I found myself thinking that I loved it, but also that it definitely needed more than one viewing.  Subsequent viewings have and will continue to be even more rewarding (like noticing the same art-work in different locations/times).  Isn't that one of the things that constitutes a great movie?  Along with sticking with you long after you leave the theater and/or giving you much to talk about after verses forgetting what you saw an hour later.  Why own it if you won't watch it more than once?    I certainly hope that this film makes money or at least breaks even; if only so that future movies can be made from \\"unfilmable\\" stories.  Critical acclaim and box office receipts do NOT a great epic make.  At worst, Cloud Atlas will end up a cult classic along the lines of other box-office failures like Blade Runner, Fight Club, Brazil, Office Space, Bringing Up Baby, Donnie Darko, Reservoir Dogs, Wizard of Oz, and Citizen Kane.    (For more on the making of the movie, see [...] )
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|This one started out so great that I was hooked from the first paragraph.  However, the last 100 pages started to drag.  Far too much description of the characters moves from one place to another.  In addition, I thought the ending was a little too far fetched!
B002NNCAJQ|5.0|This is the GREATEST movie ever for getting motivated if you are in the sales field.<br />Not to mention the greatest lineup of casts ever as well.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I watched both seasons when they aired, and love the show- researching on Blu-Ray is a completely different (and better) experience.  The detail is amazing.  The books are great too.
B004WR125O|5.0|Easy to install and configure. Set and forget. Brings new features to your Onkyo receiver by connecting it to your wireless network for Internet content.
B00000425R|5.0|This is a wonderful recording!  If you love Corelli - it is a must have.  If you don't know Corelli - buy it and you will love it too!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Even though I am not a huge fan of the additional story that came up in season 3, it's still a great show.  Happy Zombie watching!
B003V4AK8E|1.0|Huge dead zones on the left stick, right stick is almost unusable. Input lag and random disconnect from the wireless dongle. Very poorly made for something almost as expensive as an official controller.
B0086700CM|3.0|Nothing against the game but it's not something I enjoy. It requires making the guy jump over obstacles and I get aggravated!! Probably others that enjoy this type of game would like it.
B00AO686MY|1.0|The first one I received would not get past the &#34;Touchstone&#34; title screen. The only way to stop it is to eject the disc. So I returned it and asked for a replacement.<br />I received the replacement today, 03/20/2013. It does the same thing - gets to the &#34;Touchstone&#34; title screen and won't go any farther. My Blu-Ray player is only 2 years old and has no trouble with any other Blu-Ray discs.<br />I wouldn't recommend buying this Blu-Ray.
B005QUQ99K|5.0|Couldn't find this anywhere. My son is 9 years old and is thrilled with legos.  My son loved it.  Thanks
B000TO0TCQ|5.0|It was very entertaining and suspenseful!  You don't know what will happen until you read the end!  I would recommend this book and other Alex Rider books.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|If you are looking for a top of the line processor, this is not what you need to buy - but for average needs this is a great processor. It does everything good and I have no complaints about it for the price, this is an awesome value. The FM2 socket will also be getting at least two more generations of processors, so I will be able to re-use my motherboard if I ever want to just upgrade the processor and RAM.<br /><br />This is the high end of the 'Trinity APU' processors made by AMD, which combines both the CPU and GPU on the same chip - allowing you to use solid integrated graphics while not sacrificing too much on either end and saving some money in your wallet.<br /><br />This processor can play almost all games at low/medium settings at 1080p with really no problems, and it the processor can handle almost all general computer tasks. Video playback at 1080p is great too with no lag, I use an HDMI cable to watch movies on my TV as well.<br /><br />If you can get some RAM that is clocked at 1866 instead of the standard 1600, that really helps with the APU (while it usually has no real noticeable effects, it DOES with an APU) and you can see 5-10% gains in gaming.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A must have for my collection.  I will watch over and over again.  I like all the extras on the discs.
B004M8S6FC|3.0|Scalzi has invented a rich universe, a future for the human race that is both compelling and plausible.  I want to know about this world, about the people who live in it and how it functions.<br /><br />However, Scalzi's main character is 2-dimensional, a  paragon whose only flaw is being too nice - even his drill-sergeant can't find anything disagreeable about him.  There are no problems that this character faces that seem like a threat, no problems that seem insurmountable and even when the character is mortally wounded, we don't feel like his life is genuinely in danger.<br /><br />Scalzi writes action very well, and I raced through the book.  If you're looking for a romp-in-space with some cool space battles and fun tech thrown in, then this is for you.  If you're looking for something more contemplative, then you might want to give this a miss.
B005YVTHT0|5.0|It' s a five star rating on this particular product .  Like driving a real steering wheel in a real racing car.
B00170I7GG|4.0|Gotta love Bill Murray in this classic. Funny and original. Worth watching especially if you've never seen it. I recommend.
B0091WUZJE|5.0|Perhaps John Wayne's finest work in my opinions and shows that even the coldest heart can change with time.  This work is also one of the best Western Movies of all time.
B00012QM86|5.0|The year is 1939 and the United States has yet to enter World War II.  Oskar Schindler, a German war profiteer arrives on scene in Germany hoping to make a small fortune .  Working with the SS military officials, Schindler is running a factory building mess kits. When he first opens the factory, he enjoys considerable profits as he hires Jewish Poles instead of Catholics because they were cheaper labor, and what began as a for profit operation begins to be more about keeping as many Jews out of the concentration camps as possible.  Throughout the movie, Schindler and his collaborator Itzhak Stern focus on bribing Nazi officials to keep support at high levels while keeping as many Jews from going to concentration camps. As Schindler gets ready to leave Krakow with his substantial profits, he feels great guilt and sorrow and persuades Goeth to let him take all of his workers to a factory in his old home away from death in the camps. The bribes are extremely high however, his list takes many workers with him, saving them from death. As the war comes to an end, Russian Troops draw nearer and Schindler must flee because he is considered a Nazi Party member. At this point he is given a ring that has Talmudic words to hopefully save his life. In the end, Schindler is out of money and has risked his life to save as many Jews as possible.<br /><br />  Overall, this movie is a sad story of human nature and the way history repeats itself.  When tyrannical government takes over nations, it causes ordinary individuals to do horrible things they would not ordinarily do. The actors in this film perform civic duty to inform the world of the horror that took place in Nazi Germany during World War II. The cast members and supporting cast did an excellent job portraying the real life people who were saved by Schindler and Stern. World Religions were shaken by this event as more innocent people were killed due to ethnicity and religious affiliation than any other single event in the 20th century. This event therefore put other religious groups on alert; this could happen to them! This film depicts events of the Holocaust that vastly shaped Judaism and created ultimate sympathy for a group of people once oppressed for centuries.  One would think that after such a horrible event the world would never accept such ethnic cleansing as happened during this time period, yet ethnic cleansing continues in Africa more regularly than any news organization would like to admit. Nevertheless, Schindler's list is the canary in the coal mine that will forever immortalize the millions of innocent lives lost and forever serve as a warning of such a horrific tragedy to never happen again. Hitler, and the holocaust are the keynote warning signs to any religious nation now and in the future, let this never, ever happen again.
B000FA675C|1.0|You should stay away from this book.  Like a kid should stay away from a cliff.  Like a clean person should stay away from a septic tank.  Like a little girl should stay out of sex chat rooms.  You should stay away from this book.  Consider yourself warned.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|what a dreadful movie. What was Denzil Washington thinking about when he agreed to do this lemon.The first half hour about a plane crash is OK then it dissolves into a dreary molodrama ambout the pilot who is an alcoholic and ddrug user. What a dreary film I hate films about people who have no will power....alcoholics and drug users. What a total waste of money.......Denzil Washington has just lost a lot a brownie points.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season at the prison with some of the things that have happened has been some of the best TV I've ever seen. Great season!! As good as season 1.
B00BRR66SA|1.0|The title says it all, his pop songs were better listening than this....and speaking of \\"this\\"...what the HECK is it!??!?<br /><br />Disappointment doesn't begin to describe what I felt when listening to these samples...don't know who is writing his music, but they should go to barber school instead.<br /><br />EDIT: Ok got a comment and went back to listen yet again....I get that this type of music isn't for everyone, but I don't see any...hard to get in text...I guess you'd say 'heart' in his songs.<br />I don't know how else to put it, but that being said it looks as though some people enjoy it...so more power to you.<br /><br />I enjoy a lot of different types of songs, but it depends on the song itself, it has to have something to draw me to it...these just don't. Which is sad, because I like him in his movies & I liked SOME of his boy group days songs. Oh well maybe next CD....
0552769762|5.0|Great to send as a gift as a gift for a 'reader' who, incredibly, had not read Dan Brown - got rave reviews :)
B004HYXW1O|4.0|Pretty decent album overall. I really enjoy listening to the song &#34;Science & Faith,&#34; although I disagree with the false dichotomy it describes; there is love in science too!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Be careful this show is addictive!  My entire family loves it!  The cast, the characters, the storyline are all so refreshing.  So different from anything else currently on TV.  I can't wait for the next episode!
B005IQZB14|5.0|A great read, well written and being a true story makes it even better.  It made me want to walk the Pacific Crest Trail!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Ethereal was the word that came to mind while watching this movie - the 'finale' is entirely up to the viewer
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Decent band with an awesome name. I bought it for Radioactive, It's Time, and Demons, but I like all of the songs.
B00136Q342|5.0|I wish somebody (Amazon?) would market all of the 58 &#34;Johnny Cash Show&#34; TV show segments. I'm a railroad fan and I always enjoyed his &#34;Ride This Train&#34; songs. A whole new generation could learn of him. His music is timeless. He wasn't pefect, but who of us is?
0385536828|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised.  It took me a couple of pages to get in to it, but after that I couldn't put it down.  This is not the type of book I usually read but I thoroughly enjoyed it!
B007REV4T8|5.0|Well done and great fun - particularly as the 'regulars' like Q have suddenly regained their youth :) Recommend for any age :)
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I am very biased because I really like the new superhero movies; but this is definitely one of my favorites. The cast is great, the mix of humor and drama is well-balanced. I really liked this movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Saw season 3 first, then season 1, so we HAD to get to see season 2 to fill in the blanks.<br />Very addicting show.  Great costumes and scenery.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Cinematography alone makes the movie worthwhile.  It is realistic and looks amazing in HD.  Interesting storyline, but well done overall.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|This was bought for my son and he absolutely loves it. He has it playing all the time and watches it over and over.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|i really like this series...there is a lot of action,and a lot of feeling...so if you are looking for these kinds of  things in  what you watch, then you will really like this series...
B003JTHXOK|3.0|The book Safe Haven has some interest, however, after reading I felt it a lesser variation of Sleeping With The Enemy.
B00B01XDTI|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Silent Hill games; I have played them all. You would have to have played a lot of them (or at least played SH 3) to &#34;get&#34; some of the references in the movie. I liked it because it was like playing one of the games. The acting was at times cheesy but the graphics were good. If you don't like playing the games then don't watch this movie.
B00BESKTMG|2.0|Poor character development, plot was simplistic, scenes with the chinese brothel seemed unnecessary and didn't contribute to the plot. was disappointed
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Friends insisted we watch Downton Abbey.  Can't explain it! You just want to keep coming back... you are one of the family!
B008HK3XOU|4.0|I choose &#34;I like it&#34; over I love it only because my son got a case for his that I really like much better than mine! I do like my case, it works great and I love the color. I like the case because it keeps my Kindle protected when I have to store it in my bag or backpack. It fits perfectly and it is just an all round great case. I would recommend this product to anyone who like myself takes their Kindle EVERY WHERE with them! It really protects my kindle from bumps and bangs!
B002BBJ52U|1.0|the antithesis of what it claimed to be.  not funny, no lesson learned.  spent 1 hr 30 setting up what it ultimately completely destroyed.<br /><br />I am not a romantic comedy buff, but I do like my movies to at least follow a theme through to the end.  this one negated itself and made me feel like I wasted a whopping 2 HOURS and change. AND it wasn't even a little bit funny.  Didn't enjoy the ride, hated where it took me.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Enjoyed this historically based film. Great job by Affleck directing and acting! If you like this you should also watch Seal Team Six: The Raid on Osama Bin Laden
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book was just super. There were plenty of funny moments in the book that just had me bursting out with laughter. For only $.99, it's well worth it.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The box with the disks was even wonderful.  The disks were flawless and watching on blu-ray is the best.  Great product
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great! i loved it alot very good yay yay yay ayayyayyayayyaya hshshhs  b b h h h h j j j j j j j j j j j j j
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Another great book by Colleen Hoover.  The beginning of the book is so different than the end you will think you are reading two different books. I highly recommend this book.  A great read!
B0053JJLLC|4.0|MC is always great, this one is particularly cool because he puts you in another world, but it's real. Makes you think...
B002N7CTKM|4.0|I started watching this when a few friends had told me about it. Overall, I like the gist and the characters are pretty good. Their chemistry and interactions are well drawn out, and each has their little quirks. A friend of mine advised that it really starts to get much better about midway through season 1, as that is where they really start taking chances and getting their stride. I would agree with this assertion, and I would say ' you'll know when you hit that point'. I'm looking forward to checking out the next couple seasons, as I hear they continue on the same path up through season 4.
0446572993|5.0|This book was given as a gift because David Balducci is her favorite author. She told me tha she loved the book.
B007V5CF5K|3.0|This is amusing and easy but also frustrating. Periodically, the game fizzles out and dumps you back at the start screen. The only good thing is that it goes back to where you were right before you completed whatever action it fizzles out on.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Really fun. I get addicted to it. Very creative. I definitely recommend this game. I have a lit of fun with it. It's a little confusing at first but you get the hang if it.
B004K8WPUQ|4.0|I have been using this mic since around November to do video work. The mic does pretty well at picking up the sound I'm looking to try and get. I've primarily been using it with the low pass turned on to take away background buzz, and that seems to work fairly well. I have primarily been going into the camera and then working with the audio tracks from there, so I can't speak to how well it would work with something like the Zoom series of recorders, however I am fairly confident that it would provide an excellent signal to noise ratio.<br /><br />It comes with extra rubber bands for the shock system and a ten year warranty (if you purchase from an authorized retailed - Amazon.com is one) that's a pretty nice deal.<br /><br />One thing to be careful about is the battery placement and how the battery compartment door closes. It can be a bit tricky and might take a little fiddling with to get it to work. only other complaint is the thickness on the cord of the mic, its pretty thin so if you catch it on something, there's a good chance you could end up damaging it.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|There is a reason this series has been so overwhelmingly popular -- the writing is awesome and the story is captivating. Only concern I would have is for readers being influenced by the idea of witchcraft. As a follower of the bible I will definitely talk with my children about this element while they are reading. But I will use it as a teaching point.
B00957T6X6|5.0|The HBO season 1 follows the book very weel.<br />Season two goes in to book three a little.  But very glose.<br />Very good read.  Really like the characters.<br />Lord of the Rings in a different setting and theme.<br /><br />Really enjoy my read time with this.
1451695195|5.0|I am still reading this book and its by choice. I should be finished but I really dont want it to end. I'm savoring ecery chapter and allowing it all to sink deep within. This is an amazing read so far, I'm in chapter 10. Buy it.. get it on your Kindle.. do whatever but if you think  there is a Heaven this will change your mind and if you don't believe there is a Heaven this book will change your mind. There is no way anyone can describe what this man has and not been there,,,Heaven is REAL people. Thats all i have to say!!!!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I appreciate all the extras that came with the box set, but I was disappointed with the instructions to access all those extras.
B00280LYIC|4.0|watched the movie, then read the book and really liked it so i wanted to own it.  Love having access to it on my kindle. recommend it to anyone
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read this book three or four times.<br />Will read it again.<br />The trilogy is great.<br />Don't start until you are ready to read all three books.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|This show is my guilty pleasure.  I really enjoy Arrow and would recommend it to anyone who has even a passing interest in superhero and action/dramas.
B008BDZOZY|3.0|I had high hopes for this CD, being a longtime fan of David Byrne's solo work and the classic albums he made with Talking Heads. I had only heard a single song by St. Vincent previously, but her voice intrigued me, all the more reason to get excited about this pairing. And yet, after nearly 20 listens, I'm still waiting to be impressed by these songs, but with the exception of \\"The One Who Broke Your Heart\\" (a fun song that features the Dap Kings) it isn't happening. You can call this music quirky or even challenging, but it falls far short of greatness. Interesting arrangements (I like the use of horns) and if you enjoy the vocals by either singer, that's a plus too. But I find the songs lacking in memorablility overall. They chug and sputter and don't really go anywhere. I think these two tried hard and strived for good performances, but the mediocre quality of these compositions prevented the album from taking flight.
B005OJTVMK|5.0|I bought this case right after purchasing my kindle so I would have something to protect it.  It has been a perfect thing to protect the screen.  I would recommend this to anyone who owns a kindle
B001GF8WPI|5.0|This is the only movie I have ever liked him (Will Ferrell) - He can be a good actor when he want's to be.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|People may call the show dark, and it is, but at the same time it presents a fairly realistic picture of all the palm greasing and backroom deals that go into making up so much of our national policies - policies created by our congress, sponsored by corporations or small private interests that DON'T represent public interest or the interests of other denizens of the country.  Take for example the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) policy of removing wild horses from our public lands.  After being rounded up by the thousands with helicopters over the last 4 years, there are 50,000 wild horses now being held in warehouses, paid for with the tax dollar, thanks to the BLM's firm cooperation with ranchers and the livestock industry who view wild horses as \\"competition for cheap tax-payer subsidized livestock grazing on public lands.\\"  It's a costly tragedy paid for by tax-payers that has NO PUBLIC SUPPORT - -  but then, as House of Cards so amply demonstrates, it's not REALLY about what the public wants - it's about what INDUSTRY wants.  And industry finances the politicians, who make the laws -  ultimately spending our hard-earned tax dollars on programs - such as the current livestock industry/BLM war on America's wild horses.  In a word it's corruption.<br /><br />And while this is certainly only a show, a fictional creation of the writers, it's archetypical in its scope and \\"human-ness\\".  Nice to see these issues getting a light shined on them in a setting we're familiar with.  It's \\"Rome\\" or \\"Game of Throne\\" set in Washington DC.  So they've brought it on home to us and I appreciate that.<br /><br />By the time the 2nd episode started I was more or less hooked.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|Found this game to have great graphics and just enough variety to keep me entertained for short bursts of time wasting. Best part of all, no in game purchasing. A horrible new trend in the android gaming scene...
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|read the first two and then decided that I couldn't wait for my friend to buy the book so i could read it so I just bought it on my kindle! would recommend this book
B000FBJAOG|5.0|Very entertaining book.  Max makes a lot of good points in here that even though it's all fantasy and make believe, they still make sense after you read it and think about it.  You say &#34;well I guess that would make sense if I was fighting a horde of zombies&#34;
B0033TJATW|5.0|Great movie! Any Michael Jackson fan would love it. My husband and my son love to watch this movie together!
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|As video gamers, my bf and I really wanted to watch this movie when we saw the previews, and I have to say that surprisingly he found it way more amusing than I did. (That's not to say I didn't love it either)<br /><br />It is a really great movie, and if you understand video games some of the things they do and say is extremely funny.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I truely liked this movie i rented it because of all the preview on tv made me interested in seeing what the movie was truely about.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|This book series is great and Joe Abercrombie is a fantastic author.  I really enjoyed this read as long as all his other books.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love this game! It is pretty to look at. They sound like gems when they fall. Different board patterns as you go. Super fun!
B0090P98Z4|4.0|I like it so far its a convenient game I like to play tthese kind of games I recommend it
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Absolutly loved this movie.  The play back was great and i would definatly recommend renting this movie to any of my friends
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book series is great and GRRM is a fantastic author.  I really enjoyed this read as long as all his other books.  I just hope that the next book doesn't take 5 years to come out.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|It's hard to put this book down once started but it is meant to read slowly and savor the journey!  It can certainly put you back on track with your dreams if you have strayed! Definitely read!
B007MCTTHY|3.0|The idea behind this game is simple enough, move the pipes to get the formula to it's final location.  There are one or two levels early on that are rather challenging, and seem unsolvable, but they are.  Once past those levels, the game starts feeling repetitive.  For those who have gotten stuck, think symmetry - most of the solutions are symmetric.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|Loved reading the book and instantly wanted to own it.  Purchased on kindle so that i could have access to it anywhere anytime
B009I2UH2W|5.0|works great.  The coiled cord is a little too tightly coiled for my taste but that's personal preference.  Don't mind the gremlins yelling about a bright light.  it's fine.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|My Dad was laid off from the FAA (Thanks Obama) and we used to watch this show. A case a beer and this totally lit up his face.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|i admit it...i'm hooked. Great story lines, wonderful characters, beautiful scenery. Acting is fantastic. Just started watching, so I have a lot of catching up
B003Y5H5AG|1.0|purchased this video at the time the order was placed I had enough money, which was 235 and some change, now it seems like  will have to pay extra for something that was already paid for, and that is not fair when the money Was there, I asked for the order to be grouped in one order if possible, may be it's not a good ideal to order a large order which could end up costing more.
B007XIC1GI|1.0|I think this is a very raunchy book. I didn't even want to finish the book.<br />Not worth the money.
1558908323|3.0|This is a very grim movie.  It involves a group of individuals who try to destroy invading bugs under the tunnels in New York City.  I gave it a three star because the acting is good and the plot is suspensful...however, this is a very grim movie...nothing pleasant about it.  I would not watch it again...it's that grim!
B00B1OWEX0|5.0|This album is the ultimate in sound quality. Reznor fans should rejoice in the experimental nature of the music here. NOT for casual listening I will add though. It should be an EXPERIENCE, not just something you throw on to fold laundry.
B000NQRE9Q|2.0|The letterbox display of the movie only takes up half the vertical height of my screen.  There isn't even an option to zoom in.  I don't understand why movie studios can't manage to fill up the full screen in these Blu-Ray releases on HD when somehow HBO doesn't seem to have any problems filling up the full screen when you watch movies on cable/FiOS.<br /><br />Other than that the picture looks fine.
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|Outstanding, leaves you on the edge of your seat and creepy in a wild psychological way. I can't wait for the next sesson.
B00797MB0O|1.0|I kept watching, thinking...something is going to happen, a change of heart, a revelation an epiphany, maybe a totally unexpected twist...anything to make this uncomfortable, miserable, dark and hopeless movie redeem itself. Sadly, it was just a horrible movie.
B005MXQD5Q|5.0|The best music I have ever owned. What a wonder and how thrilling it is to see and hear him and his musicians performing.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|This movie is really good. I had no desire to see it but was pleasantly surprised by it. I highly recommend it.
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|This was very good movie a bit odd but overall entertaining as you do not expect what is happening. Recommend as a good watch.
4898153194|5.0|The photographs of this solitary woman and her cat are both timeless and universal. There is great love in every image: of the photographer for her elderly grandmother, of cats and nature, the change of seasons, and a simple life lived in a balance of work, companionship, and beauty.
1616550414|5.0|great buy and a must have for any zelda fan. has a history of zelda and a timeline for the series
B007GE2H3G|5.0|I haven't watched tin tin since my elementary school days. But this movie was able to capture the essence of this classic cartoon the story wasn't a novelty but was well told and very captivating.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Took a little while to get going, but once it did...wow! Kept us on the edge of our seats for most of the movie.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|After seeing the  current movie version, I now want to read it for more of the historical events that occurred.t
B009FZHYKU|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!! Wish it was on everyday! Can't get enough of it. Our children are even hooked!! Everyone should watch it!!
B008Y73940|4.0|Held my attention and the acting was terrific. Many twists and turns to keep you on edge. Worth watching for the second time.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|Makes you think and each level gets a little more difficult to solve. It would be nice if the levels continued but maybe need so hints if one were to get stuck on a level.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Nice app but freezes almost every single time i have it open. Extremely frustrating. May delete it solely for that reason.
B0000AUHPB|5.0|This was one of Michael's best. It also showed the greatness and uniquement of the original Mini. The original Mini was built to provide a second car for the housewife but its drivability made it the love of sports car enthuisiasts. I owned one of the very first ones with the rubber cone suspension.
B0024FAR5W|5.0|I saw the series and thought &#34;i must have it to my collection&#34; these are 3 disc with the full first season in a great quality
B00846WWVM|2.0|I think this is more suited for younger people. Could be a good game for that generation. Not for me.
B006FLGBGA|5.0|Caesar should get an oscar!<br /><br />Seriously though, the movie was way better than I expected. I would have liked more insight into the human's lives, especially Caesar's bond with the main character's father, but it was still excellent nonetheless. Cant wait for the sequel!
1616550414|5.0|Fantastic book! The artwork is extremely cool and the information is great. The build quality is great and I plan on using this as a &#34;coffee table&#34; like book for years to come!
B0050PYNP8|5.0|This movie makes you wonder, if there are aliens, &#34;where is everybody&#34;????<br /><br />Our family was watching Top Gear interview the two cast members, and we decided to take a chance and order the movie.  Best decision ever made.  We keep it in the DVD player all the time. I would love to describe the scenes in this movie but I don't want to spoil it.<br /><br />One note though, this movie has ADULT Language in it all over the place, so watch it yourself before letting any children watch it.  It is not for the faint of heart language wise.<br /><br />Other than that, this movie will make you want to rent an RV and head west to see area 51 and hope that you run into &#34;Paul&#34;.
B00AK0X5VQ|3.0|Played this for a while, but got bored with it. Needs new objectives or something to change it up to keep ones attention.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I love Denzel Washington..I surely do!  What a great all around actor this man is.  He can play any role he wants and do it well. I also liked it because of the story line.  Even under the influence, this pilot performed a super &#34;landing&#34; of the aircraft.
B005R4HUZM|5.0|When I first read Le Rouge Et Le Noir as a teenager, inspired by the movie starring G&eacute;rard Philippe, I thought it wasn't that great, a bit boring actually. But, over the last 50 years, the book has matured and acquired life experience and, to my delight, has turned into a marvelous character and sociological study. Read it!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Watched with my wife over the weekend. Looking forward to seeing it with kids one day. Fun for all ages. Great voice acting by known stars.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|This is excellent. I haven't used it a lot yet, but from what I see it does everything and then some.
B009RRIP86|5.0|This hybrid case/test bench is just what I was looking for. The looks and cable management of a high end case. With the ease of access that only a lab bench could afford. I can make hardware adjustments on the fly very easily. The hot swappable drive bays are also very convenient. Cooling options are plentiful. Whether you're liquid cooling like me or using air. You'll be happy. Then this thing is just so hardcore looking! lol I'm very proud as well as pleased to own one. Highly recommended.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Great rendition of the book! I'd recommend reading it before searching the movie our you might miss some of the key elements.
0345803507|5.0|I bought this for my mother and she absolutely enjoyed it.  Great condition.  Arrived on time.  A perfect buy and well worth the price and then some.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Hilarious! I love this show. It is my favorite show on TV. It's very well written and the cast does a great job. Jim Parsons is perfect. Bazinga!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|These books are of course building upon each other, so recommend to<br />read them in order.  There is a new surprise in each one.  Nothing realistic<br />but very entertaining.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Very easy to use and navigate; many of my friends are already on Pinterest; it's fun and easy to follow!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is such a amazing book with great chapter a must read you will love it you will not regret reading it
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great series! Will always be one of my favorites!<br />Makes me remember why I love to read in the first place!
0061743526|5.0|I first read To Kill A Mockingbird when I was in Junior High School.  And I have probably read it 30 times since.  It is still relevant today.
B00013RC8O|5.0|I got this for my husband who hasnt seen it for years, He just bought a Dodge Challenger and I guess it brought back memories of the original one.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Our second favorite.  Darker than P and P BBC.  Many people die but in the end they fall in love.
B0031KE9C6|5.0|Watching Veronica Mars for the 5th time and it still makes me happy!  Everything about the show just works.  Highly recommend watching.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Fun app but can get a little laggy at times. Touching certain items doesn't always register them. Overall it is a good time killer.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|My family really like this movie.  The graphics on HD was wonderful and the story line was interesting.  Its a good one to watch.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a must have. It is so easy to use, you have a choice of version. So many things you can do with this bible. I would recommend to everyone..
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I am not a mathematician, so I do not need a calculator with all the bells and whistles, and this app fits my needs perfectly (and since I am on my Kindle all the time anyway, it makes it quite convenient!). Easy to use and understand (I especially like the large buttons). I would recommend this app to anyone!
0061689246|2.0|Neil Gaiman has done better. This writing is almost old english, so I would reccomend this book for young adults and older.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|My family loved this movie.  It's cute for all ages and the graphics as HD was grogeous! You have to see it to believe me.
B0074VA2T2|5.0|This game is great for a younger child. The instructions ask the child to click a number of fruit and after you click the fruits the child then needs to press done. My 2 and a half yr old is able to play level one on his own. He even started to repeat the numbers after. So this app does its job. As another reviewer stated I really wish there were some good job screens after correct answers. I do like that the app is very simple as far as graphics go just as the books are. However I do not think the all ages label is appropriate for this as I think it's only the toddlers and young preschoolers who will really enjoy it. I was able to get this app as a FAOTD  I think the normal price tag is a bit steep at $2.99 but it is worth a try like I said the app does do its job
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is fun to play, you have plenty of chance to get more money, acorns and a 'll you need and you learn about animals. I can't stop playing, it is easy to get addicted to it, just a fair warning. Enjoy!!!!
B0074VA2T2|4.0|This game has several features to delight your child.<br /><br />1. The pictures of food are very easily recognizable items from everyday life.<br />2. The five levels require different skills and abilities.  Children will be able to play at their current skill and ability level.<br />3. The music is very nice.  It's upbeat and catchy without taking on a \\"sing-song\\" type of sound.<br />4. The narrator speaks clearly and soothingly, congratulating correct choices and gently encouraging children when they are wrong.<br />5.  Feedback is immediate.<br />6.  The sounds can be turned on or off.  This gives the game a different feel.<br />7.  Children will not only learn how to count; they will also be able to learn to identify specific food items.<br />8.  The caterpillar character is very cute.  It helps teach the concepts.<br />9.  There is a good pyramid containing fruits, which will encourage healthy eating habits.<br />10.  The narration is also written out, so children will have the opportunity to learn some reading skills.<br />11.  The animations were entertaining.  Fruit on the pyramid, for example, spins around in circles.<br />12.  The colors are very nice and vibrant.  They \\"pop\\" off the screen, and will help to keep the attention of young children.<br /><br />Could Be Improved<br /><br />1. I'm not sure why the computer prompts you to \\"eat\\" the food items.  It seems you should be instructed to \\"touch\\" the food items instead.<br />2. The fifth level, when you're racing against the clock, is very challenging.  The response time for the prompts and responses is too slow for a speed game, eating up time from the clock while you wait for the computer to catch up with you.  Even as an adult, I had trouble beating the clock.  But I'll keep trying! ;)  I'm afraid small children would be frustrated by the game.  By adding a few levels (novice, intermediate and expert), and allowing children to choose a level that matches their skills, the children would not become frustrated.<br /><br />P.S. I own a Kindle Fire.ustrated.<br /><br />P.S. I own a Kindle Fire.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|TV at its very best.  Not for the faint of heart.  If you are tired of watching the drivel they put on the air,  give this a chance.  Some surprising situations, some venal characters and some almost lovable ones.  A true masterpiece.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|The story line of this movie was really good. The graphics were awesome and it thought children what friendship means and how caring people can be
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Game is fun to play, but the energy is slow loading. It would be nice to be able to get it faster, without spending dollars for it.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|If you are a fan of Middle-Earth, then you should be reading this series. The world of Westeros and the surrounding lands and people within are as intriguing as any you will find. I had read the first book many years ago but then when the HBO series came out, I was compelled to read it again. I found this deal on Amazon and went ahead and picked up all 4 books in a bundle. It's heavy reading and the story does drag a bit in places, but overall I would highly recommend these books to anyone who is a fan of detailed fantasy.
0307341577|4.0|Gillian Flynn's character's are strange, violent folk. She may look like the Girl-Next-Door, but she writes about some pretty dark families in her neighborhood...or yours!<br /><br />Entertaining, twisted, and gory, too. A fun read when you're nursing a broken knee! But this book and &#34;Sharp Objects&#34; seemed to need some major editing.<br /><br />&#34;Gone Girl's&#34; her third novel and the best so far, has a perfectly wrought plot, evil characters and seems properly edited.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Powerful and classic. A great masterpiece of it's time period. The wonderful wizard of oz is a must read for all ages.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I haven't been able to stop thinking about this book since I read it.  It is totally different than anything I have ever read about child offenders.  You will not be disappointed if you want a well written, mind bending, thriller based on an upper middle class family.  The characters are strong and the writer does a superb job of pulling you in.  I couldn't put it down.  It's that good.  It is a book you will recall over and over and probably, like me, go back and re-read parts of.  Great look at a mystery that has been with us since Cain and Abel.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I am a huge Walking Dead fan so this was of course a must have. I'll be buying season 2 soon. Don't have to depend on Netflix to have the show available when you have a copy!<br />Wish they would release seasons earlier!
0307341550|4.0|Gillian Flynn's character's are strange, violent folk with complicated personalities. Flynn may look like the Girl-Next-Door, but she writes about some pretty dark families in her neighborhood...or yours!<br /><br />Entertaining, twisted, and gory, too. A fun read if you're nursing a broken knee or the flu! But this book and &#34;Dark Places&#34; seemed to need some major editing.<br /><br />&#34;Gone Girl's&#34; her third novel and the best so far, has a perfectly wrought plot, evil characters and seems properly edited.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book is wonderfully written.  The story and characters are fully developed, it is easy and amazing to just get lost in Katniss' saga.  I was unsure about this series because I steer clear of teen romances - I could not have guessed I would enjoy it so much.
B000JMKNVK|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed each of these books by Dennis Lehane.  I am a criminal/serial killer type reader.  The characters in these books draw you in.  They are totally believable people and you will be turning pages well into the night.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I found it to a be a slow moving and kind of choppy story line.  The acting was also fairly weak.  Not my favorite Bond movie.
0385344228|3.0|The plot of &#34;Defending Jacob&#34; is an interesting one, but there is something off in the telling, perhaps the POV, a father who is a  an unreliable narrator, who the reader can't trust. While  the story is compelling and ultimately disturbing, the writing isn't top notch.
B00AOOIIVA|5.0|I was afraid it would be too scary for him, but he loved it!  My young daughters not so much.  It was very clever with a great storyline - just a bit &#34;dark&#34; in spots.  And a tear-jerker at the end - my wife had to leave the room because she was crying so much.<br /><br />On another note, it is very interesting to try to explain to a 6-year old why the movie is not in color - they have no concept of time before DVR's, Netflix, and endless on-demand movies & TV shows.  Much less the concept that movies were not all in color!
B000JMKNV0|4.0|What can I say?  I love this writer and I love his books.  The characters are well developed and strong and he keeps me turning pages.  Only thing is, I hate to finish his books because then I have nothing good to read until I find another good author.
B000F8O35U|4.0|it took no time to get the movie the case and one of the movies were in excellent condition but the other disc had like a heat spot crack at the center but other than that it was fine

B005RUUUAI|5.0|high quality viewing and best written TV series i've seen with top notch actors putting it all in. Addictive is a common word surrounding this show.
B00385TM3K|2.0|Great movie that I could no see it , because of the slowness of the program with amazon<br />Need to improve the speed of the downloading
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very cute game. You can cheat by buying gems which I did or you can go along in the game
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I first watched this series when it debuted on cable television's HBO channel, and I was so impressed with it, that I just HAD to purchase a copy for my own library.<br /><br />Not only that, but I even bought one as a gift for a friend who teaches Constitutional Law at Brigham Young University.<br /><br />The series is clean enough for the entire family to watch together, and it is highly instructive in accurately depicting living conditions during the American Revolutionary War of Independence.<br /><br />You'll find this movie to be very inspiring, and I highly recommend it as a teaching tool for high school and college students.

B00005JLIU|5.0|This is a fun musical comedy, filled with wishful romance and surprising twists throughout the show!<br /><br />I very HIGHLY recommend it, especially for a young couple to enjoy together for an intimately romantic evening.<br /><br />Also, the movie is clean enough for the entire family to enjoy watching together.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I'm not sure we can survive without our Homeland fix.  When will season two be available?  Every time we think we have this figured out, there is a brilliant new twist.
0425264351|2.0|Read this on a recommendation. What a bad book. Why books like this that contain nothing...NOTHING of value or interest become such big sellers I will never know. My guess is that the vast majority of people can barely read of have such low comprehension levels that they feel like they have accomplished something when finished. Travis McGee novels are way better. Elmore Leonard appears a genius compared to this author. Don't take my word for it...read this crap for yourself. Lee is gonna sell a bazillion of these things....a MacDonalds burger at best

030758836X|5.0|This was a page turner for me.  I had never read one of Gillian Flynn's books before, but I really liked the style or her writing.  This book is unusual in that the story is told from the perspective of both characters (and not exactly in a linear fashion), but it was still easy to follow.  The descriptions of the characters in the book were so spot on that I could think of people in my own life that were basically mirror images.  The story was your typical &#34;love gone wrong&#34;, however, the pages take you to places that the reader does not expect.  I must admit that I couldn't foresee the plot twists in this book and I love when that happens.  I read the book in a matter of days.  I stayed up much too late as I found that I didn't want to put it down.  I recently bought another book by the same author, but haven't started it yet.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Hard to get into in the beginning but very thought provoking, the power of perception will take you on quite a journey in this book, strange and somewhat sad ending in my opinion, made me second guess the entire story I just read
B005LAIIGC|5.0|My kids LOVE this movie (7 and 11).  Fun for adults too.  The hoppying eggs are a great add on and very fun.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Thought provoking. Spiritually challenging and stimulating for this old science-bound MD. THANK YOU !<br />Incidentally, I knew your Dad, and we each served on the NC Medical Board, all be it at different times. Dave Kelly is my somewhat younger med school classmate.

B00A6PD9I4|4.0|A movie that is truly full of adventure. I enjoyed that the main character was a female and her struggles to become were highlighted. The main topic of true love and devotion was well played out in this drama.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I was glad to see the show and books don't mirror each other. It's almost like reading a whole different story.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book had a most interesting protagonist.  You could watch her grow into herself with the words of the author.  I loved all of the language of the flowers and integral they were to the story.  A beautiful story that is sometimes very painful to read.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Like many others, I have heard a lot about the book and decided to read it for myself. The story line is better than I anticipated and the sex scenes were integrated well into the story line. I am, however, disappointed at the ending but it most definitely leaves you wanting to read more.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Very scientific yet readable review of the data behind the low carb lifestyle.  A great read and a real eye opener.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I have REALLY enjoyed this CD.  The first time I saw the Lumineers and Mumford and Sons was on The Grammys and I immediately ordered CDs by both groups.  I find that I listen The Lumineers more than Mumford and Sons as the songs are more fun and not so dark sounding.  But, this young 70 year old is loving both groups!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Very touching and insightful book about the state of the foster care system in our country.  So many challenges for this young women who was so mismanaged from a very early age.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|For me this was a good book to read because although the writer comes from a different navy community than I did (he was a SEAL and I was a navy deep sea diver) our communities operated in similar fashion.  In fact the last ship I was on belonged to DEVGRU.  Too often books like this are filled with a lot of fluff, self glorification, and embellishment - I do not feel this was the case with this book.  Some of the writer's peers may feel differently.  In any case it is an interesting historical perspective by someone who was there from start to finish.  I thank the author for his service.
B000VAPZM2|3.0|The movie doesn't play in all DVD players. My daugher had to come and take my DVD player from my room because the movie would not play in her DVD player.

B008DKBPTO|5.0|I bought this sleeve because the other case I have for my Kindle Paper White kept turning it on when I shut the flap. I guess there was something wrong with the sleep/wake function; so I did not want another case like that. Anyway I love the Timbuk2 Ballistic Envelope Sleeve for Kindle with 360 degree protection. Not only is the case perfect for keeping your Kindle safe and secure, but the design (Lola Floral Mulberry) is beautiful too! The sleeve is nicely padded without being too bulky (in my opinion).The Kindle won't move a cm inside it. Also the (Velcro) flap stays pretty snugly in place. I don't think you can find a better case/sleeve for the price.
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|I was hoping that my using an app such as this it might make taking pictures a little easier. In my opinion, it doesn't help at all. I really don't think it makes it any easier. Never did understand why Kindle didn't put in a camera to be used no matter which way it faced.
B003IY49S4|4.0|Several of the discs in this collections are &#34;old friends&#34; from vinyl days. The music still is wonderful. Of interest is how short albums once were. This is a painless way to get some great perspective on jazz greats of the 20th century.
B008NMT684|5.0|my son loved it.  maybe a little to easy for a 3 year old but it did keep him entertained for quite a while
B00B0NDF26|4.0|This album has some absolute candy on it; &#34;Shock to Your System&#34; in particular is synthy and rad. The overall sound of the album is not hugely divergent from their previous work, but it is tighter and cleaner. It reflects the way they're maturing as artists and in their attention to production; the lyrics hint at maturity while reveling in the standard joys and turmoil that makes a heart throb.<br /><br />It's really the hook on &#34;Closer,&#34; their ode to preludes and anticipation, that really keeps you coming back for one more listen. To paraphrase, it's the spark before the start.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Have enjoyed the first series so far,  the characters are great and story lines have been consistent.  Walter and Olivia are my favourites,  the actors play their characters really well. Hope the show does not go too far off the reservation as it moves into season two and beyond with the alternate/ parallel universe.

B00BCZU8WM|4.0|It's a relatively short album so I've listened to it a few times through during the day and I'll say it's definitely an album you could leave on in the background and just let it play through (no bad tracks).  That being said, I agree with other reviewers who have stated that there aren't any real standouts either.  It's a Timbaland album for sure, and worth the $10.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Have used this quite a bit in the last 2 months and getting the hang of the cloud. Of those resources out there this has been the most true to the intent. I've had to download some music direct as it can skip from time to time when in a building, but generally works the best.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|to play this game.  As with any game the more you play it, the more you play it.  This could be a problem if you are employed.  It also could be a problem if you have high blood pressure as you sometimes reach a point in which the line at the bottom of the screen starts flashing and you are not finished.  But the purpose of the game is to have fun, RIGHT?  So use it and have fun.

B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I couldn't wait until season three was available for free, so I purchased the entire season in HD. It was cheaper than buying it one at a time. The first episode is good. I watched it twice. The writing is so clever and funny.<br /><br />On occasion, I have problems accessing my Amazon account from my TV. It just crashes and once, just stopped in the middle of watching a show. And the playback functionality goes too fast, it's a pain in the butt to rewind.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|This review is a copy of the one I posted on the \\"Radio Creme Brulee\\" blog that I write for. I figured I should mention this before I dive into the actual review. Now, that I've said that, here goes:<br /><br />In the age of ephemeral memory and fleeting loyalty to music artists, six years is a long gap between albums.It is hard to imagine that Justin Timberlake's last album \\"Future Sex Love Sounds\\" was released around six years ago.  For most artists, that gap spells career demise. Timberlake tided this gap by playing prominent roles in movies, Saturday Night Live episodes, and featuring on several artist's singles in the interceding years. This practically guaranteed that he did not become a victim to the \\"out of sight, out of mind\\" phenomenon. Other pop stars that want to take a long musical hiatus might want to take some pointers from Timberlake. Needless to say, despite the gap, the anticipation for the new album \\"20/20 Experience\\" has been high to say the least.<br /><br />One listen of the album would definitely convey the sense that Justin Timberlake has reached a point in his career where he feels he does not have to prove himself or actively compensate for his absence as a solo performer from the music business. The first sign of this level of comfort stems from his decision to stretch (as opposed to deviate from) the confines of the standard pop music template by making the songs on most of the album significantly longer than they need to be thus diluting their substantial core more than a little. The second sign is an obvious commitment to making a cohesive album as opposed to a disparate collection of \\"potential singles\\" loosely strung together. The album is created for listening in an intimate venue as opposed to a large arena or stadium. This is a rather surprising artistic move for an artist whose musical beginnings catered to a fanbase that was not associated with the \\"consumption\\" of full-length albums. Could it be a sign of artist maturation? Perhaps.<br /><br />There are some dominant musical elements that permeate through the entire length of the largely mid-tempo album. Most notably the harmony-driven choruses, string arrangements, Timberlake's falsetto, and an air of sophistication. Timbaland's progression as a producer is worth mentioning. He proves that he might be more than a knob-turner that brings more to the table than his \\"trademark beats\\" and annoying \\"Ay Ay\\" ad-libs. In fact, he just might have redeemed himself for his unbelievably poor production on Duran Duran's \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\" album.  His prowess is showcased best on the album's brilliant lead single \\"Suit And Tie\\". On this single, he layers modern beats over a \\"live band\\" feel (captured by the prominent horn sections). In fact, it is safe to say that \\"Suit and Tie\\" is hands down 2013′s first great pop single. The album's opener \\"Pusher Lover Girl\\" shows Timberlake making a foray into neo-soul territory musically. \\"Don't hold the wall\\" successfully marries mid-tempo R&B with eastern influences (most notably in the percussion elements). \\"Mirrors\\" is an ode to the sound that dominated the downtempo tracks on most of \\"Future Sex Love Sounds\\" (Timberlake's sophomore solo album). The song can be considered the musical twin of \\"What goes around comes around\\".<br /><br />Lyrically, Timberlake does not chart any new ground. His themes continue to be fairly lightweight (which is not necessarily a bad thing in pop music). The only downsides to this album are the length of many of the tracks and the fact that besides the two singles that have already been released (i.e. \\"Suit And Tie\\" and \\"Mirrors\\"), nothing else on the album screams \\"radio single\\". Those fans expecting a \\"dancey\\" pop album might also be disappointed. That being said, the album will definitely earn Timberlake respectability in the music business despite not explicitly catering to the commercial musical palate created by American terrestrial radio.<br /><br />Given that I have never taken a liking to Justin Timberlake's music, this album is definitely comes across as a pleasant surprise. It demonstrates artistic progression. It might not be a milestone for music but it sure has its share of promising moments. It definitely leaves the casual listener curious about what future musical offerings from Timberlake might sound like.ver taken a liking to Justin Timberlake's music, this album is definitely comes across as a pleasant surprise.

B009GX7IRA|5.0|I am enchanted with NCIS! A late arrival to the viewership, I have reviewed videos of all seasons recently and enjoyed them greatly. Most fascinating to me in the character development of the cast and the interweaving of sometimes violent action with engaging humor. It becomes obvious in Season 10 that the cast is becoming &#34;family.&#34; This is a fascinating development of cast and plot and action. Gibbs and Abbs hold it all together!
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Tommy Lee Jones is his usual prepared, talented self in this multiple murder mystery set in post-Katrina New Orleans.  His characterization of dedicated police officer Dave Robicheaux, putting together the pieces of the complicated puzzle which comprises a series of prostitute murders reaching far back into the seemingly unrelated fabric of New Orleans' complicated racist past, while confronting the personal demons recovering alcoholics must face, is believable, many-layered, and sensitive to both sides of the Deep South's troubled, segregationist history.  Credit must also be given to the director and editor for their handling of a series of hallucinatory encounters between Robicheaux and Confederate General John Bell Hood (Levon Helm) after the detective is given a drink laced with LSD.  These scenes could have easily tossed the film into the nether world of unbelievability, but cast and crew handle the difficult task of making these scenes ring true, bringing them surreally to life within the film's plot line and toward its dark conclusion.  Other cast standouts include veteran screen presence Mary Steenburgen--a welcome addition to any film--as his loyal and supportive wife, Peter Sarsgaard as the on-location film star dealing with his own &#34;battle of the bottle,&#34; Ned Beatty as influential businessman Twinky Le Moyne, who appears genuinely, though minimally, remorseful for his role in an ancient, apparently Klan-related murder, and especially long-time New Orleans resident John Goodman as the cynical, racketeer-with-a-punch-line, Julie &#34;Baby Feet&#34; Balboni, who as journeyman performer has become one of America's most impressive and reliable character actors.  Also watch for famed indie director John Sayles' portrayal of the--what else?--director of the partially mob-produced film around which the plot for IN THE ELECTRIC MIST is set.
0679735909|5.0|A beautifully written book with well drawn characters which translated into the wonderful film of the book. Have enjoyed this book the most of all I have read by her.

I am just so shocked that I paid real money for such horrible literature.  And so did other readers!!  Why am I not making a living by spewing out rambling incoherent nonsense and selling it on Amazon?!!  I lost IQ points reading this book.

0385349947|5.0|A couple of things to know about me before you read this review. I have been an advocate for gender equality and women's advancement in corporations for 40+ years and I am an expert on women and leadership. That said, I finished Lean In in a single sitting and loved it.<br /><br />Is it a guidebook for women in leadership? Not exactly. But that is not what Sheryl Sandberg set out to write. For me it is several important things and for any one of them should be read. In no particular order, Lean In is:<br /><br />  1. A summary for younger women of what has happened in the last 40 years to make possible today's opportunities for women.<br />  2. A compilation of important research upon which policy and practice choices should rest.<br />  3. A description of foundation skills that women (and men) need in order to be effective in business.<br />  4. A call for gender equality outside the workplace to enable gender equality inside the workplace.<br />  5. An unabashed feminist call for equality and a reminder of how far we have yet to go.<br />  6. An education for managers - men and women - about many of the biases that create career barriers for women.<br />  7. A source of helpful solutions for eliminating and minimizing some of these barriers.<br />  8. A collection of personal stories that women and men can relate to, modeling how to draw on their own experiences to make choices and to address gender dynamics.<br />  9. The voice of a new generation speaking to her peers who might not listen to those who blazed trails.<br />  10. A clarion call for women to make educated choices about their aspirations and not let unconscious biases or expectations (lowered) rule them.<br />  11. And is the all too rare and therefore courageous voice of a successful F500 woman executive pulling the curtain back once again,  shining light on issues of gender in the workplace and enabling a revitalized dialogue.<br /><br />I hope that every woman, man, manager and parent will read this book. While the advice to \\"lean in\\" alone won't get women to the top, it is an important part of the equation.<br /><br />Lead ON!<br />Susan Colantuono, CEO Leading Women

B008JFUN8C|5.0|This is the sort of movie that makes you start to consider buying a 3D television. The theatrical version was possibly the most breath taking event that I have had the pleasure to witness. The scenery alone makes this movie worth watching. And as for the movie...<br /><br />There is a non-stop homage to the original classic taking place here. It opens in black & white using only about 40% of the screen. And, like the classic, the screen morphs into color once Oz is reached. The manner in which it is done really pulls you in to the story. The Oz mythology gets a very respectful treatment and after seeing the movie, you will want to go watch The Wizard of Oz just to see all the connections.<br /><br />From the Wicked Witch and her \\"issues\\" with water (a whole new definition to \\"tracks of my tears\\" is created), to the Wizard's propensity to \\"award gifts\\" that are useless to any but the person on the receiving end...it is covered. my only gripe was that Mila Kunis did great, but once she transformed, she just looked like a bobble head on a Victoria's Secret mannequin.<br /><br />This is a movie that will not disappoint fans of the original...and that can be a tricky task.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|It was a very interesting book.  Jaycee lost her whole childhood, and the way she had to live was crazy.  The book shared the feelings she experienced throughout all of those years of being kidnapped, and it was interesting to see it through her eyes.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Where to start?  Literally thousands of reviewers have praised and lauded this book so I am not going to rehash the text.  Initially I almost put it on my `did not finish' list as I am not partial to the teenage angst genre.  Yes, it is my fault for not paying closer attention when I purchased the book.  It took me a long time to get into the storyline because of the writing style but I became accustomed to it and plowed on to the end.  The character development is beautiful; the romance is sweet and tender. It's gritty, emotional and gut wrenching but the pacing is so slow that I found myself getting antsy.  If I enjoyed the teenage angst format, I would be over the moon with this book.  Holden is every 18 year old's dream of a boyfriend - even with his justifiable moodiness.  Best friend Six is a hoot to read about.  But Sky steals the book with her thought process and emotional ride.  The author has exceptional talent in describing the human psyche.  Other than the following spoiler alert, I have only good things to say about the book.  However, the spoiler disclaimer is what prevents me from giving a five star rating.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert!* -- read at your own risk.<br /><br />This book needs a disclaimer in the front for those who are sensitive to or have been affected by child sexual abuse or incest.  The potential for flashbacks triggered by the story build up and revelations should be disclosed for the protection of victims.  Most should have no problem but there will always be a few who cannot handle the reminders or subject matter and they should be given fair warning. Triggering a flashback on an unsuspecting reader is irresponsible.

B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|David Bowie.  The Chameleon.  He has made a career out of reinventing himself and exploring new musical themes.  Now, after a 10 year self-imposed exile, David Bowie has turn himself into . . . himself.<br /><br />Throughout Bowie's career, fans would just get comfortable and settled in with his next musical style of choice before moving on to the next one.  On his latest album instead of plowing yet again into a new musical scene, Bowie seems to have lookiled back on all of them from his past and melded them together into something new.<br /><br />As you move through the songs on &#34;The Next Day&#34;,  you are constantly bombarded with bits and pieces that will immediately evoke memories of earlier albums.  From &#34;Golden Years&#34; to the Berlin trilogy to &#34;Outside&#34;, anyone who is familiar with his music will hear these homages to his past.  Even the cover artwork seems to make a distinct unavoidable note of his past, while making it clear he is moving forward at the same time. (The Berlin trilogy for those who are unaware are:  &#34;Low&#34;, &#34;Heroes&#34;, and &#34;Lodger&#34;)<br /><br />As for the album itself, I won't ruin the fun of identifying what sounds like what by writing them out, but the music clearly will peak the interest of Bowie fans and perhaps make a few new converts in the process.  Lyrically, the album seems like an endless rambling of Bowie-isms.  It's almost like the songs themselves run together and makes it hard to pick out the strong runners in the group.  The first single off the album, &#34;Where Are We Now?&#34; is CLEARLY the best song on the album.  It's also the one that is a complete departure from all the others.  For the rest of you, selecting what you feel are the best songs on the album would come down to what era of Bowie's past you like the most.  For me it's the Berlin trilogy sound.<br /><br />One final piece of advice: buy the deluxe verison.  I would submit that the bonus tracks are stronger than some of the album tracks.

B00BEPVAV8|3.0|I have only played this a couple times. I really don't enjoy this kind of game with the kind of controls I have on my Kindle Fire. It there was a steering wheel, pedals etc it might be more enjoyable. It really makes me kind of tense to play this, but I am not very good on racing type games to begin with. A true racing fan would probably find this very enjoyable to play. Just not my thing

B00BBIAB0Y|5.0|This second edition contains some supplemental material at the end of the book, but I was unable to detect any changes to the story content from the first edition.<br /><br />David Weber's &#34;Honor Harrington&#34; series is so good that I have read and occasionally reread the entire series. &#34;Honor of the Queen&#34; is the second book of the series. Personally, I always prefer to read an author's book series in sequence to enjoy the development of characters and the complexity of a story line. As I write this in March 2013, the direct series consists of 12 books, six books in the related universe, five anthologies, and two young adult books -- all related to the direct series.
B009K0P10K|3.0|A little too convoluted.....But the characters are still interesting and engaging enough to spend the time.  Let's hope they wrap it up with a decent ending.

B002UPQ246|5.0|The Dock of the Bay is the first of a number of posthumously released Otis Redding albums. It contains the classic title track it contains a number of singles and B-sides.<br /><br />\\"The Dock of the Bay\\" which was Otis first nummer one hit-single, sad after his death, indicated that Redding was widening his musical influences, and the song is not very strictly based in the blues patterns which most of his songs were. It very sad  that Redding died so young and was never given the opportunity to follow this new exciting direction.<br /><br />There are several other fine songs on this album, but the title-track is the immortal classic.<br /><br />\\"I Love you More than Words Can Say\\" is a great soulful ballad written by Eddie Floyd and Booker T. Redding himself was the co-writer of the bluesy \\"Let Me Come on Home\\", which has some very nice guitar licks, which is not very often found on Redding's recordings.<br /><br />Another great ballad is \\"The Glory of Love\\", which was written by Billy Hill.<br /><br />Another favourite is the closing track \\"Ole Man Trouble\\", which was written by Redding and which dates back to 1965.<br /><br />\\"Tramp\\" which is a duet with Carla Thomas shows a more informal and humorous side of Redding.

0547884591|5.0|Having read Tim's other books, I was excited to get this one, as I enjoy cooking immensely.  Once I ordered it, I happened to be listening to the Adam Carolla podcast a few minutes after, and he was talking to Tim Ferriss.  The way the author described the book made me have serious second thoughts (he might want to work on his interview skills).<br /><br />I went back on Amazon and tried to cancel my order, but it was too late.  The book was ready to be shipped.  I just thought I would peruse it, and then send it back.  Boy am I glad that I didn't.  This turned out to be a helluva fun read.<br /><br />Whether you can cook or not, get this book.<br /><br />And Tim, if you happen to read this, seriously, learn to describe it better in your future interviews.
B008P3SPVU|4.0|Thiis movie exceeded my expectations. I always like a good realistic feel good movie that can keep your interested. I recommend this movie.

B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I took my little ones to see this in the theater, and safe to say all of us loved it! The visuals were so bright and colorful that even my then-18-month old enjoyed herself, and my husband and I enjoyed the throwbacks to classic characters that we played as kids on the original game systems. The dialogue is funny and of course there is a good moral to the story. Little kids, big kids, or adults (big big kids lol) will at least LIKE this movie, if not love it.

B007GE2H3G|2.0|While I had heard of TinTin, I never read the comic strip and had no emotional attachment to the character. Apparently, lots of people do. However, I have a feeling that those people are not into hyperactive 3D movies with animation that is alternately super-realistic and ultra-cartoonish. (Read: older generation.) At the same time, for those of us who wouldn't know TinTin from Rin Tin Tin, the film is lacking a central character we can really latch onto.<br /><br />It's kind of a shame, because as animated by Spielberg & Co. and acted by Jamie Bell, this TinTin person is kind of likeable. He's attractive, he's smart, he's almost human... and yet... there's just something off about him and his world. TinTin himself actually makes it through what's called the \\"uncanny valley,\\" which is a term among 3D animators. Basically, when a character falls into that area, it means that they are realistic enough to be human, but at the same time there's something inhuman about them. The human brain can't really process the contradiction, and so the character just seems weird and off-putting. This was the state of the art about five years ago.<br /><br />Now, TinTin makes it through the valley and seems very real, but the problem is that I'm not really sure how old he's supposed to be. Visually, he really looks like an adolescent, with his flawless skin and short pants, and Bell's youthful voice adds to that illusion. When we first meet him, he also takes immediate interest in a model ship at a flea market stand -- something which seems like a teen boy interest, not an adult one. And yet... TinTin is apparently a famous journalist who has his own (rather posh) apartment.<br /><br />Again, if I were familiar with the comic strip, this would probably all make sense. They stopped publishing the original TinTin comics in 1976, if Wikipedia is to be believed. I think you can see the disconnect between the source material and the audience right there.<br /><br />So... we have this totally autonomous but realistically animated teen boy running around on his own. Meanwhile, he's accompanied by his faithful dog Snowy. Now, while Snowy is an endearing character, he also falls sharply on the other side of the uncanny valley -- that is, way too animated looking to be realistic. And so do most of the other human characters that we meet. While it may be true to the original comic, this is where everything falls apart. Cartoonish denizens of this world would be totally acceptable if the entire film were done in old school 2D animation style, or if TinTin himself did not look so real. The two together, though, are just visually jarring, and took me right out of everything the first time that \\"real-ish\\" TinTin met his first cartoon-face human.<br /><br />I won't even get into the plot, which rockets TinTin into his adventures, and then lets him conveniently stumble upon one clue after another way too quickly. I can feel Mr. Spielberg's love and nostalgia for the material, but he should have left it in the visual vernacular of its era. This is a perfect example of \\"sometimes, the most advanced technology is not the best tool for telling the story.\\" The sets, lighting, physical animation and all of that is beautiful, and stunningly real when it wants to be. As a bunch of pretty pictures, the film is a knockout. However... pictures are not a story. Humans are. When a couple of your humans -- mainly the hero and villain -- look like real people, while everyone else looks like either an animation test gone wrong or the grotesque failure of a genetic experiment, empathy becomes impossible.<br /><br />That said, this is probably the perfect film to stick the grandparents and kids in front of, because both of them will find something to relate to. But if you're between 6 and 60... you'll find yourself humming the scenery, wondering what TinTin really does for his money (blackmail Belgian priests?) and, while admiring Mr. Spielberg's always incredible mastery of film making, lament that he wasted it on this labor of love that never could have found an audience, because the combination of source and realization were born to be at complete odds with each other.<br /><br />If only he'd gone full live-action, he might have given TinTin to a new generation. Instead, in trying to pander to both, he's satisfied neither, and dropped everything right into the middle of that uncanny valley.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Once you start it... you're hooked. Its intelligent crack for the brain. So beautifully written and acted that you are pulled in emotionally from the start. Filled with both heroes and villains subtle enough to carry on episode to episode and season to season.
B004U8VWLE|3.0|Very dark lighting, more angst than I could process in one sitting. You could never really definitively say what's going on. The sex factor was twisty and weird and the mother/daughter thing -- well, that was just painful to watch. The dancing was lovely although Natalie, even with a stand-in, did not convince me she was prima donna quality. I think most people loved the movie or hated it. I could take it or leave it. Wish I had seen it for free as I don't think it was quite worth paying for.

B00AMBLXP8|2.0|Interesting theme, but full of &#34;all too common&#34; 8th grade, toilet talk jokes.  I'm not a prude, but I am offended by the entertainment industry thinking that a play or movie can only be good if it is saturated with foul language and immature jokes.  I have worked and lived in real life situations that have plenty of individuals whose vocabularies are so limited that they must fill it with expletives, but these are not the occasions that I like to spend my money on to be entertained.  Sorry, but the movie could have been a lot better if the screen play writers had not resorted to so many &#34;cheap shot&#34; jokes.

B006LSZECO|1.0|I typically love mysteries, but this particular one was a huge let  down. I do not like the message it sent. The perfect little girl grown into &#34;perfect&#34; young woman can do horrible things to others to get what she wants and suffer no consequences, this is not the way life works. It brings up the point that people's actions have no consequences, which is not true and yet continues to be a thought process trend in our society. I sincerely disliked this book and would not recommend it to anyone.

0307987698|5.0|my son 4 years and daughter 2 years love it!! they ask me to read it to them almost every night!
B0094K1K8I|3.0|the ending is terrible. Paranormal Activity 3 has a lot of creepy moments. However, the ending could have been a lot better. It ended just when I became interested in the story.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|I purchased this DVD for myself as this was one of my favorites as a child.  Great memories!  I recommend this for kids and adults who enjoy the Disney classics.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|These Seiko S5s are my favs.  I now own three(beige, blue & black).<br />They're light, not too big but very cool, & i like the offset crown that<br />doesn't dig into your wrist.  Probably the last watches i'll buy!!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This is a must see movie of the year. I was very impressed by the story and the way in which the movie was presented.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Bought this as one of my wife's Christmas gifts. She is absolutely &#34;Gaga&#34; over it. She loves it, me too, so what more could we want.<br />Thanks
B001MYIXAC|2.0|I am a college student and at the encouragement of my Cinema professor, I bought the film to watch.  I'm still trying to figure out why he thinks the movie is so great.  I'm giving him my copy just in case something happens to his.
6305882592|5.0|This is one of my favorite all time movies so I was pleased when it shipped so quickly! The quality was perfect!
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Love the movie, not only for kids, but adults will enjoy this as well. Do not quite understand why the blu ray is not available separately, but other than that great purchase. Great lesson.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|If musicals are your thing...you've got to see this.  It is a fictional love story set in the 1960s in the turbulent years of anti-war protest, the struggle for free speech and civil rights.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really liked each book, each had its own struggles and plots.  These books were well researched and well written.  When I talked to friends and said I read them, they were appalled.  However, they had not read them.  One friend said they were trash...but she read all three!!!  I loved them--the were a big change from the typical historical fiction I read. I would and have recommended these to others!
B003JSSPSY|5.0|My favorite TV series of all time.  Great storytelling, setting, plot...the only negative is probably the half-baked soundtrack.  I have a couple degrees in music, so my standards for music composition on a professional level are high....in other words, most people probably won't have an issue with the soundtrack. This series also has an awesome love story.
B000683VI4|5.0|From the first time that I watched this movie...it has been one of my favorites.  A true love story through and through.

B001DCQIAA|5.0|Early seventy's karajan schumann, is, simply, the best recordings on the market. As you , already know, karajan, has no peers, when it comes to richard strauss, brahms, mahler, wagner, or, sibelious. He, is,without doubt, the greatest conduntor of the century. No modern recordings come close!enjoy!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Could not put this book down and had to keep reading even when my eyes were closing. Such a wonderful love story between a woman and a man and his two children. Please read it and enjoy,you will not be sorry.

B004LQI0QK|5.0|Too many words can be said about this movie, this man, this war. But this is an absolute masterpiece about a man who was born for war. The movie showcases this brilliantly. Named my son after him, a true American hero

B003EI2EH2|5.0|I've read just about every exercise/diet book out there. This one sets itself apart from just about every other one based on Tim's adherence to critical thinking and the scientific process. Not to mention its just flat out fun to read and in a very entertaining writing style.<br /><br />If you want results and not the latest fad, for just about anything related to the body then this is the best your money can buy!
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Great graphics and story. Challenging enough to keep you thinking but not frustrating. A game worth the price! Need more games like this one.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|George Martin writes novels that consume you. This is another one. Its slow in the beginning but once you push through that the novel is without a doubt wonderful!<br /><br />Only one king can stand!
0307887448|5.0|As a 35 year old male geek, I can say that this book was solidly in my wheelhouse.  There really isn't a whole lot to say that hasn't already been said, but what I will say is just read it.  It is quick, fun, and will leave you wanting more (but hoping the author doesn't write any more and spoil it).
B0095P31L6|5.0|We first got this movie for our movie night and I fell asleep during it. I thought Rango was unappealing (looks and voice, even though I like Depp), I didn't like the style of the animation so much, and since I didn't care to watch the main character, it was difficult to get into the story (although I did appreciate the complexity of some of the scenes, such as the <spoiler>enclosure flying through the air</spoiler>.<br /><br />Then Amazon Prime started offering streaming and my two-year-old chose it to watch one night on my iPad. Nearly every night he asks to watch it, and we have on many nights, at least until he falls asleep. After watching it over and over (sometimes just listening), I've come to appreciate the dialogue, settings, and camera shots modeled after familiar scenes from westerns. It's actually very well done and has some very funny and clever dialogue. The opening scene, which is the one that turned me off the first time I saw it, has now become one of my favorites. It completely cracks up my son, which is funny in itself, and he copies the character and tries to repeat what he says. My older kids and I have also committed some lines to memory, such as those spoken by Beans the first time she meets Rango.<br /><br />Overall, if you don't find it too interesting to start, I'd say give it a full thirty minutes. If you've seen (and enjoyed) old westerns, you'll probably end up liking it.
B00BIR381W|5.0|Alison is A! meaning she is Redcoat in the Season 3 finale, A dAngerous gAme and more will be revealed on the Season 4 premiere on June 11th
B0074VA2T2|3.0|Ok, so it's a basic counting game but it's supposed to be the Very Hungry Caterpillar and he's not in the game.<br />My youngest is at school right now and he still loves this book so I thought he would like to play the game with the same theme but I think he's going to be just as disappointed as I am as the caterpillar isn't in the game. I was expecting some animated caterpillar to eat the fruit or at least make some appearance. I tried each level and yes it's repetitive but it's for young kids and I didn't see the caterpillar once. Sure he just sits there on the bottom of the screen and doesn't do anything, so he's there but it's not what I was expecting at all. The game would have been a lot better if the caterpillar had made an actual appearance.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Super fun game. When I first got my kindle I and got this I was amazed. Nice graphics. 1 downside we get the updates last and not a lot of blocks/accessories in creative. If you want to switch ur worlds to creative or survival, download pocket inventor editor. Thanks for reading
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this book in 3 days. The lead character, Pat Peoples, is a modern day grown-up Holden Caulfield. Excellent book!
B00B2TTVNU|5.0|I was completely blown away by the playing here.  I like the recording of the Rachmaninov third piano concerto even better than Horowitz' famous recordings!  The detail in the playing is so easy to hear.  Lisitsa does not sound like just another piano playing these concertos.  She puts her own personal stamp on them.  This is the Rach 3 I can listen to over and over and never get bored.  I cannot recommend these recordings highly enough.  If you only plan on getting one complete Rach set of Concertos, LET IT BE THIS ONE!<br /><br />I can't wait to hear her Liszt recordings!
B00BMVTS1S|1.0|I do not usually review products, but I feel it necessary to make an exception for The Hobbit. The film was poorly done. In trying to spice things up, Peter Jackson turned this into a cheap Hollywood flick which relies more on the overwrought battle scenes than on substance or story. The dangers (like the battle scenes) are exaggerated to the point that it is no longer fun to watch, and this is made worse by the pace--which is too fast, so that you are wrenched from one overly dramatic scene to another. Fans of the books will be sorely disappointed since the film necessarily takes a tremendous degree of liberty in order to accomplish the supra-fabulousness it strives for: much of the story is deleted, battle scenes are trumped up and many scenes are just added right in. The appeal of the book is the humble characters and similarly humble story-line. The film-makers completely missed this and the end result is that very few will be pleased with the film, especially not Tolkien fans.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a very useful application.  It works well and does what I need it to do.  I find it to be.helpful with managing my checkbook.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|One of the most entertaining games I've purchased. Iwould like to see more games like this one. Keep them coming!
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|Game was fun for awhile, but then there are parts where you get stuck it seems like forever. After the last time getting stuck, and taking way too long to get through the level I deleted it. I am sure others will enjoy it much more than I did.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I liked the game on the computer, but this app sucks. Every time I play there is a glitch, and no one ever likes glitches. The game crashes often and I have already had to delete and re download the game. DO NOT BUY THIS APP. PLAY IT ON THE COMPUTER or something.

B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Its basis is good. I like wasting time with this and a couple other games.  But this one compared to the other two lack in advancing quickly. And I've seen games hand over cash/gold a lot easier but I appreciate that not everything is meant to be spent with the cash.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|What an inspirational read...I want to read it again...reminds me of all the \\"important\\" things in life that truly must be focussed on
B005O7PSRO|5.0|In one review, the writer compared this to Moonlighting.....where Bruce Willis got his start...I thought it was a good compo Me.  I was upset they took off &#34;Lie to Me&#34; with Tim Roth. Then when castle came on, it just seemed to be another mentalist type show. And in many ways it is.But the ratings and the fact Castle is the number one crime drama watched in and out of this country to date suggests there are man different components as well. And the fans know this, and love this show like no other.  Castle cant read minds of people. But the two shows have many of the same attributes. Man and a Woman, doing a job, same job i might add, and sexual tension. I have to say, i have been catching up, and i am up to date. I now am hooked on this show. It drives me nuts because i now have to make time for yet another show....What i do love about the show is Becket (the woman detective). She is what really got me to stay tuned in. I grew to appreciate Castle. There are so many layers to Castle's character then what they allow Castle to have. However, They need to do a little better with the writing and develop more layers to the characters between Castle and Becket. And If they do what they did with Bones? The ratings will feel it.  It is in its 5th season. Going into the 6th season or year next season. It's time to either put these two together or let it go. And if they do put them together, we should not have to watch them break up after four episodes like they did in &#34;House&#34;, when House dated Cuddy.....I would like them to do is break from the traditional tv themes....No reason to make us wait, then put them together, then break them up shortly after. I am just hoping they come up with some original  material to work with, develop  the characters a bit more. I have no problem with them getting the two together, meaning castle and Becket. But do it already. Let the audience have some fun. The woman seem to love Castle, the men have to love his partner...she is beautiful, and they are playing her down...I like her even more than the lead woman detective on the Mentalist... I think Castle is fun to watch, and yes, the story line, or theme is something we have seen at  times especially in the mentalist.....but there is enough difference in the writing , acting, and the actors themselves, that make this show worth watching. It's good fun, and I would say its a must see. I gave it 5 stars because it deserves it. But they need to do something with Castle and Beckett. And move their relationship along a little faster now. With tv executives ripping shows off the air just when we fall in love with them, they don't have as much time as they use to. They need to move things along a little faster. If they do, this show will have countless years left. .I say it's a must see....I do love this show.........beautiful, and they are playing her down...I like her even more than the lead woman detective on the Mentalist...

B009GQ57ES|5.0|18 tracks for $4... can't beat that deal. I could have easily downloaded this album for free but chose to pay for it out of principle. It's an EXTREMELY reasonable price, why cant more artists offer music without gouging the customer. Way to break the mold Macklemore! You are doing it right!<br /><br />Musically the album is awesome as well. The beats are fresh, the lyrics are thoughtful, the feelings are real.<br /><br />A+ would recommend!

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|stunningly beautiful, this allegorical film mesmerised me. The gorgeous shots and photography alone make it worthwhile. I loved the scenes of the animals and zoo who I feel are the main characters. People seemed almost secondary.  the movie is simple enough for young children but thoughtful  and compassionate at the same time. I loved it and would have liked to see women playing a more meaningful role. I have a renewed interest in tigers and zoos.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|I wanted to like this movie. I have been waiting years for Ridley Scott to make another Alien movie, however, this movie was a total let down.  This movie has great production value and is expansive. It also has an interesting idea at its helm. But it doesn't live up to any of it. The plot is choppy and full of holes. The characters are paper thing. The monster at the end feels tacked on. And the scientist in the movie seem to be very stupid. What the hell was he thinking. I think the only reason this movies isn't universally panned is because Ridley Scott directed it and because people want a sequel that shows the alien homeworld. This is not a good movie.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|this and despicable me are some of the movies that I could watch everyday. from toddlers, to teenagers to the us the parents, we love singing the songs &#34;greedy little dirtbag&#34;  and acting out scenes.  Great movie!

034580404X|4.0|I bought this series for my sister at Christmas.<br />She read it quickly and passed it on to my wife who also couldn't put it down.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Listen, whatever you're reading - STOP.  Put that book down, buy this one and read the hell out of it.<br /><br />Sometimes I forget how good books can be.  I plod through books sometimes, feeling like I've read 100 pages when I've read only 10.  I put the book down and six weeks later remember I am supposed to finish it.<br /><br />Not this one.  Not Wool.<br /><br />Hugh Howey is an exceptional storyteller.  Wool is ridiculously well-written and engaging, all the while desperate, bleak, and suffocating.  Trust me - these adjectives all belong together in a single sentence.  My husband even says to me, \\"I can already tell you how this story will go.  Everybody THINKS the outside is toxic and uninhabitable, but they'll come to find out it's livable..\\"  Not only is my husband WRONG like a wrong person on Wrong Day, but Howey shames him by demonstrating his talents by weaving hope into this dystopian wonderland.<br /><br />Quick synopsis - in a post-apocalyptic setting, remaining generations of humans and some animals (dogs, bunnies, and rats are mentioned) are existing below-ground in a cylindrical structure buried very very deep into the Earth's surface.  Population control is strict and brutal.  For every birth there must be a death.  Birth control is implanted in the very-young.  Howey has masterfully created a culture and its norms within the walls of the silo, and things are status quo for the reader for only a very short period of time.  Things quickly start to unravel, and the wool begins to retreat from their and our eyes...<br /><br />Read this book, seriously.  Begin the journey that is Wool, and you won't regret it.

B0043RSK3K|5.0|Here, the author provides the untold stories of what goes on behind closed doors; the real reasons presidents do the things they do.

B00AKFG15S|2.0|Although the first two books in the Clifton Chronicles series were good, this one has a rather lame plot, is too predictable and frankly speaking doesn't really have much to say...its a shame really, as Archer is capable of putting together a much better plot
B005PK56TA|4.0|I see why season one was nominated for an Emmy last year.  Jessica Lange was awesome. Very well written stories.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|One of the best written, but saddest, books I've ever read. Loved Green's framing of Hazel's father.  He was so compassionate, yet macho. The whole story is a tear jerker about teens,  in love, in true love, fighting life threatening stuff. Cool beans!
B009RI4FRU|1.0|\\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" boasts a number of marquee stars who may has well have been passersby plucked off a street and whisked to the set for this Wes Anderson quirkfest. The actors, young and adult, are essentially stuffed costumes whose performances are throttled and limited to the point they seem like lifeless animatronic creations. Oh, wait, I suppose that is the point.<br /><br />After all, this movie is a stylized animation parading as though it has real people. The scenery is real, though filmed as though it was the sort of fake background we were supposed to ignore in the earlier days of film because we could not take our eyes off the star power.<br /><br />Somewhere embedded in this glop is a story, but it is hard to care much about the young runaways because every emotion and reaction is too stilted and scripted to elicit any empathy. I think the only thing in the movie that raised a bit of concern for me was thinking how bad beer would taste when poured into an unrinsed glass that had had milk in it.<br /><br />I wish I could get the time I spent watching this flick added back to however many hours I still have on this earth.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This saga does not disappoint.  With outstanding acting, continual surprising twists and turns in plots and characters, you will be addicted to more, more, more!  Can't wait for the next season.

B0083Z614S|5.0|Such a wonderful story that covers so many feelings, emotions and relationships.  Really made me open my mind to how it felt to be a child again, and to see the world through their mind.
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|Great story. Loved the awkwardness. The Priest did an amazing job. Just kind of slow at parts which would be expected in a true life story. Be all and all very funny and interesting.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|Make sure you read the manual. Helped with white noise issues. Not 100% gone, but honestly 85-90%, and I haven't fully adjusted my camcorder's attenuation. MAKE SURE YOU MAKE IT LOW FOR THE CAMCORDER. Read the manual and you will be happy with your purchase. I am!
1439153663|5.0|I loved this book. Unlike some other readers, I was very attached to the characters. The book was hard to put down and I wondered what would happen to the characters. Not sure I loved the point of view and didn't care for ending much at all.
B004PGO25O|5.0|Sound, practical advice on how to conquer resistance and ship.  No tricks.  Just show up and do the work.  That is how you overcome the resistance.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I love listening to this in the car. I relive the movie each time.<br />I even like Russel Crowe's voice!
B00BESM14U|4.0|This is a nice film about the trials of a marginalized high school student who finds a true group of friends. It is an engaging film but the acting and story are somewhat short of great.
B005PTYOTE|5.0|Wanted to see this series for a long time.  It was worth the wait.  Lots of excitement! Some parts were predictable, but still, lots of sitting on edge of the seat moments.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Great musicians. Wonderful arrangements. An all-around exquisite listening experience. I bought this for my wife, since she is a major Josh Groban fan and wound up thoroughly enjoying it myself. All that Echoes remains in the brain for a long time. And that's a good thing.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|In my estimation this was the best of the Mission Impossible Series!  Acting was superb.  Lots of suspense and excitement. Kudos!
B008220C38|1.0|This adaptation of Anna Karenina gets a big zero in my book.  The film was \\"stylized\\" to have the storyline occur on a theatrical stage.  For me, this was a total distraction from the substance of the beautiful story.  And in fact, it  completely obliterated it.  The costumes of course were beautiful, and it was also well-acted.  But those things were pretty vacuous with the life of the story sucked out of it.
B007Y36K46|4.0|I wish I had the movie in hand, but it is on all my things, iPad, phone, computer and tv, so I guess that's good
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This app is very simple and easy to use.  It meets the function I was going for.  Love it :)
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book was quite different from other books I have read.  It made me laugh so many times because the main character got into so many difficult spots and yet always managed to get out of them.  The different characters really lent so much to the story.  I would recommend this as light reading to someone who just wants to enjoy some laughs.
B004U8VX2M|3.0|Since Downton Abbey was on break, I was looking something similar.  I can't say I love it as much.  It looks like a good series but I think maybe the accents are too heavy for me to understand.
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|All around bad story.  No atmosphere.  Just plain stupid. I would not recommend for anyone to watch this movie.  Not worth a dime.
B007REV4T8|5.0|They just keep getting better.  The chase scenes are great, the story intriquing and the gadgets---as always make the movie interesting.
B009D95IJM|3.0|The book is printed with excellent quality and the price is just right; it's an inexpensive addition to the cat lover's home library.<br />However I have been following the Cat vs. Human  blog for awhile and the Internet version is a lot funnier.<br /><br />Perhaps a newer edition with the latest material would be more appropriate for the fans of the site, but this is all personal taste.<br />The item itself arrived on time and in perfect condition, all the pages look and feel great and it will make you smile for sure.<br />Cat lover or not.
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|I wish there were more books to this series, it was light reading.  I thought the book was a quick read.
1449410243|4.0|I've been a huge fan of the oatmeal for a few years,  I bought this as a birthday present and the book was great.<br />I'd give it 5 stars if it had contained a few more cartoons that weren't already on the website.<br />That said, the humor is just what you expect, the poster looks great mounted on the wall and it's really a great print.
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|It was nice to have a small series to read in-between my larger, deeper books.  I loved this quick read.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Good story right from the start Morgan can really tell a great tale can't wait o read the next book .
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Great movie! If you liked the other series movie then you will love this one.  Grabbed my attention at the start and held it until the credits.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|Paul Simon had a big solo career in the 70s, and these songs show where he got his chops from. All AM radio favorites, these songs bring back memories of my youth growing up as the British invasion slowed down and American songwriters came to the front. Play this CD, sit  back, relax, and go back to a simpler time in your life when listening to music was a real treat. Enjoy the harmonies and wonderful lyrics...
B006G2124E|4.0|A bit too much of a good outcome here; it would not have happened this way in the Jackson of 1963.  In particular, the relationship between Millie and her employers is as unrealistic as the servant/master relationships in Downton Abbey.  Hilly is a rather weak villain, in the real situation she would have been able to destroy the lives of just about everybody who displeased her.  However, the portrait of southern women in the sixties is dead accurate--and appalling.
B003TH14H4|5.0|I tend to buy episodes of series (cord cutter), I've bought all the Castle episodes to date and don't regret it.<br /><br />Basic premise, Castle - Mystery writer, kills off his major character and gets &#34;involved&#34; with Detective Beckett, starts following her around for &#34;research&#34;.<br /><br />Pretty much standard fare on a lot of these types of series.<br /><br />The episodes are very formulaic, but then again so is Hot Chocolate, it makes for a very dependable, reliable viewing experience.<br /><br />Generally there's always a lead story, the murder being investigated and a background story, progressing the relationship of the characters in the cast.<br /><br />So, it has violence, it has some emotion and it has humor.<br /><br />A pretty decent balance.<br /><br />Now, I got on the Castle train fairly recently, so I sort of marathoned them while mainlining caffeine to stay awake.  So, some of it rubbed a bit raw at points.  You'll hear the same lines in different episodes, &#34;You clean up fine Beckett...&#34;, that sort of thing.  Minor annoyance though.<br /><br />Some of the episodes are a bit weak, but for the most part they deliver admirably and are worth watching more than once.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Same plot, same characters, same everything.  Good effects but ultimately kind of a boring show.  Noomi Rapace is not as interesting as Sigourney Weaver.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|You don't see many of these stories with happy endings- but this well crafted documentary shows the character of Rodriguez - a highly talented happy, peaceful man
B000BTC5LW|5.0|The tribute bands are good. The effort they put forth is great. The music they play is outstanding. The show they put on is amazing.<br /><br />But they are not Pink Floyd.<br /><br />No tribute band can ever equal what Pink Floyd gave us in the many years they were performing.<br /><br />They were simply the best.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Great app, but not at the right location. I live near Hayward Wi. , not Cornwall England. It seems the weather in that area is much warmer than here.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love this game, I am so hooked that nothing else seems to get done around the house or at work.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|It Aden's he wants us to get attached just to pull people away. Excellent story with many twists in plot lines to keep it interesting. Would like to know more about Robs victories.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game, you'll be hooked if you like solitaire with a flare. Time flies while playing this game. You'll be hooked.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I bought this for my wife's Kindle Fire and have 'borrowed' the Kindle quite a bit to play the game.  I have enjoyed the easy to learn game play and the unique obstacles that are added with each Season (Magic Hats, Bees, etc).  I have not paid for any in-game content.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I enjoyed this game. Very well thought out and can be addictive. Very well worth the price you will love this game!
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|Let me state upfront that I read The Hobbit as well as Lord of the Rings (LOTR) when I was young and multiple times after my initial reading. I also just reread The Hobbit a few months ago while waiting for the DVD to come out. I own the extended versions of all three LOTR movies, saw all three movies in the theater (more than once on Fellowship of the Ring) and watch the DVDs fairly regularly. As a fantasy/sci-fi dork with children who love the same genre I should have been the perfect consumer of The Hobbit. I was leery about the movie based on the reviews and the lead up to the film so I actually decided to wait until the DVD came out. It came out yesterday (quite quickly I thought from a release date in mid-December) and our copy came from Amazon on the release date so after dinner we sat down as a family to watch.<br /><br />Very disappointed. Like couldn't wait for it to get over disappointed.<br /><br />I found The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey movie to be almost 3 hours of frustration. My kids mostly seemed to find it boring. Maybe I shouldn't have reread the book last month because the movie was only loosely based on it and every time the movie went astray it distracted me. I guess the comparisons were inevitable but they are valid and comparing the two trilogies is like comparing a high school play with a Broadway production.<br /><br />The Lord of the Rings trilogy was a bold, risky production that was shot all at once before anyone knew if they would have commercial success and the result was one of the best adaptations of a beloved book that you will ever find. I left the theater after The Fellowship of the Ring bummed that I had to wait a year for The Two Towers. I couldn't wait for the movies to come out each December and bought the DVD sets as soon as I could. I can say that I have not only watched the movies over and over, I have also watched most if not all of the hours of special features.<br /><br />The Hobbit has the feel of cheap exploitation; hey we made a ton of money on the LOTR movies so let's see if we can do the same thing with The Hobbit. I was quite concerned this would be the case after all the pre-production squabbling and then when it was announced that one book, The Hobbit, would be divided up into three movies while the much larger and more detailed LOTR trilogy was also done in three movies, I was definitely not excited. In many ways The Hobbit was just like so many other attempts to make a cheap buck by exploiting a beloved book. I enjoy the old cartoon version of The Hobbit more than what I watched last night.<br /><br />There are so many places where the scenes just dragged on and either were clumsy attempts at linking the Hobbit to LOTR or ridiculous action sequences to spice up events from the book:<br /><br />The backstory of the fall of the Lonely Mountain. The interminably long intro with Elijah Wood as Frodo. Every single scene involving Radagast was horrible, Radagast being turned into a failed attempt at comedy relief. The inexplicable gathering with Saruman and Galadriel in Rivendell. The random \\"pale orc\\" that was supposed to be Azog the Defiler was some of the worst CGI I have seen in a long time. The Great Goblin who looked like something from a kids cartoon rather than a fearsome beast. The escape scene from the clutches of the goblins that went on about ten times longer than necessary and included some just silly, over the top action scenes that were mediocre rehashes of the escape from Moria in the Fellowship of the Ring. The treeing of the dwarves by the goblins that devolved into a cheesy showdown between Thorin and the pale orc. Etc. Etc.<br /><br />The whole thing was almost palpably painful. The few redeeming parts, like the riddle contest between Bilbo and Gollum, we not nearly enough to make up for the clumsy, drawn out, \\"cheap thrill\\" nature of the rest of the movie. The dwarves looked ridiculous, the wargs were a downgrade from LOTR. I would prefer they start all over with a new film and cast new actors (other than Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Martin Freeman as Bilbo who was decent), better to wait five years for a decent film than to roll out parts 2 and 3 from a movie that was already too long in the first installment.<br /><br />The next two films are still pending. I am hoping that the production team can fix whatever fiasco happened with the interminably long first movie. Perhaps Smaug will be impressive enough to make up for. Maybe the final battle will be more than CGI silliness. We will see. I know this for certain, unless the reviews are over the top positive for The Hobbit, Part Deux, we will again wait for the DVD and this time we will rent it from Redbox rather than buying it.ver with a new film and cast new actors (other than Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Martin Freeman as Bilbo who was decent), better to wait five years for a decent film than to roll out parts 2 and 3 from a movie that was already too long in the first installment.<br /><br />The next two films are still pending.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|i think she was under pressure to come up with sequels its is slow and a little confusing.i hate a book that wont flow.
B007REV4T8|3.0|Received on time.  Did not like the movie that much.  I think it's one of the worst Bond movies that has been made.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its great for teaching kids how to train care for and love an animal. I like it it a great app
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|I absolutely love this soundtrack! My only complaint is that I was they had more of the riff off songs! But other than that I love it!
B004YM6JP0|4.0|I'm a huge follower and fan of the show. Been an avid watcher since day one.  Though this season isn't as good as my favorite season 2, it did create some of the character building and back story of the original family which is needed in order to continue with season 4 and the Original's show spin-off, which I'm completely psyched about. If you like supernatural type shows, good acting, and great stories, you'll like.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved it...be ready to be moved to tears, then laughter, then tears again. Especially good for those that are helping friends through a &#34;Battle&#34; with cancer.
B0086HGW42|3.0|I bought this because my 10 year old daughter likes the a team song and the rest of his music sounds pretty good too but I really bought it for her to listen too.  She likes it a lot.
B004X80QNG|5.0|I like this app syncs with the google calendar on my computer so I can carry it around and have my schedule on hand.  It is also found as an android app to so you can have either the kindle or your phone with your current schedule on hand. :)
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Excellent book delving into the mind of the minimally mentally ill patient. Having both a mother and sister (undiagnosed) with Bipolar disorder gave me a better appreciation for Pat and his struggle to maintain some normalcy in his life. I am disappointed that I saw the movie before I read the book!! Always different...The thing I enjoyed about the movie more than the book was the exploration of Pat's father and his gambling and OCD issues, of course played brilliantly by Robert DeNiro.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|IT is a great hard cover to allow the kindle to be kept safe.  I like the flap in the front to protect the screen and use as a stand when needed.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Again, wished I had read the book before the movie. Both were well written. However, book as always able to delve deeper into the characters and what they are feeling. Excellent read. This was my first Nicholas Sparks book, but after reading this I purchased The Notebook and its sequel.
B008N1V11U|5.0|My son loves the game and plays it over and over.  He recommends it highly for hours of play.  GREAT GRAPHICS!
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|A great book series for kids and the ability to read it on her tablet makes my daughter want to read more.  Recommended for ages 8+.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|The Sword of Truth was an excellent series.  The Stone of Tears picks right where Wizard's First Rule left off.  Continuing the story of Richard and his growth as a man and a wizard.<br /><br />I began reading the Sword of Truth about the same time as I reading the Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan.  Both series were spell binding and they kept you on the edge of your seat. But Gookind impressed me because he was able to keep the intensity going throughout the entire series.  The Stone of Tears is a worthwhile read but needs Wzards's First Rule to help it make sense.
B004SBX112|1.0|I have paid for this purchase as of last month and I have yet to receive it on my ipad. This is the epitome of horrible customer service and I will not be recommending anyone purchase this product.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Having owned the quadrilogy on VHS for many years, finally upgrading it to Blu-ray is a huge step up. But the extra pixels in the video aren't the only things making this boxset worth owning.<br /><br />Filled with a metric ton of special features (which would easily take you a good couple of days to finish in entirety), including several documentaries, alternate cuts (including the fabled Fincher's Director's Cut of Alien 3), commentaries and trivia bits, the Alien Anthology boxset will quench the thirst of any Alien fan.
B0011Z7JRU|3.0|I'll write a real review, when they have a better mastered version. Perhaps they should offer music in the .wav file format? I'm no technogeek, but there's a program from DVD soft, that takes music from an .mp3 and converts it to .wav and restores the original sound via a more comprehensive capture of sound data. - I had some disc I made from assorted downloads from my past, and it had gotten scratched, a bit, and I used their software to restore it, and it's incredible how much better it sounds.<br /><br />Also, I had gotten the Japan Import of Physical Graffiti about a year ago, but lost it. - I will buy it again because the Japanese really take sound quality seriously. It was a SHM disc with special layers that are used in LCD screens, or something to that effect, as well as something called K2 mastering.<br /><br />We'll get into how good the album is once they have something better than the MP3.<br /><br />Any audiophiles finding the same thing?
0307887960|5.0|This can be purchased on it's own or with it's companion, the Duken Diet.  It gives an overview of the eating philosophy and great plans for meals.  Excellent addition to my cook book shelf.
0736041850|4.0|I bought this book as it was a recommended addition to a Great Courses series that I had purchased. The book shows drawings of all muscle groups and some exercises that work them. This is not a technical physiology book but is a great supplemental book. The graphics were great and give very good insights as to how the muscle groups work and where they are located in our body.

B0089LOKHG|5.0|Lauren oliver is by far my favorite author. Her books are amazing and i LOVED this book! It's suspenseful and heart-wrenching. Your emotions seem to match everything lena feels. Its beautiful.. definitely recommended!
B001GUXJQA|4.0|Following new case open up new emotions while re visiting the existing ones from an new direction . Again story wee developed wi
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This series is a little like a cross between Downton Abbey and Little House on the Prairie. Lively characters and dialogue. Engaging story lines. Like watching an historical fiction novel.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Totally funny! The main character is a psycho, which is entertaining. Can't wait to see how the movie compares. Blah
B007N8RULO|5.0|This game is easy to play. I find it very addictive. Never get tired playing it.Great game for ages 10 and older.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|It's weird to read from a teen boy perspective, but I enjoyed it. I nice and fluffy read. I have recommend this book already to my babysitter.
B00B2270P8|3.0|It was in but I would have expected way more scenes than it offered....even as much as I luv the movie the 1st version was practically the same...;0/
B007REV4YI|5.0|I enjoyed the action scenes, of course (the first chase scene is especially fun), but I also enjoyed the story line that gave insight into Bond's childhood and M's character.
B0082POM2W|5.0|I don't like scary books or movies. So when I heard the book club choice would be a Stephen King novel, I tensed up. Then I heard that this wasn't &#34;one of those&#34;, it had a time travel theme, and I became completely on board. I ordered it immediately since it has 840 pages or so and I was concerned about having enough time to devote to digesting it. What a terrific surprise...I couldn't put it down. Read some every night and flew through it over the course of a week. Stephen King has crafted an engrossing, inventive novel that was thrilling without any tedium. How is that possible for such a long book?...I guess it's because he is the master. Everyone in my book group loved it. Only one person had a little difficulty getting into it initially, but then the story took flight for her as well. Would highly recommend.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|A VERY HEART WARMING STORY.  REMINDS US THAT DOGS ARE TRUE FRIENDS. MADE ME MISS MY SIBERIAN HUSKY - MY PROTECTOR.
0205313426|5.0|If you write, you should have this book. And use it! One's writing style will improve even if the book is opened at random and advice taken from that page.
B00A6RVRXG|4.0|I find myself listening to this again and again as it grows on me. Although it might be considered lo-fi, there are lots of different styles and textures throughout the CD
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Entertaining story. Well constructed with good enough, if not great writing. Would definitely read more from this author. Maybe I didn't quite love it, but I liked it a lot
072325804X|5.0|I have all the 23 tales in the small books but when I read this volume included additional stories (including the Rabbit's Christmas Party which I really wanted to see) I ordered it. I wasn't in any way prepared for the beauty of this volume! I somehow missed that it comes in a slipcover, which is GORGEOUS. There are intros to the stories as well, which are very interesting and provide additional insight into the stories. If you love Beatrix Potter it would be difficult to be disappointed with this book.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I loved the movie.  I watched it with children who ranged from ages 14 to 2 and they laughed and enjoyed this movie a lot.  The message was very uplifting and the characters were great.  No foul language or sexual innuendos.. Finally a great family film that has a message and offers great laughs for every age in the family. 2 thumbs up!
1452113432|5.0|I love Rachel Khoo and her simplistic method of cooking in a tiny little kitchen.  You should check out her television show as it is as entertaining as this cookbook!
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Not a movie I would see again, but definitely worth the time once. Character development was great, most of the performances were better than average.
B004GYY714|5.0|I take it into the spa and I am magically transported to to preteen years. There is NO static unlike my radio, and I can listen to home town radio or Crusin' the Avenue in our hot rod.  New tunes, show tunes, or news radio.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I love this game!never get tired of playing it!<br /> wish there was a way to add another player so that my kids can play on their own too lol
B000FCKGPC|3.0|This was certainly my least favorite of the series.  It almost seems as though the author was struggling to bridge book 3 and book 5.  There were so many characters that have not been introduced before this book and so I felt lost and felt like the author had no direction himself.  Having said that, I still think one must read it before book 5 which is excellent!
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I can relive every moment of the movie, which I loved. I keep it in my car and play it all the time.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|just got the game and so far very enjoyable and I would reccomend it to other gamers.check it out for yourself.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Can't tell you anything about it but just read it! One of those books that you don't want to put down.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Wonderful cd. I love the well written soulful songs on this album, perfect for any mood and exciting to listen to all day! It is so hard to pick just one favorite but I will have to choose Let the Groove Get In for dancing and Pusher Love Girl for mellow moods.
B001A4LYN2|5.0|Daniel day Lewis is god. The music is phenomenal, and the story is simple, yet complicated enough to leave you more than satisfied. Watch it.
0316228532|5.0|Fun book, enjoyed reading it, nice departure for JK Rowling and not for kids for sure but great for adults
B00899F0G8|5.0|I love this show! My favorite season by far. So much mystery and excitement. Plus the outfits are awesome. A+
0553062182|2.0|Thought this would be more insightful but it was mainly boring to me.  Perhaps others will get more out of it.
0783240287|1.0|The quality of this DVD is so poor that I felt sick when I tried watching it.  The sound goes up and down, the colors are so faded that it looks like an old washed-out picture (or a black and white movie which has been &#34;colorized&#34;).
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|graphics are very nice. loading is simple, no real lag time between levels. tutorial very easy to use game is a lot fun and extremely addictive
B0011UBDTK|3.0|I finally got my set.  Some of the CDs didn't work so well and I couldn't watch the whole episode.
B00459EZLW|5.0|SGU Season two was much much better than season one - which was very good too.  They really shaped the show into quite a series and it was poised to be a block buster for years to come.  The characters and story lines were well developed and each show left you eager for the next one.<br /><br />But unfortunately, many fans were worn out on Stargate and Season 1 of SGU was not a fan favorite so viewing audience was down.  On top of that SyFy turned the page of shows like Stargate in favor of shows that are less SciFi and more Fantasy or borderline freak/horror shows.<br /><br />Don't let the cliff hanger ending prevent you from watching this great show.  The way it ended leaves you with the feeling they may be back.
B0041D843M|5.0|This book is not going to be easy for any one to 'accept' after reading but this is probably the most comprehensive study I've ever read, in any subject matter. The amount of research, footnotes, sources properly cited, etc. makes it hard NOT to accept the implications that the author explains about the average American diet.<br /><br />READ IT NOW!!
B00571F26Y|4.0|For someone who does not know of any wheat issues with myself, I found it very informative and easy to read. Book presents information (albeit repetitively at times) at a level that is understandable by a non-healthcare professional. I haven't tried any of the recipes but have drastically cut my wheat intake with positive results.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I like racing games. I'm a girl, and I've played on Nintendo most of my life. This game is OK for what it is. It's like Diddy Kong racing, control wise, meaning it's slippery and you go all over until you find a working control style or Finally do some sort of upgrade to your car.... which takes awhile... you are timed and the checkpoints aren't exactly `right there`. It's a game that takes getting used to and will probably never replace Mario kart. Give it a shot... it's bursts of a game... but amusing.
0316227706|5.0|these fabulous creatures are so intent on what they're doing that the author has captured a side that is rarely seen.  Their magnificence, their strangeness.  Absolutely amazing.  Very very happy with this book.  Bought multiple copies to give as gifts.  Well worth it.!
B007THA4FI|5.0|Rowling spins this tale in a manner that is familiar to those who read the Harry Potter series.  But this is not a children's book.  The qualities of adulthood and teen years are well developed here: self absorption, sex drive, depression, status concerns and social cruelty.  I enjoyed this and look forward to Rowlings next work.
B003V3FVKC|5.0|Great story of how giving someone not as fortunate a chance and a little more help is a win win situation.
B0015AARJI|5.0|If you're considering a 3rd party controller stop and order this now.  The quality is unmistakable when compared to such controllers and Sony makes a solid product that lasts.  My one from 09 has sustained HEAVY use (100s of hours) and you couldn't ask for more immersive rumble and precise control...at least until PS4 comes out where they've apparently reduced latency, improved rumble, and reduced dead zones, but for now it's the best.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|I came to appreciate Clapton late.  I now have been trying to catch up, and I love this album.  I especially like his play on Double Trouble.  These Cds have come close to earning a permanent spot in the car changer.  Well worth the purchase.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I have all versions and by far this was the best to watch.  I loved it, 3D was great, will do it again on next 3D that comes out.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|This is the story of a young adolescent boy who was born with severe head and facial abnormalities.The story follows him during his first experience in school during early adolescence (he hwas homeschooled earlier) The author shows in depth insight and understanding of the reactions of the other students both positive and negative. The reader avidly follows the main chacter through his travails and succdeses. I think this is an important book for teenagers and for parents. Clearly I recommend it.<br />  Cece
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I love the graphics and control options. I look forward to enjoying many hours playing with it. thanks for everything.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This is an interesting mystery about the disappeance and possible murder  of a wife on the the fifth anniversary of her marriage. The book shifts back and forth between the husband  telling his story and the wife doing the same. The book held my interest for the most part but it began to be predictable.<br />  It is an unusual approach and well written .  I think most readers will enjoy it.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie with my daughter.  It's indulging to the imagination of a child.  My daughter is 9 and she sat through it and was in awe.
044042335X|1.0|Possibly the most boring writer I've ever read! After the initial murder, absolutely nothing happens. The author just plods along, like a zombie. I thought I'd give this author a second chance, after being disappointed with Gone Tomorrow, considering all the positive reviews he gets. Big mistake! This guy couldn't write an action thriller to save his wife's life! Anyone looking for a good action yarn should stay away from this old lady. His books are as exciting as watching paint dry.<br /> I think I'll stick with Cussler, Thor, Rollins, and other true thriller writers. I'm done with this guy.
1863514260|5.0|If you need help with color coordinating or matching colors of threads in a project, this is the book for you!  You will not have a problem with colors again.  I hated to look for colors for a project, but this book solves the problem!  You will LOVE this book!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Excellent! Great story & special effects. The animals looked so real & it left you wondering if it really happened.
034580404X|5.0|The book is very well written, once I picked it up it was hard to put down. It is an attention getter and keeper for sure.
B004132HZS|5.0|This is the most brilliantly written and acted TV show that I have ever seen! I loved what Steven Moffat did with Doctor Who so I wanted to see his spin on Sherlock. Outstanding! If only American TV could be written so well.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|well I would give it 5 stars but you need wifi. seriously what if you play it on the road and there is no wifi that is just retarted.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|This was the &#34;Best of&#34; album that Whitney Houston's songs were on.  This is one of my favorite albums and I am glad that I bought it.  It sure brings a lot of memories.
B007SGM084|4.0|I gave this book a 4 star raing because I really enjoyed the read. I loved the way the book flowed and the magnetic pull Anna and Christian had. Try as you might you can't beat true love.
B00BGZ8OLA|4.0|This movie requires more than one viewing .  The visuals are stunning.  I can why it received so many Oscar nominations.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's not quite like the one I play on my Ipad which allows me to win more often.  But, I deal with it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is a must~ see show. Take the time to try & see this show and all its past seasons . Not to be missed.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I ordered this book by mistake shortly after I got my first Kindle, yet I decided to read it, instead of turning it back to Amazon. The description of this book was not a book I would have ordered. The Fault in Our Stars was written, I believe, for a younger reader, possibly in their teens or even older. Yet, I now believe it is a book for young and old. What inspiration! It is about a teen age girl who has had terminal cancer for as long as she remembers, she has been, &#34;terminally ill.&#34; This book made me laugh, cry, and a heart feeling good. I highly recommend this book for people over 12 years old up to 112 years old.<br /><br />Marci L
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game.  I play it every day on my Kindle.  I love that I can move things around and that I really do not have to buy anything to play it. My grandson, which is three years old, loves tapping on the coins for me and seeing all the different animals.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|i think my 6 yr old grand daughter has renewed belief now... lol.  cute movie and even entertained me for the entire movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The zombies take a back seat to a real human thriller.  It explores all the facets of human behavior under extreme circumstances and pressure.  The zombies are more like part of the background setting as the show investigates the dynamics of human behavior.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|Season 1 was a very good start to TNG. Those episodes were very much in the style of TOS episodes. However, season 2 is when they started to grow and mature into their own series. Elementary, Dear Data, Q Who?, and Measure of a Man all come in as welcome episodes as TNG established itself as its own entity.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|This guy never makes a bad movie, I love everything he does, so attractive and sexy. I'd love to give him a review....lol.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie didn't have a bunch of fancy gadgets.  But it didn't need any of that to be a Bond film. The story was well done, and the ending comes as a surprise to what you may expect. By the time the credits roll at the end of the movie, it feels as if the entire series has done a 360, with the next movie being expected to be more in line with the original Bond films of the 60s.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I love this movie, lot's of action, and adventure, even a happy ending. Who could ask for more? Love it !
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a good way to stay connected to family and friends. It keeps you connected on what is going on.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Pretty decent keyboard. Not perfect but it's much better than most other options. Hopefully they keep working on it because some of the predictions sucks
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My son loves playing this game. He plays when he is in the van or at appointments. Some races are hard but if they didn't get hard then you won't be excerising your brain.
B00BESLHEA|4.0|While this is not the very best movie I have ever seen it is a quite decent Kung Fu film. It has an old style Kung Fu feel with some modern special effects. I think for a rapper RZA did a fine job over all with this movie.
B00B935SUY|4.0|The first hour of Sound City is downright inspiring.<br /><br />The way it takes you through the history of a place which birthed some of the greatest pop music of the 20th century and provides insight in to the creative process of all these musical geniuses is what makes Sound City great.<br /><br />The last half hour of the movie is Dave Grohl making some songs, which is neat but ultimately a bit dull.<br /><br />Highly recommend that first hour for anyone who likes rock music -- aka anyone -- or anyone trying to create something. I found it inspiring, Sound City might not take you that far but at a minimum you should wind up entertained.
B005PK553C|5.0|Its a miniseries about a small family in a newly purchased haunted house, in which they become entangled with the spirits which reside in the house.  Each episode tells a messed up story about the inhabitants and further family entanglement ensues.  Very good, Very dark.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a fast-paced game that challenges one's reflexes. If you like to play against your own score....or against that of a friend, you can easily &#34;wear out&#34; your nerves.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|Average kids/family Hollywood film involving time travel  I enjoyed number one better but this film certainly did not disappoint as a one time viewing.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Graphics are spectacular, amusing storyline, and game play is challenging but not impossible, but best of all is it is replayable without boredom setting in. Well worth the price.
B007KOMTUI|4.0|Story line is about the 60s new york advertising business and the fictional egotistical rich white men involved in it.  The characters all have an impressive wardrobe and and amazing continuity of a 60s theme.  Lots of drama and chain smoking and drinking.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Surprised many times over during this movie.  Hard to believe it is a true story.  Kept my attention throughout. Wonderful!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Glad to see a book that was fun to read, but dealt with mental illness.  Wish the movie had stuck with the story line instead of turning it into a sappy love story.
B00AH69MS8|5.0|I think I was 14 years old when I bought this new on cassette. Over the years, there's never been a time when it wasn't one of my top 5 favorite and most listened to albums. I've never been able to decide if this or Ride the Lightening is the better album but together they're some of the best music ever!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|One of the most interesting games I've played.  It's fun and can become really challenging as you progress through the levels.  I've had no problems with it playing on My LG Optimus G.
B000ZK4466|4.0|This album is really great, and leans toward a harder spectrum in their progressive rock.  The lyrics and music are reminiscent of what the title says, and that's bedlam.  Another amazing album by The Mars Volta
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really cool it's like your hanging out with a real horse!  If you like horses you have to get this!
B00009V7T2|5.0|De-Loused in the Comatorium is perhaps my favorite in The Mars Volta's collection.  It's extremely eclectic and mixes so many genres.  It is the epitome of progressive/experimental rock.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|Great product, works very well.  Have used in very cold weather and the mount works very well.  Takes great videos!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Makes me wish that I could have read the first book before this one. It won't stop me from reading the next book
B005FITIGO|5.0|It takes an Independent writer-director like John Chandor to nail the financial buggery of Wall Street that all others - especially the big film companies - have danced around. It is without doubt the best film on Wall Street ever made. I know. For five long years I had to work with those men and women. I saw it, in close up. Chandor's brilliant script is accurate and fearless; small wonder it attracted a brilliant cast, every one of whom contributed a brilliant performance. It is a film you will want to buy to show to your children and your grandchildren. For the morally constipated machinations of Wall Street are not new, the crises they spawn are not new, and they will continue as long as greed is the goal of all who work in Wall Street and its comparable financial markets around the entire world.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi Picoult again has wrote a great book- between this and Nineteen minutes I'm not sure which is my favorite. No matter what the subject she puts such great detail, I cry every time! Great read! Enjoy.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I ended up removing this.  I had no idea you have to play this on face book, no other option.  Since I don't have an account with face book and have no intentions of having an account - out it goes.  Is there just a plain ol bingo game out there?
B00ANW33CM|5.0|This game is not as easy as it looks, really challenging with the different rotation of the cubes, graphics are great.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome and fun to play. When I got it I thought that I would not enjoy it but when I started to play, I really had fun
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I really enjoy playing the game.  Only wish that there were move levels to play.  Great graphics, and good sound
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I absolutely love this Patrick Rothfuss. His writing style and skill is well worth waiting for in between his books!
B0050XFY4O|5.0|This movie definately hit home for me, no Im not in-love with my brother, but this story is my life.
B002PEP4EG|4.0|I throughly enjoyed this book.  There is nothing secret on the methods justed in the book it is the matter of pulling all of the elements together in a cohesive fashion that is the gem of this book.
B004SUDPWI|3.0|First class production that stands up remarkably well for its age. Solid story and performances, but it falls short of David Lean's masterpiece - Lawrence of Arabia - which hit the screens just five years later. You can certainly see telltale signs of Lean's early genius.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A<br /><br />Great to he point told it like it is. /was, no BS Just plain god ole boy from Texas who told his side with feelings. God Rest his sole. . I would. Recommend this to every one.<br /><br />L Erickson USN Vietnam  Vet<br /><br /> vet
B0057UA486|2.0|A stunning-looking film, wonderfully captured on blu-ray. Kubrick has captured the era perhaps better than any other period piece, but like many of his films, it is a bit soulless and it is hard to generate any real interest in or concern for the characters. And it is looooong - almost like watching the 18th Century in real time.
B008CJ0JTI|5.0|This is my first Criterion movie and I am very impressed with the effort the put into it. All the extras, movie book insert and even the box presentation. The movie comes in a clear case instead of your tipical bluray case (I'm assuming its to define the criterion collection from your own bluray collection. This is the reason I buy blank bluray cases. I loved this movie to begin with... It was great to see Criterion did as well.
B00AEFXN46|5.0|Great story, fabulous characters. That Nicholson swagger and the 1930s suits are unforgettable. The whole thing looks brilliant - particularly on blu-ray, which really captures the vision Polanski intended.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I knew I was going to love this movie. It had some great humorous parts, the storyline was good, sometimes made you want to cry and think, but overall it was just a great movie to enjoy. I will be re-watching it or buying it to own. This is one of those movies you want to own in your movie collections.
B009A87ZKG|5.0|Absolutely outstanding film. George C Scott provides one of the all-time great screen performances in a role that captures a man falling victim to his own ego. The blu-ray version really gives it scale and brings it to life. And the detail is phenomenal: in the opening sequence, watch for the extreme close-up of Scott speaking to his troops - you can see the make-up eyebrows stuck over his own.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|Love the series and am sorry to hear it's not going to continue.  Its a good show and will be missed!
B009K0P10K|5.0|Love the many twists and turns in this show. I look forward eagerly to watching each and every new episode.
098555780X|5.0|This book is a must have for someone getting into tying lanyards and wrist bracelets.  It takes you step by step and is fully illustrated.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This show has it all in spades, plus I'd love to have Alicia's wardrobe! My husband and I are both hooked and he's not easily entertained with TV.
B00328G4XE|5.0|I was so happy when I got this CD. I absolutely love the music on here. Machine gun is the bomb!!! Love Love Love it! I would also like to own the other one! Band of Gypsies for ever!
B007M45PMU|3.0|Some nice listening but it feels too short, leaving me with a &#34;Huh?&#34; What's the fuss? If you have a couple of tunes you like, then buy them separately as the album won't add much more.
B000GCFO0S|5.0|Finally! Silent Hill on Bluray. This is the way it was really meant to be viewed, in all its high-definition terror.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Good acting but it needed a lot of editing. What should have been fascinating turned out to be very boring...
B00881VLCE|4.0|The adds make hard to get pieces without opening adds! Otherwise fun app. Maybe this was planned to make you buy app to remove adds- not fair and sucks!
0307352153|5.0|This book clarifies the major and also subtle differences between extroverted and introverted persons.  This book described and validated so many people I know, including myself.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The best movie I saw last year and the Blu-ray video is great... highly recommended to those considering purchasing it. You won't be disappointed...
B009X01C64|5.0|Arrived quickly in excellent condition.  Fits my Kindle Fire 8.9 perfectly.  Like the feel of it.  Would recommend to anyone.
0060557818|5.0|Book arrived just as described. It was a quick process and ship. Item was exactly what I wanted.  Neil Gaiman is an excellent writer.
