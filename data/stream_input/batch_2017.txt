B008LSVLVA|5.0|Afortunadamente adem&aacute;s del recuerdo personal del concierto en Caracas - Venezuela, queda el registro de audio y video del concierto en M&eacute;xico que incluye im&aacute;genes de esta gira por Latinoam&eacute;rica como material extra, son 2CD/1DVD/1Blue-ray. De quien es en la opini&oacute;n de muchos un genio de la m&uacute;sica, para m&iacute; sin lugar a dudas el m&uacute;sico m&aacute;s importante de comienzos del siglo XXI.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|I thought he retired from acting from Gran Torino but like Sean Connery Never say never again He did it again. Grumpy old man and I loved the movie and Amy Adams. Enjoy it.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Well done--great acting, entertaining story line and I love the historical context, especially given the change occurring in that point in history.
B00338QENI|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot<br /><br />\\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" is the fantastic best-selling book about the woman from whom the scientifically essential HeLA cell were taken from.  It's a ten-year quest to find out about the life of Henrietta Lacks and its legacy.  In reality this book turned out to be about three people: Henrietta Lacks, Deborah Lacks and yes even though it wasn't her intentions, the author, Rebecca Skloot.  In many respects it's a great literary accomplishment; this book covers many layers of interest:  science, race, social injustice, poverty, medical ethics, journalism, and faith in one remarkable narrative.  This notable 400-page book is broken out into thirty-eight chapters and broken into the following  three parts: 1. Life, 2. Death, and 3. Immortality.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. A great overall literary achievement. A very readable account of the life of Henrietta Lacks and her impact to science. It's an authentic real-life story in which the author herself out of necessity became part of the story.<br />2. A high-quality book.  Well-researched, well-written book.  Skloot's dedication to this quest is commendable.<br />3. Rebecca Skloot handles all the sensitive multiple topics with the utmost care and respect.  It's that care, knowledge and drive that helped her gain the kind of access behind the success of this authentic book.<br />4. Fair and even handed. The book can be emotional at times but through it all (except for one interesting episode which I will not spoil) the author keeps it together.<br />5. You care about the people in this book.  You care about the Lacks family and you wish them all well. Much of the success of the book can be attributed to that one fact.<br />6. Great format!  The author provides everything a good book should have:  a Timeline, Cast of Characters, a Where They Are Now section, and an excellent Afterword, and last but not least a great book club guide!<br />7. A well layered book full of interesting topics driven by the main topic of Henrietta Lacks' life.  Many fascinating topics that come as a result of the quest to obtain details of Henrietta Lacks' life: science, race, social injustice, poverty, medical ethics, journalism, and faith.<br />8. This book turns out to be about three people:  Henrietta Lacks the main driver behind this book; Deborah Lacks the daughter who wants to know more about the mother she barely knew; and it's about the young author who is on a quest and makes sacrifices of her own that results in this fantastic book.<br />9. A very accessible book.  The science that is here is very basic and understandable.  People who are reluctant to read this book because they fear the science involved should not be.  One of the more important and underrated science-related topics covered is that of medical ethics.  Ethics involving the use of tissues, consent forms, right to privacy, who should benefit financially...<br />10. The book will inspire you to learn more about some of the topics introduced.  I found myself reading more about the great life of John Hopkins.  There is bound to be a topic introduced in this book that will motivate you to learn more about it.<br />11. One of the topics that will strike particularly younger readers is race relations in the 50s.  Some of the racist practices of the past is still shocking today. Poverty is also a very important and recurring theme.<br />12. The author does a great job of following the lives of Henrietta Lacks' children.  And an excellent \\"Where They Are Now\\" section guarantees no loose ties.<br />13. You will learn about HeLa cells (short for Henrietta Lacks), the code name given to immortal human cells that were an essential part of the research into the genes that cause cancer.  You will understand their importance for humanity. The chapter titled \\"HeLa Factory\\" does a fantastic job of providing some sound scientific information.  Scientific challenges.<br/>14. Capturing the essence of the Lacks family in plain language.  \\"We all mixed. And one of my mother sisters converted to Puerto Rican.\\"  As a Puerto Rican and a fellow human being we are in fact all connected...<br />15. The issue of financial exploitation is manifested in different ways in this book.<br />16. Issues of mistrust with the establishment.<br />17. Excellent notes section.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. My biggest gripe of the book is that the final third part drags and lacks the punch that the first two thirds had.  It's never a good sign when I find myself checking how much longer I needed to read to finish the book.  That being said, the wonderful more \\"meaty\\" afterward did wonders for me.<br />2. It's not a science-heavy book for those among us who prefer non-fiction.<br />3. The book spends IMHO too much time on Deborah Lacks.<br />4. There is still a part of me bothered by the notion that the Lacks family hasn't really benefitted financially from the awareness made from this book.  I'm not blaming the author, as far as was reported by this book she has helped establish an educational foundation for their children but I would love to see John Hopkins or any of the companies that benefitted immensely from the HeLa cells step forward and at the very least provide free medical care for the family.<br /><br />In summary, what a fantastic literary achievement.  Rebecca Skloot has received many accolades for this book and deservedly so.  Dare I say, this book went viral but in a good way.  The story of Henrietta Lacks has captivated many readers and we can thank the author's dedication, patience, and the commitment to take on such a big risk.  It's a gamble that resulted in an extraordinary story, a human story.  I highly recommend it!<br /><br />Further suggestions: \\"[[ASIN:B003UYUP58 The Emperor of All Maladies]]\\" by Siddhartha Mukherjee, \\"[[ASIN:B008H1SIVM The Violinist's Thumb]]\\" by Sam Kean, \\"[[ASIN:1591025648 Relics of Eden: The Powerful Evidence of Evolution in Human DNA]]\\" Daniel J.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|His books are becoming repetitious.  This one was better that the last couple.  I probably won't buy another of his books.  That is why I agave it an average.
B0085LGL5E|5.0|Rock and roll is still alive thanks to the Hives. Only one slow song in the bunch. Great lyrics and catchy licks. Buy this and support the cause!
B0078XFYDA|4.0|Richard Dawkins is a genius.  This is good coverage for people looking for good basic treatment on why being a sceptic makes more sense than believing in &#34;magic&#34;.
B0051GOB26|5.0|Came in great condition, looked like new. Would recommend this purchase to others and if you like this I'd recommend the book the dude and the Zen master.

B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I love it.  It works very well with my computer and my programs.  I especially need it for my business.
B004HD61KE|3.0|The book implies you will learn some secrets of the founding of america when it is nothing but fiction. I really wanted more fact,and less fiction.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Just finished reading this book and I know many people are criticizing it but I really enjoyed it. I fell in love with all the characters. The only thing is I feel at the end of the book the author was in a rush to finish the story.
1451695195|5.0|With so much negatives about religion the author brings back to the front of why we were born and where we hope to go when our life here is over.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|While he comes to the point of the stories quickly, I felt that Sanderson unfortunately did not develop the story slowly enough. I was able to finish the short story within a day or two of reading. The chapters are usually ten pages or less. It seemed that he rushed to the end of each story snapshot and while he did provide a great amount of detail in that short period, a more enjoyable work would have allowed more expression of the setting in which he places the story.<br /><br />I would read another of his stories but if they continue to develop too quickly, as this did, my appreciation of the author could suffer.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Awesome game totally addictive and a great time.  It is really fun and hard to put down. This is very awesome
B006R1T40I|5.0|Like a fine wine, Bonnie just gets better with age. There should be more hype for this album, it's perfect. There is one problem with I have listening to this one. Tract #7, &#34;Not Because I Wanted To&#34; , makes me cry EVERYTIME I listen to it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a captivating book from start to finish. A great read from beginning to end and you wont want to put the book down.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I have been using this app on my kindle fire for a couple of months and find that I have grown to like it! I like the way it informs me when the kindle is fully charged,and when the charge drops to a percentage I preset. on my last fire it calibrated fast and easy, however, I have not had the same luck on my fire hd.<br /> overall, you just can' t beat the price (free).
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is truly inspiring. It captures your attention an  you can't put it down. I can't wait to see the movie!
B0086700CM|4.0|I really do enjoy this game it is fun and addictive. I just wish the weird things that chase you didn't look so creepy!
B004I9G486|5.0|I bought this specifically to add A2DP support to my 2010 A4 (a glaring omission, if you ask me). I needed to splice some wires & a resistor in, so I didn't want to buy the $80 one from the dealer. I can say this one has worked just fine for a couple of months after modification.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|Took this off my kindle. Did not want gkids charging money to my account to play this game on my kindle hd.  Looks like would be fun otherwise.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|I enjoyed this collection of short stories very much. The stories drew me in from the first sentence. Great character development.
B004H83IM8|5.0|great price for a hillarious trilogy.  got these for my son to watch on a long road trip.  he was cackling the whole way.  perfect 13 year old humor.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a great vacation read with some thrill.  It was a quick read and I could not put the book down until I finished.
B008B8A9V8|5.0|I love having this book on my tablet because it lets me look up information when I need it.  I have used several of the tips and techniques already and am so glad I bought this book.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|i wanted to like it, but it was just ok. fun special effects, but why the hannibal lecter/darth vader mask?? nice setup for the next installment.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|these peels are great!  I let my daughter put them on and they look very cute. it was a good project for us to do together and we both had a lot of fun.  go some diamond looking stickers to add interest & sparkle to the stickers and they look awesome!
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|The whole premiss of the movie is that the mob can't kill people in the future and must send them 30 years into the past to have them killed by Loopers.  However, future Looper (Bruce Willis) comes back to kill the head of the Mob as a child because his wife was murdered by the mob in the future.  So if the mob can kill his wife in the future, then it throws the whole idea of needing Loopers out.  This seemly simple plot error, ruined the whole movie.
0743216458|5.0|Band of Brothers is worth the read.  WWII works like this and The White Pocketbook recently written by Walter Bannon, are Amazons two best books on WWII experiences that are so touching and real!!!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|the movie starts out slow and only towards the end is it exciting,. The ending is def not what I expected considering all the other Bourne movies have to say was a bit disappointing :(
B005LAII62|3.0|My kids got a kick out of this movie and it kept them entertained for the duration of the movie. For me...eh, not so much. I was looking forward to the scene between Norman and the frog in a jar and it wasn't in the movie. I know that sounds silly, but it was one of my favorite parts of the book and so to not have it in there was a let down. The graphics were good and there were a few parts that actually roused a laugh from me, but for the most part, I thought the movie was only half as good as the book was. The kids wanted to watch it again, so for them it was a good experience, but I just didn't love it as much as I had hoped I would. It wasn't awful, I just thought it could have been better.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Starts well but ends suddenly and there its let's that the author just let's go in mid air of an idea.
B005LAIISA|4.0|I watched this movie with my kids yesterday and I was somewhat surprised that we laughed all the way through it. Unlike the last few Ice Age movies, it seems the writers actually remembered what made these movies so great in the first place. I thought the introduction of teenaged-drama with Peaches was a nice way to go with the storyline as it broke up the monotony. How anyone can watch this movie and not fall head over heels in love with Granny would be beyond me. She was our favorite part of the movie for sure.<br /><br />As always, the animation was great and I was pleased to see that Scrat had some pretty good screen time. Overall We found this movie to be a worthwhile addition to our collection. Great family entertainment.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I play it more then the kids!!!  have fun making the ponies dance ;) wish 'expanding ' didn't go up everytime you got more.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I bought this book for my teenage son and decided to read it as well. I loved it and would recommend this to anyone looking for a quick easy read.
B008RZF2I0|5.0|I was worried when I heard that the phenomenal voice of Kamelot had left, but this album is great. The songs are true Kamelot quality, and Tommy Karevik does an awesome job at the helm. I've listened to the album over and over for several weeks and don't get tired of it. Highly recommended!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It has good graphics and is fun for animal lover's.you'll love it is the best.it has compititions, stable cleaning, and you even get to share with friends the wonderful things of my horse.you can name your horse.I give it 5 stars!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|LOVE this app!  My husband and I both use it everyday! It is great that it gives you an audio option.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughter loves playing this game.  She likes to see her favorite ponies from the show.  She would give it 10 stars if she could.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, commonly known as Mormons. We believe we all lived as a spirit in the Spirit World before we came to this earth. Dr. Alexander said when he was in the other world, he had knowledge that he had returned, which was a confirmation of my church teachings that we had existed before this life. He also said that God looked like us, which is also a confirmation of my church belief that we are literally created in His image and that God has a body that looks like ours except that it perfected and glorified. Someday we will gain such a body through a resurrection, which is made possible by Christ. I believe his NDE to be true and real.

B009VL299E|5.0|Great DVD for any MetallicA fan!! I went to the Chicago shows for this tour, and it was great to relive it again watching this DVD!
0812993357|5.0|If you are a follower of the fashion industry, you have to read this book.<br />And, if you have been around long enough to remember the 60's fashion<br />expolsion, you will be more than delighted with Grace's memoir.<br /><br />She traces her life from a childhood of modest beginnings to her present-<br />day life. Her in-depth tales are vivid and intimate. I truly felt as though<br />I were there with her. Grace talks candidly about her personal life - her<br />loves, marriages, and friendships. She tells of her life as a model, as well<br />as the party scene during that time. Grace walks through her transitions from<br />working at British Vogue to Calvin Klein to American Vogue. She names names and<br />gives very personal accounts of her impressions/relationships with each person.<br />(This includes rock personalities, models, celebrities, designers, Anna, and more.)<br /><br />Her down-to-earth style will speak to your heart. Her illustrations are dear,<br />as is her love of her cats. The photos are excellent. I highly recommend this<br />book.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|Gone tomorrow is the third Jack Reacher story I have read so far and I was not disapointed.<br />Reacher is the best of John Rambo, Dirty Harry and Sherlock Holmes but he makes a very credible character.<br />The plot is linear but it is hard to guess what is coming, it surprises you with every twist and turn.<br />I kept on turning the pages for a whole Saturday and in the end I had to refrain myself from buying another one of Lee Child's books.<br />For fans or new adopters, there is a lot of fun inside.
B003O86FMW|5.0|So big f2f box. F2f. F2f. Txt c.f. c.f.  n bc c. F2f xxx b uhh f. H high ugh
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book really held my attention. Strong characters and a plot that twists and turns until the end, I couldn't put it down.
B0086700CM|1.0|The iphone has it so why cant the kindle fire!? If you agree than post your review! I vote upgrade!
B005SMGRH0|4.0|So I thought this was really cool. Video's etc. Price was great. Some of the live stuff just seemed like filler material but it was interesting to see how they would do a live performance with an animated band.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Great first novel in the Jack Reacher series. A true crime fighting story - great suspense!<br />Loved it
B002Y7HGDQ|5.0|Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Blah blah blah blah, blah blah blah. Blah blah blah... Blah blah blah. I am a big fan of this show/movie.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Works without skipping and no scratches.  Would recommend this purchase for any one.  The rating is the pitts as I don't like being told how many words!!!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Wonderfully written. A quick read, easy to follow. The whole concept of time and how it started was food for thought.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The kids and I love playing this game. I guess it's similar to Farmville and Frontierville, only with characters and a setting from the Ice Age films. There are cute mini cut scenes, and even trailers from the movies that you can watch at the movie theater. Haven't figured out how to add Facebook friends yet though.
B009E3EXMU|4.0|The live show was totally awesome.  I was disapointed that the bonus disk didn't have more of the band talking, hanging out and planning the show etc.  It was mostly rehersal at the same venue as the live concert.  The music CD and Concert DVD was worht the money though.  I sure wish I could see them live for myself but this is the next best thing.
B0000541B2|5.0|Been working with PS 2 for online game that is not available on PS3. Badly needed the controller replacement! Sony original so quality is there! Received quickly.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I thought I had this book all figured out until the very end. It will shock and surprise you while giving you empathy for our heroine.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am enjoying this app so much that I am addicted to playing it at night when I should be going to bed. I find that I have to get a win or I want to keep playing. It is fun and easy to use. Love it.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|What can I say? Gillian Flynn is a master writer who takes you into the story and doesn't let go until the very end.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I bought the first season because it was so cheap at a store on black friday.I never watched the series before,only read the books.I got hooked,had to buy the other seasons.Its a good show,it doesnt follow the storyline in the books so youre surprised with the way things evolve.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A true masterpiece of a parent's love and how that love can sometimes blind. Kept me guessing right up to the very end.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Its very easy to get hooked on this series.It doesnt follow the books so you never know what to expect.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoy a good story with great acting, good production values and this series delivers. Leave it to the Brits and PBS to bring a true &#34;Masterpiece&#34;.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Realt a great show in HD!<br />Picture and sound is great.<br />I think $5 for HD is an ok price<br />I don't buy DVDs so this is a good way to go furor folks like me:)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I made myself read the whole book, though I was thoroughly disappointed by the end of Chapter 1.  I'm not sure why this book has become the first &#34;mainstream&#34; sex novel... The writing is pathetic.  Aside from her vast knowledge of all things sexual, James seems to have the vocabulary of a typical 12-year-old.  If a person is looking for a pornographic novel, surely there must be some that are better written.
B004A8EI9M|2.0|I just finished the first season, and I can't believe it is being so heavily praised.  When I watch a series like Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones, the characters, writing, and story line are so good and feel so real that I cannot wait to start the next episode.  This is the opposite.  Each episode is worse than the one before it.  The writing is so bad and the characters actions seem so forced and contrived, that I find this nearly unwatchable.  The characters are all like cardboard and have no personality.  The african american woman in the group has about 2 lines the whole series.  The blonde girl just gives us lame \\"worried\\" faces, and the \\"hill billy\\" dude is so stereotyped that it is comical.  Even the main characters are lame, and their kid has the personality of a stuffed animal.  The zombies are also pathetic; just bopping around town on the streets.  You'd have to be blind and crippled to get caught by one.<br /><br />So tell me, does the show get dramatically better in subsequent seasons?  After watching season 1, I am really baffled.  How can people rate this as a 5 star show?
B005LAII8K|4.0|Good movie keeps you thinking throughout the whole movie. It did take a little longer than I thought to get here.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game has an interesting storyline and is fun to play. The graphics are pretty good and there are mini games that can be tricky.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|I bought as a gift for my sister. We both love the movie because we have read the books. ads
B002VECM6S|5.0|I really love this movie an have watched it several times. Great modern story. Shipped in a decent time frame. Thanks, Debbie
B004QL7K70|3.0|Good movie not as good as i thought it would be but it was still something different and new. ;la
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Brilliantly written.  I didn't want to stop reading.  The story line never dragged, and yo could feel all the emotions of the characters.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I give a four because it was a great sequel to The Son Of Neptune. I didn't give 5 stars because a little too much detail. Good books Rick Riordan. GO RICK RIORDAN!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Having read almost all of the Tom Clancy/other writers works I found this book to be very hard to put down. The story is just scary enough to be true.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|A great time waster. Good clean fun, if you don't like swine. Help the birds get the eggs back. Fun
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|Is what I thought, hours of fun! Pain in my bottom from sitting so long, teary watery eyes from starring so long..memories.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Obviously a novel work of genius. The idea for the plot and the way it develops are both phenomenal. You'll love it unless you're overly critical.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|This movie is so cute.  I watched even without the grandkids!  The message that one can persevere even if the underdog is great.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|All in one place...full unedited versions of seasons one and two...all the &#34;extras&#34; and a jaw dropping video and audio transfer of the series in blu-ray.  Without question, the definitive version of the first two seasons of one of the most addicting and engaging television series ever....the highest recommendation possible!
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|This is an OK movie for adults.  I watched it the one time but will not have it in my collection.  Not worth seeing more than once.
1449415881|5.0|Couldn't get through the year without it!<br />Day after day, year after year it's the best with a touch of twisted reality.
B006TJXZ30|3.0|While I like Hotmail on my PC, I don't really care for it on my Kindle Fire HD.  It loads fine and pops right up.  However, it is rather difficult to browse.  I could not find a way to 'sign out,' thus the email inbox was always open.  Anyone walking by had access.<br />If I am away from home with my Kindle, I will get on the web & access my email from there instead of having Hot mail loaded directly onto the Kindle.
B008UFUOH6|5.0|This cd is great music for the holiday season--captures the joy and the wistful nature.  Because of the dark, we see the joy in the spark!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is probably the best book I have  ever read. When I normally read a book it always  seems that the main character always has the same perspective in every book. But when I read this book something a bout how the main character, Charlie looks at like it was a whole different perspective that kept pulled into the book. Definatley a must read.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I read the book a few years ago and when I learned that the movie was coming out, I had to purchase it again because I had given my first copy away.  I read it again before the movie came out--then saw the movie.  I loved the movie but the book is so much better.  I recommend it highly!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this app it never freezes and its as if you are actually are taking  care of a horse
B004FXG29Q|5.0|This is my first major Schubert purchase.  I'm am very pleased with the amount of music, quality and price.  I will have to look into more by Brendal too.
B005EHQGTS|1.0|Do not get this app if your screen is 8.9.  I should have read the other reviews about the screen size.
0062183591|5.0|It's an excellent book, simple great... Dan Ariely raise the bar... he show us some reason that explain why we are dishonest.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I played this game so long I went cross-eyed. totally addictive and unlike most Glu games you can actually earn a fair amount of coins, etc.
B001NU4CDM|5.0|I have seen the band five times.  the older albums have the better songs with melodic tunes and great lyrics
0452289963|5.0|This book was recommended to me by two people and now I have recommended it to others.  Whatever your religion or philosophy this book's essential message is one that every person needs to wake up to.  It immediately has an effect which is cool because it is about the present moment and when I find I am falling off track I read it again.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I have Alien on VHS laser disc (criterion) DVD and now the blu ray - this is a perfect set
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|This is actually my first T.I. album purchased, in the past I never had more than just 1-2 of T.I.'s songs that I personally enjoyed so didn't see it necessary to purchase his entire album. I actually listened to this album with a friend who had recently purchased and was BLOWN AWAY! The tracks in this album are POWERFULLY strong, they're also smooth and have such indepth hard hitting impact on ones mind, that I couldn't wait to purchase! If you've never been a T.I. fan in the past this album is sure to change your mind!
B0085RQLXK|5.0|40 years on the road and still making rock n roll! Im a hardcore fan, MFAD is a good album, not Aerosmith's best job, but waaaay better than JPP and some other works. Still would have loved to hear more songs like Street Jesus, too much ballads. But overall is one of the best actual works out there from this year. Not disappointed at all, and I recommend the album to everybody. It has a taste of every Aerosmith era. Cant wait for what's yet to come!
B008KW43TE|5.0|I never knew who Frank Ocean was until maybe 2 months ago. This album is unique, and interesting. I am not unhappy that I made this purchase.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Fun and challenging.  Really enjoyed playing it. Cute, too.  Can't wait for more levels because it is kind of addicting to get all the best scores.
B00A17AD36|5.0|I had never heard of this artist until I listened to a Wiz Khalifa track 'Remember you' I thought it was Frank Ocean voice I was hearing until I saw the actual video credits. The Weeknd's voice is VELVETY smooth and sexy. I don't think his album was promoted well and that's a shame!
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|ap connected straight to my 360 from my samsung proclaim as i dont have a smart tv. unfortunatly the 360 cant play videos in .gp format but will play .mp4. the pi tures an videis looked great on my tv. ive already recommended this ap to a few of my friends.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This was a wonderfully funny movie with loveable characters and a nice plot line. It's nice to see a strong Disney Princess who knows her mind and fights for what she believes in but still humble enough to learn the lesson at the end of the film.
B000T45CDM|5.0|Al Pacino & Johnny Depp made an awesome team, there wit, charisma & tough guy attitude made the movie cant wait for the longer version to be made available for instant streaming through amazon super good movie with a good cast.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|This is my second Behringer mixer...needed this one to be lighter and more portable, thus the reason I chose this particular model.  Quality construction!

B001RNO7D0|5.0|I love the shoe, the comfort, the looks and everything about this shoe except for one thing...some of the stitching starts to come out after a bit of wear.  The shoe leather,sole and all are still looking new and in great shape, but then some stitching comes out.  I have to take it to a shoe repair to get it restitched.  I have had two pairs of these now and both pairs have had the same problem in the same place on the shoe.  That said I am now on my third pair and love the shoe.  I will continue to buy them as long as they are available.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Beautiful costumes, interesting view of society post war. If there were more programs like this, I'd watch more television. Well worth our time.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|thoroughly enjoyed this book.  would recommend it ti my friends.  was not sure at first if I would enjoy, but it turned out to be a quick page turning experience.
B00AS1Q8FW|2.0|I don't buy Cruise as Reacher. Sorry, but the character's physical size and strength is too much a part of the novels. One of the prime characteristics of Reacher is the intimidation of his opponents by his size. It is a MAJOR character point. It helps make the character believable. As a 6'4\\", 230 pound ex-bouncer in a variety of night clubs, I promise you that in real life, big guys normally win, unlike when Hollywood pays the big guy to fall down when fighting the small actor. In my years of bouncing, I only saw two instances of the little guy winning. In one case, the little guy was a highly trained MMA fighter and only a little smaller than his opponent. In the other, the little guy was an athlete and the big guy was out of shape and had obviously never been in a fight before. That is one reason I personally enjoy the Reacher series. It honestly allows for size actually being a factor, just like in real life. Tiny Tom is not Jack Reacher. EVER! Hope they recast and try again.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham has the twists and turns that keeps you reading. I loved the wrap up at the end...it all works together. A great read!
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|Back in January 2013 knowing pending release of \\"Argo\\", the highly promoted reputed remake of a true story, we could have expected to see release of the earlier more factual TV movie version by CTV Television Network, Canadian Film Development Corporation, Canamedia Productions & Stanley Rubin Productions released in May 1981, distributed by CBS for USA viewing.  That film is titled \\"Escape from Iran: the Canadian Caper\\".<br /><br />Detailed information is available online ImDB for the movie and on Wikipedia for historical facts and participants.<br /><br />Remembering that presentation and the actual history of the event, haunted me in considering viewing Ben Affleck's production. The Oscar award and Affleck's unrepentant foolish statements concerning the story and historical background soured any desire to watch the abominable film.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the CTV film is still not available in any format, except as a book.  The CTV film is worth watching.
0425252868|5.0|A true perspective of how the German and Allied forces were used and depleted without regard. Not all Germans were Nazis, which is a common misperception. In fact, most of the Luftwaffe pilots that were had been forced to join that party. This book explains that humanity existed on both sides, regardless of the self-motivated efforts of inane commanders that all militaries seem to possess. For a true account of just a tiny corner of the war, don't miss this account.<br />H. Miller
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Love this book. I love Greek and Roman mythology. Can not wait till the next book. :) :) :) :)
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Enjoyed every minute of this charming and touching approach to story telling. Reading this book gave me many insights into car racing as well!
B009X010RU|4.0|Update 2/9/13- haven't had this case for a month and price has dropped $10. Not super pleased<br /><br />I have to say I was anxious about ordering this product after reading many, many, many reviews. This Marware Shell is exactly what I wanted for my KindleFire HD 8.9. This does not add much weight or bulk, as I have small hands I didn't want to make my new kindle too cumbersome. Many of the reviews I read prior to purchasing state this was a poor quality product, I do NOT share this opinion. Shell portion is well made, when instructions followed for installation all ports and buttons are accesible. I have had to adjust to the orientation change but do not find it to be an issue. Overall, I would certainly recommend this product for anyone looking to purchase a light but still protective case. My only complaint is the price, I forked out $45 for this item and though I am pleased with it, I do feel like the price is a bit steep. However, it does seem to be in line with most quality KindleFire HD cases for the 8.9 in model.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Dying to Be Me: My Journey from Cancer, to Near Death, to True Healing<br /><br />Riviting! A wonderful reminder to keep a check on my emotions and to allow, allow, allow.<br />I am recommending this boolk to EVERYONE!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|every time I start this game, it freezes. I have had many problems with this.  It wont let the character move and when it does, it moves to the wrong place. I love this game, but now, I am getting very annoyed with it.<br /><br />There is also a problem with touching buildings. Sometimes, I touch a certain building but it thinks I touched another instead.<br /><br />its supposed to be a kindle fire edition but I don't see how because it just wont work on my kindle.<br /><br /> please fix this so I can give it five stars!
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Amusing, Intriguing, Suspensful, Great movie.  Johnny Depp at his best!  I would love to watch this movie more than once.
B0012EM5D8|4.0|This movie was a cute way to show my kids that bees are important to us and we need them. it was fun to watch.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Kept my attention the whole time (which is hard to do). Had a hard time putting it down. Can't wait to start the next book!
0446547573|5.0|This was a great book.  But then Nicholas never disappoints his readers.<br />I am an avid Sparks fan, and prefer to read the book before seeing a<br />movie based on his book.  The books are always better than the movies,<br />but that is true with all books I think.  Nicholas is so good at keeping<br />you hanging and wanting to keep reading to find out how a situation<br />plays out.  I recommend this and all Nicholas Sparks books.<br />However, now that I have a Kindle Fire HD, I will no longer be purchasing<br />the paper version of his books.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|its a good app. When I first open it I had problems with it freezing. but now its running fine
0743486285|4.0|This book isn't written the best, but it really does she the slow descent into addiction and the reasoning an addict can go through to keep their addiction going. Worth a read.
031620157X|5.0|Not only I absolutely loved this book, but the delivery service was flawless. It arrived circa 10 days before it was supposed to, and I could read to my heart's content.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What an amazing story!  I read this an entire book in one night.  I could not force myself to put it down until I found out what happened next.  Great, great book!
B005IQ39AY|2.0|I am known for not playing computer games, but I did get kind of addicted to this game during my first few weeks of owning my first tablet device, a KFHD8.9. Unfortunately it has at least three frustrating bugs. 1.) Sometimes it will say Level Failed even when you have hundreds of balls remaining. 2.) Sometimes it fails to recognize that a level has been cleared and it keeps serving new balls. 3.) Sometimes the next ball fails to appear even though another ball appears in the next ball slot. I haven't found any pattern to these failures, and most times it plays properly. Had I paid for it I'd give it only 1 star (zero if it was allowed). On the positive side, it feels more precise with better physics than some other free bubble games I've tried.<br /><br />Added 2/25/2013: Version 2.21 available free from 1mobile fixes the problems with the older version soold by Amazon, although info in the game says it is v. 1.21.  In any case, version 1.09 available from Amazon today is the buggy version. Increasingly I find Amazon is way behind on updates to games and other apps.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I play Angry Birds daily, what a rush. I love the game. Bring on more Angry Birds. I used my Kindle Fire mostly for book reading until a friend recommend Angry Birds now I am hooked.

B003IEJZUG|4.0|Very good but hard to follow-real? imaginary? symbolism? The movie was great but just as confusing. Well written, I love stories of the Indian lifestyle.
0547564651|3.0|This book makes an unbalanced argument in two ways. First, it claims that if schools could just help students develop non-cognitive skills such as grit, courage, kindness, that would have more impact on eventual success than cognitive skills. In truth it's both/and. You need knowledge AND habits of mind. Paul Tough alludes to this with a couple of stories of students who have learned to focus but don't have the background knowledge to score well on tests, yet keeps coming back to grit as the solution.<br /><br />Second, from my standing as an expert in psychological type, I'm concerned about how the book describes conscientiousness, one of these key non-cognitive skills that relates to the NEO-Pi, or Five-Factor personality model scale for Conscientiousness. This model measures traits, so absence of Conscientiousness is a problem. Solution presented: teach the habits of conscientiousness to those who don't have them.<br /><br />The world of psychological type, popularized through the MBTI, has a very different model. Conscientiousness is highly correlated (you can check the MBTI manual) with what we call having a preference for Judging, or coming to closure. Its psychological opposite is Perceiving, or preferring to stay open to more perceptions. Both are equally valuable ways of being.<br /><br />Tough spends a few sentences admitting that one can be too Conscientious (i.e. OCD) and also that people like Steve Jobs didn't necessarily exhibit this--they are more Open in the model he refers to. That's what we'd call Intuition, in contrast to the down-to-earth Sensing approach to life (check my website for way better information on all of this!!)<br /><br />But here's the deal: Tough is pretty much prescribing Sensing/Judging ways of succeeding. And what we know in the type world is that Intuitive/Perceiving types NEED DIFFERENT STRATEGIES. What works for J's like planning ahead and starting early HAS to take a different form for P's.<br /><br />Tough admits that no school has figured out how to educate all students successfully. We won't figure it out until we acknowledge that these inborn differences have different needs for, and definitions of, success.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Very nice story for everyone but was a child's story originally.A happy ending following a wild life's journey. Nice characters.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The characters sucked me in from the very beginning, but I wasn't prepared for the twist and revaluation towards the middle. So glad I had a long weekend to be able to finish reading it. Not your regular romance novel, it was very real and honest. I loved the deep connection and love they all share.
1423113462|5.0|My granddaughter [11 years old] requested this book for Christmas and was excited to receive it.  She plans to read the rest of the series. Prompt delivery in time to wrap.
B005H5H3LW|5.0|Good movie! I thoroughly enjoyed it. I had heard about many bootlegs out there and would have settled for a less than perfect copy, but was pleased with what I got. It was no bootleg, and though it lacked any special features, well worth the money spent and worth the wait to see it. If you liked Starblazers, you should enjoy this movie.
B0017I1IZA|4.0|Really Good book i love the Stephanie plum series, would recommend reading them all to anyone,well except kids.  Good reading.
B009MF56GC|5.0|A great action film, better than the first one... blood, shots,fights and people dying, all in one movie: THE EXPENDABLES 2.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|I haven't finished it yet, but I can't wait until it get into the car again so that I can begin listening.  The only issue that I am having is that whispersync is not working correctly so that the audible book is syncing with the kindle book.  I am constantly having to catch up one or the other.
1400063515|4.0|Taleb can be tiring and redundant. His premise is one that many have subscribed to, at least to the extent &#34;Black Swan&#34; has entered the everyday language of many people (even if they don't fully understand the term and its origins). I enjoyed the book and was able to over look Taleb's 'personality' and his high opinion of himself.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Goodwin enriches our understanding of perhaps the greatest president by telling his story in the context of his contemporaries, both as his rivals and as his colleagues.  The generosity of his spirit shines through in his dealings with them. The stark comparison between their backgrounds and his further enhances our appreciation of what he made of himself and what he accomplished. His evolving attitudes, particularly on slavery, are dealt with directly, his flaws and inconsistencies not glossed over. All this simply makes him more human and his eventual words and actions more striking.<br /><br />The book is long and packed with detail but imminently readable.  It pulls you along like a good mystery, despite the generally well-known tale. The heart-breaking conclusion becomes clear as an equal tragedy for the South.  The partisans assassinated their best hope for their immediate future as they rejoined the Union.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is just another of Tom Clancy's excellent books.  Can't wait for the next journey with Jack jr.  Excellent reading.
0446614459|3.0|Too much disappointment!<br /><br />In the first 2/3 rds of the book the author sets about developing a convoluted and intriguing plot that had so many twists and turns it all began to border on unbelievable.  After about the third twist I began to think, &#34;Oh come on!&#34;.<br /><br />Then Baldacci spends the rest of the book attempting to unravel the mess he created taking significant leaps of logic in the process.<br /><br />As the story began to wind down...or run out of steam... I felt as if he just threw up his hands and decided to write a screenplay for a very bad movie.  I was certain that at the end someone was going to pull off a rubber mask a la Scooby Doo where we would all gasp is shock.  I wasn't too far off.<br /><br />Two observations - I've not looked into this but it seems he set the stage for additional King-Maxwell tales.  After this I'm not sure I will invest the time to find out if Baldacci is able to pull off a tighter storyline with a plausible ending.  I'll rely heavily on the reviews.<br /><br />Secondly, Baldacci seems to have a need to utilize gratuitous insults to take potshots at characters whose ideology may not be in line with his.  I can't see how this technique developed his characters.  It struck me as unnecessary and causes me to wonder what goes through Baldacci's head as he is writing.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is very adictive. the down side is it's a facebook like game. which means alot of things need to be paid for. but there is a way to get around that part and still get the mane 6. choose how you spend things carefully. but it is a very adictive game. i just got fluttershy! she is soooooo cute! and i didnt spend a dime! the animation is great and you get to play and interact with them! so keep calm and flutter on. BROHOOVE!
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Afer seeing the movie, had to buy the CD, and was very pleased with both  I love the music excellent
B007BVOEPI|2.0|I was excited about this series, but after watching it; it seems much more like a period or Medieval soap opera.  There's a lot of geopolitical posturing and who's sleeping with who, but no magic, unique creatures or fantastic elements that make well, fantasy.  In fact, I've read in many reviews that magical or fantasy elements don't even really come into play until the beginning of Season 3.  I'm also concerned, as I've been told to NOT get attached to any character, as no one is safe good characters are regularly and sometimes, arbitrarily killed off.  To get through any epic, I need someone I can invest emotionally in to go the distance.  Can you imagine Lord of the Rings, if you had taken the journey with Frodo over three years and three 3-hour films only to have him killed by an orc at the 11th hour and Sauron reign supreme?  I'd feel manipulated and cheated.  It's not that I need a happy ending to everything.  That's different.  I just need some sort of pay off and it seems like Game of Thrones doesn't offer that or classic fantasy.
B009CPES4I|5.0|Of course you could watch this at any age over 25 if you are sentimental about friendships and life.  If you are from the senior set you will get special enjoyment out of this romp by a troupe of seniors from England who relocate to India for an affordable retirement.  The scenes shot in the streets gave an authentic feel for being in this part of the world.  Been there, and I'll never forget it.  Enjoy.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|it works great for my kindle fire. I use it all the time to fix photos that are colored weird.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I wasn't sure this was for my age group, although I was intrigued and it kept me interested. It was more of Grey's history unfolding that kept me there and of course I was curious about what all my friends were talking about!
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|Amazing cinematography and nice music.  Love seeing how they made the film, which they show during the credits. Captures chimp life so well.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Not quite what I expected. I began to gloss over the sex scenes because frankly as a woman, and one that has always enjoyed sex, even at 21 some of the scenes seemed a little far fetched. But I loved the storyline, couldn't put it down and was intrigued by Greys history and journey.
B008N1V11U|5.0|this game is so amazing I cant think of any other game that fulfilled batman so well you might as well be watching the dark knight rises the only difference is you control everything
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its really cool and you get to buy a horse and feed the horse and care for the horse its cool
1250007208|4.0|Cinder takes place in the future and is basically a retelling of Cinderella while being a completely new, unique story. Cyborgs play an important role in it, that fact alone makes the story interesting. When I started reading it, I already had completely forgotten that there were Cinderella elements in it and didn't remember until about 100 pages into the story... so it's really not obvious at all. Either that, or I am just really inattentive.<br /><br />The heroine is Cinder, a mechanic. I've quickly grown to like her, but at times she was a little unnerving. She has a tendency to pity herself because of her being a cyborg, which is probably understandable considering the status of cyborgs in the story, but still irritates me. I really hope she will become more self-accepting in the continuations. Other than that, she's a cool and smart girl. She's charming in an odd way, and I can totally see why the male protagonist, Prince Kaito, finds an interest in her. As the story progressed, she grew braver and more self-confident, which I liked.<br /><br />There's one thing that bothered me, though. The characters seemed, with the exception of Cinder and the doctor, a bit flat. Even Kai felt a little shallow to me, but I hope this can be fixed in the sequels. I like books with characters that feel real; like a real person with dreams, hopes, regrets, imperfections, little quirks, a past and all that. Of course Cinder is such a character because the story is told in her point of view. She's closest to the reader, and we can basically look into her head, know all her thoughts and feelings. We don't get to know much about the doctor but to me, he seemed very real. I can literally imagine a whole book being written about him. With Kai, I can't imagine that. There's just not enough substance.<br /><br />Although there's not a lot of romance in the book, it was enough to make me happy! (And I'm a sucker for romance.) Naturally it was a bit cliché (it's Cinderalla-inspired afterall) but I liked that the relationship between the two developed in a slow, natural way (and I'm sure will still develop a lot in the next books).<br /><br />Marissa Meyer's writing style is neat and beautiful. It is detailed, but not over the top. I was able to imagine all the locations and places very vividly, but that's something that goes for almost every book I read. You get sucked into the story extremely fast, due to the simple writing style. Everything is easy to follow and I didn't get confused a single time. I dislike when I have to reread passages because the author's wording was too complicated to comprehend what was happening.<br /><br />There's a good mix of predictable things and surprises, though maybe a bit more of the former than the latter. Nonetheless, the story was absolutely thrilling and I read the second half in one sitting. The ending depressed me a little, not because it was bad, but because it broke my heart to know that I wouldn't be able to read the sequel until February. (Which seemed infinitely far away at that time. Now it's only a few weeks away and I'm so excited!)<br /><br />All in all, this was a good book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not world-changing and it's not the best novel I've ever read, but in the end it does what it's supposed to do: it entertains. I give it four stars.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing, is Brooks the only survivor of a forgotten zombie apocalypse, the detail and depth of the book is the best I've read.

B009CG3M1C|5.0|This movie has great visial effects !!! The stars are great in this.check this movie out if you like good action in a movie.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Despite some uncomfortable moments, I really like this movie.  I think it was well cast and very witty.  I was pleasantly surprised by the lead female's voice; and I loved the choreography.  Of course, since this movie is about college students &#34;making music with their mouths&#34;, the a capella had to be pretty good.  I thought it was.  It made me want to join a group and see if I could do that cool and funky stuff.<br /><br />If I could change anything, it would be to have an option, or even a video on the DVD of the performances from the audience' point of view, without the close ups.  I wanted to see the whole show.<br /><br />Thank you, L

B003VWU2WA|5.0|This is such a good idea, unique.  It is fun and dynamic, I have really enjoyed it for programming and switching through tabs of classes.  It also makes simple web surfing fun as well, it works a lot like a classic iPod in that sense for scrolling through the page quickly.  I have a mac and it works great, you have to go to their website to download the driver and the program for editing the functions that it performs is other applications.  I comes preset with some already but you can change them to do what you want.

B007ZD17XO|5.0|It's fun and addictive. Glad I got it, just as good if not better than the second Montezuma game. If you like match 3 games, you'll be satisfied.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I picked this just to see if it is Jack Reacher by David Baldacci. Have not read The Affair, yet, but I will. Puller does seem very close to Reacher in personality and skills. Both have outstanding military skills, and both are quite intelligent. Both are serious to a fault. Not much humor in these guys. Puller is still in the military, which Reacher was not the last time I read about him. Puller also follows protocol, chain of command and so forth, which Reacher does not. It makes Puller's job particularly difficult.<br /><br />The plot is well-constructed, pretty straight-line, which I like. I figured the story and plot quickly, but it was still fun to read the transitions and where the author went with the character. What can I say? I like Puller and Reacher, even if both are a stretch.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|This thought-provoking novel done in a series of letters format addressed to an unknown friend narrated by a middle school boy, who is something of a wallflower himself.  His problem is thst he can't seem to be a participant in anything.  He muses about the pains, joys, mishaviors, and books his teacher gives him to read and write essays on.  While he attends many of these activities, he always seems to be observing only.  The young narrator also covers the sexl and drugs that many of his friends indulge in, but he does not experience either of these activities.  As to the title, one might assume that the &#34;Perks&#34; refers to the boy Charlie being an observer without having to experience the emotions.This is a read that is alternately serious, amusing, and analytic in the artful style of its author.
B00932A2MC|4.0|My 12 yr old loved this movie, it's not gonna win any Oscars, but it's clean, fun, and full of action.  It's like a lot of movies I remember watching and loving at his age, and my parents rolled their eyes back then too.

0547564651|4.0|Paul Tough's How Children Succeed challenges the conventional wisdom of educational success being significantly correlated with acquired knowledge and IQ. Character, he argues, is a much better measure even if it's not easily measurable.<br /><br />I agree with Tough's assertion, and he presents a number of impressive case studies to make his point. A child raised in poverty will have many more obstacles to overcome before successfully reaching adulthood, but we must not discount the character-building worth a difficult upbringing will cause, stressful though it is. There's a value that comes from hardships of this kind, and, if channeled properly, this school-of-hard-knocks is perhaps the greatest teacher.

B00AG51RU6|4.0|I saw this in the theater. The car chase in this film is awesome. Yes, Bruce's character gets killed off. That, said it's still fairly good. I tend to disagree with one reviewer, about not taking this film seriously. Also to put Taken on the same level as the Bourne films is unfair. Taken is so much better the Bourne films ever could be. Also, there seems to another story lying beneath the surface if you think for a minute. It seems portray the tenuous relationship that Israel and our country have in real life; and the trust issues that lye therein. There's a nice cameo by Colm Meany (of Star Trek).

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book is a page turner for me, and I could not put it down!<br /><br />Adam Brown was a very adventurous youth who never said &#34;I can't.&#34; His attitude made up for small stature. and he excelled at sports. Then in college, he did not make the team, and dropped out before graduation. Once he tried crack cocaine he was hooked. And like most addicts, it over took him. Friends and family were shocked, and the appalled by the changes in Adam. He went to a one year treatment center, and got clean, but the drug kept &#34;Calling his name&#34;, and he could not stop relapsing. Then he met Kelly, and really fell in love, and tried to stop. It still called his name. After hitting a bottom, he went to join the Navy, and only an intervention from a friends father got him in with his record.  In spite of brief relapses, Adam became a Navy Seal, and the made Elite Navy Seal Team Six. Even though this is true story, it grabbed me! David
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is an exciting and sensuous filled with romance and unbelievable intrigue.  I started reading this out of curiosity and soon was drawn into the escapades of the main two characters.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed a good romance and curiosity of a 'different'<br /> lifestyle.
B00130EVSS|5.0|I rented Eastern Promises because the story was the first I had seen about the Russian Mafia and it had Viggo Mortenson as the star.  The plot involves the death of an abused Russian minor who gives birth to a baby girl. The doctor who helps her finds her diary and asks her Russian uncle to translate it English.  The uncle is alarmed when he realizes what happened to the girl is related to the Vor the Russian Mafia. There is a fight scene in a bath house when Viggo is setup and blamed for murder he did not commit. He wins a fight against two assassins naked and unarmed it. was a fantastic scene worth renting the movie for that alone. Viggo is an Russian undercover cop who needs  to take down the head of the group and take his place. The writing of the female doctors character has her stupidly challenging men who would have killed her without a second thought.  Good thing Viggo liked her.

B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This movie is all about gore with a tiny bit of plot. If you are into sic-fi and an abundance of violence, this is the movie for you. If you are not a fan of heads blowing up, being split in half, squished, ..., do not watch this movie.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I love mysteryville 2. It is fun to play. It is so hard to find good hidden object games that dont cost an arm and a leg to download and play. It is entertaining and addicting.

The whole cd is great I love every song on it! I have already recomended it to family and friends. Its a cd I can play over and over and not get tired of it! Im deffinetely a fan!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I read this book over the summer, and man, was it good. I read it in one day. I hid in my brother's room (in order to spend time with him) and I was just stuck inside the story ALL. DAY. LONG. It was THAT good. I absolutely loved the relationship between Will and Lake. I loved the slam poetry. I just loved everything about this book. I cried quite a bit, at several different parts. It was a very emotional book. I honestly can't believe I hadn't found the book sooner than I did. I don't know how I lived without this book in my life and in my heart.<br /><br />Another thing I really loved about the book was the fact that each chapter had lyrics from The Avett Brothers' songs that corresponded to the content and themes in the chapters. I thought this was an absolutely beautiful addition to the story, and it was crafted so well. Plus, since then, I have listened to The Avett Brothers more and more because I've fallen in love with the music. I created a playlist of all the songs that have an important part in Slammed, and I plan to read this book again with said playlist running as background music.<br /><br />Believe me when I say that you have to read this book. Colleen Hoover is an incredible writer, and very original. The book was perfect and beautiful and you're really missing out if you haven't read it. Pick it up. You won't be sorry. I will carry this book with me for the rest of my life.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I  WAS HESITANT  ON READING THIS BOOK BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK I WOULD LIKE IT.  AS IT TURNS OUT I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN AND READ IT IN TWO DAYS.

0345803485|5.0|I can not believe that people were trashing this series. I couldn't get enough of it and now that I've read it twice I miss the characters. I loved that Ana was a strong headed woman and didn't let Christian have his way... She told him how it was I like a strong woman. As for Christian I want one of my own Lordy Lordy. First you think my gosh this guy is depraved then you fall in love with him and then you want your very own Christian. I've read it twice and plan on reading it again. And I have to say the last chapter in the last book which gave you Christians side made my blood temperature spike... I've heard rumor that there is another trilogy coming with his side and if true I can't wait. Want me some more Christian <3.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, and Edgar Wright. Enough said. This movie is unique, action-filled, and a joy to watch. There is too many memorable quotes to list.<br /><br />Plain and simple, if you enjoyed Shaun of the Dead, you will definitely enjoy Hot Fuzz.<br />Can't wait for The World's End in 2013!<br /><br />Yes, it could be considered a little gory for some but it isn't much to keep you away from it. The writing and acting is brilliant.

B009IEXKXI|3.0|This otherwise excellent story leaves a bad taste in your mouth  right up to the very end.  It insults the reader.<br /><br />Here is a story about a man who is supposed to have superior intelligence and character, having been chosen as a elite member of  the space program to Mars.<br /><br />He survives insurmountable odds outwitting the space program's very best.  One would expect to want cheer his survival but in the end he behaves no better than  a base oaf.  Too selfish to be kind even to a young chid admirer.<br /><br />No space program would select such a loser.
1481251880|5.0|She does it again - compelling characters, a gripping and unpredictable storyline, and flawless plotting. Hoover is one of the finest authors to emerge in years.<br />This book is part mystery, part psychological thriller, and part romance. You will cheer Sky and Holden on and become engrossed in their story.<br />What begins as a clever high school love story twists quickly into a mystery. The character development is excellent. You will feel you know Sky, her best friend, and her mother. Her GBF is terrific and avoids being a stereotype. As Sky unlocks her past you will root for this smart and likable heroine.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game for if you like to build cool stuff. I personally love survival the best I think it is more fun to work for what you build. Creative is fun in all but creative gets old fast. It might be expensive but it is worth it.
B001N9ESQ4|3.0|The first thing to ask yourself is:  Do you like movies where nothing happens?  Not even an argument?  That is this film---both of them actually;  A movie about two thirty-somethings who met on a train 9 years ago and spent that night walking the streets of Vienna, also doing nothing but talking.  Now they've run into each other again----he is now a married author who's written a book about that night, hoping she'd show up to one of the signings, and in Paris, she does.<br /><br />No action (save for some walking and eating).  No Violence, not even any arguments.  No sex or nudity.  Not for everybody.<br /><br />One can fall into using words like &#34;moving&#34;, and &#34;inspiring&#34; but one would be getting careless.  &#34;Before Sunset&#34; and &#34;Before Sunrise&#34; are at the drier end of RomComs, or as they're also often called &#34;Chick Flicks&#34;.  The conversations aren't deep, don't search out the existential questions or the order of the Universe.  In fact, as the characters establish themselves and their lives 9 years on from our first encounter, some of the conversation sounds like a laundry list of righteous Lefty do-gooderism.  One is caught nodding in tedium, &#34;Okay, okay, we get that, let's get on with it...&#34;  And then, they leave the cafe and start to walk and the movie is back where we liked it 9 years ago.  A nice, long, conversation between two people who clearly have deep affections for each other and official ties to two other people, lives that have become encumbered in the absence of a real connection between the two erstwhile lovers, and now they've met up again....<br /><br />Nothing is resolved.  There's a third movie (&#34;Before Midnight&#34;) set to premier at Cannes this year.  I'm betting that superfluous spouses are going to have died...<br /><br />This isn't the first film where the same actors have collaborated over a long period of time---&#34;Star Wars&#34; and &#34;Indiana Jones&#34; are two modern epics;  then there's the &#34;Thin Man Series&#34; that started out on the elegant side of the Depression and died a painful death in the wholesome homefront of rediscovered pieties during WWII.  Julie Delpy is an graceful older version of her girlish self;  Ethan Hawke looks as if he's taken up an entry level existence in a Charles Bukowski novel, between films.<br /><br />I like this concept---one slim story, the same two actors, one film every 9 years.  Something will probably happen in the third film, and if it doesn't wipe out the franchise, I can see watching this concept go on until both actors are old.  Will they ever get married?  Will that complete or destroy them?<br /><br />Hmmm.<br /><br />Again, not a film for everybody, but if you like this sort of slow moving river of a movie, you should enjoy this one (and you might want to check out Catherine Deneuve in &#34;A Christmas Tale&#34; which is a somewhat more energetic and spicy version of the same idea---not a holiday film by any standards).

B003VANOFY|5.0|+ Very comfortable.  The only thing that rests on your head is the top, which is well padded.  Therefore, you dont have any soreness around the ears, or anything, like you would with cheaper headsets.<br /><br />+ Quality of sound is good.  Still trying to figure out why, however, they do not sound as good as my previous headphones, BUT I honestly think this is just because these are new, and I am not used to them, I would not knock the quality of sound at all.<br /><br />+ It's wireless... like.... you can keep talking while you go grab a drink.  It's the gaming hermit's wet dream! ;)<br /><br />Con - PRICE.  It's really expensive, and while I understand that a wireless, surround sound, gaming headset is something special, $120 is EXTREMELY steep for the actual product.  I would rest the best price around 70 - 90.  If you can find it for that, then you will have a great trade between money, and product.  Otherwise, for $120, it's just a really good, headset to buy when you are looking to waste some money on your dangerously anti-social gaming habits, like me. :)
B00571F26Y|3.0|The author's theme is that modern wheat has been so genetically altered that it is now very high glycemic and consumption spikes our blood sugar and insulin, resulting in most Americans being overweight or obese and fat around our midsections.  You are a believer after about 20 pages, but then he attempts to make a case that wheat consumption contributes to about every health problem you could name , and that is where he lost me.  By the end of the book, you realize that it is not just wheat products, but almost all carbohydrates, or any food with a moderate to high glycemic index.  When you have to make a sandwich wrap out of your own ground flax seed, that is where the doctor lost me!

067960085X|5.0|Reading a novel after watching the film is not always a \\"ruined\\" experience.  This is a book which I read decades after watching the film, and years after watching the film for the umpteenth time.<br /><br />If the book is not interesting, the previous learning from film permits the reader to skim.  But, that is not the case with this novel.<br /><br />And, it is not the same as the movie.  Many of the situations are more racy, or less racy.  First, Holly is not the girl to \\"have it with\\" and live happily ever after with.  Oh, no.  She ends this book as the movie commenced - a treasure-troving fortune hunting gal who is no deeper a personality than Anna Nicole Smith.  Maybe, she says more interesting things, but each has the same ultimate goal - a marriage to someone who will forever pay their bills.<br /><br />Secondly, this book reflects signs of the times.  Dropping the \\"N\\" word freely depicts something about her rural past when she had to escape via a marriage at 14 years of age to a veterinarian. In today's world, that may be editorialized as the white urbanite's use of the \\"N\\" word is not the same as the black rural person's.<br /><br />Thirdly, the book deals lightly with lesbianism and bisexuality.  The movie does not.  Think of how America would have reacted had its adoring child, Audrey Hepburn, discussed her idolatry for a relationship with Greta Garbo and why bisexuality is a superior alternative to the heterosexual lifestyle she had led using men to obtain freedom from foster homes, or obtain money for a New York brownstone's rent.<br /><br />Lastly, the main character - called Fred in the book as opposed to Paul in the movie - is sexually ambiguous. Capote stated he was gay. The movie made him a paid man who used a benefactress's wealth to pay for his wares while he pecked at the keyboard attempting to write the great American novel or novella.<br /><br />So, the book is not identical - most importantly it differs on the sexual context.  Things are freer and more open in the publication world, where censors were less stringent in the middle 20th century.<br /><br />But, the real reason to read this novel, and most importantly any novel, is to experience the richness of the writing of the author. \\"Suddenly, she was blind. And, since gin to artifice bears the same relation as tears to mascara, her attractions at once dissembled. She took it out on everyone.\\"<br /><br />It is a quick and pithy read. Well worth the few hours it takes to read.er and more open in the publication world, where censors were less stringent in the middle 20th century.<br /><br />But, the real reason to read this novel, and most importantly any novel, is to experience the richness of the writing of the author. \\"Suddenly, she was blind.

B0027MJU00|4.0|I greatly enjoyed this book because it was difficult to guess the outcome. I liked how the story was split between the present day and in 1985. I also liked how this author makes her main characters in her stories to be really flawed. If you like Gone Girl then you will enjoy this book.

B0002IQNAG|5.0|This movie is not for everyone, if you like zombies that run, CGI effects, or you complain about not being able to follow the story-line...this movie is not for you. It's for people who get enjoyment out of the \\"comic book style\\" effects, the awesome quotes, the well remembered scenes..everything a good movie should have. If you're going to nit pick it you're going to have a bad time. If your a critic and you don't like this movie, you should get another hobby/job. This is the definitive zombie movie, zombies don't run, they walk. If you want zombies to run and \\"scare\\" you instead of having a good time watching it, go watch the remake, the new \\"Dawn\\" is just a modern rendition that leaves out all fun, and just goes in for the extreme factor which is why the Horror genre is now crumbling. George A. Romero, the A is for \\"A f***ing genius.\\"

B002ZG97RE|2.0|So, in 2010, who among us didn't know that we found no WMD in Iraq? Wasn't it some number close to ZERO? So why make a movie about it, or rather, about the search for WMD?<br /><br />I so wished the movie had focused more on the bizarre activities described in Rajiv Chandrasekaran's book. Although the film did provide glimpses of it (the pool scene for example), they stood out there with no support, leaving an average viewer to brush it off with little thought. Had more been done in this area I believe at least a morsel of knowledge would have transferred to show how royally screwed up the US Government was then and still is.<br /><br />Unfortunately we end up with another typical war flick featuring \\"the lonely rogue soldier doing the right thing\\" character, \\"the sole leader who is on his side\\" character, \\"the evil administration\\" guy, on and on. Oh, I forgot---how DID this movie end?? Oh I remember---they didn't find WMD in Iraq.<br /><br />I can find no criticism of Matt Damon here. He plays these parts as good as anyone, and this is no exception. I can't fault the director Paul Greengrass much either. He did a great job bringing war into our laps (although I will have to add my vote for too much much jiggling of the camera). I thought the backdrop excellent throughout too...colorless, dirty, war-torn towns...this is the Iraq I picture when thinking of that era.<br /><br />Green Zone is a well done botched opportunity. Although entertaining, it is definitely NOT a must see.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|its a great app. I absolutely love it. I like the display and the alarm sounds. it actually works. thanks
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game and easy to understand it and play. I am enjoying the game and get to basically see all the things that are involved with taking care of a horse.<br />.
B002APU580|5.0|The reason I purchased this dvd was for Matthew MacFadyen's performance as Mr. Darcy.  I thought he was outstanding, and I almost always enjoy Keira Knightley.  Good cast, and interesting commentary by the director.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Can't stop playing. This is the best war game I have ever played. I have played some games on my PC  and I enjoy this one more than any of the others.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|It was a great story but being foreign the names gave me trouble.  I had to write them down and refer back often.
030759565X|5.0|I've been a big fan of Deb's blog for awhile now, and was thrilled to finally peruse her cookbook. Her recipes are simpler than the final result would suggest, which is to say she has a great talent for creating extraordinary meals out of simple ingredients. The instructions are clear and detailed, and I enjoy the introductions to each recipe. A great addition to any food lover's collection.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|One of the best action films my wife and I have ever seen.  Our hearts were in our throats throughout the ventire movie.
0345529057|5.0|Great price. Nice box set, nothing fancy.<br /><br />I gave this to a friend as a Christmas present and they love it.
0765325950|5.0|Okay, if I rated this anything other than five stars, I'd be retroactively proclaiming myself an idiot...I've been reading this 1000+ page-per-book series for fifteen years.  This is the final book and the third after the author's death.<br /><br />I've read some pretty terrible series conclusions based off the original author's purported notes. *coughDUNEcough*  Brandon Sanderson rescued this series...we all know books 1-6, by Robert Jordan, were incredible, and that incredible-ness was reflected in the sales figures.  Books 7-11 weren't, uh, quite so good, but, by then, we were so many thousands of pages in, and the earlier books were SO GOOD, that we couldn't give up.<br /><br />Robert Jordan passed away before he could complete the series.  His work had splashes of obvious genius, but he was getting increasingly scattered (in every way).  Brandon Sanderson, working from Jordan's notes, brought everything back together for a fantastic end to the series.  That must have been so ridiculously difficult (readers know *exactly* what I mean) that Sanderson has to have a touch of genius himself.<br /><br />Minor flaws.  Not better than Hamlet.  Fantastic series, amazing work by Sanderson in the last books, and all things considered, everything about this book was pretty much great.<br /><br />This is a 4.5 star end to the Wheel of Time.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Brilliant! Every chapter there is a wee clue, then it spins in another direction.Keeps you guessing! Good detective novel.Rebus lovers will love this one, as he gets up to his old tricks.
B006WQLH7G|3.0|I have only had this on my Kindle Fire HD for a couple of days so I'm not sure how it works. It has a lot of features and I feel that my Kindle is protected. I have noticed that my Kindle seems slower since I put this program on but I don't really know if that is why. I do get a strange messag: UI Layout Initialization Warning. The layout-container &#34;DIV#page-wrapper&#34; has no height.<br />Therefore the layout is 0-height and hence 'invisible'!<br />I don't know what that means so I click OK and it goes away, but I'm not sure I will keep avast on my Kindle.
0525953728|5.0|Really enjoyed. It is well written, interesting, educational, and sobering. Also, it made a fine gift for my dad. Strongly recommend.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Not every book lives up to the hype when a movie comes out.  This series seems to avoid that pitfall.  I'm looking forward to reading the third book.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Just started the game but I'm liking it so far. Hopefully it doesn't turn into a game that I need to spend real money on.
B000PFU7OO|4.0|I really loved this movie but found the soundtrack to lack cohesion. The sad songs were interspersed with the more upbeat songs which is jarring and ruins a mood. Love the two singers' voices though. The harmonies are gorgeous. Sad that those two didn't make it together as a couple in real life.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I think this is the best free game on here. Download free for some fun. It is just like the game at carnivals
0684808323|3.0|If you are really into organized crime then maybe this would be a little more interesting.  I struggled to finish this book without falling asleep.
1451627289|5.0|This book did not disappoint.  Could not put it down; what a story...to be able to go back and change events.
0553381709|5.0|This gets five stars because this book and the series is awesome.  I liked this book because of its awesomeness and other awesome qualities.  I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys awesome things.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Not enough action. Way too much clever departs. Slow moving.<br />Okay read but not as well done as previously read adventure of John Corey.
6304711905|5.0|Doc.  Is there any other reason to watch this movie other than the fact that Val Kilmer plays Doc?  The answer is no.  Every man, woman, and child needs to not only watch this movie but study it and memorize it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Wow!!! great book with a finality that left both saddened but satisfied.  An enjoyable series to read.  Hope I'm able to enjoy future readings as much as I did these.
1449410243|5.0|I follow the author on Twitter and have seen his website/blog.  He has a number of great comics and being a cat person this book is great.  So great that I sent a copy to 2 of my sisters as well!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was an  amazing read.  It nuances the &#34;the cost&#34; that the children of the non-jewish residents paid for witnessing their government and often their families collaborating in the atrocities against the Jews.  It explores the pain and also the quiet heroism that some of the most vulnerable paid in taking a stand against their government's terrible injustice.  It is a story of how the youngest among us can witness how to be brave, authentic and survive with their humanity intact.  Well written, no sentimentalism, just raw powerful truth.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|I PURCHASED THIS HORRENDOUS APP IN JAN. 2013, for kindle fire he. I waited 10 . MINS. FOR THIS STUPID APP TO OPEN UP. NOTHING. TRIED THREE MORE TIMES, STILL NOTHING. IT WILL NOT OPEN UP ON KINDLE FIRE PERIOD. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|the game is fun but doesn't regenerate coins correctly. they say they will give you x number of coins but only give you y number of coins
B00APUQH0W|5.0|it was a fun enjoyable movie.  It proves a movie can be good without vulgar languages, explits sex scenes,and someone getting killed.
B00821PCJS|5.0|The plausible personalities of the charichter mix and the continued factor of positive triumphs over all odds that say their success should not prevail but in real life it is always the one that has the undivided faith and total understanding that all things are possible by seeing and then applying that vision and low and behold it is done no fear and no doubt that you just as any famous person of great accomplishment has done.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I bought this book I thought it w was going to be completely different. I loved every minute of this book though! I read it in less than a day and even skipped school to read it. she has an amazing way of writing and getting the readers attention. The story is so sad but wonderful.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|the guys are totaly awesome on this cd good to see in concert all the songs<br />are just  fantastic two thumbs up
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Nice games for kids. In the game, you take care of your horse by feeding, cleaning the pasture, and training your horse.
B00A757EFW|2.0|I was not overly impressed. It did not give me enough that I would consider purchasing it, but appreciated the opportunity
B007PBKG5G|5.0|A good collection of music - different sound; refreshing to hear.I had heard a track they did for &#34;Silver Linings Playlist&#34; score and purchased their CD to hear more form this group
B007THA4FI|3.0|This was a breakaway from past books for Rowling. Very dark and disturbing, but not in a good way. Well written, but not very enjoyable.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|This was the first science fiction book I ever read in 1961 in grade school. I cannot even begin to explain the profound affect it had on me. It is a true classic from one of the masters of the genre.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who values truly great science fiction that is well written with ideas which are compelling and relevant today even though it was written the year I was born.  Many people do not realize he was also a scientist and won the Marconi Award for coming up with the idea of communication satellites. I have been waiting for this book to become available on kindle and had requested this last year. Thank you Amazon for making it available and his other great novels and superb short stories as well. Clarke was a true visionary and while 2001 was a great movie I have always thought this novel would be an even better one. If you have ever pondered the universe and our place in it you will love this book. I can now put my paperback copy which is now 50 years old, worn and falling apart, lovingly away.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun and entertaining<br /> It's educational and great for kids! It's an amazing game in case you can't afford  to have an actual horse!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it, I wish it was a little more explicit. Looking forward to the sequel,once again the author dose an amazing job of pulling you in.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|Though this movie clocked in at just under two hours, nearly four-fifths of it was devoted to fighting sequences.  The Paul Verhoeven version at least had the virtue of a complicated, but intriguing plot.  This version's plot had as many holes as Doug Quaid's swiss-cheese memory!  Read the original story instead.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Wonderful.  This is one of Masterpiece's finest stories and to be able to get both seasons at such a good price, you can't beat it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is awesome and fun and I would recommend. this game for any one who lovessss horses and I would suggustvthis app for any one 3 and older
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|I thought it was a good movie. I'm a Tim Burton Fan so the movie is what I expected. Although the main character looks exactly like the one from Corpse Bride and I think they have the same name too.
0425252868|5.0|My husband heard about this book and asked me to order one for him.  He is NOT an avid reader, only reads a couple of books each year, but he couldn't put this one down - I think he read it in one day.  He loved it!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The AHS series 1 & 2 are some of the best that have come along in years.  I usually find TV lame and tiresome, but this has changed my entire outlook!
B000T45C6E|4.0|This a great movie.  I wish everyone would have this type of work mentality. Just a great feel good movie.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book really was a pleasant surprise for me. I wasn't sure if I would enjoy it, but now I can't wait for the sequel!
B009O07NDY|5.0|I am a huge fan of the soundtracks for LotR, and this soundtrack manages to take me back to the Middle Earth that I'm familiar with while introducing new aspects of that magical place.  Kudos to Howard Shore for finding that balance.
B004WDRT1Y|4.0|This is. a great movie, but unfortunately the 3D just didn't transfer as well.  Despite our best efforts to fix the quality, it was blurry and unfocused, not so bad that we couldn't watch it but still unpleasant.
0385536828|3.0|This one sort of wanders - feels like its going no where, describing dinners and intimate encounters...for the bulk of the novel.<br />Plus, I found the \\"name dropping\\" and commending of McEwan's friend, Martin Amis, annoying.<br /><br />All in all, not his best.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The book was a really good read as most all of Grisham's.  I expected a stronger ending with more sting. It was exciting and moving just too smooth. Overall the book is great
B009PJ1Q82|5.0|Memphis raised director Ira Sachs has created a magical world of raw sentiment, unexpected beauty and bittersweet truths that renews faith in American independent filmmaking. I'd urge anyone discovering this wonderful director (\\"The Delta\\", \\"40 Shades of Blue\\", \\"Marriage\\")  NOT to pay attention to the taglines or story descriptions. In most case to tell the story of a film is to anticipate much of its pleasure. In the case of  \\"Keep the Lights on,\\" it doesn't come close. So much of the delight of this film is in what can't be explained or prepared for. It's a love story that is classically moving but one that's also completely unconventional, challenging any person's notion of what desire, intimacy and commitment might mean.  A beautiful and original film.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|fun for kids recommend to all parents this is a fun coordinating game for kids that will keep them busy for hours
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|My wife and I were staying in on a Saturday night and bickering about what movie to watch. There are tens of thousands of movies and none of them sparked any inspiration. We are some truly jaded and picky viewers. I like spooky-scary movies but I hate gore and stupid plot lines. She wants to be jolted by mysteries and thrillers with cutting edge intelligence. Searching for Sugar Man caught my eye. We read the notes and both agreed that we would change to another movie if it sucked. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?<br /><br />Let me just tell you that we were mesmerized. The story starts out simply enough; no hysterics, no car crashes or brazen beauties. Just a couple of first person interviews about how an obscure musician's music came to influence a generation of fans on the other side of the world. But much like the music itself, the story enveloped us, willingly, carrying us through a different era, different places but familiar, like looking at family pictures through an old window. You only think you know what's going to happen. Allow yourself to enjoy your suspension of disbelief and just kick back and relax. Let it unfold, let it set up the banquet and escort you to your chair. You're going to have the best movie nourishment you've had in a long time. You cannot walk away from this movie without feeling good and full.
B004GVUPFE|4.0|When I first played this game, I thought, &#34;Not too bad of a game.&#34;  Now that I've played it a few times, I'm not as excited as I was when I played it the first time.  It was a good game, I think I lost interest mainly because it was the same ole thing over and over again, just a little more challenging than the previous round...  It can keep me busy while I wait in line or at the doctors office though. :)
B0079R8KO0|5.0|I reviewed several options for Kindle Fire covers before purchasing one and am happy that I chose this cover. I don't need a side pocket; just wanted something that would protect the Kindle and make it easier to hold while reading in bed. It meets both of these needs perfectly. It also can be used to stand the Kindle up for movie viewing. I don't really use this feature so far,  but when trying it out, it worked well.
0765334798|3.0|I doubt if the famous authors quoted on the cover actually read this book, because it's not funny.  Or maybe it's an inside joke for the author and his friends.  If so, I didn't get it.  In fact, I thought the first 230 pages were crap, and I thought the following 40 pages (all of Coda 1) were the worst sort of intrusive-writer-with-a-massive-ego crap I'd ever read. But then, in Coda 2 the story took hold of me, and I started to get it.  And I liked it.  And by the end of the story, I got a little choked up and the resonance at the end made up for the sense that I was wasting my time on the first 270 pages.  The thing is though, you HAVE to read 270 pages of crap to get the gist of what the author is trying to say (and it really DOES need to be there), and it doesn't help that the author's continuous intrusions into the story include repetitive comments about how bad the writing is.  And it is.  Bad.<br /><br />Until the last 46 pages.<br />I was all set not to like this book.  I'd never read any of Scazi's other work, and when I first realized it was yet another lousy bit of shallow fan fiction based on Star Trek (or excuse me, Stargate: Universe), I just about threw the book across the room.  But I persevered, and even appreciated the nod to quantum physics and parallel universes. In the end, I enjoyed the book.  Yes, the characters are shallow, and there is no real protagonist here (or at least not until the final few pages). Yes, it's a kind of a `trick' story, but one I found ultimately satisfying as a sort of a hopeful love story.
B000I55YVM|5.0|LOVE ADAM AND LOVE THIS  MOVIE..............I PLAN ON GETTING MORE FOR SURE...NOT A WASTE OF MONEY..AN OLDER MOVIE, BUT A CLASSIC
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I have been playing Mahjong on my computer for some time, but to be able to take with me on my Kindle and play anytime any where helps keep my mind sharp.
B005XCX1CY|5.0|A GREAT MOVIE, GREAT ACTORS.....SO MANY LAUGHS THAT WE HAVE WATCHED IT MANY TIMES FOR OUR FRIENDS....THE MUSIC IF FANTASTIC..............
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is made to move fast and easy to play.  If you enjoy Solitaire you will love this game here. Moves are fast and smooth.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I have read Her Sweetest Downfall by the same author, which left me wanting for more. Forever Girl ties into it a little. The book is easy to read, with soft humor, unexpected turns and likable characters. I finished book in 2 nights, it is the kind you can't put away unless you are finished.<br />This story is different from everything else I have ever read.  It has everything - a little bit of love, a little bit of vampires, a little bit of magic, a little bit of sarcasm and irony. It is a fine piece of young adult fiction; I would recommend it to anybody who likes the genre. I'm sure it will leave you wanting for more as well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|ilove this game I just cant get enough. I'm completely addicted! its not like the other games that hey boring after an hour or so.
B0041KKYBA|4.0|But infuriating. The documentary explained what happened back in 2008 so clearly I can explain it to other people now.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE THIS HORSE APP ITS SOOOOOOO AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! Anyone who says otherwise, will be killed in their fricken sleep!!!!!! You can take care of the horse, u can feed it, AND u can do all sorts of stuff!!!! There is so much stuff u can do, i cant even name them all!! I highly recomend this app. im an 11 year old girl. The best thing about it is, ITS FRICKEN FREE UNLESS U BUY SOMETHING WITH REAL MONEY PEOPLE!! U NEED TO BUY THUS APP! U WILL NEVER REGRET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Story line was a bit slow and predictable.  The surprise ending made up for a lot of tediousness in the early reading.
B00633W614|5.0|This author brings his characters to life consistently through out his stories and his titles are so appropriate for his tales.
B00979CS50|5.0|If you love great rock and roll, this is a must have!  Ramada Inn, and Walk like a Giant, two amazing wonderful songs, that speak from Neil's heart to ours!  The word genius comes to mind.
B009KKLQKO|5.0|this DVD is just like being at the concert.  They have not lost their charm.  Any old teenagers will LOVE it!
B000006TZ8|5.0|Here, The Jam are still rocking with authority, but Paul Weller's songwriting has grown to encompass new ideas and moods; more complex harmonic ideas than were utilized on the first two albums have made their way into several tunes, allowing the band to sound varied without burying themselves with excess instrumentation. This is arguably the best album for one of rock's most inspiring bands.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I rather enjoyed this unlikely tale of an old man who gets tangled up with crime when he makes is bid for freedom and independence.  It's entirely far-fetched, but somehow it worked for me.  A bit raunchy at times.  Scandinavian dry and wry point of view.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|My little girl loves this game, but you have to be very careful and supervise them. It's too easy to buy things with real money (as with most apps). Other than that, it's a great entertainment.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|Hooked to this game until I finished it.  Really enjoyed it.  Easy to learn and different levels of difficulty keep the replay value high.
B001EC2IV2|5.0|Arnold does a good job in this movie. He's the man. Alot of good action throughout the movie. A definite see.
B0083GQKQG|3.0|The &#34;evil child&#34; genre is familiar film territory, but this is disturbing and well done.  &#34;Kevin&#34; is one of the most repellent children in film history; the viewer wishes he had been institutionalized early on.  But then, of course, there wouldn't have been a film.<br /><br />Tilda Swinton is a brilliant actress.
B0000AK7A8|5.0|This is a really fun movie with an excellent cast! Teenagers will love it as well as us much older folks.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app for nighttime. The Melodies I make are so soothing like flowing silk. I love this app!!! 5 stars!!!
B004J64QR4|1.0|May I get more information on when I can expect this particular item?  It was supposed to be a Christmas gift, but still have not received
0670026603|2.0|When I first began to read this novel, I liked It. However, I became bored and eventually abandoned it. It felt oddly predictable.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I had bought this book in paperback and there was a whole section missing. Thankfully, I had my kindle and could purchase it again through there (that's how good it was - I couldn't wait!) so I could pick up right where I left off. A must read if you like mysteries and thrillers!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|nice graphics and good story line. Hint button gives just enough to get you on track without spoiling the fun. Hidden object games are great. You need to keep track of where you are as you have to backtrack a lot.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So much better than I thought it was going to be and I can't wait to read the rest of this series!
B00A81NFAS|5.0|It's not Casablanca or Citizen Kane in terms of a cinematic masterpiece, but this is one of the most heartfelt, feel good movies I've ever seen. I left the theatre feeling so positive about life, and went to see it again three days later after immediately going home to read the book. I am counting down the days until it comes out on blu-ray.
1939416019|5.0|I Really enjoyed this book very much. The main character really pulled me in and kept me wanting to know more about him. I've jumped all around the fantasy series genre looking to find new series that will pull me in like some of my other recent Favorites (The Young Ancients Series)and the one thing that both of these series have in common that made me fly through the books and crave more is the vulnerability of the main character and how they don't from the start have the confidence that a hero normally would have.  when i started this book, i almost felt like i knew what would happen from the first couple chapters, but as i kept reading i couldn't have been more wrong. i think i finished the book in the first day i picked it up and i can't wait to read the next book to find out where it goes from the great start that i believe book one supplied. I don't know if i was right about the any of the plot after the first couple paragraphs, but i'm definately gonna keep reading and can't wait to see where this story goes.<br />  This was the first book i've read from this author but will be starting another of theres to keep me occupied for the next day or two until book 2 of the sorcerer's ring comes out on kindle.
B0084B5TK8|3.0|I read it for a literature class for lifelonglearners. It will be interesting to discuss some of the issues such as euthanasia. I found the book drawn out  and repetitive. It could have been written with half the pages.
0783229372|4.0|If you took a zepplin cross country, WHY ? The acting is very good as well as the all star cast. But story line is week.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So much fun grandkids love it we can play for hours and no violence or blood good clean fun for the family
B009P5S11G|2.0|There are only about 6 or 7 songs on this album that are worth listening.  I didn't know Rihanna was a hip-hop artist.  It seems like that's the direction she's going in.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I don't like to get hooked on TV shows, but wife and I got hooked on the first episode.  Great show.  Damian Lewis is a fantastic actor, and as good as Claire Danes is, she gets even better as the season goes on.  Can't wait for season 2.
B003MWHVLY|5.0|Heard this album on a plane ride to LA. Had to buy it.  Could listen from beginning to end.  My favorite track is &#34;I'm In Here&#34;. (both versions)
0061353248|4.0|An insightful, highly readable analysis of the cognitive biases and behavioral economics that shape our lives.  And, yes, after reading the words \\"Florida,\\" \\"ancient,\\" and \\"wrinkle\\" you will walk more slowly out of a room.
B007SUW24W|5.0|Ed Sheeran is great.  Love the songs on this album and I also love his videos.  They are very creative; different from the norm.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is addictive! It is a lot of fun for kids and adults.<br />One of the best app I have downloaded.
B0091LS07E|3.0|The album is okay.  Alicia Keys is not the best singer.  People don't realize that, they get fooled by the piano.  Nothing spectacular on this album.  Girl On Fire is a cool song though.
B0089XH38M|5.0|A friend of mine suggested this product.  I am glad I chose to download it.  Love this product.  It's great.  I will recommend it to my other friends.
B002NWOOXW|5.0|Got this DVD for Christmas which made me so happy! I love you, Bridget Jones! In case it's not obvious, this is the sequel to &#34;Bridget Jones's Diary.&#34; (I've accidentally rented this when I was looking for the original.)
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book can be a life changing book.  It is easy to read and understand but also it is based on sound psychological and behavioral theory.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|One of the best adventure stories I've read, can't recommend this enough! Finished this in one weekend, but I know I'll be back to re-read it a time or twelve, enjoy!
B003JTHWJQ|1.0|I quit reading this. Like, I get it, God doesn't exist, I don't need 400 more pages to keep telling me that.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I downloaded this game to my droid and when I tried to open it for the first time I was directed to a dating site screen that would not allow you to back out of or get out of without first answering the dating service questions.  I shut down and unloaded this game from my phone.
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|I know that this is geared toward the young adult crowd and I knew that going into it. I wasn't expecting great writing here, just a Harry Potter level, dystopian future, novel. Blah...what a waste of time. The main character is such a whiney little brat that she is completely unsympathetic. Would not recommend.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is one of my favorite books ever, I have read it more than once and enjoy it every time!
B0079XPUOW|5.0|This was my first encounter with Scalzi, and I have since become an addict. In the last week or two, I've read Old Man`s War and The Last Colony, hard on the heels of Redshirts. Red shirts is definitely my favorite so far, but I'd recommend all of the above. Characters I care about, outlandish predicaments that are nevertheless within the bounds of my suspension of disbelief, and a sense of humor and irony make Redshirts  a page-turner that left me grinning. Thoroughly entertaining. I'm a new fan.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is the best book in this series and leaves you with a big cliffhanger.  I can't wait for the next book and wish it came out tomorrow!!!!!!  Rick Riordan is a fabulous author!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a riveting story that is a quick read.  It seizes the genius of children to save the world.
B006LSZECO|3.0|this was a very strange book...the ending off the wall..  don't people have to pay for their crimes any more???not a good example of justice.....
0345802934|5.0|This is my third Murakami novel and I loved it. the story, itself is very interesting but so is the way he tells it from alternating<br />characters. the detail and history he goes into with each of his characters is impressive and the worlds and settings he creates are beautiful. it is long, but it must be to understand the characters in depth. I would recommend the 3 volume set over the<br />single novel simply because its easier to hold for any length of time.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I go for movies that will entertain not history or real life.  This movie was for entertainment totally.  It was action packed, a little romance, a good ending as I recall (it's been awhile since I've seen it) and I think anyone from older teens to adults who just want to have something to let their minds be free for awhile from the stresses of life will enjoy this film.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is awesome! It works just like if you were on the computer. It's one of my faves! Definitely suggest this app to other kindle fire users!
B007UXSPK2|4.0|I don't always like Tom Cruises movies but his Mission Impossible movies have been pretty good.  If I remember correctly the last one was pretty good and I liked this one even better,  It was as always action packed but left you wondering til the end who done it and what was going to happen.  A good entertaining movie which I have said many times is why I watch movies.  I don't care for real life - I live that daily already.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I didn't really care for this facebook app. On my phone it will let you look at status' etc for as long you want to scroll down, but the app wouldn't only let me look and then it wouldn't bring up anything else. So I just started going to the web and looking at FB on there.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  It was a quick easy read.  No real surprises, however.  I would recommend this for teenagers.
B003SHUMRI|4.0|Pretty good movie...was fun watching the now married couple fall in love on screen!  The chemistry between the 2 was very apparent.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I am glad I decided to buy this book as it is another great story from an inspiring story teller.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Having been an advanced student of Metaphysics for over 25 years, I am truly amazed at this show.  Although they have fictionalized the story line for our entertainment, many of the underlying premises are truths that are not common knowledge.  I am enjoying every minute of this show and am starting on the next season and will watch it to the end.  I am very glad I invested the extra few dollars for Blue-Ray, very worth it for this show..
1449415881|5.0|compleatly unrelated, iassic Asimov is the greatest writer ever... Google the last question and read it.. great short story. word.
B009K0OL06|5.0|I have been an advanced student of Metaphysics for over 25 years, and this show is incredible.  Although they have fictionalized it for our entertainment, they use a whole lot of of underlying truths.  Very well done.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is very cool. I love playing. Pretty easy. Good graphics. Easy to learn how to play. Love love love.

B00005JOHC|5.0|We love the orginal Two and a Half Men.  It is worth the price I paid to have them to watch when ever we want.  We don't like the new one at all.
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|I might be bias because I think she always hits the mark with her songs. It is very pleasing to listen to. Her writers cracks me up with the Mr. Jesus line, even thought it is suppose to be a serious song. Overall I can see her image coming back to being a little more happy in these songs, not so dark.
B001D57C0C|5.0|WIT is the best symphonic-metal band ever.  Love this album great for head bangers and rockers.  I would recommend this album and the band to any one
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|Easy download! Like the quality of transfer and<br />fast access to it as soon as the payment is placed. I love it.
B0086700CM|5.0|This rating is becuase this game is fun!  like it a lot so no dislikes.  I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to have a little fun and some adventure
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I wish i could find more books like this. I always read book reviews wbere people &#34;couldnt put it down&#34; and finally i am one who couldn't put this down
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I've just started playing this game and it's really amazing.<br />I hope you guys would like it as much as I do. So GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AAX68HG|4.0|OveralI I really enjoy this game! Love the art style and quirky blobs of pudding. I am glad that I got the free edition instead of paying for the HD version. Great concept butvI am still waiting for About A Blob to come out!
B004WR125O|5.0|Works great - works exactly as you would expect.  Setup was easy, no issues.  Can't speak to strength as the router is around 20 feet away.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Nice program to access emails. Almost better then going to the yahoo website. I would like a &#34;Check email now &#34; button though.
B000TEUSJK|5.0|I'm not sure how accurate this movie really is...  One would hope, in this instance, that art is weirder than reality.  This movie portrays Caligula Ceasar as one sick and twisted individual.  Rate this MA for sex, violence, more sex, twisted sex, and even more twisted sex.  That being said, this was a great movie.
0553801473|5.0|Enjoyed the tv series and wanted to read the book for more.  Wow!  You get more!<br />The price was good and shipping great.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun and challenging game.  I would not buy any more levels but it was a great time killer in the hospital
0345803485|5.0|Now that I have all three books, just trying to make time to read them, at least one!  Great shipping and the price was good.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great for lesson preparation or sermon preparation and the linked notes, cross-references and dictionary links are marvelous.  Recommend it to all.
0345803507|5.0|Had to have it.  Good price, good shipping.  I still haven't had time to read it.  It would be great if you could get the time to read it along wit the book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun and challenging game.  I would not buy any more levels but it was a great time killer in the hospital.
0345803493|5.0|I wanted the trilogy.  I got all three and have not had the time to read a paragraph!  I am very satisfied with my purchase.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I gave this book a 5 because I love this series. And this book in particular is the best book in the whole series
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I'm used to the incredibly detailed narrative of Patricia Cornwell.  I like to think I've learned quite a bit about forensics.  But The Bone Bed seemed incredibly weighed down by the descriptions.  I felt like it moved at a snail's pace throughout the first 85% and wrapped up far too quickly at the end.  I had to check my Kindle's progress to learn that yes indeed, the novel was now wrapping up but the events all happened too fast and neat.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a really good game it makes u think about things. It is definitely worth having to purchase. The dominoes was a waste of time.
0765325950|1.0|The actual novel does a great job of resolving the varying story treads with a reasonably satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />My gripes all revolve around the physical book. During the first reading the binding cracked in multiple places allowing pages to fall out. The next thing is that the cover (not the book cover page which is quite nice, the actual blue 'fabric' cover) and spine disintegrated to the point where I had to use 'duct tape' just to keep it together enough to finish reading the story.  It is like they used slightly upgraded blue tissue paper binding the covers and spine together.  The glue used to hold the pages was so brittle that it repeated cracked releasing pages.<br /><br />In over 60 years of reading this was the worst manufactured book I have ever encountered!  My suggestion is to either wait for the ebook, paperback or buy the audio version. I am really sorry to see such a good book published in such a shoddy manner!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Really, wow. One of the best books I've ever read. I couldn't put it down. I'm buying the second book right away.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is fun to play and I love animals so it is perfect for me i love it and it is very fun
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This book was captivating and intriguing, some parts seeming impossible but in the end, it came together so well. I couldn't hardly put this book down.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|Husband loves music, we have seen this band (husband and wife) in concert and are never not impressed.  Great CD.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|This is a very silly, very funny flic. Not for kids, for adults who are happy suspending disbelief. Many, many laughs. I want a bear like Ted.
B000ID37T0|5.0|Daughter a big Chris O'Donnell fan and being in school still, she can appreciate this story.  Great movie, great find.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|Anne Frank was quite an exceptional young girl with a vivid imagination and flair for writing.  Her story is about several Jewish people who were forced to hide from the Nazis and live together in cramped quarters and how they coped and got along with one another for two years.  Anne Frank's narration of her daily experiences during that time in hiding was heart-warming and very sad considering the wonderful life she had lived prior to that terrible war.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Always like the &#34;who done it??? Good actors, good plot, and just plain old fun  Hope they come out with part 3.  thanks, Bill
0425252868|4.0|I like WWII books.  This story is totally fascinating and it is grippingly well written.  It is hard to believe it really happened.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|This is gettin repitisious... Like the classics and they make good gifts.  Hope to see part III at some point!, Thanks, Bill
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|If you think you saw the movie &#34;Kingdom of Heaven&#34; you haven't until you watch the Director's Cut.  It is long, but it gives you the rest of the story that you left the box office wanting.  It fills in the holes throughout so that when it is finished you feel as if you watch an entirely different movie.  Superb!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A good read. Wasn't able to put it down, though I can't help but notice a few similarities to twilight. Still a very good read.
B003F1WM2K|1.0|I don't know how this book got any awards because it is written so poorly.  I guess it succeeded because it had the name Patti Smith attached.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|fun game, worth the couple of bucks.<br />just wish they would tell you up front that the full game is not free.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|A good read.  Read it straight through on vacation.  You really feel for the main character - a social misfit that is brilliant academically. You do come away feeling a bit depressed, but again, I did enjoy it.
B005LAII3A|4.0|I still prefer the original Total Recall. But this one has its own interesting bits and pieces. The elevator, the names of the people the same. Still having the three breasted woman, other than that no other muto's. No six or eight wheeled cars. I just missed most of the crazy gadgets that where in the first total recall and also - \\"I'll be backkkk\\"
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Common sense good advice no BS! Started to see immediate results and the way Mike writes is very motivational. Highly recommend.
B003FM1MNO|5.0|recently went to the theatre to watch &#34;The Hobbit&#34; and now I'm watching the trilogy again! Can't wait to download the 3rd movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is amazing, but it wont load! I like. I like. I like! awesome. amazing. wonderful. spectacular. fantastic.!!!!! you should try it!!  its like I have a real horse! not that I don't of course!
B008NEMPTO|4.0|Again,don't let the title fool you,this isn't some cheesy low budget,poorly done vampire movie.Its done 1st class,has a very good look to it,very good acting,plenty of scary looking blood-suckers and very,very good 3D with some pop-outs.A good 3D movie to own.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Ok, why would you even pay for this? Is this really $6.99?! Dude you can go to \\"[...]\\" and get this free! All u have to do sign up (with absolutely no risks) Than search \\"minecraft pocket edition apk\\" and download! Easy and free! Hope i saved u guys some $$$!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a great movie of 4 or 5 police officers trying to do a tough job and stay in their faith.The final 5 minutes of this movie when one of the police officers stood up in his church and called for all fathers to stand up and be fathers was one of the most moving,inspirational speeches i've ever heard in my life.I have a good relationship with all my grown kids and we speak often,but after watching this film I was moved to call them the next morning and again,tell them I love them and ask about their well being. If your in the faith,have children,or just want to watch a great inspirational film..this is it !!! At least watch the final 5-10 minutes and hear  one of the greatest inspirational,motivating speeches in movie history !!!
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my little sister and it is exactly what I expected and what she wanted. As always, money well spent with Amazon.
B006H5120E|5.0|When I first saw this movie many moons ago I wasn't impressed.To much of a chick flick I thought,I'm not much of a romance film guy.Then I started reading the 3D reviews from you good people and I said \\"hey,why not\\" as I'm always looking for good 3D.Well man,have I changed my mind!The 3D was great,can't believe it was a transfer,but you guys know more about that tech stuff than I do(i.e,what company does better transfers,etc),I just watch 'em and rate them..lol ! What I didn't expect was a added bonus..the Titanic is a great,great movie !! For every guy who dreamed of being a hero to the woman he loved..this is the movie,for every guy who dreamed of the woman he loved to go beyond proving her love for him.i.e pushing aside wealth,disobeying her mom,rescuing him from drowning,jumping back on a sinking ship that he was on when she was safely on a lifeboat going to safety JUST TO BE WITH HIM,this is it !!! This is one of those \\"WOW\\" movies I sometimes talk about when I describe the emotions some of us feel when we're finished watching a great film. Adventure,action,a great romance,and great 3D,this movie has it all.A must add to any 3D collection !! WOW !!!!
B000W1ZEH6|4.0|If you like rainbow then you should like this one. Good production good songs great guitar playing. Not the best rainbow album but worth buying.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was an interesting trilogy.  I would like to here his side of the story since he's so screwed up in the begining.  On a scale of 1 to 10 it was an 8
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Although I have seen the movie several times, I had not read the book. When I received my new Kindle, I decided to try out some classics. I'm glad &#34;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&#34; was the first. It took a short time to read and was utterly delightful. The words conjure up fantastic scenes and bring Dorothy and her friends to life. The movie followed the book's storyline, but the book is more well rounded. I'm sure it's a wonderful book for children, but even as an adult I enjoyed it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was an interesting trilogy.  I would like to here his side of the story since he's so screwed up in the begining.  On a scale of 1 to 10 it was an 8

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is addictive! Starts out easy & progressively becomes more difficult. Good for children & adults. Try this game and sharpen your puzzle-solving skills.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|Wow! Great Product! Will be back for more!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|For a Kindle game it's actually pretty good. I think the waiting times will get irritating the longer I play it though. but that's all if these app games.

B003NX76BM|5.0|Love Simon's strange way of showing his deep love for Fiona! A wonderful story of man's best friend with a twist of love an  murder.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|This application shows everything one needs to know about the use of their kindle in reference to their power consumption and applications, reading, and web searches.
0399160450|4.0|Tom Clancy writes great stories and I am a great fan. I really like the way his books keep adding to the series without skipping necessary details. However, this book is very long and seems to be slow getting started and in some places the characters seem to pop in and out. I think that in time I will probably change my mind, but right now this book is a hard read. Usually I have trouble putting his books down, but it is taking a lot to read more than a couple of pages before my attention waivers.<br /><br />I hope his next book will be as exciting as his previous stories, but not so detailed and long as this book.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I would never have watched this unless it had been referred to me - it was awesome. Hilarious and very well done - not what you would expect at all. Worth the rental for sure.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|dont wast your money and i have to write this just to make up the word requirement ta da da
B004SCI9BS|4.0|An excellent album. Song for song, not quite as strong as &#34;Is This It&#34;, but still many signs that The Strokes still have the magic that went into that album. More electronic influence than in their earlier music, but still true to their garage rock roots.
B00333IA1M|2.0|This is a great book and it showed up in a timely manner, however, the cover was different than shown on the order and not in great shape.
0765331152|5.0|I won't lie to you-- I'm glad Robert Jordan died and passed the series onto such a capable author. Amazing book, loved it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game (; it's very good  p.s (it's worth all the money )and if you like building this is the game for you
0385536828|2.0|I've enjoyed McEwan's novels in the past \\"Atonement\\" being the best, and I have to say \\"Sweet Tooth\\" being the least satisfying. I think my main complaint was the storyline/plot which seemed forced and wasn't really that interesting to this reader. I couldn't get into Serena's trials and tribulations because she wasn't drawn out to be a troubled symphathetic character, unlike Briony in \\"Atonement\\".
0007229739|5.0|Slow at first but then you get into it and it gets very good. Michael Crichton is a very good writter
B00992CF6W|5.0|my only thing is that can someone tell me how to buy this it just says &quot; error&quot; so can someone tell me how to get an amazon cards money on your kindle fire
B00AMBH70S|4.0|The film was action packed and Jeremy Renner played his part well.  The main character was not portrayed as a replacement for the Matt Damon character; Jeremy Renner's character was a continuation of the Bourne conspiracy. I Would watch it again.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|mindless and additive. great to play while watching football. don't really understand the experience points thing but play just the same
1439156816|4.0|On Writing by Stephen King is a different book from most I have read on the subject of writing. In addition to being instructional, this book could be considered an autobiography.  The book is comprised of three sections:  King's early years, his writing life and his advice on writing.<br /> King's love of writing began by copying comic books and writing adapted commentary at the tender age of five. His mother loved his stories and would always compliment him on them. At that time, King sold his first four books; his mother had bought them all and gave them to her friends.<br /> In school, King was given a writing assignment and, as one might expect, he wrote a horror story. His teacher was appalled by the graphic nature of the story and expressed her discontent. She told him what he had written was junk and, with his God-given talent, he could do better. King was crushed at her rebuke and struggled with a belief that he was not suited to write. He attended high school and took every writing class available. After high school, he entered college and studied English. It was during this time, in a poetry class, he met his wife.<br /> At the onset of their marriage, King taught English during the day, wrote at night, and faithfully received rejection letters on a daily basis. He struggled to support his family and as it increased in size; he became more frustrated with each notice of rejection. At this point, King had written a novel, Carrie.  He submitted proposals to various publishing companies, and in turn, they rejected him many times over. He was furious. Out of frustration, he threw the manuscript in the wastebasket.<br /> His wife had read the manuscript and she believed someone would publish it, so she took it and mailed it off to the publishers. A while later, not only did he receive an acceptance letter, but also a $2,500 advance check. After less than a year, he received $400,000 for the paperback sales of Carrie and had agreed to a movie deal. That was thebeginning of King's remarkable career.  He continued writing and many of his novels have been transformed into films. The list includes well known movies like The Clown and Misery.<br />  After describing his early life and the genesis of his writing career, King shares what he believes to be his major pitfall: his addiction to alcohol and drugs. He cautions that many writers fall to these vices; they tend to believe they are better writers and their ideas flow more naturally under the influence of their favorite substances. King warns his fellow writers that \\"it's all a farce.\\"<br /> Stephen King explains his views on writing and the life of a writer quite candidly. He believes taking writing classes and workshops will not teach a person to write. Instead, he encourages writers to write daily in order to train in efficiency while trying to earn a living. He suggests to novice writers they should write at least one thousand words per day, eventually aiming for a goal of two thousand words per day. He calculates that, when writing one thousand words a day, a writer can draft a complete book in six months. Writing two thousand words every day can generate a draft in three months; an admirable completion timeframe in the publishing world.<br /> King agrees with author Natalie Goldberg as she encourages in her book, Bare Bones, authors should write the bare bones; she sees this as the unadulterated truth of writing. King uses real events and expands on them as fiction. He gives writers tips on basic writing practices like the use of adverbs.  King says that adverbs are for boring people, and that they slow down the pace of the narrative action. In addition, the use of passive voice does so similarly; he urges writers to use the active voice for excitement and pacing.<br />  King authored this book to inspire writers and inform them of what they will face in the world of publishing.  Nevertheless, he urges them to keep going and to keep writing. King wrote this book forwriters. He gives pointers that can be used for veteran writers, however, this book's primary benefit is for the novice writer.<br /> Throughout the book King shares the joys and passion he experiences in writing. He reminds the reader that the compensation is usually very small in the beginning; sometimes the compensation is so small that writers must be gainfully employed while they write.  He tells us to write out of love for the craft and that money will come as a result.<br /><br />Book Reviewer:Diane Williams, author of: [ASIN:B008VWLBN4 Angels in Action]]:12 stories to inspire.
B00992CF6W|2.0|It's a fun game, but as a word of warning, you can't host a game using the Kindle Fire. My Asus Transformer can, and I can join the game with the Kindle, but for whatever reason the Fire can't even though it is running the exact same version of the game.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I loved all the songs not just one or two.. Like in most cases......can't wait for the part 2 movie to come
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My daughter wanted to get some games for her kindle fire and she love this game.<br /><br />Review by 11 year old:<br /> This game is like having a real pet. It shows your parents how responsible you are.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|loved the movie think its a great lvoe story..... I would have done the same as bella wish life was like the movies I have found my true love
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very informative and easy to read and I like the fact that I can listen to it too. ENJOY THE WORD.
B002BWP49C|5.0|great , you can see she is scared till she see Edward and then she knows that its the right thing and the best thing to do. SHe knows how much she loves him.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Its always nice to watch a movie that isn't based on a sequel or remake of an older movie. This movie was pretty good. I will say the CG on Joseph Gordon-Levitt felt a little goofy/unnecessary to me, but it didn't really detract from the movie.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|love the music , I can remember every part of the movie with each song. Love this love story..... Love edwar and Bella together
B009MF56GC|5.0|This movie is great. Isaw it twice already and will watch it again. I love this movie and highly recommend it to everyone. Awesome movie.
B004AUHWLQ|4.0|This isn't a laugh a minute movie with slapstick humor.  It's very subtle about an average guy who managed to get himself into being taken advantage of some big wheels where he works.  Great acting all around.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Cool story brought up-to-date and depicts a mostly believable, if bleak, future where the Judges are needed.  Should have been longer, though.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|My family and i love these shows so i have bought the dvds as presents.  If you are into mystery, action, and some quick witted humor, then these shows are must see tv.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|this book captured me from the very beginning.  I loved the way the author used the meaning of flowers in expressing the feelings of the main character.  This book was very emotional and difficult to read at times but hopeful and inspiring as well.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Yes, the album cover is very fitting for this album.  It's relentless, in your face, signature Van Halen.  It's like the 28 years between this and the last Roth album never even happened.  High quality songs, kickass guitar, no keyboard ballads, what else can I say?  I hope these guys can stick around to make at least a few more albums like this.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't put it down! All I wanted to do when I did was pick it back up and putting it back down was the hardest thing...
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|This book was definitely a fun rom-com that grabbed my attention from the start. I would have given it 5 stars but the repetition of &#34;God's blood&#34; (and other variations of this) started getting a little annoying. Definitely not the typical 'vampire falls in love with human' scenario
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this game lets u take responsibility. as park ranger as u go along in the game u get more and more Dp and get more and more animals sea creatures are coming soon some items must be purchased with real money other than that just have a zoopendist time
B00992CF6W|5.0|Probably one of the best apps for a Kindle Fire. Longtime fans of the game may not be impressed but If you like minecraft for the computer or xbox360 you should definately get this game. 7 bucks is a bit much for a game but this is definetely a miniature world in your pocket. There is survival for the ones who want the real deal and there is creative for the curious minds. Overall a start of a new era for mobile apps and block story should be ashamed.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was as good as I expected it to be. I couldn't wait to begin reading. I recommend this to everyone.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Great story line,love the way the author goes from past to present to tie everything in.The secret Keeper is the third book by same author that I've  read.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|i loved this game. it has great graphics and story line. need more games like this one. this is one of the better g5 games lately.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so cool now I can bring it over to some of my friends houses and create an entire world!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good book. Some parts were not required, but overall I enjoyed it. I will continue to read the next book.
B008N2Z1L0|4.0|\\"Bringing Down the Horse\\" will probably always have my favorite Wallflowers songs on it.  \\"Red Letter Days\\" is definitely my favorite album by them, infused with a manic energy and an urgency not normally experienced in their rootsy, bluesy, and usually cathartic music.  \\"Rebel Sweetheart\\" didn't hook me but I can still listen to it and it will feel fresh and offer interest.  \\"Breach\\" left me completely cold.  So where does \\"Glad All Over\\" fall in their stock of albums for me?  As a pretty solid outing probably falling just behind \\"Bringing Down the Horse\\".  GAO may be best described as a blending of \\"Rebel\\" & \\"Red\\", but the songs have a more cohesive flow and feel generally tighter than they did on \\"Rebel\\".  The tempos are mostly up and so is the psychology of the album and there is a strong undercurrent of country and roots rock flavor (especially reinforced by the pedal steel guitar, organ, and wurlitzer).  Dylan's straight-to-the-heart by way of sympathetic and easy to connect to events infused with a spiritual, God inclusive consciousness may make this a less poetic adventure but definitely helps connect us to the characters and moments that inhabit these songs and make us feel like we're along for the ride (see especially \\"First One In the Car\\", \\"Have Mercy On Him Now\\", & \\"Hospital For Sinners\\").  The title of this album, \\"Glad All Over\\", is truth in advertising as there is a generalized atmosphere of smoke and hope; the pathos as especially seen on \\"Bringing Down the Horse\\" or the nervous anxiousness as displayed on \\"Red Letter Days\\" is largely absent here though it manages more energy IMO than any of their other albums with the exception of \\"Red\\".<br /><br />As a person who doesn't generally go for bluesy, rootsy music I still find myself drawn to and enjoying the Wallflowers.  I love Dylan's voice and delivery, and the soul he infuses the songs with.  Good, solid songs showcased here that will make you glad you listened.
B000021Y7X|4.0|All of David Byrne's best songs!  This DVD is fun to watch and makes great background music.  I only wish there was a CD version I could buy with all the same songs.
B000002QWD|3.0|Another reviewer has suggested that Christmas just doesn't feel like Christmas unless you can hear some of Crosby's Christmas tunes and I dig that sentiment.  There are some real chestnuts on this collection from the eponymous \\"White Christmas\\" to \\"It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas\\" and they contain Bing's customary magic.  But I have to dock this disc for its sound quality.  The music and female vocals (mostly The Andrews Sisters) have a tinny element to them and, maybe I'm mistaken, but the songs sound like they're all mono.  I've listened to this through a variety of formats (and speakers) and the tinniness is frequently distracting unfortunately.  I wouldn't expect this with anything re-released within the last 20 years.  For song selection and Bing's thrumming warm vocals I give this 4 stars.  For sound quality 2.5.<br /><br />I'm going to assume that there are far better Bing Christmas recordings out there.  I'd suggest that buyers check those out.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Really enjoyed it.  Characters are so realistic and the story telling wants you to just keep reading and reading.  I recommended it to a friend of mine who had also read her third book.
B0000042MY|5.0|My wife walked down the aisle to the music on \\"Promentory\\" and so much of our main wedding service's music was packed with tracks off of \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" soundtrack.  And I know that we are not alone.  Many people have used the wonderful, lush, and romantic music from this movie as performances during weddings.<br /><br />Words so often fail to describe music but that's what we're left with here.  The Mohicans is lush, elegant, galloping, romantic, elegiac, determined, thrilling, hopeful, intense, and finally, somber at times.<br /><br />This music takes my wife and I back to one of the happiest days of our lives.  It also provides us with enjoyable relaxing moments (great to drift asleep to) as well as...other enjoyable moments where we don't sleep so much.  It's great music for a variety of moods.<br /><br />If you haven't discovered this yet do yourself a favor and take the plunge.  Well worth it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great graphics and a fairly realistic gameplay. Got it on a whim and totally worth it. Great and fun for kids.
B002N57KG2|5.0|Funnt entertaining movie. A must see! If you were around during the times of these actors you will enjoy this movie. Lots of laughs and good memories.
B008602KQI|5.0|best movie ever.. I read the book and the movie was great. Cant wait for catching fire to come out.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I laughed when i first seen this movie. But now its like a cult movie! I grew up in the 80's with this music. I can say the arraingments of songs was performed perfect. I have my 16 year old listening and watching the movie with me. Very enjoyable.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was incredible with amazing detail. I could see every single word in my head and watch it play out. This series is truly something spectacular.
B0091REZMW|4.0|good game. can be alittle confusing at times. only thing it takes money to get more energy should b a way to get energy without using real money
B00992CF6W|4.0|Warning: skin change does not work!<br /><br />I loved this app.  Then when I tried to change the skin, it said &quot;unauthorized request&quot; and mine craft no longer opens.... please fix!  I love this game!
B006ZNRD06|5.0|Only been running for 2 days on my Kindle Fire, but works great for streaming movies from my PC via TVersity once the screenshot option was unchecked (annoying).<br /><br />Unlocker a little overpriced, but works great.
B003Q6D1YW|5.0|Fantastic movie! It is so greatly prices it felt like a steal! I would highly highly highly suggest this purchase!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a fabulous book with real life lessons that will appeal to all ages.  Parents could read it with their elementary school aged children.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I'm addicted.  I love how some of the actors from season 1 are also in season 2.  Can't wait for season 3.
B00B19DMUE|3.0|The movie was Average nothing special but not bad... it was entertaining kind of scary but I. Felt like I saw it before even though I  didn't
B0063IH60K|5.0|This a straight forward Solitaire game which helps me relax and not use my mind as much. I also like it to pass the time away while waiting for something at an office.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|A look back into another time and thus another world, but with sentiments that are still relevant in the world of love.  The style of writing in this book flows wonderfully to make you feel as though you were being told the story first hand. The representation of love and the spitefulness it can create is powerful an romantic.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Awesome adaptation of Phillip K. Dick's short story. Cool premise, great effects, and very different from the 1980s version. Worth watching.
B000000OU0|5.0|Great CD! One of my all time favorites.  I never get tired of listening to this Cd?  I wore my other one out.
0374530718|4.0|\\"Sophia's World\\" is an above-average novel embedded with a great introduction to Western philosophy. The plot revolves around Sophia, a young Norwegian teenager who lives in a small town. Just before her fifteen birthday, she starts receiving mysterious letters, which make her ponder the most deep, yet unanswerable, questions, such as: \\"what is the meaning of life\\" and \\"who she is.\\" Sophia's world is not a great novel; however, it does a remarkable job of making philosophy very accessible for the uninitiated, presenting it in a more enjoyable and less dry way compared to the other philosophy introduction books out there.
B004ZN9RWK|2.0|Sound quality is very bad.  Sounds very muffled.  Maybe it's a bootleg CD?  Not sure, but not a good Cd.  :(. Very disapointed
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Finding himself in another circumstantial pickle, Reacher is calm and controlled as usual. Another page turning book that kept me up at night to finish on day two. Well written and thoroughly detailed. On to book 3!
0763644765|5.0|I love how simple and easy to understand this book is for toddlers.  I will look into purchasing more of Leslie Patricelli's boks.  My son LOVES to &#34;read&#34; it and easily understands the drawings of where it is appropriate to go potty (in the toilet,  not diaper!).
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I rented this movie after being told it was hilarious. I just didn't find it very funny. I love Family Guy so my hopes were high... maybe too high. I was disappointed.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I thought this book was sad, sweet and really enjoyed the characters.  I like how the characters make you understand and feel their pain.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A very good book!I loved the format it was in and even though I really want to know who Charlie is writing to I still like the mystery. The book made me sad but happy at the same time. Can't wait to see the movie
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not stop reading this book....loved the characters and miss them already.  For me, it's one of those books I'm just sad is done....really enjoyed it!
B009CCBCU4|4.0|This book was a slow starter but after it took off it was a very good read.  Also had some ancient history and customs that were also interesting.
1118232658|5.0|From small to large, any business owner needs to read Socialnomics! Until reading Qualman's book, I wasn't aware of the impact that social media sites could have. I've finally started to set-up a facebook account, and to further leverage the LinkedIn account that I've neglected!
0525952926|5.0|After having read Book One &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; I couldn't wait for Book Two. It did not let me down. It was just as good if not better than the first.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Another great product from Smith's. It's inexpensive, but gets the job done. I had an old knife that had lost its edge and was able to put a new edge on it. Another thing i like about it is how compact it is. It's smaller than my knife, so throwing it in a bag to bring along doesn't take up much weight or space.  Great product for a great price.
B0045NXMJE|2.0|I got lost.  Then fell asleep. After awhile I woke up and then shut the durn thing off and went back to sleep.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|None Of the products will load that i download from this site. I do not think i will use this site again.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Bruno Mars is so talented! The whole album is fun, entertaining and sexy. I love it! Modern day Michael Jackson :-)
0307719774|5.0|I started this book on Jan. 1 of this year. So far, the questions will be interesting to look back on in a few years. I love the idea of this book and it's wonderfully bound and made to last. I'm very happy with this purchase. Couldn't have asked for more. I would definately recommend this book to anyone who is interested in how their life changes day-by-day or is interested in journaling. It's a lovely start to both! Couldn't say enough about this book. Definately one of my favorite purchases from Amazon.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. It is a lot of fun and I have trouble putting it down when I am playing it. The only thing I don't like about it is the ads that pop up when you go to play it.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|A Storm of Swords - am now reading - great reading - alot of characters to remember - things do not go as expected
B00A757EFW|5.0|This is a fun game and I really like it but I find it hard to maneuver on my kindle fire.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|It  was a great book like the second book anf the third. alot of jumping from one King, children and Knights
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Easily one of my top 5 favorite books of all time. I laughed and cried and was so moved by the story. It is beautifully written and will touch your heart and soul deeply. I cannot stop thinking about the characters after finishing the book. You HAVE to read it!
B004MC8CA2|2.0|Hard to use has some nice features,but awkward to move around in. Not much reference ability. Not what I expected.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I didn't buy into the zombie fad but this is something different. This show is all about the characters not necessarily the setting. You live the tension, pain, confusion, and despair of each moment through each character. The performances are griping and constantly keep you asking &#34;What would I do if I were there? How would I survive? How would I cope&#34; I am so drawn in. I can't wait til February 10.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|this app is fun...WHEN IT WORKS!!!!!! I've only gotten this to work once and so I don't like it!!!!!!don't get this app
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|the game is fun but they could work on the gameplay against the cpu because they tag team you even if your a level 1 and there each like level 7 and also they'll retreat if they get hurt
B000FA5TTW|5.0|Oh my! I loved it! Best book I've.ever read.I totally recommend this to everyone . Best read. Now, I watch the movie
B00001OH1S|5.0|I saw the original movie with my (then) girlfriend and was very taken with the movie and the featured song (Windmills Of Your Mind). Beautiful music then and now. The remake of the movie was a minor disappointment for me because it didn't follow the original as much as I'd have liked. The characters that replaced the original just didn't quite get there for me either, but the Music was way more of a feature and with Sting singing the Windmills Of Your Mind, it made my day! I didn't realize how much I enjoyed the song but upun seeing the movie again I realized just how good it is!
B005HSL626|5.0|Fruit ninja is just plain awesome. one time I was playing it on my friends phone and she couldn't beat my score!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0076DELIG|4.0|I enjoyed this latest book of Michael Connelly.  It is probably not his best work, but I liked the plot, and I like the character of Harry Bosch.  Harry is getting a little old...
0385536828|3.0|Ian McEwan does a fine job of placing the reader back in the U.K. circa the early 1970's for the saga of Serena Frome.  Serena was recruited for the spy game and her time with MI-5 is less than engaging until she is put on the mission with code name of Sweet Tooth.<br /><br />Serena is to go undercover and get close to an aspiring author named Tom Haley.  Haley is not much of a writer, but he is of particular interest to Her Majesty's Secret Service and Frome is the perfect candidte to reel him in.  The two quickly become lovers and Serena also becomes the first reader (muse?) for Haley's short stories.  Although the stories do not really say much, Serena realizes there is something else there.<br /><br />As she gets deeper and deeper into her mission, the fine lines between fact and fiction, reality and con game get severely blurred and Serena may very well be the unwitting pawn in a spy game she is totally outmatched by.  Witty and full of intrigue and a deep look into the art of fiction writing, SWEET TOOTH will impress regular McEwan fans but comes no where near his classic prior works like ATONEMENT and ENDURING LOVE.
B008MILL9G|5.0|It is 3 good movies all for one great low price and to have them all on bluray is great it is such a great deal.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|One of the best movies ever made in one of the most impressive box set produced. The film is bright, colorful, and produced with a great surround sound track. The extra in the boxed set are well worth the price paid. Excellent!
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Had to delete and then reinstall before it worked on my device. As far as I can tell it has a cleaner look than the previous version. The sound is slightly crisper with some radio stations as well. One of my favorite apps to use on the Kindle Fire.
B007JVJ3C4|3.0|Very lame movie, but ok 3-D effects. Purchase this on sale to show off your 3-D TV and sound system. I think this film was made in Turkey, which should tell the viewer a lot.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This was a great book! Many classics do not deserve that title, but this is definitely not one of them.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This book is so good I'm just stunned. Just finished and wanted to write the review immediately. Thank goodness the story will continue, and although the next one is not out yet I don't care. I need time to think about what I've just read. It's overwhelming.<br /><br />While looking for something new and good to read, I saw that this book had five stars even though there were 657 reviews. Even LOTR isn't that highly rated! Then I read the synopsis and saw that the recommendation for the book was written by none other than Michael J. Sullivan, author of the incomparable Riyria Revelations trilogy, the best epic fantasy I've read in years. That clinched it for me. And now I'm done with this amazing book that is a masterpiece of the genre.<br /><br />The good news is that Anthony Ryan says he's quit his day job to write full time. The other good news is that he's done with book two so it won't be long to wait. In the meantime I'm starting on his other book, part three of which is available on Amazon, check his author's page.<br /><br />Thank you very much for this book, Anthony. As Michael Sullivan says, you are truly a master storyteller.
B000HAB4KS|1.0|The Matrix takes on a future world where mind experiences are induced by software, not the senses.  This premise ought to have been fascinating, but this very Hollywood treatment is nothing but an old fashioned shoot-em-up, with silly kung fu fights, hilarious logical inconsistencies, and a cinematic superhero who, true to formula, finds his magical powers just in time.  Ho hum.  Skip this one unless you like assault rifles discharging ammo by the bushel.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My granddaughter and I loved this movie and have watched it over and over again. We recommend it to anyone who loves animation.
B004U52VPS|2.0|This was on my 10-year-old's Christmas list.  She liked it at first, but soon became frustrated.<br />It is tediouse trying to build the structures shown on the level cards sometimes. They are supposed to be grouped according to difficulty, but some of the Level 1 structures are just as difficult as the Level 2 and 3 ones.<br />I expected higher quality wood pieces,  but it is all plastic.  I guess that is so they can be weighted perfectly, but some of the structures seem impossible, as is the ability to control the direction of the catapult.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Many references to the original film with Schwartzeneger, but the characters here are a little bland. The last half of the film seems rushed, and you really don't connect enough with the characters to care.
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|Interesting maze concepts. With addition of cat the game gets more difficult quickly. A person knows the pattern required but to get past that darn cat!!!!
0783222149|4.0|This is a really great action packed, drama filled thriller! Meryl Streep and Kevin Bacon are both wonderful in it!  Kevin Bacon, especially!  It had me on the edge of my seat quite a few times and I've even seen it before!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Oh, Hopeless... where do I start with my review of Hopeless. This was a very deep and dark read with twists and turns that had you gasping aaaaand then  crying. Yeah guys, this one was pretty upsetting in a number of ways. I read it and I'm still processing how I feel.<br /><br />I'm going to give you the tagline from the book as the synopsis. Of course you can go on Goodreads and read what it's about, but I don't think that's an accurate or fair depiction of what you'll read.<br /><br />Sometimes discovering the truth can leave you more hopeless than the lies...<br /><br />Sounds ominous, right? Yeah you're nervous about what the big mystery is. And I guess that's the biggest strenght of Hopeless. You go into the story thinking it's your typical NA romance where an innocent, homeschooled girl meets the bad boy in town and they fall in love. But it is so much more than that. Readers begin knowing very little about the characters and plot and come out with an explosion of information, intrigue and a hefty dose of reality.<br /><br />Hopeless as a whole is not about Sky and Holder's romance. It's about Sky's reality, or lack thereof. Their relationship is strong and Holder's guidance, insight and support help Sky through a whirlwind of truths that lead her down a path to discover who she is and where she came from. She's left at the end of the journey to discover for herself, what her future holds.<br /><br />I know, I know I'm being way too cryptic and you really have no idea what the books about but really I can't go into much more detail. Your world will  be rocked when you see the depth at which this book reads. You will quite literally fall down the rabbit hole as Sky's world is turned upside down with the knowledge that her life is a lie.<br /><br />The romance is heartwarming, the story is eye opening and you're left at the end wondering \\"What in the world would I do if I were in Sky's place?\\"<br /><br />Not my most informative review yet, but if this review gets even one person to pick up Hopeless just to see what the mystery is about, I've done my job. It's a book worth reading, but make sure you have a few hours and some tissues to spare  because you won't want to put Hopeless down once you pick it up.<br /><br />8 out of 10<br /><br />Happy Reading :)ts even one person to pick up Hopeless just to see what the mystery is about, I've done my job. It's a book worth reading, but make sure you have a few hours and some tissues to spare  because you won't want to put Hopeless down once you pick it up.<br /><br />8 out of 10<br /><br />Happy Reading :)
B0001V6ZJ8|4.0|I like this original version of Moulin Rouge much better than the newer one with Nicole Kidman in it.  Sometimes the re-makes just aren't as good as the originals.......If you've seen the newer version of it, try renting this version and compare them for yourself.  I recommend it!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Good story... very spot on for the character Bosch.  Glad he's trying to be a better dad.  Also like his developing relationship with his partner - considering how different they are.  I wonder if Connelly will give us a new series starring the IA Detective Mendenhall?
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|*no major spoilers*<br /><br />I was not a huge fan of the first two movies.  The first one was good, second was pretty blah.  I went in to watching this with zero expectations.  I was not expecting to be entertained because sequels and the like usually suck.<br /><br />However, I was pleasantly surprised at how engaging and well written the storyline was.  I was not rolling on the floor laughing, but I was interested in what was going on.  Right before they meet Griffin I was started to lose interest and started to doze off, but it picked up after that.<br /><br />I was immensely surprised and I would watch it again, which is more than I can say for the second one.  Still not sure if I understood the chocolate milk thing and almost falling asleep somewhere in the middle where it slowed a little was why I only gave it four stars, but all in all I thought it was worth watching and I would recommend it to a friend.
B00ANT6OK8|1.0|This is a very negative and long movie that makes it also very boring.<br />It's all about torture, murder, explosions,... all the bad things you can think of.<br />Also the female CIA agent in this movie, apparently has got something up her you know what and has a very bad attitude from the beginning through the end of the film.<br /><br />This could have been a better fit if you watch it as a TV documentary in a program like CBS 60 minutes, but to pay for the ticket and watch it in a movie theater is a big big mistake.<br /><br />I want my money and those 3 hours back.
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|Fun game good graphics! Would recommend to others. It has good action and plenty of tasks with a good story line.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|LOVE THIS APP! Littlest Pet Shops are a great toy, and now they even have their own app! This app is very fun! The graphics are soo good and 3D as well! The mini games are pretty good and I look forward to getting new pets. The only thing I don't like is: like I said, the mini games are pretty good, but sometimes you have to wait 20 or more minutes to play the mini game again.But this app is very good, plus it's FREE!!!!!
B000GX0QNM|5.0|I have this in a display with other model aircraft showing how man learned to fly. The Wright flyer is at the bottom and the SR-71 Blackbird is at the top, and this model is in between. Looks good I'll send a photo when I have finished it. Thanks again Amazon good work and keep it up.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not as awesome as the first two books but a great trilogy!  I'd recommend it to anyone. I got lost in it and really I kinda encourage to read this if you're going through depression. In a funny way it helped me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is amazing. The horse reacts to your touch Everyone who loves horses needs this game it is also free too
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is really fun it takes real time to cook things and you can totally play without purchasing diamonds I would definently getcit even if it were a buck but my brother and I can play together even tho he is on apple and I'm on an android get this game folks :)
B0076HNCTQ|4.0|I got the pilot of the show because I was reminded by Sloane Crosley in her book &#34;I was told there would be cake&#34; , her family watched it religiously and found it very funny.  I love the clothes, the hair,the dialogue,the setting everything!  and I'll be buying the whole series.  I recommended it to several friends.  Amazon's breadth of selections is wonderful.  I don't mind paying for the occasional series or movie, the price is right!
B009CPE424|5.0|this little movie was cute and grandkids loved it too.<br />I hope they continue to make more like it for kids
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This is quite interesting game and it is an endurance game (meaning one continues to level over time based on choices made in game (some taking hours /days)).  One dies not simply finish such as one would on gaming system type platform game.  There are updates and many animals to obtain.  This is a community game in that having neighbors helps - but there is no seeming community contact (message walls).<br /><br />It takes very little time to get through several levels and the zoo can become quite beautiful with thought and perserverance.  A nice thing is that this game does not \\"expire \\" animals if you do not come back in allotted time as some games (pet story) do.  You can go and your baby animal will be waiting and not too ill to recover.<br /><br />You need check often as some money generators take only a short time and do not compound the funds over time.  You hit Max at timer point and then it sits - since the kiosks at lower levels do not generate much - this is a bit of a drawback.  Same with animal collection.  They are single unit payoutz and do not accumulate at hourly (or whatever) rate to give you a fairly good layout after sleeping like other games (dream zoo - zoo story, etc.).<br /><br />The big drawback for kindle users is that one cannot exit game via menu option or with calling up \\"home \\" on kindle.  You are required to manually shut off kindle to exit since the little buttons on bottom of screen are inaccessable with this game.<br /><br />Cute game overall.<br /><br />Christine
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|too much bad language and ugly and dark content, waiting for some more family oriented movies for our family to watch
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|She always used to beg to play it on my husband's phone until I put it on her Kindle for her. Now she can play all she wants to. We had some issues when it stopped working and I had to delete it, but I re-installed it and it seems to be fine now. Hopefully won't have to do that again!
B00APUQT7I|5.0|we are looking forward to another sequel and see what happens to the little squirrel or what ever he it
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|My daughter loves this game. The only problem so far is that all she wants to do is feed them!

B003VANOFY|3.0|Very clear sound, the only problem its not loud enough like turtle beach headphones...everything else is perfect very crisp and clear...
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Such a funny but intelligent book.  I expected the book to be funny, but did not expect how it would make me feel proud to be a woman.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I have used this for quite some time now, and it's holding up very well. My only complaint is that it only has a shallow little space for the stand to fold into, and it slips out easily. Otherwise, I like everything else about it.
B001FB55I0|5.0|This is whirlwind movie with plenty of action and surprises. Time is no longer an issue if you think this movie can change anything in our time line. Arnald can do no wrong here in this Action Packed Adventure of the Future meeting up with Present. See it in 7.1 Surround Sound and you will flip. The whole room come alive. So hang on to butt and try not to kiss it good by. Because this movie may change the way you used to look at building things.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Darts out a little slow, but it picks up and has you yearning for the sequels.  Looking forward to book 2
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|The was a good movie And it was so cool to watch great movie going to watch it again and again
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed watching this superb series. A wholesome film for all the family. Great acting .And I highly recommend.
B0002858YS|5.0|One of the best CDs of all time. This was the debut project for the Killers, and its amazing. Every track is on-point from start to finish. The rest of their music is good including &#34;Battleborn&#34;, but this is their best. Their music crosses different genres and time. The Killers are simply very talented.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I found this book to be an eazy read and enjoyed it from begining to end. Safe Haven is a book that anyone can enjoyreading
B008P76VP8|5.0|The St. Mathew Passion by J.S. Bach could easily rank as one of the most awesome works of music ever written--2 hours and 40 minutes of great music by not 1 but 2 orchestras and chorus creating quite a spectacle.<br />  The new BluRay DVD by the St. Thomas Choir of Leipzig, an 800 year old institution that Bach himself graduated from, is both daring and eloquent and yet very true to the style of the period.<br />  One bold departure from the traditional voicing of the work is the performance of Stefan Kahle, a male alto singing a part traditionally sung by a woman.  A highly disciplined performer, Kahle renders every solo with an eloquence and beauty I have never heard in any previous performances. This is especially true in the exquisite duo for violin and alto: Erbarme dich, mein gott.  Backed by a superb violinist, this aria is breathtaking.  I highly recommend this.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am in love with Pinterest. I have it on my personal laptop, iPhone and now on my kindle fire. Pinterest never disappoints! On all three systems it is just as easy and fun to navigate through all the wonderful ideas and pictures.
B005EI86JU|5.0|Good book,all you need to know about using the D7000<br />Mr Young has laid every thing out in a simple, easy to read<br />manner.
B00006LFGD|4.0|It will be added to my CD folder I keep in my car.  I only wish the CD contained more of her more popular duets.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome it never blurs but it sometimes freezes. So I would reccomend it to any one who loves horses!
B005K0HDGE|2.0|I have read most of Stephen King's &#34;Reacher&#34; books.  This one did not measure up.  I did not finish it.
1481251880|5.0|I could not put this book down. I started it at 5:00 am and finished it at 5:15 pm. Loved it!
B00003CXDD|2.0|Wait a long time for this order to be filled.  When received, it was obviously not a NEW copy (as I had paid for) as there was no seal on the DVD case and fingerprints on the DVD itself.  Also, the case had sticky residue on the top of it.<br /><br />Contacted GoHastings.  Took them a while to respond.  While they offered to accept a return, they could not replace the DVD.  Since this was a Christmas gift to our daughter, she decided to keep it.<br /><br />All in all, still not happy.  Would think twice about ordering from this company again.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|The writing of the movie - especially in the early going - was poor.  The writers played up the ego issues too much and made the characters too immature.  At the end, the heros are able to survive too much against too many.  Could have made all more credible by using the threat of what was coming before the miraculous conclusion.  Keep the action but keep it believable.  Give your audience a chance to be a little smarter.
1451673442|5.0|This is the first book that I have from Rhonda Byre. I love it. It inspires me a lot. It serves as my stress reliever too.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|What's NOT to say about The Lion King?! This is a great DVD and it was great to be able to get it in DVD format since I am not a blu-ray user
B00785P2QC|5.0|I like this game.  A bit slow at first, but very addictive.  Lot of fun building my city and easy to play.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|This is not just another DVD!  The collectors Edition is beautiful and is a great item to add to a collection.
0316044695|4.0|When reading about a first hand account of something like this, it's hard not to think of the situation that they may have been in. I have read both Fearless and No Easy Day - both of them were a far superior read, however the premise is not as to the reading and the etiquette but to the &#34;meat and potatoes&#34; of the story.<br />Marcus' story is something that I admire and support in whatever way I can. I support the Lone Survivor foundation and wear their shirts.<br />However, the book reads a little choppy - sort of like reading someone's thoughts that were written down on a napkin or something to that effect.<br />Still, happy with the purchase.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I think this app is great if you usually sleep to some certain sounds (in my case frogs and river) and you happen go be wher  these sounds are not in the surroundings. You can combine them to make your own personalbsleepbaid.. highly rommend it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was one of the best attention keepers I've had in a long time. Couldn't wait to start Book Two.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Enjoyed this book. Good plot. I had wanted to read it for awhile so I was happy when it was a daily deal on my new Kindle.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I've seen this movie countless times sine I bought it and I tear up every single time!  It's such a sweet, touching story and fantastic actors!
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Kids loved it . . . when they're happy - I'm happy!<br /><br />8 more words?!!!!  What more can I say?!!!
B00A0R0CG0|4.0|Got this for my 4 year old son, he enjoyed it but not sure he will want to watch it again.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|I watched this with my teenage daughters who also dance.  It was a fun, family friendly film and full of amazingly talented dancers.  I would highly recommend this film.
B0001US62I|5.0|I was very happy with this DVD. In perfect condition. I've added to my growing collection of older movies that never get shown on cable or TV. Very sinister movie plot with lots of twists and turns, and two actors I enjoy watching who never disappoint in the roles they take on. Be careful who you make a deal with. The asking price may be higher then you're will to pay!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Very fun and creative  I recommend it to any kid in need of some fun<br />p.s. it is a little challenging for the human mind
B00023BLXK|5.0|I am a big fan of the first Dirty Dancing movie with Patrick and Jennifer, so it was a no brainer for me when the Havana Nights version came out. The music(latin flavor)and location is different from the first, as is the story line, but I was sold at the first dance routine. Music and dancing has a way of making peoples lives richer, that is what this movie showed, and that was my take away, just as in the original. Music and dancing is a universal expression of emotions and feelings that don't always translate well with words no matter what the language is! I enjoyed watching the two different cultures come together and blend because of their love of music and dancing.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Couldn't stop reading the book... needed to find out what happened to Richard Parker. Part Three required the most thinking.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is a page turner, loved the book and cannot wait to start the nee one- a must read
1400067820|5.0|The author Nassim Taleb, brings the reader into the globes continuing economic dramas with sharp critiques and a dry wit that makes this a page turner reading forward or re-reading back. Take a break from the herd and purchase this work.<br />... and stop saying moo... We are humans, after all.
B00884GR0W|5.0|Okay, I'll get the obvious comparison out of the way:<br /><br />I initially downloaded this viewing it as a Minecraft knock-off. I know it isn't (both games borrow from the same source material), but I still had the perception I'd be playing an inferior product.<br /><br />Man was I wrong. The quality is excellent. It's fun to the point that I almost ran my phone out of batteries the first time I really played it. The control works well for how complex it us, and the pace of the game is perfect for the phone format.<br /><br />I may have only started playing because I got it as the Free App of the Day, but now I think it's easily worth $5 or $10 for Android. If you like an open world sandbox at all, you'll love Block Story.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|good video for background in gameroom while we play darts, pool etc...the music is good and the snowboarding is amazing.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|i liked its graphics . good music and interactive.i hope they come oolut with more. no glitch. works good on my kindle fire.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game taxes you're puzzle solving skills whilst not stressing you out by reguiring time skills too.  It's a terrfic game with soothing background music!
1401917232|3.0|Most fans of Disappearance of the Universe and Your Immortal Reality have a pretty good understanding about the nature of forgiveness, so sure, we can apply the concept to the idea of not getting a book that was promised years ago.  But isn't anyone curious as to why it hasn't been released?  Is it a legal issue?  A complete rewrite based on new information? If we're all in this together I don't see any harm in a little transparency - it might bring a little peace to the situation.  Don't get me wrong, the first two books have changed lives so a third (and fourth) book would be great, but until then there is plenty of other ACIM material available for anyone who wants it - including the actual text... but why the secrecy?
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|its really addictive. and fun enjoy<br />its the best war game out here. if u want to pass time and take over the world then this is the game for u
B006YTTVHO|4.0|It was very informative. I enjoyed it. Things I already knew and practice, but still good. You will like it
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Easy reading.  Finished it in just 1 seating... Entertaining  and  simply easy to read.  I will look for other books by the same authr
B0083ZRAJS|2.0|Is it possible that this book is really over? It's just so good<br />,excellent, exiting, hopeful, funny, and full of surprises.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Easy to read,  interesting and entertaining.  Great to just lay back with it.  Loved the plot and the way it was developed
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this!!! it is so perfect!! in live with this game so much.Thus game is so beautifully created! Is a must!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I had an &#34;almost&#34; complete Columbo collection that I pieced together over the years. When Amazon had this on for a deal during their Black Friday sales I couldn't resist! I will be bringing it down when I visit my dad and we'll have a Columbo marathon, ...... or two!<br />For those who aren't familiar with the Columbo format, it is a unique TV detective show. The viewer gets to see the bad guy commit the crime, and the rest of the show is all about Columbo's unique &#34;process&#34; as he sorts it all out. Truly unique! I've seen them all several times over the years, but I never tire of them. Peter Falk was masterful with this role - RIP Peter - your legacy lives, and entertains, on and on and on!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Beautifully written story of survival and sacrifice, I couldn't put it down. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a strong character driven story and action.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I recommend  THE SECRET KEEPER.  I have read all of Kate Morton's novels and look forward to her next one.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I'm a long time Mah Jongg player! I love this app! I can play for a few minutes when I'm on my lunch, waiting for friends, waiting for an oil change etc.  I have recomended it to several friends!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I was yelling to my wife as the plot twists occurred ,,,no no no!<br />Completely engrossing and as a father makes you look deep in the eyes of your teenagers and wonder what is lurking behind them
B007N5YIUS|5.0|My daughter and grand daughter have Angry Birds so they suggested I download it. It's relaxing to sit and play when I have some down time. Something to take the mind off your day
B009HEJXFS|4.0|As fun as you can expect a MEN IN BLACK movie to be. Will Smith is hilarious! Josh Brolin does a convcing impression of Tommy Lee Jones. Also it's a fun trip back to 1969.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|The action was fun but the overall character motivations were strained in my opinion.  It was worth watching, but I am glad I waited to rent it instead of seeing it in theaters.
B004B1H8MC|5.0|If you love Christmas and Mariah Carey, you will adore this album.  Besides the festive, beautifully sung music, you get some lovely Christmas cards you can actually use, a lovely butterfly ornament and a sample of her mesmerizing perfume.  What more can you ask for.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Good playable game.  Fun and has plenty of options and prizes. It takes a w hile to get to higher leveld so game hss good playable windows of time.  Claw game is also fun.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|so far its a pretty fun game to play. I have not had very many issues with it yet and I like the little mini games you can play too. I didn't give it a five because I am only level 6 so there is a lot more to go yet.
1439170916|4.0|Very well done. Well written, Interesting and very informative; starting with a general background of medicine, eventually focusing on cancer and it's concerns and research today.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|There was about 15 minutes of good comedy that made you laugh... The rest of it was stupid! Not what I thought it would be.
1451648537|5.0|Great read. Interesting, informative and well detailed. This book proved to provide me with a detailed view of a most interesting, creative character including both his personal and work world..
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Absolutely a must read. Can't put it down... it makes you wonder what the future holds if we are not more careful.
B008476HBM|5.0|I hadn't read this for many, many years. It's amazing how a life perspective can enhance something I thought I knew already.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Awesome read.  Well put together plot for a book about a video game.  Good twists.  The second book, the one about the video game itself by a different author was not as good.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I can see why this book is popular - full of sex and intrique - beautiful woman, handsome man.  However, any time I see a woman being used and putting herself in a position where she is not in control troubles me.  Domination is not a topic that I find desirable.  I prefer reading about strong women who can be role models and mentors to other young women.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I thought it was going to be your run of the mill sci-fi survival horror book....GLAD I was wrong.  It is a tale of survival and humor on a planet where even bacteria can't survive.  Imagine if MacGuyver got trapped on Mars and had to survive long enough to escape, now combine that with razor sharp humor, excellent pacing, and suspenseful moments that have you rooting for the protagonist the whole book.  I was quite impressed and will definitely be looking for future books by Mr. Weir.
B00338QENI|4.0|Unexpectedly interesting story about how cancer cells from a one woman, long deceased, have been multiplied many time over and aided in cancer research.  The writer went to a lot of effort (which she tells about) to track down the family of the Henrietta Lacks.  Very interesting read.  Could have been edited a little better -- to many words in places.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|GREAT GRAPHICS FUN AND EXCITING. Different mind puzzlingly games to keep you interested and wanting to play more as well as a good story line.
0812993292|4.0|It's an old story, the story of a man who sets off on a quest, and yet it's a new story, too.<br /><br />Harold Fry wakes up one morning and heads down the road for his daily walk and impulsively decides to keep walking, to go all the way to the care center where an old friend is dying. He's just that day received a letter from the friend, a former co-worker he has not heard from in twenty years. Queenie Hennessy is in hospice and he wants to see her. He wants to walk to her. And she is six hundred miles away.<br /><br />As long as he is walking, she will not die, Harold thinks.<br /><br />Like all classic quests, Harold meets lots of helpful characters along the way and has lots of little adventures and, most importantly, along the way, he comes face to face with his own character and decides to become a changed person.<br /><br />I kept reading a little and setting the book down for a bit and then reading a little more, the way I often do with books I don't want to end. But, of course, it must end and it did end. Unless you pick it up and read it, too, and then share your thoughts with me.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|Still fun, but we had to use a screwdriver to take it apart to put in the batteries.  It does make sounds but it is really quiet.  In a quiet room it is easily heard, but if there is any ambient sound around, it gets washed out and it is difficult to detect. ...especially if you are watching the show.
0374214913|4.0|Clay Jannon shuffles into Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore in search of a job and discovers another world. Clay mans the bookstore during the long hours of the night shift and is surprised to learn that there are very few real customers. Instead, the same people return regularly and, rather than buying books, check them out. A mysterious bookstore. A mysterious society. Seeking a mysterious secret hidden through the ages in books. Mysterious.<br /><br />Clay is intrigued and draws on the knowledge of new and old friends to solve the mysteries.<br /><br />I was delighted with this little story. Fun. Mysterious, of course. And ultimately satisfying.
B003LAH7MU|4.0|This has been a joy to listen to often.  A great choice for someone that likes Sting or The Police.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I'm not usually a fan of Sparks -- his books are often either boring or too sappy, but now and then there's a good one. I actually enjoyed this book. Maybe it was just my mood at the time, I'm not sure. Oh, there's definitely nothing too in-depth about this book. It's totally predictable (the story was pretty much the same as the movie &#34;Sleeping with the Enemy&#34; with Julia Roberts) and his writing is often elementary. I mean, do we really need a full description of what a s'more is and how it's made? Dumb. But, the story still flowed well and it was a quick, easy, enjoyable read. Maybe I liked it more because I was picturing Josh Duhamel as Alex and Julianne Hough as Katie (from the movie that's about to come out). Who knows, but it worked for me. I'm sure some won't like it, but this is my review and not theirs ;) It helped pass a dreary day for me in a pleasant way, and that's all that matters.
B004HWR406|4.0|Interesting movie about the founding of facebook and the jerks who came up with it. Nicely written by Aaron [West WIng, Sports Night] Sorkin.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Good movie, good price, good condition, and a good buy. I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and he was very excited about it and its great condition.
B0046UGSNS|1.0|Not sure what all the praise was about. A bunch of smug, entitled unhappy people doing nothing much. Skip it.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I've read all books by Tim and I believe this one is the most important. Not the part about actual cooking.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|All the Toy Story Films are marvelous - and this one is no exception. Fun story, new friends and a thrilling adventure. Your kids will love it and so will you.
B002QRWJA4|4.0|Bought this as a gift and what else can be said.  If you like the movie then you'll like this DVD.
0345803493|5.0|what a good book, loved the first one. came in great shape and was just what i expected it to be
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl was filled with unexpected twists and turn throughout, and I couldn't putti down.  The authentic dialog and character development put me right into the settings.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed this Grisham novel better than his last few that involved lawyers. (I really enjoyed Calico Joe.) It kept me interested and had me guessing. Still not as good as his early novels, but it was worth the read.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|If you like the TV series, you'll like this.  It's entertaining and interesting.  Suspenseful, a little bit of forensics, a little romance.  It's not &#34;War and Peace&#34;, but it's perfect light reading.
B00846REIS|3.0|This book has been compared to 50 Shades, and I think I prefer 50 Shades.  Not to say that I didn't enjoy this book, although I did get frustrated with Eva and her insecurities. Oveall, it was a pretty good read.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I wanted to like this book. I purchased it almost solely due to the great reviews here and the bargain price.  The story line was interesting and the main characters absorbing, but the level of detail in the affectionate encounters between them started to get kind of nauseating to me after a while.  I feel a bit guilty saying this because it is a sweet book and I was rooting for the pair.  I certainly wanted to finish this book and I did.  I am in no way a prude about romantic situations in media but the prose was so repetitive that it became distracting, at least to me.  I think I would have loved this book as a teen or young adult, but it felt immature to me.  Cute read but not a great book in my opinion. Don't be angry at me if you loved this book and are reading this review.  I can appreciate how someone could adore this book it had some lovely things about it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Good book. I desperately want to know which story is true! But I suppose that's the point. Now on to watch the movie...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|omg I have been waiting to.get this game on my kindle.fire for who knows how long!!! its great! if you are a horse lover like me you need to get it
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Good book, however it doesn't start getting you hooked until the end of the book. It does leave you wanting more.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|Nikor may always be more expensive but for the price you can't beat picking this up. Fits great on my kit lens and helps provide good quality images.
B005LAII3U|4.0|This remake has the basic story line as the original but with a twist. It is set completely on one planet and does not get too deep into the resistances plot but concentrates more on the main character on the run until the end. Special effects are excellent though. Lots of action from start to end.
B0055PGUYU|2.0|The title suggests this book might involve helpful hints on how to make and/or break good and/or bad habits. The book is actually just a collection of (occassionally interesting) anecdotes re successful careers. But some of the role models slightly grated my personal values. The account of Tony Dunge's career was certainly interesting in its own right. But the book subtly discounts spiritual values of Dunge and at least one other role model.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|As usual, Nelson DeMille combines a great story with his famous humor.  I have read all his books, and look forward to each new one.  This keeps one's interest as it pertains to today's Middle East terrorist problems.
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|With James Bond this works, and I'm not saying that it never could have worked for this series, but in this case, they should just quit until they have something worthwhile.  Take a break long enough to let their creativity actually create instead of just repeat itself.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Oregon Trail: American Settlers is a fun game - when it works. Unfortunately, that is very rare. This is the most frustrating game I have ever attempted to play on any Android or iOS device. Before wasting your time to download, I suggest visiting the GameLoft forums so that you can see the many bugs and glitches. Inevitably, every forum moderator asks you to place a help ticket so that they can send you a generic email thanking you for your patience and asking you to bear with them and wait for the next update (which is likely weeks to months away). Games are supposed to be fun - Oregon Trail American Settlers is only frustrating. Don't waste your time unless you really enjoy constant bugs/glitches, frustration, and unplayable games.

B0060AY6FO|2.0|I found the plot unnecessarily convoluted and the writing overly wordy and strained. Not Jane Austen, not by a long shot.

B006OE7XM4|5.0|since i've been listening to this CD for many months, it is surely going to get worn out!  i could not love it more.  Gregory Porter is brilliant.  don't know if i love his voice, arrangements, delivery or original songs more.  i love all of it.  he IS all of it!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I don't usually go in for thrillers, but this one was really well constructed and well written. It made me want to read the rest of her books.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Quick, but a good wrap up.<br />Could have all been one book.<br />Final romance at the end could have been a bit more touching and heartfelt.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|So well written and researched.  I feel compelled to read the history of the last century.  Book One was excellent too, and looking forward to the last book in the Trilogy.  Will never be able to understand how man can be so cruel to man.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|this game is really fun!it's more than your typical hidden object game. I like that the're' s several types of puzzles to solve and that the environment is interactive. I wish you didn't have to pay to get the rest of the game.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|As ILM's only foray into the feature-length animation world, Rango shines above anything Pixar or Disney has done so far. The animation is unbelievably fine, but as we all know, that alone can't carry a movie.  The story is great, and there's a dark and edgy streak running through it that makes it enjoyable for those of us over 12.  There are funny references to be on the lookout for, as well.  My only issue is with the character of Beans, voiced by Isla Fisher.  I'm not in love with the look of the character, and Fisher's voice and staccato, fake-southern-accent machine-gun performance makes it sometimes hard to understand her, and sometimes hard to tolerate her.  With everyone else's superb voice-overs, it's hard to understand why they went with Fisher for one of the main characters.  But that aside, it's a genuinely fabulous movie, even for those who aren't always up for animated flicks.  Yes, the kids can watch it (there are only a couple of mild oaths, and they've heard worse on the playground), but I think Rango is one of those movies that is more appreciated by adults, especially this one.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Its well worth watching if you're a fan of Sci Fi. This is very different when compared to the original movie and should be. If anyone has read the short story &#34;We can remember it for you wholesale&#34; by Philip K. Dick you'll see why as this is the story both versions of the movies are based on. It keeps you thinking as you expect but some of the twists are different and original. The Plot is very different as it has more political impact as well as taking place at a different location then the Arnold version. Both are great movies but are very different from each other. This version does not disappoint at all and is worth watching, if not getting.
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you like to play Solitaire then you'll enjoy this game. It has automatic movement when you tap the cards, you don't have to drag the cards. Good game for the price. Since I have had it for awhile, the only problem I have is it periodically insists that you connect to the internet or it will not allow you to play the game. This is because they are wanting you to purchase an updated version. I don't like this because if I take my Kindle with me and do not have my internet with me, I cannot play the game. I want to have control on the game that I purchased & not be instructed to connect.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome book!!  Can't wait to read the next book in the series.<br />Can't wait to see the movie also.  Great series so far!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I know a lot of people read these books for their steamy content,and while it is entertaining I grew interested in the story behind Eva and Gideon. This book contained a lot more drama and insight and I enjoyed it.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Danes is shockingly convincing; all the players are perfectly cast. Tried to spread out our watching of the first season over a week, but couldn't do it: Watched it all in two evenings! On to Season Two for those of us who didn't see it on Showtime.
B002M7A79S|5.0|great followup to the Firefly series that wraps things up nicely and answers many outstanding questions.  Too bad Serenity 2 won't likely happen.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I play it all the time but u should put mincarts and levers and buttons pipes and inchantment tables but I still love this game:)
B009M8TA20|5.0|Zlatan is the kind of guy you dont want to mess with. While we happened to meet this type of person everyday, he is the one who take it a step above, walk the talk literally and stay true to himself for most part of his career (except while he was in Barcelona, which he clearly admitted in the book, and us the football fans noticed it when he was playing).<br /><br />The intricate details of how all the transfers happens and his opinions of all the bosses and coaches is revealing and gives insight to us readers of what is the true nature of these people, at least from the eye of Zlatan. It also helps that he works with the best bosses in the world. Mourinho, Capello, Guardiola, everyone. His story is quite detail and satisfying so much so that watching the rerun on youtube videos while reading the book bring more life to the story.<br /><br />This book inspired me to be who i am, dont afraid to talk smack but work hard to prove it. Finished the book in 1 day, assigned as a striker the next day (I played in amatuer league, our strikers couldnt come lol. always a winger) and scored a Zlatan goal! (shield and sweet top corner goal. Never scored on 2012 season. start 2013 with a goal!). Later the same day while waiting for a car to clear a parking lot, a bloke raced me in. I stand up to him and clearly state that the parking lot is mine. He pulled out and I got it (after some minor threat..). Thats how the book has inspired me! on day one!<br /><br />Too bad the book ended only until his Milan days. Would LOVE to read how he land that huge deal at Paris SG.<br /><br />As a reminder for everyone, I try to read both books, the official english translation which is sold here, and the original fan translation from the original book. Needless to say, the original translation is SO MUCH BETTER and feels like Zlatan is talking to you, rather then the translation that have an englishman sounding tough like he can ever be a Zlatan.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Such a great Cd to have. For anyone who  Buys it you wont be disappointed i know i wasnt .
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This is one of those books that truly inspires you to become active, or more active, due to the personal accounts and scientific reasons to back them up. Certainly a great book to leave on your coffee table and tell your friends about when they stop by, as it will lead to endless conversation about the abilities of the human body, your fitness routine, others' fitness routines, and more. It is especially inspiring to anyone who has nearly given up on running. It revives your spirit and belief in yourself as an athlete, as it tells the tales of true human vigor and ability. If they can run 100+ miles at once, you can certainly run a 5K, 15K, half marathon, marathon, and more! You just have to fix your posture, throw away your shoes ;-), and get going!
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I loved reading this book as it was written in a way to keep you interested the whole way through and kept you thinking.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This fun game comes with a caveat.  This game is addicting!  Watch out! I have already logged one too many hours on here!
B0052RDHTM|2.0|moved to slow......to much un needed detail on the war which I fine very boreing. although some people would like it.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|The coin dozer is one of my favorite games in the real world and this looked like it would be light fun - not as highly involved in time or effort as one of the video games.  It met my full expectations and simulates the real game well.  Then came the awakening.  When I ran out of coins, I was offered the option of obtaining more coins and was shocked back into the real world when I learned that additional coins were available but only for a very real monetary fee which I find totally rediculous and offensive.  If I am going to spend real money for tokens, I will do it with a real machine that dispenses real prizes.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Covered trial great. Went on and on about vacation. Lacked detail on second murder. Hasty, abrupt ending that left me disappointed.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This was a gift for the grand-daughter and she really likes, price not to bad, quality was good, and Kindle looked good in case
0321885112|5.0|Mike Rhode has produced a great Handbook to the art of Sketchnotes that provides an equally accessible resource for practitioners and those new to the art.  A piece of art in itself, the book practices what it preaches as he delivers his content in sketchnote format.  His invitation to others to share their styles and tips for listening and capturing makes for both entertaining and enlightening perusal. Last but not least he invites you to play and learn within the pages.  Enjoy!
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|I hate country music, but I am in love with the show! I think all the songs that are on the show are so catchy and they get stuck in my head, so I was very satisfied to learn that they came out with a soundtrack halfway through the first season! All your favorites are right here on this CD. Even if you've never seen the show before, I think this is a good pop/country CD you will fall in love with. The songs are raunchy and theres no cussing, just clean, feel good music. And who knew Hayden could sing! She doesn't disappoint!
B009G78EE2|5.0|This album is great, an amazing mix of politics and humor. These two guys make some really enjoyable music together.
B007RI56NY|5.0|So I started to become a fan of Train back when &#34;Meet Virginia&#34; was a big hit, and if you're expecting something like that, you may be disappointed?! I really love their songs from the album that are on the radio so I decided to give this CD a buy! It was also cheaper on here than iTunes, and I got to say, I really love this album. I think Train has evolved, but in a good one. Music has been changing compared to when they first came out and I would say this album is successful in the change unlike some artists!
B0079R8KO0|4.0|I bought this for my husband's kindle. He says it's sturdy and he likes it. Such a man to give a simple answer lol. I like the strap it has that keeps it closed.
B004YM6JP0|5.0|WOW, this season was such a steal for the price! In stores this is upwards of $50 and couldn't believe I found it on here for $25. I love this show, and it came in perfect condition as described. Fast shipping as well, no complaints!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I wish it were longer. Still a good game. Graphics were good. I liked the ho games with the dominoes.
1594489505|5.0|Terrific book....teaches about a different culture, well written, easy to read and understand.  This was a gift, then I borrowed it!
0765325950|5.0|First of all, people who give this book 1 Star because it doesn't come out on Kindle for months are idiots. How can you write a review for a book based on the lack of a publishing medium? This book is a solid conclusion to a great Fantasy series.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|I love the price & the convenience of the Kindle version of this textbook! So quick & easy to download, and much cheaper than the textbook offered at my University's bookstore. Plus it is lighter to carry to class, saves paper, and I didn't have to wait for it to arrive in the mail.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Today's music all starts to blend together and sound the same.... And then came Lindsey!!!<br />What a breath of fresh air. Her music alone stands her out from the crowd of vanilla, but when you tie in her amazing dancing and visual colors, one word... AWESOME!!!!<br /><br />One of my favorite albums in a long time.<br /><br />And if you get a chance to see her live in concert, DO NOT HESITATE TO GO!! You will dance your arce off.<br /><br />As Lindsey humbly says, &#34;I can't believe you all came out to watch a violin recital.&#34; Maybe that is what Mozart said at his first concert.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Interesting look into the mind of a teenager.  I liked the letter format.  Not sure why there were sections to the book.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|A movie to recommend to all my friends and not only ... Unfortunetly it had to end with another unrealistic act of heroism done by the main character ( as always in all the American movies ... !!! )
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|I can get into alot of movies even if they start out slow but this movie just was not the movie I thought it was going to be.I really thought it was going to have more action in it,But it did not.Did not care for the movie.
B005JABSB6|5.0|They have a newer version out. The number is AN3DG30B I think. These are nicer, I returned the newer 1's because these were bigger and fit much better especially when wearing my regular glasses underneath. Great glasses, can be switched to 2D mode also if someone doesn't want to watch it in 3D while others are watching in 3D.
B001NHN7TU|2.0|Movie was good but the delivery was poor. Movie feed continuously stopped & started,  So far not a fan of the service
B008518MOW|5.0|Some of the best 3D scenes I have ever seen in a 3D movie. This is 1 movie that is surely worth watching in 3D.
B00785P2QC|4.0|great game.. i just started and i like how many things you can build and how you can organize yod  ity az you want
B0042FZOFU|2.0|No estaba especificado que idiomas incluía, y supuse que el español sería algo estándar en USA. Pues no. Viene en Polaco, Hindú, etc ... y no viene en español. El error fue mío por comprarlo sin estar seguro. Tengan cuidado cuando no dice en que idiomas viene, tal vez no venga en español.
0765325950|5.0|A great ending.  It's both satisfying and heartbreaking at the same time.  If you're like me and have been reading the wheel of time for the better part of your life, then this will probably be bitter sweet.  It's great to know how it all turns out, yet at the same time, it's like losing an old friend.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson did a great job with this book, as well as the previous 2.  This one is of particular note though, just because of the raw rampant action.  Nearly the whole book is battle sequences.  You get a lot of questions answered finally as well.<br /><br />A must read
B002SF9YYI|4.0|THE BEST OF BRYAN FERRY IS A GREAT CD. THIS GAY IS REALLY GOOD SINGER, ALONE OR WITH ROXY MUSIC
B0083Z614S|4.0|I forgot how good this book is. As an adult reading, I understand the power of attraction, and because of that this novel has taken on a whole news meaning.
B0098VYKSA|5.0|I figured this movie could have gone one of very two different ways, good or bad.  I will say, it exceeded my expectations, enjoyed it very much.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|I'll review this for your benefit, not mine. That is, I may value certain aspects of a movie more or less than you do, or vice versa. For example, someone who flees the room if there's any violence in a movie won't want to see this firm, despite its PG rating. There's violence and it's a scary movie at times. Not like, say, \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" but it isn't an episode of \\"Friends\\" either.<br /><br />And after seeing this film last night (and never having read the book or read about the book), I would make a few blanket recommendations:<br /><br />1. See this in 3D unless 3D makes you oopsy (as it does a friend of my wife's). I think most people would agree that this film goes far past poke-you-in-the 3D, but instead makes the visual depth integral with the cinematography.<br />2. See this in Blu-Ray if not in a theater. Its visual quality is both right up there at the state of the art, AND it's a major part of the film's appeal.<br />3. Avoid reading any other reviews of the film but this one before you see it, because I won't give you any spoilers, and most reviewers--pro and amateur--do. And in the case of \\"Life of Pi\\" it's really important to avoid spoilers. This movie is especially skillful at giving nothing away as you go along, while not \\"cheating\\" and hiding anything either. A friend who had seen it before warned me to suspect my sense of disbelief for this--that I wouldn't be sorry afterwards, despite my tendency to dissect-as-I-go, and she was right.<br /><br />Why you might not want to see this film:<br /><br />1. It's not a typical \\"good\\" Hollywood film, with a propulsive plot and an array of famous stars you enjoy watching in films. None of the actors are much known in America. So despite some intense action sequences, on the whole it's not a swiftly-paced film.<br /><br />2. It's not a love story. And if you enjoy watching beautiful men and women interact onscreen for a couple of hours, this ain't that. It's a half-naked 17 year old boy not interacting with other people through most of it (though not uninterruptedly).<br /><br />3. It's not an action movie per se.<br /><br />4. It's not a horror movie, and it's not really any other well-known genre. I was reminded a bit of Terence Malick's films like \\"The Thin Red Line,\\" which is more a meditation on war than a regular war movie.<br /><br />5. This is a bit of a judgment call, but I'd say the screenwriting and acting are competent but not spectacular. However, the visuals throughout are spectacular. The plot is interesting, though some say it isn't as philosophically deep as it thinks it is. Could be; not a big problem for me.<br /><br />6. If you're a religious ideologue, firmly committed to your faith--whatever it is--and believing all other faiths are worthless and must be shunned, you're going to find this off-putting. Maybe you could watch it with the sound off for the glorious visuals.<br /><br />7. I would have taken my kids to see this film when they were young, but only after talking about it with them to make sure they wanted to see a film that skirts the upper end of violence and scary action acceptable in a PG film. Parents who are raising their kid in a \\"sweetness & light\\" bubble shouldn't take their kids to see it.<br /><br />Why you might want to see it:<br /><br />1. The absolute state of the art in 3D cinematography and mise-en-scene, and in a director exploiting 3D for narrative effect and not just 3D for 3D's sake.<br /><br />2. A tale that's more interesting in retrospect than it was during most of the movie--it definitely left me mulling it over afterwards, and satisfyingly so.<br /><br />3. Absence of the shadow big box office stars cast over a story.<br /><br />4. If you're a scuba diver like me, or just like watching underwater specials, there are some great visuals for us here, and as a diver I can tell you that the underwater stuff is solidly reality-based, fantastic though some of it seems. Probably the same goes for anyone who's a naturalist of some sort. A lot of Wonders of Nature here.<br /><br />5. If you're religious but very ecumenical or nonreligious but not judgmental about religion (except for the fundamentalist stuff), you'll probably enjoy this movie. It definitely has that \\"we are all One with the Infinite, and it/them/him/her with us\\" vibe.<br /><br />6. It doesn't anthropomorphize the animals in the film. Unsentimental, really.<br /><br />7. If you're a woman or a homosexual man you might enjoy watching a half-naked 17 year old youth for the better part of two hours. Me being neither this wasn't a drawing card for me but I'm sure it would be for some, and my job here isn't to tell myself whether or not to see it, but to tell you--whoever you are.<br /><br />8. This is one of those films that I think will be talked about for years, so it you're a film buff, you probably need to have seen it just to keep up with movie conversations.<br /><br />9. This would be a great movie to see with the whole family and talk about afterwards, as long as your kids can handle the most violence & scary action possible for a film to have & still get a PG rating.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I didn't leave the theater powerfully moved, but then I AM a scuba diver, so I've seen a lot of marine stuff myself, up close and personal. I thoroughly enjoyed it, though--enough to write a review here.<br /><br />One last note: I've been stranded by myself in the open ocean with no rescue in sight several times. It only lasted a matter of minutes, but I can tell you it's an intense experience even when it's short (one time after a night dive on a moonless night in an obscure chain of islands west of New Guinea was especially intense). So I can relate to the castaway aspect of this film--which is its heart in some ways--in ways that are outside the personal experience of most filmgoers. And I think this does a fair job of capturing that feeling. It brought back my memories of floating along in the water pretty strongly!<br /><br />I will have other conversations about \\"Life of Pi\\" with friends who have seen it, but I won't spoil it for you by going into those aspects.ralist of some sort.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Riveting novel, could not put it down. Great descriptions of the love scenes.<br />the book did take an unexpected turn in the middle, but that's what fiction is all about.
B001NTJTUY|5.0|I love all of the songs in this movie, not to mention the movie itself!  It's hauntingly beautiful, and one of my favorites!
0316069434|5.0|Excellent!  The Harry Bosch s novels are great!  I've read all these Michael Connelly books, and I've loved them all!
0984183523|5.0|The approach to cases taken in this book is a bit different from others, but very appealing - particularly if you don't want to memories but understand and be able to develop own structures.<br />The additional material online is also very useful.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We have been unable to stop watching since we picked up Season 1 just a couple of weeks ago! Terrific!

0425264351|5.0|Despairing that tom cruise is pretending he could ever be anything like jack reacher!!<br />I love these books! Started with two most recent then went back to the beginning. Will never want to see the movies since they put in tom cruise. What were they thinking!?
0345803507|5.0|Very good story with added bonus material.  LOL.  Not as good as 'Bared to You' series but still good.  Would read again.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I was hooked immediately! Original storyline.Funny.<br />The non kissing scence was incredibly passionate<br />The character Holder r was so mature until he through out the F bomb. Even the scences where he is telling her how brave she is he throws in F-ing. Just so not necessary. Other jarring thing was that the author told us the scene. He put his head down,  she leaned on the counter, taking her hand he placed it... - make the reader visualize the scene without a play by play. FOR INSTANCE<br /><br />SPOILER<br />The climax was shocking. Frankly I was appauled.  Their recovery was too unrealistically quick. You cant have<br />blood on you one day and send an email the next. On the flip side the mini pep talks were repetitive. Too tidy of an ending
0425263908|5.0|Pre-ordered the 2nd book and also ordered a couple more of her books.  She is a great story teller.  This story is better than 50 shades in my opion.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book! I wasn't able to put it down. I even kept pestering coworkers about my predictions...honestly the last book I've been able to read and make guesses to was the final Harry Potter book.  I believe that so many books are too cookie cutter, Hunger Games was a refreshing surprise.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I decide to read the book I don't know what expect but after I read the first chapter this book caught my attention and I couldn't put away so now let see what happens when I have the chance to read the book two.

B0083TXXZ4|5.0|This was bought for a friend's son. She said that he really enjoyed it, and that it worked well. Fantastic!
B0068FYZCA|5.0|Great movie about us teenagers that grew up in the 60's. This blu ray dvd has great color and sound and has all the interviews of how the movie came to be , how the actors were picked, how the filming was done. etc. I still have a 56 Chevy street rod all hopped up that I go out cruising in on  summer nights. I did quite a bunch of the cruising and drag racing in Coalinga, California back in  67 -70 and this movie depicts truly how it was back then.
B00A9V2JSG|2.0|spoiler**************<br /><br />I really loved this book while reading it, but the Titanic like ending did absolutely nothing for me. There was no reason for it. She had no interest in going to the wilds before she met alex so why woukid you make her go without him? I dont even want to go on in the series now,  so disapointed.The ending ruined it for me.
B0072V394E|4.0|Not bad, some of the scenes from the new movie are based on this western. It got a little corny 3/4 thru the movie. Good guy with something of a grudge was really out for the gold?
B004EPYZUI|1.0|this movie is just absolutely terrible. it is composed of mindless action scenes with a terrible plot in between.  I should have been more weary after Snyder destroyed The Watchmen.  I thought I'd give it a chance for 4 dollars on Black Friday but it seems like I was absolutely wrong what a waste of 4 dollars.  Can Zack Snyder please refund these 2 hours of my life that were totally wasted?
B006FO3ERQ|1.0|Such a sad and depressing story written in a long meandering way. I was ecstatic for it's finish! Would NOT recomend.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|for anyone who loves horses this will be a grate game for you. amazing scenes. but this game isn't for everyone.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because it made me realise the importance of listening to yourself and following your passions.
1407130293|5.0|I can't say enough in the positive about these books they are fun exciting and if you want page turning suspense this is the place. NOT for the young  reader though because of graphic violence.
0345803507|4.0|This book was an excellent end to a great series.  Yes it is &#34;racy&#34; but also great character development and a good story line.  Couldn't put it down.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I so badly wanted this to work in audio so I could just listen with my earbuds. However it continually locks up necessitating a reboot even to work. The search feature seldom works correctly after the 1st search undertaken. The layout is confusing and you end up in the wrong place continually. And something about reporting the errors in the log that did not stay long enough to write down???  The audio is nice when it does work with amazing clarity though.
B004Y042N8|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game, it makes you use your brain, not like a lot of other games where you know what to do automatically - this one makes you think a few moves ahead in the game.  Yes, it is a bit like connect the dots, but it's not and it's on a much grander scale, if you don't start out right, it doesn't work.<br /><br />It works great on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; and I can play anywhere, so it's a great time filler too.  I've had no problems running this for a week and all goes smooth every time I play.  Young kids will enjoy the easy starter puzzles and grown-ups will enjoy the harder ones.  Give it a try!!
B007SGM084|5.0|This was a very interesting and intriguing book from the very first few pages. I read all three books in 10 days. It is a book about desire but with a twist of behavioral ideas within the book. I loved the book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so much fun:) a must get...and its nice because its free. good graphics and nice mini games. hard to put down
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Loaded onto my Kindle, I find it difficult to navigate around to see the quotes and likes thru out the app, I believe that can make it easier to see things within the app, from my pc the facebook app provides all views that I like.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|Not very scary but very good. This movie was very well put together. I can say without a doubt that this will not let you down
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|I couldn't even try this app. Tried using it on my Kindle Fire with no good result. It just stays on the loading screen. I have uninstalled and reinstalled but to no avail. If I paid for this I would have been very upset. Purchasing this app should be avoided by those using a Kindle Fire / hd.
B0063GORYU|5.0|i will enjoy this game playing it with my grandaughter . she helps me out alot good past time thanks
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I was purchasing this CD primarily to get the song Fade Into You.  When I read the reviews stating that the song was not included on the CD I was not going to purchase it until I saw they were providing a promotional credit to purchase the song with the purchase of the CD.  I thought about just purchasing the song but decided if they were standing behind the product I would buy the CD.  I am glad I did as it has some great songs on it as well!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this book. I downloaded it because it was free. At times I didn't want to put the book down. Like I said before, I was pleasantly surprised with this book.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|Samsara was filmed over 5 years vs. Baraka in 3 years and was arranged before the music was composed. Lisa Gerard and Michael Stearns did a fantastic job in building the music through out the film which created a piece of art that you will watch over and over again. I've seen this on a 70MM screen and at home. BUY IT!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app because it is like having my own horse without all of the expenses. I loved taking lessons when I was younger and hopefully this will suffice until I can get a horse of my own someday.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I fell in love with Abby and Travis I have read this book twice so far and I am now debating with myself not to read again,I truly enjoyed this book I LOVED it and can't wait for Travis' side of the story
0545265355|5.0|Decided to get this set for my girlfriend for Christmas after she had seen the first movie. The book set itself looks excellent and thw price for all three books couldn't be beat. My girlfriend is nearly done with the second book already and she is LOVING it. Going by her reaction to the story I'd have to say this series is recommended.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This is a fun game...not horribly difficult but an enjoyable way to waste time. I would definitely recommend this game. I got it as a free app of the day but I'm not sure if I would spend more than $0.99 for it.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|I've been a fan of Alice Munro for some time and thoroughly enjoyed this latest book.  I used to teach several of her short stories in an Intro to Lit. course at Golden West College.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is close to perfect.  Multiple buttons for rpg games.  I use this with ts for communication with one if the buttons without missing a beat.<br /><br />The only con is the plug and play in win 8 didn't work for the setting to upload properly.  But I went to the web site and downloaded the software and I was good to go.
0786956291|4.0|While I have been aware of the Dungeons and Dragons games for several years, I hadn't purchased any of them for myself because getting into the mythology seemed too daunting.  However, this Essential D&D Starter was a perfect way for me to toy around with character design, familiarize myself with the various dice, and even pay a few single-player campaigns.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the provided game board is almost too basic, and more experienced D&Ders may have a difficult time playing alongside novices with the provided equipment.  All things considered, however, the starter kit is a great idea for anyone like myself who isn't sure where to begin learning about Dungeons and Dragons.
B002RKSZWG|5.0|This is a very well written novel. Just like the rest of the Jane Austin's creations. Have read it and will read it many times over.
1451637500|1.0|How many writers have the courage to stand up to their publishers and NOT write just one more novel? I WANT more Bujold, but not at the expense of her expertise and story telling. 'Cryoburn' was one too many Vorkosigans. It was good to finally know how to pronounce his name. It was good to know what happens to everyone we've loved for so long. Hamilton and Harris (Anita Blake and Sookie Stackhouse) have written their characters to sad street-walker ends, so please Ms Bujold enough! Let them all have the happy and sad, short or long lives that come to all of us. Enough, put down your pen. We love you all, but enough...
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I wouldn't waste $4 on this movie.  The singing was great and Fat Amy's character was great, but the other acting wan't too great.
B001NOQI3U|4.0|I really think that this is such a great movie and I can't believe that I am just now watching it.  It will not be the last time for me.....I hope to watch it many more times.
B0067AC5KA|4.0|Exciting storyline, interesting characters.  Somewhat more difficult to follow all the Swedish names and locations.  Be prepared for a long but very enjoyable read.
1423101499|5.0|It ships fast. Great book for children, specially boys. I wish I knew it was a paperback but the price is fenomenal.
1416583432|5.0|Dogs are wonderful! This book explains many of their (sometimes) unpredictable behavior in an exciting way! It also helps us to be more tolerant and respectful with our lovely friends!
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the vocals. What a voice. The songs really show off Christina's terrific range and strengths.Buy it! It should be a classic.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a cool game<br />Yay y a ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya  ya ya ya ya
B009UX2YAC|5.0|very fun game im alwaaaays playing it its so much funner than temple run it works great on the kindle fire (:
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Simple read, yet very sexy. Be prepared for intense sexual explanations, not too graphic, but good enough for the imagination.
B00381A1MU|5.0|Our three year old is obsessed with anything that has a crane or a hook.  These cars hook into the remaining Chugginton train set easily and the magnetic crane lifts a cube of crushed recycling out of the recylicing car.  The little crushed cube has been used for many creative things with my sons other trains and trucks.  Good purchase.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Simple read, yet very sexy. Be prepared for intense sexual explanations, not too graphic, but good enough for the imagination.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Very entertaining and a cast of talented folks; music was wonderful and I found myself watching the movie again just to listen to  the music!
B008C20TDG|5.0|The Hartwig's have done loads of research for the content of their book, they included all the science, as well as dumbing it down for the average non-scientific reader. A lot of interesting facts and commentary. Also, make sure to check out their accompanying website for extra paleo guideline worksheets!
0425252868|3.0|The story of a &#34;A Higher Call&#34; is fantastic. The author and his brother (illustrations) did a lot of research to publish this book. I wish however that the author had studied up on aeronautical terms and definitions as well as german translation. The narrative of the german pilot's experience seems to come directly from either a german to english translation from someone who speaks good german and not good english. The translation is often literally what a german speaker says expressed in english resulting in awkward sentence structuring and phrasing. Throughout the book aeronautical terms and definitions are misused or subordinated into layman's language that no pilot uses. If you are going to write a book about pilots and flying, please use the lingo of aviation.
B001E45XT4|2.0|This headset ALWAYS breaks in the SAME spot. Me and my friends each got a pair about a year ago. For NO apparent reason, the plastic holding the earpiece on just snaps after a year. Honestly, I loved everything about this headset until this happened. Now I'm out a lot of money for a nice headset. It's just bad design. Please save yourself some headache in a year, and just look at a different one.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked this book, but it started of a little slow.  There were lots of twists & turns, but the ending was slightly disturbing!
B009LA1QW6|5.0|I love every song on this CD. Lana Del Rey is so unique and I love her music I might buy her other Cd
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I recently acquired a Kindle and have been using it for a variety of things:  reading books, watching tv shows, etc.  One morning I needed a basis calculator and was not near my computer, but my Kindle was close by.  I looked for an app, found this one, downloaded, and began using it immediately.  It is a basic calculator and at no cost.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved it. Just absolutely loved it. Not many books leave me wanting to read them again and this one did. Definitely recommend.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|A great blu-ray but the only thing I didn;t like was not getting the full 2 hour documentary - the different versions on various blu-rays and DVDs that now seem to be happening are very annoying.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|The series itself was recommended to me while at a book store; & after finishing the first, I couldn't help but buy the second. Ally Condie does not disappoint!
B000002LK1|5.0|Great, classic album. This has many of their radio hits plus other songs you may not have heard before. Should be able to find it for 3 bucks or less.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I chose this cd 'cause i'm a big fan of DJ and i like this kind of music. The songs are great, DJ's solos are just crazy and i like James's voice. I'm recommending it to everybody.
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|If it wasn't so cheap I would have been totally upset at paying movie theater prices. Barely entertaining with a plot that just does not follow the characters as they go from hard nose to mushy crap. It's like they had a good idea and then the liberals changed it mid-script, it sucked.
B008JFUUQ2|2.0|I received this as a Christmas gift and I thought I was really going to like it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I just could not get into this movie ... PERIOD.  I expected a lot more and only got through 30 minutes of it and I was bored.  If a movie can't capture my attention within a 1/2 hour, that's too long.<br /><br />Seems more like a Teen or Tween movie.
B0091LS07E|5.0|It took a little long to get the cd but it was worth it and the price was excellent compared to in store prices for cds. I would recommend to others.
030758836X|4.0|Let me just say up front that I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I say this even though at times I was asking myself, \\"Do I like any of these characters?\\" Well, I liked the female detective, Boney. I thought I liked Amy, until I didn't. Ditto, Nick. But despite my uncertainty, or maybe because of it, I couldn't put the book down. Gillian Flynn is a remarkable writer. She is adept at plot, pace, character development (a master here), narrative, and dialogue. I was particularly impressed with her ability to switch from the narrative as told by Amy, to the narrative as told by Nick. This was a real 'wow' factor in the book for me. I write. I know how hard this is. Let me be clear, this isn't great literature. It's great story-telling; funny, chilling, edge-of-the-seat engrossing, and all-together very satisfying. Highly recommended for your cabin in the woods vacation reading.
B00A80SHFM|2.0|Although I enjoyed the music ... because I loved the movie and have always loved the music ... I felt absolutely ROBBED after listening to it the first time. Where was &#34;Do you hear the people sing&#34;?? The fact that a short reprise of it is at the end, matters not at all. I wanted to hear the entire song sung with the fervor that the original singing of it in the movie portrayed. I wanted to sing along with the more familiar lyrics. It's not that I want my money back  ... I just want the song back.
B008CYDDWI|5.0|The transfer was done as it should have been. Everything is clear and crisp. Fans should appreciate the time taken to restore this film.
B006S08RLU|5.0|It didn't win an Oscar its year, but Amelie ranks #1 on my list. It's a quirky romantic comedy that leaves you feeling ready to go make your own positive influence in the world :)
B001HBX91S|2.0|Selections are nice but they are very brief. I would have expected lengthy selections. Doesn't matter if they belong to a lower number of events.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|He is a very talented musician! The lyrics are &#34;kid-friendly&#34;- my 6 year old even sings along in the car! This is one of the best albums I've purchased in a LONG time!
B00000G3I2|5.0|A classic. Even though the copy is good, it would have been great to have the Chill on Blue Ray. Hopefully we´l have it soon.
B00A9X9ORI|1.0|Terrible movie, actual voice then sound was way off. Could not understand what the actors were saying and then could not follow the movie
B005LAIIQC|2.0|I wasn't expecting the Jason Bourne character, but I was expecting more substance.  Yes, they alluded to Jason Bourne, even some of the same actors were the same as previous movies and Jeremy Renner can act, but the movie was hard to follow and just lacking.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|The beat caught my attention and then the lead - is that a guy? girl?  Definitely a female lead.  This album has grit, heart and really good lyrics.  I love it.  Listen to &#34;Hold On&#34; and &#34;Boys and Girls&#34; and I think you will be a fan, too.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I used to love the Pendergast novels, but I'm starting to tire of the formula. I feel like I'm reading the same book over and over. Once I got halfway through, I started skimming. I'd never skimmed before. I don't get why Child and Preston constantly refer to their characters by first and last name at the beginning of each chapter, as if we forgot their names. It just seems like something a first-time author would do. And there's so much filler: I don't give a rat's butt about Corrie and her father! Unless Pendergast fights a monster in the next book, I'm done with this series.
B0086972US|5.0|It is doubtful that you will ever hear any of these songs in their original state on TV.  In fact, I have never heard any song from this album outside of Internet Radio or Sirius.  BUT, I did hear a cleaned up and slightly modified version on the holiday episode of Glee.  YES, Glee.  With that being said, the song &#34;Let's have a Kiki&#34; brings a smile to my face.  Ok, ok, I know the band's name is a &#34;gay sexual position&#34; and that many of the songs may have gayish undertones.  SO?  You don't have to be gay to enjoy the music.  You may even find yourself laughing and maybe, just maybe catch yourself singing along.  YEP.. it's catchy and the music is made for moving.  No sitting still while listening to this album.  Get up and shake what your Momma gave you.
3527406018|5.0|THE DR. FOUND THE TEXT BOOK INFORMATIONAL AS WELL AS BEING DETAILED. IT GUIDES THE EXPERT OR THE NOVICE TO READ WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO THEIR PARTICULAR NEEDS.
B003V4SF0O|5.0|I stumbled onto David during a search of the &#34;2 Cellos&#34;.  Always looking for something new, I was shocked to discover that such Rock hits like &#34;Walk this Way&#34; and &#34;Welcome to the Jungle&#34; are given new life in Violin and Cello renditions.  WOW - who would have thought?  Not me.  I heard David's versions of &#34;Kashmir&#34; and &#34;Live and Let Die&#34; and was sold. Sometimes I just want to hear music, no singing, no lyrics... just music.  Soon after, I discovered numerous videos of David's performances. Impressive body of work.
B004GXZ69W|5.0|I love this mouse. It puts my hand, wrist, and arm in a natural position so there is no strain on my shoulder. My hand is right at the 7&#34; size above which they recommend the standard size mouse. The small fits my hand well. I combined it with the PRESTIGE INTERNATIONAL INC.KB1 Mouse-Friendly Keyboard (has the 10-key pad on the left) so that my hand is closer to the alpha-keypad. The combination works really well. Several of my coworkers have now purchased this mouse. I purchased it for the office and will purchase another for my home computer. Highly recommend it.
B005IKZ60G|5.0|David Guetta.  who is that?  He's French and seems to have an eye or ear for mixing.  I think he has recorded hits with just about everyone that is someone lately.  My favorite video features Nikki Minaj in &#34;Turn me On&#34;.  The concept is &#34;Westworld&#34; meets &#34;iRobot&#34; or &#34;AI&#34;.  Loved the video but back to the album.  Lot's of starpower on this album - Flo Rida, Sia, and Snoop Dogg to name a few.  A good mix of electronic music with A-list singers.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This is for the 60th Anniversary Edition, 2 disk set, one black&white, one color.<br /><br />Both disks are great! I don't know what anyone was talking about with &#34;pops&#34; in the audio. I heard no such thing.<br /><br />We did watch the black&white one first and didn't think we'd appreciate an altered (color) version. We were wrong. It was so realistic that we forgot we were watching an altered copy! Yet, I will probably still want to see it in B&W more often than not simply due to the fact that it is the &#34;original&#34;.<br /><br />Very happy with our purchase.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|This is hard going, but I am glad to be able to compare it with the play and movies. The formal prose is trying my patience.
B00004R99R|4.0|It might be considered a classic Disney movie by now, no? If not, it probably should be. It's got some classic themes and humor.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I love this book and the tv series!!!!! So good in couldn't put the book dOwn for days!! Can't wait:the next book!!
B008B8DY2O|5.0|Shantaram is an incredible book with so many life truths. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book & it comes highly recommended. My father read it three times & has been totally inspired to visit India. After having heard from various people that it is one of those must read books I finally read it over the December 2012 holiday. The writing is poetic filled with philosophical truths. But never boring. It paints a marvelous picture of India from a Western perspective. What I loved about it is that even though it is from a Western perspective it is one that is fully inclusive & embedded in the Indian culture. An absolute winner!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|A lot of SW fans are complaining about this, and I dont know why. This is a must-have box set, the packaging is beautiful. Just buy it, you will not regret it. NOTE: Amazon plays with the price of this, now it's 85$ but if you're patient you might get it at 70 or less, be alert! lol
B007L3BMGA|5.0|This book needs no review! Just read it! It is fabulous. A great book to remind you that you are a wonderful sexual being allowed to enjoy life to the full. I think each woman who reads this book sees herself in Mr Gray's arms ;)
B006LSZECO|4.0|A compelling read of a disturbing main character. Thoughtful, provocative and downright tricky! a well written book with a story that is too nasty to like.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Lot's O' Fun. I love it. Now I don't have to spend so much at the fair. Definitely recommend this game for all ages.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game. wish I didn't have to pay. could play it forever. g5 games are awesome. great storyline,  cant wait to finish the game.
B006LSZECO|4.0|the book held my attention almost to the end, then i was quite disapointed, kind of a big let down
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|I really liked Roman and Shanna in this book. Being a vampire fiction addict I have to say it was a very nice weekend read with a bit of action and good amount of lust in it! I haven't read all the reviews to know if anybody else feels this way, but I don't feel like I want to continue to the next book, knowing the main protagonists will be different in the next ones..
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If you liked the other you will like this one. I was sorry it see it end wanted to read more. Would recommend.
B007TBZ63Y|1.0|As a Riordan fan, I had looked forward to his latest in the Heroes of Olympus series. However, this book was a disappointment. There was nothing new. The characters were all the same and not at all interesting. The plot was uninspired. This was a &#34;middle&#34; book, in that, there wasn't a &#34;real&#34; ending. You need to read the next book to see what happened. I'm certain that I won't even remember what happened in this one by the time the next one comes out and I hate it when books end like that. I recognize that as an adult reader, this book was not written for me. However, I've read the others and found them entertaining. This one, not so much.
B004LSO7IS|5.0|Beautiful and talented actresses.  I love the way the storyline is set.  Was able to watch with my more romantic male friends who are open to the concept of soul mates.  Would recommend this to anyone.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Definitely worth staying up for, this was fun and entertaining, with plenty of light romance.  Characters were a bit one-dimensional, as is typical for the genre.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|I bought the Gigabyte motherboard, because I needed something that would run my [[ASIN:B005UBNLFK AMD FX-8150 8-Core Black Edition Processor Socket AM3+ FD8150FRGUBOX]].  This is the first time I've ever installed a motherboard and it couldn't have been easier.  I was especially afraid I'd have to flash it, but I got rev 3.0 and it runs beautifully.  I didn't have to flash anything.<br /><br />The board is well-labeled and it comes with great documentation that details all the ports and connectors.  It's step-by-step instructions for the complete novice.  I'm so glad I didn't have to go download a PDF or look at a file on a disk.  It even includes four SATA cables.  The SATA ports are side-facing, which threw me off for a second.<br /><br />The BIOS GUI is rich.  I'm used to the one from my old system, which did not allow me much control.  Here, everything is wide open.  I downloaded all my drivers, set one of the SATA ports to hot-plug. I set the boot priority and the temperature warning.  If I need help, it's all in the manual.<br /><br />Some things I noted:<br /><br />* works with Bulldozer<br />* 14 USB 2.0/1.1 ports (8 on back panel, 6 internal USB headers)<br />* 4 USB 3.0/2.0 ports (2 on back panel, 2 internal headers)<br />* 2x PCI Express X16 SLOTS, 2X PCI Express X4 slots, 2 PCI Express x1 slots, 1 PCI slot<br />* 2 eSATA connectors<br />* 6x SATA 6Gb/s connectors<br />* 4 x 1.5V DDR3 DIMM sockets up to 32 GB of memory<br /><br />This motherboard worked right out of the box.  Everything is running so smoothly with minimal effort for install.  I'm loving it.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|A highly addictive game with not only hidden objects but a plot that makes you think! a terrific advanced game!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's so cool and it teaches me how to take care of a horse. Maybe I can take care of a real horse. :) :) :)
B004F1F32A|5.0|Very enjoyable and suspenseful. A good movie. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Would recommend it . Not for young children
B0042RUMJG|5.0|Very good concert. Sound is great, the tracks / music played are typical Sting.  This is something I will watch and listen to numerous times.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|BEST REALLY THIS IS THE ONLY GAME I PLAY REALLY..,......,. I luv this game......:)But when I play it is to hard when surround.
B003D83DPA|1.0|This should not be called a blu ray.  I have never seen such a horrible picture. Sound is good, but this is blatant false advertising!!!
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen's unique humor is very evident in the book.  She is not only funny but strong and resilient even while facing adversity.
B003ICWTTM|5.0|This is a great concert and great blu ray. Probably my favorite concert that I have on blu ray. Sound is really good and the picture is just as good.
0425264351|4.0|My father in law told me that I just had to read the Jack Reacher series, because he knew how much I liked Mitch Rapp. So I decided to start with the first one, \\"Killing Floor\\". Even though this suspense novel was written in 1997, the author, Lee Child, wrote an excellent introduction last year. In it he gave some of his background and how Jack Reacher came to be.<br /><br />Jack Reacher is a \\"military brat\\" and he grew up on army bases all over the world. He went to West Point and then served in the Army Military Police. Jack gives his story in the first person and right off tells you he is just Jack, a simple name for a simple thinking man. Jack is big and tough and well trained; he tells you he had to be to hunt down and handle the military's AWOL. Now Jack is retired and is life is even more exciting, because he cannot stand evil and fights it when ever it appears.<br /><br />This story is not for the faint of heart and if you are going to fight evil with Jack, you have to have a stong constitution too. You will learn a little about counterfeiting and a lot about fighting bad guys. This a fast read, so hang on!!!
B003ELOQD4|1.0|Probably the worst concert I have of U 2.  This blu ray does not deliver and is a waste of money.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I like this app a lot and really enjoy the fact that i can add tracks and see the weather!  Good job and two thumbs up!
B000BTC5LW|4.0|This dvd is quite good. It would have been much better if it was redone in blu ray format with the upgraded sound.
B002RVCD6O|1.0|Not only is this version unfaithful to the book, it skips over some of the most important scenes and instead fills them with horrifically acted romantic scenes. I was hopeful this adaptation would have some worthwhile parts but they were few and far between.
B00064VR0W|1.0|I was really looking forward to this concert and after listening and watching, it was quite disappointing.  Not worth watching or buying.
B00ARAO720|4.0|This movie had a lot going on for it and should have done better at the box office in my opinion. I liked Joseph's character the most. The villain not so much and i felt some scenes could have been done better and not dragged out so much. I liked the simplicity of the plot and enjoyed the interactions between the characters although some should have had better lines.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|This concert is one of my favorite that I have. The sound and picture is impressive.  This is a good buy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very fun but would be nice to be more interactive with the horse but by far the best game for horse lovers.
B000UD08HW|2.0|Sound is really good, but the overall footage and music is not worth the purchase.  I was expecting a lot more.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies!  I cant wait for them to make another one!  Some people don't like it, but it really is an amazing piece of art!  The effects are amazing!  Visually this movie is out of this world!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a fun and it is a good way for kids to learn how to take good care of animals I am 10 years old and I love this game I highly recommend this game.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This is one of my kids favorites! And mine too! :) Very funny, very cute and has a great story!  Its not a violent movie, so if your looking for shooting and action this aint it.  Its just a good clean film thats safe for all ages!
B004DM0UII|4.0|a great way to explore a plethora of radio medium.  this app is a terrific addition to any. tablet.  I heartily recommend it
B003O86FMW|5.0|Riveting! Page turner! As good as this book is, I hope the idea of the games does not become popular again , as they were in
1611134900|5.0|A wonderful author who brought you into the story, and what a story. It made me cry but I loved it and so will others. I will be purchasing more from this author...wonderful.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Great show for the kids and fun for adults. The show had humor simular to Ice Age and Toy story.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|Love it! Finally a convenient method to stream video news from websites to my tv. Also YouTube! I am really happy and impressed with this app.
B009AVC922|5.0|This is by far the best anime that I've ever seen. I got this because a friend recommended it and I wish all the rest would stand up and take note. What a wonderful experience watching this movie!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|If you haven't seen Miracle of 34th Street, you're missing lots of happiness to be had during Christmas time. Such a great story that carries through so many different generations. I've watched this with my parents and grandparents since I was a kid, and will definitely watch it with my children someday!
B008B3EQPI|5.0|The third album by this ridiculously awesome band brings you more epic metal with influences from opera and tango theory. There is, literally, nothing else like it.
0817439390|5.0|Exposure can be a difficult concept for many amateur photographers to grasp, but this book does a great job at breaking down the components that create exposure in a way that is not confusing to readers. This is a great book for all photographers who are interested in wanting to learn more about exposure and the importance it plays in every image, film or digital.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|wish i would stop being cut off in the middle of them...lol.....fun to playand i hate whenit ends....cant wait for the next one to come out

B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book was a wonderful descriptive view of the next world we'll visit. It was sometimes too technical. It was totally convincing.

0374203032|5.0|A very welcomed perspective about the potential risks associated with the growing 'monetisation' of modern societies. Externalities and behaviors are at the core of Sandel's preoccupations and he delivers a very thoughtful account of the risks associated with discounting the consequences of certain business initiatives (Facebook comes to mind when it is a matter of dealing with deep relationships such as friendship).
B005HSL626|5.0|Fruit ninja is a fun and interactive game!!! It's it really addictive because I have been playing with it all last night for about 2 hours!!! I love slicing those fruits with my new cutter every time I at lease get when I beat my high score. My new cutter I have right now is the pretty piano one. Every time I slice a fruit, it plays a piano key!!!!! This app is free and I didn't waste any money. Love itttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt!!! Never ever will delete this game from my kindle fire hd! You have to get this awesome free game!!! This game is #1! You know what I'm going to slice those fruits right now! Bye!!!  (:
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Not crazy about this book. I kept thinking &#34;get on with it&#34;. I'm glad I didn't spend a lot of money on it.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I liked this book slot but there were moments were I didn't enjoy the writers way of writing but it was still a good book.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|I have read the series of Fifty Shades and I think it is a pity that so many books are being compared to it or using it as a promotion tool. I think it's a shame as many people who didn't enjoy it would not give this book a second glance after seeing that comparison. The only commonality between these two books is the addictive nature of them.<br />I inhaled Beautiful Disaster and played the scenes over in my head for ages after finishing the book.<br /><br />Travis and Abby's relationship is not perfect by far but the believable aspect of the story is in the imperfection of their love and how they have to fight for what they want. It's not often that I read a book where I root for the male character so much but there were times where I wanted to jump into the book and slap Abby and protect Travis from his heart break.<br /><br />I can not wait for Walking Disaster to come out!!!
B007M45PMU|5.0|I bought this based on recommendations having heard only Ho Hey. There are so many good songs here, Ho Hey isn't even the best. Flowers in your hair, Big Parade, and Dead Sea are all great. No duds in this album.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I had never even heard of this movie but it was very good! I think I am going to purchase it because I would definitely watch it again.
8866137626|3.0|It's a Moleskine notebook with an Evernote cover, a bunch of stickers, and the world's crappiest pen. (Seriously, it barely writes at all.) To find out what the stickers mean you have to go online and search the Evernote support site. So it's not like the package is well thought out. But on the bright side, you get to sample the Evernote Pro service.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Not as incredible as Hopeless, but well worth the read and I loved the characters and both books in the story, I cant wait to read more of her work.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|My wife and I have been together for 42 years and married for 39 of them. We thought the movie captured fairly well what can happen in a long term marriage and how a couple can draw apart and lose the close connection they once had. I usually don't like typical Hollywood fare and was surprised that I actually liked it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time.  Not my usually genre, but WOW was all I could say at the end, and then I wanted to start reading it again right away.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I haven't had the opportunity to really lug this thing around yet, but just from messing around with it for a bit, it's definitely a winner.  Tons of storage space.  Plenty of zippered compartments for cables/media cards/chargers, etc.  There's enough room in here for me to not only store my Nikon DSLR w/ 2 lenses, but also an HD camcorder.  Great price and great product for the price.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|on level 226 have 17939 coins. play 2x a day. done with all the puzzles. like I said. now what?  still like the game though.  good game to play when you don't want to think to much.but  should add more puzzles as your level increases.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This is as close as you will get to the real game for your tablet. Just wish they had more maps per game. cant wait.for ch.2!
B00328R21C|4.0|Chris is now on re-play! He enjoys role playing with these build up collections and he does show focus of intent. That makes for true playing.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I gave this book a four simply because I didn't  think it was as good as the first book. I will definitely be reading the third book soon.....
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the app makes it very easy to find what you are looking for in the bible quickly.and I got it in time to take advantage of free download of the NIV
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This app is so cool. it's well worth the upgrade to diamond level because you can import midi files to create an endless library of songs to play. Magic piano mode is really helpful for learning parts of harder songs that would frustrate otherwise.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|I liked this movie enougth to rent it but not enougth to buy it at new release prices. It was entertaining.
B006X5L6VS|5.0|Everything about this app is great except for if your tablet does not have a gps built in it is not useful. I bought this before i realized my tablet did not have a gps so it is not usable. bummer for me. its really cool on my iphone though and also on my friends nexus7 tablet though.
B0010AN7Y0|4.0|Fantastic movie, well made, great music, lots of  good acting, with a fine & classy British touch.  Highly recommended to thinking individuals.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The descriltion made the book sound fast paced and exciting and it was anything but,i thought it was really stupid and i cannot understand why it is on the best books list,Amazon i cannot trust u!
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I really liked this movie the battle screens are great. The cast has great chemistry not sure why it didn't do better.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|A really well written movie. I had no idea, until the last minute how it was going to end... which is a welcome change... what's more I didn't know how I wanted it to end. Sweet.
B00123IB32|5.0|I wish I was really fat so I could get a giant tattoo of Shane McGowan's face on my bulbous belly. Perhaps my belly button could be his mouth smoking a cigarette. Did he smoke? I would guess so.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I'm a family practice student, who ordered all my books from amazon. This year, I purchased a galaxy and downloaded the Kindle app with my books purchase. To my surprise after two weeks of use, I discovered the app does not support the talk to speech feature. Plus, you lock the book so I cannot use another application to read the books to me while I drive. I am so disappointed in amazon for not explaining it is not a feature of the app. Upon calling, I was told, \\"I could purchase a kindle\\" (it really is a piece of crap for my personal lifestyle). Other company's such as Kino and playbooks offer the feature. I was an avid customer of amazon, and now will refuse to purchase anything further from your company. I have also explained to all the students in my program, who pay over a 1000.00 a semester for books, to not purchase the kindle books because it lacks the read out loud feature. What a disappointment and waste of my time and money. I am sad to say I will no longer purchase from amazon and suggest other students don't either. Go with a company that offeres the same book at the same price with a feature made for busy students
B007MU85D0|5.0|I seriously have listened to this album on loop for at least a week now. It's just so... perfect. Some of the instrumentals sound soooo much like Edward Sharpe, but that's ok.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I enjoyed it, didn't have any expectations other than watching the preview and it was really excellent.  Definitely worth the watch.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Les Miserables was one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen.  If I were rating the movie, I'd be asking how to give it 6 stars.  However, the long days of shooting while singing did cause vocal strain for the actors (can you sing for 10 hours straight?).  You can hear that strain in the soundtrack.  Additionally, it is only highlights, and some of my favorites are not recorded.  That being said, for a real fan, this is well worthy having in your collection.
B007SGM084|4.0|The books held my interest because of the great plot.  The sex was a bit much and unreal.  I would recommend these books only to close friends.
B00457WZEI|3.0|So, I saw the play with its amazing horse puppets!!  But I thought the story seemed a little thin and felt it was a good idea to read it.  Wow, did they ever change the story for the play!!  But frankly, the story was still thin.  Perhaps it is because this book is aimed at young people, and is told from the horse's point of view, but frankly, I've read Black Beauty as an adult, and find it to be far the superior book.  Still, most young readers know nothing of the First World War and it's horrific collision of modern warfare technology and old warfare tactics.  So I do think it could serve as a lesson.  I'm just not sure I could get the young readers in my family interested enough to finish it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love.  sub way surfed because. it makes me feel. like I'm. really in new York every day and every time I play
B00AYB0SX4|5.0|I had seen the trailer and it scared me every time it came on TV, so I wiki'd it and read through the synopsis.<br /><br />I figured, eh, I can watch it without being scared now.<br /><br />....It still got me.<br /><br />I still screamed and felt nervous, even though I already knew what was going to happen.<br /><br />I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a little scare :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love flow. I've. got past every level in the game and it makes. me feel good. about my self and good
B005SN3VA0|5.0|The novelty of this film is the plot and premise. That alone was engaging. Add to that some very fine acting  by relative newcomer Brit Marling with excellent support by William Mapother and we have a winning formula. Character development is great as is the cinematography. The genre would be a blend of sci-fi and a human interest story. The treatment of this film by the director makes it all seem very plausible.  A highly successful high school graduate slated for greater things is guilty of an auto accident resulting in multiple deaths and some prison time thus destroying her whole trajectory. Once out of prison and with her family she must gradually rebuild while deciding to find some way to atone for what happened. This atonement quest becomes her focus and that of the film as well.  It's a small indie type film be I found it quite engaging and stuck with it. The ending is the only let down but not that bad -- it leaves it up to the viewer to imagine after providing some evidence of how that will go.
B005XY67WI|5.0|Shakira at her finest! Simply vintage Shakira doing what she does best. The Blu-Ray quality is outstanding. You will not go wrong in purchasing this.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Though I only got this book to preview for my daughter (11 going on 17), and quickly realized only my 17 year old could read it (due to the sexual content), and as a YA book, completed it in a few hours, I have to agree with other reviewers that this is a story that vividly describes the pain of a young girl's loss and the burden  she carries in trying to decide to fight for life and her future (courage) or to let go and escape the pain of thAt future without those she loves (cowardice). I was surprised when the book ended, but loved it.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|entertaining and informative<br />does what it is designed to do, can't complain about cost<br />great way to use a few minutes here and there
B003PJ6UHA|3.0|This book certainly makes you consider physics from a new viewpoint. It's general  arguments seem reasonable but I missed more explanation on the &#34;next level down&#34; details.
0765325950|1.0|I was born in 1990, so I had to do some catching up when I was little. I began reading this series when I was 9, and I can't believe it's finally over. I eagerly awaited the release of this book, and even sent Sanderson an email complimenting his work on the previous one.<br /><br />That being said, I'm giving this a 1 star. No way in hell am I waiting around for 3 months for it to come out on the Kindle. I live on a college campus, and the book store CLOSED because people just don't buy hard books anymore.<br /><br />If I were a PIRATE, I might be inclined to drive all the way down to the BAY to find a new book store. But I'm not. Sorry, but you won't get my money with a release like this. It's not coming out for ebooks because \\"[Harriet] feels uncomfortable with [them]\\" ?????????? Screw that.
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|I am not sure how to describe this artist and his songs because I feel they do not do justice to how beautiful the songs are and how talented Ben Howard is. This is finally an artist that I know I will listen to for many many years to come. The lyrics are so wonderful and sad at the same time like in Black Flies. I would recommend this to anyone who would like to listen to real music and actual talent.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun game. The chores,  training and competitions are entertaining and fun. Save your gems for things you cant earn and you will enjoy this game.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|Toy Story 2 builds magnificently on the originaly Toy Story movie.  Woody is accidentally sold in a yard sale to end up with a collector who wants to ship him and new characters, a complete set, to a museum in Japan.  Worried about not being loved forever by Andy, Woody sees an opportunity to always be admired.  His friends come to the rescue and a tough choice is made.  This is a rare sequel where it's better than the first.  Godfather has nothing on this well-written gem.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I'm delighted to be able to read books on my Android via Kindle!  I like everything the program allows me to do with books, especially the highlight and search features.  It wasn't as simple to download as other apps.  Also, some more work needs to be done on the search feature.  Once you have a search list and you click on an item in that search, you can't get back to the original search list.
B005H29GSI|1.0|This game is virtually impossible to set up the way the instructions indicate it should, since the hollowed out sections of the wooden planks are not thin enough for the pigs to rest on properly. The dynamite crate doesn't properly \\"explode\\" (you have to drop it from several feet high for it to work, and even then it doesn't always pop open). The hardhats are weighted awkwardly which makes set-up even more difficult. The slingshot is biased to shoot straight up, and if you want to shoot at a lower angle, it doesn't have enough 'oomph'. My kids love playing with it, but they treat it more like an imaginative playset than a game.<br /><br />The set up time outweighs the \\"satisfaction\\" of using the slingshot, like building a sandcastle for 3 hours and then having someone kick it over. It's tedious and boring.
B005OHSD3A|4.0|I have the Diet Revolution, which I personally think the science and Dr. Atkins approach is straight forward, which I liked. The new book is good with less scientific tone and is worth purchasing for not only the new breakthroughs but an easier read. Bought one also for a family member who would not have the patience to read Diet Revolution. All in all, Atkins books are complementary. The major difference between this book and Dr Atkins Diet Revolution is that you are very much encouraged to eat lots more veggies than the older plan. You can also customize your plan at a higher carb level depending on your goals and taste preferences. Vegetarians can even jump into the low carb lifestyle.
B0015LBYMQ|5.0|My son loves John Mayer.  He says this is one of his finest works.  He has truly enjoyed listening to it
B00866JL96|4.0|The  trauma that our recent and current wars have on young men who fight and the struggle to heal. It is a film that those who encourage war in Political leaders particulary in our senate and congress who nave no sonsor daughter see and ask to you really think war is worthmthis pain if you do why don't they enlist and go?<br />A film odf reflection, not the best but certainly a good attempt!
B00AL8F5EM|5.0|I am bilingual and now raising a bi- or trilingual baby and it's not always easy. This book gave me plenty of ideas and I really recommend it to anyone who wants to bring up their children with more than one language at home. Not only it gives different scenarios so I am sure most of us find answers for our particular case in the book but also the fact that it is so practical and can be read in only a few hours is a real bonus!!!
B006WJ0332|4.0|The components of this drama  are love, reparation and redemption and change.<br /><br />There is action, racial and respect owed to women/.<br /><br />The Question - What is the role of sex in a relationship and its meaning- rarely touch on or exam - the only thing parents generally say and religious leaders is don't which isd nmopt positive or helpful since many who are teaching or proting sex never exam orb explore with the coming of age of the young.<br /><br />Commitment
B0084U0IEG|5.0|This was a really exciting and well-written book.  The characters were likeable; story engaging and literary references so much fun.
B000I9W08I|4.0|Barbara Streisand and Louie Armstrong in a smash hit. The performing dancers and the singer were excellent. I loved the whole show, although part of the taping seemed to freeze near the end.
B008MEM24S|5.0|it is super fun and super addicting whenever I have to clean my room I cant stop playing. I have been playing for the past 2 hours.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wonderfully entertaining! I could not put it down! Rushing off to finish this trilogy right now! This series is truly, a must read!
B007SOQBCM|4.0|Overall, it's pretty good. It's easy to navigate and browse games/streams. I wasn't able to find an option to login to my Twitch account though, which would be nice so I could find streams I watch on a regular basis instead of browsing through active ones. The search seemed a bit weird though, with streams that it found in relation to what I had typed in. I'll have to play around with it a bit more because I may have been searching within the incorrect game for the stream I was looking for.    A nice feature would be an \\"Open in app\\" button when attempting to view a Twitch stream through the web browser. With the Kindle Fire HD not using Flash, and Twitch not having an HTML5 video version yet, it would be nice for this feature. I use a gaming community website to find currently active streams of players I enjoy watching. An \\"Open in app\\" feature would be handy to use that to find the stream I want without having to close Silk, open the App, and then search for it.    Update: Twitch has updated their app so it is much better now. You can login to your account and find streams that you can follow along with various games and such. Overall Twitch has been improving their products both via the computer and via mobile. There still is no HTML5 player for streams inside a webpage but I do hear they are moving towards that eventually. I'm leaving it at 4 stars because you cannot access a streamers past broadcasts or highlights through the app. Once they add that it definitely would be a 5 stars. I still recommend getting this app for watching gaming streams.
1481251880|3.0|Well written but:<br />Sky appeared older than 17.<br />Extremely disturbing.<br />There should be a disclaimer in the beginning about sexual abuse! Disgusting.<br />Holder was too good to be true in a sense.<br />I wept.<br />I needed a break after I read it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I came upon this series after asking for suggestions of sci-fi genre books on [...] .  There were several recommendations that had warmly included this series into their lists.  I was intrigued by this, and so I decided this would be the first addition, regardless of my anticipation of other titles.  I began reading it right away, and now I'm writing this, days later after nonstop reading.  I hope the best for Hugh Howey, and deeply and truly hope for more books!
B00005N6KG|5.0|Use exclusively on daily walk attached to Walkman. Very good sound for a $10 headset. Can never get any earbuds to stay in place, so a headset is a must. This one is very light weight and adjustable.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|A group of us meet every week and play &#34;Quiddler.&#34;  We have been playing word games for about 6 years and adopted the Mirriam-Webster Dictionary as the official word checker.  I am the designated person to carry it.  Now with it on my kindle, I no longer have to carry the hard cover (heavy) copy.  What a joy!  Plus, a number of us have loaded it on our phones, etc., so if one forgets it, there are still 4 or 5 more copies.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed reading all 3 \\"hunger games\\" books, very exciting and keeps u interested.  I enjoyed the books much more than the movie
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Who the heck was he writing for  - other neurologists?  Too much medical talk - I assume so it would show how a really intelligent 'guy' would have a NDE.
B008NA2JMQ|4.0|Very exciting, seemingly truthful and great to see how the mega-rich Wall Street bankers lived during the boom! A really great read
B000SW4DXK|5.0|This is a great movie and we needed to replace our old VHS version.  This was a great price for a great movie.
B0031RS2I6|5.0|English comedy at its best. Wodehouse is a genius. My second of the Jeeves and Wooster series and looking forward to reading more
B0053O89RY|5.0|The whole family loves this show.  We already have both the first and second season's on DVD so this now completes the set.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|A really great summer read. Fits in nicely with 20th century history, has a great protagonist and has a memorable message that saying 'yes' is the best way to live.
031604461X|4.0|This book was bought from the new category and came in great condition. The cover was not what I had expected but still a very good purchase.
B0058PJ6NE|3.0|Can any tell me how to access my channel with You Tube Pro? I have  a lot of favorites on You Tube (on the PC) but I cannot seem to bring those up on Kindle Fire. Instead I get a list of videos I have no interest in.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|I enjoyed this book from beginning to end and now need to buy the rest of the series. Great fantasy book.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Being a long time eBay buyer and seller, I enjoy the convenience of checking on any item in 'watching' and browsing through favorite categories for newly listed items. Big Thumbs up for this App.
B00AYDC3CG|3.0|A rather bland and predictable film even though it is for younger audiences.  Tim Burton must have had a screwed up childhood!!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Not a day goes by that I don't check the weather conditions for the current day and for the upcoming days. In my region, knowing what kind of weather is coming at us is optimal.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Delightfully happy and sad. The author is deep and great at portraying emotion. I need to put seven more words.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|For a John Grisham novel is was a good read, but not great. I was not fond of the outcome with the main characters. In short the story comes off as 'continued corruption is okay'. Well, that is what we are dealing with regarding our current politicians so I presume the moral to the story is 'corrution in politics will be with us forever'.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised about this book.  The story is about an astronaught who gets stranded on Mars.  The mission was supposed to be short-term but turns into a long-term struggle for survival.  The main character is ingenious and resourceful.  Another surprise bonus it the characters sarcasm which helps the story keeps it momentum.
B0063GORYU|2.0|I enjoy playing Spider Solitaire but on the Kindle Fire the play area is too small....the eyes start complaining after one round. There is not much more I can say about it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's addicted and fun . Great work to who ever created this amazing app . It's great on my kindle . To spare some time . Amazing .
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I have to write this review for my husband who gets the biggest kick out of this game and with help of our grandson, my souse is acing one level after another. Now my best friend's spouse is hooked as well. The downside to this game is the rapid depletion of battery life.
B001AW156U|5.0|Double tap here... Triple tap here... Light touch... Quick kill... Makes life a bit easier for the fingers. Simple snap on and it stays put.
B005VZQ95O|4.0|Pink Floyd is my all-time favorite rock music. However, the compilation of this CD cuts off intro music and fade outs, cheating the seasoned listener of the full cut.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Great flick.  Robert Downey Jr. really makes the movie.  But the rest of the cast is awesome, too. Must see.
B009346RSS|5.0|This is a great product to convert your digital signal to an analog with almost no lag in sound for old or with no fiber optic inputs on old surround systems.
B005HSG3VK|1.0|I received a kindle fire HD, for christmas. when i orderded it i did not know the size would be different, i cant use this case , i really hate that it didnt fit I dont hate the product, just that i made a mistake about not knowing about the size of my kindle.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|ok fine it is not the worst book that ive ever read .<br />still i read all other books in the real book.<br />this is expensive<br /><br />and
B004DM0UII|5.0|I love the different genres of music to chose from. you select your choice of music, and the station just provide you with such great selections.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Old retired female comic book nut as a kid loved this movie.  Loved it at the theater and on Blue Ray.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A very awesome book..working on the second one now and it is just as good as the first so far..I recommend this book very much to anyone over the age of 18. I think it is just a little bit too much for a younger person. Best book I have read in along time for sure.
B007EE5820|5.0|This book is really great delving into the life of this action star turned governor of California. The readers learn about Arnie's life from his childhood in Austria to his time as governor of California and everything inbetween. I definitely recommend for any Arnold Schwarzenegger fan.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I really liked the  book, it reminds  me a lot of his book the notebook. The ending took me by surprised but still wouldn't of wanted it to end any other way. It's a must read.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another good one.  Nicholas Sparks has a true gift.  I enjoyed the characters and reading about their relationship as it unfolds.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This game is not the best compared to the pc full version but for the price its decent for ur phone and tablet. For my game I don't have have a pause button so if any could help me with that. I reccomnd it
1452110581|5.0|This book is super adorable! When I read the poems, I immediately thought of my cat.  This is a cute gift for any cat lover.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|These are not only erotic, but funny, dramatic and will pull heart strings.  If you read the first, you have to finish all three!  The Trilogy should be a prerequisite for all couples considering marriage.
B008VJYWMY|5.0|This new collection is astounding! Many new songs which will be recognized by any listener, from the theme song from &#34;The Titanic&#34; ,&#34;My Body Guard&#34; and even a contribution from the music of Elvis Presley, along with other previous Il Divo favorites. When I have the time to really sit and listen to just this album, It dominates my listening and I find I am listening with not just my ears, but my whole body. it is like a massage for your whole being!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Easy read, thought provoking, medically substantiated. Regardless of your current faith status, an interesting moving read that is worth your time.
6305308659|5.0|Having seen this movie when it first appeared on TV, it is one that sticks as it presents the contrasts in what we think is necessary and what is possible.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|Great item. FANtastic video.<br />Does the job well.<br />Nice transaction and great seller.<br />I would recommend this item to anyone who needs one of these.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Snow and Coin, one and the same. Peeta and Katniss, yin and yang. Prim was always going to die. Fate demanded it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Always get so wrapped up in the story it's always a surprise when the book ends. I Enjoy al the stories that Mr. Connelly has written, but I like Harry Bosch the most.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|My first movie theater experience was a Jurassic Park / Free Willy double feature at a drive-in. Jurassic Park inspired my imagination and I've loved the series ever since. All 3 movies look and sound awesome on Bluray, and you'll get a lot of mileage out of the collection.<br /><br />I wonder if Free Willy held up this well?
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Very good. I like all the action and history. Hope the author writes another book to continue the story. This book is good for tweens and up.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I saw the many reviews and thought it would be a good workout because I just love Jillian Michaels.  I was prepared for a tough workout but nothing prepared me for what happened 5 minutes into the workout. I was doing lunges making sure I was in proper form. Basically that my knee was not over my toes. I am not sure what happened but next thing I know I topple over and my knee pops out of joint. No one else was home so I had to put it back in joint.  Very painful!!! Had to wear a knee brace. Took about 6 weeks to recover to the point where I could not rely on someone else to help me get up or where I could kneel on the floor without it hurting.  I do eventually plan to do her dvd again but will skip the lunges.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Worth the money! This game delivers what I have come to expect from G5, great graphics, entertaining story lines and decent play time.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I usually hate zombie movies, but this show has a wealth of character development! I can't wait for the season to resume.
B007TR1R22|3.0|I've read some of the other reviews here at amazon and this film has been polarizing for the reviewers. In one camp are those who have been in hopeless love situations and appreciate this faithful recreation of it here. On the other, are those who find the unrelieved misery depicted devoid of entertainment value.<br /><br />Rachel Weisz plays this woman who seemingly lives on knife's edge of suicidal despair.  She is very good playing her but it is a role I would not have otherwise pictured her in as she herself is quite robust and bold in her other roles and in life. So I suppose she has really shown her range of ability by playing this role.  She is a big, big talent,<br /><br />However, all this said, it is hard to develop either sympathy or empathy for her character or for the men in the story. She is incredibly passive,  She is also very idle and cannot rouse herself to care about anything but her love life.  I realize this is set back in time but still there were women who managed to rise above their love disappointments and do things with their lives to make them worthwhile. I would hazard a guess that there were a lot of women in England at that time who had married out of duty rather than love so she was hardly alone in her status. And one can reasonably bet that these women did not mostly look like the beautiful Rachel Weisz.<br /><br />Another viewer mentions the screeching violin over the opening of the film and I too wondered how this melodramatic overkill had made it into a quality feature film.  It goes on and on and on until you feel like shouting, \\"Enough.\\"<br /><br />I have spent most of my viewing life preferring art house and film festival fare. In Bergman's hands, for example, you felt art triumph over sad subject matter such as in the classic WILD STRAWBERRIES.  Here there is all the wallowing in despair but no transcedence by achieving a work of art in the making of the film.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B001AQO3QA|5.0|Just a fan of these classics and loved the behind the scenes episodes on how all were made. I found the uncut version of Alien 3 a complete trip
0765325950|5.0|I found it difficult to rate this book by itself because there is so much more there than a book. Like many, at first I was put off by the lack of an E book because these days I find it difficult to read any text on printed paper. But when I reached the last few chapters of this book several things came to mind.<br /><br />If there was no ebook because harriett had her own reason and design, I've come to realize I am ok with it. She did it for her husband, his work and his memory. This is her project. This story belongs to her and her husband. How many of us would turn down the opportunity to do whatever we can to raise the memory of the most important person in our lives? Whether omitting the ebook was the right thing to do is not for us to decide. We should respect her wishes.<br /><br />This ending was exhilarating, epic, wonderful and heart breaking. Whether it answers all of your questions, has plot flaws and or mechanical errors is irrelevant. Those little distractions does not take away the story for me. Yes, the series hit a rough patch in the middle and I was as critical as any but for me the whole series was more than a journey of reading a book. My life was wrapped around it.<br /><br />When I read book 1 of WOT, I wore glasses for my nearsightedness. I finished the last book wearing glasses for farsightedness. When I read the horn of valere blown for the first time, barely anyone had cell phones. My nieces were not born yet and now they prepare for college. I think about friends and loved ones who were there when I started reading this who are no longer with me. I think about where I was in life and how drastically different it is now. I lived, saw the world, almost died and lived again. I can't believe how great life is that I lasted long enough to read this last book. And like in life I can overlook those little nagging minor issues and those patches of boredom. Because the books as a series and my life as a whole is pretty damn good.<br /><br />Thankyou Mr. Jordan and Mr. Sanderson
B009NOVCSS|5.0|bought for my husband for Christmas, he spent hours looking over the postcards and book, loved the cd's. Great for Stone's fans.
0385342063|5.0|Let me say it straight.  This was one fun book!  I smiled and laughed a lot while reading Kinsella's newest novel.  Poppy was every woman and I can't imagine a person not finding something to relate to in her character.  She lost her engagement ring in a \\"let me try it on\\" shuffle between friends.  Her cell phone got snatched by a rotten thief.  So then, her only option was to take that cell phone abandoned in the trash can.  Right?  Here's the thing, would you really answer it--honestly--when someone called?  I would be too nervous to take those calls, but Poppy pulled it off in a pretty hilarious way.<br /><br />I loved Poppy, but once she met up with the owner of the abandoned phone, Sam Roxton, the story took an entirely different turn.  Sam is your stereotypical serious, driven, and stern businessman.  Somehow though, Poppy's witty personality became a great sparring partner as she convinced him to let her hold onto that phone and even forward his important calls and emails to him.  Then what do you do?  Well, spy on his life--of course!<br /><br />I really enjoyed I've Got Your Number for all of its laughable moments.  Honestly, I haven't seen an author capture flirting as authentically as Kinsella did in this novel.  There is that funny moment where flirting is just what you naturally do, to what you really want to do, to what you can no longer do because you like someone too much.  Somehow, she captures it all.  It's been awhile since I read a chick lit that had me smiling and laughing aloud this much.  If you've read Kinsella's novels before, I would definitely compare this to some of her other stand alone novels like The Undomestic Goddess.  If you liked those, then you have to give this a shot!
B000SEGTI0|3.0|This bears only a causal resemblance to Bladerunner. There are androids, hover cars, dilapidated cities, the empathy test, and some action. I found it amusing that even with all the technology, PKD still has the main character using pay phones. The idea that owning a real animal over an electronic one is a key plot mover. I rated it three starts because the tech is outdated.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|HOPELESS is very good book....I read it in 2 days.  I am going to have to read more Colleen Hoover books.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|The reason that I gave this book this rating is because it was short and the beginning was quite rocky. I liked everything about this book, and if I were to change a thing I would not change anything. I would recommend this book for people who like adventure books.  Thanks
B009CPES4I|5.0|This is a wonderful, feel good movie!  I recommend it to anyone who is looking for some laughs and a happy ending.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I have read many books but no others have made me want to read from hunger games to divergent. Even I am number 4 series. This is the best book for teens and adults who have that geeky side.
B00002SSKI|5.0|Love this movie!! When I lost my VHS copy I just had to replace and this was an awesome price
B00APUQH0W|5.0|This movie was just what I needed.  A little taste of baseball while I wait for Spring Training to start, and some thought-provoking scenes for someone nearing retirement.  It's not technically a baseball movie, so don't look for a lot of detail in that area, but it offers some excellent perspectives on relationships and priorities -- all done in a baseball setting.  Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams are both great!
B0097HSS4M|5.0|OMG! I WISH I had like a I pod or I pad or some thing. all I have is a kindle. !!!!!!  I really want this app but what's the point...  :(
B007HJ9LXE|5.0|We watched this in conjunction with a book group discussion of The Lacuna by Barbara Kingsolver.  It was very informative.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|good game but I like the other ones better. I just don't really like star wars. and way over priced. plus all these angry bird games are the same expet thy r just like dressed up
B0076DELIG|2.0|Not up to usual standards. Ripped from newspaper. Rehash. All right to read, but perfer his other books. Harry slips up.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I was playing then I quite few seconds later my kindle. shut Dow reatarted then it deleted all of my data and money and people everything.
B0017SWSCW|3.0|All in all, OK.  Certainly not one of Archer's best.  Glad I read it and it doesn't discourage me from reading his new works.
B0086700CM|5.0|I LOVE TEMPLE RUN!!!!! It is awesome! You should totally get it!  I really like it! Do you like it?
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This movie was great but the boom was better.  Loved reading it.  Being from Philly I liked reading the eagles scenes.  Read it and see the movie but note that while similar the book tells a better story
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game has absolutely beautiful graphics! The next best thing to having a real horse :) Feed,  groom, train and compete with realistic horses!
B004HYDM0A|1.0|A sad movie with sad protagonists that run into a sad character. The \\"twist\\" is predictable, slow and leaves you with disappointed feeling.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Keeps engrossed and very interesting. I like the challenge with the blocked and frozen ones. For now it's my favorite game. Would like to have more levels.
B0073PPNE8|5.0|I would rent through amazon again<br />The film it self was fantastic<br />I highly recommend see it<br />Great period feel
1609611543|5.0|I didn't start doing this because of any illness. I read the book and started the wheat belly diet cut out the wheat in your diet) in order to maintain a healthy weight. It's not that difficult to eat this way and I have maintained the weight. I lost 10 pounds the first two weeks and have kept off. I also sleep better and have not had any sickness of any kind, all winter, not even a cold (knock on wood).
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun for the whole family . We had a great time as a family playing this game. If you like search games this is a good one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just got the game tonight and so far has been really fun to play. The graphics have been really impressive.
B0006J28BO|5.0|First off the delivery was speedy and my disk was not broken or scratched in any way, which can sometimes happen when you buy things online. The film is over all a great one to add to my collection, having already a number of Studio Gibli films in my home. I was rather happy when I recognized many of the voices of the English cast, featuring Anne Hathaway, Cary Elwes, and Peter Boyle (may he rest in peace) as just a few examples. Lastly the price which was the reason I purchased from Amazon and not a different distributor. In the past Studio Gibli films have gone for upwards of $24,<br />All in all a great film to add to anyone's collection.
B0055V6EZE|4.0|It was a surprise to me to hear this rough voiced actor could actually sing Blues as well as do an excellent job on piano and guitar. Some off us have It, some of us don't..  Hugh has it!
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|be a good game if it didnt lose stuff all the time. resets itself and you lose gold, units, and levels.
B000000XB8|5.0|What a great record, shipping was good no damage to product, sitting here now listening to this great record on my turntable here in Aus.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|This is an entertaining game, that gives you a little challenge. It doesn't take hours of time to build your hero or inventory. You just start playing.
B004LROUNG|4.0|It has the typical Grisham feel, but is a little slower than most of his novels.  This one has more of a social feeling than just a crime solving one.  It does have several smaller stories, within a story, but none are thrilling, but rather heartwarming at most.
B007R41E8O|3.0|There is no way to play this game without hints! You travel back and forth for one dumb thing, time and time again, to the point where I thought it had to be a joke. There were a lot of hidden object rooms, then you would have to go back to them and do it all over again with a new list for another item! Graphics were great, some of the Puzzles were fun, when you got them
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It's been a while since I read something so dramatic,romantic and inspiring all at the same time.  Characters are so realistic, and believable. Very few stories like this one.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. It was challenging yet not too much to ruin the fun. You don't get penalized for using the hint button and it had a good story.  REALLY GOOD! Would like to see sequel.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wonderful books. I was caught off guard off guard because I didn't know what the books were about. Instead I kept reading.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This story without words is perfect for bedtime. The boy wakes up one snowy day & builds a snowman....that night the snowman comes to life & they have many adventures! A memorable featurte of this movie is the beautiful music.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Worst thing I have seen in a long time! Junk! It will be returned ASAP this week.  I would prefer to continue using my old one rather than be seen with this trash.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This is a great book!<br /><br />Great excellent good pretty inspiring . Mark twain is best writer ever. Go tom sawyer
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|It was a present to my older sister, she loved it! Great gift packaging. Now I'm stuck with her singing.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Dr. Alexander III told a very interesting story but I found that he seemed to be more involved with the medical and physiological aspects of his experience that his emotional experience.  Rather than giving an emotional description I felt like I got a clinical description of his journey.  It was still an interesting read.  I have a medical background and that information was fine but that was not what I expected to find.
1451695195|4.0|Reassuring  for me. I found Alexanders book convincing, informative and exciting. Especially important because he has a neurological research background.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I loved this game but when i tried to play it was black and it went straight to the homepage:(
