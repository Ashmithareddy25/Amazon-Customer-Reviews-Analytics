B005VMKP8O|5|First, I ride an 07 cbr1000rr - I love speed and leaning<br /><br />These are great boots/shoes. I live in Texas. Hot/cold between seasons.<br /><br />Heat - they don't overheat your feet. Somehow my feet stay somewhat cool. Superb grip, shifting is awesome. Plenty thick for protection, but I can still feel the pegs/shift lever/break lever as if I were wearing running shoes.<br /><br />Cold - they keep feet warm. They still flex well in the cold, only enough as needed.<br /><br />City - totally comfortable to walk around in at meets or whatever else. Feel great, plant well, flex just enough. Cover ankle like high tops.<br /><br />Riding (general) - high ankle doesn't rub, stay tight with rad design. Look wicked awesome. Super easy to put on/take off. (some bikers are lazy - me) They stay pretty darn clean even when riding in the city through construction. Even then, easy to clean. The toe has special shift pad that works like a charm.<br /><br />The only con - not enough colors! These are awesome! I want more!<br />Slightly narrow, works easily for me with normal or average feet.<br /><br />Try them! Recommend them to others out there!
B0002L2MMG|5|Have to use restraint with these. Very clear with noise cancelling only and power off or very  low. Has survived use.
B00662CGYY|5|plenty of material, very well made, just as the original, 3m glue easy to install 28 feet long good buy
B00IKMC6M0|5|We had a fantastic fan in our last travel trailer and loved it.  We downsized to a camper on our truck and replaced a simple vent with this fan.  It was easy to install and works great!  In a smaller space, it REALLY moves some air - it is not noisy as some of the reviews stated. Good price, too - would recommend!
B000S2MP08|4|very hi quality
B001QVTIM8|5|I think many of the reviewers had unrealistic expectations of what to expect.  Universal means it can be adapted to most situations, not that it is going to be exactly the same as factory.  I have used this kit now on three cars,  an International Scout, an MG Midget and a MGB.  You need a good strong set of wire cutters or dykes to trim the cable and it's housing.  The plastic pieces that elicited complains are designed to snap in a few different pedals to seat the cable end,  if you are using them somewhere else you likely doing something wrong.  If you put thought into how you run the cable to avoid binding and such,  give yourself a little adjust-ability and make sure to keep pedal travel in mind,  this should work for your too.  It also looks great.
B000BNZ7JK|1|Bought this bumper a few years ago and it started rusting right away.  I have to use steel wool and then wax it to try to keep in check but the chrome is such poor quality it's a losing battle.  Too bad because it's a neat looking bumper when new.
B008BCELBS|5|These LEDs are very bright and the price is right. Shared some of these with friends for dome lights and they like them. These were shipped right away - good seller!
B000BN3A4Y|4|I purchased two of these, one for each vehicle. The mounting bracket is simple. The hammer is light weight and very bright orange. It has a very sharp point on it and looks like it will do the job. It's about what I expected. I wish it was a little heavier.
B00BGZMXWG|2|The purpose of a digital meter is to provide more accuracy than a needle meter. This one is off by .4 volts (almost a half a volt, therefor no better than non digital) Waiting 4plus weeks also is a deal breaker
B00076HM9E|5|I had a leaky regulator on my travel trailer.  Ordered this one from Amazon, and it fixed it right up.
B000R308RA|2|Have some led that already burned out after only a few months. Otherwise looks good.
B0024ECCJW|1|returned for refund, item did not work
B001AWLTX4|5|Love the looks from all the helicopter moms in the neighborhood!
B000CO9EII|2|Weak material.
B003YJ8TVQ|4|It works well in my car and use the USB for my Iphone. Both outlets make it easier to run multiple items at the same time. I leave it attached all the time. I wish the BESTEK lighted up but lights inside outlets let one see.
B00825ZBAE|1|First Off I am a huge K&N filter customer and CAI’s, I have been for 20 years. I have them on all of our vehicles so I bought one for our SRT 2015 Challenger. The tube and bracket assembly does not fit properly. The IAT does not fit the grommet. So I went down and purchased a bunch of different size grommets to get it to fit. I put it on and went and test drove. The car was an average of .3 seconds slower from 0-60 and 26hp less (if you can believe the onboard torque and HP gauges). So I put the stock setup back on within in 10 minutes and tested again. I got my 0-60 times back and HP back. Even by seat of the pants feel the car even felt slower with it.  I contacted K&N and explained this to them to get their take. They have not even had the decency to contact me back to take a hike, tell me I’m wrong or whatever. It confirms my results. So that will be the last time I buy K&N. If they would have contacted me back, explained. Great. I would still buy. There are other companies just as good as they are.  It’s a waste of money on a 2015 6.4 Hemi SRT. The factory setup works pretty well. I have youtube videos of dyno results on our 2010 RT Challenger, our 2005 RT Magnum that did show an increase in performance with their CAI kits, I ran before and after. I run their filters on my 3 older muscle cars, 2 trucks, and a Hayabusa so by no means would I bash them if I didn’t feel it’s legitimate.  Update: K&N contacted me back and they offered a full refund. So I am at least happy about that. I hope to resolve the fitment issues and loss of power rather than get a refund. It doesn't change my star rating, but it will keep me as a customer. Other people seemed to have good luck on the other years of SRT's.
B0006Z9SPW|5|We have three vehicles so it made more sense to get the bargain container. I prefer using it straight from the bottle rather than refilling the sprayer. The product stays on the applicator and doesn't get all over the rest of the vehicle like it does when using the spray bottle.
B005PZXQKG|5|good product and fair price
B006EGAIII|5|These do a nice job getting the car off the ground far enough that I can change oil.  That's right I change my own oil cause I am a man and not some metrosexual that is afraid to get my hands dirty.  They are nice and light and can be stacked so they don't take up room in my garage.
B008ESJK92|5|Excellent buy, so I asked what I received, I am very satisfied, good quality item at a great price. I recommend
B001EP0HGC|4|Had to flip upside down for more road clearance. Nice, heavy and strong.
B005FIAVO2|5|Fino
B007AONLZK|5|Accurate description and arrived just as they said.  Installation was a breeze and they worked great!  No they worked better than the factory ones!
B007Y5DBS2|5|easy to use, good fit.
B001ACE2II|4|Excelente.
B004O9WC18|5|Perfect fit, finish and looks great.
B00CPJTGYK|3|5 star price, good fit but they are excessively noisey. I use them on my 14 FLHR at this price I will deal with the noise. I ride too many miles to pay 5 times this price from Harley
B002NGCO30|5|this is a fun unit to use I enjoyed it very much from the beginning I have charged several different things with it I've even inflated a tire went flat on my carit's extremely portable seems solidly built
B002UCAELQ|5|These fit perfectly in our camp trailer!  It made our curtain making project go much smoother and they work wonderfully!
B001V8U12M|5|great price, does the job so far. Another item we have several of (just in case)
B001J59VJ6|5|I did it myself, but make sure you follow the directions very closely and really make the string tight, as I now have some loose and it annoys me.
B0031743MU|5|I got this sprocket in the mail and installed on my bike ~1 hour later.  The sprocket fit perfectly and I had no issued installing it...removing the stock sprocket was a different matter.  I could not get the bolt off the stock sprocket.  I grunted and groaned and it just wouldn't budge.  I broke out the impact wrench and it zipped right off.  At 6k rpm the speed has increased from 45mph to 50mph.  I haven't noticed a difference in acceleration.  The gears are a little wider so I'm not shifting as much as before.  Take off from a stop is not too different than with the stock sprocket.  Steep hills make you downshift if you're doing under 5k rpm.  60 mph is at 7k rpm.
B00AZOJB2O|5|A+ product!!! Will recommend to other Amazoners....
B000HUQACU|4|Very good
B008DREON6|5|I ordered this organizer for my 2014 Nissan Frontier. It fit the sun visor perfectly. The side opening pockets prevent items from falling out when visor is lowered or raised.
B006MJ04E0|5|All the vinyl I received was excellent.  Great quality and easy to use for small projects.  Would definitely buy again.

B005IV13O8|5|These are stunners. These grips look amazing. BUT - I have my gripes about these grips too. Part of my issue was that in order to install these your Bar Ends must be removed. I figured as much going into the project. But my bar end bolts were bent slightly, which make taking them off a 2 day project. Left side - easy cheesy install. Right side(throttle side) - Not a great experience. Let me start by telling you these are ALUMINUM grips, you should know be told that right away. SO back to the throttle, these do come with their own throttle sleeve, however in the end I was unable to use the new one, I had to use my stock sleeve. Problem was my kill switch box would not close properly and I could not get the correct tension on the throttle.  After figuring that all out and getting the kill switch all back together, I ran into the next issue. As I have stated these are aluminum therefore they don't keep them selves in place like rubber ones do. These need to be tightened down with an allen screw and key. this is the situation I ran into - once you tighten it down to where the grip is no longer slipping over the sleeve, you can't move you throttle at all. The screw pushes against the sleeve so hard it pins your throttle in place. So you loosen the screws that hold it in place until you can move your throttle again. At some point your throttle will begin to move again but will get stuck half or wide open. Loosen a little bit more, then the grip begins to slip on the sleeve again. So you are caught in a catch 22. Tried the hairspray trick - no avail. Ultimately I ended up having to  super glue my entire sleeve and then slip on the grip. This seems to be doing the trick for now.<br /><br />So I guess what I am getting at here is that is you plan on buying these It may be in your best interest to also purchase an Aluminum Throttle Sleeve to avoid the issues I encountered. I will be getting an aluminum sleeve soon as I don't completely trust the super glue to hold forever.<br /><br />Now back to looks and feel. Like I stated before they look amazing! I have a carbon fiber theme going on with my bike right now and these are the best looking part. As far as the feel these are aluminum, so they are smooth. You will need to find the right pair of gloves to wear with these since there is really no &#34;grip&#34; to these grips. Even the space between the carbon fiber looks like it may be grippy/sticky, its not its a hard smooth coat over the aluminum. With no gloves on, on a warm day they feel just fine. You will need to let your hands get use to the feel of them, as they are a huge change from rubber grips.<br /><br />I learned a lot when installing these, but am still extremely happy with the purchase./><br />Now back to looks and feel.

B00AMELUTE|5|These are awesome. Conspicuity rules.
B0055AJ9KC|5|Just as advertised.  Easy to install and is very well built.  A tad expensive but I believe it is worth the money.
B001AY2WLU|5|LOVE THIS
B00498KQIA|4|The light was decently made, installed easily but you have to know what your doing our get a professional.  There is no step by step for the install.<br /><br />one of the mirrors I received was not fully together, I had to manually snap the pieces together.
B002G3OG6S|4|Good quality.  Would buy again.
B000TYOS3C|5|Worked just like the original.
B00LZDRCNY|2|Installation is easy. Does not make noticeable improvements on power or fuel economy
B00A3N8Y2A|5|Thought it was great!<br />Good quality for the price
B00GRVCT8W|5|Easy to apply and looks great
B0049ERM2W|5|Great
B003RAAQP4|5|Perfect...easy to program and worked immediately!
B00792IU7W|5|These work great and were easy to install.  Plus, they are cheaper than going to the dealer.  They fit our V70 R just great.
B005WKJEZ0|5|Absolutely perfect for what I needed.  Installed right on my 2013 Kia Sorento EX V6.  Simply plug and play...cannot get any easier.  The adhesive on the box was not strong enough however - so i just zip tied it to the frame.
B00HGIW4DK|4|Got here in good time nice
B001CEG90I|5|works great
B001C3B2D8|5|This helps my fiancee fasten her helmet much more easily. Sometimes it jams, so I decided to not put it on my helmet. I'm not sure it would have quite the reliability in a crash, as the strap around the original metal buckle. While there is metal to metal in this quick release unit, it has a plastic housing to keep the metal pieces engaged, so if the plastic shattered, then there's no way to keep the metal parts together. The original strap wrapped around the original buckle would have to have the helmet completely destroyed to fail.
B001O7PNNM|5|Just needed a little bit on compound, but love and trust Meguiars.
B005N53AM2|5|Sure it smells!! Like rubber which it is.  I don't really care because that will go away over time and really I think the look is great.  Added bonus is that it feels nice and on cold or hot days the fabric is easier on the hands.  Looks really good on my Toyota Taco!
B001DCL2J2|5|This fit my 2007 pontiac Torrrent perfectly and worked like when the vehicle was new. It was also easy to install.
B007Y865F0|5|Solid quality for a great price. This is the second DB Electrical product I've purchased, and both have been top notch.
B008HZK4PG|5|Great pads. Best function pads on the market. No noise period. Shipping was as stated.
B001664JOA|5|This mattress was just what we needed to replace old one , we.just put it on top of the old one and it sleeps great. Thanks
B00C1264J6|5|fits perfectly got some other amber ones they were badly designed wouldent even fit the space and even in the open this ones are brighter
B001GH1NWK|3|i liked the product but it didnt give me the substancial lift tht i needed to install larger tires as the producted stated.
B0018YGN7Q|5|Awesome!!! Can't believe how different it feels riding in the truck.  Delivery was earlier than projected.  Can't rate ease of installation because had to go to mechanic shop to get the old ones off so they put the new ones on.
B000KL6ZNK|5|My husband kept dropping hints that he wanted these floor liners. Every commercial that featured these floor liners he would mention what a great gift they would be for Christmas or our anniversary. He received them for our anniversary on December 31. He was thrilled! They fit his Dodge Ram pick up truck beautifully and several friends have ordered after seeing his.
B003VDX5D2|5|I  purchased this ladder several weeks ago and I finally installed it. I know several other people that purchased the same thing.<br />After seeing this and how it can save the knees from trying to get up into the bed I bought 1. When you start to get up in age you<br />have to compensate for all the aches and pains.<br /><br />Thank You
B001LHVOVK|3|I tried it on a 2008 Cadillac SRX with the check engine light \\"on\\" and the it didn't read the codes, the display reads \\"N/A\\" (I used a different scanner on this Cadillac and I got the codes that way; so it was not a communication issue on the car but a limitation on the MS300). I also tried it on a 2005 BMW 325 and it resets the engine light but gave me no info on the error codes. I finally I used it on a 2003 X5 with success; I got the error code info and I was able to reset the alarm. The MS300 didn't touch chassis alarms at all (like: brakes, air bags, tail lights; etc), even after I fixed the faulty components (It didn't show chassis errors and it didn't reset the alarms).
B004SNJPV0|5|Good price.
B00C0ZQ89U|5|I'd like my new hat cap Toyota, looks great on me.
B000I5B6AA|5|This is a beautifully chromed back rest. My wife and daughter both said it was very comfortable.
B005MH03RQ|4|Picks up local channels for handheld scanner in city setting. Great for volunteer fire fighters and to avoid traffic jams. Not recommended for country driving. Also good for home window mounts
B001AIZ5HY|5|I was skeptical about purchasing one of these kits and thought I would give it a try.  I can't believe how easy this system was to use.  Be sure to follow the directions and it will have your headlights looking like new in no time.  I do suggest being sure you have a 1,200 - 1,500 rpm CORDED drill.  My corded drill was less rpms than my cordless and I used a higher rpm on one light than the other which made a difference between the two.  The higher rpm headlight was like new while the lower rpm always seemed to have swirls in it, no matter how much I worked on it.
B00C7XWM90|5|My car looks new from the dealership
B000C5WBC8|5|I love it!
B007VRAK0U|5|goog
B0095GK9SI|5|Great product. Looks awesome, easy to install (need reciprocating saw). Done and cleaned up in 20 min.
B000AMBOE4|5|I was a bit skeptical. Read a ton of stuff and decided that I would try some. I have spent more money on more useless things. My car just recently hit 60,000 miles and I have used this stuff once already and just ordered another can.  Its awesome. I can always feel a difference in my car when I change the oil. Even with full synthetic I still change 3-5k miles. Oil is cheap engines are not, neither are mechanics.  So in 60k miles on a 2007 Mitsubishi Galant what problems have I had? Zero. After 55,000 I put this in my car...It felt stringer then ever. As I said before I can always notice an increase in response, power, and fuel eco after an oil change. This stuff just made it that much better.  I am sold. Even if it is a placebo(which I don't think it is. Its a cheap high. I will be using this EVERY oil change from here on out. Expect more reviews from me.<br /><br />Tips: Heat the can up EVER so slightly so it pours easier. When you start the oil change set it on the engine or in some hot water. will make it flow easier as you want ALL of this in your engine.
B00KIF2UUK|5|The grills worked perfectly. Thanks
B005IIR7EG|5|GREAT
B000CAYSF6|5|Very happy with the price, delivery time and quality. OB
B0018R9RJO|5|I bought this fuel pump for my '96 Miata to solve a fuel delivery problem. I was pleased to find it to be a perfect replacement, identical to the original. It is quiet and solved my problem. I am glad i didn't go with a cheaper alternate and would have had to make modifications to get it installed. Note that, after i received the pump, I read that the warranty would not be honored unless a new strainer was installed with the pump. So, I ordered one for about $15 from Amazon. That made the replacement even easier as i didn't have to remove the old one. Be sure and wear nitrile gloves as you will get fuel on your hands!
B001GF7KR4|5|Love the Windshield Sunshade.  Tried other brands to no avail, but this one really works & I recommend it highly!!
B00W31VMYC|5|Excellent... working great.
B004A2D4V6|5|Perfect AC now!
B006RY0K12|2|When I tried to reapply the door handle (it was a little off), the plastic broke off.  The 3M adhesive was much stronger than the plastic door handle.
B00MEI16MC|5|Just as described. Fits my car seat perfectly!
B002FHF7E0|4|as advertised. Works well.
B000AMSC4E|5|I drive a 2003 Jeep Liberty and love everything about it except how difficult it is to find the 11\\" wiper for the back window.  In fact, since buying the Jeep new off the lot in the winter of 2002, the back wiper had been replaced only once, in 2006, because the wipers were so difficult to find locally.  While the old wiper did okay for so long, over time, it started to wear out and the last two inches of the already tiny 11\\" blade wouldn't wipe every pass.  So after striking out at Auto Zone and Napa this spring, I turned to Amazon, and found the elusive 11\\" rear wiper blades and stocked up.  It'll be nice to know when the blade starts getting old and lazy, I won't have to trek to a dealership to track down replacement blades.  I might be able to change it once or twice a year now!<br /><br />On the Jeep's rear window, as long as the wiper isn't on its last legs, this wiper blade does clean a swath with its entire length.  Every once in a while I squirt some WD-40 into the joints of the wiper arm, and that seems to help a lot, keeping the blade working better longer.<br /><br />I'm very happy with this Bosch wiper blade and its performance, and the price here on Amazon is quite good, considering there was no chasing from store to store to dealership in order to get a simple wiper blade.  Couldn't ask for more!
B006ICSU1A|5|Great for an emergency tire pressure gauge. I've been wanting one for my keychain for a while now. Very happy with the order and it shipped FAST. I received it almost overnight! ;)
B000JFJMFK|5|This fill adapter is pretty much your only option to fill these trannies, but it works very well! With this adapter, either use a suction gun with a hose on it, or you can find a short piece of 5/8\\" hose to clamp over the end if you have bulk tranny fluid coming out of a reel.
B00G190DTC|4|They were good worked but didn't fit my car. Very bright
B0041I0Y1M|5|Second easiest install on my bike so far (windshield was first). All the parts came and worked PERFECTLY for my VTX 1300. Comes with lighter too but I use it to power my GPS and phone charger. Would recommend!
B000BQW5LK|4|I used it to pump oil into my differential and transmission. It worked very well. It saved me a lot of trouble. However, I counted considerably more than 250 pumps per liter so each pump is less than 4cc, at least for the one I got.
B00I4E91GI|5|hope good,
B008BMQYGI|5|Wife loved it!
B003LITBJY|4|Item is all of what the description stated. Please know it was made in Taiwan and not all is polished out as it should be. Spent a hour or so completing this task before mounting it.
B00B8EUHMS|5|My 2013 Civic LX looks really cool and sporty with this wing. It really brings out the sporty look in it. If you are handy with power tools and have installed this type of items in previous vehicles go for it and install it yourself, otherwise; seek profession installlation from a local tunner shop that specializes on these things the last thing you want is driving around with a crooked spoiler wing or jacked holes on the trunk lid. Trust me this is the cheapest you will find this wing everywhere else I looked they wanted anywhere above two hundred dollars. And the color make sure you get the right code the paint is perfectly matched I am extremely satisfied with this product other than the installation instructions. They really are for people with manual skills in these things.
B006RYZL02|5|Im from NY and this Item is great for my black car. Amazing.  Just amazing!
B000WJ87PY|4|I like it but the cute colorful parts get dirty very easily.
B0087PJAXI|3|Had to add hose clamps to the bulb  leaks gas and air into the line. Cheap and works after I added hose clamps
B005JU5UEW|5|Good product already and I see it's the best of the parent company
B000BZJ7DU|5|Perfect fit, Improved gas mileage and got rid of the nasty P420 code. I would recommend this product to anyone
B003HOWSYC|3|Little challenge in application. Delicate . . . but it looks good.
B0093XLGVM|2|They aren't that bright.
B000JZA6V4|2|These are the stock spark plugs used in many cars, but my story is one from a 70,000 mile 1996 Monte Carlo....    When I bought my car new one of the ways the dealer sold me on it was that it would not need a tune-up for 100,000 miles.  So I agreed on the purchase and was really happy until last year...    I began to get random misfires (not setting codes) and a noticible drop in fuel economy...    I took it in, they performed a fuel system cleaning and said for sure that was the cause.  It didn't turn out to be, but it set me back moneywise so much that I couldn't do anything more with the dealer...    Finally I read that these plugs have platinum pads on both sides and that the stock GM ignition system is so powerful that it eats them up fast.  So I dug in and checked and voila!  Cylinder number 3 and 4 plugs had blown the pads off!  The gap was .075 or more...    Can't say I'll be using these plugs again.  It's a pita to change on the 3100 engine IMO, so I'll try something else.    Sad that manufacturers lie about thier build quality...its ends up being a lot of money our of pocket for the consumer in the end.  Not to mention a big headache.
B000TYEDFK|4|got these at a local kawi shop good bars,<br />for klx250sf had to cut 2inches off the ends<br />re-route the upper throttle cable for more slack.<br />drill hole for control dowels to keep them in place.<br />braaaaap
B00VKQ6ECQ|5|Worked perfectly.
B00AIJY2ZM|5|These gave my vehicles look great!!! These interior lights work excellent!!! Some what expensive at $10.00 dollars a pice, but it was all worth it!!!

B002BQJC0K|5|I love these gloves bc they are comfortable, flexible, and keep my hands warm on the coldest days.  The material is good quality and it is perfect for riding.
B000CMH41E|5|Good product
B000BR1QCI|5|Designed perfectly, this air intake fit well and needed only the modifications in the instruction manual. I am very happy.
B00317FPPE|4|Theyre smaller than they look and I didnt see any real dimensions but I figured the threaded end would be about the same size as stock. Its actually much smaller than the stock ones so it fits very loosely in the hole and therefore the rest of it is smaller than I envisioned. The overall body once its mounted sticks out 2.5&#34; and the lens is about 1 5/8&#34; x 3/4&#34;. I fitted a rubber grommet in each hole on the bike and used lock nuts to hold them on somewhat loosely so if it gets banged into something it wont just snap off.<br /><br />The quality is decent. Theyre made of metal but it is a soft metal, still better than cheap plastic. The lenses are just glued on and one popped off one while I was installing it so I had to stick it back on with silicone.<br /><br />Overall I'm happy with these lights but I do wish they were a little larger. Dont forget an electronic flasher unit or LEDs wont flash correctly.
B001F5I614|5|Everything I got from you was great, all my stickers, and I love my floor mats. And can't wait for different NY GIANT'S items to come in. Thank you for all your awesome items. I will buy more soon : )

B002GT78GW|5|I ordered this decal and was surprised that it was suck a heavy duty vinyl decal.  It stuck - and stuck WELL!  So measure, measure and measure again before sticking it on anything - did I mention measure?  Great sticker/decal.  I've already run it through the carwash and a do-it-yourself carwash with a close range pressure washer nozzle.  Still on and held up remarkably!  Get it if you like it!  :)
B00858LFOY|1|Great wire for my use. Shipped extremely fast. Would have gave it 5 stars but cable was a foot short. Ordered 25 ft but was shipped 24 ft. Thankfully I only need 20ft.
B008EXHNZA|1|Looked very cheap and generic. It may work for you but not my 50CC like I have. Good luck if you get it
B000BWE3UU|5|Good quality accurate description
B005IV15QE|5|This thing is a beast! We use them at work and I wanted one for my personal garage. Can't get more heavy duty than this for the price. These things last forever, if taken care of properly. Definitely would buy again.
B000G6M3VC|5|After 2 years and occasional use, these work just fine for measuring air pressure.  I keep them in the center console of my cars.
B00CQAR1OK|5|Fit perfectly and instructions good
B00B93MJ3S|3|These hinges are better than the stock ones I had.  However I was a little disappointed in the finish.  As with everything made in China, corners were cut.  The prep was done hastily, therefore you can see sandscratches under the powdercoat, and it looks like they were done by hand too...aside from that, they are decent.  But $200 for hinges is a little steep so I would have expected a better finish.  Hopefully they last longer than the stock ones did...
B00CZCY5SE|4|works well
B001CF5EF8|5|You can't beat the strength and fitment of this bumper for the price. I've had mine for a year now and love it paired with the [[ASIN:B001CF5ED0 Smittybilt 76651D SRC Classic Rear Bumper with D-Ring and Textured Black Tire Carrier]]. Installation was really easy, it was more trouble to get the stocker off than to install this one and it's twice as stout.
B00L3P75SQ|5|Good
B000KKD2YQ|3|The rollers and bushings are high quality and deserve 5 stars, but unfortunately the hog clips are a mixed bag.  I ordered 2 kits on 7/22/14 and the included hog rings (4 per package) were &#34;C&#34; shaped and flimsy.  I didn't trust they would hold, so I reused my heavier (but slightly rusty) rings which were already on my Sea Lion trailer.  1 week later I ordered 3 more kits and was surprised to find heavy-duty &#34;W&#34; shaped rings inside the package.  I'd gladly bump this review to 5 stars if Amazon would send me 2 sets of the newer &#34;W&#34; rings.<br /><br />Also, why only 1 washer and 1 ring per roller?  The rollers on my trailer have a ring and washer on each side, so 2 per would make more sense.

B00480FIEG|4|The light produced is very white and the bulbs do produce much more light than the 'OEM' original equipment Philips bulbs my car came with... and these new bulbs do not have a hint of the OE yellowish tint.     The bulbs in my opinion don't approach a bluish hue but are straight bright white.  This may be due in part to the reflectors in my lens that hide the headlight bulb from eyesight including the blue painted tip.    I have Pilot brand white LED bulbs in the corner marker lamps next to my headlights which are even whiter and closer to a bluish tint and much closer to HID color.  I was hoping these CrystalVision headlight bulbs would match in color to the LED corner bulbs.  There is a much better match with these new headlight bulbs than the normal yellowish OE bulbs.    A true HID matching bulb would have a slight hint of blue and even more toward a light purplish color, at least from certain angles as true HID headlights look as you approach and pass them.     Overall I'm very satisfied with the greater brightness of light emitted and the color of the light which is a huge improvement over the yellowish OE bulbs. I have tried and seen other bulbs that do have a blue tint or a bluer tint than these bulbs, but you're usually trading down by huge margins in quality and at a steep price, (usually $40-50 or more) only to have the bulbs fail in months or within the 1st year.  And that fact has been one of my primary reasons for choosing the Philips brand, as it was the OE brand that came with my car and lasted.    The bigger question for these and any 'upgrade' bulbs is how long they will last (they tend to burn hotter).   My OE Philips standard bulbs lasted 14 years.  A pair of 'Crystal Blue' (brand?) bulbs lasted 3 months in my car.  A pair of Sylvania 'Cool Blue' bulbs only lasted 6 months in my car. (Produced a slight blue tint)  A Pair of Sylvania 'SilverStar' lasted 1 year in my car. (Produced a similar color as these Philips bulbs)    (Note: The Sylvania bulbpackaging only rates the SilverStar with 1 out of 4 marks for bulb life. I believe the 'Cool Blue' have either a 1 or 2 out of 4 life rating and the OE bulb have a 3 out of 4 rating I believe. I'm expecting the same bulb life as the SilverStar for the Philips bulb though I'm hoping it will end up being much better considering I got 14 years out of my OE Philips bulbs.)     I posed this question about the CrystalVision Ultra 'upgrade' bulbs in an email to Philips but their response was a little confusing (as I'm sure they wanted to be a little vague).  I couldn't tell if they were saying the bulbs would last 1-2 years depending on amount of use varying from customer to customer or if they were saying that the life of the bulbs could vary up to 1-2 years from customer to customer depending on the differing amount of use of each.   What I do know is that I have had poor experience's with generic aftermarket brand bulbs and with Sylvania's automotive and household bulbs and won't consider that brand again.  What more I know from research is that 'upgrade' bulbs that produce a whiter (or other color), brighter light don't come close to lasting as long as OE bulbs.  I also looked at purchasing some PIAA 'Super Plasma' bulbs but read multiple poor reviews stating a slight yellowish tint as well as the same critique of the Hella's whiter bulbs.    The Philips bulbs are made in Germany (I would consider this a positive point as far as quality goes and what I attribute the length of life of my OE Philips bulbs too).     I paid $27.72 for the Philips CrystalVision Ultra bulbs with free Super Saver shipping and have seen the same bulbs in stores from a regular price of $29.99 down to a clearance price of $23.99.  Compared this to Sylvania's SilverStar brands ranging from $39.99 - 49.99(Ultra) and Hella's at $49.99.    I don't think you can go wrong with the Philips in quality, color of light and especially price in direct comparison with the other brands.  The other brands would have to show remarkably better performance for them to justify their inflated price over the Philips... and in my experience with multiple brands and research of brighter, whiter, 'closer to HID' 'upgrade' bulbs, a superior performance doesn't exist in those brands from anything I've come across.
B003D5A77K|5|these are some great lights and worth every dime you cant go wrong. im glad i got these and im sure you will be as well
B00NWF9AVU|5|Very happy with the fob!
B00AOLGSDS|1|DO NOT BUY FROM JET. I bought this for my 2011 Charger R/T. Installation was very difficult. The PCM is mounted in an area with very little extra space. After installing the Jet module, the PCM had NO extra room and had to be wedged between the fender well and the interior air filter box. After installation the car ran terribly. It missed a lot and almost died several times after I put the pedal to the metal. If fact, it did die once when I was sitting at a stop light.<br /><br />To top it all off, Jet will not let you return a chip after it has been installed. When you receive it, you have 72 hours to install it. After 72 hours, they won't even let you return it to have it checked out. I have a faulty unit, and because I waited until the weekend to install it, I cannot even see if they can repair it.<br /><br />I should have just taken the money and put a match to it.
B000F5DQWY|5|Installed on my Suzuki S40. Followed the wiring and used the relay, as instructed. It's not completely plug and play on a motorcycle. I did purchase some wire and some electrical connectors in an auto supply store. A nice project for half an afternoon. Used the mounting bracket from original  horn. Will buy another for my scooter. It's a good way to keep yourself noticed on a motorcycle.  Follow-up. The horn has worked well for over a year. Checked the wiring and mounting from time to time to keep it tight and well connected.
B0007LZXFO|4|Made in Taiwan, I assumed U.S. after reading all the U.S. manufacturing hype on their web site. Bad assumption on my part.
B004HE3WAU|5|Needed new pad's for the new rotors, went to Rock Auto first, with 2 sets of shipping charges, My best option was on Amazon. Fast shipping and no extra charge....Only been on the car for a few days, but I see no problems in the future.
B0052XNNJK|5|easy to install - fits perfectly
B00AO0E5QQ|4|Been needing these as I have been doing it the wrong way using screwdrivers and scratching surfaces. These make things easier. Needed to remove door panels on a new car without messing anything up.
B00H1ES6S6|5|Very bright and low cost.
B005T44B98|4|Very easy installation and an over all fit of about a 9.  Just be real careful with the VW Jack when lifting the car.  I did the work on a concrete<br />floor and the jack slipped out from under and dented the rocker panel.  Changed to a hydraulic floor jack to complete the job.VW Jack = piece of Junk.
B000YC42RQ|1|This kit does not contain 1/4\\" tubing by normal standards.  It is 1/4\\" OUTSIDE diameter...this means nothing.  Normally, tubing and pipe sizes are listed as INSIDE diameter as this is really what determines the volume of flow (but not the pressure capacity.)
B001N72FES|5|This Side Post Battery Master Disconnect Switch is great and works exactly as described. That said, my application was for use on a lawn tractor with the standard smaller 12V battery used on most lawn tractors, so the fit was slightly different than on a standard side post battery.  However, by using the same bolt used with the negative battery post, as well as the bolt supplied with the disconnect, the device easily mounted against the flat, negative post on top of the battery.  With a simple twist of the knob, the battery is disconnected and ready for storage. Also, while mowing, the disconnect knob seems to easily resist loosening during the vibrations produced during operation. Very solid and dependable. Very pleased. Highly recommended.
B00LFNLH58|5|Perfect replacement fit! thank you -
B004A0UAII|5|So easy to install. Why did I ever pay anyone to do this?
B00383SFBW|5|Excellent fit and finish, installs in less than 5 mins. This is my 2nd. cover, I installed 1st. one one my '08 Silverado over 3 years ago and it still looks great, I installed one one my '11 because of this.
B00J2G7UJC|5|perfect
B00EKPOG10|5|I've used these in different colors all over my pickup and I love them...Thier awsome and seem to last...they have for me anyway and I will continue buying and using them and also recommend them.
B000JL760W|5|Exactly as I ordered it.  Would have been nice if it came in a kit with the test strips.  Coolant, Prep, and test strips all together.
B004BCLBJM|5|Great lights much better than standard
B00BCLA5OM|5|Looks great on my car
B00DYJ8LKA|5|Excellent
B004DJCS2M|1|Any one trying to bring back a dead battery, I would suggest replacing the acid with fresh acid and buy a good charger/desulfator. This stuff made my battery worse.
B008K4BM1O|4|The product is excellent quality however it needs a little tweaking to work properly (2007 Chevy tahoe model) The remote casing  is almost an exact copy of the original however the battery will not make conact with the circuit board.  Apparently the housing is slightly larger than the factory model so the battery does not make contact with the circuit board.  To fix the issue simply scape the flange off of both sides of the battery holder (2 semi-circles on the bottom half of remote).  Next place 5 layers of electrical tape in the battery mount on the lower half of the remote.  I simply stacked 5 layers of electrcial tape on top of each other and then trimmed them with a scissors to be the size of the battery.  Stick this on the lower half, insert the battery, snap the two halves together and viola your remote will work.  Well worth the time considering the amount of money saved.
B002LBKG5K|5|I was a bit skeptical about buying a after-market liner, but after fitting it into my car, I can highly recommend this product to other car owners.  The liners fit well into the flooring and thanks to spikes on the bottom, they do not shift as your all of your friends try to damage your newly purchased liner.  Speaking of which, they are very durable and I don't think I'll ever need to buy a replacement for it.<br /><br />Just a note: be sure that they fit your car's make/model and that you get your desired color.
B002H8U3KK|5|this was the best price I found,  Very fast delivery and the item arrived intacked this is the only fluid you can use on gm t-case with push button 4wd
B0041P1SLU|4|The parts were exactly as ordered even though my husband didn't think so.  When I contacted Onestopshops, they were very helpful and concerned.  Matter was settled with ease.  All the parts were there.
B000J41VDM|1|I bought this because my dvds are scratched up, and skipping or just plain froze. I read the reviews and soe said it worked. I have come to the conclusion that this dosent work for cds, dvd that have deep scratches. tons of those little scratches! So this didnt work for me a all.
B00BKTQCKM|2|Not even close to a lookalike of the original badge. This badge rather longer than a real one, the blue color is off, and the text isn't crisp.<br /><br />I don't know how well it sticks, because there's no way I'm putting this on my car.<br /><br />I knew it wasn't going to be genuine, but I'm extremely disappointed in it.
B00P9RAOIW|1|Deceptive advertisement . You do not get the actual spout shown in the pictures , only the adapters which are useless without spout.
B000CPCOBQ|5|I love these speed bleeders! Makes it super fast to bleed the brakes! I had got all new wheel cylinders and put these on first thing.
B0010GG7YG|5|Works perfectly just like I expected.
B00CBDIJ98|4|Greatly minimizes those hammers from past decades.  Clips to the sun visor and is out of sight and mind until you need it.
B0082CTSOM|5|I bought this product and it didn't fit my car,  oh well no big lost.
B00ENLSRRK|4|I love the grill
B001F0G8DC|5|OEM fit and finish. Good quality.  Gloss black front is nice, but was too glossy for me (nothing wrong with it). Masked it off, scuffed it up, and shot it with satin black enamel to match my color scheme.
B00DK2EGDC|4|Hard to beat WoodWick products; I thought the smell of this one was more fruity than woodsy; my favorite is Evening Bonfire or Fireside; they don't last long though, after a month the smell fades.
B00CDW2MCM|4|Fast and quiet.  Just be sure you don't accidentally plug it into a 10amp port instead of a 15amp port.  My Subaru has one of each, and it blew the 10amp fuse pretty quickly.  My own fault, really since the manual specifies a 15amp port, and I didn't bother to check mine until AFTER the fuse blew.  Running on the 15amp port, it's the fastest quietest 12v compressor I've used, and I've had two others.  If it lasts at least as long as the last one of a different brand (5 years or so, using about once a month), it'll be worth the reasonable price of around $40 I paid for it.
B0028JLO3I|4|This mirror does everything it suppose to by showing a larger scope behind you but be sure to have sunglasses with you as you will not be able to use your visors with this mirror.
B0027HX0VA|4|The bar looks and feels good on the Jeep.  The installation was easy and its a 3 piece design.  I'm using the bar to carry a kayak on my Jeep since i have a soft top, and the bar works great for that.  If your using the bar as an actual light bar something to consider and i'm not sure if you would or wouldn't experience this with other bars, but installing it as a light bar will block you from opening your soft top.  The light brackets stick out from the bar and it will hit the sun rider top if you try to open it.  I'm not sure if you would be able to open the top if you had a hardtop.  Since i'm not putting lights on the bar, i spun the bar backwards so the light brackets faced toward the front of the Jeep and got around the problem.  I used the light brackets and the hole designs on the side of the bar as tie downs for the kayak.  Overall for the price, i'm glad i purchased it.  I read the other review and was concerned about the wind.  I did get the wind noise and some soft top flapping, but I've never had any other light bars to compare it to.  Once i put the kayak on the flapping went away.
B0002F68FO|5|Didn't take 5 minutes to install and is very sturdy once attached to my trailer. Very easy to fold in either direction and comes fully assembled. Appears to be a quality product that has met my expectations.
B00BMPFI6I|5|Perfect Jack. Easy to operate. Speedy delivery. Good price.
B000GU1NAA|5|It fits & works great. Lots better then the stock one. Just wish it came in Renegade Black to match the one on the front of my bike.
B00J52R390|3|pricey for what you get, i guess when you are the only manufacture, you can charge what you want
B0007TFL6W|5|Just as good as everyone says. The fit is good but not as tight as laser measurement might suggest to you. The mats are thinner and more flexible than I had expected but still very effective. They look better than the picture shows in my black 2014 Mustang GT. I also bought the Weathertech cleaner and protectant as they are not silicon based as most aftermarket products. This is important if you don't want slippery mats. A great buy.
B001AMYO0E|1|In one word, I should have returned this. Of course I did not pay attention to the dimesions of this thing so that was my own fault, but for the money you would think it would be of better quality. The leather if is was leather, is very thin. I had it in use for 3 months and destroyed it, in simple use. So, the product is crap.
B009VZ5VC2|1|They wipe clean but they're very difficult to attach to my car -  very hard to figure out. And now the retaining clip has loosened, meaning I have to clip it back down every time I get out of the caar.
B006U98V10|3|I bought this running board for my wife 2011 ML350.  Got the running boards on time.  But there are several problem with this running board.<br />1-It did not come with any instruction what so ever, just the bolts kit and pair of running boards.  If you don't have experience in this.  You will never able to remove the old one and put the new one one at all.  Thank GOD I am a retire mechanic by trade and still have all my tools otherwise my wife would kill me.  She insist to go to the dealer and have them install one for her.<br />2- it does not fit flush with the rear fender no matter what I try<br />3- It come in with couple broken plastic nut on the running board.  I have to drill the hole bigger to make it fit correctly so the plastic nut wont broke again.<br />It look good from 10' way but come close to it.  You will see the fit and finish is not nice.  But for $300 you can beat it.
B000CITK8S|5|I bought this mainly for a 2006 mini cooper that we seldom drive (10,200 miles). The battery was always low/dead and required jumping. Even though this is still the original battery, I had it tested and was told that if I put on a trickle charger/maintainer it may last another year or so. The BT jr. came with gator clips or  terminals to be directly attached to the battery post and left in place. you simply disconnect it from the charger/maintainer. I was skeptical at first but the BT jr had so many good  reviews with less than 1% negative I thought I would give it a try. The car had not been driven for several months and though it started you could tell the battery was low. I plugged in the charger and it took a day and a half to go green indicating a full charge. It did get pretty warm during that time but now that it is in maintain mode it is just slightly warm to the touch. Seems to be a decent unit for the price and very compact. It plugs directly into a wall socket. This is not a quick charger by any means.
B004TRKBOK|4|put one of these in my glovebox.<br /><br />hope i never have to use it.
B00029XGIM|5|I bought two of these, one low, and one high, to replace my single OEM horn.  They were wired in parallel, and they work just fine.  They are much louder than the pathetic, single horn that came from the factory.  They really let people in cars/trucks know that I am there.  Highly recommended upgrade for any motorcycle!  Cheers!
B00L43XVJE|4|I do like it. It's an average plastic license plate frame, but is made nicer by the BMW logo.
B00CCE8K36|5|Great fit for my can-am spyder St
B004OU99UE|4|I was replacing my dead 1500w modified sine Inverter that I used for 13 years at my cabin. I wanted to upgrade to pure sine but I was chocking on the cost. I found this Inverter is priced very reasonable. Its made by a very well known manufacture, on this side of the pond (Canada). Has a in your face remote display so you don't get a crick in your neck trying to read the thing. Has a snooze mode so it draws very little power yet stills lets small wattage devices work, like lights and TV while still in snooze mode. Has the latest greatest high frequency dual transformer, 2011 design stuff inside which makes it smaller and lighter than other Inverters. It has enough safety features to protect it from its owner like low volt alarm and shutdown and GFI plugs. But the main reason I choose this Inverter was the fact this was the only inverter I found with a TWO year warranty and I think that says a lot about the manufacturer and their product.
B00BITICAC|5|I am not sure if this is original Toyota part or not but it is excellent.
B0000AY3X0|5|If you haven't tried product yet, you've been drying your car the hard way. I've never seen a material that dries anything so well. I will never buy anything other than this. Take care of it and it lasts forever.
B00HQGCRBG|1|Bought both these Struts and installed. Passenger side started making lots of noise in turns and steadily got worse. Driver then started making noise. Took wheel off and disconneced tierod and strut was in a bind as if the top bearing was failing. Eighter they assembled wrong at factory or the top bearings are shot. Replaced with Gabriel Struts and are ok npw. Wated my money on these by trying to go cheap
B00A4NCB5K|5|Made my boat look brand new in 10 mins
B004X5QPY8|1|Radiator lasted less than a year and less than 15,000 miles.  No visible damage, just sprung a leak.  Not worth the time or effort.<br /><br />Despite being junk, it fit well and looked like it belonged before it broke.
B001GJ3EJS|5|as described
B006OUNFIO|5|good price
B004EIDD2Q|5|I now have three of these.  Rarely use them for jump starting cars, but have them on hand for power failures. With these I am able to charge my cell phones, play a battery powered TV, battery powered DVD player and a battery powered radio.  We live in a area prone to hurricanes and often lose power.  These are quality items and very useful.
B00539KWPQ|1|The mats look perfect, but the rubber smell is so intense.  I left them outside for a week to air out, didn't work.  I can't use them,<br />they are sitting in my garage.
B001MYWBF0|5|replaced an outdated and nonworking - like the battery % and display options
B000VW2HVM|5|good!
B0031I807I|5|These fit my old 2004 Saturn Ion RIP from hail storm.
B0089KNGNQ|5|Worked great with instructions for programming taken from the internet called &#34;chicken dance&#34;
B00BYH6C1E|2|It would work great if one did not have to re-adjust the driver seat!  As when we do it makes a rubbing noise, and I would think over time, scuff up the center console.  For this piece of equipment to work properly on the CRV, one has to really push it down a ways, as the center console is lower than the seats!  It would work better in vehicles where the center console is higher than thew seats!  And it does NOT work in my Mitsubishi L200 truck as the front seats extend over the center console.<br /><br />The product itself is finely made, maybe just not ideal for all vehicles.  My wife really wants to take it out of the CRV--as it may scuff up the console and does make an annoying sound when it is rubbing, when re-adjusting the seat!<br /><br />I can see it being effective in many vehicles, just not in ours!  And we are huge fans of Shark Tank, so I really wanted to like this product--but just can't, sorry Mr Wonderful--You are dead to me!!  And yes I know it was Lori G that made the deal with them,lol
B001OMKH7Y|5|Exact same switch as on my Harley,works great!
B00859YNTM|4|I started my VW without the air bag placard plugged in, which caused an air bag fault. This device cleared it. I'm happy. It does feel cheap but so what. It's not like I'm using it everyday.
B001LRASDU|3|I've owned this rack for a few years now, in addition to other surf racks for my other cars and this one is my least favorite.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. Securely holds one longboard (mine is 9') with two fabric straps.<br />2. Pretty easy to install with the OEM honda crossbars (will not work with any other brand). Took around 10 minutes.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. Straps are so short that you can only hold one longboard. When I try to carry two longboards, I need to use my own straps.<br />I would recommend the Shockles ShockStrap [...]<br /><br />2. The rack attachment is a \\"cradle\\" so must be readjusted for the width of any new board that you put on it. As is, I need to adjust if for when I bring my shortboard or funboard instead of my longboard. This is time consuming and needs tools.<br /><br />3. You need to buy another set if you want to carry two boards side by side.<br /><br />4. There is no padding on the straps which could dent your board if you cinch it tight.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />Decent rack if you only carry one longboard or two shortboards.<br /><br />I would recommend you skip this rack and buy a few rack pads for the honda crossbars and get some aftermarket straps to tie down your boards. That way you have the flexibility to carry more boards of any size you want.
B0013LH6RU|5|Great bag for the nagger guys. Make a great backrest. Comes off easy when your done, but not too easy that someone will help themselves. Allows you to put a smaller bag on your luggage rack and helps in keeping the center of gravity where it needs to be for those long trips. It is a big open bag, so organize when you pack.
B000M8R0QM|1|I purchased this hopping to get a product somewhat better than the usual lightweight, plastic cased compressors.<br />This is used on standard SUV and bicycle tires.  After approx. one year, this product fails to do the job.<br />While inflating vehicle tires, the hose gets hotter than a radiator hose (if rubber could glow red hot, it would); the unit struggles and barely fills the tires.  The only thing it will fill is a bicycle tire now.  Next time I will pony up the extra money and buy a product that looks like this but really works.  I wasted my money on this.
B001RV78F6|5|Very happy with product
B003D3YKO8|2|This bracket was advertised as the correct one for the Camco 59005 RV Propane Double-Stage Auto-Changeover Regulator but the holes for mounting the regulator do not line up.  Only one out of four holes can be used.  Now I will need to drill more holes in order to use this bracket.  I will probably drill holes in the old bracket I have and use it instead because this bracket is very large and bulky. I would not recommend it.
B000C5UFK8|5|This appears to be genuine OEM product and was an easy and direct replacement for my stock O2 sensor.  Looks identical to the original and cured my P133 fault code.  Installation was simple.  Refer to http://www.4x4wire.com/toyota/4Runner/tech/O2_Sensor/ for installation guidance.
B00D1ASSY6|5|These lights performed better than I expected they were bright and red . I was pleased with everything about them.
B00EER3FVG|5|Great value.  Needs work, however, to make this light marine ready.<br /><br />When you get these lights, the first thing you should do is seal them.  I seriously doubt the water proof rating in factory condition.  Add some marine sealant to the port where the power plug goes into the casing and seal around the lens.  No big deal, takes under 5 minutes for each lamp.  I also painted the bracket white, so it will look better.  Other than that, installation is pretty straightforward.  Brings all the hardware you need.<br /><br />At this price, you will not find a better deal.  I would order these again in a heartbeat, even though they do require some work to make them marine ready.
B009KP77WU|1|Easy to install, but it is a POS! Worked great for about 200 miles of my 550 mile trip. It shorted out my Patriot's taillights so I hat to unhook it on the side of the road and continue my trip with no trailer lights. Called and emailed Curt a few times, still waiting for them to contact me back!!
B00K6CRIVQ|5|Good switch
B001VB8V7G|5|[[VIDEOID:mo2XK02HIXEA5MG]]The Bully Alarm Pager Lock is a great device for Motorcycles and Bicycles where it's virtually impossible to mount and use any typical (automobile like) alarm system. Being self contained and having the pager function is just superb, and the price is nice too. I haven't had a motorcycle in years, but I have become an avid Mountain Biker. I have three tricked out mtn. bikes that I have put a lot of time into upgrading with parts and accessories. I live in Montana and have to drive about 5-15 miles with my bikes on my Swagman Dual Bike Rack: [[ASIN:B0001VO1YY Swagman XC Cross-Country 2-Bike Hitch Mount Rack (1/1/4 and 2-Inch Receiver)]]. The roads from my home to the trail heads are absolutely NOT \\"bike friendly\\"!, but there are some bike friendly bike lanes in and around town and the MSU campus.<br /><br />The \\"Bully\\" is the perfect solution for both my 2 Trail Mountain Bikes and my one In Town Commuting Mountain Bike. It's common knowledge that many U-Locks can be defeated with a simple \\"Scissor Jack\\", so the Bully's pager/paging function is just essential. Now with the Bully with me I can ride my commuter rig to the gym, stores, etc. without worry. In addition, After a day of trail riding with a friend or date, we can stop at a restaurant after a hard day of riding and not have to worry about the bikes as they are secured to my Swagman hitch bike rack with the Bully and I have the pager with me!<br /><br />The Pagers range is very good, and I have not had any signal reception problems. The Bully product info says it's water resistant, but it really virtually water proof. Importantly, THE BULLY U-LOCK USES A STANDARD 9v BATTERY AND THE PAGER USES A STANDARD \\"AAA\\" BATTERY! I put Lithium batteries in both! No messing with silly oddball watch batteries!<br /><br />Using the Bully lock and pager is a little confusing at first, so read the manual carefully. You'll soon figure out that One Beep means the Bully is armed, and One Beep on the pager means it's on and active. Two beeps on the Bully lock and on the pager means they are Unarmed and Off respectively. Amazon (and Motorcycle Superstore) were both great; the Bully was well packaged and arrived quickly to Bozeman, MT.<br /><br />I had been looking at $100 Heavy Duty Chain Locks: [[ASIN:B001N888OS Kryptonite New York 1217 Bicycle Chain Lock and Evolution Series 4 Disc Lock (5-Foot x 5-Inch)]] or [[ASIN:B004R9KSWA Kryptonite New York Fahgettaboudit Chain with Disc Lock - 5 Ft./--]], but man am I glad I found the Bully. It's such a superior security solution at the same price!!!means it's on and active. Two beeps on the Bully lock and on the pager means they are Unarmed and Off respectively. Amazon (and Motorcycle Superstore) were both great; the Bully was well packaged and arrived quickly to Bozeman, MT.<br /><br />I had been looking at $100 Heavy Duty Chain Locks: [[ASIN:B001N888OS Kryptonite New York 1217 Bicycle Chain Lock and Evolution Series 4 Disc Lock (5-Foot x 5-Inch)]] or [[ASIN:B004R9KSWA Kryptonite New York Fahgettaboudit Chain with Disc Lock - 5 Ft./--]], but man am I glad I found the Bully. It's such a superior security solution at the same price!!!
B0002NILMY|5|So excited always looking for John Deere stuff and at a great price and this cover is made really well and paid less then half from other places
B001AIZ5HY|4|It Worked....
B000CMHT64|5|great item and even a better price.
B000EDOT8C|5|Perfect fit.  Just right to give me an extra 20 or so inches of counter space in the galley.  Looks nice!  and the flexible cutting board protector is a nice touch.
B00KWJ5VRG|4|Item arrived quickly and was as advertised.  The instructions on how to obtain programming directions were poor and didn't not ultimately tell me how to program my new remote...so thank you to other purchasers who commented and provided the direction the seller should have clearly identified.
B00HX8ZNN6|4|They look very nice.True to pictures
B0083W1A9W|5|Factory fit !!!  No adjustment needed
B006T0M706|5|as ordered, perfect fit, new as advertised, met our expectitations, why do you need so many words for this to take a review?
B003V57NUQ|3|The products pretty nice overall. It did have a little rust inside the tubes and they do seem like the fit and finish could be a little bit better. However, they work and I think they are a good buy for the money and occasional use.
B0002SR7TC|4|Does what it says on the tin - evacuates and dispenses fluid. Did an easy, no-mess oil change on my car without having to jack it up - perfect.
B00280BL9O|5|It works just like you think it would. Body is medal and well built.
B000XQ9MGE|4|Great holiday gift
B009WUIJLQ|5|Easy application, fit perfectly!
B00AF1ESG6|5|Super Bright have on me my Honda Pioneer and it's like turning on the sun!
B00332GPQU|5|Bought these for my husband's Toyota Tundra. He had gotten me some for my car last year and was procrastinating on buying some for himself due to the retail price. I saved a few bucks on Amazon over local auto stores and he loves them. As a smoker he likes to have the window's cracked in all kinds of weather and these work well to keep rain/snow out and let fresh air in.
B0009Y2CFS|5|My 1997 Ford Aerostar lost it's heater many years ago and I toughed out 4 Chicago winters with no heat.  A friend guided me to this blanket and I am amazed at how perfectly warm and snug it is.  The fabric is soft and the blanket is large enough to wrap around my entire body.  It warms up pretty fast and is the perfect temperature.  For the price - it's a miracle.  My work van is no longer labeled in my mind as: 'the character builder.'
B000HZFDQ4|5|The tire cables were excellent. Super easy to put on and take off. Within 5 minutes I was back on the road, going where I needed to be. Would recommend this set to anybody who needs tire cables.
B004SH2G7G|5|Did the job fixing my leaky return hose on my 1996 silverado!
B007GPE6QG|5|looks great
B004E7TMR2|4|I really like the look and this helmet and it does fit well.  the only thing that I do not like is the chin strap.  The plastic snap that came with it was worthless for riding so after that is removed it fits nicely using the D-rings for the strap.  You have to crank it down pretty tight though because if you don't the helmet will try to roll back on you when you get to about 55-60 mph.
B003UVCY00|5|Bought one for my grandson but was such a wonderful item that I had to get one for myself.
B000FQ7NV8|5|These screwed right in - and fit like a glove.  They changed the whole appearance of my front end.
B004YHQUKE|2|The color is nice and the top is real sheep. However, the straps lost the stretch in just a few months, and now they are falling apart. A few more pennies could have provided decent material for the straps. They are no good if they dont stay on.
B0006301EG|4|It appears to be good quality but I'm not really a good judge since this was my first time to tint.  It was enough to tint two windows and it matches my other tint.
B00BSKYM82|2|I don't normally review products but I could not ignore this request.  3M does a good job of providing material showing you how to prep and apply the product but it took me several cans and numerous hours to get it even remotely looking good. So, instead of a $30 can of spray i ended up spending too much time and money with it.  In my opinion this product should be professionally applied.
B00IZNZOYQ|5|Excellent product, I just use this tool on my 2014 Toyota Rav4. I Highly recommended for 2014 Toyota Rav4 / 4 Cylinders engine.
B006EGAIII|5|Great product, lightweight, strong, well made.
B004X2A682|5|Wow! As stated! Great customer service! Great buy! Fantastic for the inner Batman in all of us! To the bat mobile, Robin!
B000C809II|5|A good quality part for a GM vehicle and the price was very competitive. The Amazon system works really well for ordering parts and great shipping prices. I will continue to purchase from Amazon!
B005EJGSQ2|5|For the price this product is perfect. It is lightweight construction and not wide enough for a full figured buttock, but otherwise perfect and exactly as advertised. Even if I have to buy a new one next year it is far cheaper than a heated seat option or repairing a broken one, which is why I bought it.
B001QXP7QM|5|Awesome stuff. Hides minor imperfections and makes black paint super super glossy.
B00DBEMGP4|5|:)
B004AG8LJM|5|Fit just like a glove. Arrived in the box as new and on time.
B000CLKLSS|2|Box arrived damaged.  Gasket seems to be like oem gasket. Gasket didnt fix my oil leak that just started after an oil change. Leaks right at the front where the oil pan meets the timing cover.<br /> Save money and buy &#34;gasket maker&#34; and make your own. The idea of Reusable gaskets is good but seriously how often do you drop your oil pan? And you still need to use some rtv to hold the gasket up as you can't get the gasket over the dipstick tube if its on the oil pan. And the clips (that this set didnt come with) don't give you enough room to use anyways. Clean up the oil pan, put Gasket Maker on it and be done.
B000KYV99C|5|I received my replacement remote for my 2003 Subaru Outback 2 days ahead of schedule and I was having an issue programing the remote.  I called tech support and my issue was resolved in less than 3 minutes.  World Class service at its best.
B00UC42BBU|5|These mirrors fit perfectly, look great and are well built. Well worth the money.
B0049W0NVQ|5|Work great, so much brighter than stock.
B000IYR6TG|5|This was for a 1999 Grand Am and it was perfect to replace the tired old OEM fans. Installation went well and it was pretty much plug and play. Unfortunately, my car was not triggering the fans to come on and I couldn't find the problem so it involved also adding a new after market Flex-a-lite 31163 Variable Speed Control Module. That was fairly easy though I still have not got my A/C coil triggering the fans. That's 99% me because it is low on Freon and I have not dealt with it. Otherwise the car now runs to about 190 and the fans kick on and purr as they should!
B001RUW4GU|4|Thank you!
B000OOL01K|4|Could be a little tighter.  The plastic business and washers let it wobble.
B004TBOGPG|3|Not quite the same color and not as glossy as the original ain't
B000V2NATA|1|THey sent me a new battery that did not fit the machine they said it would fit.<br />They did not offer any help as far as a return or exchange.<br />I was disappointed
B000CPCBF0|5|Been using Redline gear oil in all my cars.  Great oil. I used for my rear differential on my G37.
B00BFXJL1K|1|JUNK!. returned for repair ,worked  ‎Intermittent would not&#34; back warranty&#34; cost me more have replaced with a second unit I bought for my daughter so I put a red circle with cross on  the Custom LED window tag on my  window and they treated me like some monkey and said it was installed wrong, told them to just keep unit don't want to pay the hour labor for install  other will  brands work better while I think ill put my used breaks back on my truck with metal on metal.. is any rating less than one star.
B00KGICUNG|5|Good service good fit works great.
B006FEFU6Y|3|The sizes run a little small, material is thin. Lighter colors can be somewhat see through. They are cool to wear as regular shorts.
B00480FIEG|5|I bought this for a 2007 Toyota Corolla LE. Originally, I wanted to install HIDs on this car. However, after looking into it, it would have required cutting a wire to disable the Daytime Running Lights (DRL), as well as retrofitting in projectors in order for the HIDs to output light effectively.<br /><br />Dismayed, I decided to look into &#34;higher output&#34; bulbs, not even knowing if such a thing existed. This product is it. Understand, it WON'T and is not meant to output light like an HDI light. That they market it that way is probably the reason they get any bad reviews at all. However, what this bulb WILL do is improve the light output of your standard halogen setup - in my case the light output looks to be about 25% brighter at LEAST (this will depend on your current set up), and the light is much whiter than before. It isn't so white that it borders on blue and is bothersome to the eyes, but it a good, bright, white light. The best part is the price - at ~$30, it is a very very reasonable alternative to a +$200 HID kit, not including retrofitting projectors and any other issues you may have to make an HID setup work.
B005M16QY6|5|Had these knee guards for a while and they fit great and offer a lot of protection had this for almost 6 months and the straps are still holding up strong
B00367NITY|2|I bought this because my wife has a similar one for her Benz.  But boy, I had for under a week and already the SAAB logo is rubbing off.  Holding it, it feels cheap, looks cheap, not exactly what I was hoping for.
B000BZGLW0|5|ok
B00MOQDHUI|1|Have yet to get my keychain....which is half the reason I bought it.
B000WJBGPW|5|Looked confusing out of the box but went together without to much hassle.  Looks great on the bike.  The tips are a nice finishing touch.
B0099RLLQM|5|Mine was a custom application so it required some modification but that was nothing a file and some hand forming couldn't take care of. I may end up making another bracket because this one looks out of place on a 78. But it functions like it should and it got here quick.
B00MO0XQ0U|1|That old saying &#34;YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR&#34; this is a perfect example, spend the 30 bucks for the MOPAR badge..!!
B000E4U1CY|5|after having this door handle from dec 2010 it is still work great on my car 1992 toyota camry.<br />highly durable and recommend to other.
B0010DZZQU|4|The engine air filter fits perfectly, and is cheaper than the price quoted to me for one from the dealership.
B000XEBI9K|5|The only thing missing from this bumper is large lettering that says &#34;I DARE YOU TO HIT ME&#34;, because that's pretty much the message you'll be sending. From now on, parallel parkers will be assured that they can safely scoot your car a few feet into the car in front of you. Never mind the collateral damage--that must have been you, since clearly there aren't any scratches on YOUR bumper and your car is now fused to the one in front of you.<br /><br />So did I make a mistake in rating this bumper five stars? Nope. Let me tell you why--this thing is nearly indestructible. After said events, you may be compelled to tear at this bumper with tooth, nail, scissors, knives, and flame thrower. It will not die! It will not burn, freeze, and happily springs back to pre-mangled shape after all manner of abuse. I now mount mine on cars parked around me :)
B00BSHUH6Q|5|Works perfectly, easy to follow programming instructions. Our Wall-Mart cut these keys for free.
B001JTAM22|5|Super duper cool looking addition to my bmw I love it  and I would recommend people to get this bmw product
B002P8HJTK|5|worked great !
B001TLWJIA|5|Awesome product cuts strap rolling by 75 percent. Wish I had bout one sooner won't be without one again
B001UEJJUC|5|Totally worth it. soo easy to replace. Just look up online how to replace it. would recommend it to anyone trying to improve gas mileage
B002PJ798K|2|It is not easy to install. I have not been able to make it yet. The bolds behind the panel are very difficult to remove.
B00DJC7D3I|5|Stuck on well. Perfect size for Mini Cooper rear window. Cleanly cut
B00EBX20UK|5|This is very funny, came fast and looks just promised. Seems like your typical sticker quality. Not much more to say but I have to...LOL
B00RW3FUZS|5|perfect fit and really nice chrome
B0082ACB8E|4|I got this Thursday evening and installed it by myself within about 5 minutes.  It looks and functions nice.  The only issues I have are the front corners don't seal very well and the material has creases in it where it folds.
B009YRI64C|5|Love the decal..
B0000AY69V|5|The last one I had lasted me 6 years before it got kind of slimy and ineffective.  Figured that's a pretty good value, so I bought another one.<br />If you've been using microfiber or terrycloth towels to dry your vehicle after washing it, give this thing a try and you won't go back.
B001DH4C3U|5|it worked
B00112BKGY|5|What else can I say. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Awesome
B000C5UFK8|5|Fit my 4 runner perfectly!
B00E1S9XBE|5|Ok
B00QXUFCAY|2|Very bright. They look great on my 2010 mazda 3 s   Update*****April 2017  One of these is now not working. It flickers and looks like it short out. These should have lasted the life of the car and certainly the amount of time I owned it. Very disappointed and will not be buying JDMaster again. The second set from that seller to poop out on me in two years. Shame.
B006ENEM92|5|I bought this based on the part #.  ZeroStart 3600008 is not a plug heater as the description states, but a cord for the block heater. Installed this on my 2004.5 Cummins Ram 2500.  The heater is installed from the factory, but there's no cord. It was an easy install and made a world of difference on cold mornings.
B007M0ZCHW|5|After a few years, the loop for the key ring broke on my original factory keypad ('05 Ford Focus) and my keypad would always separate from my keys. So, I purchased this to replace it. All I had to do was switch the the electronic stuff (very technical, I know...) from my original keypad to the new one - and it was ready to go! Unfortunately, six weeks after I replaced my keypad, my husband totaled our car. I can say that in those six weeks, my keypad worked great! I just wish I still had the car to use it with.
B00CC043J0|1|I was diapointrd the way they were shipped all folded up bend now hard to put on wall
B00GXRF64E|1|They fit but not enough sticky stuff
B00062YEJU|5|Great quality.. well made.. easy to install..
B000E4NOLO|5|looks identical to the old one, except new and not covered in 10 years of jimmy rigging. as simple to install as possible.
B003XET6JG|5|Very pretty!
B00GOR5H7O|5|Wonderfully product
B000CM2VK8|5|It was a perfect fit my 1998 Olds Intrigue. It came with strong sticky tape to attach it so make sure you have it lined up before you press it on.
B001GG8CVG|4|Simple directions, easy to use, easy to put on.  Looks great on my vehicle.  I just wish it could go on the inside of my vehicle not on the outside
B000JZD6LQ|4|Another winner from dorman. Bushings seem to hold up very well and the ball joints are always solid.
B001NAQTYC|5|Only brand filter i trust and would recommend.
B00167TYHQ|2|no power
B001KQF6CA|1|We brought this to our mechanic to replace the burned driver's side seat heating pad in our 2003 Suburban.  He tried creative ways to rig up the wiring but this simply does not work with the driver's side seat.  The mechanic said it might work with the passenger side but did not try since we were not replacing that seat.  The product description does not indicate that thisheating pad is only for one of the front seats, so I am very disappointed in this purchase.
B005AU8D0E|5|Installed this on our sandrail, its pretty easy to install but would recommend on having a professional install. This computer is state of the art, will let you program everything on your four cylinder.
B001TWD5GY|3|Installed and working.<br />Wondering if there are either lenses or coloured bulbs available.<br />Maybe Amber or yelllow for construction vehicles?
B00D7T4LX8|5|cute. fits perfect on fingers. luckily haven't had to use this yet!
B008OK2ESE|4|This is a great product if you can keep the air bubbles from under it.
B0087XOTWW|4|Small upgrade and loved it. something that makes people look twice. if your think about it do it! do it!
B003BLSISG|2|These plates could have been a 5 star but when I recieved them and unwrapped it, I noticed that there are several imperfections in the paint.  It almost looks like small chunks of debri got under the paint.  Not too happy.  Returned.
B000BQOO6O|1|Puts out very little it does function barley
B00CPSWKLC|5|Perfect
B00DPYAGVG|5|Arrived on time and as described.
B0031Y82FC|5|Do you wire the mic for the Galaxy DX 959 or do I have to get a plug and have it done somewhere else
B007WICJWA|5|this is real nice looks good
B000TYQB14|3|Not a bad product. After 2 years the three lights on the right side went out. Better than the dealer price of several hundred dollars.
B0031GVBFS|4|I have used this filter before and it worked well. It fits well and works well. It's a cabin air filter and I was surprised at all the dirt it picked up. I haven't installed this one because I haven't reached the 45,000 mile mark but as soon as I do it will be in the car.
B0002Q80RW|4|I bought a couple of these so I could disconnect the maintainer chargers I have on my zero turn mower , ATV ,and my electric start<br /> generator. With the battery chargers plugged in everything is fine , but if you leave them unplugged for an extended amount of time<br />the leds in the charger will drain the batteries, due to back feeding from the battery to the charger. So I just hooked half of the flat extension to the charger , and the other to the battery, Exposed hot wire to charger side as not to ground out battery if wires come in contact with ground when unplugged .Exposed hot side on battery doesn't matter when unplugged due to not having any power going threw it . so I could disconnect the battery when needed. Problem solved. Ease and cheap fix.
B00FZYKSSA|5|fits great
B0042M8VDU|5|I needed a new helmet and wanted to try the flip up full face type. This thing works wonderfully whether your riding around town or romping around on the free way. It's great and doesn't fog up on me and the wind noise is minimal. Definitely recommend if you want riding gear and don't wanna break the bank too much<br /><br />Update<br />On July 31st, 2011 I was involved in a collision with a car at 50MPH. I was injured in the accident but luckily my noggin was intact the helmet worked wonderfully. It cracked but it did what it was supposed to do keep my head together. Definitely will get another one when I get a new bike.
B0009IK5QC|5|The only difference between these blades and standard blades, is they are covered to prevent water from freezing in joints in an attempt to prevent pivot points from locking.  As far as that function goes, they appear to have successfully worked in freezing rain/snow conditions.
B008Y2C45K|4|Heavy duty, had to mod it and weld it on to make it work. Pu it on a 2001 skidoo summit to pull my ice fishing sled.
B005NIRLYC|5|Fit perfectly and runs great
B000VKTUQ4|5|As the title indicates, this fit my Honda crv perfectly.  Of course the Honda design still made installation less than ideal, but the product was as expected.  My air went from weak at full power to quite strong just from changing the filter.  My old filter had bug debris, wings, exoskeletons, etc blocking airflow.  This is highly recommended if you've never changed yours.  If your ac seems weak consider this as a possible culprit.  Remember to keep the white plastic frame from the old filter!!!
B00188ZJGI|4|I'm happy with this purchase so far. Hopefully it will last longer than 2 seasons like all others I have bought in the past!
B000CB94AO|5|Great product, and great price. These aren't easy to find for my 28 year-old car.
B0009V1WS4|5|Use this on my boat trailer and I feel secure against people removing my hitch. Easy to put on and off and protected from the elements, seems like the parts will last a while in the weather.
B001CA9CN8|4|Just what I ordered, But is a hefty price for what it is.
B006YCJ4S2|2|Not a perfect fit; braking was not consistent
B000WEKMVG|5|Great easy to used............
B004SN195A|5|Kinda dumb to spend nearly twenty dollars on valve stem caps, but it does give a polished look to the wheels.  Well made as expected from a BMW product.
B000FPYDN0|5|Is ok
B00QIW16RA|5|The lights are bright and work well. Color is a little lighter red than expected but overall it is good product and seller is a trusted seller to buy frm
B000XBCURW|5|Have used this product twice now... Am very satisfied with its performance... Good repellent...think it helps with UV...No way to prove...used on canvas.
B00MUF1APW|3|Is the $30 / pair JDM ASTAR bulb worth buying ? Well, maybe. I installed these JDM ASTAR bulbs in my two day old Nissan Frontier. My testing shows that the actual light output across the human visible spectrum is lower than a stock 921 bulb by a full f-stop. However, the spectrum of the ASTAR light is weighted toward wavelengths in which humans see more clearly. The most important advantage is that the ASTAR draws considerably less current allowing you to add accessory lights without fear of damaging your backup light switch. I measured the JDM ASTAR at 3½W as opposed to the stock 921 bulb at 17W. You should not allow the total draw to exceed the stock rated 36W if you expect the switch to last as the manufacturer intended. The higher the load, the shorter the life of the switch.<br />.<br />About the tests and the tester ( me ) : I was a radar metrologist ( science of measurement ) for 30 years and hold the appropriate college certificates. Current tests were performed using a two wire measurement method. I did not see the need for four wire methods while reporting margins were as high as 14%. Light value tests were performed both emitted and reflected multiple times with the same result. Reflected values from 50% gray are shown in the graphic.
B000CAZVCU|5|This fit perfectly on my 2003 Subaru Outback with 65k miles. It even came with the grease (not pictured).  Apparently it's a common problem, the front inner CV boot on the passenger side sits right above the catalyst which the heat degrades it quicker.  I was not looking forward to doing this messy job, but I'm glad I did. NO special tools required. It also cost a lot less than getting it done at the dealer. I watched all the Youtube - eric the car guy and others but was confused because everyone did it slightly different. Here is how I did it the easiest way.  Step by step: - Take front passenger wheel off, knock out center cap and re-install wheel. - Borrow or buy a 32mm from store such as Lowes - Loosen axle hub nut but do not take it off yet. You will need to use a 3-4 feet extension steel bar and use a lot of force. Do not drive around with the axle nut loose as it may damage the bearings. - Disconnect lower stabilizer link connection - Remove cotter pin and castle nut at tie rod end of control arm (this makes it a lot easier) - I tried to take off the top bolt of the lower control arm ball joint as listed in Subaru manual but did not come off. Was afraid to take off lower bolt off since I may damage the seal. - So I took off the two bolts at the shock tower. Mark the upper bolt so you don't loose your camber alignment and then take the lower bolt off. - Everything came right off without banging. - push entire wheel assembly away and a slight hammering (softly) dislodges the drive shaft out of the wheel. - Place transmission in neutral so you can turn the axle. - Take air filter housing off to get to the drive axle pin from top. You can do it from bottom but it's tight and can damage the O2 sensor, so I went from top - Turn axle to see pin from top. One end of pin is small the other end is slightly bigger, because it is tapered. I turned axle until big hole is directly on top. - Knock the pin off the drive shaft axle. I used a 16D nail and ground the tip off flat and ground the top of the nail slightly so I can jam it into a universal screwdriver and duct-taped. Not much force is needed lightly hammering taps it right out. - Holding the green cup the whole axle came right off. - Upon inspection the outer CV boot also had some cracks when stretched/ flexed - Cut off boot - Put alignment marks on shaft so everything goes back like original. - Remove inner joint outer race using screwdriver, it's on the inside edge of the green cup. - Wiped the inner boot area clean with rag, the outer boot area I left intact for now. - I did not have a snap ring tool to disassemble the free ring. - Anyway had to go to dealer to get an outer CV boot ($22 w/o straps or grease) straps reused or use plumbing Stainless Steel Hose Clamps. While at dealer used their snap ring tool. - Re-greased the inner boot area and put everything back using the alignment marks and the original snap ring. - Re-install everything back. - Been driving for a week no vibration or any problems.  Total cost for rebooting and re-greasing passenger side drive shaft = $38 and 7 hours labor that includes going to Lowes for 32mm socket and 4 SS hose clamps,  the dealership to get outer boot and one snack/ water / bathroom break. Next time I can probably do it under 2 hours. Good Luck!!!!  UPDATE (12/1/2015) 2 years and 20k miles later ... I was under the car this weekend changing the oil and noticed everything is just fine with the CV boots even the SS plumbing hose clamps are intact, which I was worried if they would last, slightly rusty but intact.This is the only repair my 13 year old Subaru has ever required, besides an AC recharge and O rings.  Most reliable car I have ever owned and I've owned many.  My suggestion for any repair is keep or repair original parts on the Subaru, this car is bullet proof.
B0002UEPVI|5|If you put on a lot it's not clear, but if you put on a small amount it's very clear, I used it for my car and it sealed perfectly.
B0011UXY9W|4|it has a great deal of bite on the rotor. The only downside, like in most other Hawk pads IMHO, is that they can dust up something fierce from time to time.
B002M2OITI|3|I order 4 sparkplugs  and one came broken. hope to get replacement for the broken one. and i will rate 5 stars. thanks and blessings
B0051D3MP6|5|Really good battery tender. very simple and to the point but does a great job. You really dont need anything else. Highly recommended
B0019CWHEK|4|great
B005NLQAHS|5|I had one of the Orange and Blue scan tools sold on this site and it was slow to connect, Would drop connections,<br />and after about 3 months stopped working altogether. I purchased this item and it does seem to be higher quality. The tool is a little heavier than the generic one. It paired up on the first try very quickly and connected to the Torque app and worked perfectly<br />with no drop outs. This cleared codes faster than the other scan tool as well. Worth the extra cost.
B007Y3BKNC|5|Great Item!!
B002ZLHWJO|5|Ordered these for my 09 a4. Exactly what I needed. Literally 5 seconds to change! Don't go to the dealer and pay $50+ just order these.
B0000AXPDU|3|Strong and well made item for the money. I had to use 2 flat washers (each 3/32\\" thick) to enable me to use it on my 2005 Jeep Liberty as the Jeep center cap on the spare wheel prevented the outer casing of the lock from inserting all the way down so that the key could be turned. No big deal, still a good buy!
B000AD0VOW|3|missing bolts, and I think the price is too high, can't believe I paid almost  $150.00 for a piece of PLASTIC!!
B00L2QM806|5|Love how it shades my baby without hindering me being able to see
B000GZKMPC|5|looks good, works good, glad I bought it.
B006XM5XWY|3|Got these for my 91 Capri. They are shiny and they look good but I'm not feeling much improvement over the stock flat face rotors. If I could do it again I think I might pass on these.
B00M2DU3NM|1|Inserts came of the mount and dropped my GPS down the road.
B006VN3GHY|3|I bought this kit to install it in my 2007 Xterra but I don't know if I just couldn't figure out the installation or I was missing a piece or something but this didn't work. I returned the first one thinking I had a defective unit and they replace it with no problems, tried again and it just didn't work.
B00BJN0KA2|5|great thanks
B000C71WQW|5|Works great! No squealing.
B00529YXJ8|5|👍
B00C80I67E|5|We purchased the lights to mount on our son's power wheels police car.  They were a hit!  He loves them!  Super bright.
B0024E6QX0|5|Works great. Exact fit. No more waking up with sun in your face! Nice quality too. Worth the money completely.
B00B21R0TA|2|One projector has a straight cutoff. Other has a bowing / curved cutoff. Quality control is not good but is good for the price..
B00HUC6HRQ|5|Great product at a great price and super fast delivery! Thank you
B006CSSKCO|5|This product worked perfectly for me on my vrx785bt unit. Bypasses the ebrake without having to use any toggle switch.
B000QFQE68|5|Great for conditioning softball gloves
B000OUW7XE|4|There are fancier tools, but this did the job more than adequately for me. I dont have a lot of use for this tool but since it allowed me to buy the parts and install them myself at a saving of about 65% over the quoted price at the muffler shop, I would definately do it again. Lubricate the threads before use.
B00KML1SVW|1|I really wanted to like this product, and was especially attracted to the handlebar mounted remote control, but the overall operation makes it one to pass up, in my opinion.<br /><br />First, battery life is only about 4 hours and then you have to disconnect the headset from the base unit in order to recharge.  I bought this for use on a motorcycle to connect with my GPS unit and frequently am out all day long, which makes this useless in the last half of the day.<br /><br />For some reason, when the GPS sends a voice message out, the first 1/4 - 1/3 of the message is &#34;suppressed&#34; as though the audio has to &#34;spool up.&#34;  This means you frequently miss the gist of the message and have to divert your eyes from the road to see what the GPS is trying to tell you.<br /><br />Finally, the quality of audio from the speakers provided is so low as to render the thing completely useless for listening to built-in FM tuner and (I presume) tunes from your phone.<br /><br />I was given a recommendation for a different brand and will be trying that.  In short - don't waste your money.
B0089LOCSI|5|Part was as advertised and came in a reasonable amount of time and cost was also reasonable, buit with freight added I could have bought it locally for a bit less.
B000TKHMWK|4|I would rate this product value for money. I did expect it to be more powerful but it certainly serves the purpose that I require it for. I think that this would be a tremendous asset in the event of a powercut.[[ASIN:B000TKHMWK Duracell DPP-600HD Powerpack 600]]
B000M5Y720|5|Good quality product
B000C6IVUS|5|Good deal.  Perfect fit
B008YJA43M|2|You will need to buy some silicone for these. don't use the rocker box covers, they don't fit well and you only get 8 total. they look good though, just can wait till I have to remove them if I do any engine mods, they will get destroyed when they have to be removed, the only thing I like about them, is they look good, and the small ones that go on the timing cover, primary, trans cover all press on good so there is no need to glue them on. get regular rocker bolts replaced by the dealer, and it will look a lot better.
B000COMX54|5|My order was delivered promptly upon ordering.  The lock set was a perfect fit for my e39 M5.  I would recommend this product for other e39 owners.
B0009V1WS4|5|the item came as advertised and is easy to use.  it is great to have both sizes included with it because I use both sizes.
B003IS3HV0|5|We have two green leather sofas that are over 12 years old.  They were in rough shape having lived in our family room and having been subject to over a decade of life with children as well as the effects of a wood stove.  Unfortunately I didn't take before and after pictures because two coats of Leather Honey restored these sofas to a soft lustrous finish.  Leather Honey even restored the color where the sofas had been \\"bleached out\\" by the sun!  Applying the product is a physical task (you realize why it's called Leather \\"Honey\\") but the results are worth it.  I recommend this product.
B005SUY8TQ|5|Worked Great on my 1995 Yamaha TW200 will get one more just in case.
B001RBCU90|5|I just put this on my back windshield today and it's absolutely adorable. This is the first time I have ever put any type of sticker on my car, so I wanted a message that really meant something to me, and this was it. Something worth mentioning: in the picture where you see the black, all those areas are clear (no black). However, when you put this on, it will appear black against the window. I only write this so no one is surprised, when they receive their sticker. It's also very easy to install and comes with great directions! This is so darn cute and I love the message!
B001P11SCM|5|Yes I Use two of them
B008AJP8RI|4|Cool product, and for the price ....
B00A6SU6SM|5|Great repair manual it has all of the information I need to keep my engine in tip top condition
B00LCBLRHG|5|These do a great job!  Prop the hood open to the FULLEST EXTENT!  I can't recall it ever being opened this wide from factory!!  0 sagging!
B0013REXO8|2|Good fit, look great. Edit:  screws rusted after a year.  Bad.
B000C16XKS|3|Well, I'm very happy to have an operational window again. So far I have not had any problems with the way it's been working. However, I second the other reviewer who stated that the part is backward; down goes up, up goes down. I guess no one else had this problem, otherwise I'd assume it would have been mentioned a few more times on here. Not such a big deal to me, just seems like a bit of false advertising.
B0050EITTK|4|Easy hook up and will be great for our unit. It is not too heavy that we can't disconnect and haul with us and hook up at the next stop. Price is good, have not had to regenerate yet. We have a carbon filter on before the inlet to extend life. Should have got it a long time ago.
B003NOAM94|5|Best price
B00FBKSDDA|2|Work great.. for about a month before one light died.
B00GBQ771C|5|Excellent oil filters
B006RW5NNY|4|Bien!!
B000CO7AMK|1|Not happy, received one broken light (won't turn on). They are EXTREMELY falsely advertised. NOT BLUE in in the slightest, NOT any brighter than stock lights. Waist of money and time.
B00BB1D2KW|5|Very nice product.  Easy to put on and look great.
B001SL9LL4|2|The butterflies look nice, but the wheel cover keeps slipping position on the steering wheel, and the fuzzy bits are wearing off in record time.<br /><br />So somewhat pretty, mostly irritating.
B00UVYS1B0|3|Got two of these. They look the same as my original Mazda key, but no logo on the back of the key. They also feel lighter and more flimsy than the original key. They were cut and programmed at my car dealership with no issues. The remote lock/unlock seems to work fine, but the one of the keys is now getting stuck in its folded position, and the release button doesn't do anything. I have to pry it out of the case with another key or just not fold the key - annoying, but you get what you pay for. If they continue to function at least to start the car, still worth the savings compared to brand name key fobs.
B0086ZNB4S|1|I only attached one to use on the drivers side. It broke within a month. I've used the other brand for years. Thought I'd try these. The clamp broke off when I tried to close it.
B00631O9AW|5|It is perfect! The Color is great and it serves its intended purpose. It makes my Jetta keys easy to find.
B000CRI1C0|1|blade was damaged and cost moor in shipping than the cost of the blade I could have bought it at auto parts store  and saved the over sized box was a joke ill  think hard before shopping here...
B00CFBTC9W|5|Perfect fit for my 06 Elantra manual transmission
B005NLCGF8|5|Despite warnings about using this with Fords, I ordered one of these anyway (we also have a Dodge minivan, so it'll get used).  The delivery was faster than promised (kudos, Amazon!).  The device got power as soon as I plugged it into my Focus' OBD jack, was fairly simple to pair with my Acer Iconia A500, and started pushing information to Torque Lite as soon as I selected the data source in Torque Lite's menu.  Within minutes, I was defining graphs and dials to monitor various engine data, learning more about what my Ford's \\"normal\\" looks like -- and leading me to want to replace my O2 sensors.  I was hoping to get codes on my ABS light, but there were no codes posted.  Not sure what codes Torque Lite queries, so that may not be a shortcoming of this scanner.  Overall -- very pleased.
B0007ZK3S2|5|Good quality
B00K23V1A8|4|Great product but had to weld it to my buddy club spec 3 exhaust. Not sure if they sell a bolt on but that would've been better.
B00L374ZRS|4|Seems fairly well made but gotta modify them and my car slightly to get em in.
B00F64N052|5|A great addition to my jeep and at a good price. Received early and installed before long trip.
B0025CV8M0|3|It was NOT cosmetic damage.  Half of the connector was broken off!
B004IJQ4M2|1|Item broke on first use
B0015DQ81G|5|Received quickly and exactly as advertised.
B002GTPEEU|5|These work great! I highly recommend it.
B0023VOVVS|5|Perfect condition great quality product.
B000BPTU6O|1|This sure is not the old Rain Dance that I used to buy years ago (Blue stuff). This wax formulation is difficult to apply and to remove, and it does not last but a few weeks before water fails to bead on it. Even though the new Rain Dance and the old Rain Dance is made by the same Florida company, they have taken a gigantic leap backwards with this product. Would I buy it again.....NO WAY!
B008D6UY0O|1|Don't Get it!!!<br />I got 2 thing from this seller. and both of the stickers I got were BAD.<br />When I went to put one of the sticker in my car. IT STICK'T to the other paper SO I needed to Heated up and make it stick to the original paper so it can stick on my CAR. ITS complicated.<br />JUST don't buy. TRUST
B00GOHST6U|5|Haven't stuck this sticker yet, but Tue quality seems top notch and they give u a sample sticker to practice with so u get it right on the real deal
B001DRHMMS|5|Excellent product, very affordable!
B003YHN66Q|5|Nice replacement battery for the M109R.
B00C4XFMO0|5|Ice cold AC after recharge
B001EOYJSU|5|I installed this in my 2012 Forester Touring.  This receiver is very well made. All welds looked great and the metal is a heavy gauge.  Comparing this to the factory receiver is no contest.  The vehicle will rot away before this thing does.  The installation was relatively easy (I'm rather mechanically inclined, but this can be done by any novice.  Just make sure to take your time.).<br /><br />I would advise to anyone installing this to check out the tutorial on [...].  They have detailed instructions as well as a how to video.  Some reviewers say to remove the exhaust from all of the hangers and lower it, but trust me its easier just to remove the rear mufflers.  Just remove the two bolts at the flange (be careful to preserve the gasket), then remove the muffler from the two exhaust hangers (squirt some wd-40 on each hanger for easy removal).  Repeat for the other muffler.  With hand tools it takes about 4-5 minutes per muffler.  Once you have the two mufflers off you have access to everything.  You'll need to enlarge the rear holes (described in the video).  TIP: Make sure to enlarge the rear holes slightly larger than you think you'll need.  You have to snake the bolts through the holes.  Just because the bolt appears to fit through doesn't mean it will fit with the snake attached. Notch the front holes with drill bit to fit the plates and the head of the bolt to fit through.  When it comes to snaking, I advise watching the video again to see how they do it.  Its extremely easy to do.  Just make sure you do it right the first time because fishing the bolts/plates back out would not be fun. Once you have the bolts through, have a friend help you hold the receiver in place to start threading the nuts (BE CAREFUL NOT TO PUSH THE BOLTS BACK INTO THE FRAME!). After that, crank it down and re-install the mufflers (reverse the uninstall directions).<br /><br />Minimal tools required:<br />- Socket Wrench (both muffer and receiver)<br />- 14mm socket (muffler removal)<br />- 14mm wrench (muffler removal)<br />- Socket for installing receiver nuts (can't remember the size)<br />- Small flat screwdriver for removing hole plugs<br />- WD-40 or other aerosol silicone based lubricant<br /><br />Additional Recommended tools<br />- Torque Wrench.  Instructions say torque to 75lbs.  As long as you tighten them securely with out going to wild you can get by without it.<br /><br />Happy installing!  Feel free to leave a comments or questions.<br /><br />Note:  The maximum vehicle trailer weight allowed by this receiver is 4000lbs and has a maximum tongue weight of 400lbs.  I would advise not going past your vehicles limits.  My 2012 Forester says not to exceed 2400lbs trailer weight and 250lbs tongue weight.  Check your manual for details.
B007ZGKKMA|5|Living in florida warm and humid summers i now will mow at night time. i have a small 650 CCA Battery in my garden tractor i just cut the wire going to headlights and stripped them and 2 wire nuts lights have power with key switch. lights up a good 300' a good 100' where it is plenty bright for mowing where you can see your cut line. i mowed 2 1/2 acres and mower was still fine very little battery drain. no more mowing in the dangerous sun, humid heat.
B006Q3JI44|4|Good
B008BX75TW|2|The main headlights are fine. But the secondary lights suck the leak they are BRAND NEW GARBAGE.
B008FK71KY|1|Product arrived, only the 'F' and fox symbol are included, the 'X' was NOT included.
B00BCH4WTA|5|hello,<br />  looking for a good plastic bottle for holding and spraying liquids? these are far better than the ones at the local stores.  they are well built and spray quite well.  they are handy for spraying as the neck is narrow enough to grab easily and the trigger is right there for gripping.  we needed a good sprayer to fill up with a floor cleaner solution. have dry cloths handy and need some wet mopping? get out your plastic bottle and start spraying. the mops like swiffer have wet and dry cloths for the mop heads.  if you do not have wet cloths,  spray the floor, use the dry mop cloths and they turn into wet mopping to clean tile floors like a champ.  sometimes the wet cloths run out of cleaning liquid, but this sprayer just keeps putting more cleaner to get the job done. yrmv...great product and fast delivery.
B005JI6ZZW|5|The above product was correct and spot on as advertised. I received the product on time,fit perfect and color was dead on.Was easy to install and works great.I would buy this product again.
B00AK534VW|4|These BMW socks feel great and are super for those cool and/or cold days.  They come up just over calf muscle high, have an additional padding on the left sock, and seem to hold up very good at washings.  I have been using SOKZ Winter socks, and still do, but these may take their place.  The only negative is they're pretty darn high on the price chart.
B0038AV968|4|Love the brand new feel it gives my cobalt. I had yellow hazy headlights and these  gave it a fresh look. Would recommend it,  Although moisture still gets into these headlights and fogs it up for a bit. Goes away when it evaporates. Not a perfect fit but I really can't complain too much. 4/5
B000CC9CDM|4|Very nice sound and beautiful muffler but no note to certify the approval in UE.<br />Thanks to give me one.
B002FE3VLE|5|The headlamp assembly was delivered very quickly!  It was exactly what I ordered.  Great price!  Would recommend this product and seller to anyone wanting to replace there car parts.
B002PV0XRM|5|I was told by several auto mechanics that replacing ignition coils and spark plugs for my 2005 Mazda MPV van was going to cost upwards of $1000. I researched auto zone and Pep boys but I could not get the igniter coils for less than $60 a piece. However, when I saw the price on Amazon for the coils at about $10 a piece I couldn't believe my eyes. I read the reviews and I decided it was worth the risk. I had the job done for less than $400. So far the van is perfect! I highly recommend!!!
B00B2YHFO2|5|Work great for my dome lights!  Nice clean white color and plenty bright.  As others have said, if they don't work the first time, flip them around.
B009FO0BRY|5|Excelente producto.
B00HYFCESK|5|A very high quality product! Installed in a few minutes...rock solid and already in use on my jeep. OH, by the way; a great price too!
B008MXQ1SC|5|I installed 9 of these bulbs in my cab over truck camper. Turned them all on last night and you'd think the sun was still shining outside. The cool white color is easy on the eyes and no more heat and melted plastic from my old bulbs.<br />This item is a must have for all you boodockers out there.
B000ALG8E6|5|Perfect match
B000EQ3VPG|5|Don't buy Napa's theyre made in China and theyll last ya about 6 months. Not to mention they don't have a warrenty
B003BL1H0M|2|Hooked it up, not enough 3m tape. It comes with screws to install. I tossed those out. Bought some high quality 20lb double sided tape to mount. Fyi I've installed several of these, you can't beat the safety of having a fire stripe!<br />The back up lights won't work. Hooked up to the reverse light and it wouldn't work.<br />Also, FYI, use a silicone sealant on any connections. I've blown 2 bars in the last two years. Heed my warnings.
B00J5BETSE|5|Haven't used these but I'm sure they'll work great
B0016KH254|5|worked fine
B000CPCBF0|3|Well I was hoping it would quiet the differential whining when shifting thru gears but no such luck. I have 2009 manual trans. and not use to the noise but I guess I will get use to it.
B00C448P9S|3|Good stuff for the money
B004YZ3W9I|2|KnuKonceptz has great wire and I have always been happy with any gauge I have bought from them: That said these teminals? Not so great. The wire doesn't want to stay in them and the terminals don't fit the battery poles well at all. I broke both of the pair trying to get them to work. NOT on a par with anything else I have bouhgt from this company. A rea disappointment!
B003CX963Y|4|Fits my Pontiac Solstice GXP almost to custom specs.  No problem with it keeping out dust and dirt and it doesn't absorb water so functionally, it works.
B001D20X4W|4|Just placed in car. also placed a fabric soften sheet in with it to help with any odors. lol<br />Keep the faith
B00BX7BPK8|5|great value
B0010Z4MDK|5|This battery worked great in my Black & Decker Grass Hog Trimmer.  IT's not specifically listed for that device but it is exactly the same size, voltage and amp-hour rating and easily replaces the old original battery.
B000IDYKNC|5|nice for on a keychain, doesn't get in the way!
B000C31J9G|5|For only a little more than a \\"cheap\\" filter this has been a great product. I've had the CA8755A on my 2003 Tahoe for the past 26k miles and according to the factory \\"indicator\\" for the filter it is \\"like new\\". I've bought a TGA8755A to replace it. It seems to be almost the same, the only difference I see is that the TG is \\"oiled\\" (but I see the same mentioned for this product in some places also), and it costs less right now. Either way it is a winner. (I would pick one of these over the CA8755 or CA8756 that'll you see. Those cost the same, are lighter duty and/or old versions. It looks like this 8755A is the new \\"standard\\" model.
B000OCH4YO|5|works great..very soft and holds soap good
B005DCKRP8|5|After a month or so I noticed a few stones had fallen off
B0050QF9KA|5|Nice!!!
B002TIGUTG|4|Cute! I love chickens.
B002FYS2DG|4|just the right part
B004MF95AA|5|I am happy with my recent purchase of the powerlet rigid powerlet to cigarette socket adapter for my motorcycle, it gives me the ability to plug in  accessories to my motorcycle.
B00029J2L2|3|Not all that soft, but it will keep the dust off of my Mustang. The fit is good and that was the must important concern that I had because this was not listed for my 1965 fastback Mustang.
B000IZGIA8|5|Once I was able to design, build and install a gasoline powered bunsen burner into my steering wheel desk, I had created the perfect product.  I hope the manufacturer is listening, because every mad scientist I know would LOVE to have this installed in their car, van, or hearse.  Now, I can cruise comfortably as I mix solutions and scheme about my plans for world domination, all without spilling a drop of my evil potions!    The debate is settled, the science is clear; this is the best product invented since the lightbulb.  You can go on the interwebs and verify that Al Gore agrees with the growing consensus of evil mad scientists.  I just hope that OEMs will start offering this in a standard option package.  Imagine, a bunsen-burner equipped steering wheel workbench, a jacob's ladder in the back window, glaring eye headlights, an exhaust-hood/sunroof, and an incubator-equipped center console, it could be the perfect option package.    My wife is a baker, and she says she can't live without one of these.  She kneads one real bad in her van.    I'll be buying these for everyone on my Christmas list this year!  Thanks for a stupendous product!
B0000AY69V|5|After using chamois, microfiber cloths and everything in between, I bought the absorber.  It really works.  It is almost like a magnet that draws water to it.  I use it to dry our cars after washing and now would not use anything else.
B0016ZU3AU|4|These things lasted on my Odyssey for 3 years in Northern California weather. They are now finally falling apart and streaking. Lasted longer than expected
B00166LS1W|5|I found these converters to be just as advertised. They work perfectly. They were delivered promptly and in perfect condition. They are small and easy to carry.
B002H3DSRA|5|So far so good. Been on our car for a couple months now and still looks new. Wish it was smaller but nobody seems to make them for a decent price any more.
B000Q0CVXS|1|Listed as a correct kit for the rear brakes of 2004 Acura TL.  The four clips that support that brake pads on the bracket are too big. The center portion of these clips that slip into the bracket are too wide and would be pretty deformed if you pushed hard enough to get them on. Not wanting to risk having to take them apart again if it developed a noise or problem, I ended up reusing the old ones. The other two anti rattle clips that go into the caliper fit just fine.
B007K26AVO|5|These lights where the best thing that happened to my 2003 Chevy Tahoe Z71! If you do not own a pair of these you're losing big-time...
B003OB2N8E|3|Very tight fit. Does have a little extra material you will need to trim to fit.
B0081KOQ7Y|5|I have used alot of polish, but Hd advanced polish so far is the best by far is the best to get youre swirls out of the paint.
B000RDLBFS|4|Worked great, received it promptly and saved a few dollars. It appeared to be identical to the OEM parts and the quality of Wix is excellent
B0028JW4PU|4|I bought this to do some work on my wife's car and it worked just fine. great for the price
B00A82FZFK|3|ok,,, they are pretty well made , only complaint is they are really 3 different led one for each color about a half inch apart , so if you want red ,green, or blue its fine ,,, however if your looking for yellow, purple, orange . then its not very good because they are too far apart to mix colors well.
B001GS0D98|5|Does as is advertised.  My advice is to get someone who knows what they are doing to do the install.  Can be frustrating, but the quality of the product is great.
B00FKPJKBU|5|Great replacement for interior lights of a pop up camper. brighter and less heat than the factory lights.
B003ZOH63W|2|It did not get the result I was expecting with the upgrade.  The signal was worse with it  No I will not recommended to any body.
B0089GTC92|5|This product fit my 2005 Mercury Mountaineer great.!! install was easy and it looks great. I recommend this product today
B001AVYVSA|1|Put this into my 7.3 and I had issues a few days later... I wouldn't touch this with a 10' pole... Sure it would be hard to prove it was this stuff's fault but it was the only thing new injected into my system.<br /><br />Use at your own risk.  I'll stick with my normal POWER SERVICE DIESEL KLEEN that I have used for years with no issues..
B000C55ZXA|3|its an a  OK product but it does not fit my car which renders it useless,not worth my time to send it back unless amazon cares to send the right one or refund disappointed.
B00826LQBG|5|works fantastic
B0002STTSY|5|These ratcheting type crimpers make far superior crimps compared to the stamped cheapo types, wish I had bought one years ago.
B009G7VG10|5|I was so excited to get this dressage horse decal. Very nice size and lets the world know you support dressage. I may have to get a few more for barn window and tack box.
B001B5E8UQ|5|Installed easily and works great
B0027UMX6U|5|Works perfect for my needs. Thanks
B00063X7KG|5|I would highly recommend this product. It really does leave your car as smooth as glass. I could clearly feel the difference before and after.
B004LF13GA|5|perfect replacement
B0079S35Z8|5|The sticker is amazing, fits well, and The Meaning and Message behind it is beautiful. I definitely recommend getting one of their stickers, no matter what, and put it on a place where everyone can see
B004QHOOE6|5|Definitely a good product from Muteki. Love how these lugnuts look on gray wheels.
B00KLZ65GM|4|I really like this mask. It fades when you wash it but  I still like it a lot
B00EYK56TC|5|perfect
B004R4WSF0|5|Gave me more than enough clearance without having to change the neck in my old trailer
B00317DNLM|5|The decals are really nice, clear crisp colors and stick really well, I love them...
B00JREJ7N6|5|looks great! works great! used for the first time in dark blizzard conditions...made my stock brights look like candles :)
B00RV789R6|5|great fit
B001F85OUM|3|causes light warning (bulb out)2012 harley softail
B008HTGX0W|4|Handy to find this though thought the backround was black instead of clear, still looks great in the car's interior.
B000GKD5NI|3|suction cups dont stay stuck very well in back glass.  other than than no compliants (blocks maybe 75% of sun)
B00DNXU8XA|5|Very nice and smooth..
B004DRPOU2|5|great price and quick shipped, made the night into day with the new headlights. This set came with the new light bulbs. wow
B003DNFKPQ|5|I got the Mid Size Sedan and it fit like a glove. I love the zipper on the driver side door. You couldn't ask for anything more. This works great.
B00310FO8Y|5|The way the shape deflects wind was an unexpected surprise
B002XL2I0Y|5|I bought this because a car I purchased had the battery held down with a bungie cord.  I ended up not needing the bottom tray, but by drilling a hole in the original plate, I was able to use the side bars and the top handle, and it worked great!  Not to mention it was cheaper to get this whole kit than just the pieces i needed. All in all, a nice kit and a great value.
B001GBQ47A|5|Absolute best lights out there. Use these in my 2010 Ford F150 XLT Super Crew.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Must have for any ford truck<br />-Extremely bright and still street legal<br />-Much farther throw and better spill to sides<br />-Color of light works better for illuminating road signs and seeing animals that would otherwise blend in with nature<br />-You can see right off the bat how bug of an improvement these are<br /><br />Cons<br />-Cost is astronomical<br />-Only last 6 months to a year at best-closer to 6 months<br /><br />Overall I cannot put a price on vision and safety so these are a must have for anyone who needs the extra vision.
B00EKTJ7I8|5|lookes great on the car. it makes it stand out more than usally. well pleased with the item. will order again.
B00029JLD6|5|good
B00FZE2U72|5|Unique and funny
B00KTJ0A0C|5|Fobs were one quarter the price of those in auto/retail stores.  Work great, vendor did  a great job getting the FOBS to me ahead of schedule.
B000HUK9C2|5|Fel-pro is usually a leader when it comes to making gaskets.  I didn't end up using these, purchased for my mechanic who was changing the starter on my BMW, but they ended up going from underneath and didn't take the intake manifold off.  The box said for BMW models with the M50 engine which was mine, so if you have a 1994 BMW 525i, this should work, even if the Amazon part thing says it won't fit, for some reason its wrong 30% of the time.
B004KG8DD6|4|Having a properly sprung front end is a large change. well worth it.<br /><br />If using on a 2000-2001 DRZ400S you will need to make or use ~2&#34; spacer in each fork due to spring length differences.
B000NXBP2G|4|It doesn't ask you what color you would like before you order...like the style...i like them...hoping they send  me black please......[[ASIN:B000NXBP2G BAK 880 80\\" Universal Running Board]]<br />i received my running boards they are nice and they sent ne black
B00390BS7C|5|I find shopping for tools online hard without looking at the build quality first, this tool came in quite handy and has a very low profile design made for tight spaces. It handled the abuse I threw at it quite well.
B004EDCR0U|4|Was hoping these would be more flexible than my current older ones, but they're still very hard to stretch over the pins.
B002HRPQYO|5|My Lexus 350 is a great car but it is really lacking when it comes to storage compartments. It only has one large deep compartment in the center counsel. My phone doesn't fit in the small tray when it is plugged in. I purchased this so that my phone would stay in place. It works great. With the phone there isn't much room for anything else, but that is fine with me.
B005TMIKYM|5|Great price and it works great also.
B00CSX42WY|1|Got yellow within a few weeks.
B000GZQJTK|5|Very pleased with this purchase.  Shipped quickly and product was just as described.  Caliper cover was easily installed and the instructions were easy to follow.
B002TS2G9Y|5|Great little lights . Will work great on my saddle bags.
B000ZGXIFI|5|The radiator fit perfectly and included everything need to complete the job. It has been three months and the product is fine so far.
B000CDADO8|5|Great product.  Highly recommend.
B00HQZNOQO|4|it fits exactly and no troubles installing. A perfect replacement.
B000CQBNDU|5|Perfect for the person that needs to remove a battery for a season. Easy to install and easy to use.  I use them on my lawn and garden tractor.  Take the battery out and bring it in to stay warm.  Then when I need to do my driveway I bring out the battery and it connects in seconds not tools needed.  Great product.
B002GUUVKQ|5|I could put Hello Kitty everywhere in my house car and work (if they would let me) I just love everything Hello Kitty
B000IYFXRI|5|These lift supports were a perfect, easy to install replacement for the original component in my 2009 Chevy venture van.  With the assistance of my wife to hold the rear lift hatch open the replacement of both lifts took about 15 minutes with a few screw drivers. You will need a star head (T30 torx) screw driver to remove the tail-light assembly and a flat-head screw driver or small pry tool to pop off the clips at the top and bottom of the existing lift supports.  There are excellent YouTube videos that demonstrate the procedure in detail - it is worth watching the video before attempting the repair.  Here is an example that helped me.    [...]
B004P0QR3K|4|Really moves traffic. Installed them in my grill. Love them. But the controller is a lil cheesy.
B000B69V7Q|5|GREAT PIECE. FIT NICE.
B000VU91SG|5|Great mat! Works perfect in my F150. Seems to be holding up well to the abuse I put it through daily.
B004ZF4MW8|5|Installed on 2012 Mazda CX-9. Be sure to review the install diagram prior to install of course but this couldn't have been easier. It was literally plug and play. Simply remove your halogen bulbs, plug the cooresponding plugs into each other (make sure you have negative and positive connected properly) and thats it. The ballast and other components fit into the low-beam assembly no problem so I didn't have to drill my assembly cap or mount the ballast in the engine bay. You'll need to remove the coolant reservoir on the passenger side to access the low beam assembly; three bolts; simple. The only hiccup I had was the connector from the vehicle to the ballast, it didn't seem to snap into place as easily as it would have been as the reverse red/black for example. Ensure the polarity is correct; I had to add pressure until the connectors snapped into place. It was just odd that it was extremely easy for the connectors to snap into place when the incorrect polarities were lined up.
B004HV8OYC|5|I purchased the car seat covers and accessories for my daughter and she absolutely loves the set!  The quality of the material isn't the toughest so handle with care.<br />The items were delivered quickly and I will definitely shop with this seller again!
B00A93TOWS|5|Good quality at competitive price.<br />My husband loved it and this is what counts! I actually bought two of them, the other one is black.
B000B68V6I|5|Thank heavens for a fuel saver...power outages and generators make this product miraculous. A++++ quality. Keep it handy.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Love it!!  I have a f-150 and have no issues.  It works.
B00CEX4L9W|5|get a lot positive of comments on it.  Fits the door perfect.
B00DPI9I4S|5|Work much better than the old Ranchos in my lifted Wrangler.
B00029WVJC|5|They worked as they should
B005F2WK56|5|It is easy to install and so much cheaper than autozone or any other shops. Has been doing the work just fine!
B002K4M3DQ|5|My son wanted this player poouch for Christmas & loved it.  It was just what he wanted.  Very sharp looking.
B00K7IESUI|1|no instructions or parts list  saying what was what
B0036NEUW2|5|Wonderful gift for a football fan. My nephew loved them and placed them in his vehicle promptly. The quality of the mats were excellent, thick rubber construction and well made.
B001Q6EE86|1|pump deliverd in june failed in augest. ran generator 4 times and pump started leaking from case.If i diddnt go down below for some ropes to tie something off i would have never known it was leaking and the situation could have been deadly.. Very dangerous situation would not recomend this pump to anyone ever!!!!
B000C9SH2C|5|Fit my 2003 pontiac grand prix with a 3100 engine just fine.  You install it on the drivers side close to the rear wheel..  Either back up a set of ramps or jack the car up accordingly to have easy access.  Will buy from again!
B00Q2WHVL6|5|Arrived instantly with great quality and fit.
B00718VZ8A|5|Don't waste your time with anything else.  These are heavy duty, easy to place and a breeze to pull out.  Worth the price.
B00F3FJMKG|4|very very nice product I just wish that it was sold good larger about. good quality and a powder coating really makes it look awesome!
B00L2QM806|4|Nice product... Completely satisfied... This is what I needed. Thanks
B00080QHMM|5|Well, it does everything it is ought to do. Happy with he quality so far, plus display is very readable even in the sun.
B005GGLXCM|5|this stuff is expensive and the results are worth it. long lasting, water repellent, not too shiny. works on black metal parts like wipers as well to restore to like new condition and protect from UV rays. Living in Florida and parking outside this product is necessary to keep the black parts looking good.
B001OBMOKI|2|Nice product, but doesn't really fit the Astro correctly. The hub flange is .200 thicker than OEM so the available stud (lug) length is reduced by that much. This only leaves .5&#34; of threads if you have alloy rims.
B002X6VXL4|5|We bought this product after my husband's car started having an intermittent problem with starting that his mechanic could not fix.  We keep it in the car so it can be started whenever we need it.  It is not too large or heavy and it works.  Just what we needed!  Also, the air compressor is handy for topping off your tires.
B000CB360S|5|does the job
B00J3218PC|5|Have used this brand for years and works great
B0013GHAV2|4|The wheel cover did not fit my car so make sure you know the measurements<br />before you order. Besides that I am very pleased with the shoulder pads,<br />they fit well and are comfortable. I have to mention the print is even better in person than<br />the picture if you ask for my opinion.
B0056JC170|5|Bought it for son in college to place on his laptop cover...he loved it!
B004RCWXW0|5|Appears well made. Very low standby power usage. Fan stays off on standby and kicks in when load is applied.  The fan is fairly loud.  Would not recommend if you are going to be close by while using it for long periods of time in a quiet environment.  The fan noise would probably be get annoying after a while.
B0075Y0464|5|I have to check these out right away I love my pooh bear ,... I bought 3 different one 2 in my back window on the back of my trunk ... they are just adorable .... shipping was good came with instructions .... simple enough!
B00KWGSKA4|5|Arrived just as described
B003Y323NC|5|Like it much better than the round gauges to monitor all the vitals of my 2011 RAM.
B0016IR5GC|5|Worked great.Don't wait too long or might have to replace your trans.(based on reviews) Made of all aluminum,even the fittings.
B003IS3HV0|5|I have a Ford King Ranch this product made my seats feel like new. I would definitely recommend this product
B0074EJ9QQ|5|I loved my steering wheel cover and it looks great. It was the color I wanted and matches every thing
B0006VORDY|5|Excellent cooker. I have typically used the low, single burner type. This is high, much easier on back and can do fries and fish at the same time
B0001EW03U|2|I did not seem material that is manufactured, I thought it was more resistant.
B000PIE3CS|5|This antenna works great. Give me the bump I need. I work in the oilfield so there are a lot of dead spots. With the signal booster and antenna not as many dead spots.
B00IJ43O6Q|5|I was able to easily install the new lift support once I figured out how to remove the old one. The lift is working like a charm, and I save almost $100 compared to what the dealer was going to charge me to rplace the defective lift support.
B000C5SG9A|5|fit perfect and arrived quickly for my 1998 honda accord. Always by denso oxygen sensors for your honda because they are oem for your car
B0015PI7A4|5|This battery tester works well on a 2000 vw beetle, and I would recommend it. It is easy to use.
B0013CRFD4|1|Purchased these about a month ago and already one bulb has gone bad. Installation is quick and easy, but as other comments mention I wouldn't call this 6000K. Also, durability sucks! Wish there was some way I could get my money back.
B00ZE3WFCE|5|Works great and fit grest
B0009JKI1I|5|Just what we wanted. Fit the car perfectly.
B004J869AE|5|finally matched what was already on my car.
B00068XCQU|5|Great product, works as advertized. The only thing I wish it had was a way to connect it to two or more batteries at the same time.
B00C5RB03W|4|The cables where not included but they do fit snug in the bumper of our travel trailer. We lost our stock caps going down the road
B0048EZWHA|4|Good quality and fit - if you have quad seats.<br />Ours is buckets up front and benches 2nd & 3rd row.<br />Nice naterial cut properly.
B000CNBBQC|5|These are great.  I like being able to have my window down a bit and not have rain drip into the cab.  It took no more than 30 seconds each to install on my 2001 Silverado.  I would recommend them to all interested.
B007HRWNBS|5|This is an RV thermostat for Atwood model furnaces. Took 10 minutes or less to install. Remove old thermostat, writing down which color wires go to which connections, then connect those colors to the corresponding connections on the new thermostat. If your old thermostat has extra colors that are without connections on the new thermostat, just wrap each end with electric tape and tuck away into wall. Also, if the 2 screw holes securing the old thermostat to wall do not match the holes of the new thermostat, just drill 2 new screw holes. Easy! Works great. Just make sure and set the anticipator to 1.0 since by default it was set at 0.1
B00TZF06VO|5|works great
B005G6J3EM|5|Easy to apply, looks great and sticks on very well.
B0083G3AIW|5|matches chairs I have perectly
B0029EZ4H4|2|Product functionality is very weak. The bulbs are difficult to install into headlight bezel, the tabs on the bulb base just don't match the bezel. The color of the bulbs (6000k)did not match. The lite emitting from the bulb twitched of pulsed making it appear the bulb was loose in the socket. Nothing more annoying than your headlights shaking while driving at night. Still jumping through hoops with the supplier to get them returned. BTW Amazon sent these from a vendor other than the one listed in the link. The 9005s came from one vendor and these H11s came from another.
B004W98BWO|4|mounted on a silver b5 passat with black wheels and blacked out rear badge, a combination I think looks great<br /><br />I was concerned they would look cheap, but they look fine<br /><br />fit is perfect<br /><br />quality is good  (though I've only had them a few weeks)<br /><br />would buy again (assuming they last at least a few years)
B0065SJN8Q|5|Excellent Quality.  It is a very detailed image on thick gauge steel.  I recommend this plate or similar ones by this company.
B001OAASTI|5|I ordered this part for my 2012 FLHX Street Glide. The part fit nicely , was shipped quickly and was just what I needed for my bike.
B000CP8F3W|1|Based of Amazon suggestion, I ordered both the Towpower Ball Mount #21278 and the Ball.  For unknown reason the Ball Mount had a 1\\" hole and the Ball a 3/4 \\" stud ....I would have ecpected much better from Amazon.  Leaves one to wonder.
B001U8UUWE|5|I'm really happy with these seat covers. They look and feel nice and clean easily. The only problem I had was getting the bench seat to fit properly since I can not take out my seat. It still looks good, I just have to adjust it every now and then. They were actually very easy to install and I did it myself. It only took maybe 30 minutes. I've had several compliments on them and am overall pleased. By the way, I have a Chevy HHR if that helps.
B00546C8UA|5|I just got a Rav4 and bought this cargo net to help adjust to not having a trunk for the first time. I already love it. It clips in easily, doesn't take up much room when it's taken down, and holds a lot of items in the hammock. It keeps everything right inside the door, which makes it perfect for grocery trips. Highly recommend it!
B0006HMC8K|5|awesome product. me likey.
B00QUTGDEC|5|I believe these floor liners are well worth the price.  High degree of protection and a perfect fit.
B001RMT5Q0|2|The passenger light was a poor fit as to be expected after reading the other reviews.  The wiring on the driver light did not work.  First the light would not come on until it was knocked on then the blinker would not work.  I had to take the wiring off of the old light to get it to work.<br /><br />These lights are definitely brighter then the old ones which still made it worth it.
B004I1F5TI|1|does not work, if you decide to purchase the headlight, check it when it arrives. Unfortunately , I waited to install and test light  for  2 months , and now Amazon will not take it back. I ordered the light , because it was the cheapest one I found on line , I now know why it is the cheapest.The light is the right model and fit for my car, but the internal wiring in the headlamp is defective.
B0007VF9XK|5|This Westin Bumper Mount Kit fit my bumper perfectly and I am extremely satisfied with it and would recommend it to anyone.
B004PQNH78|5|Well made and look great
B001UJGUR2|4|I got these to protect my back seats of my truck. They work great. I didn't know how to thread the buckles, and it is a requirement. I experimented with several configurations, and I think I got the correct one. It is hard to buckle the upright seat if your arm/hands are large. My a normal size, so it was easier. I didn't have any instructions to tell me what to do with the loops at the sides of each bottom seat cover. I tried threading the strap with the buckle through them. It seems to hold them tight. I think they will do a great job of protecting the seats from the dirty/muddy passengers; they have the added benefit of making my seats a lighter color. I have black seats which are hot in the Houston summers.<br />I had the same brand with my previous truck, and it gave me years of services. I actually recycled them by selling them to a person to use on their truck. I believe they are working well for them, also.
B004E2E6NC|4|I had this unit installed for about a month when battery on car went dead and mirrior blinked a couple times and just never came back on. It comes with 3 year warranty and American Security Company sent me a replacement right out as soon as I returned it. Thanks American Security Company.
B000CMF5ME|5|This valve stem mount worked absolutely perfect in conjunction with the inflator head that I purchased with it.  Shipping was very quick.  Price was very fair.
B00AA1KGAI|1|I would give it a negative star if I could. I got this for my boyfriend for his pickup and it has no instructions. So he went to a place to have it installed and they said it would cost $300.
B00URR4O5I|1|I received it but have not installed due to it being the wrong product. Due to the application I was supposed to use it on I really needed the shiny silver foil backed product as in the pictures and the description on the product. Noico also advertises a black foil self adhesive. I specifically ordered this product for a reason and instead received their other product.
B00236B84G|2|Looks great! The rear license plate holder is too small to fit my 2012 Suburban. The front holder is fine.  Really wanted a matching set. : ( Remember to check the size by measuring the molded tag area for your vehicle before purchasing.
B0075JYPNM|4|Looks great!
B004GCC1Z0|2|This Bumper does not fit my chevy suv.<br />This bumper is for s-10 pick-up trucks. you guy did not gave me more imformation on this bumper.<br />This bumper does not have slot  for my valance  the bottom part that goes on my suv.
B0096129I0|4|The rim stripes were of good quality and look good but, I did not end up using them on my vehicle.
B000DZFMUA|5|My family and I, 5 of us, like to head to the beach for the summer.  We only own sedans, which makes hauling boogie boards and beach chairs for everyone a bit difficult.  Using this carrier along with a \\"car roof bag\\" solved the problem.  It keeps items off the roof and allows us to bring all of our beach stuff along.  It is sturdy and stays in place relatively well.  It made a 900 mile round trip without any problems.  A previous roof top carrier I owned had one of the legs snap during a trip and scratched up the roof of my car.  For some reason it had a flex joint in the legs.  The legs on this one is solid and very thick and strong.
B0024ECCJW|5|I live in a 33 ft. Fifth Wheel it is a Beautiful Unit, feeling like a one bedroom Apt. However taking a shower/bath was a nightmare. This unit was fitted with a 6 gallon propane tank only. I spent 6 mons. doing research and not feeling very clean, sometimes having to bath twice in a day. The other Units I ran into, to revise or enchance my system seemed costly and extensive to put in. However when I ran into this Camco Hybrid RV Hot water Heater and did research on it. Well simply it seem my dreams came true. And it has. It is simple, very well explained instructions and works Wonderful. On first shower/bath...I was in heaven and felt clean when done...and still didn't run out of hot water. Then I even wash clothes after that. I love it. Oh...did I mention the price is so reasonable. At the time that I purchased this I even got free shipping and it came extremely fast. Way before the time promised to arrive. Thank you Amazon for providing this product in such a manner.
B002GIQV1Q|5|If you don't have one of these for your F1 50, you should get one, it fits under my backseat like a dream and I don't have items rolling all over the floor.
B002YKMD3G|5|Opening the packaging was a pleasant experience.  Engraved on the front was LANG USA.  Which was nice to see.  This is an all metal tool that will last, supposing that you'll need to adjust many Ford headlights.  It adjusted the headlights on my 99 Grand Marquis just fine.  Now I have headlights that are adjusted properly.  I am satisfied with this product.
B0073WGPMA|5|Arrived fast & works perfect. Much cheaper than oem.
B00JDK99IW|5|PERFECT FIT AND EASY TO INSTALL. 2003 YAMAHA R6
B0054YCW62|5|The net works great I have  used it several times to keep items from flying out of my truck when I am going down the freeway .  I use a tarp under it makes a very secure load.
B00065JTD8|1|I purchased this compass, but what a huge disappointment!!Don't waste your money, it never worked, impossible to calibrate!! constantly gave false reading!! I took it off my vehicle dash. Again, compass is useless, would not reccomend it to no one!!
B000CNJNWG|5|Super easy to install, cuts down on wind noise, allows some venting in the rain, an even keeps a little extra sun out of the cab.
B00KQSM7VG|1|Part did not work on 2009 rhino 700
B000NLX0WG|5|Great truck cover!! Put it on in about 30 min, used a little silicone around the edge for an extra seal and proceeded to drive the next day from Virginia to San Francisco to Bellingham WA. and back without the slightest problem in below freezing temps and high winds.
B009OPRKNM|5|Love it. True to listing. Thanks.
B009FNX6SQ|5|It came fast, was concerned as when I open it and read the instruction to install, that it read for 2013, I email the company would this fit my 2014 crew cab frontier, and they reply very fast back to me that it would and they didn't update their pamphlet. It took my uncle and myself about an hour to installed. It went smoothly and looks awesome. What I really like is, when I order the running boards, if you pick the wrong size the software on amazon will not allow you to order according to the truck you enter that your buying accessories for. Thank you for that, it help me to  make sure I was ordering the correct size product for my truck.
B00J4OI9VU|4|Work like a charm,I Add in the pieces JB Weid to insure it stay together.
B0039KXOZ6|5|Mats make the car looking much better.  Decent quality although I thought they might be thicker/heavier.  But no issues .. would buy again.
B00JUQFVX6|5|Great product. It fit well and stay sturdy in our car.
B000UOC446|5|Took it to a local locksmith and had it cut, then program the new key in my Ford Explorer Limited 2003 and that was all I had to do..
B006WPQNB2|5|Excellent camp potty. Im a newbie to camping and this made my first trip tolerable. We only used it for #1
B009WQ3JFQ|5|These floor liners were the perfect choice for my 2009 Dodge Ram 1500 Big Horn Crew Cab.  I am very picky about keeping my truck clean, and every winter the carpeting got wet with the heavy duty Dodge floor mats I was using.  The Husky Liners will definitely keep the winter mess in my truck contained.  They also look great.
B00BGAS6YU|2|Depth of field inadequate.  The mirror should be slightly curved to give you a broader and more complete view of what's behind.
B00DUUYNW8|5|THe dealer wanted THREE HUNDRED dollars for this part. This one worked just fine. Also, for anyone with a Nissan Xterra, don't take your car apart to put this in, go on you tube for the relocation hack. I did it in about an hour, and I worked slowly. Beats the heck out of taking the intake manifold off the car to change this thing. Buy the harness too, makes it sooooooooooooo easy, and you get it done for about 15 bucks and your time.
B0002KKIUK|5|Very good product last about 3 1/2 months in Tennessee
B00BTLEHSK|3|Not quite what I expected. Difficult fit on my 2009 Prius. Instructions direct you to a YouTube channel. Why waste the paper? Or just give me the damn instructions. Regardless with more time and effort on my part to make it fit correctly I get compliments on them often. A few tears here and there after about 500 mi or so of driving and the crease in the back/base of the seat often pushes up or wrinkles.<br /><br />&#34;A&#34; for design & aesthetics<br />&#34;C&#34; for installation<br />&#34;B&#34; for durability
B000ZBHTAI|5|Its a great wax.  I used the blue cap verstion of this brand and its fantastic.  The shine is remarkable.  Thats what prompted me to buy the more expensive version.  Excellent but if you are looking for the smooth finish on your car after applied in layers; you're going to be disappointed.  The finish is fantastic but the feel is a little gritty for some odd reason.
B004MDIYOK|5|I bought this, not because of the Brand name which, being new to Jeep Wranglers, I am unaware of. I bought it because of the great YouTube video that made the installation simple and easy. Using the front bumper to loop a line tied to either end of the hitch,  I lifted the hitch into place with the help of  a Game Hoist, tied-off to another vehicle, it made a one person installation a snap in under two hours. A floor jack made fine tuning the fit simple. It fit like a glove.
B008GVBM70|5|Amazing ny cheaply made works great.
B003YCEN6I|2|I bought these towels for cleaning purposes, based on my research they're supposed to be lint free but they're not.I'm not sure what to use them for now as they don't work for the intended purpose.
B0002RNSNM|5|Cheaper than other options, I cut the wire to replace a defective trailer end.  Arrived quickly and undamaged. Would buy this again next time I need half, the price was right!
B0038AV8HS|4|I would give these headlights 5 of 5 stars had they provided some instructions with them. The only documentation, at all in the box, was a disclaimer that condensation does not mean they are leaking water. Luckily, I found an instructional video for another brand of halo headlights, on how to identify and patch into the correct wires on the factory wiring harness to get your halos set to use the existing parking light voltage. Outside of that, I have had no complaints. I get lots of extra long looks, from pedestrians, other drivers, mechanics, etc  - as well as lots of compliments about how great they make my truck look.
B00DMTT9GC|5|I purchased the amazon warehouse deal husky liner weather beater for my 2014 Sierra. As I have in the passed. No damages not used looks brand new. For this product since it's plastic/rubber like material and it's so larger. It does not take shape right away because it comes folded in the box. Simple fix. Since its cold I took my blow dryer to the area where it was folded and the areas that didn't sit right on the contours and it fit great just like the front mats I purchased. I really like how they cover all the under the back seat. Be aware there are two versions. This one and a shorter one that does not cover under the seat. I would definitely keep buying this product. Never had any issues. Way better price than the weather techs I found online.
B001KOZVY0|5|love it! Nice quality leather.
B0050IRYRY|5|I bought this for my son, and helped him put it on.  Very easy installation.<br />Bike looks great with the new fender.
B00369APAC|5|Bought it to replace my original Vega Bluetooth charger after I misplaced it.
B000IXSF7O|5|This is perfect it doesn't move around on the steering wheel it stays n place and looks great. The color on tweety is staring to fade a little from the sun but that is to be expected.
B000E4NRKC|4|I ordere this part for my car it came<br />In the mail during  the holiday season super speedy . My friend is a mechanic and in stalled it in five mins it was awsome!  Thanks amazon!
B0002X520S|4|Works.  Less expensive products that work equally well.
B000TYOS3C|3|It fits where the original piece was. But it does not fit any more securely than the original so I may have to buy another if I forget to check the ground after lowering the tail gate.
B001HQCPGI|5|This adjustable regulator works better than i expected it too, 5 stars all the way to Accel by me again
B00BJHS6TA|5|works great. still have ice after 24 hours+. Easier to use if you also buy &#34;Hydro Flask Wide Mouth Flip Lid, Black&#34;
B0031BG5NG|5|Easy to install. Good quality. Make sure you get wheel spacers too. Quad gets a little tippy otherwise very good
B009L0EE48|1|Bought this item had it installed by a suzuki shop. I was immediately told the chain is defective. They walked me thru the areas of concern.  The chain was acting as if it had kinks even though there weren't any present.  It was very tight and when loosened it had spots that were way to loose.  When tightened it was way too tight.  Wouldn't get that tight loose tight feel that should have. Was advised that riding on this chain is unsafe as I it could break and if riding at a speed over 45mph could cause death or serious injuries.  Now I'm stuck having to purchase another chain pay to have it installed again.  So that's 2 installed chains plus a new chain.  So I'm out an additional $450 bucks.
B005QPPSG0|5|Awesome thanks for the freebie
B0058J4Y4Q|5|These tail lights are awesome.  They are dark and at the same time very legal.  They do not limit any light are very bright.  They look a lot better than the factory tail lights in my opinion.
B001K9JO5C|5|Amazing!!!!! These VW BEETLE hubcaps are exactly as described. BRAND SPANKING NEW. super easy to place on.  Had to replace two of them on my wife's car. My wife is extremely happy and these made her enjoy her car again.  Also, the item arrived 4 days earlier than estimated.  I will definitely order again if she needs something else for her car.  Thanks and great Job.
B00BYTSHIS|5|Bulb is not quite as bright as incandescent, but at night illuminates door well.  Be sure space is available for extra length bulb.  Has slight blue tint but not overly blue.
B009KAT3BI|4|Great switch set up fit nicely in my crown Vic everything wired up easily only thing I had to do was change the name over each switch
B000KFWVN4|5|I used it on my Motorhome and it did a great job. Absolutely no spots which is what I was looking for.
B001AY2WLU|4|i have not had a chance to use this much, but it worked well as a screw driver when i needed it!
B001RZA4LC|5|very easy install, 5 minute deal. strong as heck and way better than honda option.  it is a fourwheeler and not a truck
B0006MTRJ2|5|Very durable hose despite lightweight feel.  No leaking at either end.  I leave the hose outside all day and it has been able to withstand the bright California sun for several months now.
B0036CVFJ4|5|Had this on my truck for over 2 years now. no complaints. I use it all the time, and it hasn't even shown any signs of wear.
B003WDDLTO|5|Was exactly what I needed to replace the old ones that got burned of against the harley pipes.
B004RNOW64|4|it came fast and works great far price
B002T4PTG0|5|These installed straightforward with all the necessary hardware included.  The ride is smooth but much sportier than stock, especially when the suspension is loaded.
B004YJ08GO|5|I drive a mid-2000's Hyundai, and those seemed to have disintegrating steering wheels.  A steering wheel cover is a must.<br /><br />My last unit (all leather) wore through after years of service.  I replaced it with this one.  It's comfortable, good looking (if that matters to you), and overall a decent value.<br /><br />Installation takes a little patience, as it fits very tightly.  Then again, anything less snug would be a safety issue.  Simply begin at one spot, and slowly pull it over the wheel a bit at a time.
B003D5IXS0|3|I've owned many different sets of PIAA driving and fog lights over the years and this pair just does not provide the level of illumination I expected. The build quality is high and installation is easy.
B00JV765NY|5|Used these as my reverse lights in my 04 silverado and i love the look, super bright and looks great with my taillight bar!
B00BIFTY26|3|Hooked these up to my reverse lights on my 2001 Tacoma although I am dissapointed with the light output. The seller states that they are 9 watts each, but they are no where near that probably around 3 watts each. I give these 3 stars because even though there not that bright they still outshine my reverse bulbs.
B00FC220JK|5|Works well still after 2 months. Used in my budget retrofit project on my jeep. Seems good quality for the price. 4300k gives off good color and looks good. Time will tell but so far so good.
B004R2Y64S|4|Very satisfied with the final product.  Solid and looks great (on Mazda 5).  As other reviewer have stated the bolts that attach to the existing mount points in the Mazda 5 are indeed to long and you cannot fully tighten it down (only 1-2 Millimeters but it makes a diff).  Rola should get on that and kept if from five stars.  Others have cut the bolt - I simply cut out some bicycle inner tube pieces to use as shims between car and mounts extending the length.  Worked great and is supper solid.<br /><br />Took me an hour to install but I could do it over again in 20 min.
B005FL27QY|5|Very good brakes, easy to install.  I had problems with packaging as parts were missing but the product is excellent.
B00839WV4I|5|Need a replacement fog lamp bulb and the parts store prices are through the roof. These work fantastic and I would recommend this to everyone considering its purchase.
B00199BO4C|4|Works well
B00JHEG81A|5|Awesome product got it 4 days early which is even better! Very bright and simple set up even if you don't know anything about cars you can DIY. Definitatly makes you stand out!
B000VKOD9S|5|Fit my 2011 Honda CR-V EX-L with Navi AWD perfect.  The installation was very easy and took about 3 minutes.
B003U1NPBW|5|Great gift loved them great  they are now on my daughters car really cool and easy to apply so great
B00C7Y6GBE|5|perfect
B007ETJGQO|5|Works good fits with no modifications in my 14 patriot
B0002Z9R16|4|A good value.  Satisfied.  Prompt service.
B0002SRDUU|5|I have used heli-coil in the past with good results. Easily repairing a stripped thread.
B00FMWCI9W|5|Happy, happy....
B0007W1JUQ|5|I have made several purchases through TrueFlow.com, and they truly offer a great product. I have never had any issues, and they offer great customer service. Worth the money!
B000CB7DNO|5|Fit my cat perfectly couldn't ask for a better fit.
B001GJ3DZS|5|This appeared to be a very nice item, however the item ordered with it was damaged, so following the instructions I returned it with the complete order. This was a mistake, because by doing so over $4.00 was deducted from the refund. If this is not corrected, I will not make any more purchases. THE ERROR HAS BEEN CORRECTED AND I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE ATTENTION GIVEN TO IT.
B000765E08|5|It took me a total of 20 minutes to install this hitch. The instructions were easy to understand and the hardware was complete.
B000EBKG90|3|they are great but I really needed the next size up!
B000BRQ0TW|1|put it at the bottom of some indoor pots and they all leak. :(
B00030BFQA|5|great charger
B004PKC2M0|5|I drive a POS commuter car. But ever since slapping this decal on I feel like my commute is a race track and I am being featured on Top Gear. I find myself wearing a fullfaced helmet often also.<br /><br />Don't get this decal if you don't like helmet hair.
B009774GCA|5|Great inexpensive crank case breather, using it for my OBA set up
B000CMH7YS|5|Great looking and a better price then other brands but just like those other brands it says the name on top of it. Lame!
B00D1SWWGS|1|The description stated a large size fitting 15.5 and 16.5 steering wheel diameter but was only 14.5 to 15.5 when received. The cover ripped in half when trying to install. Waste of money!
B004ZC3TFC|5|When I wasn't getting out between hip replacements, I was puzzled by my van not starting when needed.  Then I learned that today's electronics slowly drain the battery, and when the vehicle is not being driven regularly to recharge the battery, it will drain the charge.  I ordered this solar charger and plugged it in, and the problems of a dead battery ended.  When I needed to get to the doctor, the van started right up.  That trickle charge solves the problem of a vehicle not driven regularly just beautifully.
B001EOV46K|4|Heavy rubber and nice looking. Only drawback is, someone stoled it.
B000C2Y5IY|5|Gates make a durable coolant hose that is high quality and either meets or is the same as the hose that came off your vehicle. I have used them on all three of my cars and they fit perfect.
B00KZD8JV4|5|Great product! Beatiful pieces.
B004RPJWHQ|1|Cute, but quickly corrodes and won't come off without damaging your tire valve stems. Not worth it. Choose higher quality elsewhere.
B0013FWACW|5|perfect fit & function
B00EZUL6ZY|4|Awesome
B000SDVEU4|5|Just purchased this item to replace another boot that was defeated. We hope this club tire claw can prevent our trailer from being stole.
B00BGZ044K|5|I drop my keys all the time as I am in and out of the car all day for work.  It provides great protection and people always ask me where I got it!
B001FI06MS|4|had to angle cut one end but good
B008KZK69M|5|Great fit and quality
B003RQBKLC|2|I bought this unit specifically because of the 2 usb charging ports, but when I got it was disappointed to find out it wouldn't charge my ipod.  I could still charge it using the cigarette lighter socket as I always have, but the reason I bought this device was to use the usb ports.<br /><br />The current generation of ipods, ipads, iphones, etc. will not charge from the usb ports on this device as delivered.  The problem is that the device must see about 2 volts on the data pins.  To achieve this, first see the excellent pictures and instructions left by Berbician Nomad in the pictures section.  This is step 1 (by the way, you don't have to short both pairs of pins--they're in parallel so shorting one pair effectively shorts both pair).  I did this to mine, but unfortunately it wasn't enough.  My ipod still wouldn't charge from the usb port.<br /><br />The next thing you need to do is add a pair of resistors.  You will need a 22k ohm resistor and a 12k ohm resistor.  Referencing Berbician Nomad's 2nd picture, look at the center square.  There are 2 sets of 4 pins, the pins laid out horizontally and the sets arranged vertically.  We'll designate the leftmost pin to be pin 1.  As stated before, once you've shorted one pair of center pins, you can consider all 4 center pins to be the same pin.  Connect a 22k ohm resistor from pin1 to pins 2/3.  Connect a 12k resistor from pin 4 to pins 2/3.  Use 1/8 watt resistors if you can find them.  You can use 1/4 or even 1/2 watt resistors but the smaller 1/8 watt resistors are easier to cram in.  Note that you need to do this to only one set of pins.  As stated, since they're in parallel, modding one set automatically does both sets.  It might, for instance, be easier in terms of space to put one resistor on the upper set and the other on the lower set.  Once done, usb ports will then charge your ipod.<br /><br />On my first attempt at this, I used equal value resistors (both 22k) and the voltage at the data pins came to 2.45 volts (half the 5 volt supply as you would expect), but it turned out to be too high.  It needs to be down around 2.0 to 2.1 volts, hence the 12k resistor on the ground side.<br /><br />This is an easy mod, but I would recommend that if you don't have experience soldering electronics, find a friend who does.<br /><br />The reason I gave it 2 stars is because, as delivered, the unit will not charge some of the most common devices on the market.  Why did it have to be modded?  Why didn't it come that way already?
B00BV6YRYM|5|I appreciate the quality provided and I would definitely purchase from them again.
B005CKFYEU|3|I bought this sunshade for my 2012 Fiat 500C..  I think it works great, keeps  the car cooler, even here in Southern Arizona, but it is a bit of a bother to roll up and store.  As the other poster said, there's not a lot of room in a Fiat and it would be great if it was more like a thin thermal blanket.
B002UC4TFI|5|The OEM bracket got bent and never stayed put.  This replacement works great.  It is much stronger in construction and seems like it is going to stay put.  The price through amazon killed what the dealer wanted.  Plus I got it shipped to my door and didn't have to drive 20 miles to the dealer.
B00I3JWJV8|1|They hardly give off any scent
B00F912UYO|4|Nice cover.
B00IUC8V4W|4|Good stuff. Works great.
B004ETGQKG|3|It helps with my morning's by keeping the frost off the glass. Gotta save all precious minutes in the mornings! I was disappointed though that it tore on the part where I put it in the door just after two uses.<br /><br />The material is thin and the quality is typical inexpensive material. I hope it lasts through the winter.
B004I7M6G2|5|Great Product, Shipped Fast
B00PGI1D52|4|Easy to install, adds a nice accent as well as a little more comforts
B000LVXOBA|1|I have not received the shipment yet<br />I have not received the shipment yet<br />I have not received the shipment yet<br />I have not received the shipment yet
B005THRC46|5|OEM part which arrived very quickly.
B00I62XFF6|5|If you dont have this on your front plate mount, you are jeeping wrong.
B00QWNZDI8|1|RECIEVED PUMP AND FOUND FUEL IN THE BOX IT WAS SHIPPED IN.  I FIGURED THAT IT WAS FROM TESTING THE PUMP AT THE MANUFACTURING FACILITY. UPON INSTALLATION THE PUMP PROCEEDED TO HEAT UP.  I AM IPC CERTIFIED AND A ROBOTICS ENGINEER SO I DISASSEMBLED THE PUMP TO FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. I FOUND A BAD GROUND CRIMP.  THE WIRE WAS NOT EVEN PINCHED INTO THE CRIMP.  SOLDERED THE CRIMP TO THE WIRE AND REASSEMBLED  THE PUMP.  THE BAD GROUND TO BEGIN WITH TOASTED THE PUMP. NONFUNCTIONAL.... WASTE OF $80. WASTE OF TIME.
B000C19DNM|5|After sending me the correct part for my truck it was easy to install .
B000EH4V0Y|5|This great tool to have in your shop, I used it to fill my differential box and my transmission oil. You can lock the tube to stop dispensing anytime you wish and has a lid for additional coverage against dust and dirt. Money well spent!
B002N5J7YA|5|.....quality than what I was using.  Sturdier, and more flexible than the Camco offerings of similar price.  Would definitely purchase again.
B00EB8FNEK|5|This mirror was exactly the same as the old one and it fit perfectly except that the attached bolts were a little short and it was difficult to install the nuts without help from another person.  In addition it would be helpful if an extra nut came with the kit because it is very easy to lose one of the nuts while trying to install the mirror.
B006VY4DYI|4|The factory battery was no longer holding charge much and Toyota wants $350 for theirs and the work to swap it is $140.  It look roughly under an hour to swap out this Optima.  The new one is a little bit narrower but it's fine.  The battery bracket is able to secure it tightly.  Now, startups are a lot quicker and no worries that my battery needs a jump.
B00327B8P4|5|i bought this floor mat for my wife's 2004 sienna and it fits perfectly, so i'm buying the same for my mum's 2005 sienna. will surely recommend it.
B00CO8UFHO|5|Everything we needed we there, it was great.  Was a lifesaver, as the Garmin we received had a charger cord that did not fit the Garmin we ordered.
B009EV0ZPQ|2|This item will only fit the passenger side of a 1986 corvette. This blade sits too high for the drivers side that has to go below the hood.
B000CQ6C9K|5|Good quality, looks great in my car and protects the carpet. I highly recommend these mats and the price is right.Great buy!!!
B004W5TJME|4|i bought it for my f150 truck and fitted nicely excellent price and good durability for a set of tail lights
B000GU0TBY|5|Nice parts
B00AJTG3N0|3|So far this product has meet all expectations but it has only been a few weeks and only time will tell if it it is a long term solution.
B000TK1TRY|5|If you want to see a vast improvement over the stock light this is the item that will get the job done! You will be more than satisfied and it just may save you from a rear-end hit.ALSO VERY VERY EASY to install,takes no longer than changing the bulb,it is \\"plug n play\\"
B0043S0T0G|5|Just what we needed, and half the price of our local mobile home parts store. Arrived very quickly. I would recommend.
B003ZWCAXU|5|The grip on one of the rear door handles of my 2001 Toyota Corolla broke off. AutoHalo was the only store on the Web offering to sell a replacement for that one handle. All of the others sold only sets of four handles. I went with AutoHalo. The part arrived promptly, is of good quality, and fit perfectly. It took about an hour to install the new part.
B0009IBJAS|5|Small, very light weight, this is strickly a trickle charger. Took almost 24 hours to charge up my Optima Gell cell battery. I bought this due to the gell cells does not like to sit for days not being charged. This lights up yellow when its charging and turns green when battery is fully charged. Battery is always ready to go now when I need it.
B008ZZ1N5I|1|Does not work at all. Product said it was for make and model car. Seems to be very difficult finding LEDS that actually work.
B00M0QD8T2|5|Love my silverado sticker. Fast shipping, good quality. Will order from theses guys again :)
B007P4IUJW|1|Real  crap can be cut with wire cutters. totally useless Might work if you want to keep thing secure from 1-3 year old kids.
B00267PXOS|2|Seat size is way too small for any adult.  Spend a little more for a larger seat. One two three.
B002X54SDK|5|Look great and look like the factory wording.  The package was here quick and easy to put on. I would buy these again.
B001C5MEZ6|5|i use on bike in woods fishing in april or hunting or cold days wrks good thx came quick u guys are the best thx again.
B000VNEJOE|5|I thought l would try my hand at repairing the front bumper cover on my son's Civic. This material was used with a new plastic welding unit l had never used.  The material welded the bumper very well, and l refinished the panel and painted it. It exceeded my expectations, and l wound up fixing several items in my  shop and house.  Great product.
B00TQ4INN2|5|Truck spoiler Maserati
B000CD386S|5|Nice complete unit.My shocks pumped up after installation.Bought this as a 'just in case'.
B00029JK8M|5|fast and easy, works great!!!!  would buy again!
B00RGKZ1GA|4|Shipping was actually faster than expected coming from China. Easy install exactly as pictured. I tested them after install won't really know how long they will hold up over the long run, but I like them for the price.
B004J2V0ZO|1|Item not good, just lights up like a toy and never worked, would not recommend, cheap packing, bad instructions, what is there left to say?
B00N5CMTAE|5|AWESOME!!!!!!! LOOKS GREAT AND SAVES THE TATAS!
B0049MRJ9U|5|fit my 2011 rav4 perfect
B0023VB8T6|5|This is an aftermarket part for a 20 year old car, however it fits perfectly and looks great.
B00RCLL2UC|5|nice!!
B000AP57OO|5|This is a must buy product for your car. Not only does it help your car breath better it is reusable for lifetime.
B000C71HU8|4|Always a good idea to change these when changing pads/shoes.
B000FUNZF2|5|Really good rust preservation!!!!
B003KI6QVQ|5|Product came very fast and looked better than I expected. Adds a nice look to my car and I would defiantly recommend it to anyone.
B005OVK3H0|5|I had an error code come up on my girlfriends car and said one of the things that could correct the issue would be to replace this part . After checking on Ebay to see who had the better price it was on here for Hundreds less . I installed this over 5 months ago and working great and no error codes on car .
B009M1VO6C|3|When I got the lights, one of the four didn't work, and after a few weeks I couldn't get them to turn on anymore. But while it lasted it did light up my camaro really bright.
B009OBVRY4|5|I was a little skeptical about purchasing this product at first, so I did not purchase from Amazon. I was worried that I would not like it and then have to send it back.  So I purchased from ***-Mart, for a little more, but wanted the convenience of returning it.<br /><br />Wow, this thing works. It works exactly as advertised. If you are like me, and when you purchase something you simply want it to work as advertised, then you will be very happy with this tool.<br /><br />I have a 9 year old GMC truck, with bumper scratches from getting to close to the wall going in the garage, 5 years of washing and trying to get the scratches off manually did not work, but with this tool and some scratch X it came right off.  Now granted it too some time and a couple of applications, but it did the job.<br /><br />And, do no try to be a macho man or woman and use this with your $200 fancy cordless drill, you must have a corded drill, remember you need the RPMS not the torque.  I had a very old corded drill with a variable speed trigger and a variable speed dial, meaning I could set the dial to medium speed and no matter how far I pressed the trigger it would only go to medium speed.<br /><br />And I used all three of the sponges (compound, polish, and wax), these things are heavy duty.  I have other hand buffers and the sponges \ bonnets and typically after one vehicle they start to tear, because I hit a corner or a piece of plastic.  The Meguiar pads held up nicely.<br /><br />The only con of this tool is hand fatigued, and this could be my drill, the vibrations really get to your hand after a few minutes. Again, it is probably my drill, it may be worth it to purchase a corded drill that is more comfortable.
B00L84EKI0|5|Worked Great for my 2013 6 Cyl Highlander.
B001QGFWNM|5|just like factory. works great
B003ECULUU|1|The whole setup is great, but the plastic is to light and does not screen out the sun enough, especially in the evening going west.<br />I wish somebody would make it with UV dark plastic
B00E9E5GSE|1|It did'nt help improve the reception
B000FQ7CQO|1|I ordered these fenders for my 1999 Wrangler Sport to replace the original fenders after a paint job.  When the body shop attempted to install them, they were too long and would have required the plastic to be buckled in order to make the mounting holes line up, which would have looked bad and cracked the plastic after a while.  According to the Jeep dealership, there are two different models of fender for that year and obviously these are not for my particular Wrangler.  Be careful when you order.
B00HFJL1O8|5|Put 10,000 miles on them already. No single problem so far!
B000GU3K7Y|3|Does it's job
B00D1CQVIY|5|Good harness, works well
B0034ZHTPC|5|very nice
B00K7HPFFQ|5|It worked well when plugged into my vehicle.
B002Z5RZS8|5|Very nice quality came with everything I needed to install them.  It only took five minutes to install them! They look just like a set of wheels for a fraction of the cost.
B004YEJDME|5|Good
B0048DYY1G|4|fits good on the dash
B00AZQ006I|4|very good
B005EVARDK|1|Purchased this product because I have had another Bulldog remote starter that has worked fine for over three years. What a mistake, this unit arrived on time and I installed it in my '99 Suburban. Hit the remote buttons and nothing, went over all wiring, all hooked up correctly. E-mailed tech support and went through all of their different troubleshooting and reset procedures, nothing worked. Sent unit back to Amazon and got replacement, figured just got a bad unit. Installed replacement and exactly the same problem, remotes do not work. Went through all the troubleshooting again, nothing. Bulldog's answer at this point was get an RMA# and send the unit to them at my expense. This one is being returned and I will buy another brand with better reviews.
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Works well for me.  I go to a park regularly and the fact that this is thick and stiff means it stays flat even on somewhat rough ground.  Nicer to lie on than a thin plastic sheet.  Colors are attractive.
B001U04MHG|5|I use this everyday with my handyman service, I also have several at the house for my<br />earthquake kit. The best light for the money.
B0040M4LRC|5|Showed up on time and was what I thought it was going to be.  No problems on fitting on the truck.
B00684TD6O|5|Received it with new batteries included.  The guide for set up was easy to use.  I had it ready to go in under a minute.  Also programs the trunk release which was a +.  Range is a little short but the whole point was for me to be able to unlock my car with ease.  Would certainly recommend this to anyone, don't spend 50.00+ for some key shop to do it for you.
B0023VERVC|5|Item fit like a glove.  No difference between it and a honda item.  Just doesnt say Honda.  So honestly why pay three times the price for the same exact item that works just fine.  No problems with the screw holes ligning up or anything.  The light socket was exactly right too.  Need help getting that entire bumper off?  Send me a comment and i can help you thru the process.  It really isnt that hard to do the job!
B000VU97TO|5|was very good thanks.
B0029EXC82|1|I purchased this item in December and installed them and right away both lights started flickering. I emailed the seller to advise them of the defect and to request a replacement in January and to this day in April have yet to receive a single item for replacement.  I've tried and tried to get some replacement component, ANY COMPONENT and I don't know if there was a language barrier or if the seller was playing dumb and refused to understand what I was trying to say and simply didn't want to send me the defective components. I initially wanted them to send me another replacement kit but they insisted that I identify the faulty component. Well, as both sides are defective and flickering and I do not have spare ballasts or bulbs, I am unable to diagnose as they have asked. I have asked them to tell me how to isolate the defective component so that I can have them send whatever component is defective and have received absolutely no assistance. I have nearly TWO DOZEN emails explaining and asking what I need to do to get some sort of replacement. In February they said they were mailing out some components to me and I received nothing for weeks. I then emailed them to find out what the status was for the replacements they were shipping and I got no where. They have now completely stopped responding to my emails. My experience with the seller was and continues to be uber frustrating and extremely disappointing. I completely understand that some products are defective and I am simply asking that the seller stand behind his product and give me what I have paid for but the attitude and sheer disregard is unbelievable and quite unethical. Sadly, and it's completely my fault, I should have engaged Amazon customer service to resolve this right away but as I was dealing directly with the seller and it always seemed like I was just on the verge of getting somewhere with the seller, I figured I would rather not tarnish their rating but instead shot myself in the foot and let the amazon dispute period slip away so I no longer have any recourse other than to deal with these people directly and hope that somehow they do what is right. Not holding my breath though.
B003VZXY4K|2|This product is ok. It doesn't connect into the fuse compartment right in keeping the fuse door closed. I disconnected it because it kept killing my truck when I didn't want it to.
B000C55LXE|5|I put these on my 05 Silverado regular cab long bed HD that replaced oem shocks with 100k on them. The new Monroe 37150 were the right choice for me. I mainly use my truck for commuting,  so I wanted a good ride. These shocks ride very nice and are much more stable than the stock HD shocks that came on the truck.
B004ULDMB4|3|no instructions on how to mount on to rims and clips DO NOT stay on rims. Have to keep reattaching clips to rims
B007PVHVO0|5|The lift supports were exactly what I expected. I was very happy with them
B0019BSGTQ|5|It fit great and looks awesome 99 accord coupe with Blox racing shift knob!! No modifications needed easy installation nice product
B004IU240M|5|Love my chair, I use it inside outside allside. Rocking is smooth. Seat and back seem durable. Very pleased. If I were to nitpick I would ask that they have a lock or better way to keep in folded, if you're not holding it properly it will keep trying to deploy, no biggie.
B0002NYDYO|5|This is a simple, but functional unit. Heavy-duty plastic components fit together well. I checked out a bunch of different bearing packers before deciding on this one. BTW, the Amazon price is much cheaper than what Sears sells it for.
B001TJ3HUG|5|I have tried several cleaners and conditioners that can stand up to the tough wear my sofa receives due to my 3 dogs. This cleaner works very well and keeps the leather soft and supple. Other cleaners smelled terrible or left the sofa oily which made pet hair stick to the couch. It also has no harsh smell, so my leather sofa smells like new. I will continue to purchase this cleaner and conditioner combination.
B000GRS2GG|1|Never really go to try it. Was to be a xxxxl trike cover wouldn't begin to fit my goildwing hannigan trike
B0001EFSTI|1|1. Should be a way to permanently attach to your keychain. Instead, when you open it, it separates itself from said keychain.<br />2. when using the bottle opener, one must grip the knife and saw blade. Safe.<br /><br />The design of this is so poorly thought out. Terrible.
B00TAHW476|5|Great vacuum hose for automotive engine applications.  Used it on my '79 datsun 280zx and it works like a champ.  Price is definitely cheaper than others as well.
B000C2WF0E|5|Worked perfectly on our 2012 Tacoma.<br />Much better and easier to unlock and goes back on quick with out re locking or having to use the key again unlike other makes.<br />Get this one since when locked it just turns without doing anything while others lock up and can be broken with just a pair of pliers.
B000TR6EW2|5|Good product. Have used similar product before (bike shield) which was cut into pre-cut strips. That product was slightly heavier gauge but only slightly so.<br /><br />This product is easy to apply and adheres well. Invisible once applied properly, Should protect the bike frame from stone chips.<br /><br />It can be tricky to apply to curved areas, but just use a razor blade and trim appropriately<br /><br />Excellent product recommended<br /><br />One roll did the entire bike (54cm frame) with none left over
B0096BAQ80|5|Good product and, although &#34;used&#34;, was essentially a new unused radiator at a steal of a price.
B0009RUYI2|5|this fit my stock instrument panel opening on my 67 Camaro easy to install great look I would recommend this product
B008F07OMO|5|It was easy to install and works great. The plastic lid was a bit tricky to snap in to place but got it to work. Fits and closes perfectly
B0023VF7HA|5|Why go to the local auto store and pay way more than you need to. This came in the mail and was installed in minutes. Perfect fit to the car and life moves on. Great light, great price!
B00195PFZU|4|Nicely made and fits my case perfectly. Can wait to sit on it at the airport. Great quality and sturdy.
B009HMJL7U|3|Good
B0007LD3CE|5|Put this in my 2000 jeep XJ and absolutely love it. I also have the Airaid TBS and a home made heat shield and the improvement is amazing. Great sound and even better air flow. Would definitely buy again, but I won't have to because it comes with a lifetime warrantee. Buy it now!
B0006IX7Y2|5|Just as described
B003RYOWH8|5|They fit perfect on my grand prix the headrest covers were a lil to big but made them work, nice soft material worth what i paid :)
B001HQLY74|5|Fits and works as it should.  No problems.
B0046JVPXC|5|They look good in the car. Very good purchase made. She likes them and that is all that matters now.
B007P749ZI|5|Installed it over the weekend, every thing you need. You might want to consider buying a new tensioner, but otherwise, this was perfect for a DIY timing belt change.
B0002SRL20|5|Excellent craftsmanship, works perfectly. Makes inflating items much easier and quicker.
B00T47K604|5|Great
B001PWA0IO|1|Did not Fit my 2011 f150 XLT 5.0  ex-cab . Would not advise ,  read the reviews to make sure it fits your truck.
B00BUGNBNQ|2|They are plenty bright but are aimed way too low. I am young with perfect vision. These are not safe over 50 mph. Wish they could be adjusted. Look great.
B00ABW7U1O|5|Very good
B00D4WLDSE|4|quality product, great value, easy rebate.  would heartily recommend.  Easy installation.  Only problem was wrong nuts in one of the packages, no big deal.
B0027A5CN6|5|Good quality part that performs as well as the original.  The ABS light is now out on the Aveo.  However, a note to those looking to do this job themselves; this sensor was so stuck in the steering knuckle that the axle shaft had to be removed so that the sensor could be broken and pushed through.  I don't know if this because I live in Minnesota, or the fact that it is a cheaply manufactured car, but I do know that this was the most stuck sensor that I have ever replaced.
B00029WRJQ|4|These mirrors install quickly, and have many points of adjustment.<br />I have a jeep JK which has almost perfectly flat doors.<br />I was still able to get the mirrors tight.<br />My only gripe is that the strap that runs down to the bottom edge of the door has a tendancy to vibrate in the wind.  I wonder if it does it less on a typical curved door profile.  I was able to change the speed at which the resonance occured by increasing or reducing strap tension.<br />Overall I pleased with these.  They extend out far eough to really open up the view behind my camper.
B000GVBVUG|5|It does what it says it will do.  and easy to apply.  I am happy happy happy! I would buy again.
B0040AE7WS|5|Cool emblems, just fun , put them anywhere
B002M3FZNA|5|Exactly as described, and perfect for basic needs.  It can be difficult to find a reliable truck tire gauge.  No negative issues to report!
B000CSGWZC|5|Many may say that some plugs improve HP, MPG and responsiveness however unless you're replacing an extremely  worn plug I don't find this to be true. I still believe in purchasing the best plug you can afford simply because they send to wear longer. This is a huge plus on vehicles with hard to reach plugs. NGK plugs have never failed me and some OEM on many bikes i have owned. I would buy again
B00KTHW3MW|4|Unlike the picture here mine did not come with the metal &#34;tree&#34; you see inside the case.  No problem, I took the one from my old case and it works perfectly.
B004J8LR88|2|this product is not what i expected. the decals are incredibly tiny! i was hoping they would be much larger...like in the photo. just an FYI..........
B003CJEE6W|1|The windshield arrived quickly, but I was concerned when the box was smaller than expected. Upon opening the box I discovered that the windshield was not the one pictured in the ad. I ordered a windshield that would cover my grips to protect my hands from road hazards and bad weather. The part that arrived was just big enough to fit between the handlebars, about half the size I expected. I checked the part description on the box and it matched the ad, but the item did not match the image shown. I returned it the next day and had to pay the return shipping. I would have liked to have the measurements of the windshield posted in the ad and have the image match the product, I then could have found the item I wanted and saved the time and shipping costs.
B0009YDQE4|4|I have had these in the car for a short period of time now and have had no problems with them except the front ones move around a lot. But they have kept their color up and dirt does not seem to be hard to clean off them.
B005JZMR2A|4|With two car seats and a booster across the back seat, there wasn't enough room between the car seat and the booster to get a hold of the seat belt.  I thought to myself, what I need is an extension to bring it up higher so my daughter can reach it herself.  Searched and found this - exactly what I was picturing.  Works pretty well.<br /><br />My only change I would make - would be to make it 6\\" instead of 8', the extender is very rigid - I think it's solid metal.  So when the seat belt is pulled tight, the extender comes almost half way across the kids lap - but it still does the job.<br />This of course will depend on your vehicle, booster seat and the size of your child - so this may only be me.
B000EFMU4A|1|First one fell off as I was driving, second one cracked right down the middle, no thanks, this was a total waste of my money!
B007XRCTKM|5|Very useful.  It makes driving more comfortable.  It really helps the neck area.  I am glad to have bought it.
B003ECULUU|3|The straps did not work on the visors in my truck so am using Velcro and is doing very well.<br />The visors are worth the money and effort.
B000IYZGNY|5|Item as described, Works Great. Thank You
B001K2ES3C|2|Great material very strong but the length in the rear is very short..the rear wheel stays exposed. Not perfect \\"FIT\\".
B0002MAANI|2|The description says 900lb working load in one place and 900lb break strength in another. It is obviously the latter, but I apparently didn't read the whole thing and was expecting the former. Very disappointing.
B004ZF3DYG|5|excellent product..
B00GJ1DCMM|5|Grat and perfect fit
B002DOME1E|2|I bought these because I didn't want to use bungie cords and potentially scratch my bike or car. They were relatively inexpensive, so why not? After I got my bike mounted, the straps weren't long enough to secure the wheel from the frame. I can't even use them. I have a 29er hybrid bike with a front shock. I would recommend getting something else if you have anything bigger than a BMX bike.
B0016KFW1U|5|This Titan 2-1/2&#34; Class V square tube receiver is a good fit and I have already used it.  Good quality.
B001V8RWBU|4|works great. would have given it five stars but the description said a manual jack was included. I did not receive one.
B00COYNVKQ|4|I like them.
B003JLDQLM|2|This bag seems of high quality, but the minuscule magnets will not hold it tight on a metal tank.  If you use it, be sure to attach the tether strap.  Just brushing against the bag when mounting the bike caused the tank bag to fall off.<br />If you want this bag, I suggest buying the strap mount version.  I had hoped to use it on a 2011 V Strom, but no luck.
B000JZN0SU|2|Is the beginning of July and blades no longer properly clean the windows and I need to replace them
B002L1NHAQ|5|Enrgado a tiempo y funciona a cabalidad,  un precio adecuado y con una gran calidad de acabado. Altamente recomendable como proveedor
B002OPGNHI|5|Excellent bag, perfect size, excellent service!
B001L1INP6|4|looks hot !! i ordered these for my Jamaican friend, hes keeps showing me his pictures of the seats in his car. lol. they look great!!
B00080QHMM|1|I bought this online,and the first day I had it I was having trouble getting an accurate reading.It doesn't fit on my 4 month old Goodyear Aqua tred valve stems.Lets the air out of the tire.I had a different brand of digital gauge worked better than this one.
B004610R9I|5|Arrived on time, good packaging, excellent quality. They look great on my 2012 Mustang GT with 18&#34; factory wheels.
B00FEYHE4M|5|As Described
B0087XOTWW|5|soft light,good for bedroom lighting!
B001FANRSG|5|Great product! Super easy to assemble. Received it super quick. My boyfriend was thrilled.
B00K6L9SIS|5|These will fit any truck the bar come 56 inches long you have to cut it down to fit your vehicle you morons I have one on my ram if you do buy one make sure you get the gutterless mounts too that are for your vehicle if you still can't figure out how to mount it go to YouTube and type in how to mount a carr light bar its not rocket science guys
B005FK5TPQ|4|Nice rotors, good fit, easy to install (although the instructions only detail how to install the brake pads.)<br /><br />Kit did not contain any anti-squeal lubricant, which is hard to buy in small quantities, and you only need a small smear of it per side.<br /><br />Kit DID have brake wear sensors, and some cheapo brake clips.  I reused the original clips which are of much higher quality.<br /><br />Overall, a very good, but not quote excellent kit, with good components but not enough instructions.
B00GDKVS34|4|Very easy to wear. Light and they breath. Not for cold weather.
B002R13RL4|5|Not only was I ecstatic to learn that this item was available in Amazon, it was available in Prime and was priced well.  After it arrived in two days, it even fit perfectly and securely on the car.  No issues since installation.
B000MK4GNK|4|Missing some hardware, was also kinda of a pain to install. I think if I had done some more research i might have purchased the K&N cold air intake. This one is cleaner looking but it just barely fits in the stock location. It seems to be just barely clearing one of my power steering lines, hope this doesn't cause future issues.
B008XNZZ7O|1|Nowhere as good as the ozium spray has worked in the past, works about as good as the fresheners from the dollar store, wouldn't waste my money on this product again.
B001N4QY66|5|Works as advertised.  Don't expect super technolgy for the price.  Is really handy and simple to use
B004HGOPX6|5|Install was ridiculously easy. Came with detailed instructions. Pretty hard to screw up. The wires already come with clips to mount to the frames.
B00KIXSXWQ|3|UPDATE: I'm dropping this product down to three stars.  After using it less than 10 times, one of the jumper clips itself snapped and broke.  This is probably because the carrying case is a bit too tight - it took me 10 minutes to carefully try to align the jumper clips into their designated slot, and even then it was a little too tight.  I guess that compromised the durability of the jumper clip, because it broke the next time I used it.  The plastic that comprises the jumper clips does seem a little bit thin and brittle.  What good is a jump starter product if the clips break?    Also, the rubber \\"flap\\" that covers the voltage port can be extremely difficult to open.  They need to add a pull tab there.  I wouldn't want to ever try to open this in freezing weather.    ORIGINAL REVIEW:    This is an awesome product.  It jump-started my faulty car several times without even significantly decreasing the battery charge remaining in the starter.    I'm giving it four stars instead of five because there are now similar products for cheaper that also include laptop adapters.
B000FQ05B8|5|Well Made for price. Fit very tightly and well. Included everything i needed but the Roll pin, so Keep your Roll pin. Very Happy with purchase
B000Z33Y1E|4|Great gift
B0041TS3H8|3|I got my mirror. It will do the job abdc it works. However, i have overlook a slight vibration on the glass mirror. 2. Objects appear normal vs closer on my manufacture mirror.  3. Its shiny black vs the matt finish on my original mirror.  It will do the job, but im mot happy that its not identical as the original.
B00029WXIG|5|this is a  very nice tool box
B00C807TJA|1|Very cheap plastic. You get what you pay for. I would not recommend this item. Does not mount very well with only 2 screw holes.
B002UCAEU2|1|The photo of this bracket on the web page is incorrect.  The actual item is much shorter than the one pictured.  Also, the dimensions given for the item are completely wrong.
B006K8K6NM|5|Fantastic bit of kit, and delivered within 2 days! Brilliant!
B00BYH6C1E|5|Works great and it ends frustrating search and reach for small items (car keys too).  This is the second one that I bought since I have 2 cars with the gap problem.
B00HQYTUYA|5|Love this item. My seat belt cuts on my collar bone when I wear any sort of top with a scoop neck. This is soft and no more irritation. Bought one for the back where our granddaughter sits and will fall asleep with her head tipped to the side. When she wakes the seat belt has really left a deep mark, with this cover she wakes and no more marks, she also likes it.
B001Y8XWAW|5|Fit perfectly and look great!
B000B8GAPK|5|Works just like the original.
B00650NY6G|4|I got this product months ago but then after reading the instructions, I put off installing it for quite a while.  First, you have to get the door all clean, you can't do it in the wind, etc.  After that put me off for a short time, my next hang up was that you have to have to do it in the right temperature range, but since it was winter, I couldn't do that.  I finally got around to installing this and it was much easier than they made it sound.  I didn't use soap--just a wet rag and scrubbed until I could wipe it off with a moist, white rag and not get the rag dirty looking (just a couple passes was sufficient).  I didn't worry about my finger prints (although on black paint, you may want to) and I didn't stress the contours. Now that it's on, you can barely see anything there at all and it appears to be pretty well stuck.  Note that this is for the front door.  The back door of my civic has a sharp turn and I couldn't find a good way to cover that without wrinkles.<br /><br />I am curious how much help this will be, though.  It's very thin (as in the width of the strip--not the thickness) so it isn't protecting that much surface area so it will only help if you hit something on the edge.  Usually that damages the OTHER car more.  I'm curious if it will help with that, but not really willing to test it out.  If I ever accidentally \\"test\\" this out and get meaningful results, I'll update my post.<br /><br />My only tip--make sure you use good scissors--the material was tough and hard to cut with my pocket knife's scissors (they usually do fine).<br /><br />Since I can't speak to the performance, I can't give or take stars for that.  I do wish the strip was a little wider, though.  The installation was simple, so a good rating for that.  I think this feels like a 4 star item.
B005OZNZD0|4|Everything went fine, product was as stated in advertisement, thank you so much for your time and effort. Great job.
B001PNC5CW|5|Fits perfectly on the 12 sided sensor.  I use this for a 2008 Chevy 3500 LMN diesel engine.  Get a wrench and prolong your sensor.
B00710481Y|1|Melted my headlight housing into oblivion.
B00GQPPO6S|5|The best suspension for the Veloster Turbo. I use to have Eibach but the vehicle use to bumps allot sence the drop is 1.7 front and 1.5 rear. Im not the kind of person to drive slow. So I remove it and went for H&R and the difference is humongous.  Softer ride but stiff enough to actually feel confident at high speeds and tight cornering.  Highly recomended for the people with are looking for performance rather than looks
B00PCI3MXW|5|Arrived long before expected. Actually a little bigger than I thought so that was nice. My dad will love having this on his tool box! Only thing I regret is not getting a few!
B0002SRH5G|5|This works great. Makes refilling the coolant enjoyable, and a lot less of a mess.Super fast refill time. I've used it on four different cars so far. Just wish they had one smaller size plug attachment, but I have made it work on evry car so far. Well made in America.
B008XLZKO4|4|Great color and good product
B005NLQAHS|5|I was looking at expensive code readers... and decided to give this a try for a tenth of the price... and it is about a 1200 dollar unit in one.. the only thing that could make this better is if I could tweak and program my ECU.. Works well and make the investment to buy the Torque Pro version.
B000KKPFFA|5|good stuff, works great!
B000P58DMC|5|I used this on my 2000 MAZDA 626 ES-V6. I filled her up and test drove for 110miles on highway these two days. I then filled her up again. It costed me 3.995 gallons. So I reached 27.5MPG! The stock rating of the car is 25MPG highway and the best I reached before was 23.5MPG.<br /><br />I do not race, so I don't know any change in horse power.<br /><br />More technical detail: The stock coil pack's secondary resistance is 12.5K, this one is 11.5K and a bit heavier. Assuming the turn ratio is the same, this Accel coil pack would have less copper loss.<br /><br />Notice for old car users like me: Make sure you have a good grounding, instead of a rotting one, before putting it up. I had trouble with this, I then copper duct taped the ground terminal to assure a better contact.
B0000DYVN9|1|not really warm or serve it purpose… so i return it…
B0076AUCKU|1|It offered no more reception than not having an antenna. I purchased it to replace my original 2003 VW Jetta antenna which was/is on its last leg. After testing the new antenna with no luck, I reattached the old antenna to be sure the damage was not to the antenna base. The old antenna picked up stations FM/AM immediately.
B003PZ2E7Y|5|these seat covers fit snug.they are very durable and comfortable.would highly recommend them.do not forget to soak them in cold water as per directions
B001EOYJSU|4|Great product, not very difficult to install if you have a helping hand.  My only regret is that I did not do more research before settling on this hitch.  This hitch requires that you use a stabilizing strap when you carry \\"non-trailered loads\\" like a bike rack.  The class-2 hitch from Curt does not have the same requirement.  Given that the class-2 hitch still far exceeds the towing capacity for my car, and I mostly plan on carrying bikes...I should've gotten the class-2 hitch.
B007I7BG3S|5|Great product. Great seller.
B00F7UN50K|5|Bright , vibrant colors and fine detail. True to size description.
B00E63TI32|5|Look out for this beast! I initially purchased a 40 oz one for work to make sure this sytem would work for me. It worked very well so I bought the 64 oz. I fill up water from my home Brita and bring to work. I keep a cup at my desk and pour from this into a cup. I am over 230lbs so my daily intake of water is over 120ozs. I typically will make 1 trip to the work Poland Spring bottle with this.<br /><br />I work 12 hour shifts and I have left water still at my desk for over 6 hours in this and when I poured it out, it was still cold. It does not make it ice colder ( it doesnt make the water colder ) it keeps the current tempature of the beverage you are pouring. It will not take luke warm water and turn it into cold water.<br /><br />Cons<br />I look kinda like a loser going to the work water cooler and completly destroying the water supply. The other day after I filled this up someone said;  Are you going camping? If you can learn to not worry about what other work people might think of you, this is the water bottle for you.
B001B7RS4M|5|Came in quick and i installed it within 30 minutes.  I havnt had it long so I cant comment on longevity and i have a tonneau cover so I dont know how weather poof they are.<br />They are made of a plastic so Im afraid if something slides around in the bed it will break.<br />Other than the one concern its serves its purpose well.  Its bigger than i though.  I fit 2 1500lb ratchet straps.  About 16 bungee cords, a tow chain and a flash light and there is still space.<br />If you're buying this for security I would look elsewhere.  If someone really wanted to open this box it wouldnt take them too long
B000CMDCKQ|5|Can't believe the price! Great product! Awesome quality. Best price in the market, my 4RUNNER looks awesome and well protected! THANKS!!!
B000Q65AY4|5|This oil drain pan has a low profile so it is easy to slide under my 2009 Audi A4 B8 and it can easily be used for two oil changes before needing to be dumped elsewhere.  What more can I say, it holds oil and then pours it out when you want to put it elsewhere.  I have zero complaints.
B008G3SWJ4|4|My other mats were all dirty.  These fit nicely in the SUV and they look good.  The ridges are low enough that they don't bother my feet.
B00D8WQC8Q|5|It fit. Blue tooth works. Not use to full-face helmet! It's heavy. Lol.
B000BZ4ZZU|5|Another perfect product from Timken. I will only purchase Timken bearings simply because theY last!
B004HE6UOK|5|perfect fit and Malibu 2010
B003FBV8ZW|5|These replaced another pair I had that broke after a few months.  These are much better made, plus they have that rubber like feel to them.  They block the wind when I wear my 1/2 or my 3/4 helmet.  Not much else to say.  Oh, they look great to, or I do while wearing them.
B00062YWTC|5|Fast Response and looks Great at Night. i put a white led light and make it looks better at night.
B005JPNXC8|5|This is a good quality vinyl sticker. Rich Colors. I ordered on a Friday and received on the following Monday. Excellent Shipping! Even received a couple of small zombie stickers with my order for free.
B000E347M0|3|Attention:  If you own a 2001 you will probably also need a heat gun.  The instructions that came with it said &#34;Certain 2001 door trim panels will interfere with installation and must be modified for fitment by heating the air duct in the area indicated with an electric heat gun.&#34;  Sure enough that is what I had to do.  Of course, I didn't own a heat gun.  Basically you heat the air duct until it is soft then install the door panel quickly so the air duct forms around the window motor.  Goofy.  But it worked.
B002P8CV5M|5|The mirror came very quickly and in perfect shape. It installed just fine and worked perfectly. The only concern is the quality of the mirror. A little bit like a mirror at the circus. Pretty wavy when you look in it. Still a great mirror for the price.
B0006HP9ZS|5|Work great.  Thanks MSD Customer Support for helping me choose the right part number.
B001ADFBVO|5|Great product, fits like a factory part.  To early to tell durability, but I am guessing a long time.  Would recommend to a friend.
B000UI8SXI|2|$23??  save your money and check out Radio shack 275-601 for $4.99, which also includes the toggle switch.
B005YTMLWM|5|The part was shipped quickly, the price was great and it snapped on perfectly onto my car's grille.<br />Very happy with the purchase!
B0031I5Z80|5|Really glad I went with these, on the Bonneville. Quality part at a great price, on Amazon.
B00180P5OW|5|I have to admit I was a little disappointed at the first look at it. However I wrote to Amazon and they took care of me and all was good. My SUE no longer sounds like a Mac Truck...and the neighbor's are happy!<br />Wanda
B001DKRGLM|5|This stuff is the best that I've ever used, and I am going to buy more!
B002P8R8R8|5|Easy replacement and it connected and worked once installed.
B0048KVU0W|5|Put on the front of my 06 Chevy Silverado. A little bit of taking apart the front gill and drilling some holes. Took about 10 minutes to install. Deceptictons attack!
B001HTQX4K|5|I traded for a newer Vette before these arrived and they don't fit.....I still love them. I'll use some how!
B000QFVJTU|5|A perfect fit for my husbands 4 wheeler.  Very strong and durable.
B008C9GCL2|5|i drive a 2007 vw gli fahrenheit edition jetta. my car is already yellow so i'm not that worried about it not being that strong of color. looks better than stock. haven't burntout on me yet (six months) btw if you watch the how to video on youtube to change your foglights yourself, also if your vw was assembled in mexico you won't need alan wrenches. it has a normal phillips head.
B00NO0G8WC|4|I was going to give these gauges 5 stars, however when I reached out to the manufacturer about there being no way to change the light on the Speedo, I was told i would receive a template to add a hole myself.  Never received email.  Outside of that they seem to wok well.
B0006Z9SPW|3|Hello, I am unhappy with this purchase. I wanted one bottle of ArmorAll but was misled into buying two bottles. The site said if I make a minimum purchase I will get free shipping so I bought two bottles, which I surely did not need, but did it anyway to meet the requirement for free shipping.I figured the shipping could go toward the purchase of the second bottle, I'm sure you can see where this is going, they charged me shipping anyway.        Misleading people with free shipping is not the way to promote future sales.  I hope I'm not writing this to deaf ears, just to be deleted, I'm sure you're looking for positive feed back but I can't think of anything positive about this misleading practise. Except for this purchase I am happy with Amazon. It's too bad that for this one sale that Amazon would have a blemish on a good reputation.        I wasn't going to complain I figured it wasn't worth the trouble but then you sent me an email.    Thank you very much  Edward Pavis
B000KA5UYG|5|I was not expecting such a high quality item. It is heavy and so detailed. I love it and would recoomend it for yourself or a gift. Great for any Bronco Fan...Super deal...do not hesitate to buy it.
B000M5W91G|3|I have been trying to look for and to buy products made in the USA and went online to find a grease gun.  Lincoln Lubrication gives the impression that they are made in the US, but when I got the product in the mail, it says &#34;Made in India - Engineered and Quality Controlled in the USA by Lincoln...St. Louis, MO&#34;.  So while I am glad I bought a product from and American company, it is a company that has evidently moved production of its products offshore.<br /><br />Grease gun works fine, but wish it was made in the USA.
B007TG7IJY|4|These fit tight to the windshield, and are just a bit tricky to install, however, they clean very well, and maybe better than the last pair I'd used... But definitely worth the purchase, not sure if there is anything better.
B00FVZG7C4|4|Windsheild came with a defect at the top of it but nothing that anyone will pick up on
B0004FO2UA|3|Bought this harness to reduce the work involved with installing an Alert Remote R350 Starter. The advertising says, essentially, it reduces the work required for installation by up to 80 percent, or something like that. Well, maybe for some. But, on my Ford F-250 pickem-up, I would say, maybe 10 percent. To be honest, I'm not sure it was worth the $16-$17 it cost me. But, this was my first install, and that may have had something to do with it. It may be a little different on other vehicles.
B001L9KI56|5|One of the best products I've purchased. Thanks for a great product with fast shipping.
B000Q6UEW2|4|Much better than the strap-type filter wrenches.  Does it's job.  Not overly exciting ... but very useful for oil changes !
B008VQ12IE|5|Exactly as described
B000LQB26E|5|Lightweight and easy to install. I got a new car and had to drive it into a small garage. These mirrors did the trick for me!
B005N53C9I|3|Does not fit a mid size SUV, the seat seam is about 3 inches short for the seat.  Stretched to the max on a 98 explorer.
B000NOVJQM|2|the magnets are not strong enough top and sides, and there is nothing to hold it tight to the floor to keep the bus out
B00CM589B8|5|A super soft and thirsty chamois. It dries the car making the paint look beautiful and also removes water spots from the windows!
B005FKI79G|4|Good product. Worth the price. No dust on the rims anymore.
B0022ZN6WU|2|1. The original shipment was somehow &#34;lost.&#34; I had to prompt the seller for a resolution. It should be the other way around.<br />2. The replacement was the wrong size - my error.<br />3. I submitted a request for return on November 5, received the RA on November 6 including a large caveat &#34;all items must be returned by November 8! And, you would think they would try to sell me the correct size. Nope.<br /><br />Now really, the performance on this order is awful but the seller expects me to return it on an unreasonable schedule. This seller has soured my Amazon relationship. For one, I will no longer purchase items offered through third parties.
B004ME8MZ0|5|They work & we are using them.  Thanks!
B00JAYO5WQ|5|Wow they are bright. I bought 2 sets and am very happy with the support I received when I had one bulb fail. I love the added visibility I get with another white light to the front.
B004GELAS2|4|Made of cheap plastic, although it still accomplishes what I needed it for which is a way to get out of my old pickup.
B001CAW2DK|5|As Described
B0002KO3YW|2|Not much to this tool. I only reduced stars due to receiving a different brand than is shown here. (part # correct, different jippo handle).
B007KDLIYW|5|It was exactly what I was looking for
B00GI2IJTI|5|C'mon its a panda with guns. Its a no brainer.
B000C9S4OI|2|Should have included a better definition than just the AC Delco number. Most dealers do not know this number let alone some novice. Always get the full details of the product one intend to sell. It cleared one of the &#34;c&#34; code but not the t/c light.
B00852QTIC|5|I have a 13 ft Gheenoe made by Gheen Manufacturing 13' in length 3' 8\\" at the beam approximately 120 lbs (feel free to look this up on line so you can see what I am carrying on the carrier). I am not mechanically inclined! I was a little worried given the first feedback on this carrier. Anyway, I wanted the larger wheels as I live in Florida which can be very sandy so I ordered it.<br /><br />I put the strap through the frame and around the Gheenoe, clipped the clips together and tightened the strap.  That was all that was involved. Then I pulled the Gheenoe around. I had no problems with the carrier. It works perfectly. I like it.
B001CF4UWG|5|Great strap for the money
B003ZYS8UW|1|I purchased the Stanley J509 with the idea that it would be nice to have on the road. I used the charger a couple of times,and had no issues. The air compressor seized on me the first  up the first time I used it. I would not reccomend this unit if you need to utilize the air compressor component.
B00XV4ZYLC|5|This morning a deer hit me while I was going 50 mph, he came in from my right and hit the bike behind the front wheel.  I wound up rolling and sliding down the pavement with this jacket.  I am fine.  I cant recommend this jacket high enough. It is a little more street bike looking than cruiser style but without it I would be very severely hurt.  My doctor was amazed.<br />The sized is right but snug.  The best design I have ever seen in a motorcycle jacket. Pockets everywhere.  Do your self a favor and be protected by Viking. I am so glad I did.
B000WEOQD6|5|It's a steering wheel cover, I order most things online.  This particular item was chosen to match the interior of the car. The cover is a great match & enhancement product.  I am a small female & always struggle to put these covers on. But job well done & the item not only looks good but appears to be just as durable... only time will tell.
B0049DYVVS|5|perfect fit for 2003 chevy 1500 truck. no complaints.all the bends in all the right places! however, installing it is not for the novice.
B00C7I4N74|5|perfect for an RV.  Keeps eggs safe
B00P2MN8VO|1|Great bag. Attaches to bar well and holds all my spare clothes and shoes for emergencies.<br /><br />Amended:<br />Bag did not last long, zipper broke. Not well held together near upper zipper location. One bag hanging on, other completely fell a part from that location.
B004XERS2W|1|Logo and writing has worn off way too fast. Would not buy again and doubt I will see a replacement.
B000BOB3TW|3|This appears to work for glass tube fuses as well as regular blade fuses.<br />It does not work, however, on mini blade fuses or smaller as the puller is too wide to fit between the fuse holder.<br /><br />Also, as other stated, it does not have any sort of tester built in.
B00GHT8NAC|5|If you have a GMC/Chevy  truck/SUV  built since 2001, your spare tire is subject to getting STUCK under the truck.<br />There is a &#34;secondary safety latch&#34; mechanism on the GMC 'spare tire winch' which gets stuck in the 'locked' position<br />due to rust/salt/mud/etc that hits the undercarriage of your truck.  Once that safety latch is seized up, you need a<br />cutting torch to get your spare tire off.  If you drive in locations where winter means snow and salty gravel on the roads,<br />it *WILL* eventually seize up in the 'locked' position, and once that happens, you are effectively driving WITHOUT a spare<br />tire.  How long it takes to seize up depends on a lot of things, but if I ever buy another GMC truck, and it has that &#34;safety&#34;<br />feature, I'm going to drop the spare tire as soon as I get it home from the dealer, and secure that safety latch in the 'unlock'<br />position permanently (probably just weld it that way).<br /><br />Anyway, this Dorman winch is the perfect replacement if you have to torch off your GMC spare tire winch and need another one.<br />You just crawl under your truck, unscrew one bolt, pop the old seized and cut up GMC winch off, put the Dorman up there and screw the<br />bolt back in and voila.  Pop the 'holder' thing thru the tire and winch it up.  Done.  And no more fear of having that safety latch<br />lock your spare tire up on you, since this winch does not have that ridiculous feature.
B00BUS3AKS|5|Great product. Easy to install and remove when necessary. Worth the money!
B006PMJI3C|5|At 6'9\\" and 220 I was worried about finding a riding jacket that fit, but this jacket was just what I was looking for.
B000C8BN60|1|Low quality product. Oil cooler fittings leak. Fan screw to short to be use. Hit are condition expansion tank. Do not buy!!!
B000CKBMIM|5|good
B002OELQ4O|5|it looks great!<br />I just wander if it would not slide on muddy shoes.<br />Looks great, as described.<br />happy to have it!
B009NMOAWA|5|Great value on a really great product. I have been using Lucas products on a regular basis in my automobiles too.
B006RAXR5C|1|As always, Amazon got this item to me quickly and with zero hassle. As for the battery itself, It is definitely a piece of junk. The terminals themselves are of very weak construction when compared to the stock battery. This is only a minor issue.<br /><br />  The real issue is as follows; I installed this battery and it cranked my bike over a bit slower than stock every time for about the first week (yes I charged it). The first cold morning I had to start my bike....DEAD. This battery was dependable for about 9 days time. This is exactly what I paid for honestly, a cheap junky battery with no dependability whatsoever. I ride year round in New Mexico, I don't drive anything but my bike. If you ride constantly as I do, or rely on your motorcycle at all, get a real battery. That is all.
B00CTFMZJS|5|The visor fit perfectly
B000E2CVI8|5|Good oil filter. I love the hex on top that lets me use a regular wrench instead of an oil filter wrench since space is so limited on my bike.
B000IYIG8G|4|I bought these brakes for my mother's Focus and put them on about 2 weeks ago with new rotors.  They are fine when stopping from speed, but when the car creeps forward and you apply the brakes, they groan.  This is a condition called \\"creep groan\\".  If I had bought high performance brake pads I would have expected some creep groan, but not from a consumer-grade brand who calls their brake pads \\"ThermoQuiet\\".  I'm hoping it disappears with age and I will update my post if it does.<br /><br />Edit:  After ~1,000 suburban miles the noise has finally decreased to where it's tolerable.  There is still some creep groan, but it's much less obnoxious and only happens if you're creeping very slowly.  I doubt it'll disappear entirely as the pad material is very well embedded on the rotor at this point so I'm assuming that this is the best it gets.
B003177JEE|5|2006 Buell XB12SCG  Open air filter opened up stock muffler, 10.5 pistons, polished heads.  Bolted on this unit with stock setting with great results!  I ended up adding a lot of fuel on the top end and a little in the mid range.
B003K36BAW|4|Perfect fit for my BMW 328i, easy to install, no noise.  I rated them a 4 because it feels like they don't have as much stopping power.  That being said, I did replace the rotors as well, and I only have about 30 miles on them and I think they will break in and feel perfect soon enough.
B004BH4E6Y|4|Nice key chain for S2K owners..  The quality seems good and it should last a long time.
B004C444V6|5|Love these Gloves.......
B004RH7UV4|2|Doesn't fit the 2005 ford mustang. The mounting bracket is completely different and the red wire bracket is facing to the side and it won't let u put the bracket on the pump. The red wire bracket suppose to be facing up!
B007010V6A|5|The Wolfman Explorer Lite Tank Bag is a great product for the price.  It is well built, with good material (including great zippers).  I expect the tank bag to last for years without issues.  The universal mounting system makes sense.  It fits my 2012 DL650L2 perfectly.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone needing a tank bag for their motorcycle.
B000JIND4S|5|Once You get it on you just...HAPPY...after my car nearly getting stolen twice Im putting everything in that i can Now i Have Alarm, A Scanner and Now this Thing! MORE TO COME but its really cool its better if you buy it Somewhere else like AUTO ZONE thats where i got mine saves you shipping cost and it defintely does its JOB! so awesome GET IT
B001RJOP5Y|1|Unless they have improved them in the last 3 years buy better stuff.  I have had 3 of them and ALL 3 of the charge controllers failed and 2 of the 3 panels have failed.  In the process of failing they ruined multiple batteries($$$$$) by either boiling them or running them down bellow 60% multiple times.  I have had good fortune with MorningStar charge controllers, Instapak solar panels and the 100 watt solar panel($199) sold at Home Depot.
B00IO067JQ|5|Fit perfect on my BMW 2003 330i.
B003CJHNYC|3|Exact part needed for a fraction of the price! Glad I found it here! Would recommend this to others who are looking!
B009DK1NRC|4|When the time comes, I'll be back for the driver side
B007CLM2JM|5|Great price, product just as described, and very quick shipping. Would reccomend.
B00310T6OM|5|Good cheap filter pre oiled
B00080QHMM|1|Even though the handle is quite solid, the silver portion where the LCD display is housed, is made of two pieces of plastic and is not secured together properly , hence when I press the guage on to the valve this portion splits apart due to the pressure and I am unable to get a good seal.<br />Useless now :(
B00C7WOXI4|5|Fit was very good. Well worth the price.
B005VKSMBI|5|see a pic please.. after a accident..very much going to save me about $2000 in labor and rental vehical if this is tge correct part.. :)
B00AMLQ4AW|5|Was exactly how detailed.
B000UHDUQE|5|Works great, great price. Used on 07' YZ250F and 14 CRF150RB.
B00173U7D4|5|&#62;,&#60;
B002P8T3ZS|5|Both mirrors arrived quickly despite being sent from different vendors.<br /><br />Both mirrors work perfectly and are a good buy at the price.<br /><br />My auto service provider wanted to charge me $400 to do what I was able to easily do just for the low price of the products.
B000BUU5WW|5|This is great to go along with the Camco RhinoFLEX sewer hose. They make an awesome pair.
B00KTIUG5C|3|Good remotes, easy to program, instructions matched vehicle owner's manual. Only con is that it did not come with extra batteries as stated in the description.
B0009H51XK|5|I give it high marks because it is cheap and it fits. No conical, reusable, fancy cold-air intake filters that require periodic special cleaners and oiling for me, as I have learned from others that they are HIGHLY overrated and expensive and can even be detrimental to an engine because of letting in too much bad stuff, leading to even more expense down the road. I've heard it again and again: cheap paper filters are the way to go. Keep It Simple Stupid.
B004WLRP74|5|nice set
B005KLS1ZK|5|I ended up using this for my 2007 FLSTFI, which wasn't on the fitament for this particular listing.  This part was listed as acceptable other places on the web.  Since I couldn't find anything else, I chose to take a chance on this one.  The diameter is larger than the stock one I replaced, preventing the rubber boot from fitting around the 6 sided barrel as did the OEM.  I just rolled the rubber back over itself and this allowed the contacts to fit.  Since I don't ride much (any if I can help it) in the rain, I don't expect any problems.  The tail lamp works as it should now.  I recommend the part.
B004LOGS70|5|Excellent in every way!
B009RC2HVC|5|Just what I needed.
B000C3XDB8|5|Due to tight location of filter on lawn tractor the welded nut on end of filter allows for easy removal where filter wrench's did not work.
B00CYLWV6E|2|I bought this since I cannot bike anymore in the rain and have switched to trail running. At close to $ 35 I was expecting a really good quality product but what I have received is really more of a walmart quality towel cut which is designed to sit well on your car seat. It does the job but I dont see how different is from my previous solution of having a thick towel for the 15 min ride to the trail from home. Again it does the job but I think they could have made it with much better quality materials. I gave it back and will just continue to use what I had in place all this while. Again if looks and convenience is what you had in mind that this is perfect but personally I think its not worth the cost.
B00QIKBE4M|4|For the price it was more than I expected. Bought it for my sportster and looks way better than the stock headlight bulb. My bike is all black so the bright white makes a good contrast.
B00NP91QE2|2|l ordered the kia optima K 5 7 pcs chrome K logo vip speed emblems,  three of the emblems stuck to the car, the others four didn't stick at all to the car,I can't send all the emblems back , the three that stuck are on the car, I won't take them off  to return them, I don't want to damage my car, so now I can't return them for credit, oh well !!!!!!
B000VKTUE6|5|Great
B005TQNOM6|5|I got this for my mom because she hated the 'old lady' basket on the walker/transport chair. It hooks on to the front or back, where every she needs it. Plus it's safer, no one thinks it's a purse and sometimes in public she feels like a sitting duck to pick pockets as a old lady in a chair. By the way, SHE uses the term 'old lady', I just call her mom. ;  ) Great bag for the money.
B000C9I8M6|5|great price, great shipping time, great experance.Easy shopping on internet the add had information to double check part number against the year and make of car and a picture of the actual part.
B000VKOD9S|4|Product was good but shipping was very slow
B00DZ35D7E|4|Price was right
B00D3YEGO6|5|So far so good. My wife loves it on her new nissan Juke. Frame seems to be of high quality and packaging makes for an excellent gift idea. I may have found a solution for Christmas. Of course time will tell.
B001KQCCBS|5|EVO sensor, installed on a 1998 GMC K1500, no more jerking of steering wheel, took the old one apart and the wiper fingers were worn completely off......
B008U13URQ|5|Characterized to work as advertised.  Does anyone know the part number for this connector?
B000QAA5QS|5|works great
B004GFTC0E|4|Easy to use, great results, it really can clean the your headlights, please make use you use the protecting tape, because if you do not, the solution will peel most normal paints.
B008CLKVBW|1|This DOES NOT fit a 2012 jeep wrangler unlimited. The space was reduced in 2012 and the tray is too wide by about an inch and a half. Wasted a hundred bucks as it has been too long since i ordered the product to return it.
B00CH60VQ8|5|Excellent. Just what I needed. Good quality. Good price. Fast delivery !
B001EOV492|5|Fits hitch and works great, didn't have to find large wrench to tighten ball
B009I397T0|1|the dimensions are not as is. It did not properly cover my motorcycle and I'm very upset with it being too small though the dimensions describe are the same dimensions of the other cover I have replaced this one with and the replacement fits my bike properly
B00HQN39B6|5|Nice add on for your car, it is a sticker that you have to put on yourself, not printed on the cap, but still looks nice...
B000W0KTMW|5|One more easy way to protect your bike from &#34;walking away&#34; to your surprise.
B00FMGO9FE|5|It's in the car and looking good
B002INP6QU|3|One of those purchases you hope not to have to use.  But when you need it, you will be glad to have it. Our hybrid truck did not come with a spare tire or jack.  I hope I won't have to use this jack!
B0034MQ9R4|5|These mats are very comparable to the slip n grip mats and the 3M dealer mats. They are easy to install and have a good adhesive backing so they don't slide around. Even with the shipping cost they are cheaper than any alt.
B00O4G8CT2|1|When you use the leviling kit you need shock extenders. Most kits come with them and this one does not. Also you cannot just buy the extenders they come in a kit
B000688VNE|5|I bought this to install on my 72 CJ5.  Being a &#34;mountain man&#34; who spends a lot of time on high mountain trails, I've found this Hi-Lift jack to be essential equipment.  Don't buy the cheap version or some knock-off brand.  Stick with the best and it will prove itself every time you need to pull yourself out of a difficult spot.
B0057GU3GI|5|Perfect match and easy aplication
B000EA5WLS|2|The one thing that this product doesn't stress enough is that your results may very depending on the type of damage you have.  This product is not very good on star cracks or regular cracks (it may work better on bullseyes). I have a star crack about 1.25\\" in diameter with the longest crack extending about 3/4 inch from the point of impact. I've read and fallowed the instructions 3 times and after few tries the product did fill in the small spider web like cracks that extend no longer then 1/4\\" from the point of impact but the longer cracks are still there and still visible. The damage does look a little bit better then before the repair but it's definitely nothing like the Before and After picture the manufacturer provides. Honestly I don't really care how it looks as long as it passes the state inspection but I'll find that out in few months.    Overall I can only give this product 2 stars, and if you are going to buy this don't expect miracles.
B001O2T43M|5|Excellent product
B007ULXTD2|5|pretty
B00CH6T18C|3|For the money that was spent, I was not impressed.  I was hoping it would clean and revive my leather coach all in one stroke, but it didn't really change a thing.  Disappointed in the product.  My couch is almost 10 years old, so may be its past its prime.
B008U1MOM8|4|When my car started throwing out intermittent error codes, this tool saved me many trips to the car repair person and of course the diagnostic fees. It connects rather seamlessly to android and windows devices, however, the app for windows is a bit lacking especially when compared to the android one. Both apps can be a bit obtuse and do not do a good job of hiding features that are not available for your car so you can be looking at only stuff relevant to your car. So I am docking one star for the app being rough. I left it on my car permanently and my mileage did not seem to change much meaning it doesn't seem to be drawing too much power. I used the device for maybe a month and then ended up getting a new car so I cannot speak to long term.
B00SC8LK6U|5|Just what I needed thanks
B00HJB70S8|5|Really good ...
B00GA3BA28|5|I was very skeptical, only ordered because of two good reviews said it fit their SR 400 and worked to keep the wind from trying to blow off their helmet. Putting it on, I thought the front opening should not come up above the light, but it works this way and look good. Even though I took the light apart in order to secure the windshield well, it vibrated when starting the engine. All was well, once rolling the windshield is steady and it does indeed keep the wind off just enough to make the helmet stay on comfortably. I like it as it keeps the bugs away from my face and it's small enough to look over, I never need to look through it. I would recommend to the seller to come up with a better picture.
B0084UIIRK|5|I was totally sick of my stock floor mats because they get so dang dirty and they move around all over the place in the back. I made the decision to get these floorliners because from what i read they are amazing...AND THEY ARE. They fit perfect, look great and are so easy to clean. Awesome purchase, worth every penny.
B002W8MXTO|5|My husband used this on his 1969 Camaro parts, and was extremely impressed at how well it works. He sprayed the part and put it outside in the rain for two weeks.  The part looked just as good the end of the two weeks as it did the first day.
B0050EITTK|5|I had been wanting this for my RV for years. We go to southern California desert for the winters and the water is so hard it leaves spots, coats your hair with a film and leaves your skin dry. When we got the softener we tested the water before we hooked it up and it was the hardest water possible. After hooking up the system the water was almost the softest it could be. So, it works; I love it!
B004809YBE|5|Good product
B00BM3WP34|5|I bought these bulbs to replace the general lighting bulbs in my RV. They fit in all the #1141 fixtures, shed lots of light, and do not draw down the coach batteries hardly at all. Previously,  we had avoided using the old bulbs unless we were camped with an electrical shore connection. We have dry camped with these bulbs for the last month and I am very pleased with the light, the low power drain, and the price. The light color is blue-white compared to the old yellow bulbs.
B000FF76KM|5|So much more easier to store than gallons of it. It cleans the windshield quite nicely.
B0007KXW3U|2|...runs off of a 3V cr2 lithium battery (wtf?) <br />...offers a whopping 4 stations to choose from <br />...has a weak, rarely clear, static laden signal <br />...because of its cute bug like features I give it a generous 2 stars <br /> <br />I would definitely recommend looking around at other fm transmitters before buying this one.  I've had it a little more then a week and I'm shopping for a different one.  I could be wrong, but I don't believe Iriver had anything to do with this product. <br />
B000HZRTDE|5|Bought this for my son to have all his auto docs and insurance info in one spot. It holds maintenance, tire, and the owners manual perfectly.
B003IS3HV0|5|This made our leather coach look like new.  I am very impressed and will purchase again.  Awesome stuff.  Worth price.
B00FFRSWYE|5|Love the smell I sit innmy car just cause now.<br /><br />Will be ordering another to place them on the rear pillers just behind my back doors in my grand marquis via Velcro stickies and ordering 4 more refills just so I'm good for the foseeable future
B006EGAIII|5|Light weight and strong.  Very happy with them.  Good value....
B0016J7KNE|4|Great product!
B004PGU7QW|5|Permatex 65108 Painter's Hand Cleaner is a wonderfully effective product if one neeeds to remove grease and grime from one's hands as well as paint residue. Highly recommended.
B00480J4J6|5|Replacing the bulbs myself saved me lots of money over what the dealer wanted for my Prius.  There are some very good Youtube videos on how to do it without taking the front of the car apart.  It only takes 5 minutes per headlight once you know the trick.  Mine burn out every 3 years.
B006KDJUGG|5|Great value and easy to install, a better than expected experience. I can't remember the last time that has happened.
B007JEK1YK|5|No problem on install, works great.
B003RW1AMK|1|Cant get this to program to my doors at all !! Followed instructions to a &#34;T&#34; several times.  NO GO !!  Even with all the reviews regarding the trunk button doesnt work, I still bought it hoping it would atleast unlock/lock my doors.  NOPE !!
B002UC4Y30|3|The actual locks (I ordered 2) worked very well and are currently in use on the gas cover doors on my two older cars.  Only problem was one lock was previously opened and stapled shut with keys did not match the lock but did match the other one.  In other words two 2 sets of matching keys and two different locks.  BUT having worked on lock/tumblers before, I reset the tumblers on one lock to match the 2 sets of matching keys.  So as my grand-daughter says... \\"It's all good\\"
