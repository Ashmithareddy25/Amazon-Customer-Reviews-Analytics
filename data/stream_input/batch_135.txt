B000BYD78W|5|Perfect, exactly what we needed and it arrived right on time!
B00G5OKR1W|5|Worked as expected
B000ARTZPE|5|This is the only octane booster I've tried so far that made a huge difference, running a 67 Firebird 400V8, 10.75-1 comp and RAI cam, I run Sunoco 93 plus this on 16 gallons. I haven't tried making my own with Toluene yet. 104+ used to work many years ago but I think it got bought out and watered down. I have not advanced my timing yet either, just bought two bottles based on what I've read others say and this stuff works, throttle response, starting, idle, WOT, all had massive improvements, this car is scary to drive again.
B007PP07JW|1|Does not stick well, hard to apply. Waste of money
B00D1CQVIY|5|This kit was bought to go on a JEEP Grand Cherokee. We also installed the 2X Cree lights, and Brush/Push bar on the same vehicle.<br />The kit is well made and it was pretty straightforward install. The switch was placed in the hole where the cigarette lighter was.<br />Would buy again.
B00SZK19XY|5|they're perfect for daytime running lights. If someone can't see these lights, they're blind.
B00P7VVIS0|5|Just what we needed - perfect fit. No more rolling car cleaning kit, groceries etc.
B007NQMNUY|4|The quality is good, but the dimensions were not as stated 8&#34; x 6&#34;.  The actual dimensions are 7&#34; x 4 1/2&#34;. Smaller then what I was lead to believe.
B00BKWTGHK|3|I had trouble getting the tape cover off without removing the tape itself. It's just ok.
B00BAYUI3E|5|Great fit on my 2015 RAVE. 4<br />Arrived before the date expected
B00OM6PB4S|5|Great quality sticker! I love how it looks on my MX-5!
B000E4JLM0|5|Excellent, perfect fit, just like the original.
B001XX1P20|5|Improves braking significantly
B0064QQIT6|5|Was getting a gascap and check engine error on my 08 JK. After reading up most had said this issue comes from a old gascap, purchased this and gascap and check engine error was gone. So, 5 stars for fixing the error.
B004A2BGAW|5|The price is not bad for today's standard, but I think all plugs are more expensive than they should be. Once installed I felt a significant difference in throttle response and better acceleration. It should be noted that my original plugs (that these replace) had 100,000 miles on them so of course I should notice a difference. However, this should stand as a testament to the impressive quality and enginuity that this product has. Trust motorcraft and buy these plugs (unless using forced injection).
B00PJPHEBO|5|Outstanding product had to down load a second app from google play to get it to work used Torque Pro cost $2.99 sure cheaper than pay a shop $100 just to tell me the code and reset it.
B00AZ4SOR2|5|Brought this fit my 2004 ford taurus. It mat a great difference
B00B1ENJ7K|4|Warmer lighting in my opinion witch is what I was looking for, not an over powering led lighting.Only one out of ten did not light up for me. Reordered to have  available when needed.
B004U29IKM|1|It was dead on arrival. Not possible for me to return the set by 12 August,
B00ZBLGW6O|5|Very good quality.
B000QGU6CA|1|The Cadillac dealer that was installing it said it was not compatible with the original and could not use it.
B000XBBISO|4|part fit and worked ok but it is not constructed as well as the one I replaced
B002EFUL58|5|As advertised
B00IANL2CO|3|Beautiful. Awesome helmet. BUT!!!! After one good hard ride. Piece off back of helmet detached and I cannot get it back in place. Never had this happen with any helmet. Maybe that's why it's only 199.
B00514BRJ8|3|My main issue is that I had to buy the whole kit. Just for the breather bolt. Can't purchase just the single piece. Which is BS.
B001DUIUJY|5|Great
B007QXYHKI|1|This kit doesn't even include the two main lights above the front seats.  I could maybe work with that and buy them somewhere else. But that isn't the end of it. After giving in and realizing I'm gonna need to get the missing two lights elsewhere I installed one map light and one over the driver side mirror.  When I turned them on they seemed to be at about 30 percent power. It was only when I turned the other map light on (which had an original bulb in it) the led lights I installed went to their full brightness. I don't want to have to turn all my lights on in order for one to work to full capacity. Very disappointed. I bought a kit from another company for my tahoe and it worked great. I had high hopes for this kit. Don't waste your money if you have an 08 a6.
B00WL66S3E|5|Truly lover these and my family love these
B00030BFN8|5|FAST SHIPPING VERY NICE THANKS
B004BWU8H8|5|Nice, secure storage. Was an easy install after moving wiring harness for seat warmers. Plenty of clearance.
B004WO15F4|5|2015 Ram 1500 longhorn<br /><br />If you have done struts before these are easy to install.<br /><br />Set them to the second setting and the truck is level.
B00RPQCJQK|1|The switch was installed to power up my inverter when I wanted power to my ham radio. It powers up on its own even though the remote key pad is supposed to turn it off. It powered up my inverter when the vehicle was parked overnight. The inverter ran all night draining my battery requiring emergency charging so I could drive the next day.
B00QN8ILHC|5|Looks great!
B00VWPNRSY|5|Luv um
B000630ATW|5|Very close to originals
B007Z2PTFW|5|I have bought two different lifts this one and one called Pittsburg automotive. Well the Pittsburg automotive twisted and the welds fell apart with three uses. The pro lift continues to work like a charm.
B0083G3AXC|5|This is a great addition to my recliners that I use when camping -- only thing is you have to take them OFF when you fold up the chair!
B00HCVRPY4|1|very cheaply made,my wife 's pocket book fell within seconds after hanging it.
B00FTB3VZQ|5|I needed to replace the rear lifts on my 17 year old Dodge Durango. WAS had a good discount price and shipped by my preferred method to a foreign destination. The product was packaged well, fit perfectly and worked normally. I will purchase from them again.
B00CMC5DII|5|It works great.
B00BB1UMEG|5|This is a great deal and they for the 2015 Toyota 4Runner perfectly.
B000C2UL4Q|4|fit just like OEM part
B001AY2WLU|3|It's okay , nothing special
B00U7ZHSBM|5|I havnt put it in yet but looks like it will fit perfectly
B00N59Y5FY|5|the seat covers worked great very pleased
B0083CJAOO|5|GOOD STUFF
B0075O1ROC|3|as expected....
B000EVU8C0|5|Along with the book computer codes now you can understand what the issues are and how to turn off the check engine light.
B00ONHHSNS|5|As shown and works well.
B0040MRX5E|5|nice lights
B000WP9KIQ|1|Ordered the wrong one
B00NJ9MZH0|5|Great improvement for the price...
B00R26RCVK|5|These work great!  They fit and protect the seats in my Toyota 4runner perfectly, dry quickly, and don't get stinky or leave a mess.   They take about 5 seconds to install, and when we are done with them or want to remove them, they fold up and fit in the door bins perfectly, so they are totally out of the way.  When I first bought the product, I thought it was a little pricey, but after having them (I bought two) for a few months and using them regularly, I've decided it's a great value.  I'd buy them again, but I don't think I'll need to anytime soon since they are of such high quality.   Added bonus:  They are made in the USA!
B007NZ6WMA|1|This compressor broke on me after one month, don't buy it! Get something for a little more money that actually works.
B00ITHVMVM|5|Easy to install, and works very exceptionally well.
B000CMEZIE|4|works well,replaced one that went bad.
B0095TD5S6|1|Horrible POS my brand new trailer less than a month old, leaked like a sieve , I thought it was my shower, after tracing the lines . I found out it was this POS.<br /><br />Water damage is the biggest killer of a travel trailer .
B00AC6Y9S6|5|This is the bag I was looking for. I can take my 15&#34; laptop, lunchbox, 2 pair of shoes, clothes, keys, mobile, wallet, and all his without expanding it! I did buy a couple of bungee cords to keep it in place, since original plastic stripes didn't seem trustworthy. Great product for those looking for space and a painless back :)
B005582C12|5|perfect
B00QX955TS|5|Very cute love it on my white Altima I get lots of compliments
B0054SMU4M|4|The bolts worked perfectly for a new walker muffler and tailpipe I bought to replace units that had rusted to unrecognizable lumps of metal on my 2002 4Runner. They're of solid construction and didn't feel squishy at all as I torqued them down with my box wrenches.<br /><br />The only ding on them is that the ones I received are not black, as pictured, but the standard sort of steel. That's not a big deal in this case; since they're going under the vehicle they could be neon pink for all I care. But I am a bit of a stickler for product pictures depicting exactly the product I'm buying.
B00K6JCQ7U|5|Perfect!
B003BZD03K|5|works well, was just what was needed.
B004IV8NBU|1|👎
B000WKALOS|5|Excellent easy install and loud!!
B00K1C1WC2|5|Nice
B00CST9BC4|5|grate fit, truck steers like it new again
B004A2GVAW|5|Notice slight performance gain over current spark plugs and quality is very good.
B00TCYV1JO|5|Perfect Fit
B00452EO7Y|1|Pretty worthless... At least the one that I got. Only port that would charge anything was the one that acts as a car cigarette lighter, and that was only when things were put it a certain way.  Nothing charged at all unless it was total blazing sun and, even after several days of testing and turning to face the sun every hour or so and propping up to angle it &#34;perfectly,&#34; it charge phones and batteries and an iPad only a few single digits and, in one case, charged a cell phone from zero to 22% (while the phone was turned off), but that was after more than 6 hours in blazing sun on a mostly cloudless day. After the last check (when we saw it was 22%), about an hour later, the phone (which I mentioned 5 seconds ago was powered off) had DEcharged down to the teens.
B000R308RA|5|12/4/16.....Still working great. I directly wired it to the truck, did not like the plug and play. Note that you void your warranty by doing so, but you have no chance of a short. Live in Chicago so winters are tough. I would buy again
B007Z1TYXQ|1|Worked for 15 min. Made in China! Not impressed!  The return was very good, no hassles!
B001O19INO|4|This cap worked perfectly on my Routan minivan and stopped the frequent check engine light warning for pressure issues in our previous cap. It's only rated 4 out of 5 because it doesn't connect to the existing tether so I have to hold it while pumping gas.
B0074EJ9CK|5|Great fit, great feel
B009B8V0HY|5|This is the first Covercraft sunshade I have purchased, and definitely won't be the last.<br /><br />With the $50 pricetag, I was very hesitant as I have always used those large, ~$10, folding, circular sunshades from Costco.<br /><br />However, with the purchase of my new 2015 Scion FR-S, the sunshades were always either too small or too large, so I decided to look into what other BRZ/FR-S/GT86 owners were using.<br /><br />I know this one is for BRZ and Amazon says it won't fit my FR-S, but if you own a BRZ or FR-S or GT86, you already know they're all identical and accessories for one will fit another (I have the Subaru OEM hard plastic cargo tray in my FR-S trunk since Scion only offers carpet trunk mats).<br /><br />The FR-S product page doesn't offer the Blue Metallic color, only silver.<br /><br />Sunshade weighs 1.6 lbs, feels solid, and fits PERFECTLY. It actually slightly snapped into place under the felt on the top like a Lego. I don't have to put down my visors to keep it in place. We will see if this holds with time or if the sunshade deforms due to the Arizona summer sun.<br /><br />I will update this review if/when the sunshade starts to deteriorate in any way. Until then, I am loving this sunshade.
B000EQVXXS|4|Cant get too excited about a PCV valve, what can I say? the price was good, it fit my car, seems to work and shipping with amazon prime is always great. You will need a 22mm wrench or socket to install this. I had to run out to buy a 22mm socket, this was after I went out to buy a 22mm wrench, the wrench was too big, in my car my pcv in in a very tight location.
B00NT7LMAI|4|Works great! Easy installation.
B00W4IDIGE|1|Looks good but ain't durable at all. And my car isn't lowered. Started to fall apart and www installed by a shop since I use a wheelchair and crutches. Regrets buying this product.
B000VW4DVO|5|Quick delivery, Nice price. I replaced an old steering stabilizer on a 2006 Jeep Wrangler Sport (TJ). That one had rusted pretty bad and just seemed too loose. This skyjacker looks nice, seemed to be nice quality and came with all parts needed, including the boot. Others I looked at made you pay extra for that. My steering seems nice a firm so far. Took about an hour to replace the existing one, but that was me not rushing. I think I made a good choice. Oh, don't expect instructions, but it's not difficult.
B004IARK3I|1|Lasted only a few months before LEDs started going out and then it shortly thereafter stopped working entirely.
B00A93Q3S6|4|A lot smaller than expected but looks amazing!!
B00PTJBC36|5|The visor fits my Mazda beautifully, it is the right color, it was easy to install, and I couldn't be happier.
B00DYAF9FY|4|BRIEF: This cheap stuff definitely can make your car quieter... but not by much.  for some frequencies of road noise, it will decrease the noise by as much as 2-3 decibels (going by instinct, not audiometer).  on other road surfaces, this will do very little.<br /><br />but, i'm happy with this product, and plan to buy more.<br /><br />SEMI-BORING DETAILS: i know very little about cars.  i know even less about craftsmanship.  i don't even know if i could put 2 nails in a wall so i could hang up a painting straight.<br /><br />i have a very mild case of hyperacusis.  in english, it just means that i am DARN sensitive to noise.  even causes pain, discomfort.  i hope no one laughs at me.  but if someone else does, go ahead.<br /><br />years ago, my previous car was a 2006 subaru wrx turbo with loud sports tires.  this was one of the loudest and least sound insulated production cars on the planet.  i think this car and it's daily noise attack was what cause my sensitivity to sound.  after 130,000 miles, and very worn and loud tires, i had to change out of it.<br /><br />but before i did, i bought the fatmat.  and, as fate would have it, my 9.5 year old car with 130k miles started having expensive problems.  had to disconnect from the wrx soon.<br /><br />only 2 months ago, i got a 2012 mazda 6 - which is an awesome car by the way.  so, i had spent about $60 on fatmat for my old car, then had to get rid of my old car before i could put the fatmat in.... now i have a &#34;newer&#34; car, that i was afraid to touch and alter its &#34;virginity&#34; or &#34;newer&#34; car status.<br /><br />.... couldn't take the road noise anymore.  so, with fat mat just sitting in my house for months (!), i decided one day to put it in soon.<br /><br />i called a bunch of people like mechanics and dealers and sound shops for estimates of how much $ to put this stuff in.<br />was told: &#34;just the trunk? $100&#34;,  &#34;whole car? hundreds&#34;<br /><br />ok, so i'm too lazy or scared (didn't want to mess up this gluey sticky stuff) to put it in myself. but i didn't want to give someone $100 to cut sheets of &#34;rubber&#34; and just press it into my car.<br /><br />so, i decided to do it myself.  was a little concerned: would it bend? would it stretch and mold to my car? can i take off the doors?<br /><br />so, i decided since i was lazy, and this was the first time i was ever going to do this, i thought (and read the internet) about what's the easiest place for a rookie to try?<br /><br />the trunk (no need to take panels off).<br /><br />sure, putting this stuff in the doors can block out a lot of wind noise.  putting it in the headliner does a lot too.  but to take off the door panels takes time, mild technical knowledge, labor.  and, ok, a rookie takes off the door panel and maybe even the headliner..... can he put them back?!<br /><br />WHAT I USED: flathead screwdrivers, sharp and big utility knife.  no ruler or measuring tape because i'm lazy...<br /><br />WHAT I DID: so, one summer day, after deciding that i'm not paying someone to put this stuff in, and going based on what i saw on internet videos, i drove to an empty parking lot far from anyone or traffic.  opened the fatmat box FIRST (open fm first and let it sit in sun while you get everyting else ready).  there are big sheets rolled into a multilayered rectangular prism (seemingly fitting a rectangular shipping box) with a small knife and easily breakable small rolling  pin.  also super simple instructions.<br /><br />i pulled everything out of my trunk: trunk mat, tools, spare tire.  i just left it on the ground away from me and the fm that was near me.  in the trunk, i just saw bare, flat metal.  and a big &#34;hole&#34; in the center with a cylinder sticking up.... where a spare tire goes.<br /><br />people say vacuum, primer.  yea, they're right - that would have done a better job.... but i'm lazy.  i just wiped the metal off with my hand and picked up big pieces of dust up threwit away.<br /><br />ok, so the fat mat is sitting in the sun for maybe 20-30 minutes on a hot summer day.  indeed, like other people say, this helps.  the mat will get more malleable, stickier, slightly easier to handle if you don't get your whole hand on the sticky side.... just use your fingertips if possible.<br /><br />so, i just minimally unroll the rectangulr prism a foot, then cut off a big piece where there is a mild bend [remember when you get this stuff, it will have been in a rectangular box for a while].  i just cut where there were creases/bends/sides were that conformed to edges of the shipping box.<br /><br /> then, i took off all the paper backing of that 3' by 1' piece i not professionally (but not raggedly) cut off.  take it to my car, look for some wide place i can put it down... then put it down straight horizontal or vertical.<br /><br />i also put a lot where the spare tire would be.  once the fm was partially on, i used a knife to slice the fm wherever it wasn't bending well.  then i just pressed it down.  was surprised i was able to get it on so well and that it stretched like the pedals of a flower.<br /><br />i pressed in with fingers.  then, i took the cheap rolling pin provided.  this plastic handle, metal shank, plastic roller broke in less than a minute.  i was indeed pressing hard, but the plastic stretched under the weight and force i was applying.  rolling thing broke off from metal handle.  tried to reattach the cylinder to the handle, tried to angle it when i rolled so it woul stay on.... this broken rolling pin turned out to be unhelpful at first.<br /><br />too lazy to go buy a new (better) one at home depot, i looked around, saw i had two screwdrivers.  i used the flat end of the screwdriver to start pressing the fatmat (fm) in.  i even used the sharp right angle of the screwdrivers to really &#34;slash&#34; and &#34;press&#34; this stuff into my trunk.  i knew since i had a metal surface under the fm, i couldn't do any damage.  i even lightly stabbed the fm into the trunk.  my fmatted trunk may not look pretty, but i got it in and on tight....<br /><br />i did use the rolling pin a little... but it would always separate on me every 14 seconds.  super annoying.<br /><br />so, i repeated this process again and again for 2 hours.  unroll fm rectangular prism until i reach a 90 degree bend, use my own big utility knife to easily cut..... look for a good place to put it, press in with flat side of screwdriver.<br /><br />ONE MISTAKE i did make was putting in one piece, then pressing in so aggressively.  after 30 minutes, i figured out it would have been faster and possibly more effective to put down lots of sheets. then, once i have one layer, i jumped into my trunk (my weight is definitely going to press fm in deeper), the press and slash, roll and finger push that fm everywhere.  i could also sit in my trunk, turn every which way, press slash, etc.<br /><br />COVERAGE: so, 25sq feet is enough to put almost 3 layers into the trunk of a midsized sedan (2012 mazda 6).<br /><br />REGRET: i regret i didn't use a heat gun.... (now how many of us have heat guns???).  i should have just used a blow dryer on max heat.  it would have molded this stuff in better.  but again, i did it in the summer, left the fm out for a while...<br /><br />hoping the hot nyc sun will make my trunk so hot that eventually this stuff will meld and mold to achieve awesome adhesion.<br /><br />RESULTS: i tapped on the trunk when i was done.  definitely more &#34;solid&#34;.  like there is more metal there to block out some of the noise from the rear tires.<br /><br />SUMMARY: i'm glad i did it.  car is quieter, more comfortable to drive and sit in.  this stuff is cheap.  if an amateur like me can put it in, anyone can put it in.<br /><br />ADVICE (for trunk): just leave this stuff out in the sun for a little while... do it on a hot day (no joke), maybe buy a metal roller (not the plastic one included with this kit).  cut,put it on, do one layer first,  hair dryer (to make fm even more stretchable and more easily moldable.... then get in your trunk, sit on your rear end or balls of your sneakers, press/slash/stab/roll, turn on your feet while sitting inside... repeat repeat repeat.<br /><br />if you get air bubbles, slice it open with a knife, press in really really good.<br />if you have stuff left over... for goodness' sake, don't waste the stuff you paid for.  find someplace it will fit in and press it all in.  this stuff is only a few fingernails thick.  if you have some irregularities... like some pieces asymmetrically on top of each other.... who cares?<br /><br />just get as much fm into your car as u can.<br /><br />this stuff will do you no good if someone is in garbage.  make sure it all ends up in your car.  even under your spare tire if nowhere else.<br /><br />final words: ok, i know this review was long, maybe a little repetitive... maybe a little boring.... hopefully it helps one or two people out there.<br /><br />btw, if you really want  a quiet ride, go for pirelli cinturato p7 all season plus tires.  quietest tires man ever made.  most annoying noise from the car that you always hear is tire/road contact noise when car is in motion.  wind and engine noise can be mitigated just by slowing down or driving sanely..... but road noise will alway be with you even in local driving.<br /><br />if anyone has ? or feedback, please do reply.  i shall attempt to offer helpfulful advice.<br />thank you for readingi even lightly stabbed the fm into the trunk.  my fmatted trunk may not look pretty, but i got it in and on tight....<br /><br />i did use the rolling pin a little... but it would always separate on me every 14 seconds.  super annoying.<br /><br />so, i repeated this process again and again for 2 hours.  unroll fm rectangular prism until i reach a 90 degree bend, use my own big utility knife to easily cut..... look for a good place to put it, press in with flat side of screwdriver.<br /><br />ONE MISTAKE i did make was putting in one piece, then pressing in so aggressively.  after 30 minutes, i figured out it would have been faster and possibly more effective to put down lots of sheets. then, once i have one layer, i jumped into my trunk (my weight is definitely going to press fm in deeper), the press and slash, roll and finger push that fm everywhere.  i could also sit in my trunk, turn every which way, press slash, etc.<br /><br />COVERAGE: so, 25sq feet is enough to put almost 3 layers into the trunk of a midsized sedan (2012 mazda 6).<br /><br />REGRET: i regret i didn't use a heat gun....

B00F4X3F3C|5|GOOD PRICE.
B00KCXRG5W|5|excellent product.  100% satisfied
B00KTI9UQ8|5|Took one attempt for it to work correctly and five minutes total between reading and setup. Exactly what was needed for the older 02 Silverado we had that had lost its keyfob.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Lights arrived quickly and well packaged.  These lights seem to be well made and installed easily enough.  My install took roughly 6hrs to complete with these 4 cube lights, 20&#34; light bar, mounting brackets, 3 relays, accessory fuse box and 3 dash switches.
B00E1SJ648|5|excellent as described
B0012UK3M2|1|These bulbs don't last long. My right side low beam quit working after about 6 months from the time I installed these bulbs. I was in disbelief that a bulb would burnout within that short of a time period. I rarely drive at night either. I will never buy a Sylvania bulb again. I wished I had read some of the reviews about this bulb first. It is such a pain to install headlight bulbs in my car too, so I have that to look forward to all over again. Also, I didn't notice that they were any brighter than the original bulbs. I wished I had went with another brand now.
B008899JNY|5|I love this product!
B001B5R19Q|5|If I could rate this product 10 stars I would. When I held this flywheel I realized how much lighter it was than the stock flywheel. The car spools up a lot faster in the low rpm range. Haven't really had a chance to hammer the throttle yet since I haven't really broken it in yet. I also bought the matching Exedy oem clutch kit (yes this works with an oem clutch) 10/10
B00HAEOUX2|5|Perfect! Works great!  Shipping was much faster than originally planned!
B00OP98OSM|4|Came in late, but I was immediately informed of the error, and everything turned out great! Love the sticker, have it proudly on my Hydro Flask
B000S2U604|1|Description said it fit my 2011 Malibu - its does not. Need ACDelco 15-81687 which is  $105 instead of $20. Of course I find this out<br />after tearing the car apart.
B00HSE3E3G|4|Sent first one back as the heat strip developed several bubbles.  Second one did the same thing so I just assume it's normal.  Works great temp wise, but it is super stiff.  Even with following instructions and preheating, it is still a major PAIN to get straight.  I ended up just leaving the curls in it.  It makes a tripping hazard and looks trashy, but it works.<br /><br />The d I ulble female adaptor with males on both ends it a great design.  Very handy and gives you options.  Water flow is adequate.  Finish is also nice except for the stiffness curls.  The bubbles suck and Camco needs to fix it or I will not buy another one.  That's the thing with Camco.  Some of their products are great, but others are just cheap Chinese dung.<br /><br />This hoses packaging says it's made in the USA.  I love that and is the reason I kept the second one even with its flaws.<br /><br />Kinda spendy, but worth it since it is an American made product.  I would recommend this product and hope Camco improves on the stiffness and bubbles.  I think the two are related as the bubbles from the hose trying to straighten out.  My guess is an improvement in the rubber/plastic compound would fix the problem.
B004JCE9E8|5|Fit my 2013 Kia hybrid. And was about $50 cheaper than having the dealership do it....
B00BVL7XK2|5|A nice, basic tool.  Stainless steel, with an aluminum handle.
B00ATXEPQI|1|failed within a year of purchase
B000HNAA8W|5|GOOD
B00OA8679G|2|I really like the look of them but one of them broke already so I'm super disappointed.
B003V3RVWI|5|AWESOME!
B005TMIKYM|5|This fit my Fit perFITly.  I have a 2008 Honda Fit.
B005LPK2W0|5|Exactly as I expected.
B004AIFJO0|5|no problems
B0058FETMM|5|:)
B00K8CWDI2|4|I got this for my dad after he was quoted 4 times as much for one from a dealer. I thought it couldn't hurt to try this one out. He's had it a few months now and so far so good, definitely a worthy purchase.
B005STIT1U|5|Like putting on a nice pair of earrings.  I hated seeing the blank tag. As soon as this was placed on the car, it looked really nice.  Also, the quality of this license plate was better than I expected.  Even has a great warrenty.
B008BA97WS|5|Works great!!!!!  3 of 5 on difficulty.
B00AC5WX8U|5|Works  Wonderfully
B004007EOG|4|Excellent
B00KTIQAZW|5|Saved a lot if money buying this. My dealer charged $50. to configure to my car but would have charged $95. To buy and configure. Wish I had bought a spare.
B00CNEQYF6|5|This is my second set and they are very good.  I will probably buy some for friends.
B00B1ENIJO|3|Works just fine
B000CMHN3S|4|I bought it to complete a set ... it has worked fine up to now.
B00Q5JRJBS|5|A must have here in sunny south Florida . Well made. Several friends ordered one when they saw mine. Most pads are flat. I like this one with the &#34;stops&#34; for the kickstand. Great purchase.
B000HKVDKE|5|nice fit, looks very nice,easy install
B008VGEALU|3|Came quick still trying to figure out how to install it on my softail deluxe
B001AMHPNM|5|I'm going to buy this. I'm convinced it will be great to put up Xmas lights around my eaves ..  And for whatever else I might want to hang.  :).
B008427D88|5|Great - thanks..
B00P9OF04I|4|Worked as advertised.  Took about 10 minutes to do both headlights.  After finishing step 1 the headlamp will be a little foggy. The step 2 spray makes it clear
B00W8DBZQU|5|fit perfect.
B000OF9LRO|1|cap did not fit my manifold tightly,think about that before buying. would not ever buy again.
B004MSZC3G|2|They work but are dimmer than traditional bulbs. Also cause quick blinking.
B00S0B1TVK|3|Looks good, but the LEDs are low quality. Half the wires weren't even soldered onto the board inside, and the bullet connectors vary in size, wtf?
B00JVYRVDU|3|loved the fit for the front seat the back seats to narrow so does not protect the floor very well
B00480BWCI|2|They broke on the first use.  Very disappointed.
B004NV6FE2|5|Changing tires is friggin hard
B0051SE8TK|5|exactly as expected
B00FQ8TZ5W|4|Expensive for what they are and Dodge should really have these already mounted on my 2015 SRT 392 Charger. You do need these as they will protect the sills, so just get them and be done with it. They look nice!
B000XBCURW|4|good stuff
B0068MZ9GY|5|This oil filter is exactly the same as Jaguar branded ones the dealership will sell you. This is very important because the filters the parts store carry fit the car but are much smaller in diameter. These are a few dollars more, but just examining the difference between the Mahle and a Purolater you can see the difference in size and layout of the filtering elements. The Mahle is made in Austria and has a check valve inside. The general consensus among Jag mechanics is to stick with dealer brand filters for AJ16 engine longevity. But I feel you can't go wrong with a Mahle filter since they are a Jaguar OEM manufacturer. And if like me you don't live anywhere near a Jaguar dealership, ordering good quality filters online can be a hassle.
B002EO2AW6|5|Thank you nice
B00LCASTZA|5|Great price fixed problem.
B001O156W6|5|Exactly what I wanted
B000IEZDZ0|5|Great look! Only took about 5 min to install. Don't worry about the Phillips screwdriver driving them in it's a waste of time. Just push them in and the screw tight. Cool addition.
B00STN8FIY|5|Indeed, took away the shifting issue. Very good.
B001O0AMZS|5|Great product. It was just what i was looking for. Looks great on the genesis coupe and its pretty awesome that every lug nut is a lock.
B00EAJT3VO|5|worked just fine will order again when needed
B000PAM9KO|5|Perfect fit for our 2011 Honda Pilot.  She seems to be breathing better with her new filter installed!  It's so easy to install, too -- why pay $30 - $150 (yes, I've been quoted that price at my dealer!) to have a $13 part installed when it is VERY easy to do in your own garage or driveway?
B009W3Q4RO|5|worked just fine will order again when needed
B000BUTDCA|4|This is the cheapest adaptor.  It works fine, but I don't use it for extended use.  Doesn't appear very high quality and would not use it under heavy load.<br /><br />I would recommend this product for light use or to have as a just in case senario.
B0002KO3AG|3|I have had this awhile now, and use it allot on a 57 chevy. Its a bit too small and slips off the fender frequently. But price was right and it earns its keep when I throw in the trunk on cruises. Never know when you have get under the hood on these classics.
B0002ZR4UC|5|Top Quality. No issues or corrosion over time and much use.
B005WWO7YQ|5|Excellent product for my diesel truck.
B00F9RWGUQ|5|great item thank we are very happy
B00QXE42QK|5|Great sticker!
B00GQFR1TQ|5|Easy installation, easy uses and great quality camera. Eveything that was promised on the box. Great job. Would recommend.
B005G3XFW6|5|awesome!!
B004VUC026|5|loved it
B004AQS9HQ|5|Awesome product. Haven't tested flotation yet but have been able to change my different pitch props with a breeze. Would definitely buy again!!!!!
B006BDGDXI|5|I was worried about ordering any electronics from online, but I had nothing to worry about. It was excellent condition!! Works beautifully!! LOW priced and fast shipping!! Feel safe when ordering from this seller!! Thank you!!
B00F4S1DI6|5|Great and  a 1/4 the cost from the dealers.
B000C2AISU|5|Fit perfectly
B00L4AJNOY|4|It's easy to install but the poles do not go in and come out so easily. Also, some heavy items caused the poles to bow slightly. It's a very nice product otherwise.
B000GV4SPQ|4|Look great, sound great. For install had to file weld on muffler inlet before  muffler would slip on. Also two nuts for muffler bracket missing.Overall great product and prompt delivery.
B00J3DBMNY|5|Fits perfectly!  Very happy with purchase and prompt service.
B00HSW341A|5|have used this product, best on the market. Arrived on time
B00KMBEMZG|4|A little trimming to do to make it fit but otherwise it works fine.
B003NZSABK|5|Works well but overpriced
B00KL3ALGO|5|Very easy to use and it stays up!  This purchase is a no-brainer.  Buy it!
B003UCJEOI|4|these things work great to transfer gas or fuel oil from larger cans to mowers,snowblowers and generators and so on. The outlet hose will go bad after a while and I have not found anything that works to replace it but at this price,just get another pump,in fact I just ordered 2 more,just keep batteries on hand.
B0086680VG|3|Not bad 😊
B0055RDLJU|5|Just what i ordered and was easy to install !!!!!
B00LX6GIAG|5|Perfect fit.  BMW Bentley guide says to slide old marker forward then rotate up and over and remove.  Don't worry about that.  Just use a good non-marring pry tool (a few $ at harbor freight) and use blue painters tape around perimeter starting on door side of marker.  Pop open the door side, then work your way to the front and pull.  You really can break anything (that was my worry) as the old light is the casing and if fits into the cut metal of the body.  When re-installing gently push /work into place ( remove sticker on new light first, this should help).  When it gets about 85-90% in, take a one minute break (trust me) go back and the rest should go in easily.  First side takes about 10 minutes, second about 4 minutes.  Total time less than twenty and they look great.  Just like OEM.  Oh and be sure to check operation and working order before you pop new ones in after the (easy clip) wire harness is connected.  ( Installed on '09 335i and look great)
B00029WYEY|5|Works great. It cleans and it recharges easily as advertised. Good Product.
B000630JA2|5|Works great so far, keeps engine at desired temp. Not loud to me.
B005DM0OC4|5|Easy install! Awesome!
B00N2BSFD8|5|Great job!
B0008F68MG|5|Working great!  It is heavy enough for what we pull.
B004Y4U6TS|5|Great
B00OIEB2CY|5|Great fit looks good easy to put on.
B006ODKUIY|5|Perfect Fit! Always a pleasure with Amazon
B004W97IY6|1|Dont fit in 2002 ram 1500
B00WRRIQAK|5|Excellent product, exactly like advertised, arrived on time!!
B000GU293U|5|Perfect
B001R8ZS6A|5|Cute little sign that's out of the box. I just wanted something different than that yellow thing. Thanks!
B00KMM6A6Y|1|Mine lasted 23 days and quit blinking orange
B000CGVP4C|4|Great stopping power, only downside is there is A LOT of brake dust. If your wheels are black, or you don't care what they look like, then it won't matter. If you want them to always look clean... good luck. Personally, I drive in a lot of rush hour traffic, which calls for aggressive driving, and I'm glad to be using these brakes cause I'm pretty sure I'd have rear-ended somebody by now without them. (Note: I have EBC Greenstuff on the front and back and put all 4 on at the same time so I can't say for sure what these alone would do, with the other set being a standard set.)
B001GS685G|5|I apply Apqapel 2X a year, not weekly like with the other product
B002XLGSDM|5|Good fit and very strong.
B00Q7GESUO|4|I used this for the back seat of my '96 Suzuki Sidekick. It's really had to find seat covers to fit such a small seat. Keep in mind it might take you half an hour of finagling to get it to look perfect. The back of the seat won't look very professional because it does have straps criss crossing to hold it on, but no on sees that so it doesn't really matter. I recommend putting sewing machine oil on the zipper if it covers your seatbelt buckles, to make it easier to zip and unzip.
B008YK1YXK|5|Fits small. Great looking helmet!
B001SAUNXK|5|Love it. Difinitely makes it easier to find keys lol.
B004I0XI5W|2|It changed my life.
B006OQ35GU|5|A must-have to do a dirty chore correctly.
B00NH63Y6Q|5|these work great, sooooo bright.
B007RINCE4|3|Pretty but not durable. I lost one of the blinG shortly after I put it on the card.
B000C5G106|5|Perfect!
B00NNTT7VS|2|Just ok
B000EGRA5I|5|Look cute
B000R5IASC|1|Worked as expected once. The second time I used it the Ford adapter nipple simply fell apart.
B000KKLLFS|5|No surprises here! I lost a couple of caps for my car so I bought these and they were a perfect fit. Happy enough with the price
B00IQNMVWS|1|didnt look like anything like the picture..... no gold separating the petals nor was there the gold bub in the center....
B004AH6Q3Y|5|Perfect - No Problems
B00YOBR3DI|5|What a great deal on an authentic BMW replacement part! I am thrilled and the shipping was very fast.
B00JDQ3E46|5|Great gloves!! I ride all over the place with these. They broke in really easy, unlike most gloves. I feel these were definitely designed for women and not just because the color, the fit  in the finger is spot on!! I have recommended these to several of my lady rider friends and they have bought them and feel the same. GREAT riding glove!!!
B00274JM7E|5|Very convenient for traveling.
B006V7TD9K|5|easy to hookup,looksgreat
B00RE6KV48|5|This is by far the best leather product I have ever used.
B00BXPPGH8|5|Re all nice!
B0066RI08U|5|Awesome support
B00O83NOMQ|1|They're melting from the inside out..look great but there's definitely a issue there
B00X0G3U5I|5|Cutest thing ever. I haven't places or because I'm trying to find the right place but instructions are perfectly easy to follow.
B000CDAELA|5|work well and are quiet
B002WJAK0C|5|I have been using this everyday for the past 18 month and the battery is still going strong. I use it at about 16 psi for hvlp and 24.5 psi for HE
B009QRWGD2|1|THE RACKS FIT NICE ON MY 2013 HONDA FIT . THE NEXT DAY WAS THE FIRST TIME THEY WERE ON MY CAR IN THE HONOLULU SUN.<br />THE RUBBER THAT IS ON THE INSIDE DOOR BRACKET PULLED OFF AS THE GLUE HOLDING IT ON TO THE METAL MELTED.  THE RACKS ALMOST FLEW OFF THE CAR.........  LUCKY I STOPPED IN TIME . REMOVED THE RACKS AND SENT THEM BACK ......
B001DMDT7U|5|This product arrived in perfect condition and quickly.  Easy to install and fits my needs perfectly.
B00GE8QK3I|5|Great thanks
B00HUFY7UW|5|Perfect fit and looks great
B00RJ80AS8|5|To the poster who gave the lowest rating possible for an item he didn't even buy:  REALLY??  The sentiment of this bumper sticker is what matters here, not your opinion of the business name.  ALL lives matter, but this phrase is trying to make a specific relevant point.
B006GR0FPQ|5|Looks & works great!
B000RZPNOQ|5|Works really well!
B009XIRPO4|5|Bike runs great with the new gears. Love them
B008BSUZSA|4|Battery seems to be just fine, during shipping one battery out of 2 was damaged leaking battery acid. Reported to Amazon and the shipped another battery. Very pleased
B003AZDLAI|5|Nice
B00PBO0Z3M|5|Wonderful very good company to buy from fast shipping very well built
B0077T23EI|5|Worked well. Kept the bike stable for over 1100 miles innour toy hauler.
B00JW0FNQU|4|I have used 1 can of this stuff - so far so good.  Let's see how this works over the long haul.
B00ZYDE1B2|3|It is a perfect fit , it should be more clear on figment it says RZR BUT SHOULD INCLUDE RANGER 800 , it would take the guess work out of buying it
B00VMSNNJ4|5|Best Mazda HPFP internals on the market!
B000BQWLE6|3|barely bigger than a single soda can-- read the dimensions to make sure this is what you want.  Ok for the car maybe
B00FA846HA|5|Fit good looks good
B006JRJ5L8|5|now my filter doesn't blow off the camper with unknown water pressures
B00KN0UOEE|5|Works great. Reviews from auto and marine sights say it's the best. Drys without greasy residue.
B004QQ8SEY|5|Did the job. Ordered at the same time as &#34;Johnsen's (6312) R-134a A/C Refrigerant - 12 oz&#34; here on Amazon to recharge two cars.
B00KTJ7U3M|5|Remotes worked perfectly
B00FE84KIQ|5|That little extra to protect the door sill from dirt and grime! Product and shipping as expected.
B000IYGFWA|5|Wheel hasnt fallin off yet! Seems good. High quality.
B003G9IYQY|5|Got what I expected when I expected it.
B00P2D3VZG|4|Disapointing. Not as bright as stock bulbs. They are very white but not bright enough. Stock bulb is in drivers side. The Philips LED is on passengers side. See pictures. They might be good enough for somewhere else like maybe a reading lamp or map light. But not for shining on the floor. UPDATE:: They work great for my map lights. Nice and white and bright enough for the map lights.. Great fit in map light housing. Chevy blazer 1995 with little round map lights. Photo will come later. Photo's uploaded.
B00T0X4B6W|1|Dont even bother.  The back window is pretty much impossible to do unless you have 8 arms and hands. I've made 3 attempts as per inst. and same results everytime...film ends up sticking to itself. Once that happens - its toast.  Get it done professionally unless you want it to look like crap.
B000C32JAO|5|The continental elite serpentine belt completely eliminated the chirping noise that had plagued my vehicle for months, caused by the use of an inferior belt brand. The serpentine drive is now silent, and Amazon ensured that I received the proper size belt for my vehicle. I couldn't be more pleased with the belt and Amazon's handling of the transaction.
B00YT21GXK|5|I love the floor mats and my steering wheel cover. They look so great in my car! Great price and fast shipping.
B0040CYTFQ|1|Not good..!!
B0002RQ3V6|5|Fit perfect, fast shipping and good packaging. No problems and easy install
B000182BBM|5|Put this on a 94 camaro z28. I can now &#34;chirp&#34; gears in 4th...The performance improvement on my 20+ year old car is significant. Truly impressed
B00LL1OWRO|5|Bright and cool, a little hard to plug in
B003TYP48C|5|Perfect fit for my 2013 Sierra 2500hd!
B0022ZJSWW|5|Very Nice
B00ZE5RGTY|5|Great bundle of products that are essential for organized drivers.  It really helped me to clean up my car and put my things in order.  Excellent value!
B00UEMH5L6|5|Nice new look
B006B376WK|4|Awesome dust picker upper
B0012X48Z2|5|Great. Adjustable feature is great.
B00COOT6X2|3|Ballast just went out on me under a 9 months..
B000CN95RY|1|To start I fully would love poly bushings on my truck but the idea of selling this kind of part for a 97 model truck without sleeves is stupid if your vehicle isn't new then don't waste your time trying to press out and save your old sleeves. I can only imagine trying to do this on a northern truck. after trying to heat and press one sleeve out I quickly realized what an idiot I was trying to install these, returned and ordered moog. Save yourself time and money. These aren't worth it.
B00G6188EM|5|Great product exceeded my expectations looks great on my bike easy to install
B00XZ9MZI8|5|This is a great product.  It worked great on my daughter's 2004 Mazda 3, which we bought with only the key itself, no fob.  Before I purchased it, I called our local Mazda Service center and provided the VIN number to make sure that the car had the keyless entry option.  When the tech told me it did, he said it would be $208 for them to provide and install one fob.  I told him that I saw it on Amazon, and he said those &#34;do not work&#34;. Well, guess what, it works great.  I programmed it in about 45 seconds and she absolutely loves it.  She feels very cool to reach over her shoulder and lock the car as she walks away.  Very great product, and very easy to program.  Also it arrived in about three days.  I am very happy.
B000C9XZKG|5|It fits the application perfectly, no problems.
B00NTLV01K|2|Super nice well designed helmet with a great built in visor screen.  The visor screen is top notch with the push-to-drop push-to-retract function being the absolute best.  Unfortunately protective shell (the foam not the liner) was glued in crooked and the entire helmet sat crooked s.t. the built in visor didn't line up and looked idiotic.  Shame too, seemed like a really quality helmet in all other regards.
B000GU2MFA|5|The piston rings fit perfectly, once I cleaned, cleaned, then I cleaned them again the ring grooves that is.<br />After that everything went together<br />very easy and methodically.<br />Just before putting the cylinder head on, I honed the cylinder walls with a cylinder honing tool. wire brushing all gasket surfaces after gaskets have been completely removed !!!
B000C9OJUQ|5|good
B00A5UEOLG|5|Super Fast shipping!!! Super easy to install on my 2013 Tacoma and makes life easier.
B001SLEPB0|5|It's so hard to put on (I only have the strength of a teenager lol), but once I succeeded it looks great!
B00504R7JS|5|My wife loved her sticker
B00MC72Q1K|5|Brighter than incandescent stock bulbs! The instant-on brake lights really help to get the attention of distracted drivers (pretty much everyone these days). These work well for the Running/Brake/Turn operation with a good differential in brightness between the Running/Brake-Turn signal. I use these on a Jeep Wrangler 2000 fwiw. I used an EP26 flasher module made for LED operation and it provides the correct flash rate... no addition of loading resistors required.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|does its job. my car is black, and it's made a world of difference!
B00EVY3RQU|4|Works well just not as large as I expected. I should have looked closer at the dimensions. However, it does work well and was shipped as described
B008BLKI2U|1|FROM WHAT UNDERSTAND, BLACK OR DARK TINTS ON CAR HEADLIGHTS ARE ILLEGAL IN ALL 50 STATES. HOWEVER, CHECK THE LAW IN YOUR STATE BEFORE BUYING THE TINTS.
B00HMZFHI6|5|JUST ADDS TO MY SUPPLY OF METRIC FASTENERS, NICE ASSORTMENT
B00QYBJPGY|5|This Veterans back patch is my favorite. The black and white colors is simple and cool looking and on my leather biker vest it looks fantastic. If you want one you wont be disappointed.
B00D3DAY4I|1|Cheap garbage.  1 of the 4 (bought 2 2packs) never worked.  They also literally fall apart due to the heat under the hood.....the adapters are just sitting inside a plastic shell, no epoxy.<br /><br />Buy the Kensun brand instead.  (don't own them yet, but I imagine they must be better)<br /><br />Returning these for a refund now.
B007IOBM4E|5|Great product--super value--very pleased
B000M65PM0|5|AAAAAAAAAAAA=++++++++VERY FAST SHIPPING. VERY HAPPY
B00TQHHCTK|4|as advertised/arrived promptly
B0050MAIYG|5|I got this for my wife and it is STUNNING looking on her!!!  It is also very well made and warm.  She loves it too!!
B0048J6VW0|4|Installed easily... took about 90 minutes (I take my time). This seems to be an improvement over the OEM design. There are 3 screws and a plastic insert that must be salvaged from the old regulator assembly (the plastic insert is what secures the power connector to the door).  It would've been better if ACDelco had supplied the plastic insert, as salvaging plastic parts can be problematic. [1999 Jeep Cherokee Sport]
B003RAWZTO|5|They look even better in person. Very happy.
B00FPCW9HA|5|Exelent fit for my 1987 325 is.
B00GWV57FY|5|Fits well and looks good I have not noticed any sign of the item fading but I do park in a garage when the vehicle is not in use..
B0078J1WWQ|5|very nice!
B001CK9PLW|1|Was not overly happy with the quality of product, sent it back and had some issues with the USPS the seller went out of their way to make me whole and am pleased with them but I cannot recommend this product.
B00LNKZM90|5|Way back in 1997 I just had to have oem mudflaps on my red 91 GTI. Fast forward almost 20 years and I had to have them on my new mk7. They are functional, subtle, and the opposite of the boy racer look.
B0060UGHK6|5|Perfected fit . Easy to install
B003UT5VKW|5|It doesn't get any better.
B000TMCX72|5|Works Great
B001HMAXYI|5|very good quality !
B00KF1UYPK|5|I have them on my car in the back window and can see them and they make me smile.
B00LUZB9LI|1|Useless, unless to take off the top and attach a different ashtry on top and use your own cigarette snuffer.
B000CI6Y9G|5|Same brand as original
B00G6Q48S2|5|very nice i like it !
B005257R0O|5|This tint is amazing, I just needed one pass to do my back lights
B007ZGKKMA|5|A bright light that is perfect for a work light, which is what I used it for.  Works great!
B0009VIQ1K|4|The item comes in handy for quick use.
B0031ATK3E|5|New and improved style much nicer.
B00ULPXJRU|2|Garbage. I got it and the little bands where the hooks latch onto were torn. I tried to put it on anyways and they just broke. The material felt decent, but you get what you pay for.
B001T9AREK|1|Can't recommend this tool at all!<br /><br />The hose is a low-loss fitting that isn't serviceable!  The vavle core depressor can't be remove!  The o-rings can't be replaced either!<br /><br />The injector body itself is nice but the cap is tapped 1/2&#34; so finding a replacement hose takes an act of God!  If that were bad enough, the hose has permanent threadlock used on it which makes removing the hose quite difficult!  Using a 1/4&#34; fitting I guess would have made replacing the hose much to easy!<br /><br />Steer clear of this injector, poor design and not serviceable friendly.  I guess they want you to throw it away and buy a new one rather than fix it!
B00NCNZPUM|5|looks like em part
B00O7CLV1O|5|The good stuff. No doubt about the quality!
B002GTK89Q|5|Work's great
B002GTKAHQ|3|bolt threads strip easy
B001FAGJB8|5|These are awesome, they particularly go well with my black Jeep, I barely know that they are there.
B00IKKS4W8|5|Very well built product. Would highly recommend anybody looking to stabilize their trailer
B00AV8HLNA|5|Good quality, good price.
B001TYJOG2|1|watched the installation video 3 times & tried for an hour,patiently, to make these car seat covers work….feel like an idiot…  Was supposed to fit our 2015 toyota rav 4. They don't . Waste of time. A strap tore off (not man handling ) in the ordeal. We are capable people who have pioneered land, built things , fixed things, organized & instructed others in all manner of things, yet these covers are a mystery to us…our seat cushions do not come out, as instructed in video, among other installation issues.
B0016KBSDG|5|Nice part.
B00FEYE3HS|5|Factory seal, fits and works perfectly
B001KSA1V4|5|I had already replaced my front pads and rotors with &#34;premium&#34; pads and rotors from NAPA and they were absolute junk.  They were about 30% more expensive than these pads.  They blackened my front wheels within the first 3 days and continued to do so for the two months I left them in place.  Finally I tired of being the resident wheel cleaner and ordered these front pads from Amazon. They were advertised as being OEM pads for my '07 Silverado 1500 along with a new set of OEM rotors AC Delco #177-1014.  They produced a little gray brake dust for the first day or so as the protective coating was worn off of the new AC Delco rotors. Since then my front wheels stay clean, the brakes work as effectively as they did when the truck was new, which is to say very effectively. Very satisfied.
B004A6JA2O|4|This product is a high end cabin filter. You will get lower priced cabin filters. So let me cut to the chase and answer if it is really worth the extra bucks... Yes. In my personal experience I have used this product for over 2 months and it was able to cut out moldy odor in my car.<br /><br />Installation was easy but it would be better for them to indicate which side should go in and which side is up. (- 1 star for that)<br /><br />All in all, I am satisfied with the product.
B000F0G0S6|5|Car runs much better with noticeable improved pickup. The price was also the best to be found on line
B00F3QXO8Q|1|could not produce a spark from my 1982 Honda nu50 --useless.
B000IYX4O2|4|Very good
B00V5T3TPS|5|I received these as a free review sample four months ago. They have been in use for the past two months and have proven to be off-road worthy if properly mounted.<br /><br />Since there are detailed specs I'll highlight what I especially liked and some unique features.<br /><br />First, the pigtail that you need to splice into your electrical system is very heavy duty. Note that it's only eight inches long, so you will need to run a lead wire from your vehicle's fuse box to it and unless you are running the pigtail into your vehicle you will need a waterproof connector. I am mentioning this because this set is designed to be installed by professionals or hobbyists who are familiar with wiring.<br /><br />Second, the lights in this set have a wide operating range between 10 and 30 volts, so as long as you have access to a DC power source in that range powering them will be easy.<br /><br />The main thing I love is they are exceptionally well constructed. These are truly off-road quality. In fact, I want to emphasize that for regular, public road use you will want to connect these to a switch because they are bright enough to blind oncoming drivers.<br /><br />Bang for buck these are some of the best off-road lights I have tested, and mine have withstood two months of use that prove their ruggedness.
B00PXM15MM|4|Just arrived.  First impressions.<br />Pros: easy to set up and connect.  Seems to charge as expected.<br />Cons: Description says 12V and 24V at 7A but, once it arrived, it is 7A in 12V mode but only 3.5A in 24V mode.  I bought this for a wheelchair charger at 24V and wanted the 7A rate for faster charging so that is my main disappointment and why I did not give 5 stars.<br />Lingering questions: Manual says 24V mode peaks at 28.8V which is what I would expect from a 24V charger.  Rating on the unit itself indicates a maximum output of 25.6V which would maintain a battery sufficiently for storage but never fully charge it (see picture).  I am not sure which, if either, is correct.
B00C7XIY7E|3|Very good quality looks neat
B004C46ISS|5|Came on time and was exactly what I wanted
B00EKUKJWA|5|Nice deep set screw.  Holds the cable firmly, as it should.
B006UH6YVG|5|great
B0000AY4YX|5|works great for removing oxidation on the boat!!
B007VR7A6C|5|Shipped fast and is a great product! Holds battery down secure and an easy install. Just a minor sizing adjustment cutting, but to anyone handy it is a simple task. Highly recommend!!!
B0015YE3QC|5|GREAT PRODUCT!
B00XPJWK4W|1|it is a little low on compression only 130lb should be 150 to170lb range
B001C6N6WK|2|cheap part. you get what you pay for. would not order another one but can't get factory.
B000FPYHOU|3|Nice, clear readout and small enough it gives many options for placement in/around the dash of most vehicles. Of course it blacks out if the car gets too hot, but anyone who used these types of clocks (or even most wristwatches) from the 80's and 90's knows and expects this. However, what I did not expect is that the light button is completely useless. Yes, it turns on a light, but it somehow also masks the display or hides the clock readout...so I can either have a light, or I can know what time it is, but never both at the same time! It's too bad too, because even my junk Timex Ironman from the 90's has the lighted time technology figured out.
B003ZHU45Q|4|Not quite perfect for the SunTracker Pontoon boat with 50 HP Mercury, but I was able to make it work.  This is a fairly Robust product, but they placed the bolt Hole in the wrong place for the SunTracker Transom Saver that came with the 2005 Model Pontoon Boat.  I was able to make a Spacer out of thin Plywood to put behind the V Block -- this lined up the bolt Holes properly, and kept the Block from rotating out of position when holding the weight of the engine.  I'm fairly handy at fixing things, so this was only a minor nuisance for me -- I expect to get great service from this V Block -- but WHY can't they get it right??  Be sure to Lubricate the outside surface of the rubber to get it to slide into position in the Metal V of the Transom Saver -- Saliva or Silicon Grease is perfect, and will make a HUGE difference in the ease of installation.
B001D566IG|5|verry good
B00IN5BU8U|5|Great replacements for dead rear struts on our '06 grand prix. Perfect fit and superb comfort and stability improvements.
B00OZ8SDMU|4|Four stars because they feel a bit flimsier than the AVS that I'm used to. I didn't get to use them because I ordered for the wrong vehicle. My fault, not theirs. The good news is that I have a set for sale, dirt cheap if anyone wants them. Message me.
B00CM589B8|4|Decent product.  Mops the water off my car without lint.
B002QGVW3K|5|excellent
B008I7PAUC|3|The price is good.  It fits. But it's smaller than the original and the angle on it is weird.  It's like it's angled for a car and not a van.  Because you sit so much higher up, you can't tilt the mirror enough to look all the way straight behind you.  Also, the mirror, not the housing vibrates a lot at highway speeds.  Annoying.  But, since the first one I ordered from a different seller had the wrong pigtail and this one was right, I'm not messing with it anymore.
B0016IHR7Y|3|Just didn't work out for problem.
B005DKUBTM|5|Does what you need it to do, keeps the quad covered.  Nice quality should last.
B0010Z4MDK|5|nice
B009FREAGO|5|Perfect little bag...easy to attach and empty.  It was a great addition to our road trip this year.
B002XL2IBS|5|Does a great job fjor what it was sold for.
B00SKEDJTW|5|work great on my 89 GMC with a 454,
B00C5SGEQO|5|Really work,be sure of fit and all will be well.
B00032KBFE|1|Picture is misleading. Shows tapered pointy end when in fact they are blunt ended.
B001AIZ5HY|2|This product is a lot of work, and I didn't see much results. I would not purchase again.
B00CYO7E04|3|I spect a litle bit more
B00GHS1NXW|5|Worked and fit great. A little hard to instal fronts, but not because of product.Just no instructions
B0013AV9B0|4|A very quiet running cooler. Took it on a two week vacation and ran it eight to ten hours a day. It worked just fine.
B00H9JZ7DU|5|Was exactly what i expected fast shipping also
B00H338T9G|5|Look great.  Fit is perfect.  Arrived quickly.
B000K00DSO|5|Fit my 2007 Avalanche
B00CG5RYEW|5|Nice size
B00PS69DYA|5|Give me a little assurance though would be nice if they came in pairs
B0042KYS4I|5|I got these for my girlfriend's car and she loves them!
B000CO7NGI|5|Just installed in my 06 Yamaha Fz1 and it works perfectly.
B00HWI4GEE|2|It looked great at first, but the chrome began peeling off after about 6 months which is outside the seller’s warranty period.  It looks bad now and I’ll have to replace it.
B000C9WJBM|5|Used this on my BMW R1150GS. Fits well works fine.
B00B9F338Q|5|Fast shipping. Can't beat the price
B001TJXWH4|1|Not worth it. The towels don't even come clean
B000EFCPOK|5|Great product, just as advertised. Amazon Prime delivered next business day for free. Some reviews said it's too large, but perfect for my needs. Very soft and pliable, great for drying down my car after wash
B000EA5WLS|4|Easy to use and works as indicated.
B001AX9WJQ|4|it works until I take rodeo out into the hills. its just a temporary fix in my case but works.
B000C9W2AK|3|Installed on an 86 Dodge 2.2 turbo and the fit was perfect.  These have a nylon (plastic) center cage and glued fiber end caps. Should work ok but not the ACDelco of old.
B000C2MAMM|5|Installed and working; thanks
B00BCRMB34|4|it's good and arrived in 2days but it does't fit perfectly for my 2004 Toyota RAV4, not enough but not bad
B00L32L4A4|5|I bought a brand-new Silverado a few weeks ago and ALMOST bought the official GM tri-fold tonneau cover for almost a whopping grand. Holy cow what a mistake that would have been.<br /><br />This cover is the bomb! Fits perfectly, great price, and looks great. Thank you Tyger for providing such an awesome product!
B00029XHZ4|5|Easy install and so far has held up nicely.
B008I14UYU|5|the right light but a little pricey
B000C2CL5I|5|Worked perfectly
B002P8QGW6|5|Fits great.
B00K3GBRQ2|5|Can a LED bulb be TOO bright?  I use this for an Interior dome light. Basically it light things up inside like it's the middle of the day -at night! Recommend!!
B00JGR6GV0|5|Again, another purchase for my Son. Needed exactly this.
B00RTFVGWU|5|Just like the picture. They don't look cheap. Comes 2 in a box with extra rhinestones and glue. Arrived on time. Super cute! I'm in love with them. Mine came with lemon scent but I haven't used it since I only want them for decoration. Might purchase more for room decoration!
B009D3E36W|5|These tire tools are the handsets thing since the pocket on a shirt. I was totally pleased with the price and the way these tools worked. Changing the front and rear tire on my 95 vf750 Honda magna was made so much easier with these tools, I use them on all size tires and I am very satisfied with price...fast shipping and Great quality I recommend these to any and all
B006JJX166|4|Streetglow is quality. All of the Heavy Duty LED Strip Lights are nothing short of amazing. They're such a flexible, durable, bright light..I wouldn't have it any other way.
B00NPIIEKW|5|This is an awesome license plate that I had ordered for my new vehicle. The problem was that my new vehicle did not have a spot for the frame on the front. It would've had to be drilled out & since it's a lease I couldn't do that. Other than that, it's a great plate!
B009XIN4F8|5|Great product and it arrived on time.
B00BQWQLP4|1|These bulbs are not as bright as a set of the Sylvania's Midgrade Bulb that I bought a few years ago.<br />Very dissatisfied......I was truly expecting a marked difference over the MIDDLE GRADE Bulb that I currently had in my vehicle.  As soon as I get some free time, I'm removing the Phillips bulbs.
B003VCDI7G|5|worked great
B00OZTN28E|2|does not fit and it looks cheap. i would not recommend this product to anyone. i did not return i will donate or throw away. not happy!!
B001ABL5QQ|1|No noticeable increase in performance either in power or MPG savings.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Fast delivery . Great bright product makes daylight out of darkness
B004HNT4WQ|5|Works Great
B00M47U9OY|5|Works fantastic!!!<br />Plug and play!<br />fill it up, and your car is COLD again!!!
B00KVL4QOE|2|This states it is a &#34;Car, Truck, Van or SUV&#34; sun visor but unless you have a tiny truck this will not do. I have a Dodge Ram 3500 Dually and this item was about 8 inches to short in either dimension to even be able to stay in my windshield. It's a good screen if you have a car or small truck I suppose.
B004YIW05W|5|One light wasn't working. They sent me a new one right away. I would recommend these to anyone
B00SWGPT14|5|Heavy duty and made well!!
B002PQU7UA|5|Good replacement lights!
B00BYH6C1E|5|This is my third one. I have two sets for SUV and my car and got this one as a gift. I love it! Never loose my phone, keys, coins, etc ever again! Give it a try, best product!!!!
B006JJSMJC|4|These are extremely usable. The fact they're so thin makes sure you get a good contour to your edge. They could've been brighter, but honestly they worked great for my customer.
B004GEHPCC|5|fit perfect nice product
B004L46EOC|5|Great covers!
B004XONRYK|5|saved my transmission
B0026THWBS|3|Nothing to write home about works as well as other of its type but I would recommend the superglue type over this as it is cleaner and dries much quicker with less mess.
B00O8ZNJ2Y|4|The light is excelent, but it dont fit 100% in Dodge Journey, I needed to cut the border.
B008BYRGYA|4|Very happy with the product louder than expected very pleased they look alot like stock except the exits should of came with a name badge on them saying the brand but I understand why they call them big n nasty they say loud pipes save lives and these pipes speak all that truth good buy for the money.
B00MQA3KVI|5|Love it !!!!
B000NQ1122|5|Works Great
B006F914PK|4|The windshield is pretty decent except for a few small issues. Fit is not exact but is close enough to not matter much. Hardware was all there, but clips are loose on windshield, original Vetter clips were a tight fit, these allow some movement, which in turn allowed a small crack to start developing when exposed to high speeds. Top of windshield had a small chip, not anything that would affect it's usability, but annoying nonetheless.<br /><br />If I need a new one in the future, I would not hesitate to re-order. If I have time to kill, I would probably take the old one down to a local shop and have them make me one out of thicker plastic. This shield seems to be a bit thinner than the original and starts to wobble a bit at 70-80mph. For most uses it should work well, for cross country and high speed highway use, only time will tell.<br /><br />Update: went out to get pics and found that one of the nylon screws had vibrated itself loose as well. Recommend adding a dab of thread locker to them once tightened.
B002LFZFPM|3|When it got hot in sun the glue now has leaked off of item and they want to pop off.
B0089LSKFY|4|Like
B005N53AM2|5|Smell was sort of strong but more of a 'new car scent' that went right away after I sprayed it with Febreeze. I have a 2012 Mazda 3 and it fit perfectly and looks so pretty! This is a great deal!
B002N5T4LG|5|worked great to fix camper.
B00EXG3XAG|5|Great choice for those looking for a rear sprocket when doing the YZF600R 17&#34; rear wheel swap onto a FZR600.
B00KQIB4LU|5|Great decal delivered in just a couple of days.
B0002ILK72|5|Exact replacement and excellent packing.
B00HNXETTA|5|Works well. Mounted it in my garage and used it right away. A lot easier to get paper standing up straight than bending over.
B00062YB8E|5|No problems after two years of use.
B0018EV9R0|5|Great rain gear for the price. I recommend. Save your money. This gear is all you need.
B00ZSDVKIU|4|Great product
B00KCW5SA8|5|Amazing product! I received it within 3 days! Nothing like receiving your order a week early!
B0043063JU|5|way better than  the fabric ones
B00CYLHD94|5|Absolutely love this cart!! My 12 yr old beagle is now able to go on bike rides with me instead of being left behind. He loves it more than I do!!!
B000VDX170|5|Still using these 2 years later. Love them! Easy to clean.
B000BOKML2|5|Used it, sprayed it, so far so good 9 months later.  No signs of corrosion on the battery terminals.
B00KLKLTK4|5|Worked exactly as described.
B002P8LWDO|5|Amazingly fits into my car. I was skeptical initially  but this worked out really well. Overall satisfied with the product.
B0037R8GA4|5|Perfect fit for our Town & Country van. I love that these came with replacement clips. They fit better than the old ones!
B001QW6H1W|5|Installed on a 2014 Ram 1500 crew cab and it fit perfect.Took almost an hour to install, if had to do another would take less than 30 min.Looks great and have had several compliments.Just have to remember to raise the rear section before you shut the tailgate.
B003ZJ2HMM|5|Fit perfectly, arrived early, easy install
B00CJ5BOFE|2|Did not include intake gaskets. Big disappointment, I'll get vesrah gaskets next time. Other than that the gaskets work, just wish I got ALL the gaskets when I buy a complete gasket set.
B005CWA812|5|Heartland is a go to company for specialty tools. I just received this inner cam bearing set today and it works every bit as well as my old bosses set that cost substantially more. People complain that they don't include instructions, but if it isn't completely obvious to you how it works, you probably shouldn't be doing work to your engine that would destroy it if done improperly. These are very well built American made tools and I will be buying more.
B00FALVU8A|5|It was very pleasent to apply and looks great.
B002WRRNFO|5|I use this in my car when I want to lock up my valuables, and at home to secure a gun. It's very well made.
B00C0P98C4|5|Good product. Work as expected and fast shipment.
B001RJN56Y|5|This is an amazing smell. It has been around and sold by Air Spencer for at least 15 years that I can remember. It is a smell that people always say. &#34;Your car smells good what air freshener do you have&#34;  Amazon smells it for a good price. You will not find it locally in your area. The only places I have found it locally is in asian markets.The smell lasts a couple weeks. You will get used to it in about a week. People who usually don't ride in your car will still comment on the smell after a week even though you may not be able to smell it that well.<br /><br />REMEMBER you don't need to buy the case that they sell. I just buy the cartridge. I place it in the side panel or middle console. If you buy it I am pretty sure you will NOT be disappointed
B011HXK24M|2|These did NOT fit 37mm forks as specified. There was still a couple millimeters play so I had to get creative. They are however strong and if correctly fitted are secure.
B00TZMM2NW|3|Love it... But it was missing the perches!  :(<br />Still love it..  Need to go to hardware store and buy dowel rods!
B00I50553E|4|instruction were pretty clear.  Make sure you have exactly every tool needed on the list and a very good jack and stands.  I did one side at a time, which may have made it a little harder.  BTW, the front is now a half inch taller than the rear.  wish they had it in an 1 1/2&#34; kit.
B00OUD8TU6|3|These are much bigger than they appear.  Had to return them.
B00CPSWKLC|5|Used it on my black mailbox.
B007JG1W1E|5|exactly what I wanted it works great for odor control as needed for the p trap and woks great for me
B0041PYGGO|5|Worked as advertised. Shipping was on time.
B00J8D5QH2|5|Very durable covers.  The protection they offer is far superior to the generic fit covers.  They only item that does not fit perfectly is the center console bottom piece, however it does fit.  I am a smoker and cover the seats to mainly protect from the rogue hot ash that burns the factory covers.  These are a little more pricey than others available but the fit, protection and look is much better.
B005PZMLDY|3|Completely generic since these are made for multiple models. Must have a lot of patience to put on. Head rest covers don't fit very well on Honda CRV '08.
B008HZLHB6|5|Very good product.
B003IS3HV0|5|My wife went to Mexico and got a messanger type bag that was made of thick cowhide.  She never used it because it was too stiff and she had to force it open to put things in.  Thats what made me get a bottle of Leather Honey. Folllowing the instructions I put a thin coat on the expanding sides of the purse and let it sit over night. to my surprise the sides of the expanding section were softer and able to open and close more easily  The leather is pretty thick and it certainly didn't make the purse super soft.  For that I would have to buy something and soak it in that solution but, it did make it softer than it was. I than coated the whole purse inside and out to see what would happen.  I have to say this is a great product.  It made the purse  soft and less stiff.  It worked for me.  I am perfectly happly with this product.  I recommend it to all my friends and will buy it again.  There is s mild castor oil type smell but not over powering. I was given a discount for this product to review it.
B00SUWNSBI|5|Best little upgrade you can buy, awesome piece.
B001B16NP8|5|Had to order 4 gallons for my husbands Ford F-250 diesel truck. Best price & so convenient!  This is the only way to purchase!!
B000C2UJNO|5|Great Price. Decent quality. Works great on my 2003 Civic Hybrid.
B0002F68JK|5|Decided to purchase the windshield cover to reduce sun deterioration of motorhome cab area dash & upholstery. This windshield cover exactly fit our  2004  Jayco  motorhome  with a Ford E450 Cab.
B00NQ198LC|4|Product works great.
B0089H7PLI|5|I've got two of these on my CR-Z and I love them. There is not many good plate covers without being a generic one-fits-all type deal, and I wanted something more custom to my CR-Z. This was the best I found and the quality is great. Just wish it had prime shipping!
B00Q5JRD00|5|works good so far.  It fits in a small fork bag so you can take it anywhere and is well made.
B0013G1TPU|5|Nice module, fast shipping, thanks.
B00SXBA97M|5|Great item, well made. Looks good on my Softail Deluxe.
B00ISLA1WA|3|The adapter did not have clearance measurements available on either even on the manufacturer's website. I found the offset between the center of the 1 1/4&#34; shaft pin hole and the back of the 2&#34; receiver was only 3 1/2&#34; which was not enough to clear my bumper and allow the pin to be inserted. I ended up returning it. Make sure you take the above measurements before purchasing.
B00OO9AS9G|5|BFM!
B003XXUWF4|5|Great ebayer
B007IVQYRC|5|These mirrors work as advertised and at a great price.  You don't want to pass this one up...  I highly recommend this product for anybody looking to replace their dull or broken mirrors..
B00387WNUC|5|This fit my Ford Focus great.  After the original rubber mount fell apart, I decided not to go with a rubber mount again for the propensity to fail.  The Prothane should never have a failure.  The fit was tight, but that is how it is meant to be.  The drive feel was still very tolerable.  This is the only option I would use if I were to do the job again.
B00JA3BMDW|5|My husband liked this thermal gun . Works well.
B000WJBF58|5|Fit was perfect and looks great.
B003TODXQW|4|Good tool.  Works exactly like it's supposed to.  I set m8 nuts in 3/16 alum.
B00L4TF32G|5|Excelent produkt for my convertible top and interiør
B000E3XKAA|5|We use this in conjuction with the Power Steering Reservoir and bracket kit.<br />Power Steering Reservoir and Bracket Kit - CM110 and 5225<br /><br />Although we use it as a fuel cell breather. It works perfect so far. Very happy!
B00CZG1VZU|4|Good
B00KN6AR7C|5|Protects my fish finder just like it should.
B004SRRSOM|5|works great on my Altima!
B00029WRKA|3|Did what we needed them to do. They bounced quite a bit. Next trip I am going to change the rotation of the mirror. For the price it filled the bill.
B0018N6L3S|5|Was better than i expected, they fit perfect.
B003BM5LUI|5|They work great, this one to replace previous that was damaged.
B00K2NQ0AY|5|Great addition to my truck. Easy installation.
B003PB4AY8|4|Good product. Easy to install with the clearly written instructions. Exactly what I needed to install my supplemental spal pusher fan on my classic.
B000CAZ2HO|1|Does not fit 2004-2005 TDI Passat with BHW engine code.
B00RGQ1OJW|5|Just put this on a 2013 Triumph Street Triple. Took off the seat, installed nice and snug. I wanted something not too large for everyday getting around. I really like the firmness of the bag. It has a plastic liner sewn in around the border to give it support. The bag is nice and solid. You can lean back against it as well as a back support. The rain cover is quality made as well. Has a full zipper around bag to allow expansion upwards for more room. Has a neat clean look on bike.
B0024E6V30|4|Good price
B00BN44SXW|5|Awesome key fob. Top quality..
B000GTUEL0|5|Did just what I expected - volume is still the same but it's less trebly with more of a mellow tone.  Very happy with the results and the price.
B003JO6H9C|5|works great
B0002JM8PY|5|How would a garage crank get by without this stuff? If you drive or ride old machines, a tube of this and a trusty rattlecan will get ya lookin' ghetto/hillbilly fabulous in no time.
B0009IQZH0|5|great
B00UIDLDJQ|5|worked great.  replaced our old cord that had become stretched out over the years.
B00993O8RK|5|Reasonably priced good looking product fast shipping
B00V73O9BK|3|Quality is ok.
B00DB8RAF6|1|The grill did not fit my 2008 ford f150. The brackets that connects to the hood were not at the right angle.
B003ZJ4MFM|5|Easy to install and works great!
B00LW1YNE0|1|Well it worked great for a day and then it died and only the coil pack works with my old cdi box the new cdi box doesn't work at all anymore
B0090JVTYI|5|:)
B00475I38K|5|Fit perfectly on my 2005 pathfinder! Very easy to install. Took me about 20 minutes. I used the factory housing instead of the ones sent with the lights. Highly recommend these lights.
B007A56LAG|3|Good fit
B009FUFBTG|5|Great all purpose rags to have for home, kitchen or shop.
B000ALG18O|5|had to convert to snap on and works well
B00PBO0Z3M|5|The lights were well packed and arrived with no damage and in a timely manner. They were an exact match to the original's and have be working great.
B000CIPIMA|4|Came ahead of schedule. Hardest part of installation is removing the old exhaust. Highly recommend cutting it. Has a nice deep sound, with a great start up noise. The tip I recieved was not the turn down tip, but it fit on my Jeep without issue. It did have a minor dent in it which can be barely spotted due to the finish. Did not feel like going through the hassle of returning it for a new one so I just kept it. I would definitely suggest this exhaust. I saved money over the Borla I wanted but was still more than happy with the sound.
B00G9CS9ME|5|Best purchase I have ever made
B004GCGLQ0|5|Good Product
B00E1SNC6Q|4|Delivered on time as promised.  They were the correct fit and reasonably priced. I was satisfied and would recommend them to anyone.
B0017OFXAA|3|only lasted about 6 months
B003U4RVW8|2|Not that good
B0060U92FS|5|works great! very nice heavy duty switch!
B0028JLO3I|5|Very useful mirror. Be aware, though, that it is difficult to lower the sun &#34;blinds&#34; with the mirror in place. It is necessary to move the mirror, lower the blind, and then re-adjust mirror -- not a great problem bu probably not safe to do so while driving, so you need to set &#34;blind&#34; according to expected sun prior to setting off.
B00AXNLNSW|5|They fit perfect and were fairly easy to install, just had to take my time and use a little muscle.
B0055DP5JI|5|fit perfect, was very reasonable and fast shipping.

B00PWG6AC4|5|Quick and easy to use. Snaps into the corners so you do not have to use the visors to hold in place. Kept the son off of the dashand seats keeping the vehicle much cooler
B00VB2OILS|5|High quality and doesn't fall off like other covers I had
B003GC96U4|5|Great fit and works well.
B00C3NA5MA|5|was a gift
B00498IEE8|5|Just as expected
B008E7PNZI|5|Cheap brake pads.  Seem to be lasting so far.  No brake fade or above average noise noted.
B0075XGZFO|5|Love it
B005XZX8RY|5|Great product, easily installed and keeps my transmission runningmush coole.  My truck has a transmission temperature gauge and after installing the cooler it is indicating 50 degrees lower than previously.

B00FC22IRY|5|Works awesome
B001BFO7DO|5|worked great !
B00JN0U4SQ|1|Terrible radio reception. Also, color started fading within a month of install and worst of all, it broke off soon there after.
B00UB9R4KO|3|Bought this unit directly online from Emotorwerks in April of this year. I have two EV's, Chevy Volt and Mercedes B Class. The connector has always worked with the Volt, however, on the Mercedes it would only work about 40% of the time. After connecting the Juicebox to the Mercedes the internal unit contacts would click twice, instead of once. Meaning it wasn't charging. Very frustrating to have an evse which would only work on occasion so I sent the unit back to Emotorweks and they gave me a replacement last month. The replacement unit only worked for a few weeks. It doesn't charge right now and I'm going to send it back for the classic 40. I agree with the Amazon review by Max R. that the Pro 40 does not work with Mercedes B-Class. I don't know why but I have always had problems charging it the Pro 40. Hopefully changing to the classic model will solve my problem.
B010H0QV00|4|This automotive emergency tool gadget includes several items that can be useful. There's a mini screwdriver, scissors, and seat belt cutter, a glass breaker, a flashlight, and the tire pressure gauge. It's nice to have all these items in one device, though if you misplace it then you've lost all those functions at once. To activate the batteries you will need to open the battery compartment and remove the protective tabs. The construction of this item is solid and it would make a great gift for any car owner. I was provided a free sample of this item for my honest review.
B00LIXQ7UK|5|Works great, only miles will tell the big story! Shipping was reasonable and a smoking deal.
B005C5DZR8|5|Used these to tie down my classic Jaguar XKE.  Excellent product - worked exactly as I'd hoped and greatly eased the task of safely transporting my classic.  Gave me great peace of mind.  Shipped promptly and arrived on time even though I ordered them only one day before I needed them.
B00JAXXDAM|5|So far so good.
B004RCSW6G|5|Works great
B00W5MG8XY|5|Works as advertised.
B004BFW0EO|4|I purchased this for use on my black car which has been parked next to sprinklers for 5 years.  One side of my car was free of water spots and the other had significant spotting- to the degree that you could see white, chalky water rings and the surface felt rough.  Prior to using this product I used the following: Mcguiar's water spot remover (only took out the finest of spots and with a lot of elbow grease at that), Vinegar (supposedly works, but I think the spots on my car were just to old and built up), Mcquiar's 2x rubbing compound (no difference even with a DA polisher).  So I read about 3D Eraser.  Like most reviews you get some great reviews and then you get some &#34;didn't do a thing&#34; reviews....which leaves you wondering which review is representative of the products efficacy.  I decided to try it and found that it does work.  I found the following:<br />1) For light spotting- when used as directed (1 minute on, then rinse off): spots wipe away.<br />2) For medium to heavy spotting I applied the product evenly to one panel at a time, allowed it to sit for a minute or so and then used my DA polisher with a spray bottle with water to keep the surface moist to work over the panel.  Depending on how heavy the spotting was it took two to three rounds of this to clear up the spots.<br />3) For windows it seems to get the &#34;tactile&#34; spots, or spots you can feel off of the windows, but I could still see the remnants of the spots through the glass.<br /><br />How much do you need?  To remove significant spotting from one entire side of my car (SUV) I used about 1/5th of a bottle.  I was surprised by how little it took to get the job done.<br /><br />I did not experience any etching or other distortion of the surface, though I didn't allow the product to sit for much longer than a minute at a time.  I'd say I was able to work out 90% of the spots on my car- the small remainder were just spots I didn't want to take the time with, but I think with a couplemore passes as per above, they could be worked out.  After a new coat of wax, the car looks much better.<br /><br />Why four stars? There are cons: 1) its a hazardous substance, so use proper protection as you would with other cleaning products, etc. 2) it may take more than one application and some added work (manual or use of polisher) 3) It doesn't seem to take the spots entirely off glass.<br /><br />This being said, the product labels the hazardous materials appropriately and they make no claims that this doesn't take some added work to achieve desired results.  I'd say the product works as advertised for the most part.
B001PWFPE8|1|Supplied shock is not strong enough to assist the tailgate on a 2007 Silverado.  Once installed my tailgate would open just as fast as before I had installed it.  I contacted DeeZee and they said it was a defective shock but told me I had to obtain a whole new kit from Amazon.  Upon receiving the new kit from Amazon it was just as I had feared the new shock was no better.  This is an extremely low quality product that did not perform as advertised.
B004N6PM6Y|3|Disappointed for no installation instructions included.
B00T4USC4S|5|Sign says it all. Sticks great!
B003ZJ2HMM|5|This fits my 2015 Toyota 4Runner SR5  perfectly.
B000M8IF1Q|5|Works great as a brake lube for pins, rails and also doubles as a brake quiet compound on pad backs.
B000IOFVUM|1|Purchased this because I do a lot of work on older cars, 60's and 70's,  Sosa it is advertised as it ting compact cars and up I figured it would fir 1/2&#34; tie rods such as on a 1989 truck.....no way.....the smallest is still to big so a waste of money and time.  A real disappointment .
B006JJRV58|4|I haven't installed these yet. Not to worry, OPTX consistently produces high quality products.

B002JFQFNA|4|Great for the price.  Bought a second pair because I'm sure they will break at some point but the last pair lasted several years.
B0006IX814|5|Product arrived quickly and was as described.
B00C8YXH9C|5|Be careful with these. I had to use them and a 747 landed on the interstate. Just sayin!
B005F9IJCC|5|Item was packaged excellent and fits perfectly.  Very high polish and looks great, if you can live without the gmc logo these are the way to go.
B000C2ALZK|1|No clue what this fits but doesn't fit the oil pan Spectra Premium 38A it was purchased for ,an inch short ,but the oil pan was not the correct one for my 2001 Chevy Tracker 2.0 as it said it was ,not really ,did not give a engine size at all ,just said it was the correct one for my year model Chevy Tracker ,no engine size in description ,mechanic said it must for the 6 cylinder ,the OIL PAN ,Gasket my actually fit the 2.0 ,who knows ,not me
B00KOSKOH2|5|👍
B001ABL5QQ|5|It seems on the high end I'm getting gains but not too sure I notice the low end changes. But my truck sounds like it has a turbo so I think that's cool.  Easy to put on, takes like 20 minutes.
B00ECWFGYW|3|Seems a bit flimsy when stepped on it.
B00V54JMTU|5|Great
B00JT4HB14|5|Perfect match!! These look great - just like the other 3 on my car.  The dealer was very prompt and courteous.  Can't believe what a great deal!

B005ZZH7U6|5|They're Good..!!!
B00C7XVCGE|4|Product works fine . Did the replacement myself with no prior experience beyond watching youtube. Seems a little undersized but does the job . Nice to be able to open from outside!
B0016LE80K|1|Worked for two days before one side of the inner spring broke. Not very robust
B00RE6KV48|5|My husband is very picky about what he cleans our new car with. I had to talk him into trying this product. He decided to try it out on his wallet first. He was very impressed with how well it conditioned and moisturizer his wallet so he went straight outside to do the car! While I did receive this product at discount, I am very impressed with the quality of this leather conditioner.
B002XF1VW6|4|This gas exhaust gas analizer works pretty good, the only reason is that does not get 5 stars is that is not very accurate, the advertised accuracy is 0.5% for CO which helps but it is on the border on being useful since California DMV has some very strict requirements, and under those requirements 0.5% of error is a lot.<br />However this is a must tools for older cars to pass emissions, it does not measure other gases that are required by dmv, however by having a low CO you will most likely have  low hydrocarbon emissions too.<br />This tester will not guarantee that you pass emissions on DMV especially in California, but it will greatly increase your chances of success, a tester that would guarantee success on DMV would cost over 10x the price.<br /><br />The proper way of using this tool which is not documented anywhere, is to remove that CAT, then check the exhaust and do the proper adjustments, and then put the CAT back before going to DMV this will most likely assure you pass emissions.<br /><br />The reason the CAT needs to be removed, is to get as much of an accurate reading as possible, since the CAT will capture much of the CO, the reading would not be accurate with a CAT, however even with the CAT on it will help however your reading will not be accurate, but it will help in the sense that if the reading are high for CO with the CAT installed, you will fail emissions for sure.<br /><br />Also most smog places are under a lot of regulations for the governments, the only smogs check that they will do are for official smog checks, and that is something you want to do only after an smog check tunning, and that is precisely what make this tool very valuable, most smog check places will not do any smog check tunning even if you pay them to tune your car, they will only follow the official procedure, and the official procedure seems that you have to fail first before any tunning is done to the car.<br /><br />I used it on a van e150 and it works fine with gasoline and also on propane, the plastic tube will melt over time it does not resist the exhaust temperature very well.<br /><br />tips for passing emissions:<br />1. check the co with this tool and make it as low as possible without the engine failing, the recommended % of CO by mechanics  for older cars  is too high to pass emissions, at the required level by DMV an older car will run very lean, but that leanness in fuel fixture is required today to pass emissions. if you tune for best performance it will fail emissions.<br />2. ethanol in fuel is very bad for your engine, however it is good for emissions, so before going to a dmv check, it is good to use ahead of time fuel with ethanol for the leaner emissions. Ethanol has  very low lubricity and will damage an engine, but helps lowering emissions, that is why many fuels come with ethanol in it.<br />3. use a clean air filter with low air resistance such as k&n.<br />4. have clean oil in your engine, since some oil flows to the air filter where it is used for combustion, for older engines oil with more viscosity is better.t over time it does not resist the exhaust temperature very well.  tips for passing emissions: 1. check the co with this tool and make it as low as possible without the engine failing, the recommended % of CO by mechanics  for older cars  is too high to pass emissions, at the required level by DMV an older car will run very lean, but that leanness in fuel fixture is required today to pass emissions. if you tune for best performance it will fail emissions. 2. ethanol in fuel is very bad for your engine, however it is good for emissions, so before going to a dmv check, it is good to use ahead of time fuel with ethanol for the leaner emissions.

B000EEU0IO|5|My sister told me she was about to start driving for UBER on the weekends to bring in some cash, the next day this showed up on her doorstep. Apparently though she really loves it so win win
B00ERLM71S|1|Did not look like the picture. Large square pink areas fill the area between the body\neck to the legs. It makes it rather ugly.  I suspect it is a quality control issue. Both of the ones a purchased are like this.
B00OQ1F7PM|4|This works well. I have it hooked up to a boat battery to maintain it. So far, it's great.
B00EECXAY8|4|Worked as expected

B00NON2332|5|:)
B006CPMDBG|1|I thought this would be a cheaper backup key for my Camry. I was surprised to learn when I tried to get it cut and programmed that this key would not work for my car. Something about a letter designation on the key somewhere that I did not know of. Always check before purchase. Wish I could return this
B00IEYDZTC|4|So far they are doing the job. Easy to install .

B0007IJR04|5|This works great. It removed some bad mildew from my wave runner seat, cover,  and life vest with no adverse effects.
B0060A9HDA|5|Great mirror! Easy to install. My side mirror cracked in half, but the rest of the device was fine. When looking for a replacement all I could find was the entire side mirror unit (which was between 50-95) I decide to search on Amazon and figured it would be work it for the prize. It truly was. All I had to do was remove the old mirror and attach the new one with the glue stickers it brought.
B00JVHLS3G|5|Looks great, replaced after  additional pressure. As good as original. Slightly larger for rear decal but fits as well.
B007CN9IJW|5|I had bought plastic one which I wish I never did. I bought these and they are perfect.

B00VSQ5UIM|5|Worked great! Read ABS Code on my '03 Passat and also can be used as a generic OBD II that works with other vehicles. Definitely worth the money.
B001UC9FSU|5|Hose fits as it should.
B00F9RNIPI|5|This is one of the best cables I have ever owned! Great Product!
B00TUKXXDM|4|Cute and fits nice

B00VVEZTZA|5|Cheaper than my local autopart store and fits perfectly in my 2000 Buick Lesabre
B003LTEC0G|4|Works great but you will need to add a resistor if your bike currently has incandescent bulbs.
B000GU7K6Q|5|Product as advertised
B00RILMJBC|1|Fit like crap and the double sided tape is already losing its stickiness after less then a week.
B00429NKWK|4|TIPS.<br />When applying the UV coat/clarifying solution, sandwich a business card between the application cloth to help give even application, and use the whole of the leading edge of the cloth. Don't try to put too much on or it will give a streaky finish. Don't get the feeling you should rush the last stage, don't hang about but also don't drag the application cloth across the headlamp too quickly. If you are not happy with the finish, you can remove it with pure alcohol and try again. but make sure you remove it all, it will take some rubbing off with alcohol and cloth.<br />I removed the first attempt with alcohol, as I got a streaky finish. The second attempt, I used the business card in the cloth, and slowed down. The finish is now perfect.
B000CCFFR4|4|Needed a rack to slide over my ball mount between truck and pop-up.  This unit is built strong &  even comes with locking fasteners.  I feel that this is better suited for 2 bikes even though it claims 3.  Well worth the money.
B000GD5FMY|3|I bought it as a gift for my dad on his birthday last month but unfortunately it's not good enough to please him.
B005H7DRQA|5|Like this product better than others. Seems to enrich deeper and makes the leather seem more supple and last longer.
B00HZ7CC6G|5|A vast improvement over the first and second generations of this item. Made of a much more flexible, less brittle material than the previous two I have installed (including one that was supposedly warranted for a lifetime). This is not an install for the squeamish.
B00S10Q1QS|5|Very good so far .
B000CCFY5W|3|works as described. the adapter that is supposed to drain the antifreeze away from the engine compartment does not fit/work great.
B00DC4RKL8|4|Liked the first one enough to buy a second one.  Worth the price but I would paid more for a heavier duty with a bigger.release button.  Many of us larger size passengers may have trouble accessing the release button.
B008SFAMX4|5|I have a 2008 Spyder with side bags and tour pack.  The cover fit very well and was easy enough to get on the bike.
B008ECDFSK|5|Fit perfectly, easy to install

B00539M0GK|5|well made product!
B001P6GONU|5|Very good product at a great price. Looks nice.
B00QJWUPC6|5|These lights are much better than that o.e.m that were in my current vehicle. Good product. Hopefully they last a long time. Not as bright as Xeon headlights but would not blind other drivers on the road.
B00I548REE|5|easy to install ,,nice step
B000C3DD4K|5|By golly, it works just like it is supposed to do.
B000B8U5Y2|4|Bought it to use on my orbital polisher for cleaning hard vinyl in the car but ended up using it and some ammonia to clean grout lines and built up gook from an unpolished marble floor instead.<br />Worked fantastically! Slight stiffer bristles would have been even better, but it did a better quicker job than aything else I've tried in the past!
B00RMD6QE2|1|It was a rip off even though I paid about $5 it is of only getting into the car . It can not be loaded with a chip and it is only good for getting into the car after going somewhere and getting the key cut. It was a scam, rip off and it was wrong for me to purchase it. Tell others it is a scam to get people to buy this uncut key, Ripped off.
B001FIDNGO|5|Just what was needed to help access my seat belts.
B00A7YTWEE|3|I was pleased with the delivery speed, and I was very excited to try them on however, 1 of the 12 bulbs on the LED board did not light up.
B00PCKXOLK|2|Works. Not as good as a cheaper one I bought earlier.
B001G4S8C6|5|I purchased this carrier to replace one I was having to use a 2&#34; to 1 1/4&#34; adapter on and that sat straight off of the receiver. The old one used to drag the ground on bumps even without weight on it. This Pro Series cargo carrier more than eliminated the issues I had with the old one. The 1 1/4&#34; shank eliminated the adapter and the rise prevented the dragging; the clunking and rattling noises disappeared as well. The side rails are made of high quality steel square tubing that is welded at every joint and offer a load of places to attach straps. The only assembly I had to make was bolting the shaft to the main carrier with the 3 supplied bolts and lock nuts. They bolt through the sides of the under bracket eliminating the bolts from being in the cargo area like a lot of other carriers do. They do recommend torquing them to 70ft/lbs so you may need to have someone assist with that if you don't have one yourself (I had one). The setting is a lot but guarantees the integrity of the connection and the possibility of loosening.
B008MM5ZFI|5|good cleaner I only got one and a third coat out of the can of treatment though...
B002QVU4RK|5|fits perfectly for my 2014 prius
B0016IJ3Z8|5|another correct part at a good price
B00842A7F4|1|Part quality is good but does not fit 2000 Honda Accord Lx Model!! Amazon suggested this part and said it fits apparently it doesn't. Right part is DORMAN 961-037 which is 4$ a piece!!
B002I165SK|5|Top quality plugs. Made my truck run like new again. The others had over 100.000 miles on them.

B00BTLEJAQ|1|I'm sending them back. It said it would fit my 2009 Ford Focus seats but they were too small
B00H7LPKKU|5|Fantastic product, works as or better than advertised!
B00NPYXAWS|2|Arrived scratched and many of the reflective stickers were off. The cutter works but needed a lot of force and sawing motion. I was expecting it to need force but be able to slice through. The rod is not one solid piece which I was also expecting for strength. It appears that way but I can twist the pointed end while the back end is stationary.
B00P8DFA5E|5|Fit perfectly and protect the entire back floor.
B00FG7PJB2|4|Nice, only fault I see is the &#34;Key Ring&#34; can turn and release keys by itself.<br />It has  very weak spring....
B000MUTAGS|5|Does exactly what it was made to do.
B0009V1WS4|5|Really well made.  Works beautifully.  Fantastic buy.
B0064MX7US|5|The local (blue and yellow) auto part store sells the identical solinoid for $29.60. Works exactly as it should and is an all-weather product.
B00996GVB8|5|I love this belt. It clicks and releases well and is fully adjustable. I have other belts in this style that only have 2 adjustments on them. Will have to find and order more :)

B000WJA5ZY|5|Worked for gps on mc.
B002MAEHTG|4|realize this styling accessories looks a little better than a fake, I am pleased.  Was kind of difficult to maintain alignment, took approx four times before I was satisfied. Still nice way to dress up the Cruiser.
B00IMF4484|5|They are a little smaller than I expected, but do the job and are an excellent accessory (very nice looking).

B001650QPC|5|Your product exceed what I paid in cost...  The look n usage is holding up perfectly...  Thx
B006GWVBQ8|5|I have used this product along with the Vinyl sauce for over the past 8 years.  Have found nothing that works better and price is high but if you by the gallon as I do then just refill the spray bottle and much more cost efficient.  Even my father and neighbor uses it now too.
B001GS16VM|1|KTI represents this in their Amazon online product description as a 14mm, but it actually is a 1/2&#34; wrench. Be aware that if you think you are ordering a 14mm, you are actually ordering a 1/2&#34;.
B0038KVOZE|5|Love it. Came filled and works.
B007FTV9Q8|5|This shade is cute and fits well. Even though it is for a larger car, my daughter can fit it well into her smaller car, it folds great aroune the sides. Love the ease of it too! Made well too!
B004PE499A|5|This light has been on top of my truck for two years now. I have never removed it. Not once. It has not budged an inch despite every type of driving, including highway. The lens is still crystal clear, it's as bright as the first day I bought it, and can be seen from quite a distance, even in the daylight. At night, don't look straight at it! Lol. Buy it with ZERO regret.
B00T9AGBOQ|5|I bought this per recommendation of a friend who purchased one to carry on his motorcycle. I was able to put it to good use this past week, when we took our oldest daughter's family to Yellowstone & the Grand Tetons. It did a great job charging up their android & Apple devices. Thankfully I did not have to test it's jump start feature, but have no doubt it will do the job after hearing my friend's testimony of how he used his to jump start his Ford V6 Ecoboost in his Ford F150.
B008KWP7JY|5|Thanks You!!!
B00144CSR4|5|Bought these for my Cargo Trailer.  What good is a tire claw lock on a tandem axle trailer if you don't have a lug nut lock on the rim...  Ooops.  In our area, 80 trailers are stolen every week.  Take it from someone who now knows.  The first lock you buy are McGards, then buy a Abus chain and a Abloy 362 padlock. Then buy a AMPLOCK Coupler Lock.  Without that configuration, your trailer will be a statistic like mine.<br /><br />If you have a tandem (2) axle trailer.  If you put a tire claw on, all the theif has to do is take off the tire, and go.  The hokie coupler locks that are sold on Amazon like the Master Lock Coupler Lock took the thief 6 seconds to angle grind and then pry off the rest of the way.  You need the McGard and the AMPLOCK, ABUS and ABLOY to secure the trailer properly.  All the other locks are just toys.
B000YCCPAW|5|Excellent product with very good installation instructions; very pleased. requires a bit of bending but fit nicely and doesn't rattle.
B000C55YF4|1|The part fit as advertised like original.
B000HM579K|5|This battery switch works great, and is pretty inexpensive. Just a side note, the photo shows the Flaming River logo on the mounting bracket. But on the one I received, there was no logo on the bracket. It was all black.
B008N82D2E|5|HEAVY CONSTRUCTION AND EASY TO KEY OPEN.
B0022ZUYIE|5|I installed this adapter plate on my 1980 GS550 gas tank so that I could retrofit to a manual petcock from the malfunctioning vacuum petcock I had on there. The gasket didn't initially seal good enough to the tank and it leaked a little so I used some RTV to coat the paper gasket and it hasn't leaked since. Be careful not to over tighten the screws! I accidentally broke the head of one off and had to go on a screw extracting adventure. Also, this plate is quite thick and the clearance on the GS550 between the carbs and the bottom of the tank is limited so be sure to choose a compact petcock to install in the plate.
B00B8SZWAQ|5|Very heavy duty screen.
B00HZBAKD4|4|I bought these back in 2014 and put them in a plastic container as spare parts. Just recently started making pigtail assemblys out of them. They are well constructed and molded plug housings. They do not come with any sort of instructions but if you go on youtube.com and type in assemble weather pack connectors in the search bar there is a really good video thats very clear. You will need a special crimping tool for weather pack connectors. I opted for SG tool aid, they had one for $38. Or you can solder the terminals to the wire. Either way you choose, these plugs are decent.
B0026MARWG|5|Just what I needed to get my 4/55 air conditioning working again.
B000X9EGFS|5|This works great I have not had any issues with it. Fills up full size tires easily! I keep them in my tow trucks for work and they work great!
B00JRYHGKC|5|Fits as expected. Fast delivery.
B00BJON9CW|5|Just came in from installing them. Arrived on schedule and the installation was fast and simple. ( it would have been nice if an alcohol swab or two was included!) otherwise satisfied.
B001UFQBAM|5|Good product. Everything that was expected.
B00JJIAYK0|5|Works great!
B00VBK7I7Q|5|great lights
B00U868BN4|5|Good product,and great customer service!!
B00RUQO33M|3|Just right size for gap.
B000EDQR4Q|5|These are a must for any RV and they seem to be very good quality
B003VXRPL0|5|Got it
B003XULXXW|1|It leaked the first time we used it....several of my suitcases and bags got wet.
B001LHVOVK|5|Works great! We purchased to read the codes on our Lexus and it immediately showed us what the problem was, we fixed and have not had check engine light on since!
B002P8T4VQ|5|My girlfriend cannot believe that I bought this through here, Amazon. She switched car with her sister when her sister was still a student and couldn't afford to haver the car fix. So, my girlfriend switched her Sentra for her sister's Maxima. The car was messed up with lots of dents and the biggest problem was the passenger's side mirror because it was broken due to a hit and run while her sister was parked on the mall garage and my girlfriend just used masking tape to put it together and to stay it intact from the base, but as the car moved fast it slowly going down until the next thing you know, it is already hanging from its cords. My girlfriend will still fix it using masking tape and she done it for 5 years now. So, one day, I tried to check if Amazon has some car parts and I am so glad that I did and now her car's passenger's side mirror is back on track. Also, I got this earlier than the estimated arrival date.  It came in a big box with full of bubble plastic to protect this fragile item. It is very easy to install. Nothing bad to say about this. Really good and it looked like it is the original part. Thank you.
B007RHX1I2|5|Good Value.
B0082IZW14|5|love this set it is just what i wanted thanks guys
B000KZ0E3S|5|This remote worked just fine for My Dodge Ram 2005 model. It had to be programmed at the dealer because i had no working fob but that is to be expected if you read up on this fob . Total was 75 including purchase of fob . if you do not have a working FOB it has to be programmed at the dealer no jumper 1 to 4 for 2005 dodge ram 1500 . had two programmed at same time no extra charge.
B00P2D3W00|5|great bulb with super white color. thank you. 👍🏼👍🏼
B000K0WNDC|3|Just these springs and new shocks adjusted my camber 5 degrees out of wack. I was able to install a 3 degree camber kit on the upper ball joints to get things closer but still way off.  I may need a drop bracket for the axle pivot points to get it the rest of the way.
B007N6PT46|5|Very good product very pleased with the purchase
B005OS5EWM|5|Worked great
B002TS2G9Y|5|Great little lights . Will work great on my saddle bags.
B00029KC2K|5|Easy to apply and seems to be doing<br />The job
B005F5IYOE|5|I will only buy from Fowler Volkswagen period. Great prices, fast shipping. First Aid kit is on point, great starter kit. Everything you will need for typical cut bruise.
B000AP1MFW|5|Feel like the engine  ran better than before.
B00L5T6MIE|5|They work nicely
B00CUKXODI|1|Very upset. It was a waste of time & money. I actually lost time & money.
B00ECW2T38|4|These are $30 at HD. It looks good and it makes it easier to get in and out of my truck bed ***Update 07/30/16*** All of the coating came off of the step. The Aluminum is corroded and looks horrible. I took it off, cleaned it up with a wire wheel, primed it and put 2 coats of rattle can bed liner on it. I love the step and can't live without it. I wish the coaring had held up longer.
B00N2D206E|5|Well worth the money
B000C55WYW|2|did not fit
B00PX1OWA0|5|good product for my mower and/or waverunner trailer. Gotta let them air out, Made in China rubber has a bad smell to it. It's cheaper to buy them here than at the store.
B000CNAPP0|5|ok
B003DFIW1S|4|This is the best high-amperage fuse holder I could find for the price.  The few I have seen that appeared to be better made, cost significantly more, and any that I have found at a lower price, were not as well made.  Compared to the 'cheaper' versions, this one has more strands in the wire, a slightly sturdier overall 'feel', and the cap seems to fit tighter than most, leading me to think it will be more weatherproof.  There ARE better ones out there, the best are the ones rated for salt water marine use, but for most any normal use, these are more than good enough, and Amazon had the best price I could find.<br />Note that this takes the big MAXI-sized blade fuses, so don't confuse it with the standard-sized fuze holder.  However, with a 60 amp rating, it will handle quite a load.
B000KFWVN4|5|EXCELLENT. Even if you have to replace filters from time to time. This system works as advertised. To get a spot free wash, filters are worth it. Nothing is free, except my vehicles from those darn water spots.
B000BVRZ74|5|same as in the store, just no need to go to the store.  works well. would recommend.
B00UXO1OTO|5|Great replacement very similar to my 2007 Chevy Silverado new body style's 2 included remotes. Has remote start and seems to have the same extended range as the factory unit (about 200 feet). Very easy to program per the owners manual. HOWEVER, ALL remotes have to be programmed during the procedure. Found this out by programming new one using original. When I tried locking/unlocking with my original &#34;spare&#34; it would NOT work. Did procedure again using original & then original &#34;spare&#34; then this new one and all three now work. It's been a few weeks riding in my pocket and being used. No problems so far.
B002MQCYO0|5|Works great for plastic boat windows. Dries streak free and clear. Works great.
B0037IYLYI|5|Everything work out perfect thanks Amazon
B003E2WQE4|2|Not a great design.  Will not recommend as it needs better fastening points for straps.  Allows bike to wobble too much.
B00NOG0PNO|4|Works fine. The wires are shorter than I thought.
B00DWKZ8BG|5|Love it!
B0023VBW7E|5|Good , product, fast shipping.
B007LPJTFO|5|Looks good on my GMC  SIERRA...
B007NVSEJI|5|runs a bit small, id go bigger as it will adjust by velcro anyway
B00JL7ZSZK|5|It arrived sooner than said and they look great on the truck. They were in perfect condition when they arrived.  Very satisfied.
B008FZAPK2|5|I havent had any problems with this relay. It switches at high frequency without a problem and handles the amperage just as well. Excellent product in my opinion
B00GSAUHB8|3|It gives off a funky odor after being used all day. Hopefully it will go away.
B0010Z4MDK|5|Strong battery, fully charge out of the box, installed in application with no problems. Like the 1/4&#34; terminals -- they accept standard 1/4&#34; fittings available anywhere.
B005OKXGNY|5|These mirrors replace the original ones. I'm well pleased with my purchase.
B00I3K4RXA|4|Useful.
B00EKTILNU|1|one fit well, the other did not, and keeps coming loose from either the top, or the bottom.  I've even used clamps on it for 24 hours with more/new 3m tape...nope.
B001O0CC2Y|3|The chrome looks good and everything, but the Amazon discription did not say that they're small diameter which they are. They still work for my truck but look a little funny. Also, it may be more of a problem with my rusty wheel lug studs but sometimes they don't wont to go on easily. I managed to cross thread one and didn't know it until the stud was ripped right off lol smh fml
B004AIIBQ8|5|Perfect fit, it took seconds to place it in its location, great thanks!
B0007ZHA92|3|I put these on 2 different vans. Both fits and works nice. The included tool is worthless, use your own wrench.<br />These are small and does a good job but I wish I would have bought a bigger one
B00902G1MK|4|Great part, but not for my application.
B00BJCN83Y|5|Ordered these a while ago and just recently got around to using them. Used in one of the step to resurface the plastic headlight housing on a vehicle  and worked great.
B0049Z3M34|5|both worked perfectly no problems took old off cleaned up shaft nice tight fit
B001H529JM|5|This is one of the best cables I have ever owned! Great Product!
B004JO9O78|5|Bring your own mug. Great feel and easy of use. Digging the color to.
B000BYGGZI|5|A great plug for my Geo Metro.  The description is a bit difficult to understand as one might think you are getting 4 plugs when in fact you are getting one, that has four tips on the end of the plug that helps make the plug fire better.  I ordered 4 of these for my Metro and have been very pleased as it runs very well.
B004A30UHG|5|the best replacment
B001MYWBF0|1|It's start function is useless. I've tried jumping two batteries with it and it doesn't work.
B00HLYJWWA|4|Nice solid keychain for the price, but that mask is from Majora's Mask, not Minish Cap...
B000VT5776|5|fit great
B00SI58IJY|5|They definitely stick well and are very good quality!
B00DLB1ORI|5|Great
B00VM3YAJG|4|This helmet is very comfortable but the wind noise is ridiculously loud. So wearing ear buds or  having music is a must.
B00VNNRHBS|5|Item as described. Fast shipping. Thanks
B0033QNZWS|5|Can't get too excited about coolant/ antifreeze.  It arrived undamaged and was as described.
B00QTDRR0S|5|Customer of mine didn't want to spend $165 for an OEM regulator from the dealer so I found this on Amazon and he wanted this instead.  Bolted on perfectly and connector was right as well.  Window went up smoothly and quietly.  Will buy again
B00H6XPZN6|5|Easy to set up small bag for storage i love it!
B00LMRDXAE|5|Great quality
B000C54496|5|Fast shipping great price. Genuine moog brand and fit.
B0023VH5NO|1|Tail light was not good quality.  Out Of shape. Did not fit properly.
B001P2BNNU|5|nice quality
B000GZQ2FG|5|My order arrived in a timely manner. Installed on<br />my bike and have used several times,they are really comfortable. I  really like the way they hug the bike.
B000VB66VK|1|Pump fits properly. The electrical connector is different and I had to make a patch cable from the trucks wiring harness. The pump wouldn't maintain the appropriate pressure because an internal seal/bushing had a tear. I scavenged one from the failed pump and the pump is currently performing properly.
B003LTEC0G|1|They took a long time to get there and they are not very bright.  I'm shopping for a different pair.
B0006I0NU8|3|Smaller than the broken latch to be replaced but serviceable.
B00UIOJEY6|5|I love these license plates..they have a little weight too them,I thought I ordered the plastic one's. .which I didn't want..they are shiney which makes them stand out and give my car a good added look..very pleased with this purchase!
B00CPT1ES6|5|So cute! I love it. Exactly as described. Great honest seller
B00I1FTXI6|4|Good product took a while to be delivered
B005PZMLDY|1|When I purchased this item, it was delivered in a timely manner. However, I was very disappointed because these seat covers do not fit the way they are portrayed in the picture. Furthermore, there were no instructions on how to put the seat covers on. Rather, there was a piece of paper in the package that said to go on some website to figure out how to put the seat covers. I don't recommend this item.
B00C780MOC|5|This Brush/Push bar was installed on a 2004 JEEP Grand Cherokee. It went on fairly easily with just a few tools. It looks and feels heavy enough to do an excellent job. Plus, it looks really good.<br />One thing, and perhaps the seller should correct the picture in the listing. The picture shows 3 lights mounted on the bar. You can mount 3 lights on the bar if you weld another bracket in the center. There are 2 brackets on the bar as shown in light pictures included with this review.<br />I ordered the 2X Cree lights, and wiring kit, (separate reviews) for this bar.<br />Well pleased......
B00IXF8K9C|5|Very pleased with Repair Clinic & mud flaps purchase.  They arrived much sooner than predicted.
B00BONEOQS|3|Locks stick if parts move while driving. Needs to have a better locking system
B00K53CARS|3|works great kids are happy
B004JBYX9A|5|Fit perfectly on my 01' Boxster S.
B00L1EKGBM|4|Very easy to install, took me less than 20 minutes.
B008Q9X4EQ|4|Everything was good but it could have been shipped faster that's all
B000KKXTRQ|1|Not the correct part for a 2004 Lincoln LS.
B00LOE032G|4|Looks and sounds gd just could have been louder then it is. Can't really hear it blow off like it should.
B000CNGU86|5|ok
B00K9BEAOM|3|It's not an incredibly high-quality sticker, but the color is vivid, and it seems to stick well.
B00MG0P0PW|5|Great quality! Easy to place.
B00J5BPMA8|5|perfect  - 2006 escape 4 cyl code light never came back on.
B003H79IPG|5|It's the St Petersburg Florida flag alright 😃 good quality shipped super ridiculous fast
B001VYX3DU|5|Works good under the carport,but not sure if it will last outside
B0055AIE4Y|5|Very satisfied
B00GOFJNJY|5|Looks amazing and applied easily!
B005GRGOGG|5|Why mess with coils, points, condensers, and all that when this bad boy does it all? I swear that the spark is hotter by far with this unit.<br />I messed up and got the motor 180 degrees out- but after correcting that, engine lit right off. I thought I got a bad unit after connecting the<br />tach - but the tach was shorting out the distributor. Great stuff.
B000T9YKAS|5|Love it just what I have been looking for works great
B006H34BUY|4|I was able to clean the interior of my car. Spotless clean<br />A must have to all cars
B003BZZC7W|4|I bought two of these seat belts to attach to my mobility scooter for lifting into my van.  The rigging works great.  These are easy to engage and easy to release.
B007O5GWV0|5|Works well
B00JHEG85Q|4|Must buy
B0009NWQWI|4|I LOVE this bag. I needed an exterior storage solution for my new SUV with no roof rack. I bought the clips and they worked wonderfully. There was no damage to the paint and they held the bag in place for 2,14 hour trips traveling at 70-80 mph. The exterior strap should have loops to feed around the bag, but with a little adjustment, it held fine. Packing for 4 people and 2 dogs equalled about 200 lbs. After reading previous reviews I knew I had to place something flat in the bottom so I put a boogie board in there! It was the perfect size & added no weight.<br />The ONLY problem I had with the bag was that I got pulled over and given a warning ticket for no light for my license plate ( I was traveling at night) So that is a MAJOR concern for when/if I'll use it again. Overall, a great product, just needs a few tweaks.
B00QEC0ANA|5|They look great on my 2nd Gen Colorado!
B00NAB1PVO|5|Great price! Shipping was decent. Love the product
B00T6VT5VO|5|This is a good quality lanyard.  It arrived in a timely manner and is fully functional.
B0084LT79M|5|Wish I had bought it sooner.  I had chips in the acrylic finish on the front of my Armada.  It was going to cost $400 to repaint the hood.  I ordered this put it on in about 15 min. and it completely covered up the chips.  No screws or holes just a great strip of adhesive. I have been through the car wash several times no problems.  Just my bad that I did not get it sooner.
B0016KA8GE|5|Top Quality! Great Look! Well Made!
B001P2H140|4|Just buy the better/brighter bulbs like everyone recommends.
B00S8KQAUS|4|Looks and fits great. Made a little cheap but good for the price
B00P022BDM|5|Hangs my suit jacket perfectly and great price!
B0002SQZPY|5|Yep. What he needed
B000ETUD22|5|I could never find a decent spacer to use when installing small wheel studs. I always ended up damaging the nut which the wrong tools
B00ACDP6YU|5|It does the job as it should at a fair price.
B000CQBG82|5|perfect
B00SU3UK04|5|priced at $260.00 at Toyota, I paid about $35, install at toyota was $200, I installed it in about 30 minutes,,, I paid Toyota $60 to program it as I could not get the light to go out,, they had problems and it took them several hours but only charged me for 1 hr
B005CTIINA|5|love it.
B00A7GE5YE|5|Fit like a glove
B002BHWZFI|1|Bad, did not work as intended
B0014TMVF8|5|Purfect for 1994  Cutlass Supreme Convertible
B00MU5X17M|5|Good fit
B00SKFY62K|5|Good doing biz with you
B005NLQAHS|5|Works great, and super compact. I just keep it the top compartment on my trunk toolbox so I have it wherever I go. Has come in handy several times at several places where I would've never had a full-size OBDII tool with me.
B00KN1T4M6|5|Great
B003SG431U|2|I am disappointed with these seat covers. I loved the material and look of them when I got them out of the package, and bought them because Amazon said it would fit my Ford 04 Explorer, but alas, it didn't fit at all. One seat cover was too tight, the other was too lose and had a bubble in the middle. The headrest covers are also too big and bubbled as well. Really bummed about this.
B000JZ5A88|5|Good item, fast delivery. Super seller +++++AAAAA
B008535CTS|4|Easy to mount and modify to fit existing supports.  Fabric quality fair to good.  Expect three to five years service.  Not bad for the price.
B00IEFXWEE|3|I Installed this into my 2008 Mercury Sable Premier. Let's just say, they weren't the most cooperative company I've ever had the opportunity of dealing with. This product is NOT designed for my vehicle and I was aware of this when purchasing. I specialize in automotive electronics. I have access to iDentiFix, an online resource for diagrams and everything else you could every imagine for nearly every car manufacturer. I've spent the time to figure out their entire wiring harness and mine. All I wanted to do was submit a &#34;Alternative Minor-Mod&#34; option to allow more vehicles to match the same application. NOPE. DAMN CANUCKS.
B001GH5PRE|5|Fits great on badlands 12,000 lbs
B0055DMY4W|5|Very Nice
B00DBEN5BS|1|Not what I expected it all! Not bright it all! The original ones done better so I put them back in.
B000CQ4DK0|5|Works well... sometimes, need to use more grease to press out old stuff and keep consistency.
B005OK2L94|4|Very good
B00DD27KPK|5|Part was just as described.  They did a great job getting me all the parts after UPS only delivered the tire.  I appreciated them taking care of it quickly.
B00BBWBQGS|5|Perfect fit, and these are absolutely great!<br /><br />The only downside is that I can't take off my shoes in the car anymore because the plastic has hard-lines that my feet don't agree with. ;)
B0075JJ4V0|5|Great detail
B00ELBCSZY|5|These work great on our 2006 toyota Tundra
B000C2SB70|5|Perfect fit for Ford 1998 F150 with 4.6L
B001S8IF1Y|5|Was perfect, had same markings and stickers as factory one I replaced, and had a much lower price!
B0009IQU5M|5|Fram is the only product i will use on my cars.They work great.
B001KPL4G8|3|The instructions and talking to Curt the Manufacturer, indicated that installation would be simple, but I had to TA{P (re-drill ) all of the holes to make it work.
B003V18MJG|5|Great product, everything works great!
B000WJX6IM|3|I've used it twice now when washing my bike. I must be a bit harder to impress than others, but maybe I was expecting too much from it after reading other reviews. I will not be purchasing another bottle of it after it's used up...
B0018ICAMO|5|Just what we needed
B00IABEV6A|5|Another fine Roadmaster product....recommended.
B0095FBDTS|5|It is what is says, it's the latest Motul that carries the newer gen Mercedes 229.5 motor oil. The Bottle has an internal pouring spout that pops up and out when you twist and open the top. Extremely nifty design so don't really need a funnel. No complaints about this oil. 1.8T Engine is running quieter and well.
B00A0GN3R6|5|Purchased this for my son.  He loves it.  Now he can keep up with his keys easier than before.  Would recommend for any new driving teens.
B00551B62K|5|Fit and worked perfectly on my 1976 Evinrude 90 HP V4.
B002P8WYRC|5|Fit good
B00IIWG0OC|5|Got these for my 2006 Honda Pilot.  This, plus a YouTube video or two on how to do it, very easy.  Shipped timely, all is good a couple of months post installation.
B001P2DTY6|5|Easiest installation. Took less time than suggested. Purchased for 2008 Honda Element. Works great. Price is less that Uhaul charges and you save the $72 installation chg because of easy installation.
B00RW1MEWW|5|Great hd cover. Waterproof
B0023VF5M2|5|It was a perfect fit
B003ZWHMGU|5|Good value and quality
B0006SU3QW|2|It is a great item, but it is much Cheaper at Walmart! Save yourself some money people!
B00O07DGKK|5|Not much to say, it does it job!!!
B008CE0W5Y|2|2 stars for the price only...do not buy if you're wanting waterproof lights...the right light was waterproof however the left light was totally different...the left light had a clear plastic cover on the bottom that had gaps leading straight to the inside...i had to use plastic bond to fill in the gaps...now the leds looked like they had a plastic coating on the circuitry but the side light is a normal bulb and would short out as soon as it hit water...other than that they're pretty good light...i would recommend only using them on regular trailers not boat trailers if thats how they come.
B0084RGH3K|4|The was a good replacement.  Quality was good.  After removing the old part and mounting the new part the engine was about 3 inches away I used a ratcheting belt attached to the front of the engine and frame of car to move the engine in place to attach the strut mount.
B00HJLWXKS|5|Great buy
B001UFN9TS|3|Purchased one on 7-28-15. Installed it the same day. It took only about 5 minutes to install and seemed like a decent design. After several days the lid came off and I found that the hinges were merely plastic tabs. I have my doubts as to their longevity as we all know the more you bend plastic quicker it will fail. The lid still wants to come apart from the tabs and I have to keep reinstalling it.<br /><br />The lock is covered by a small tab that is spring loaded  to keep it down and keep dirt and water out. After 8 days of use I found a spring and detent laying on the floor of my truck and the tab was no longer spring loaded.<br /><br />While the unit is handy and will continue to use it, I won't purchase another unit of this nature unless it's all metal and is made tougher than this one.
B00R4WFRKK|1|It said it would fit a tl1000r last week when I ordered it. Now it says nothing of that sort. And sure does not fit. It did get here quickly.
B0080HJL7S|5|I received this trash bag for free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion. As long as I've owned cars I have bought various types of trash bags and this sits at the top of my list of favorites. That is because of the metal bracing at the top of the bag hat helps to hold the bag open or closed along with a Velcro closure. The bag I had in my car before I received this I just hate, it is closable as well via Velcro but has no framing to it at all and it is just a limp mess. I often find that I think I put something in it only to find that because of the limpness it has fallen out and onto the floor. I'm always fighting to squash things back into it that it in turn dumps back out because of the limpness of the bag. I am finding that with the frame at the top of this I am no longer fighting my trash and the bag and it is all staying inside.<br /><br />I also like that it is liquid proof inside, with the plastic lining if your kids toss in unfinished beverages it will not drip out like other garbage bags that are not lined. Also since it is lined it is much easier to clean should someone toss something sticky, wet or gross inside. My other trash bags got tossed out when that happened because they were a canvas type material that didn't clean up very easily or well. My hope is that this bag will last me long into the future!<br /><br />Lastly I like that the strap on this bag is adjustable. I actually have a garbage bag hook in my front passenger seat foot space that this strap can easily hang off of for easy driver and front passenger access. I also have a minivan so the strap can be used to hang the bag off of any of the seat backs around the headrest so that the kids and their friends can also access the trash during longer trips. The adjustable strap will make it easy to move around the van as needed.
B000C0YR1G|5|Very well made and solid pulley.  I like the metal construction vs all the plastic ones you see now days.
B004MAF47S|5|Great
B00IK4CUHE|5|Better then OEM
B00AIW4E48|5|Just what I was looking for, my 3 dachies love it to, it is way nicer than I expected, it is very cool..
B000EBKG9A|5|Great product. I was referred this product and brand name to help with heating costs and sun coming into the house through doors with windows and windows in general. Large roll can be cut into any shape, and comes with tools to help do that.
B003ZALGGO|5|I love this spray and the smell i will buy more soon!!!!
B00BY2220O|5|♥️
B004ULDFA2|3|One of the black bolts have already popped off. Not happy about that. Also I thought they were the kind that screw on to my lug nuts. But they're just attached to thevhub cap itself.
B00CXAC5MG|5|Works good.  Feels well made but haven't used it.  Bought for just in case.
B00ECHLOZC|5|They are of high guality and fit perfectly,  made a wonderful difference for me, im 6'3&#34;
B00C5RBRA8|5|Best hose I have ever owned.  Quality, well built.  Only thing that sucks is because the fittings are attached, I can't store it in my abs pipe I built for my old hose.  The fittings are removable, but it a pain and you risk breaking them.  I store it in a rubber made bin with locking lid.<br /><br />I totally  recommend this hose and hose system.  I can't wait for this hose to fail so I can buy their extreme rhino hose kit.  That thing looks even more awesome.  Wish I would have bought it.
B00CEMRPGE|5|Replaced ugly amber side markers with these and love them. They compliment my upper and lower grills for a clean and custom look. Don't wait, easy installation, buy now
B0002SRF4O|1|Pure junk
B00KTI9UQ8|1|Orderd one for my 2006 Silverado. Tried several times and could not get it to program. I followed directions included and I have programmed many others with different vehicles no problem. Looking at and comparing the electronics inside the fob with the factory one and it's obvious they are two different key fobs.
B000CQOIQ4|4|Good product. Should be a little bit longer
B00651CBO6|5|Awesome antenna, very sturdy, yet flexible. No lose of frequency pick up. I put this on my Ford F 150, 2012 XLT. Easy to install. Made very well.
B007FGR852|5|FIT GREAT, NO INSTRUCTIONS
B00DQJ9GWU|1|So even thou this was very nice looking on my truck I took it off since I tend to listen the radio which means I got very a poor signal with this antenna.  This is for cosmetic looks only.
B000C5I6H2|4|good to go
B0015GPQX4|2|I wish it stood like it does in the picture. I filled the base with coins from my truck, but its still floppy.
B00AAVMUPW|4|My first review comment is on the delivery service from Amazon. I had wished for a (2) day delivery w/ my Prime membership, but was informed it would be more like (5) days. Amazon stepped up the delivery schedule which allowed the battery to arrive in the time I needed it. Thank you Amazon. The packaging protected the battery very adequately during shipping. This battery was selected due to the higher CCA starting amps and being an AGM design. Once installed the cranking power was very evident from that of the factory installed AC Delco battery.The integrated handle makes for a much easier lifting and placing on to the battery tray of our vehicle. The mounting tabs, molded into the case, had to be trimmed in order for the OEM mounting block room to secure the battery to the tray. This was easily accomplished with a sharp razor knife. In several months, the winter season will provide a good test of the cranking capacity during low temperatures. As with any high quality battery, I have high expectations for battery life and performance.
B00NLN4CZC|4|These make my bike look amazing.the only downfall is that they fit a little loose but not enough that they don't work. I'm a bit of a perfectionist but overall they look and work good. I ride a 2013 ZX6R 636
B00HX526CU|1|Worked fine, then the on /off switch stopped working.  Have to take battery out to shut off
B00B49YGAG|4|Replaced the front bearings on my g35 sedan with these. Thought my bearings were bad because of a humming noise when traveling 40-60mph. Old bearings were really rusty but ended up being good still. Still swapped them with these since I had everything apart. Seems to be a good oem replacement product regarding fit and finish even though they were made in china. Will update if anything come up. The humming noise ended up being my cheap no name tires that came with the car...
B00OU67Z80|5|I rarely review items but this spot light exceeded all expectations.  I use it for sailing at night and this light can illuminate buoys at 400 yards.  I could not believe it.  Excellent build quality.  All the other spotlights I have owned have had &#34;disposable&#34; quality and weak performance. I have not had this one long but it looks like it will hold up.
B003BZD08U|4|Like
B000CNB2BQ|5|2001 F-350 PS  4x4 worked great. Very easy to do with basic tools other than a press. I used a friends press and it was the best way to do it.  It took about 30 minutes and made my truck handle much better than the wore out factor bushings.  Looks like they will last a long time.  I used mobile 1 grease on everything that would or could touch metal. The instructions are no help but thanks to google I found how everything fit back together.
B001UOPRS0|5|brief:  awesome stuff.  it actually works and can actually get out deep cigarette smells that have been baked into the cloth upholstery of a car for years.  but... your car will smell like chemically baby powder for at least a week.  after that, you'll have good, normal clean air/smell in your car.<br /><br />advice: &#34;what you get out (the result), depends on what you put in (labor and care invested).&#34;  this life saying is so true.  i bought a 4 year old used car.  days after i settle on the price with the dealer, i went to pick up the car.<br /><br />details: when i got to the lot, the car windows were all rolled down, and the sunroof wide open.  but, being this was only the 1st time i ever really bought a car solo, i suspected nothing.  drove the car home for an hour, no problem.<br /><br />days later, i finally figured out why the dealer rolled down all the windows... horrible smoke smell.<br /><br />so, i talked to some car friends and mechanics.  i was told that you can't get the smell out, have to spend hundreds and go for ozone cleaning, or a deep cleaning.<br /><br />bs, or they didn't know what they were talking about.<br /><br />i bought this 10 dollar can, took all mats out of car.  vacuumed EVERYthing and everywhere in my car.  wiped down everything with scented baby wipes; i used baby wipes because i was sure that was safer to use than chemicals like bleach or chlorox wipes.  then, i sprayed or &#34;fired&#34; this odor bomb everywhere: under the front seats, aimed at the head liner, into seat backs.  i raised, lowered, tilted, reclined front seats and still aimed everywhere that was exposed.  even pushed this stuff into the air vents (months later, no problems).<br />then, i shut the doors, windows.  stepped out, sprayed the bomb stuff one more time as i was outside the car with one door open.  then, just threw the can in the car, left it alone overnight.<br /><br />when i got up, the cigarette smell was gone... but there was an even worse smell.  my best description really is that it smelled like very strong chemicals... but like &#34;metallic baby powder&#34;.  i know this makes little sense... but that's what i really smelled like.<br /><br />yes, it did smell worse than the original cigarette smell.  might have been worse that even more potent cigars.<br /><br />so, for the next week, when i turned on the car, i put the ac on and turned off recirculate mode.  i wanted to get rid of the odor bomb smell so badly and quickly - so i wanted to draw in air from the outside.<br /><br />whenever i drove, i tried to drive with the windows open, sunroof open.  even when i parked overnight or for a days work fro 9 to 5, i left the rear windows a little open, and my sunroof tilted up.<br />secret might be to get a lot of air flow post bomb spraying.<br /><br />when i could i would even roll down all the windows and open all the doors.  wanted maximum wind and air flow to enter the car.<br /><br />about 1 week later, odor bomb and cigarette smell gone.... and i couldn't be happier with my neutral, clean, natural air clothe upholstery car.  would definitly buy again... and wouldn't have done much of anything differently.<br /><br />summary: I THINK THE TRICK is to vacuum and or wipe everything down with baby wipes, spray this odor bomb everywhere, close all windows, let the car sit overnight.... then air out as much as possible.
B000C7WOE6|5|ok
B007B856YY|4|3 star product, average quality, but at such a bargain price I added a half star.  3.5 stars round up to 4.<br />They don't come with a wiring diagram, but the two silver spades are for the power in/out, and the copper colored one needs to be connected to the ground if you want the little light to come on when the switch is turned on.<br />Probably what I like best about them, is how close to flush they mount, they don't stick proud of their mounting surface much more than 1/8 inch or so.  I can't see anything snagging on them, or switching them on or off by accident.<br />To mount, you simply drill the appropriate sized hole (sorry, forgot to measure but I think it is in the specs), press it in from the front (it self-locks into place), and connect the wires.<br />One thing of note, these switches use the NARROW spade connector (10 amp max) , and not that standard spade connector.(15-20 amp)
B000JKDTEA|5|ok
B00029J3U2|5|Worked exactly as described.
B008S2XJF0|5|Good product on time delivery
B00BT7973Y|5|Great deal. Sent in the color code. Part matched the color of my car exactly.
B007OX6E3S|4|It works, could probably find a cheaper version to do the same thing but hey.
B00DI3DV6G|1|Quality is very low
B00MQ5Z5F2|3|Excellent product! Nice price! Good business!
B00BER2SQ2|5|Check valve. It worked great!
B00B2PXY3W|4|PERFECT fit but sides walls to second row mat does not hug the side like the rest (a bit flimsy).  Mats are light but very durable.  Overall winner!
B008HITALM|5|It does it's job. Is anything else required?
B004RIPGW8|1|Does not stick to the surface of my bike, I used a different adhesive and then it began to fade within a week, spend the small amount of money and buy quality, this item is no recommended unless you plan on showing off for 1 day
B00D99ZWW0|4|This fit our F150 decently. It wasn't the best fit, but much better than the universal fit.
B007QV1B36|5|Just fine
B0028JQYSS|3|it's a jack but I'll see how long it lasts
B00L81X6OM|5|Monster mats are a must for GTI owners. Save your oem carpeted mats. These look better and keep your interior cleaner by trapping sand and dirt.
B000BQW5LK|5|worked perfectly. pumped gear oil with no problem
B004GCUBIY|5|Fit perfectly
B0015OENWG|5|Exactly what I order! Looks great!
B00252MA40|5|Easy  to  install  and  perfect  fit
B000CCDLAW|5|Every race car we build we slap on of these on. We use fuel cells and together with the sender, they work perfectly. Never a problem.
B00XAZVJ9S|5|Good quality and direct fit
B00GWFOKYO|2|2 have quit in last couple days, not a good fit and very dim. Even turning 180 only some work.
B00702K4IY|5|Great fit for my 325is little different than stock leather wrapped shifter but looks clean. Delivery was kinda slow bout 10 days from order date.
B00029XD80|1|Don't waste your money. Buy a new lens.
B000WJAH5M|5|It first he grips didn't feel right but after a while oil from my hands filled the sponge like part of the grips so they are now soft and smooth.
B004ZF39T0|3|I started having problems with these lights 6 months after i purchased them. One stide would work the other would work whenever it wanted to. Kinda pissed me off. So i ripped them out and put regular bulbs back in.. kind of disappointed
B0085XKIW4|5|Very please thank you it fit great easy to install
B0043WKX76|5|Exact fit. Perfect
B000E3DU9G|5|installed on 2001 ford f350 PS 4x4 with leveling leaf springs . They work great.
B001JT5HBS|5|Great cleans everything, I'm a construction working and get everything muddy. This product removes old stains and hard to clean spots....
B000RFUF12|5|This is a must have if you have an electric golf cart. Filling the batteries is quick, easy and clean. Highly recommended!
B000BPOI98|5|Great spark plug. Idle is nice and smooth
B002N5W8Q4|4|so kay
B000JG21I4|5|I sit on the computer about 16 hours a day (between work and play).  I also lift weights.  All of these things combined have given me bad extension problems in my wrists.  I have tried the normal braces with the metal brace under the wrist/palm and wraps but nothing comes close to how good these work for me.<br /><br />First thing that I really like like about them is the openness.  My hands and wrists will sweat and not having something covering the thumb area and palm helps to keep them cool<br /><br />Second thing is not having a ball or jell pad on my palm.  This is especially great for mouse control.  More precision movement and now i'm able to reach the extra buttons on the side of my mouse.<br /><br />For weightlifting I have wrist wraps (really cheap ones) and I am fine with those because I go through a lot.  I also sweat a lot when lifting.  I just don't want to ruin these but I would definitely use them if I had a second pair.
B000C3F370|5|ok
B00BCRMB34|4|They do exactly what I wanted them for and fit really well too. I have a 12 Honda Accord and they look like they were made for my car! Wonderful buy!!
B00JSY15JE|5|Love it
B00MX3MP5A|5|Although the shipping takes a little long, the product and price point are perfect. I have a 2009 beetle and it fit my key perfectly!
B000HLO7QA|4|Used this multiple times now, works great.  Adjustment is easy but it would be nice if there were more clear instructions for the &#34;noobs&#34; out there as far as where you should have this set at and how you can find the right setting.  I found that if you are driving down the road and you see some sway, hop out and give it a half crank until you done see the thing sway anymore.
B0076BK9M0|4|I've purchased 2 of these so far.  The passenger side tends to sag, creating a crease.
B00W5MG8XY|1|I wanted this for my road bike.  It doesn't appear to read pressures above 99.5psi given the limits of the xx.x display.  Upon reading my bike tire which I had just filled to 105psi it read 68psi.  It doesn't directly read Presta valves as suggested by a customer Q&A, you need to screw on an adapter every time, which is very inconvenient.
B00JDSO1HI|5|I have used Hide Food on all of my leather items including car interiors and furniture for many years. It is an excellent product. The cleaner is also affective when needed. The product is expensive but it will last for a long time.
B00P3IAYSC|5|Best ever
B00EGDV5S8|5|Great quality bought it for my grandson so that he can put it on his skate board.  Very durable.
B001BXKLNQ|5|simple connection for 6 circuits.  very exposed main contact- you might want to insulate it after hookup.
B00SX5RSA4|5|Very good
B000C6KLO2|5|Fit my 1991 Festive just great.  Works great and car runs fantastic
B002FY8G28|5|fits very good  looks awsome
B00TQ9L23A|4|These are nice covers. They are lightweight, stretchy and the images are an accurate representation on what you will get. They fit snuggly on the front part of the seat, but have a lot of stretch on the back so it should fit most seats. I put them on a 2015 Mitsubishi Outlander. The are pretty thin, so there is no way to tell right now how long they were last but the price is reasonable enough that I feel I will get my monies worth.
B003VAPKHE|4|A+
B007OZ5OKK|1|Only last for a few seconds and then smell was gone. Would not purchase again!
B0031T5S4A|1|Will not fit 97 Mazda b2300 like they claim
B00RFUS6TU|2|MY FAULT - FROM CHINA - LONG TIME TO GET AND SMALL
B000J15THO|5|Used this in the rear differential in a Jeep to stop the slop and gear noise that was going on back there, so far so good, caught the sound early and added this until it was running out, just a top off, seems to work well and has the additive already needed for my make and model diff.
B000O3U2UQ|5|Works good easy to use and tells you just how good your battery is.
B005EA2KLS|4|When installing, make sure you leave the inner frame side loose while you put the knuckle side in the pinch point! If you tightened the frame side first, it will pull the rod taunt and prevent you from pounding the knuckle side in all the way leaving it too low inside the rim! I found this out the hard way and punctured a RIM due to this. I had to reinstall the above way and things are spaced fine now. Be cautious!
B001G7CV6M|5|great product! had it installed in my 1999 toyota corolla a month ago and it fix like a glove. so far no leaking issue.
B00K5527EW|5|As expected
B001FAO8I4|1|Used twice and the threads stripped from hose to pump body.  Complete waste of money
B00YE5Q132|5|[[VIDEOID:a988a63f5107a6d197e70e4a2c3d7e8c]] Never get stuck with a dead battery again with this 12,000mAh 400Amp battery jump starter set from DB Power.<br /><br />If you find the video and review helpful...please hit the YES button below this review. Thanks!<br /><br />Being stuck in a dark parking lot at night with a dead car battery, waiting over an hour for roadside assistance is a scary prospect. That is why having the security of the DB Power jump start external battery is worth its weight in gold!<br /><br />This battery is solidly built. Fit and finish is top notch. The kit comes with a set of jump starter cables that you attach to your dead battery. The red light on the jumper cables will turn green, and you start your car. Super easy. This device is rated at 400 amps peak power, and at 12,000mAh, you should get multiple jump starts from one charge. I set a calendar reminder in my phone to make sure I check the charge of this every two months.<br /><br />There is also two 2amp outputs built into this device that provides charging power for your phone or tablet. There is also a built in LED light that is very handy, as well as a compass. Moreover, this Jump starter with built-in AI technology can deliver the power intelligently once you connect the power cord and clamps on to the car, so you can directly trigger the engine button to jump start the car without pressing the ON/OFF button.<br /><br />This DBPower product is super solid, and works great. I have also communicated with the manufacturer, and they truly listen to the feedback of their users, and I was told they are working hard to include the accessories I mentioned above.
B000WJEPCI|5|Good quality, does what it suppose to do, very satisfied with this item
B00RKIE7FO|5|complete package , ready to install or replace an old unit and functions as advertised
B0040MGZV2|5|Perfect fit fast delivery
B004VNKF9I|5|These have been on my helmut for four months now. Super easy to apply with a little planing. Very reflective when hit with lights, which is what I was going for with a flat black lid.. it's better to be seen than sorry..
B00BC372EG|5|Looks and fit great. A gift for my love!
B00498ZQP8|5|Moog quality and much cheaper than any local parts house.
B007OW6IEE|5|Fits a 2002 4Runner perfectly. It's the real deal. Genuine Toyota part. Works great so you can hang your gas cap on the gas door instead of having to place it atop the car or gas pump while fueling up. You'll never lose your gas gap with the leash. Seems like a fair price.  Solid construction.
B00D7Y4ZTS|5|Mahle is always a trusty brand to stick with.
B005EMK03G|3|Cheap. But offers hanging storage. Used on my roll bar in rear, as was in way on back of seat.
B000F09CF4|5|Amazing stuff. Indispensable around the shop,
B000C9QBHA|5|Perfect fit for the Corvette C7 Z51 dry sump tank.
B000NHUKJG|1|Cable looks great,  but doesn't work with my scan gauge 2, if I could find a wiring diagram I could crimp the rj45 and probably get it to work.  I routed my original cable into my car but wanted to scan all the other vehicles on the farm.  So until I can fix it I'm not happy with the product.
B001RK54EY|5|I like the fact I can turn off the exhaust when I am driving on the highway, I leave the exhaust open at all other times.
B0045JYUY4|3|The cross bars are okay, but as other users have said, the threading on the bolt holes is a little rough, I just powered through torquing the bolts--seemed like they had to help cut the threads.  The company we bought from APGONLINE was great!  If I could rate just the supplier responsiveness and support it would be 5 stars: there was a few parts that did not get threaded in the original package, and we were getting to leave for vacation in a few days and they were able to express mail the parts before we left.  Thank you APGONLINE.  Katy
B002SE1G9U|5|Great product, easy install, looks great !
B00L4J5UPQ|5|This little antenna is awesome!! I can't believe that I had such terrible reception to AM/FM, and replacing the stock antenna with this fixed the problem. The Stubby Jr works splendidly; Wouldn't have guessed it for its size.
B004UPZXQM|5|THIS STUFF IS AWESOME
B00O925ZF0|5|nice
B000KZ09H4|5|Great product
B0080F9G0C|5|Very nice little kit for my son's 07 Accent w/automatic.  Kit came with everything you need, installed pretty simply (about 2 hours) and works like a champ.  I love the fact that Rostra is made in the USA.<br /><br />My chief complaints are the directions themselves...  they tell you to find the blue wire behind the gauge cluster, but never tell you how to get that apart.  You'll need Google or Youtube to figure out how to get to that blue wire.  That's really nitpicking though, as the whole kit appears to be very well thought out and everything fits nicely where it's intended.<br /><br />I mounted the actual cruise control handle a little too high; it's hard to see it when it's mounted.  I put it at about 9 o'clock and really should have done about 730...  my son will have to memorize the set/resume functions as you really can't see them when driving.  It's correctable if I pull the whole thing back apart, but no we didn't feel it was that big of a deal.  But something to keep in mind when you install yours.
B000182DUG|5|Great product! Worked exactly as I hoped.
B008XNZZ7O|2|regular
B004I12438|5|This was a perfect repalcement for my broken tail light. It arrived very quickly and was easy to install myself; and the price was 1/2 the price of the local parts stores.
B000I1KJT8|3|Was disappointed that they do not close tight enough for the small clamps on my garden tractor. They are nice quality though.
B000C9FV3K|5|Can't beat the savings!
B00SWMM7BI|5|Sturdy and very reliable. Durable. And for the price you can't beat it
B0066RWYIM|5|Perfect fit, easy to install.
B0058BNFIK|5|Exactly what we needed!
B000ZZWNYG|5|Sprayed on a pitman arm that would not move with puller... next day, came back and arm was hanging lose with puller.
B000IYAZYY|5|xlnt fit no problems
B001IXZOJU|5|Access is via passenger fender well. Once you drop the filter, cover the top with Saran wrap so you can rotate it 90 degrees to get it out with dumping oil everywhere. It is really tight to remove on the 2013+ model trucks, but worth the effort to save you some money.
B000NSATSM|5|Easy to install. Took about 10 minutes. Perfect match too.
B00WVJR0D8|4|Nice upgrade for the price. Significant improvement over the halogen light on my Harley... Not as effective as the &#34;Daymaker,&#34; but for the price, well worth it...
B00T6J9TL2|5|For great looks great
B000GKB0FS|5|Just what we wanted!
B000AL8VD2|5|Great price on this product and the result is a very efficient installation and prolonged engine life.
B0026FCGEU|5|Great thing to have when another sled in the party has engine problems.
B000HZUXNW|5|Bought it for my family's long road trips up and down the East coast. Holds lots of things for kids to do. When it isn't full of their stuff it will hold large road map books.
B00Y1HT2ZC|2|Worked for the first few weeks then they just stopped. Unfortunately  they stopped working right after the amazon return guarantee so we are stuck with it. We ended up tossing them so it wasn't a great purchase for us.
B00EJPOQRU|1|worked fine out of box but died completely within in about a month. tried recharging and will not hold a charge anymore
B000RXWGIY|5|Works Great
B008I2GY7A|5|Shipping was prompt, needed two bottles for my 04 gtp but other than that good quality
B008TECLSI|5|Works Great
B009DIWHJW|5|Love this filter quality, price, and value. Equal to its higher priced competition.
B0023UUFGY|5|Love the scent, but cant find it anywhere now.  Seems to linger a long time.  Hope they have it again soon.
B000I4JPZE|5|Made changing tire easy great product
B00MWNZ1E8|1|I purchased these wiper blade the end of Dec. 2014, it is now I little over 7 months and they need to be replaced. I won't buy these again.
B00XWVYSXY|5|I love the car seat covers!  They stay on the seat great with no hooks or cords.  They're always cool, even on a 90degree day.
B00KTHYAUU|5|Great product easy to use great seller
B00PCEG7A6|4|Was a little difficult getting into track and preventing window from hitting shade. But otherwise pretty good
B0088HZYJO|5|Every thing that I expected. I had to email the company to get what color I wanted and my request was honered. These are very bright lights and well worth the money.
B00I7EM4DM|1|The product description claim this part is compatible with 08790-2H000A air filter. But actually it is bigger than the original Hyundai 08790-2H000A air filter. It's too big to be installed to my 2013 Hyundai Elantra. I want to return it, but the shipping cost is virtually same as the price of the filter already. Waste of money due to the incorrect product description.  ****** If you are looking for low cost cabin air filter for 2013 Hyundai Elantra, I recommend  &#34;Premium Guard PC5660 Cabin Air Filter&#34;. It is also low cost and it fits my 2013 Hyundai Elantra perfectly.
B00BOEN7WE|4|Fits very well and doesn't get caught under the pedals. I thought the rims would be slightly higher to hold water in better, but they are flat. Still good mats.
B00ONGYDT6|1|doesn't even come close to fitting a 2010 Toyota Tundra SR%
B00094I1SA|5|this is my second one and I keep on giving them away before I can get them put up, but I just love their convience and they take up very little space.
B00ARJPY0K|5|The part worked perfectly on my Mercedes Benz C220 1995.  It was easy to install and a perfect fit.
B00M1X6F9Y|5|Fit the Category 1 on a john Deer 750.  Pins were included.  Solid, welds look good, and heavy.  I just installed it today, so I will update the review.
B00EZ85V4I|1|Very cheaply made. And broke when I got in the mail had to glue it back together. Wasn't paying for shipping again.
B0027XEKQ8|5|Works wonderfully as advertised.  Used Camco Vent Installation kit and  vent cover with it.
B00IKVRCBQ|5|Looks and performs excellent. A good bargain.
B00NQKS5NA|5|Great - thanks..
B002XM5G70|4|Nosier than I had expected and surges more than I had expected. Upgraded from a smaller OEM SHURflo model which lasted for 9 years and had as much pressure. Next time would go for am even stronger model.

B0017QV7G2|5|original specs worked as expected
B00KGGTGO4|3|not worth the price I paid, but does do the job.
B000182DVK|5|Great product. The double sided adhesive tape seals to form a water proof joint. No leaks with the windows open. No additional road noise with the windows closed and just what you would expect with the windows open.
B00029XAXS|4|Although I continue to purchase this product, I am kind of stuck with it as after a while he keeps peeling off especially when I get a car wash. I love it when it's new on my car,  but it's definitely not staying on permanently ,and I end up using gorilla glue which is ruin my paint job, but my car is all decorated with stickers and this product so once again I'm stuck with it.
B00Q3NCUL0|5|Literally one of the sickest things I've ever bought on Amazon and I buy cool stuff. Would highly recommend to everybody.

B00LG07MZE|5|Fits my Nissan Pathfinder, easy to fold up after use, excellent value and works well. I would recommend this product.
B003ZATW42|4|Seems tough and leak proof. Hope it holds up to bleach type cleaners. Have not used yet.
B00PWXB2JS|5|third on of these I have gotten and love them! works great and if your truck bed locks it's added security -
B00PRVVZ5G|5|It fits perfectly on the top of my 06 gmc sierras front bumper, it's pretty bright and I can see into the bottom of the ditches and the tops of the trees. It's night and day between my headlights and this Lightbar.  I have gone through the car wash and no water got into the light. I would purchase this again!
B000OCIWR2|4|works great
