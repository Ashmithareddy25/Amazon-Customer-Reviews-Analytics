B001KVZ6HK|2.0|We had read the good reviews of this movie and since we have 3-D TV, we purchased the Four-Disc Combo.  The 3-D effects are well-done, but the movie is constant fighting from the get-go.  Very loud and very boring!
B0031RAOW8|5.0|After all what is there not to like about Richard Gere? This movie is a tear jerker but it is still one of those movies that I will watch again and again. I give this one a BIG thumbs up.
B00628RVV0|5.0|What I liked about this movie: they didn't go for the easy ending.<br />What I questioned about this movie: I'm not sure that the Jewish boy would ever have had the free time to sit in the rubble and have these conversations. But I guess they needed a means of establishing the place for these contacts to occur. What would have been more realistic- and at one point they used- was him in the house cleaning the glasses with his small fingers.<br />Overall, I liked the movie alot.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|this action pack thriller you have to watch from the beginning. but the opening takes you back from the beginning to where  this move begins.<br /><br />bambam
B004WR125O|5.0|I purchased this wireless adapter to go along with my new Onkyo TX-NR809 receiver.  The price was great, easy to set up, and the adapter functions perfectly.  It immediately connected to my home network and I've had zero problems with it after about a month.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Not the movie I had hoped for. . . the out-takes pretty much covered the best parts and the story went downhill from there.  The music and choreography were fun and well done but a real stretch to think these were college kids the plot was so lame.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Temple run 2 seemed like such a good game at first. And it is, for the most part. There are more types of obstacles and you can resurrect after dying simply with a gem. But, I feel that the pace of running is slower  than the original Temple run, which kind of threw me off. The obstacles feel easier too. Between the two, I think I prefer the original.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have a lot of people who are not allowed to be able in my room. Malloy Melvin<br />Is one of those people that are not allowed to be able in my room.
B004PVKFR8|4.0|You know why you are buying this: Sail.  One of the best songs I have ever heard in my life.  If that song comes on, it doesn't matter how loud your stereo is already, you will bump it up louder.  That being said the rest is just okay.  not bad, but nowhere near as real as Sail.  Catchy songs and then one unforgettable one, what's not to like?
B001EN71DG|5.0|I only bought this because it included the original trilogy as originally released. Han shoots first, Darth Vader doesn't completely ruin the drama of silently throwing the emperor with a contrived scream, he still has eyebrows, the ghost of Anakin is still old, and no juvenile musical numbers to wait through with my forehead in my hand.<br /><br />Quit screwing around and release that version in Blu-Ray, with remastered audio and modern widescreen video format.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|We were late and missed the first season on commercial TV, but once we started watching, to catch up, was a MUST!  This series involves so many fairy tales we've all known, and intricately entwines it with a contemporary thread.  Great writing!  Awesome!  I'm so glad we are able to &#34;catch up&#34; with the episodes we missed.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I am not a huge &#34;scary&#34;Stephen King fan, however I loved this book, exciting from the first page...did not end like I expected.....
B007U4DIM6|5.0|Great kids movie with a story.  I loved it and am 75 the dogs are just so cute. I like to buy the animal movies.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|simple and cool. lots of pass time games. points are easy to accumulate.  some are better than others,  but that's. why there's 101 games. kids will enjoy this comp. of simple games.  enjoy.
6303314015|5.0|Everyone in the family loves it! Colorful, interesting animated characters. Good life lessons. Fantastic music! Kids to grandparents will end up singing the songs for years to come.
1933492953|4.0|I was recommended this book by a professor at my University. He swears by this book. I can see why. The artist is very accomplished and skilled in his ways. There is a lot to be learned from the images and techniques shown here, however, I wish there were even more images. Arrived quickly, packaged neatly, and in new condition as promised. Recommend to Illustrators, storytellers, and comic artists alike.
B0070UFMOW|1.0|I bought this to power my Hifiman HE400's.  I used it maybe 10 times, then one day I picked it up and the front faceplate was separating from the body due to some foam or something swelling internally. I tried to contact FiiO and they never responded.  Now it sits in my drawer.<br /><br />The device does have some nice features, but the orientation doesn't allow it to pair well with an ipod.  You have to band them together both facing out which doesn't work very well.  A traditional amp makes much more sense than this.<br /><br />Overall, my opinion is that this thing is WAY overhyped.  I honestly couldn't pick up any obvious improvement in the sound through my ipod/HE400's.
048622709X|3.0|There are a lot of interesting images of hand in this book, and yes, many of them are done well. However there are also a lot of images of hands that are hard to interpret because they are not completely drawn and are in an awkward position. The text around the hands is also useful. Part of the book is not as helpful as other parts. It's an okay source, but if I had to pick between this and another source, I would have gone with another.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book. The characters were unbelievably cruel. The story moved from one depressing scene to another.  I ended up skimming several sections in order to finish the book.  It's one thing to write of the plight of man, but there should be some moments of hope. Not a book I would recommend.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so much fun playing it and I love the new theme Rio is so fun and so was the new York
B003G4W49C|5.0|Their are many reviews here, so there is no point in my rehashing, repeating, and saying the same stuff again. I will just say that of the hundred or so scifi books that I have read in the past 18 months, this was probably my favorite - but certainly in the top 3. Ranks right up there with some of my all-time favorites and as said in the title, &#34;Destined to become a Classic&#34;.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Nice little game very colourful nice graphics can't stop playing it, love the little dragons, can't wait to see what I can breed next.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I quite enjoyed this. The 5 stars may be a bit strong, but i gave them due to the story being well written, the enhanced warriors being believably superior but limited to something less than superman, and the general premise being both believable and likely possible in the not to distant future.<br />I can recommend this without reservation.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I LOVE THIS APP AND I PLAY IT OFTEN...A VERY RELAXING GAME THAT KEEPS ONE ON IT'S TOES BUT AT THE SAME TIME RELAXES ONE TO THE POINT CAN PUT ON TO SLEEP IF YOU GET TOO RELAXED WITH IT....A GAME THAT KEEPS ONE ALERT, HAPPY AND KEEPS YOU COMING BACK TO IT FOR SOMETHING TO DO....VERY RECOMMENDABLE GAME TO PLAY....<br /><br />THIS GAME HAS CHANGED NOW AND WILL NOT WORK PROPERLY THEN WHEN YPU FIRST GOT IT, NOW I HARDLY PLAY IT NOW AND NOW IT WILL NOT CONNECT SO I CAN PLAY IT NOW WHY?????
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book took a long time to get into.  Then I couldn't wait to see how it ended.  But the ending was terrible!!!
B006TJXZ30|4.0|IT'S A GOOD APP SINCE IT DOES GIVE YOU EVERYTHING IT SAYS...HAVE HAD IT FOR A WHILE AND IT GIVE YOU WHAT YOU NEED IN THE SINCE THAT YOU CAN SOCIALIZE, MEET PEOPLE AND OTHER THINGS TOO.
1594487154|5.0|I was lucky enough to see him live presenting many principles of this book.  I admie those who can simplify the comex as he did.  The book gave the depth I needed to fully absorb the principles.  Learn the truth about introverts, extroverts, effective communication skills.....based on facts!
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Recommend this for everyone who can imagine what could happen in the future of the world.<br />Intriguing action realistic imagery frightening
1616550414|4.0|This book has met all my expectations, and then some. It's definitely a must have for any Legend Of Zelda fan, and I think the price is very reasonable. However, the shipping did not meet my expectations as a couple corners are bent and there's a little ding on the top cover. I'm not going to send it back mainly because it's not worth it, but the content itself definitely not disappointing.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|A great hidden objects game the graphics are pretty good. The story plot wasn't bad at all. Found the puzzles fun as well over all a fun hidden objects game.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I have to get up early in the mornings to go to school, it has helped me a lot more than having my mom or dad wake me up in the mornings
B0097HSS4M|5.0|This app is so awesome. It works great for kindle fire. It even lets yu choose photos from yur gallery to work on. Luv it!!! Use it almost everyday.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am enjoying this game, also playing temp run for about 6 months looking forward to playing other temp games
B003WUYRGI|5.0|After I finished reading this helpful books , I will tell all the world about this cool, helpful American Dictionary.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|App is good but wanting an additional nine bucks for a version that is optimized for ICS / JB.  Boo! Shame on them!
B00AVTMB4I|5.0|I'm finding it hard to complain about this movie. There simply isn't anything I can complain about. Great film, worth the buy!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I like the way they tied up the story lines that needed it and started whole new ones that I'm really looking forward to seeing.
B002361MLA|5.0|I got off to a bit of a rocky start with this book, but I quickly got into it after a short time.<br /><br />This is a radical book. It stands much of what I have presumed to be true on its head. I realize that I have assumptions of life so basic that I never have examined them until now.<br /><br />I especially relate to the psychological notions of past (memory; life story) and future (worry and seeking fulfillment in the future). I had a vague idea of these two states, but this book has put them into sharp focus for me. I relate this to Carlos Castaneda and stopping the world and erasing personal history, which i now understand better now than ever before. I'm not sure I buy into the Don Juan idea of recapitalization or of the Eagle devouring our value added awareness at death unless we are clever enough to escape it, but this book has certainly been a life changer for me.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I am now finding that I have drifted off and have been captured in some meaningless monkey chatter of future or past, trying to rewrite the past, reliving something from the past, worrying about the future, running dialogs with someone about something someday. It's all very maddening.<br /><br />Fortunately, I retain a realization of this is what it is like to begin to awaken from such madness. I'm noticing what has been going on all of my life that I had not noticed before.<br /><br />The jig is up, the ego is mounting a final battle, and it looks to be shaping up to be a doosey. Well, it is entertaining, I'll give it that, as my mind does everything it can to avoid the now.<br /><br />My wife and I watched the 60's movie &#34;Charley&#34; (which is based on the story &#34;flowers for Algernon&#34; with some sex and sixties angst thrown in for good measure). I trust this awakening will not be followed by the death of the little mouse and a subsequent reversion to the mean. That would be mean indeed.
0385535147|5.0|Good story. Love the hardcover edition.  Why do i have to leave twenty something words for this review? Thanks John Grisham
B009PJ1Q82|1.0|Precious, self-indulgent film with two very unsympathetic characters, starring two very boring performances. Poor, predictable script with terrible sound and no subtitles to help decipher the incessant mumbling. We hated it. Chalk up another crap film under the gay category.
0399160744|5.0|I had received an email that showed a few scenes from the book, which I had forwarded on to friends.  So when I saw that there was an actual book, I grabbed it.  It made the perfect token gift for college-age young man (who are hard to buy for w/o spending a lot of money), although it would work for any age or gender.
0920668372|5.0|This is a great book. I have given several copies of this book to new mommies. The downside is I made the mistake of going to the authors website and listened to his reading of the story. It sounds like he is reading the funny pages. Maybe that was his intent, for it to be funny, not a sentimental one. I like the sentimental sounding version.
0316227706|5.0|Great fun book to accompany money gift to young man or woman, especially if they are into dogs or photography.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Vin and Elend ... Spook, Ham and Breeze .. And Sazed of course.  All heroes of the ages.  Such a great tale.  It has everything.  The Mistborn trilogy closes with all questions answered, no stones unturned and no loose threads to unravel.  The tapestry is complete.  Great job Brandon!
B00005AXKF|1.0|I purchased this DVD for my God daughter and did not notice it was labeled as a non-English version.  Amazon/seller had no problem accepting the return, but very disappointing when it arrived and could not be played in my Blu-Ray system.

B006FH2W4O|5.0|Patrick O'Brian rights a well crafted and accurate novel on a tall ship's captain and his adventure plundering the French and Spanish. The most beautiful part of this story is all the characters are flawed and none of these flaws are covered up, exposing their hearts to the reader.
B00B780TAK|4.0|This contains a mild spoiler, but no real details.<br /><br />I am surprised that I find myself giving this wonderful series anything less than a 5-star rating.  After viewing the final episode of Season 3, I was inclined to rate this lower, but just couldn't do it.<br /><br />I am trying to be careful not to write a \\"spoiler\\" but after the birth of Sybl's baby (and that is all I will say) I began to have the sense that I was watching a soap opera. Then events surrounding Tom and Jimmy and now, the ending of the final episode, have continued to give that sense.  The series has been cheapened.<br /><br />The wonderful actors and characters, the costumes, beautiful settings both indoors and out, impeccable attention to period details and manners -- so much has made this series a terrific treat - a feast, really, but the art that this series represents is compromised by heavy handedness with the script.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting a fairy tale where nothing tragic ever happens and all live happily ever after, but this series did not present itself to become an emotional roller coaster.  It goes against the grain of all the other features of the viewing experience.  The events have begun to feel contrived.<br /><br />I am relieved that the season is over, wishing that somehow, the ending was all a mistake -- but glad for a break from it.  I am disappointed that I am not eagerly looking forward to Season 4, although of course I will watch it.  Cautiously.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Awesome!! Can't wait for walking disaster! Love the characters, the story it's all captivating! A must read!! The count down for the next book h as started!
B000P0J0A6|5.0|The now classic tale of the Mogwai named Gizmo. A boy receives a unique pet for Christmas with a strange set of rules. Do not expose it to bright light, especially sunlight, never get it wet, and never ever feed it after midnight!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|The thing that always bothered was brightness level  I use a kindle and it takes away a lot of power and when I saw in 10.0 that the brightness level changer came out I was like yes all the yes I'm not using sentences muhaha.
B002QGUFWE|2.0|Alright, so I fell victim to the Gaga craze. I got this album for a couple of song played on the radio. I had hoped to find a few more that I liked as well, but that hope was never realized.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever!!! The only is that I don't know how to update. So, yeah this is only here because of the minimum word limit :P
B0063IH60K|3.0|Not the worst app, but nothing fancy here. Just solitaire. You can pick backgrounds, card front and back designs. You can also choose to have the standard 3 card deal, or 1 card at a time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|better then the last so fun love it should be a ps3 game I would buy it thanks four the app
B003L77GH4|5.0|In the second season of this great show, you discover more and more about Katherine and what her real reason is for being back in Mystic Falls.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|For anyone looking to gain an insight into the mindset of our veterans. This is a good start, with integrity and honest wording, Luttrell plays the narrator to an experience that's true justice wouldn't have been spoken otherwise.
B000TGQDZQ|4.0|If you like female vocals, and a hard metal band, then this is the band for you! I first discovered them by a remake they did of Phantom of the Opera. It did not disappoint!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW!  This book was amazing!  I loved this author's other books, and when I found out about Hopeless I couldn't wait to read it.  Once it was released, I read it in just over a day.  It is such an original story.  The relationship between Sky and Holder is breathtaking.  And when we find out their history, it really moves you to think that such a young boy held out hope for her for so many years, and that these kids had to deal with so much when they were so young.  I LOVED this book and can't wait to see what else this author has in store for us.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I got this app when I saw it constantly advertised on Prize Claw. It's an ok game, good for a time filler.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a fantastic story!  I loved everything about it.  It was set in one of my favorite places in the county, Southport, NC.  Loved the relationships between the characters.  I was totally surprised by the twist at the end.  I would recommend this book to everyone.  Can't wait to see the movie, but I'm sure it couldn't do this book justice as most movies don't.
B0089Q1TPM|4.0|I am not much one for parodies, but this one is a classic! It pokes fun of, without disrespecting, and that is what makes this one of the most funny movies I have ever seen!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Amazingly written and dramatic in all the right places and it made me not want to put it down it was amazing
B0091REZMW|1.0|I love hidden object games. So I was happy when I saw this listed for the Kindle. However, the format doesn't fit well with the screen and is much too small. I have a Fire HD, 8 inch screen, and it was still too small on it.
B00004CZPF|4.0|I really enjoyed tubular II since I have had the CD for years.  Really enjoyed seeing the Scotland concert again.  First saw it on PBS many years ago.  I had to buy a player that plays Region 2 which I also purchased from Amazon and it worked fine.  Tubular III is nice but just not as enjoyable to me as the II.
B000067FP8|4.0|A hilarious sequel to the first movie, you will be sure to enjoy all the humor in it. Gizmo is kidnapped and sent to a lab for experiments. Luckily Billy works in the same building as the lab and he discovers Giz before it's too late. However, as accidents happen, a whole new batch of gremlins get created!
B007ZMAL32|5.0|love this album. dont know who gustav is, but he sounds cool. don't really know what the heck the album is about but i like its vibe. Favorite tracks are Carolus Rex, The Carolean's Player (especially halfway through it), Lion from the North, gott mit uns, and twilight of the thunder god. this is some smokin' stuff.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|This series just gets better and better! Finally Elena starts seeing the softer sides of Damon. Meanwhile Stefan stops being 'the good brother' due to being under Klaus's control. Very good season full of surprises, twists and turns as you have come to expect of Vampire Diaries.
B007SGM084|5.0|Don't start it unless you can finish it. Very hard to put down. Encouraging my husband to read it. Awesome story line. Awesome book. Loved every bit of it.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|If you are Star Wars lovers anyway. I got this set for my daughter and her father as they always bonded over watching the show on tv. I enjoyed sitting down and watching it with them.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|I am very pleased with my purchase of Halcyon. I will admit I only knew Ellie Goulding from her hit LIGHTS but decided to give her new cd a whirl. Its pop music but not pop like Britney Spears. This is like pop music with substance. I love it and have quickly become a big Ellie Goulding fan.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Usually I can't books in this series down but this one was just ehhhh....still wanted to know what happened but took me longer to finish.
B0050XFY4O|4.0|This was a beautifully filmed story, and very sensual. The entire cast was terrific. From their childhood to adulthood, the brothers' character development was excellent, and I really cared about their relationship. The story itself was unusual, but it was handled with outstanding sensitivity. And I must say I was a bit surprised, yet pleased with the ending.
0770435726|2.0|While the plot of this book is a very interesting idea it goes at a snaaaiiiiilllls pace. If it was 1/5 shorter with a lot of the padding and repetition taken out it would have been much better.
0385535147|5.0|This was another great novel written by Grisham.  I loved the start, and I loved the twists and turns.  I wasn't sure where this was going when it all started in a Federal Prison, but it was worth the time to read.  While a bit far fetched, it is for pure entertainment, and entertain it did.  I would recommend this book to any Grisham lover, and anyone who loves it when someone is smarter than the average fox. Enjoyed it!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really like temple run 2. It is so much more fun than temple run. However it has a lot of glitches and runs kinds slow.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this app and its definitely a much wanted pet app... my only complaint is problems with opening on my kindle fire, but amazing graphics when it does.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Basically the mobile version of Weather.com, this app is filled with tons of helpful features, including forecasts, radar, weather news and much more. Definitely recommend it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really enjoy the acting, storylines, characters, and many aspect of this series.  Nine episodes does not seem like enough - and especially with all of the stuff going on, I wish I could get more without waiting 11 months in between gratification.  The writers are not afraid to take bold moves and although I don't always agree - it does keep me coming back for more.
B006WQLH7G|3.0|I downloaded this app on my Velocity Cruz tablet, and it didn't work. If your tablet is incompatible with certain apps (angry birds, netflix, etc.), don't bother. However, I use Avast! on my own PC's, and I love their virus protection. I would recommend avast to anyone!
1439127700|5.0|This was a gift for my husband. He loves this book and can not put it down. Would love to read other books by this author.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I adore pinterest, and this app is the mobile extension of the website. Works very well. Absolutely recommend for anyone who uses pinterest.com!
B0053O89KG|2.0|Even though this disks are brand new, they play each episode and then freeze and then skip to the credits.  It is extremely frustrating and annoying.  I don't like that I spent all that kind of money and have to turn around and buy it all over again.  This is the second product that I have purchased through Amazon and the second one that I have had some sort of problem with.  Amazon went well out of their way for the last thing that I bought, to make sure that I was satisfied.  That is the reason that I keep returning to buy things.  Maybe I'll find another copy of this that is worth buying.
B004GYY714|2.0|I downloaded this app on my Velocity Cruz tablet, and it didn't work. If your tablet is incompatible with certain apps (angry birds, netflix, etc.), don't bother.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This virtual game is really good I enjoy because of the graphics and because of theatricality.what I think would make it better sis if you could choose what horse you Wanted at the start.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|I downloaded this app on my Velocity Cruz tablet, and it didn't work. If your tablet is incompatible with certain apps (angry birds, netflix, etc.), don't bother.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I first heard this album after my then-girlfriend (now-wife) sent me the songs and I wasn't all that excited at first.  In fact, I raised my eyebrows and didn't know how to feel about it.  The sound is different, but I grew to love many of the songs, including \\"Hidden Away,\\" \\"Walk Away,\\" \\"Straight To You,\\" and \\"Higher Window.\\"  I always love the foreign songs that Josh makes the effort to put on every album, including the variety of languages on this particular album (Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian).  It may not be my favorite Josh Groban album of all time, but I have grown to love it and see the change that Josh is attempting to make in his music.  I am looking forward to \\"All That Echoes,\\" which releases in one week's time!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great app very fun and u don't have to spend a ton of money to play!!!!  highly recamond ( and u get 3 gems for leaving a reveiw!)
1457514508|5.0|\\"Day after day, you go to work.  You might take the train or maybe the bus.  You shop at the same stores.  You walk down the same sidewalks.  You see you the same people, day after day.  Strangers once, they become nodding acquaintances, then familiar faces.  Daily contact strengthens relationships.  Some become friends, others you scorn.  You believe you really know each other.  But what has changed, really, beyond happenstance contact?  Do you really know your coworker?  Your neighbor?  Your friend?  Can you vouch for their honesty?  Their morals?  Do you know all their secrets?  Or do you just think you do?  The sweet old lady next door couldn't possibly be a killer.  Or could she?  Your best friend wouldn't be jealous of your good looks?  Or is she?  That good-looking young father and house-husband is just the perfect role model.  Isn't he?  In the town of Gordonston, a sorrowful event has occurred.  Thelma Miller, wife, mother, friend to all, has died.  And the neighborhood tilts a little on its axis, a bit out of control.  A common mistake made by many is taking a few facts, a few assumptions, and creating a persona that may not be a good fit.  In fact, you could be wrong - dead wrong.  Author Duncan Whitehead does a masterful job in creating a delightful community, and then wreaks havoc on it.  This suspenseful thriller is sure to delight you as it twists its way to a powerful conclusion you won't easily believe but have to accept.  And it will cause you to think twice as you exchange pleasantries with the people you think you know.\\"  I received this book free from The Cadence Group.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|at first it was fun but after I got out of the app once it wouldn't let me in it again! plus once I couldn't get into my kindle for a week!!! get this game if you want to love it and then find out you cant play it again!!!! :(
B004HD61KE|4.0|It had a novel base full of  action and history. It was well written and kept me involved to the end.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Really good book, you don't see this ending coming at you like a runaway jet.  I have always loved John Grisham, this isn't one of his great books, but it's a really good read.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Game is fun to play, but isn't much of a hidden object game as it is categorized. It is more of a mystery solving game. Recommend it for a good days play though.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett is always fabulous!  Well researched, imaginatively constructed and wonderfully real characters.  This is another very long book, but worth every page.  I'm excited to read the follow up books.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book will take you on an emotional roller coaster ride like you've never experienced before. It's an absolute must read!

B004HD61KE|4.0|This is not great literature but is fun. It blends beliefs of the Mormon Religion with true fiction in an interesting way.
B00004UEDQ|5.0|Excellent movie for those who may be struggling with a drinking problem...big or small must see movie to better understand both sides.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I purchased this bag for the use of my Nikon D5100 and a few of my lens. So far the bag has been great to me. As a beginning student photographer, for this price,  I would recommend.
B000CNFC76|5.0|Love golf? Then you will enjoy watching Shia LaBeouf in this representation of the rise of a world reknown amateur golfer. It was very informational and fun to watch!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this game is actually good. I have time at work to take a break and play this. sometimes I get back late Cu's I cant stop playing
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Beautiful in HD . Very good acting. Story is intriguing making you want the next episode to see what the characters are going to do next.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|By far, one of the best movies.  Excellent plot and the movie kept you on the edge of your seat.  Liam Neeson makes the BEST bad good guy.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Outstanding<br /><br />Enjoyed from beginning to end.  Read after watching the movie and was happy to find the extensive detail that would have been impossible to include in a motion picture format.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Rodriguez's poetry, written decades ago, continues to be relevant.  The quality of his vocals leave you wanting more.  There are rumors that he may make a new album!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book. Interesting turn of events. Can't wait to read the last and final book to see how it all ends.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It would be better if it could turn on my device if i had a alarm on though. It's still a pretty good app either way. Wish it had more colors and the weather was more accurate.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's very addicting I play every day. It's so much fun it's practically the same as temple run but that's ok
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played and if you like it you should also try temple run and streaker run REALY Fun
B005LAIIJY|4.0|Quentin Tarantino has somehow made this over-the-top piece of film come to life and smack you across the lips with audacity.  You'll either like it for its unique artistry or hate it for breaking all rules and not following any hollywood pattern. At a time when gun control laws are being revisited in the united states, Tarantino dares to put a armed, sharp-shooting, former black slave turned bounty hunter into a vengeful role of serving up justice in the south.  If the bloody violence and gritty characters don't get you, the stimulating soundtrack will. DJANGO!<br /><br />I'm almost embarassed to say that I liked it. But I did. Only Tarantino.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I bouth two watches seikon mens SNK809 to give them as presents. one for my brother and the other for my stepson. one of them it didnt work well it sound if something was working from inside the problem was that the holidays came and i couldnt send back until JAN 15 i request to send back and the pay everything from ups and in three days i already had it back awesome watch and awesome service. keep up the good work guys
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is my favorite show on TV right now.  While season three is not over yet (Watched the Fall portion - Coming back on in Feb.) this is the best season so far. Because this is based on a comic book series and follows that story fairly close, they don't mind keeping the story dark and killing off the main characters. Makes for very interesting and unexpected TV. Even if you don't like zombies and blood & gore (like my wife) the story is very gripping and will keep you coming back.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who loves a mystery, great characters and laughs along the way.  The bonus features are awesome.
0470913029|5.0|Great way to eat, been generally following it for 3 years, have lost weight, and improved my blood chemistry and pressure. Initially lost 20 lbs. now have started weightlifting again, thus have put 6 lbs of muscle back on. I am lean and cut, on not meds and I'm 50 years old. Processed carbs = suger, don't eat them. Very, very, VERY simple &#34;diet&#34; to follow. Eat lean meat and fish, freash fruit and vigies. Don't eat much of anything else. What u eat maters as much as the quantity. U can eat well, and not be hungry, IF u eat the right foods.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I got the movie and everything worked, it came on time and i have no complaints at all with the whole process
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Had to see it twice, but then it all came together.  A good wrap up that leaves some openings for a new generation.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the entire series. Not a perfect ending, but a realistic ending. No fantasy utopia, but the very beginnings after the war.
B009PJ1Q82|5.0|This is a film that will stay with you long after the final credits have rolled. A riveting portrayal of a 10 year relationship between two men, the film explores the interplay between addiction, love, and dependence. The acting is superb- Thure Lindhardt deserves multiple awards for this role.
B008ASGP3U|1.0|Just plain boring! Characters uninteresting, story moves at a snails pace, and in the end you figured you just wasted a part of your life reading it.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Play subway suffers share it to all your friends it rocks and it more it is my favotvie game so play more
B00A80SHFM|4.0|If you liked the movie or the play this music will bring you back to the events as they unfold.  I think it was well done and bought two CD's, one for us and another as a gift.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Loved it! Had to watch one episode after the other. Really keeps you on your toes. Highly recommended for anyone into suspense/ horror films.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I used to play this game occasionally and it had some small ad banners that weren't bothersome.  Now, they have full page ads that keep popping up and are extremely annoying.  I'm uninstalling this app.  Not worth the annoyance!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|What a great read! I read this book in 4 days. There was alot to process and alot of stories going on at the same time, but written very well. I think it is the best of the three books. Each had their own story and yet all tied together in the end.
B0076DELIG|3.0|A page turner as usual.  Bosch is a familiar and predictable character.  the only aspect which is too predictable is that 20 pages before the end he is always in a life or death situation.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|Amazing story with a very well picked staff. A great movie to watch anytime and highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a heartwarming story.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|A heart wrenching story of a Brit who doesn't come to grips with much of his life until it is almost too late.  The reader takes the pilgrimage with Harold Fry.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Only finished reading this because we had picked it for bookclub.  Was a chore to finish.  Truly disliked the characters.  Would not read anything else by this author.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|Really like the case.  First one I have ever had but I and very happy with it.  Liked that there was a good selection of colors.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It isn't until halfway through this book that you find out what the title really refers to.  Even then, many questions are not answered until the end.  I don't want to give anything away because the best part of the book was the plot.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome fun for kids wanting to get used to having a horse. realistic looking all the way. loved adding this game
0312330855|5.0|Read this and you will fall in love with the English countryside and the life of a country vet.<br />From calfing to lambing to the author's imaginings and his own courting story, in witty style and easy prose, this book is so easy to read and fall in love with.
B009ZFPQOQ|4.0|Waze is great at telling you information about what is around you and around your proposed route, especially if you have another person along to operate it while you drive. It is less good at leading you to your desired destination.  Dedicated GPS units are increasingly more accurate affordable, if you don't buy all the bells and whistles. Using a dedicated GPS along with Waze is the best of both worlds.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I thought it was amazing! And the music is great! Laugh out loud funny, with just enough love story to make you say \\"awww\\"!
B005EVVESM|5.0|iove how fast i recieved mt package and i didnt have to wait by the door becuase it came when it was supposed to come l
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This assembling of the Avengers is the best thing to happen to the superhero movie business. With a perfect director, visual effects and actors in their respective roles, The Avengers is a hands down 5 out 5. It packs plenty of action with a perfect mix of humor with a catchy dialogue. And also this Blu-Ray is disc is FLAWLESS! Full 1080p with full screen ratio. ONE OF THE BEST BLU-RAYS out on the market now.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The game is so good, once I start playing I can't stop. So addictive love it..<br />Everyone should give it a try...
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Thor was a nice change of pace for the superhero movies, introducing a new character. The movie was a great start to the story of Thor, a visual masterpiece on Blu-Ray and Hemsworth delivers a perfect role.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I got this game and its fun but the prices are outrageous. Like the characters are like a lot of coins. And if you wanna buy coins with a credit card its like $19.00. Plus the hoverboards. But the game is fun to play any way but lower the prices.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It's ok but I wish they came out with an update so It can be more like the computer version.
B00AB0AXU6|5.0|I like the movie so much and i like th quality of the movie even more.  Even though the HD quality is not Blue Ray it is OK.
B005HP2J66|5.0|Great photography and a wonderful reminder of our past.  It's difficult to wrap ones mind around people living 35 thousand years ago and drawing such beautiful pictures.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game. I reccemend it! I thought that it was pretty impressive and i am very picky. I agree with all of those who like this game
B008K93302|1.0|Like others have said, it is not even worth the .99 cents I paid. Free would not be worth it!<br />A waste of time and money.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|I was anxiously awaiting the release of this movie and I was not disappointed!  Do not miss this series if you are a true Batman fan.
B003TGMFG4|5.0|Krakauer at his finest; has managed to sort through a myriad of details, includes only the most relevant, poignant - those that advance the tragic story - and a whale of a story it is.  Alex Supertramp can be seen as a reckless kid with no concern for the grief he is causing his mostly wonderful family - OR - he can be seen as an idealistic youth with the courage and determination to follow his dreams. Krakauer's genius is that he leaves the question open to interpretation by every reader. There are at least two other elements that cry out to be mentioned: Krakauer, attempting to give context to the protagonist, spends 11 pages on another eccentric, astonishing kid - Everett Ruess - who meets a similar end. This is NOT a distraction, but helps deepen our understanding of the relentless impulses that must be obeyed. In addition, Krakauer tells of his own heroic and near fatal efforts at climbing the Devil's Thumb - a crazy stunt possible only if you've got more guts and vision than 99% of the rest of us. He does. This reviewer has read the book 3 times - and not for the last time!
B004CIIXFA|4.0|I am still not sure how I felt about this movie. They are all so damaged, and human, but some of it just threw me I guess. The lead is great, although she does seem to literally wander around for a large majority of the movie. I hope to see her in more roles, though I dont see anything else for her on IMDB. Fassbender was good, as always, always sticks to those somewhat risky roles like this one. I think maybe this once scene towards the end is what really confused me and just seemed a little out of character and just odd in a way. And although I read other people saying that it has its own happy ending, it isnt really. Not sure if they forgot she is 15 or what but the ending is just as somewhat bleak as the rest. I know Im not selling it, but it was an interesting watch, made me squirm in discomfort a bit which I guess shows how invested I got.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I have like T+S for a little while but I have to say this to me is some of their best work. This is very POP for these two which was a surprise but it really worked in thier favor rather well. I will say there is not one weak track on this album I have listened though several times and I can already tell this will be a classic for me. I am so so so happy with this album AHHHHH!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mojang has really done it!<br />They have been able to update Minecraft,Minecraft Xbox 360 edition, and deliver and update Minecaft Pocket edition.This and the fact that they made a movie shows how awesome they are.Even though there are buggs it just seems more like controls, which if your a huge spelunker like me are amazing.It is so smooth and easy to run and the charecter automaticly jumps for you. If your angry about this game not being perfect you've got some very high standards . Because a tablet game is like seeing the movie after reading a book.This game is great for you hard core fans but not a good square one for people who are new to the game.<br /><br />Thank you for your time and keep on crafting!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This movie is perfect. The disc is so cool considering that while watching the movie you can bookmark favorite scenes. I love the fact that I can add the digital copy to my iPod as well. I can watch the DVD in my laptop which works great for me. Totally worth it!
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|Didnt work says I need drivers. Cant get kindle to connect so I can download my books etc. bought the cable. It doesnt work either
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend for christmas and his birthday. he likes it. there weren't anything wrong with but I'm not sure on the special features as he doesn't watch them. Totally worth it you like thor or avengers
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Fantastic! Great dystopia novella, better than most you see out. Well written and unique. A fresh breath in a rapidly suffocating genre.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|It's safe to say that I love the vampire diaries. This is the best show ever. I love the special features and interviews with the cast and crew. I watched the first season on TV but I was so happy to get this on DVD. If your a fan of vampire diaries this is a must have. This isn't anything like Twilight so if you hate that but love vampires this will be perfect for you.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I don't normally read this genre, but this book is so crazy, and well written, I have to now read her other books!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not for little kids. But still riveting emotions of the characters and the idea of the book is interesting if you can handle it buy it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I told my friend that I didn't like Temple Run. She said,&quot;Don't get download Temple Run 2. I got it anyway. Glad I did.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|Tegan And Sara, ever since So Jealous, have put out some of the catchiest, heartfelt music that spans multiple genres. The Con was probably their most diverse, consistent, and overall best album, meshing Tegan's heartbreaking and beautiful lyrics and Sara's off the wall catchiness perfectly. That is, until Heartthrob.<br /><br />Heartthrob is the album that will permanently put T&S in the spotlight. Tegan And Sara are at the top of their game here, putting out some of the best tunes the indie scene has seen in a long time. Closer, the first single, is one of the best ways to get a feel for how this album as a whole will probably sound. The dreamy sound, excellent lyrics, duelling vocals, this is the perfect judge for which to base Heartthrob.<br /><br />With only ten songs, the girls put that time to good use. Moving past the excellent Closer, Goodbye, Goodbye offers up more well done break up fodder, yet also has a fantastic 80s vibe going for it (as does most of this CD). I'm Not Your Hero is an anthemic chorus-driven track, How Come You Don't Want Me (my personal favorite) has so much going for it, catchy chorus, aching vocals, and a very Ting Tings feel throughout. I Couldn't Be Your Friend has a sentiment most of us can say we've felt it that drives the song, Love They Say is another lyrical behemoth that will have you relating to it. Now I'm All Messed Up is the last song I'll mention (though Shock To Your System is a great finale), simply because of the funky synthesizer beat and echoy vocals moving nicely into the great chorus. This is a song that really feels new to Tegan and Sara's arsenal. I can't think of any songs that are comparable. Definitely worth checking out.<br /><br />Overall, Heartthrob was worth the wait. Sure this will be the album that finds them a much wider audience with superstars like Katy Perry and Sara Bareilles (in her own right) pushing it in their Twitter feeds, but more importantly this is a CD that longtime fans can grasp. It is a new sound that shows a lot of maturity, but that Tegan and Sara 'vibe' is still there. Highly recommended.new sound that shows a lot of maturity, but that Tegan and Sara 'vibe' is still there. Highly recommended.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|The quality of the picture and sound is at least equal to the quality of the production of this great series!  We'll be getting Season 3 very very soon!
B007MDB548|5.0|I find myself actually enjoying the tinkerbell movies when I watch them with my daughter.  I sometimes want to watch them even without her!
B008XG1X18|3.0|The pinterest website displays really well on the kindle.  It only gets a little awkward when you're trying to comment on a pin or edit a specific pin.  I don't feel like the mobile app really resolved etiher of these options that well and the &#34;mobile&#34; format of viewing one image at a time is great for the phone but looks very unreadable on the kindle.  I think the fun of a tablet is that you can use a website like this and see more than one image.  I think the app should work to the strengths of the tablet and its not really there yet.
B003IKMR0U|2.0|I'm confused by the other glowing reviews for this game as my kids and I have found it mediocre at best. Granted, we are avid game players but we have found this very uninteresting. It's a bit like Farkle but without the math skills, complexity (although Farkle is easy to understand) and variability. I would agree it's easy to bring to restaurants, on trips, etc. but there are several other games that are easily portable that we enjoy much more (Chips, Blink, Banagrams).
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run two is sooooooooooooooooooooooo awesome and so cool and I love it sooooooooooooooooooooooo much it is the best game ever.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|littlest. pet shop is very fun for all ages.  yet the one thing that I would recemened is a way to earn free daimonds or whatever u want to call them.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Always enjoy the Harry Bosch books..this is one my favorites!  Hated for it to end! I have read them all!!!!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|While I am not a big Nelson DeMille fan it was fun to read this character again...this is typical John Corey in a fairly fast moving plot.  Aside from the character I enjoyed rfeading about an Arab state that I knew little about.  If you like John Corey you will like this book.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I really wish there was a smart woman depicted in this book.  She may be a virgin but why is she so clueless and acting like she is 14?  The biting lip thing, the lack of of direct communication, the inability to see it coming as far as disappointments,...etc.  I like erotic reads but sometimes it really needs to not show such an airhead as the main character.  A billionaire is not even realistic for a \\"first love.\\"  Write Smarter for Pete's sake!!
0439023513|1.0|I havent received the book yet. it has been more than a month since I made the order for the book.<br />what is going on?
B00ARI9CDQ|4.0|Informative. I enjoy catching up on pop culture. This app keeps me informed anytime I want to catch up on Hollywood.
B003OFHMKO|5.0|This is a magical CD! Ms Spalding is like no other! I love her work and look forward to hearing other CDs!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a really fun game I wish it was available for the Wii and the Ds it is that fun I love it.
1400067820|5.0|Yet another great work by one of the greatest contemporary philosophers. Reading Taleb is always such a gratifying intellectual experience and Antifragile falls nothing short of that.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|This is one  of the best books I have ever read!! I can identify with some of the characters really well and it tops even the inheritance cycle
B0078XFYDA|3.0|I have read several other Richard Dawkins books and would have given them all 5 stars. In reading this one I certainly learned new information but often wanted more detail or depth. This would be a good introductory book for Junior High or early High School kids but is less suitable for more mature readers who are generally aware of the topics covered.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is an all right little time waster.  It is far too difficult to accumulate gems, though, so getting the pretty shiny horses with the hideous growths on their heads is nigh on impossible.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I really like the modern funny parts , but even better than that, I finally started &#34;getting&#34; Jane Austen.  After watching this, I went back and watched Keira Knightley's version again, and enjoyed it more than the first time.  Then I got the Colin tv version from 1995 and loved that, too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers! the game is awesome and it is a very good twist to temple run. The people who made this game are geniuses! I love subway surfers!!!
B00005N5RM|5.0|I'm almost ashamed to admit I like this version better than the original.  This Blob is a bit more aggressive and as such, the suspense jumps a notch or two above the first.  You actually get to see the results of being overtaken by the Blob.  Fear of the unknown is one thing, but seeing the results of what something can do leaves no doubt.  In the first film, the Blob looked like a dab of strawberry jam on the loose.  This Blob isn't afraid to show how it absorbs people.  It's also easier to believe the \\"kids\\" starring in this version are kids (or thereabouts) as opposed to the middle-aged teens in the first offering.  I also love that this film opens with the suggestion that the city is already a ghost town, devoid of people.  There's just more to consider in this version than the first.<br /><br />I always watch these two films as a double feature, never one, or the other.<br />It's like the Blob came back with his older brother and he's going to beat the crap out of you.
B001GA1RFA|4.0|This was an amazing,amazing book and I love John greens personality when he writes and the way you can get lost in the book.
B00A7CF1QY|5.0|This franchise is my favorite I wil go see every one in the theater and buy it when it comes out on DVD
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Comes in handy when using my Kindle and especially if u don't have paper and pen handy!  Especially like that you can view the note messages in a list.  Give it a shot.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Wasn't sure about this movie and I ended up liking it. I'm glad I have a big screen TV because it must be watched with the full movie effect
B009VB97EY|4.0|I liked this movie because it actually had a plot. A lot of buns and a weak leading actress but overall a good movie. Be careful though, it gets a little too up close and personal in some scenes.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow. This book is incredible. Full of twists and turns. You'll never see it coming.<br /><br />You really form a relationship with these characters and root for your favorites.<br /><br />Must read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an amazing app to have on your kindle fire HD but when will their be a update for the kindle fire HD edition because I know this is a update for the iPhone 4s because I have one myself just come out with an update PLEASE !!!!!!!
B00000F14B|5.0|I remember watching this as a child and I loved it then as I love it now.  My children, who are Andy Griffith fans, thought it was great they recognized &#34;Opie.&#34;
1439170916|5.0|A biography of cancer for both the expert and the layman -- this is an amazing book.  It is interesting and well-written, and I would recommend it to everyone.
0060935464|5.0|Highly recommend it. Fantastic story and characters. A real awe experience to me. Loved Scout and Atticus and the positive effect of a parent on children believes
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This app will not let me get inside of it! Whenever I try to go on it, it goes black and goes back to the home screen of my kindle fire. At first it was fun then it started crashing!
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Very good for charging.  It is much much better than having it plugged into my computer which was very slow.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Have always been a sucker for World War II movies especially with the Air Corps/Navy as its core.  Throw in romance, intrigue and terrific actors and it is a hit.
B001LQQJ3E|5.0|I got this for my next door neighbor.  He loves everything retro.  Every time I see him he stops to thank me for this DVD.  I guess it was 5 stars for him, and for all he does for me (including dog sitting while I'm away), it was worth the price.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am fortunate the universe needed to be acknowledged this week and nudged this book into my existence.  Bittersweet morsels of literary genius are dancing around my brain and have adhered themselves to my heart.  Life is temporary but the richness of this book is infinite and I am a glutton for the punishment.  You should take this journey... be prepared for the scars.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Been looking for a self winding watch for years.  This is an accurate watch that can be worn casually and as a dress watch.  Price was within my budget
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really cute game my daughter and I love it thanks for the time<br />We have a really good time with it
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Umm... wow! It takes a lot to get me to leave a review. I'm both super impressed and super pleased with this app. It's exactly what I was looking for in a list/note taking app. TONS of options, great customization. Love the ability to colour code. Also nice big text with the check lists, so it's easy to mark off., much better than evernote and its checklist option.No annoying ads so far. I'd even pay for this app.
B0058YZBPM|4.0|I love the Trail gloves so I got these for running in the rain.  It's different then the trail gloves as there are not as wide as the trail but I hope they stretch out after wearing it for a bit.  Also not as breathable but since its for wet weather, they work.  Definite worth getting.
0812979702|5.0|Had this book long ago--enjoyed it then. Bought it for a friend getting into golf since retirement and re-read it before giving it up. Yes! It's still a good one for the golf library!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I was not completely captivated by the story, but it held my interest in a few sections. It became predictable near the end and was just too neat of an ending.
1451695195|5.0|I loved the book, and then had a sudden impulse to buy a copy for everyone who had an impact on my life.  I bought more than 40 copies through amazon and mailed them as a late &#34;happy new year gift&#34;.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This game would be absolutely amazing. 5 stars. I got 8.4 million points and 11k coins/31k meters in my best run. But for some reason now it won't open. Starts to load and then sends me right back to the home page of my Kindle Fire. Please fix this Imangi. You wouldn't want this amazing game to go to waste because of some bugs. 1 star until fixed. Please let me rate this 5 stars.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awesome and it's my favorite game but you can't get any of the updates on kindle. : (

B008RA3X5E|5.0|THIS ALARM APP IS SO EASY TO USE. THE ALARM CAN BE SET AS A ONE TIME EVENT OR AS A REPEATING EVENT. IT ALSO HAS A VARIETY OF MUSIC TO WAKE UP TO. I LOVE USING IT AS AN EXTRA ALARM - ESPECIALLY ON TRIPS.
1609611543|5.0|This is a great book, It really makes sense about how wheat has been modified since the 1950's. Get the book! I am now down 11 lbs.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I liked it as much as the next guy. It's cool with ziplines and stuff. But it gets old after a while still a good app
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|A great continuation of the Jack Ryan saga. Current and relevent to real world situations concerning the web and cyber security, and dependence
B000HF0KXU|5.0|It starts out a little hard to understand, but it gets good. Lots of shoot em up and great story line.
B008AWBQGW|5.0|I love southern rock but was stuck in the past. I liistened to samples of this album and could not believe that I have been missing out on this all those years. I also bought god and guns. This album is the best though. It is really, really good. I was still stuck in the old lynyrd skynyrd and blackfoot...
B003R50FRI|5.0|I have a degree majoring in Literature and this has to be one of the very best books I have read in my 74 years.A story which captures you right from the start with a complete mixture of intrigue, romance and suspense. But most of all it is memorable for the standard of its writing and the insight it provides to the human mind and in particular to the Indian psyche and history.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is super fun! I love horses and this is treat to play when you don't have enough money for a real horse.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Wow another great book, can't wait til May for the next one. I so love these characters,  and the storyline is easy to follow
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very intense, and the kind of book that makes you want to keep reading.  Sad but is written so well, that you feel like you're actually there.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Cool game but where is the update? I Got it on my iPod  and there was a cool update with armor, signs, baby animals, fancy clouds, improved d-pad, new blocks, and sand and gravel have gravity. BUT IT IS NOT ON MY MY KINDLE!!<br />C'mon Amazon!!
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|One of the years best movies. This is a great movie. Very funny!! Thus one will really  keep  you laughing.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is a awesome game. It is so fun and entertaining.I love playing it.I rate that I love this game and you should too.
B0093URN4E|5.0|I am new to Converge but am now a huge fan.  &#34;All We Love We Leave Behind&#34; b is an awesome record for anyone who appreciates hard music.
B0058YZ4J0|4.0|It is a great shoe I just wish they made half sizes  I wear a 12.5. 12.0 is too small and 13 is too big
B00AREIAI8|4.0|really fun but it wont open again after I close it. so I uninstalled andreinstalled. it still is doing the same thing.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The Alien Anthology on Blu-ray for the daily special for $26.00.  All these are extended release versions and the quality is amazing esp. Alien and Aliens considering how old these films are.
B008MWBY6W|3.0|The over the shoulder carrying strap for my case broke about 5 minutes after i took it out of the box. There a small plastic clip on the strap that slides into another plastic piece attached to the holster that just broke off. I was not swinging it around or doing anything close to that. My guess would be i got a bad seed, which i'm sure amazon would gladly replace. However, i believe this does give some insight into the product itself, if put under harsh conditions. i have included a picture of the piece that broke under customer images. i am still able to use the strap, though it will occasionally give out and come undone. =/<br /><br />THAT being said, i really do like having a camera holster that fits the camera, and not some huge backpack or carrying case that makes me look like a tourist. It isn't nearly as bulky, has moveable pieces inside that you can move around to make your camera fit nice a snug. it has a few zippers on the outside, but does not have room for extra lenses anywhere.<br /><br />I am a first time DSLR owner, i have a canon t3, and i own one lens.
B0012QTT4O|5.0|I dont know how else to say this but BB is one of the greatest tv show of all time.The writing is brilliant.The actors give one of the greatest performances put to film.For me breaking bad has changed the way I look at tv shows.Like everything I thing i watch now is trash compared to  breaking bad.i havent gotten around to  watching the sopranos and the wire but it doesnt matter.In my opinion breaking bad will always be my favorite and greatest tv show.
B004H1V5RU|2.0|We purchased this back in October to give to my son for Christmas.  It broke within two hours of using it.  When I contacted the return department at Amazon, I was informed that I could not return it with them because it was beyond the 30 day return policy.  However, I did reach out to the Perplexus company and they sent me a replacement for free.<br />So far, we have no new issues.  Hopefully it stays this way.  I can say that due to the ridiculous return policy Amazon has, I will no longer purchase Christmas presents from them.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|My children really enjoyed this funny movie about growing up. They loved the concept of the monsters hiding from humans.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love the story. It's got some hot stuff in it but not because of that. The characters are fantastic, you can't help but get wrapped up in them. I was sad when I had finished it.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Baldacci has created a great leading character in John Puller. It was an exciting read all the way to the end.
B009NCM248|5.0|Great songs top to bottom!  First album or SS's I have ever bought but now I know I must have more!
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|I still prefer the songs as presented in the film, but the recordings are still bouncy, high-energy, and loads of fun.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Amazing read even after the movie.  . .<br />. . . . . . . . .<br /> . . .
B00992CF6W|5.0|when is the new update for the kindle fire with the baby animals? I love this app but since I have a kindle I get the updates later than my sister who has a ipod
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Downloaded it just to see what it was like.  Would say check it out for young girls.  For a free game it's great!
6305428042|5.0|it is a good movie<br />they s h i p p e d i t q u i c k
B001EC2IXK|5.0|Seriously, Who has not seen this? All men at some time in their life want to be Cool Hand Luke. A true &#34;American&#34; movie, can't remember the last time Hollywood made a real movie..perhaps &#34;October Sky&#34; where the underdog stands up and becomes something great, or in the case of Cool Hand Luke-a hero to other men. Two movies that should be part of any collection of GREAT movies. 1. Cool Hand Luke 2. October Sky.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|What can't you like about this movie? You got bruce willis playing a retired cia agent who kicks a**. RED
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. But the nether reactor should have iron blocks instead of gold and when I finally got all my gold it just disappeared and made a big obsidian tower. The update is awesome. The game should have caves lava. Thanks for the awesome game Mojang.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great series, everything looked and sounded real, you lose yourself watching it,<br />I wish there is more like it.<br />Nice and clean fun.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|I seen this movie when I was out of town and didn't get a chance to see the end, so I was very excited about locating it, very very good movie and I really enjoyed it, Thank you so much.
B004SIP6BI|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites and I am so happy I found it at such a great price!
B004EPYZT4|5.0|Very good movie,a lot of action, the sound, color  is in great condition, the movie arrived on time, Thank you so much for this entertainment.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome book.....Happy Endings always......ready for another one...Lots of action and was the one I loke best out of all three...
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This heart-felt story grabbed me from the very first page and never let me down. A great and intense read!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the book. Hope the movie is kept with the book. It needs to be kept as inocient as the book. That is what helped make it to good.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|best book i ever read you wont regret it! i was totally obsessed read the whole series please! awesomly awesome! it is so sweet and good!
B00846REIS|4.0|Up to par with Fifty Shades. Enjoyed the first book and plan to read the second one. Here we go..
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Nice game good grsphics that is a silly rule why 30 words why not 5, 10 100. Do you want review or not
B0063IH60K|5.0|Used to play it on my computer but the Kindle is more relaxing. I can sit on my couch and play
B002VWNIAY|5.0|Casablanca is by far one of the single best movies ever made and winner of best picture back in 1943.  On top of that you had some many one liner's from the actor Bogart \\"Here's looking at you, kid\\" \\"All the gin joints, in all the world...\\" \\"Looks like the beggining of a beautiful friendship.\\"  Plus mutiple other lines that can be quoted.  I just own the regular version not any of the special editions of this movie,  but I have watched it many times over these past few years and still never get tired of watching it, plus has one of the most pretty actress during that era in the actress named Ingrid Bergman.  But if your looking for a classic drama movie with many famous lines within the movie and people's choice as one of best movies ever made in movie history then pick this movie up and add it to your collection because it is worth every cent.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Used to play this when I had Atari years ago.  Lots of fun brings back good memories of trying to win
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think that this game is fun to play but also make u work harder amend as faster... I love temple run 2!!!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It's all time addicting. It's like the game brings you in with its cool gadgets and suits and its pretty funny when he gets shocked. I totally recommend it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Lol!! i love it and it is better than dragon story..i like most of the storm8 games..but half the time they wont come on an they stall alot...Backflip Studios Inc...hoooray!!!!
141694737X|5.0|I found this book to cute and very tasteful for small children.  Very nice illustrations.  I highly recommend this book for small children.
1481251880|5.0|Please tell me there will be a sequel.  Loved, loved the funny, quirky Sky. I so thought I knew where this book was going and was floored when I read the twists and turns and discovered the truth.  I admit to not being able to put this book down and had a burning desire to finish it all in one day.  Love, love it when that happens!!!!!  Recommending to my friends as a must read.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|I really Bruno Mars's style, sound and approach to music.<br />He's versatile, funky, soulful and knows how to keep you listening.<br />I HATE 99% OF MUSIC MADE AFTER 1995...but there's hope!<br />Thank you Bruno and Damian...you made my week.<br /><br />Yadi Alamin
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|I like this series, Season 3 continues the story. I will watch this one through, after that I may tire of the uniqueness of Downton Abbey.
B007M6P01O|4.0|I guess I was one of the few that thought season 1 was pretty lame.  Atrocious dialogue, boring and awkward characters, and not much excitement.  Furthermore, I thought each episode of Season 1 was worse than the previous one.<br /><br />So my expectations were low for this Season, but my wife wanted to watch it and others kept telling me how good the show was.  I agree - this season the characters seemed to find themselves and have some personality, the writing and dialogue become sharper, and the overall story line was compelling.  I bet they got some new writers in, because it is truly a better crafted show than it was during Season 1.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the book.  It goes well with the movie Zero Dark Thirty. Would highly recommend.  Gives a better understanding of what are troops actually go through in Iraq and Afghanastan compared to what the media tells us,
B00AESN8XY|5.0|It is fun trying to find ways to destroy humanity. Brutal mode is the most challenging and you definitely have to use good strategy to win. Neurax worm is interesting, you don't destroy humanity, you control them and the Necroa virus is really fun if you enjoy creating zombies .... There are a few extra plagues and genetic modifications that are available for purchase, but if you have patience you can unlock all of the new plagues by winning the lower plagues on brutal and the mods unlock by winning the games as you go along. You start the game off with bacteria,virus,fungus,parasite,prion,nano-virus and bio-weapon. Once you beat all of these on brutal, you gain neurax worm. You get necroa virus by beating neurax on brutal. The genetic modifications are easier to unlock because you can get them by beating any of the levels. There are also cheats plagues available that you gain over time such as Immune, Hidden and Unlimited.<br /> The only frustrating part is that game updates tend not to be ready on Google Play for a month or more after it is released to Apple and it can take longer for it to be available on Amazon. This is not the game developers fault since he does have an outside source creating the Android updates. I'm still giving 5 stars for playability.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book kept my interest all the way through it is hard to put down. Great reading and easy to follow.
145210655X|5.0|This is such a great book! Our two boys aged 5&7 love this book, and ask to have it read to them every night. It is one of those rare books that is suited to adults as well as young children...the kids giggle and the adults chuckle too! Of course, our kids are huge Star Wars fans, so that helps! The situations are so akin to what it is like to raise a child...very cute book, highly recommended!! I should note it is also a great size for kids to hold....our seven yr old takes it to bed with hime every night.
B0025KVLTW|5.0|My favorite Beatle album.These songs are so weird yet they just all seem to flow perfectly.It probably is the last album when they all were together in the studio recording together other than the uninspired Let it Be album.Dont get me wrong i love the white album and Abbey Road but there are few songs on both those albums where they were together recording in fact they couldnt stand to be in the same room together during those 2 and let it be.Take the Tour!!
B004J1DBJI|3.0|if you want to use wolfram alpha use a computer, it's just too difficult on a tablet. not that bad of an app but it doesn't belong.
1426209584|4.0|Overall, the book was good. Some the color clarity in the pictures was not as good because they pictures were magnified too<br />big.  If they do a revision, some of the pictures should be made a smaller instead of full page so it gives better definition. Again, overall, I really liked it over the video because it showed a lot more of the birds. To me, the video was not as bad as people wrote about it because I like to know the workings of how things are done behind the scenes, along with the effort, hard work, and sacrifice these men went through to bring what they did. I know the hard work just in editing alone. The video and the book compliment each other; I would buy them together if given as a gift.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I want to know when the 0.6.0 update is coming out on this because apple devices already have the update.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Bruce is back with his in-your-face swashbuckling political commentary!<br /><br />His best album since Born in the USA. Must have it!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I liked this story of survival and living by your wits. One thing I found missing was taht the psychological problems of being alone for so long were ignored.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|The batteries are holding up well so far, but I haven't used them much.  They came packaged as pictured, some other reviewers got unmarked batteries.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|This is my first Scarpetta novel; I decided to read it when it was recommended in one of my magazines (sorry, don't recall which one). I have to say I really liked it. The plot is twisted and intriguing, the characters are complex, and the book keeps your attention throughout. I'll definitely try some of the other novels in this series.
B009CCBCU4|4.0|I look forward to the next book of the series, very good character development and I learned a bit about some of the history in this part of the world...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is intense at times, bought tears to my eyes at times, and as a mother, I could relate to it on a number of levels. It draws the reader in, and you never anticipate how the story will end.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app just updated on the iPad 0.6.0 and it is awesome!!!!!! Get this app I, am 100 percent sure you will loves it!!!!!!!!!!!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Great book. It is better then the movie. It is more in-depth and gives better insight to each character. Read it.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|Great CD.  Can't go wrong with anything from ZZ Top!  Great selection of music on this site.  Will definitely check here for our next music purchase.
B005M2A4DE|4.0|Had it better packaging I'd Have given it 5 stars. (my &#34;Mel Brooks Collection&#34; has more discs 7 or 8 and is in a &#34;standard blue&#34; Blu-ray case designed to hold all discs yet takes up 700-75% of the width on my shelf)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is very much worth every penny and a great watch and education on how life was with the ending of the elite living and aristocracy era.  Now titles are just that &#34;titles&#34; and no longer the unlimited access of living a luxurious life without basically earning it or being a trustfund baby who's had atleast one ancestor that sweat and earned the life of luxury.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I loved the dictionary it had all kinds of ways to get to the word I wanted and I could choose any font it was perfect.
B0014BY72Q|4.0|I read the book as a young person and loved it. I saw the movie many years later. Even though it's definitely got that wicked 70's vibe, it's still a good movie and captures the essence of the original story. It's a dark look at humanity's attempt to deal with an overpopulated and over-used world in a creative twist.<br />Enjoy it.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|This rendition of A Christmas Carol is one of my favorites. It has enough humor, but enough solid acting and creative art to make a thoroughly engaging, witty and poignant Christmas tale that Dickens himself would have been proud of. Great work by all. A new classic.
0345803493|5.0|I wasnt too impressed with part one, I didnt see the BIG hype surrounding it. Now, book #2 is MUCH better, more intense, wayyyy more suspenseful!!!!!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|THE BEST SEARCH ENGINE I COULD FIND LOVE IT THE BEST SEARCH ENGINE I COULD FIND LOVE IT THE BEST SEARCH ENGINE I COULD FIND LOVE IT
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's lots of fun, a great way to pass the time! I want a way to double your coins sometimes without having to buy it!
0765325950|5.0|I haven't quite finished it yet but it is great so far. I love the whole series snd own it. I really loved Robert Jordan's work and love Brandon Sanderson's work also.
B002QW7AJY|3.0|I think this is a good movie.  Dennis Quaid is great at playing an astronaut who goes insane.  Nobody can act as insane as Quaid can.  What is interesting about this movie is that your perception of where the ship is turns out to be wrong at the end of the movie.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Yet another gem of a book from Kate Morton.  Kept me wondering right up until the end.  Highly recommend to all fans of British historical novels.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Wasn't very well written, great story though.  Fascinating to read how the seals work.  Very exciting.  Hard to put down.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I  am surprised by how much I've come to care about even the minor characters, and was immersed in the world created here. Collins has a clean, vivid style that packs a wallop, and it's a great feeling to really enjoy a book that can remind me of why I first fell in love with books when I started reading as a kid.
1612680011|5.0|I highly recommend this book, I've learned sooo much from it. This book shed light on subjects I always wanted to understand, plus it's very easy to read. This book will help me so much in the future :)
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Good alternative to browsing Facebook away from your computer.  I have a BlackBerry phone and I've found its Facebook browser uncomfortable (too small and slow).  This application worked very well and looked great in my Kindle Fire HD.
0765316889|5.0|my husband is following the series and loves this author and the world he has created.He is reading more from this author.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is the story of two star-crossed lovers that is filled with magic and how they pour themselves into a circus to connect with each other.<br /><br />If you like gorgeous descriptions of places you wish you had dreamed up, this is the perfect book.
0765316897|5.0|he has finished the series and is looking forward to any future work from this author. he is a fan of Robert Jordan who has passed and this author finished the Jordan series
B009NOVCTM|5.0|I chose this rating, because this CD is fantastic. It has a lot of really good music, all of their hits, and the Stones are the best. I recommend it for adults, and young teens.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is great I have only one problem it is too addictive so I end playing for ages I have other stuff to do lol
B003XF1OJK|5.0|If you like halo, a must read. Great story about how he became spartan 117. Eric Nylund knows what's up.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Amazing book!!!!!!<br />A must read for anyone that likes a good story of adventures and good tales.<br />Truly amazing!!<br />Loved it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow free is a fun and addictive game. The first few levels are extremely easy so that you can get the hang of how the game works. Then each level gets gradually more difficult. This is a great game to play while waiting in the doctor's office!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|With over 500 reviews on this movie, I can't add much.  No spoilers here, but most people browsing these reviews will probably have at least some idea of the general plot. It's a powerful movie. I knew the whole story in advance and still was moved (I mean I knew the real story, not the screen adaptation, and for the most part wasn't really surprised... but it made an impact nonetheless).  As some of the negative reviews have mentioned, there are a few plot elements that aren't very believable, but the screenplay writers should get some slack in that regard--they were trying to stick somewhat close to the original series of events.  I thought the first part of the movie would drag along, but it moved fairly quickly and kept me engaged.  There's enough at the beginning to see that Hachi and the Richard Gere character form a close bond.  Interestingly, at the beginning I felt there wasn't really a lot of character development with the dog, but that started to change as the movie progressed.  The dog really is the central character in the movie, as is probably obvious from the title and relative prominence given to beast vs. human(s) on the DVD cover.<br /><br />I do disagree with the one-star reviewers who say the movie depicts gross animal cruelty--I can imagine something close to this happening, especially if the dog was fairly aloof, as this one seemed to be, except for his master.  The peripheral human characters in the film aren't cruel toward Hachi, even if they don't meet all of his potential needs or wants.<br /><br />Take seriously the admonition to have tissues on hand and consider the potential impact on anyone you might watch it with or give it to.  Some may not want to watch something like this.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This version of Solitaire is average at best. I like to play different versions of Solitaire, but this game only gives you one version. I do like the options that they give you to change the background and the backs of the cards. They also allow you to change from one card at a time to three cards at a time. If you only have a few minutes to kill, this game is fine.
0470913029|4.0|Loren Cordain has lots of really great information which flies in the face of many diets and what medical professions and nutritionists advocate. This is not a fad diet. This is serious stuff and worth taking seriously. He presents his case on why we as a country are suffering from so many health problems and why we as a nation are so obese. The trend is definitely going in the wrong direction. The Paleo Diet is worth trying, not just a little bit, but really taking this on if you want to maintain/regain your health. Why the medical profession, nutritionists and other health care professionals and people who value their health aren't paying attention is a mystery.<br /><br />If you care about your health and want to prolong your life, buy and read this book.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I am a very avid reader of many types of books, but love the romance novels.  Ok, so it's pretty predictable but I just adored this book.  A very fast read & lots of fun.  Can't beat a free, good read.  :-)
B00B1MHA18|4.0|Good album, Ben's far out experiments in the past don't move me like this one.<br />Good job by Ben & the Old Man.
B005I6EU48|5.0|I love it and would have no problem recommending it for purchase. I also get nice compliments on the cover.
B008NEMPTO|4.0|This movie exceeded my expectations; I wasn't sure what to expect after the trailers. The 3D was better at the theater but still fun to watch at home.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like that this calculators puts in commas!  And you can make an error and clear the error without having to start your calculations all over.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|When you talk to someone on Facebook, how do you know that person is really who they say they are?  Anyone can create a profile.  And anyone can put tons of digital pictures online.  Besides that, you only have words.<br /><br />This movie explores that.  The narrator develops a relationship with a woman he met on the Internet.  However, she is reluctant to meet him, despite sharing phone calls, many text messages, and Facebook messages.<br /><br />What he finds is very surprising.  Suffice it to say he finds she is not what she portrayed herself as.  The feelings of hurt and betrayal are real, since we hope any genuine human interaction is based on honesty and trust.<br /><br />The movie itself is a bit slow in some spots, but it is very interesting watching how Nev (the narrator) tries to uncover the real person he has been talking to on Facebook and phone for so long.<br /><br />Also, the movie spawned a TV series on MTV, of the same name.  The narrator receives many e-mails from people who are in his situation -- they have people they want to meet, potentially romantically, who never seem to be able to meet.  In some cases, this has stayed strictly online for years.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I like mystery seek and find games and this one was interesting.  There was a lot of back and forth between locations and I did need the help button a lot just to give me an idea of which direction to go but I really enjoyed the game.  The puzzles were challenging without being too difficult.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Eventually I had to cheat to finish the last couple clues. But it was fun to unlock the passages and not being a game player, found it fun.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it was ok but it was also a little boring. sure games like this are fun but they all are just too easy
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this period piece soap opera.  Acting is superb and I look forward to seeing the next season!  Worth every penny for the rental!
0547884591|4.0|Past philosophy, part humor, part cooking, this is a fun book.  I tried some of the recipes including the sauerkraut and had success with them.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not stop reading this book. I kept it in my room so I would do the daily house hold chores without any interruptions.
1400067820|5.0|This book has so many implications and facets, it makes my head spin (figuratively not literally like the Exorcist!).<br /><br />The fact that many of the \\"establishment\\" from science, economics, politics, education, etc. refuses to even consider that Taleb's ideas have validity, shows how the closed mindset of many of the over-educated masses is warped.<br /><br />Because this book can be applied to many facets (some of which mentioned above under the \\"establishment\\") and can be applied at a macro or micro level, everyone should read it (or at least incorporate the class into core curriculum).<br /><br />For those who liked the Black Swan, this book represents the logical procession of taking it to the next level but is understandable without reading the Black Swan first.<br /><br />The bottom line is the application of the Antifragile principles to approach, planning, etc. would have far reaching positive implications.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Hurry up with 0.6.0!!! Apple and android already have it!!!!!!!!!!! I played it on iPod but it's not even comparable to my kindle!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|If you like the original Temple Run and similar games, then this is right down your alley. The game is responsive and smooth on both the  Kindle Fire and Nexus 7.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|great reading, good triology,  too bad there won't be any more, as he died before finishing any more books.  will share.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I downloaded this game primarily for my 7 y/o daughter, but my wife and I have really enjoyed it also. We have it on the Kindle Fire, Nexus 7, and mini iPad.
B0015DROBO|5.0|great #2, kept you reading until the end, glad I bought number 3, although I haven't had time to read it yet
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|As usual,, couldn't stop watching until the VERY end... Loved the fact that I could watch the entire season before it even aired on our local PBS..
B005723JSQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down I just wanted to keep reading. It's romantic and adventurous type of story. :) !
B00129H7VS|5.0|I've got the standard DVD box set as well, but, playing the blu-ray version where get the men of Easy company explain what was going on (via picture in picture) at the time, is well worth the purchase price.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a blast! When you start playing it you can't stop! It's like temple run but it's definitely worth buying!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It will keep you interested in the entire book. So many twist and the ending was totally mind blowing. Great book.
B00992CF6W|3.0|know this game is cool don't get me wrong if you want minecraft its pretty close and fun.why I say pretty is because you don't have redstone.so you can basically get rid of cool redstone stuff but if there's a update then its fun but different from the traditional minecraft.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|This was a fabulous movie about one of my all-time favorite characters. I had to explain a lot to my father when we saw the movie, so if you have any questions about the character or the movie, just ask me! It was about time they made a movie about this classic superhero, and I'm glad they did. It was better than the reviewers said it was. Ryan Reynolds was a terrific Green Lantern, and the special effects were fabulous. Stick around for about the middle of the ending credits for one last scene. The DVD extras were good too. This is a good movie for the entire family to enjoy.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Have several Andrea Bocelli's CD's.  This is truly the best for us.....combining pop with classics makes it magical.  Saw him on QVC, & ordered it on Amazon as I am a Prime member.  He never disappoints....What an inspiration he is.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Annoying reading plans. Cannot alter them to fit. Do not exchange info cross platform. Deleted plan accidently. Cannot restart in middle
1451695195|5.0|My husband read this as I got it for him.  He said it was well written & made him feel more comfortable about dying.
B0058RCVYS|5.0|This movie sucked me in from the very beginning.  It was rich in emotion with excellent characters who did an outstanding job.  I was sad to see this movie come to an end.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this is a good app it gets me up on time for school every day you will love it so get it
B0028MBKVG|5.0|As an endurance runner, this was like reading the history of my past.  I have met many of the people mentioned in the book, and it really made me consider my own running career.  Well written, and takes you into a new world.
B000TU16GS|5.0|I think this book is great  it has some sneaky parts. I just think the worst part about it is .... that it's not a movie
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The graphics and responsiveness of this app are a great improvement over an already impressive game. Much better and more innovative than I had been expecting.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book was awesome!  It was well written and very entertaining.  I loved all the encounters Cheryl had.  Gosh, wish I had her courage.  Great book!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife and I have watched this since the beginning and it never let's us down in quality and story-line!
B000VDDWDS|5.0|This was a fabulous movie.  There may have been one bad word, but that was all.  I loved the scenes of the ocean and water and boat sailing.  The story was heartrending and uplifting at the same time.
B005LAIHZE|3.0|The movie had a decent thing going at the very beginning but as for the part of him evolving into a vampire AND a politician, it could be better. It felt like the movie was a little rushed and it left out tons of the history behind this great president. The movie SHOULD have focused majorly on just the vampire stuff and maybe have made more battle scenes and more on him becoming the vampire hunter. If the movie had ended with him in the end as president that would of been much better...The fact that he comes back as an old guy and the president (Who, even in that time would of been watched everywhere) to hunt vampires and save the country makes you question what the hell is this? If they kept him as young Abraham for the whole movie and in the end shows that was in his past BEFORE he was president, I would be giving this 5 stars..
B000VOC90Y|4.0|When I spent almost $70 on this backpack, I expected Hermes' to be jealous. However, in large, I am disappointed. I will keep to the absolutes of the bag in this review.<br /><br />-The straps are positioned on the bag in a VERY non-optimal way. The weight distribution is off, and makes what you're carrying feel much heavier. I'm not just a whiny brat, this is an actual problem with the bag, and the problem that's contributed the most towards it being a disappointment. However, it is comfortable, for being so poorly designed.<br />-The available space inside is misleading from how HUGE it is. I'm a gangly 6 foot teenager, and it looks like I'm wearing a tortoise shell. That would normally be fine if I could fit more than my laptop and two binders in it. I try for a textbook, and it starts moaning.<br />-The quality seems good where it counts-- the straps and handles and zippers. However, the little things have apparently been neglected. There's a mesh bag hanging in the laptop compartment, meant for little things. The velcro on the strap that wraps over the laptop has damaged the mesh material so bad there's holes in it. Thank goodness it's too small to really hold anything.<br />-Speaking of too small to hold everything, that's how most of the compartments feel.<br /><br />*HOWEVER, I bought this bag to keep my $1000 laptop safe. It does just that. I would feel comfortable with it falling 6 feet onto concrete, with it landing any which way. I suppose the protective components is what takes up so much room. So, I'm satisfied.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good game for horse lovers. Very realistic graphics. I would recommend this game to my horse loving friends. Thank you.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|We (my daughter and I) have read every book and love all of them.  She is 10 years old now and does not enjoy reading as much as she used to, but these books always keep her attention...and she will reread them over & over again.  :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so fun it has new features like zip lines and  waterfalls and much more better then the first one
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The quality of graphics is outstanding. Its very addictive. My kids are always on it. This replaces Angry Birds for them.:)
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This is without a doubt the worst app I have used in the 1 1/2 years that I have had my Kindle. The only time it works is when you open it immediately after downloading it. I deleted and downloaded it twice and the same thing kept happening!! It looked like a great update from the original but it isn't any fun if it DOESN'T WORK!?#$%
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Great. Fun to play. Only complaint is that you have to buy the full version.althogh it was a little creepy
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love angry birds dont get me wrong we have all the games we have tons of the toys and we play them all the time<br />i cant get enough of this game i say its the best game ever i have NO problem with the game<br />however Rovio the company they really dont care on the latest update it seems you get ads added to your app even if you paid for the<br />ad free version<br /><br />dont waste your time Rovio wont update this its been two months since an update even though you pay for it<br />but they update facebook with new versions everyday<br />Rovio doesnt care about anything once you pay them your money they would rather bow to facebook then take care of their<br />customers<br /><br />thanks alot Rovio I used to be a huge fan untill you showed just how little you care.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|This CD has many delightful songs, clearly written from experiences of growing up in the South (Georgia), be it love, wisdom, getting in trouble, making amends, humor...and they play so well together.  Had a chance to see them in concert this year and it was fabulous!  Run to buy this CD!  The songs stay with you in the best of ways.
B00913P6G0|4.0|Good good tight spectacularly good great like hot fire love good music great nice better over all this is a good cd YA BISH
B006LSZECO|3.0|i was VERY INTO this book.  A page turner.. but at the end I felt kind of ANNOYED that I read all those pages for that s****y ending.
0345803485|3.0|I first saw this book and thought it looked interesting, before I learned what it was really about, once i started reading it was pretty good and a bit steamy; but as you get further into the story there seems to be a lot of repition.  I was no longer interested in the physical scenes but the actual story.  I have read all 3 of these books and must say that about half way through the second book the story line starts to get a bit crazy and jumping around.  I feel like EL James tried to create twists and turns similarly to Dan Brown's books and keep us all on our toes, but it just turned into too much drama from a young woman.<br /><br />If you want to read a \\"chic flick\\" style romance novel, this is great, but if your looking into this for its hot reputation try somethign else, im sure there are much better out there.
B0015AARJI|5.0|era tal cual como lo esperaba,rapido y muy buen servicio,y buen producto muchas gracias excelente<br /> recomendado 100% confiable y eficas
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I LUV this app. It's all about strategy. Most of all it's FUN. a friend recommended it to me and I'm glad I joined the fight against the zombies.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Typical Nicholas Sparks book. However, the ending definitely throws you for a loop! Everything was tied up nicely. I definitely recommend it :) can't wait to see the movie.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|not as good as the first one ............. slow ,hard,not as much characters,boring, and it gets even worse thwn that
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Not much to say other than just as amusing as the first one maybe more I love it and so does all of my friends :)
B003TSEL7S|3.0|It wasn't too exciting but it's still a good book. This is a children's book and I'm not to fond of children books
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I don't use one very often, but this is easy to use as well as see.  It will be handy when away from home.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is pretty good if you want a simple calculator to help you with your math. I didn't find anything wrong with it, so it's worth a try.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I totally love this game! I'm a big Call of Duty fan and was hesitant to play this but WOW do I love it. the graphics are awesome and playing a first person shooter in your hands rather then on a tv really makes a difference! you really feel like your apart of the game! best game ever!!!
B003I0CYGM|3.0|Brought these to replace the ones that I had lost. Fit well. No problems and the price was very good. They arrived on time as promised.
B003QWRA3Y|3.0|I thought this movie was alright. It was a little confusing and a bit taboo. but i guess it just isn't my taste.
1586212222|4.0|The below is a review of the abridged audiobook edition of the book<br /><br />The author is quite humorous and his humor is quite witty, sardonic, satiric and sarcastic. The author's voice carries his humor quite well hence the audiobook is also a pleasure to read. The type of humor, however it should be stressed, is not the bright happy type. It is definitely the dark type, filled with melancholy. Many of the stories told involved children being killed in a variety of manners, including in a clothes dryer. Hence for a holiday themed book maybe a little too much for some people. Still quite funny in its own way though.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Fan of Mr King since my high school days but this is the first of his stories I have read in a long time. I say story because that's what it is, a story. Anyone can write a book but Mr King tells stories, and this is a great one!  I'm glad I found you again sir.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Almost three centuries have passed since those final Hunger Games and the last of the Wars of Rebellion against the Capitol. We look back and understand clearly the legacy of Katniss Everdeen, famous for her moniker as the \\"Mockingjay\\". Certainly, she was a charasmatic figure in her own time, greatly influencing the course of the war and the immediate political aftermath. Yet, what contemporary observers could not have foreseen was how completely her actions and memoirs would transform the political and social landscape for succeeding generations. As a \\"tribute\\" in the Hunger Games she was seen merely to be fighting for her family and her district. On another level, however, this was a transcendent struggle for the underlying guiding principles of courage, love and fairness; that ultimately triumph over the prevailing social values of subservience, greed and disparity. \\"Mockingjay\\" is the last of Katniss's personal accounts of the events that take place in the latter part of the War of the Second Rebellion. Her actions in the Games are a matter of public record. All of Panem's citizens are familiar with the Mockingjay propoganda videos produced by the Rebels. Yet, in her personal diaries, Katniss Everdeen reveals a multi-layered and complex personality, both caring and compassionate as well as intelligent and highly analytical. She continuously re-evaluates and reassesses the changing social and political environments. Never intimidated by the rich and powerful, nor awkward or embarrassed amid the poor and lowly, she treats everyone on an equal level and holds them all, including herself, accountable to the same justice. Early skepticism by military leaders, like Commander Paylor (later President) and General Boggs, turns to awe and admiration as she displays poise and selflessness in real-life combat. \\"Mockingjay\\" is a mesmerising read. We experience first-hand the unremitting state of mind as close friends and allies perish one by one in the wartime chaos. But, she has the uncanny knack for seizing the opportunities to make a difference. She does not waver. Who are we but the legacy of the Mockingjay! Those pangs of conscience over which she so painfully agonized. Why? The debt has been repayed a thousandfold!
B008L5G4I8|3.0|Although I found this mystery interesting, it was more from an historical/intellectual point of view than from a really exciting mystery point of view.  It was Christie's first foray into mystery writing and does presage much that she will do much better in the development of her mystery tales later on.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great read, was hooked from the beginning to end.. Few great twists in storyline. Would recommend to everyone. Deserves the 5stars.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Nice sequal alot better graphics and much better game play.  like the bigger monkey and love the power ups that you can activate one you grab enough coins.  keep going with those improvements
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Love these books. Am totally addicted to what happens next.. You get a great insight to Christian in this book, it's all good.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Since I have a 3 and almost 5 year old it's hard to do puzzles because, obviously, I don't want my kids to get into the pieces. This app enables me to  do puzzles that take longer than 5 minutes.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Great read after the first 2 books. Very addictive, and a great insight into Christian in the last chapter. Can't wait for another one to come out.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik can be boring  but fun well anyone that is bi or lez  add me . I.d I'd luvprinceton1234 . Only girls boys yes u will be deleted
B007L3BMGA|5.0|The first of 3, it's a great read & very addictive. Read this on holiday & couldn't put the book down. No wonder there's a baby boom on at moment..
B008C20TDG|5.0|I love, love, love this book! When I decided to do the Whole 30 I have to admit that I was a little intimidated. It was easy at first but I knew the time would come when I would have to fight off some pretty intense cravings. That's where this book comes in. Understanding how certain foods affect our bodies has been key for me in my Whole 30 success. Knowing how these foods affect our hormones, emotions, chemical reactions and basically every other thing that goes on in our complex systems has made me not even want to consume any of the foods on the &#34;DO NOT EAT&#34; list. When I even think about having a craving (usually just a little something sweet) I just imagine what's going to happen once it's inside my body and it's not even worth it. I HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone that's considering embarking on this Whole 30 journey. I don't recommend trying it without it!
B004DM0UII|5.0|I use this app just about everyday- I have no complaints about it whatsoever. You can have your cake and eat it too. (and let me tell you, it has some great songs. I even found some new bands on certain stations.)
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book gives great step by step advice on how to make sure your Kindle book looks the way you expect it to once you press &#34;publish&#34;. It covers a lot of things I wouldn't have thought of if I hadn't read this.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Big Bang Theory ranks as one of my all time favorite sitcoms -- right up there with MTM, MASH and Cosby -- all are shows which can be watched repeatedly for the enjoyment of the excellent comic ensemble and wonderful comic timing.  All the really good shows have good writers and Big Bang is no exception.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Even better than the first two books. Probably because I'm becoming more familiar with all the characters. Abrupt changes in characters keeps catching me off guard. I like being surprised.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Love this movie. Of course, the actors are incredible, love Meryl Streep. Tommy Lee Jones did an aweson job as well. But the story line was what got me. If you are middle aged and have been married awhile, you will totally get this movie!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app really is nice. Does exactly what it claims to do.  Only complaint is it would be nice if nav bar showed % of remaining battery rather than just battery image.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|good game. had fun with it for awhile but all of the levels blur together after awhile. but mildly entertaining.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game is fun, has great graphics, and is simple to use. The only problem I have us that the gens are hard to earn.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|good action movie. lots of good actors. not the best movie I have ever watched but definitely entertaining. worth watching once.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Love this series, I just wish it didn't cost so much! P.s. Captian Hook is a very good looking pirate!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I love love love love love this book. My favorite book EVER! I wish I could give it 6 stars!!!!
0140135154|5.0|This is one of the best books about art history I've ever read. John Berger is a genius and his ideas are never more important than today when images are so easily accessible on the internet and saturate our culture so heavily. I definitely recommend reading this to anyone who likes art, but feels that it is inaccessible, and to anyone who happens to be reading this review. Read this book!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|could play it fine 4 a week nut now it cancels out.whenever I play. It sucks, they need to fix it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Easy access to social networking site. Able to get in touch with friends at any time from any where and when I want.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Convincing view of what it is like emotionally for a child growing up in foster care/group homes. Very good story that holds one's interest.<br /><br />Ending is satisfying, though maybe not very realistic. Also the boyfriend character is not fully developed.<br /><br />If not for these flaws I would rate this five stars. It has a strong main character, as well as some interesting minor characters, and the theme of communicating through flowers and their meanings is lovely and unusual.
B005TTEFRG|4.0|This kept us entertained for an afternoon. Much better than the Arnold flicks. I would like to see a sequel.
0307887448|5.0|\\"Ready Player One\\" by Ernest Cline is a book written specifically for me ... or at least it feels that way.  My wife asked, \\"So you're really reading a novel about ... playing video games?\\"  And I answered, \\"Yeah.  Isn't it awesome?\\"<br /><br />The plot is very simple and easy to follow.  James Halliday was a gaming genius, multi-billionaire, and creator of the multiplayer online virtual reality world called OASIS.  The book opens with James' death.  In his will, he announces that he has hidden an Easter Egg somewhere inside of OASIS.  The first person to find the Egg will inherit his entire fortune.<br /><br />What follows is a mad race to find the three keys that would open the gates to find the Egg.  Think \\"It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World\\" meets \\"TRON.\\"<br /><br />The book also has thousands of 1980s references, which is understandable, considering that was the era during which computer gaming first became big.  So, not only did I enjoy the game, but I enjoyed reliving parts of my own past.  And I even felt proud for being a geek.<br /><br />Because of the simple prose and simple plot, the book is a very fast, enjoyable read.  My only complaint is that it had to come to an end.  Though, there are a few hints near the end of a sequel.  Ernest is currently working on a different story called \\"Armada.\\"  Perhaps it will occur inside of OASIS, but we'll see when that book comes out.<br /><br />As I read \\"Ready Player One,\\" I kept an eye out for a possible Easter Egg by Ernest himself.  My not-so-diligent search came up empty, but I learned after the fact, that he did indeed put in an Easter Egg.  Those who found it were led to a website where they were tasked to find three gates, and the person who finished first won a Delorean complete with a flux capacitor.  Dude!<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this book for younger children, as there are f-bombs (no more than 10) and a few brief adult situations mentioned, though I'm not sure why they were included.  Other than that, today's kids would love this book.<br /><br />If you're an older geeky \\"kid\\" like me who loves video games, then this book is required reading.  Pick it up today and enjoy the read.today's kids would love this book.<br /><br />If you're an older geeky \\"kid\\" like me who loves video games, then this book is required reading.

B0098VYKSA|1.0|This movie wandered all over. It definitely didn't hold my interest. Buyer beware. I don't usually rate movies but wanted to help out in this case.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great! It's entertaining and teaches responsibility. I think it's a good way to show kids that responsibility is fun and easy!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Easy to use and the sleep feature associated with the flap is great. A great all purpose protector and travel case.
B001ECDVKE|5.0|At first glance, I thought this movie was going to be so-so. Next, I wondered what all those well known actors & actresses saw in the script. I actually watched it because I had nothing better to do at the time, and it was too cold to ride. What a great surprise this one is!  A true hidden gem! Burton and company hit this one out of the park! WAY out! Very funny, and dark at the same time. What a blast! What a cast! I'm gonna order another copy since I don't remember who borrowed my last one, and nobody will fess up (guess I don't blame them). It's definitely a keeper!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I've only used this for sleeping and it is awesome, especially if you can pump it through an external speaker.  The combinations of sounds and ability to tweak volumes individually puts this app far above any other I've tried.
B003L5HLSA|5.0|I love it!!! Damian Marley and Nas are great.  One of the best albums I have purchased in a long time. :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have become hopelessly hooked on this lil game app!  I cannot seem to put it down.  Fun way to pass some time.  Great game..especially being free.  I'm not a game player, but..when I played it the very first time, I was addicted and couldn't put it down.  I really enjoy the first player action...feels like I'm actually running and dodging the obstacles. And you don't have to buy coins with real money to advance. Love this game! :)
B001I8A76A|5.0|I love this album!  There is a nice balance of fast songs and slow ballads.  Her voice is amazing.  Pink is awesome!!!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series! I am sad there is only 8 episodes!  It is to long between seasons! So very entertaining!
B0077PHNWO|5.0|I heard that description and had to laugh...makes sense.<br />A well constructed, massive, anthemic wall-of-sound recording.<br />It's consistent all the way through. Very Well done.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book with twists and turns.<br />Happy and sad (brought tears) but its a beautiful love story.<br />Highly recommend, great characters.
0060557818|4.0|For once the cover blurb was right--the cover of this fantasy novel said it was \\"A dark contemporary Alice in Wonderland.\\" That's a good description, except for the \\"dark\\" part.<br /><br />Gaiman's hero, Richard Mayhew, does not fall down the rabbit hole, but through the cracks, so to speak, into the literal underworld of London. It all begins when he and his fiance stumble over a girl on the street, who is covered in blood. Taking her back to his apartment, over the protests of his fiance, Richard finds that he has inadvertently involved himself in the tangled affairs of an alternate London, the one existing in the sewers and abandoned subway tunnels beneath the city. And things get curiouser and curiouser.<br /><br />Richard becomes involved in a Quest, to find the murderers of the rescued girl's family and to win back his normal life in the London Above. Along the way he meets rats who communicate with humans; the Velvet Lamia, a vampire-like seductress; the Angel Islington, who had once been the overseer of lost Atlantis; the amazon-like Hunter, who specializes in killing the giant beasts in the underworlds of the great cities; and Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar, two bloodthirsty hired killers, one learnedly sarcastic and the other a straight-man who likes to eat live animals (the Abbott and Costello of London Below).<br /><br />All this adventure and mayhem is written in a whimsical style, so that the reader is never actually terrified and always retains confidence that the hero will survive. Its tone is somewhat similar to that of Douglas Adams in The Hitchhiker's Guide series, though Gaiman is not quite as clever as Adams. Nevertheless, the book is often very humorous and features many memorable one-liners.<br /><br />The story itself is interesting, coherent, and somewhat suspenseful. It is almost like a Stephen King alternate-world novel, written in an entirely different tone, which means that character development and that creepy King feeling is absent.<br /><br />This is a very well done and amusing read.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|This woman is amazing! I wish she could have released this sooner.<br />I love the acoustic versions of the songs.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|fun little game. nice graphics. reminds me of Mario. platform game. shoot. jump. stay alive. would rate it 5 stars if it was completely unique.
B008133MDK|5.0|Sherlock is one of the most exciting and addictive TV shows around. Cumberbatch is great and Freeman brings one down to earth as the average joe, and levels out Sherlocks brilliance. So much better then all the spinoffs such as the Downey JR version, etc.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Okay, let's be honest. We have all been through the teenage angst of the rumor mill, and what role we play in our own little world. This movie portrays, though slightly exaggerates, the drama every teen endures: love, religious certainty, basic fundamental views on right and wrong, and popularity- among more. Emma Stone is flawless, as always. Her witty character's charming relationship with her parents just makes this movie a must see.<br /><br />Product was amazingly wrapped and shipped. Super quick timing. Love it!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a fun-filled action-packed game that kids love!My friends were the ones to tell me about this game,and they said that Subway Surfers is AWESOME!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Fun game to kill time with.Typical in that to get the best weapons you do have to spend money.But...<br />you can enjoy it without emptying your wallet.Storyline is a little boring but still decent.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|This is a great, great soundtrack.  I loved the movie and the soundtrack brings it back.  There is some dialogue from the movie on the soundtrack which works well.  Also, it is a great variety of songs.  I will listen to this soundtrack a lot!

6305428425|5.0|FUNNY - Great family movie! Would recomend to anyone that loves comedy!  I love comedy and if a movie can leave a lasting impression like the part where they are dancing to Cydie Lauper - when I'm feeling silly I will renact it!  SR :)
B005A1ER0I|5.0|Bought this specifically for listening to while playing Guild Wars 2. AMAZING! Mute that game music and crank this for a legendary experience.<br /><br />I like pretty much all the tracks on this CD, though some stand out above the others.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun wish there was a kitten game just like it fairly easy beautiful graphics no need to buy things with real money so far
034580404X|3.0|This series is trash and I would not have purchased it if someone had told me the contents and story line.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I absolutely love this cd! It's the perfect thing to fix a bad day. I listen to it every day on the way to and from work. Thank you Amazon
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is amazing with cool new abilities to fantastic characters and you can slide on ropes jump into mine carts and even cross the most daring bridges
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Love the game...it really makes you think.It is fun to compete with someone else playing it.I play it while watching tv in the evening.
B0073QNIH6|3.0|This is a very cool looking dinosaur and we love that the mouth opens.  But my son broke off the tip of the tail.  It doesn't impact the use of the toy but it's disappointing to him.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fun game that keeps you on your toes, you have to be quick on some of the advanced games! Have fun!
B0034DGPEU|3.0|It was a good read as the characters were very fleshed out but I really felt that it was pretty ho-hum in the plot line.  It kept my interest.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|great game for horse lover's. fun to play! not buggy n they have really very beautiful horses to choose from after the 1st &quot;default&quot; given free from game...like this a lot!
B004HD61KE|5.0|I enjoyed this so much that I recommended it to a friend.  I have been to some of the places mentioned in this book and it just made it better.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Decent game. It's fun and a good way to waste time. As a horse lover I enjoy the virtual pony love. It gets better as you go too, they add more games and such.
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|Quick and witty! Starts a little slow, but really picks up the pace after the first few episodes. Highly recommend.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I liked Threat Vector with the main story being about Jack Ryan, Jr. but it was not as good a story as the previous books that Clancy has written. It is not as fact filled and almost like a short story in comparison.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, its my favorite ever even though its really short, looking forward to the second coming out and glad to own my own copy of it!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This might be waterproof, but it is a thin plastic cover that was already cracked when I got it. It was returned and I would purchase another one.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Ken Follett really is ambitious to begin such  huge project, and this volume features some interesting characters that you care about.  This book does provide insight about WW 1 that I did not know from my sketchy schooling in history. Follett presents a balanced look at that time period.  I look forward to the next volume.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Fantastic book!! My eyes were glued to the page and could not stop reading. Definitely worth the read. Have fun!
B009VB9VKY|5.0|Well I invited all my girlfriends over to watch it and we all loved it :) :)  :) :) :)
B001H9MWW2|5.0|This is a replacement of a Coldplay CD I already owned.I lent it to a friend and<br /> it never got returned to me.I am very happy to have this CD back in my music<br /> collection again!!!!:):)
B0097L29KM|4.0|To begin with I love all the songs - some of the very best Neil has done in a long time. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that this album could have been much improved with a little editing. When I want 20 minutes of feedback I'll lay my guitar aganst my amp turn it on, crank it up to 11 & let it howl away till my neighbors scream at me. On this album the noise sometimes gets in the way of some really great songs. I edited the copy I made to listen to in my car to a single disc & it flows better. Anybody who loves Neil should buy this album but be aware that at places it seems to go on & on & on. Note - because of it's extreme high price this is the 1st Neil Yound album that was available on vinyl that I bought in a different format.
B000002UTI|5.0|I am glad to have this John Lennon CD as part of my collection.<br />I have been enjoying it since it arrived.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Kenny Loggins, Georgia Middleman and Gary Burr are songwriters who have obviously observed, experienced and survived the human condition on this journey of life; as is demonstrated by the depth of the lyrics of absolutely every song on this album.  The range is broad, from tear jerkers to life anthems and fun indiscretions. Blue Sky Riders harmonies are tight and the solos beautiful, with arrangements that are varied yet reminiscent of the Loggins textures and wonderful surprises.  Thank you BSR for 15 songs that speak to my heart.  I am looking forward to more!!!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I am a weather bug kind of guy (61 years old) and have found e-weather app to be the VERY BEST quality in all aspects. (believe me, I've studied many of the weather apps available. I purchased this app on my kindle fire HD and love it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you thought temple run one was awesome than check tout his app! The people at Imangi Studios have really out done themselves this time! I recommend this to everyone!!!
B00454U1NS|4.0|I always enjoy a little Pink.  She and I think a lot alike.  She makes me laugh and sometimes cry.

B009H5IS1W|5.0|Criminal Minds-I love thisprogram. Seeing the unsub (bad guy) arrested.I should be this way in real life.Love Joe Mantegna.The cast work great together.
B0012HRJEA|1.0|The language is &#34;Olde English&#34; but the action was a waste of time. Reckless gun brandishing and firing at will but nothing seems to get hit. No consequences. I fell asleep during the movie
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Still can not download amason app. Store. Set up android tablet to download as told.I 'm sure I did this correctly. It did not download. Maybe not able on android yet.
B005LF9OCE|5.0|Season 7 is just as good as the other seasons. It gets more exciting though because they are getting older and going through more life changes that all of us 30 somethings can relate to.
B0037RDPEG|5.0|Loving this book! revealing for me! I enjoy the way it is organized and its resemblance with the Buddhism beads.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I admit, I watched the movie first, and mainly read the book because I held the firm belief it had to be better. It was certainly different, and better in its own ways. I feel like the movie cleaned up the story well, but the original had a bit more creativity, more adventure, and less cliches.<br /><br />Percy comes of as instantly likeable, though I find it hard to believe that a supposedly dyslexic kid is extremely well-read in mythology. Still, I appreciate what Riordan tried to do for dyslexic and ADHD kids, to make them feel a bit better about themselves. Personally, I'm not a fan of labels, but that's what we do in America, so I applaud him for twisting that around and making it a positive attribute of the characters.<br /><br />Annnabeth was far different from the movie version. She was more sensitive and I enjoyed both her and Grover's backgrounds and goals. That depth was definitely missing from the movie.<br /><br />Rioran did a great job of building the suspense at the end given that everyone expects Percy to become a great hero and fight an evil that even the greatest of gods fear. It gave off a lot of Harry Potter vibes, but the Greek mythology took over for the most part to make it unique. I'm definitely up for reading the rest of the books. I'll just stay away from the movies until I read them.
B00899F0G8|5.0|Pretty Little Liars gets you addicted right from the start. There are so many twists and turns in every single episode. This show keeps you guessing all the time, and every episode you suspect a different character of being guilty of something. Highly Recommended! And if you're a guy who may be skeptical of the show, it's got a great plot and plenty of pretty girls to look at.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I used to ride when I was younger and this is a great substitute without the sore muscles and smelly clothes.
B002RVCD0U|2.0|2009R: Almost a total waste of time to watch and SciFi is my favorite genre. LOVED the previous Terminator flicks, but this one is reminiscent of a bad Mad Max rendition - old, dreary looking sets, lackluster coloration, just plain sucks - depressing even. MFJLabs 2x (rare review for low rating).
1594487154|4.0|I've said it before and I will say it again: Dan Pink is one of the best, if not the best, business writers of our era. After reading Free Agent Nation and A Whole New Mind, I was eagerly anticipating To Sell is Human. And - for the most part - it did not disappoint.<br /><br />About 10, fifteen years ago I heard speaker and author Dan Sullivan distinguish between \\" entrepreneurs\\" and \\" bureaucrats\\" suggesting that as our economy evolves it will be easier to behave like an entrepreneur - regardless of ones occupation. Now comes Pink telling us something similar with a lot more research ( maybe too much research but more on that later)<br /><br />Act one opens with a entertaining story about Pinks visit with Norman Hall, the very last Fuller Brush salesmen, an old fashion Willy Lomen type, who sells door to door in the Bay area. From there, he moves to the basic premise on which the rest of the book will sit: INFORMATION SYMMETRY. Pink argues that in the old days sellers had more information than buyers (INFORMATION ASYMMETRY) But today, with smart phones and such, buyers have as much - or almost as much - information as sellers which results in a shift and a new principal of selling: Caveat venditor ( i.e SELLER beware). It also means we are all is sales now! (or we are all entrepreneurs in Sullivan's lexicon)<br /><br />The core of book the new \\"ABC\\" principles of selling:<br /><br />A: ATTUNEMENT. This is the ability to \\"bring ones actions and outlook into harmony with others\\". Pink enlightens us with 3 ways to attune, the first being to \\"Increase you power by reducing it\\". This is a very Zen like idea which I immediately tested around my spouse and children. I had been squabbling with my spouse recently and when I used this principal things improved. In the end, most marriage problems are probably power struggles and consciously \\"reducing your power\\" can have a positive effect. Same with children, of course easier said than done. Selling is about moving others and family can be more challenging than the toughest customers! The B and C principals are BUOYANCY and CLARITY.<br /><br />Numerous studies are cited throughout the text that (sort of) relate to the new world of sales as well as helpful links and websites for today's salesperson - be it traditional sales or what Pink refers to as \\" non-sales selling\\"<br /><br />The area where Pink can improve, in my view, can be found in the second paragraph on page 138: Less is more.<br /><br />With all his books, study after study is thrown at you and at times it feels like you are being pelted with consecutive first serves from Andy Roddick ( research in liu of tennis balls). And it always seems like the researchers are from Harvard or Stamford - making me feel somewhat inferior having barley scrapped through a state college in five years. I find myself enjoying Pinks work more - and learning more - when he talks about HIS OWN first hand research; like the Fuller visit and later on when he takes a course on \\"Business improvisational theater\\" in New York.<br /><br />But all in all.... Bravo! Valuable lessons to be learned for salespeople, entrepreneurs and anyone that needs to move people...  especially spouses and children!<br /><br />FULL DISCLOSURE : I was not on the said marketing team, hence paid full load for the Hard copy, But did receive some informational goodies for per-ordering. Was a little surprised when I learned how much more you pay when per-ordering a hard copy - didn't have that information in advance, so I guess buyers are not perfectly symmetrical with sellers yet!d family can be more challenging than the toughest customers!

B005EJNAK4|3.0|2009PG13: Decent scifi flick that works because of the strong characters behind the fake looking dummies. Sort of a human nature story with not to subtle undertones of how, because of technology, people are growing more and more distant from one another. Except here they don't blame the internet ... at least not directly! Worth watching. MFJLabs 3.5x
B007L6VR12|5.0|People often complain that Wes Anderson films are too pretentious. While that may be true, Moonrise Kingdom doesn't suffer from it. The movie, about the naivety, adventurousness and rebelliousness of children, is something that many can relate to. It has a beating heart that sets it apart from his other films. As usual, his cast of characters are odd and quirky, but ultimately endearing. The child actors are perfectly cast and do a wonderful job. This is a movie that I can watch again and again and never get bored.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I had no idea these  games existed!  Really fun and challenging.  The graphics are good, no glitches.  I definitely would recommend.
B001A4LYN2|5.0|This movie is all about Daniel Day-Lewis. He occupies 95% of the screen time and is captivating 100% of the time. This is PT Anderson's at his finest - the interesting, often hilarious, side characters, the beautiful cinematography, the pacing and the sets are absolutely perfect. Watching it 5 years after it came out, it already has the feel of a classic movie meant for the ages. Another 15 years from now, people will wonder how No Country for Old Men won Best Picture over this.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I hate this game!! It keep buying stuff adamantly with out me buying it on my own. Dont buy this app!!!!!!
B001NLKT60|5.0|I read The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo & had a hard time getting into it. After awhile I was hooked and when I finished it, I had to start The Girl Who Played With Fire immediately. It is an easier read & will leave you rushing to download the next book in the Millenium trilogy.
B00333NCTM|5.0|Loved it.  Kept me laughing and gave me great insight to the man.  It reads like he's telling you his life story.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|LOVE NICHOLAS SPARKS!<br /><br />GREAT STORIES AND ADVENTURES WITH PEOPLE YOU CAN IDENTIFY WITH<br /><br />GREAT BOOK!!!!<br /><br />ENJOYED EVERY PAGE AND EVERY CHARACTER
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just downloaded and watched the remaining, as of yet unaired episodes of Dowton Abbey, Season 3 on Amazon. This season was by far the best one yet! Many of the events surprised me, both the exciting twists and the tragic. This is one of the best written dramas on television. If you haven't tuned in yet, you're really missing out!<br /><br />The only drawback I can name is that I now have to wait for season four.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is amazingly addictive and a huge improvement on the first.  I highly suggest it. Yay Temple Run you are awesome.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|cool and fun game.  I can not get enough of playtime.  I even play this on my android phone when away
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is a must-see!  Acting and story is superb.  Will continue to watch as Season 3 and Season 4 are introduced to public.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Fun, interesting, and fast; this book is one of Grisham`s best in years.  It`s a journey filled with suspense and twists that I found a great distraction.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Perfect book club choice!! I loved it so much and cannot wait to discuss it with my group!! Such an adventure!
B00936A0ZW|5.0|This is a fun listen.  Gilbert has 4 instrumental numbers for the guitar freaks out there, and he has 4 songs with lyrics for everyone else.  It's the best of both worlds.  His playing is incredible, and his blend of zany humor and in-the-groove licks makes this a very enjoyable CD to spin.  There's also 3 live tracks that demonstrate what a beast Gilbert is on the guitar.  My favorite song is &#34;Vibrato,&#34; but &#34;Enemies (in Jail)&#34; is just as much fun.
B000SFD21Q|4.0|The authors make excellent points but seem to be on the defensive about their conclusions. This results in their stating over and over the same things about their research and how they can defend their premise that there are myriad benefits to exercise, many previously unknown. I think it would have been enough to state their methodology and then get on with it about the benefits they attribute to it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Got to get this book I love it best diary of a wimpy kid you  can get all children are going to love it
1400067820|5.0|This is the rare writer who not only has much to say, but writes in a witty, cleaver way. I never found myself rushing through to get to the point because the way he writes is so rich. He allows the reader to really steep in this concept of &#34;anti fragility&#34; so that it becomes something one has a new relationship with. It's beyond robust, it's  a quality of resilience few have put their finger on until this writer.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I will keep this short and sweet.  The beginning of the book was boring for me.  It wasn't until about mid-way through it that I found myself engrossed in the story.  I finally found myself connecting with the characters.  The author provided profound quotes throughout the book on life and love.  I liked the way he began to toggle back and forth between characters so you got a real sense of what was happening moment by moment.  However, unlike the notebook, this love story had a horrible ending.  I get what the author was trying to do but it left me wanting more and thinking to myself that maybe he got tired of writing and just ended the story.  Amanda's reaction to the final events of the story were anticlimatic and didn't seem natural.  This book definitely had emotional moments but I am still trying to decide how I feel about the whole thing.
0618918248|5.0|Dawkins nails it yet again. Absolutely essential reading for the budding atheist. Also, a good starting point for anyone with questions/doubts about their &#34;faith.&#34; 5 stars.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book is entertaining but very far-fetched. It's enjoyable to read but frustrating at times. Had to find out what the hype is all about.
020530902X|5.0|The book is easy to follow, then you can learn a lot of tips to improve your wringing style.<br />The book is so small that it can be taken anywhere to check your doubts.<br />Recommended for every one who cares about writing.

B006LSZECO|5.0|5 stars. Simply put: this was a page turner. Just when you are a certain you've figured it out... you realize you haven't... and a new thrilling puzzle presents itself.
B009ZFPQOQ|4.0|I've been using this app for a few months and I'm very satisfied with its functionality. Very easy to use although It's not 100% because the maps need to be accessed through the web, it still works. It would be better if maps could be stored locally.
B000A6EXNO|4.0|No way to mount this on the D600. I think there is another attachment that you can buy that allows this to fit on the D600 but not by itself. Nikon needs to make the accessories easier to understand.<br />This is cheap enough that I didn't mind taking the chance.
B0085YNML2|5.0|I won't tell my age,but this adorable game reminds me of my favorite Atari video game - &#34;Pitfall&#34;. There are many levels of play,for hours of amusement, and the game runs on my Thrive seamlessly. I couldn't be more pleased!

B00992CF6W|5.0|this is not a good app at all, because it is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  You should really get it.  But you need wifi to connect with your friend that is the only down side about it.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|This is Hollywood's funniest take on the absurdity of the modern work place. I've watched it dozens of times. Office Space is a classic movie that is definitely worth owning.
B008XNPO20|5.0|This album is really worth the buy.This band has some serious talent! Hope they continue to make more great albums :)
B008DL466C|1.0|This album is so bad I can't even listen to his old album now which I really liked.  He went from fun music to dumb music. Once you listen to this album or try to get through it, you'll realize Wiz was fake the whole time unless the all weed killed his brain cells.  He raps about nothing but money and himself which is such a shame. One word to describle his lastest album, \\"trash\\". I thought he would replace Lil Wayne for the next few years as the big pop rapper but not a chance. His lyrics are beyond horrible. The beats are actually really good, I know a lot of artists that could of made a great album with these beats.  So disappointed.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This was hard & sad to read  and many times throughout the book I had tears in my eyes, but glad she told her story!

B0085KGHI6|5.0|This disc is AWESOME!! Loved seeing the Glimmer Twins & Co. pay tribute to the blues greats on the DVD. Mr. Morganfield is in fine form, and Buddy, Jr., and the rest are just BLAZIN'!! You can see the love between all involved. This shows what a blues performance is all about.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't wait till the next one, being able to see the prior ones with the prime membership  was well worth it!!
B003E8P9G0|4.0|This is a action-packed book full of magic and  heroics, ( totally my style )  plus  there's a cat goddess, and I LOVE cats, so bonus point there, AND there is totally  rebellious sister who is awesome. I love this book and this series and would suggest it to anyone who likes the Harry Potter or Percy Jackson and the Olympians series.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|omg I cant believe its here and its free I love it the only thing I would change is like I would want more places to go while ur running but besides that it is awesome I love temple run 2 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0805066691|5.0|The history of the great American masacre written from the Native American point of view.  This book made me cry at the injustice dealt out to a stone age people.  If this atrosity were committed today, the USA would be the first in line to defeat the autocratic government killing it's own people.  &#34;Manifest Destiny&#34; was wrong and the USA has yet to admit it's crimes against humanity or to make apology or amends or to honor it's treaty obligations.
0738711500|5.0|This book is a great step by step guide for people who are new to Tarot and wish to learn the ancient science. The card deck is beautifully designed and it speaks by it self which makes it easier to remember. I do regret that it doesnt have some history of how its use developed but over all is a great book for beginners.
0553579908|5.0|These books run the line between fantasy and old world reality. An interesting mix of both set in a unique world created by the author. The chapter are from different points of view. This means that you jump around from character to character, all experiencing something different. Sometimes you have to look back a few chapters to keep track of a particular characters adventures. But the books hold you attention.

This means that you jump around from character to character, all experiencing something different. Sometimes you have to look back a few chapters to keep track of a particular characters adventures. But the books hold you attention.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|its soooooo fun!!!!!! a huge stepup from temple run 1!!!!!! the only bad thing is that everynow and then its a little pixel-ish looking but other that that its awesome!!!

B004XZR63M|5.0|Excellent. I'm telling all my friends. A whole new way of understanding money. Well written and easy to get concepts.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|It was an interesting movie. Colorful scenery. Interesting plot but reminiscent of others I have seen like this. Not sure why this was receiving such top movie review scores but maybe the second movie will be better.
0525478817|4.0|I really enjoyed reading A Fault In Our Stars first and foremost because John Green is hilarious. The witty banter and thoughts of the characters alone are worth reading. Green is an intelligent writer and his words flow consistently throughout the novel.<br /><br />Green does more than tell a great story-he asks a lot of questions about life, death, God and the universe and doesn't give answers-just more questions. As a question-asker in life, I appreciated the questions and I appreciate that they didn't have answers because then it would have been a cliche cancer book.<br /><br />I love symbolism, so I appreciate all the symbolism Green uses.<br /><br />I like the main characters, Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace. They are intelligent teens, much more mature for their age probably because they've faced challenges most of their peers never have to even think about.<br /><br />The ending was perfect-some call it a twist, but I saw it coming pretty early on. What I liked about the ending is that it ends hopeful, life lessons are learned, and the wording is great.<br /><br />Grab some tissues, though, because it will make you cry.<br /><br />I have very few complaints about this book, but there are a few. I like Hazel and Augustus, but they have very few flaws and I love flawed characters because it makes them more human. Hazel and Augustus seemed to me the quintessential awesome-beautiful-smart teens whose only issue is was that they are dying. Granted, that is a big issue. But, their near perfection made it hard for me to relate to them.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|Nice looking, durable cover. It holds the Kindle in landscape mode without any slipping. The black elastic band is great for hooking a stylist to and holding the cover close. The only thing bad about this is the port to charge the Kindle is at the back of the cover and the manufacturer didn't think to put a hole there so you could charge the kindle while its in the closed cover. Don't understand how someone could overlook such an important factor.
B005721W9O|5.0|If you're a star trek fan, you shouldn't miss this one.  Yes, it's a spoof of Star Trek - predictable polt lines, campy acting, petty squabbles among the 'talent,'  But it ignores the spoof just enough to make it a great stand alone sci fi film.  And the comedy and acting are good enough that it'll be enjoyed by those who know nothing about Star Trek or TrekCon or the like...
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have never enjoyed watching a series as much as Downton Abbey.  I cannot wait to see the next episode!
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Long, drawn out, nonsensical story. The silliness of the ending is difficult to make this book worth reading. The plot is just utterly ridiculous. Not every book needs a tick ending to make it a good read and this one wouls have been better off as a straight spy novel.
1416583432|3.0|The premise of this book is great...that in order to understand our dogs we should try to see things from their point of view, imagining what it must be like to sense the world in their, not our, manner. The execution of that premise, though, just didn't seem to work.<br /><br />The actual scientific information presented felt fairly scanty--and too often interrupted by little tales about the author's own dog, Pump. I could have done without those. Rather than adding to the content, they took away from it, without accomplishing what they were probably intended to: inject personal narrative that reaches out to the reader.<br />Thinking about it, whereas I should have come away from this book with a wealth of knowledge about dog-think, it simply didn't happen.<br /><br />Although I read very quickly, this little book seemed to take forever to finish. it didn't keep my interst, and the language, while graceful, was slightly soporific (no reading this one up late at night!)and had a tone that seemed just a little inexact for what you would expect from even a soft science book.<br /><br />Bottom line: OK, not wonderful.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Where does she get her wonderful plots? I can't wait for her next novel. I am a devout fan. Love the characters and plot.
B0086449YA|5.0|I have all of his music.  I have this CD set in my car player right now and just keep switching between the two CD's.  My favorites are the Red Bud Tree and Privateering.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I am anxiously awaiting the next installment in this series.  All the talk about 50 Shades and I thought this series was better written and more creative. I will have to go back to the beginning and reread the whole series when the next book comes out and I'm honestly looking forward to revisiting these characters.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you are into this series, the number one ranked show on all of cable television, and you miss some episodes, this is the way to catch up.  No commercials, and since you own the episodes, you can watch anytime on any compatible device.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Works great and is a big help.  Especially if you are using your Kindle a lot as I do.  I recommend it
B004LROUNG|3.0|Easy reading,but the ending was anticipated.  Not the usual twist that I&#34;m used to with Grisham&#34;s books. A very easy read.

B008XG1X18|5.0|oh what wonderful information, recipes, tips and ideas!<br />Recently have turned my sister into the &#34;pinning queen&#34;<br />learning something new everyday!
030746363X|4.0|I bought this book well over 6 months ago.  I read a certain portion and just wasn't committed to trying any of the suggestions.  My doctor had recommended I do the low carb diet as outlined in this book.  We'll I've started doing the low carb diet, only have been doing it for 5 days, it's surprising how adding the legumes/beans have improved the feeling of being full making the diet easy to stick to.  So far I have lost 5lbs and an inch off my waist.  I have yet to do the bingeing day.  I'm going to give it a shot for one month.  The only reason I'm giving the book a 4 stars is I just barely started trying some of the suggestions listed but so far I'm impressed.  It's not just a diet book so it's entertaining to read on a lot of levels.
161382212X|3.0|I guess I got what I paid for because it wasn't expensive. Type in the book was sort of blah and it was a smaller book than I thought. Pretty skinny. But still, in good shape, and most important part is what's IN the book, which I enjoyed. I wouldn't spend to much for it, but it's a nice read.
B006Y9BVRM|5.0|After buying and returning several other similar Citizen watches, I purchased this and love it. It has the look I want, it comfortable to wear all day, and the strap is excellent. If Citizen put this strap on their Skyhawk, I would buy that, but their stupid clasp ruins that watch.
B006903GX8|5.0|What is there to say say about this book,I love it. It is about my fav.show. Full of facts and pics.Amazing.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Great story and great acting. Clint Eastwood is a national treasure and let's hope he makes many, many more movies!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|i have seen this book everywhere and read all the hype about it,so I thought I would give it a try. It was awesome.
B0056A9WF8|5.0|Far, far better than the film. I was gripped and enthralled by this chilling tale from a master 1970's horror storyteller.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I mean who doesn't love this game? It's a great game to play when you are bored. Easy to play.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun for kids and adults of all ages.I can't stop playing once I start. There is always something I can be doing with my new horse beauty. Try it, it is very additive.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Loved it. I have always wondered what was the hype around this show. Now I know. This show is amazing.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Great now I need a stopwatch for my homework!!! Lol keep upgrading and I think it will be great just stop the adds!
B002BWP49C|5.0|Purchased this product for my daughter as she did not have this particular movie and we needed to add to her Twilight Collection
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app because I love horses. it is so fun to play with; compete; feed and groom your own little horse. I play it a lot!!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Purchased as a gift as my niece did not have it this particular movie.  Of course she loved it. (:
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book I really enjoyed. Can't wait for \\"House of Hades\\" that comes out in October 2014.Super Excited can't wait
B00309DC1M|5.0|Love the Disney movies and needed to purchase this to add to my collection.  I would recommend to all (:
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Inspiring, I truly loved this book. I think their love was real and one of a kind. This book was beautifully written and definitely worth the cost and time to read it
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|Easy to use and fast no bug so far(2wks), it does exactly what it suppose to do and exceeded my expectation<br />Used on Acer iconia100 and android 4
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app is so  convenient for me to use on my Kindle Fire. It works just as well as the one on my laptop.
B008NB0SQO|4.0|Love this movie! beautiful blue ray quality! Very happy to finally have it on disc! I was very sad to find that they didn't even have this great song on the extra features! It's a travesty that they stripped this wonderful movie of a song that is much needed in the story to show a softer side of Scrooge.  Anyway, still recommend this film as a great Christmas movie to share with the whole family.
1401937268|1.0|The Major Arcana are the only cards that have angels and those are the Archangels. Out of the Major Arcana you'd think Doreen could find different levels of angels for different cards. A suggestion off the top of my head would be - the Thrones for Justice card. Instead there are duplicate archangels doing double duty in the Major Arcana and quite a few other angels I've never heard of even being Archangels.<br /><br />The cards come with 3 word sayings for you at the bottom of the card. It reminds me of a fortune cookie.<br /><br />Onto the minor arcana - no angels. Well, one group out of the 4 suits has wings but I think their fairies not angels. There's Earth. Fire. Air. You get the drift.<br /><br />Please, don't buy this deck unless you just like the art. Midlevel to serious tarot workers won't find anything to work with in this deck. Its not a tarot deck. Its a - positive affirmation - deck.<br /><br />So misnamed. Such a shame. The Star tarot card is the one on the box and the one shown. Don't be fooled. Some of the names of the Archangels are not known to me and I've got the Encyclopedia of Angels that I've bought from Amazon. The Star is not an archangel. Nice picture. Not an archangel. Also - Metatron used twice? Really? I know that Michael was used twice but Metatron too?<br /><br />ART. If you view this deck as ART and only ART with daily affirmations - great. PLEASE don't view it as a tarot deck.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|Has many creepier elements than the prior movies; would not show this one to my young children, but great for adults! This is by far my favorite of all the Harry Potters. The cinematography is epic in the action scenes, and it's full of humor. Shipped quickly as always..I am never disappointed in Amazon and movies.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent production value.  Top notch cast.  Witty, Engaging.  Downton Abbey is a most entertaining series that one looks forward to every week!
B003JBI2KM|5.0|This book is great from start to finish.  Excellent resource as a consolidated, quick read.  I read the book cover to cover, knew what I was looking for when I went to the LHBS, came home and brewed a wonderful tasting beer.<br /><br />Yes, other reviewers may poke fun at Charlie's sayings, but it was down to earth, understandable, and built concepts as it went.<br /><br />However, home brewing tools on the market for very reasonable prices are superior to some of the techniques in this book (auto siphon racking cane, for example).  My advice would be use this book as an introduction, not as a bible.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|This app is a great way to condense news and social media into one format.  The Facebook and Twitter capabilites are probably the best way I've seen to look at those tools on a smart phone.  The ability to log in from both my kindle and android make this a definite front page icon.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|amazing fun intertaning ILOVE THIS GAME it keeps my mind at work and intertaining game a tad bit hard than the last one but fun
B008X9Z4I8|3.0|This soft neoprene zip up case will hold the Kindle Fire 7\\" HD and other devices of the same or slightly smaller dimensions... it's really just a soft travel case/cover sleeve to protect the Kindle, not a case to hold it while you are using it. In my opinion it would be desirable to have a case that functions both ways - as a zipping protective cover and as a stand/holder for when you are using it. I haven't seen something like that so far, so for the moment I've gotten both this sleeve cover and a case designed to hold the device while it's in use. This cover is fine for what it is designed for, though for such a simple, soft purse-like case I'd like to see it being sold at a lower price. So if this is the type of cover you need then it's a decent option if you find it at a desirable price and are happy with the color options (there are currently 3 different color options available).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a good game<br />1. There is a mystery-box that is free in the game which allows<br />you to get different characters and some cash in the game.<br />2. If you are looking for a game like temple run  this game has<br />a lot more upgrades.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />R.Chapman
B0076DELIG|4.0|I enjoyed the first three quarterss of the book and the author's clever way of reconstructing the past by contacting both witnesses from decades earlier as well as current figures from the newpaper with whom she worked.  The final pages of confrontation with the murderers were standard: weak link in the chain leading to the powerful leader.
B00992CF6W|5.0|they really need to start updating this game faster and gamemodes like creative or basic its glitche but all this can be patch soon fun game my sister cant stop playing it!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I found the naivete of all those characters who accepted the explanation that the &#34;Racketeer's&#34; explaination that he was making a movie as he traveled from place to place was completely absurd.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|My daughters and I really enjoyed this dvd.  It arrived in a timely manner as expected.  It was in good condition, but after watching it the first time it now doesn't work right.  It pauses and skips.
0316187216|3.0|I love Joe's work,  I've read the First Law series, the heroes and a dish served cold and enjoyed it all. I painted pictures of his characters and settings,  but this one lacks the charm and ferocity of Joe's other works.  If I were a grade school teacher I'd give him a strong C+.
B005LAII3A|5.0|Was a great movie and would recommend others to watch it.  We have passed it around in our family.  It arrived promptly as expected and was in great condition.
B009VB97EY|1.0|The movie started out funny, but just never got better. Not worth renting.  The ending was just plain bad.  Channing Tatum was funny and his dancing and stripping was hilarious.
B005LAII8A|5.0|This was not exactly what I expected from the previews, but I liked it anyway.  We have been passing this one around the family.
1439153663|5.0|The book is absolutely amazing. I could not put it down, I just had to find out what happened to these characters.  Yes, the subject matter is incredibly difficult to read about but it is so compelling.  I'm shocked this is the author's first attempt!  Highly recommend this book to everyone!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a must have if you like the first one..  If you love Temple Run you will love Temple Run 2..
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I just love this movie! I would recomend it to all my friends and by the way I already have!
B009YBTZ8O|1.0|Forgive me for this but I haven't even bought the book yet. Reason i am &#34;Reviewing&#34; is to say i Want to buy it but am not because i have been put off by the fact that it seems riddled with typos To me that's just not acceptable. I will not pay so much for a book that wasn't even edited properly. It<br />seems to be THE biggest problem with Kindle books.<br />Have Someone Check and fix your book before u push it on Kindle!!!!! This goes for all authors.
1475143389|4.0|First I should say that Michael Matthews has published an excellent guide to how to build the body of your dreams. It is well worth the price if body development is your goal.<br /><br />There is, however, one big dissapointment for me. I work out at home, by myself, with a minimum of equipment. I use a chin up bar, dumb bells, gymnastic rings, and AB slings. In order to follow Michael's program, the major exercises need to be performed in a power rack and a spotter is highly recommended. Going to the gym doesn't fit my life now. I was hoping the exercises in this book could be performed alone at home with a minimum of equipment, but shuch is not the case.<br /><br />Even though I can not follow Michael's plan exactly, I did get a number of \\"pearls of wisdom\\" form the book. The most significant was his guidlines for weight and reps. I have been doing way too many reps of not enough weight. That is something I can address in my home workout. I am excited to see how I progress following Michael's guidlines for higher weight and fewer reps.<br /><br />Michael, it would be great to see a future book address working out at home with minimum equipment. Thank you for sharing your wisdom and experience.
B00005LOUP|5.0|The kids joined me and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  Jim Carrey was great for the part that he graciously played.
B0096HIEE2|5.0|The movie was good,I just didn't like the ending. But it went straight to my Ipad and I really enjoyed it!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very good, easy to use, informative and handy to take with you on n IPAD for reading at any time.
B0083B3KOQ|1.0|I wanted to convert a PDF to a Mobi to read on my Kindle Fire HD. I tried running the conversion twice but I could never open the converted file.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I had this series for some time before I got excited about reading them.  I saw the first book in the theater and I was hooked!
0525951652|5.0|It reached me well before the scheduled date. The packaging was perfect. I have nothing more to say. Good bye
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Brilliantly written.  Two views of plantation life narrate this story, each with unique perspectives on servitude.  I will be looking at more writings by Grissom.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Just touching and wonderful.  I have a yellow lab and this book really touched me.  I thought of my Griffin every page.
B004APVI1G|5.0|This was our FIRST 3D movie and we were not disappointed. The story line was good and we were impressed with the 3D effects.  Glad we bought it and will look at it over and over.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I absolutely love this headset. The mic pretty good, great for Skype or in-game chat. The headset is also very comfortable. The sound is awesome. The battery is 10 hours which is great. And the range is pretty good also. The software is okay. I don't know why there are bad reviews, the headset is very easy to setup.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This has to be one of the worst written books ever.  The characters are extremely annoying and I personally was ready to strangle Christian Grey after the first 50 pages.  The only reason I even finished reading it is because I have never not finished reading a book.  I'm glad a friend loaned me the book and I never paid to read it or I would have been really angry.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Thought provoking, suspense novel. I liked the question/answer writing style used throughout parts of the book. Interesting legal details too, made it read like a true story. Just wish it had answered more questions before ending.
0547884591|5.0|I bought this for my husband and read it cover to cover. It's a great way to learn how to cook and enjoy it. I think the product suggestions are sometimes expensive but it's usually due to the nature of the product. Many are quite reasonable. The survival section is well done, as is the format of the whole book. Can't say I have any complaints!
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I have not had much time to play it yet, not sure how i will like it. I have gotten stuck on playing some of the other games.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Good for anyone who has time to waste. It is as addictive as previous BTD Games, without the ability to completely overpower your towers to all out victory, so you can keep playing for a long time. The multiple tracks, double upgrade paths, missions, and special agents keep the game exciting. Recommended for anyone who has any amount of time to spare, and enjoys tower defense games in general.
B002RI9X8S|4.0|Nothing really needs to be said about this book. It is a classic. This is depression era literature at its finest.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Pageturner and a love story, mixed with a little insanity:-)  I read to 4 AM to finish it. Run and buy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an awesome app! I'm very pleased with the game so far!! I wish there were more things to purchase with game coins but I love playing g it!! It's a fun game to keep the boredom at bay!!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Love Angry Birds and this is the best one! Very fun. Time slips away every time I play. I can't get enough!
B0010358CQ|5.0|If you are into action pack anime, then Appleseed is worth it. My advice will be to buy both movie. Go home, hit the porn corn, have a soda and enjoy. You will not regret it.l
030758836X|5.0|Heard it was a good book. I've never read a suspense/mystery book before. Stayed up till 4 am to finish it in two days. Can't wait for the movie! I love the way the chapters switch back and forth Nick's to Amy's p.o.v. Definitely a must read!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy was an great story. It was very fictional and I may need to re-read, but it is enjoyable and you wont want to put it down.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Finally a good game that lets you figure things out yourself without being impossible. It's. great it lets you play enough to see if you like it before you buy it.
B007SGM084|5.0|This was a very addictive trilogy and I highly recommend this. Very risque, but will keep you intrigued until the very end.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|One thing you have to say about Quentin Tarantin is, his movies have a freshness and spunk that no other filmmaker today possesses.  I can only imagine this is due to the countless old A, B, C and D grade movies this guy has been watching his entire lifetime.<br /><br />In Django Unchained, you can feel Tarantino's love for classic movies and style pouring out of every scene.  It is like he's taken all the movies he has loved from the exploitation, western, and B grade genres from decades gone by, thrown them all up in the air together, and out of this mix has come a movie that feels as fresh as a drop of dew, and fascinating from start to finish.<br /><br />I suppose the first thing that came to mind when watching Django Unchained, is how truly amazing a filmmaker Quentin Tarantino must be if only for one fact (among others) - he has made an almost 3 hour long movie, that to me felt like a 90 minute Friday-night popcorn movie.  How can a filmmaker achieve this?  I can only think of a handful of movies in history, that are upwards of 3+ hours long that completely absorbed me from the first minute, and I could count those films on one hand (think movies of the stature of The Godfather for example.)  An enormously difficult feat to achieve, yet in Django Unchained, Tarantino strings together one fascinating set-piece scene after the other, totally absorbing the viewer in his 'world', for almost 3 hours.  I never looked at my watch or took my eyes away from the screen for a second during this movie.  This fact alone, evidences a filmmaker at the absolute peak of his craft.  I can't think of many (if any) other filmmakers out there today that could achieve such a difficult feat with the effortlessness that Tarantino displays in Django Unchained.<br /><br />I won't bore the reader with the description of the plot - there is plenty of info/press out there.  Needless to say, not residing in the USA, I don't have any personal feelings or bias on the subject of slavery thatI'm sure many other writers here from the USA (and other countries) do.  Accordingly, I was able to simply look at this movie on its merits, without personally being impacted by the potentially offensive or political ramifications of the message Tarantino is attempting to convey here - positive, and negative.  What I will say is that the film has a quality that makes me 'feel' like I was part of this time in history - I was living the experience with the cast on the screen, as the hours flew by.  Jamie Foxx was excellent as the star of the film, but of course he doesn't have as much 'meat' in his role as the other two major players.  It is Leonardo DiCaprio and Christopher Waltz that steal the show here.  They are both such powerful actors and I was truly absorbed by their depictions of two men with opposing ideals on the subject of slavery.<br /><br />I think Tarantino's films have been (mostly) hits and only minor misses in his career.  I'd personally put Django Unchained in my top 3 or 4 Tarantino films, behind only Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterds, and perhaps the first volume of Kill Bill, which I also found exceptionally clever, entertaining and 'fresh' - such a different movie-going experience from the millions of other mass-produced movies brought out of Hollywood every other day.<br /><br />Nothing more I can say.  It is a 3 hour long movie that simply sails by !  As noted above I couldn't believe by the end of it I'd been sitting in the theatre for over 3 hours (including the previews).  A fascinating film from start to finish.  I have a feeling it won't win the Best Picture gong this year but, I've seen many of the other nominees and, Django Unchained deserves to go 'close' in my opinion.  I just don't think Academy Voters vote for a movie like this.  A film tackling without restraint, the subject of slavery with violence smattered all through it?  Not a chance.  A shame though.  It'd be great if a movie like this that takes such risks and walks the tightrope was duly rewarded for it.  Irrespective of this, 'Django' is a great way to spend an evening at the movies.  Just see it !!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So good!!!! It's so addicting and fun.it's interesting and keeps you busy.I highly recommend it!!! The game upgrades every few days and it's about like temple run the upgrades take a while to get its all worth it in the end! Get this app!!
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|More than anything I truly enjoyed the chase scene with the Chevelle SS with the Hurst shifter. the car is from an era long gone and the sound of the motor was like a symphony of music to my ears!  I will own the dvd just so I can view and listen to it over and over.  The rest of the movie was of course entertaining.  And that is all any movie should be.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Not the perfect book (hello, we need an editor here!!) but enough like for the main characters and story tension to hold my interest until the very end. No, the story isn't perfectly fleshed out and the POV/tense is an odd choice that is at times distracting. But all in all, an easy read on vacation that left me more satisfied than most self-published Kindle books. At least this one had an ending. ;-)
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I don't know how I haven't heard about this book until now, but I absolutely loved it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading reguarless of what genre you normally read.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Passed over the CD and the Blu-Ray (got to get a blu-ray player) for the concert.  That was almost like being there.  What a great band!!
B005LAIHYU|4.0|This is historically a total fictional account of Abraham Lincolns life. However as a horror/action movie it was fun to watch.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book takes you to a whole new level of love for someone. This is intense but well worth it just because of the love two people can have for one another. Thank you
B000PEX1IE|5.0|Love Ghost Busters!!!!! Been watching this movie for years. Having a Vizio TV allows me to watch my favorite movies from a click of a button on my remote. Im a very content Amazon customer
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Along with the first book, this is an awsome book. The story starts to open your eyes about two people who have fallen in love with their own issues. Love the story line. Its not mommy porn you have to look past that and just read.......
B000JIHP88|1.0|I ordered one mobile and it had a defective motor.  I then returned it and ordered a second one of the same thing and the second one was worse than the first<br /><br />I always like Fisher Price.  I understand this one has been replaced by something similar so they must have had a lot of the same problems.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun app<br /><br />Hi hi hi sup this app is funny should get it and rate it so u get free gems
B0035K8G2Q|5.0|As a faithful, but objective viewer of this program, I found the referenced episode to be both a change of pace and a risky endeavour.  Even now, in 2013 this episode stands out in my mind with its excellence, showcasing of the regulars' talents and the excellent writing.  I have recommended this specific episode to many and purchased it myself.<br />Bones: S512 The Proof In the Pudding goes where few dare and perhaps into the realm of what really happened to JFK or is it someone else.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I love to journal and use some for that, I like to make lists so use it for that also.  Another use is for family information.  Easy to use.
B0043X1FL8|5.0|I had to watch this for a graduate independent study for my music therapy degree.  I'm glad she had me watch this.  How amazing those people came back like they did. It gives a person hope.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I started and stopped twice..at first I didn't like the teenage characters and couldn't connect. But my need to finish a book took over and I'm glad it did. The storyline was sad, funny, suspenseful and sweet all in one. Great book!
B009738XXM|5.0|It is fun when you find an album that you can just get up and dance around to.  Have had so much fun with this song.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I order this smaller version of the big ones I have to use with my Weber Jumbo Joe, and my Weber \\"Go Anywhere\\" grill. It holds enough charcoal to get my little guys nice and hot. I also like the fact that I can use it when I'm looking to just light four or five coals at a time for my larger grills...
B004GGM444|5.0|It says it all.  I have had this album for awhile now, and cannot stop playing it.  Everyone has something new and inviting to get you up off your feet.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Don't let the price fool you, this is a full blown adventure with lots of hard science, humor, and suspense. Although a little &#34;McGyver-ish&#34; at times, this was one I could not put down until the exciting ending. Sci Fi fans, this is a must read.  Update: I just saw the movie. Not only is this the best sci fi book in years, but the movie is one of the best sci fi movies of all time. Bravo, Mr. Weir. Bravo!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I liked this book but it was boring for most of it until the end. The last 2 books of this series have been this way. I do hope the next is much better.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is app is really great and really challenging better than the first one the visually is great and it doesn't lag or freezee up like the first one definatlly would recommend it
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My five year old loves this game. It teaches her to think ahead and problem solve using what's available. Plus I like playing it too!
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie, Drive, it was very entertainimg...The DVD was delivered very quickly & in good condition.  I think this company has excellent customer service and I am very pleased with tne purchase.  Thanks a lot!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|the angry bird series is a big hit in my house. I think we have about 5 or 6 versions between all our devices. I recommend the space edition too!
B0031R5K8G|4.0|I read an interview with the author where he said that this book was mainly about how badly we communicate with each other.  Certainly, this story written from the viewpoint of a boy with Asperger's makes you think about how differently minds work and the barriers this makes for communication.
B005HSL626|4.0|Decent for a free game. Good way to waste time if all you are looking to do is be entertained for a few minutes
1878424114|4.0|Deepak is great.  i would really recommend this book since it was good and plus inexpensive.  It took me only 2 hours to read this book but it is worth the money.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Of all the versions I have on our various tablets, phones, etc, I like this one the most. Cool new version of the original
B000VNMMR0|4.0|It kept me on the edge of my seat. I was wondering how it would compare with the first one - my favorite. It compared very well.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I have this app on my smart phone too. I like that I can see multiple locations at once and see extended forecasts in multiple formats
1878424319|5.0|Book was in excellent condition and something I will keep and reread for a long time.<br />Great way to live.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like that the levels seem to be different every time I play. I would get this game on my other devices too if its available
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Jetpack Joyride is a fun and addicting game. While keeping you enertained for hours to come having a amazingly funny trailer. This game should cost much more then Free. 5/5
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My kids ask to [play this all the time. We have about 6 versions of the bird games and they like them all. I think the space version is the best though
B004UXUUDA|5.0|i am very happy with my purchase of the movie sarahs key..i havent had a chance to watch it yet but will soon
B007IXWL2C|3.0|this one was just not as interesting as the first two. I didn't get into it as much and it took me longer to read it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I have enjoyed playing the many different games and challenges.  I would reccomend this game to anyone who likes to play games.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|Okay, a research team goes to a far distant planet to find the answer to a mystery that has been plaguing human-kind for millennia. But they find far more than answers..they find curiosity may be the ruin of all life in the galaxy...I rented this movie without knowing that Ridley Scott wrote it and that it was basically a prequel to the Aliens series...wow...standing alone it was a great movie, but as I started recognizing ties to one of my all time favorites, it really began to pop! I watched it twice in a row, watching for all the details I missed the first time...fantastic. one of the best movies of 2012. For the younger crowd that didn't know about the connection between the earlier Alien movies, it would be really cool to rent them all and watch the Aliens 1 2 3 and four, THEN watch Prometheus. it would all come together for you. Scott has a very long and narrow vision and its taken years to tie it all together.
B007PJLUG2|1.0|i can't see the movie and they charch me for it that is not good i been a good client.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an amazing app and the characters and power ups are awesome and look artistic this app is definitely worth ten stars
B00992CF6W|5.0|I will start by saying I love this game. The only issue I have ever found with this game is the disappearing sand/gravel others have reported and the fact that this update is not currently available for the kindle fire hd (I know how to update apps, so that's not the problem).  Since something may have glitched, I'm still giving 5/5 stars, but please send the update out for the kindle fire hd. Thank you very much.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Fantastic. Plot-twist of the century. Needs to be a movie. I loved it more than I love pizza and that says a lot.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Recommended to me, I found it to be an engrossing read though not a pleasant topic.  It may help put some recent events in perspective.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book kept me turning the pages! I thought the story was funny and romantic. I laughed out loud a few times! I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys romance and has a sense of humor! This is the first book I read by this author and I look forward to reading more by her.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I found this app was just what I wanted. Gives forecast for weeks in advance, hour buyout forecasts, great radar maps and pertinent news videos. I love the lifestyle forecast! Let's me know if allergies will be an issue or if mosquitoes are a threat! Saw a review that said it would keep running on the Kindle and was concerned, but if you select the options icon on your Kindle menu at the bottom, you can exit entirely. It's not a problem.
B008745B32|5.0|This is a compelling novel with deep meaning.  The author draws you in and then surprises you throughout the story.  The book is strongly Catholic at its root.  In addition the language is beautiful.  I consider this a must read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game for all ages. Great graphics fun prizes. I would recommend this game to anyone!<br />I wish there were more games like this.
B00AEFZ6V4|5.0|Fantasy is hard to find in the movies -- for every \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" there's only a handful of bad sword'n'sorcery tales for kids (\\"Eragon,\\" \\"The Seeker\\"). As for fairy tales, forget it.<br /><br />But one little fairy tale HAS made its way into theatres -- an enchanting little story loosely based on a Neil Gaiman novel. And \\"Stardust's\\" charm is its lack of pretension, and its willingness to be silly, romantic, fantastical, sparkling and most importantly, tongue-in-cheek. And it has pirates too.<br /><br />A wall separates our world from the world of magic -- and one night, Dunstan Thorn went over it, and had a brief tryst with a beautiful princess, who is imprisoned by a witch. Nine months later, baby Tristan is left on his doorstep.<br /><br />Nineteen years later, a dying king magically flings a ruby into the sky, and says that the prince who finds it will be the new king. The two remaining princes -- and the ghosts of their dead brothers -- et off to find it. But that ruby dislodged a star, and it plummets to the ground across the Wall -- attracting the attention of three ancient witches, who use the hearts of stars to restore their spent youth.<br /><br />Still with me?<br /><br />Tristan (Charlie Cox) also sees the star, and the snotty girl he adores (Sienna Miller) says that she will marry him if he gets her the star before her birthday. Tristan does manage to find and entrap the beautiful star, Yvaine (Claire Danes), and they start off on a magical adventure of air pirates, unicorns, evil witches, and true love.<br /><br />\\"Stardust\\" has pretty much all the requirements for a fantasy and/or fairy tale movie -- magic, love, an evil villain, and lots of odd characters to round out the cast, and flesh out the story. Not much is actually new. But like the original Gaiman tale, the movie winks affectionately at you as the story unfolds.<br /><br />In fact, the movie only really stumbles when it stops to ruminate on true love and how precious it is, etc. Cute, but boring -- especially since the romantic leanings of the leads are pretty clear. Director Matthew Vaughn really shines when he's focusing on airships, goat-men, and the occasional magical sword-fight with an dead man.<br /><br />Despite the scattered nature of the plot, Vaughn directs with a smooth, sure hand, and he sprinkles plenty of comic relief through it -- Captain Shakespeare dancing in drag, or the Greek chorus of murdered princes. And the dialogue avoids fantastical pomposity by being just as tongue-in-cheek (\\"Nothing says \\"romance\\" like a kidnapped injured woman!\\")<br /><br />Cox makes an excellent wide-eyed, slightly blinkered country boy, who turns from a bumbling suitor to a strong young hero. Danes isn't quite as ethereal as one would expect Yvain to be, but she gives a solid performance, and Miller is perfect as the snotty, shallow Victoria.<br /><br />But while the younger performers are solid, the veterans are absolutely brilliant. Pfeiffer is hilarious, chilling and pouty as the constantly frustrated witch, and De Niro steals the show as a cuddly, twinkly-eyed gay pirate who pretends to be brutal. And Peter O'Toole and David Kelly have brief but brilliant appearances.<br /><br />\\"Stardust\\" is exactly what the title suggests -- sparkling, funny, wry, and just deep enough to be entertaining. A solid, sweet little fantasy movie.but boring -- especially since the romantic leanings of the leads are pretty clear.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|clearly the most sad, and seemed shorter than previous seasons....waiting for season 4. hope it doesn't take as long to get started!
B008MAI0WK|5.0|There is enough information available on the internet to guide you through installing and administering your Raspberry Pi computer, but this book collects all of the essential pieces into one place. Although by no means essential, it will make your life easier by making many of the searches for that &#34;just one thing more&#34; that you need un-necessary. I am glad that I bought my copy, and having seen it, I would surely get one if I did not have it already.
1616550414|5.0|The art is phenomenal and the information is mind blowing. No matter how long you've been a dedicated fan there is something new to learn. It's awesome to finally see how the timeline came together and split apart. As far as changing your outlook goes... That's up to how you take the information. It's just hard to believe that parts of the timeline took such a dark turn... I'm leaving it at that to prevent any spoilers.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like this one. Graphics are outstanding! A bit hard to get the bonuses and jump timing right at times. Overall a good game if you enjoy Temple Run or Brave version.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I had gotten away from reading Stephen King because he took a turn in his writing that I wasnt interested in. But this book put me back on track. One thing about SK's writing is that you really get to know the charactors, their everyday life is even interesting. I highly recommend this book for those like me who missed the good works of one of their favorite writers. Stephen King at his best.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|So old world i enjojed this series To me it had every thing in itMy mum also enjoyed this series yhankyou.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Temple Run 2 has improved a lot than the original! It's a great app that I love an I am hooked to it! The only thing I would change is the graphics and quicker actions. Amazing game!
B003R0MF1W|5.0|Ihave not finished watching this series as of yet .<br />So far i am enjoying this show love all the actors in this series thankyou.
B009G78EE2|5.0|His lyricism is phenomenal and his message might come off as a little confusing sometimes, but he's preaching the right stuff. Materialism isn't as important as we make it out to be. Also, there is a God combo of party music and chill.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I like this game.  It's fast and there are different game options to keep it interesting.  I like it more than Bejeweled 2.
B008JF8O9M|2.0|Tried it, but couldn't get it to work with my Epson Workforce 520.  Found an Epson one that works great.

B0074VTHKM|5.0|Excellent , a great story line although it got a little boring at a fee points it was still wonderful the action was good and John delivers like in all his book. This  is highly recommended please
1451695195|1.0|Way too scientific, although I know Dr. was a neurosurgeon.  Too wordy.<br />Never mentioned God or higher power.<br />Not recommended to anyone after reading it.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Just as good as the first. Plot is entertaining and keeps you engrossed for hours easily even though it's a long book. I highly recommend it
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I am up  in age, but really enjoy this one,  Its a little fast , I just keep trying.  Dont play many, but this is a good one,
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is an awesome app...i would recommend it.  Download it from Amazon, its fantastic.  You can tilt it from side to side and everything.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|There were a couple of technical plot holes that no one except someone from the inside would notice, but all in all, a GREAT read. Fast paced and fun. I'll read more by this author for sure.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I started reading this series over Christmas break and haven't stopped. Bought this on my Kindle and have devoured it, amazing story!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I got this app for my Kindle Fire.  The buttons are nice and big and easy to see.  It runs fast and accurate.  Very easy to use.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I cried!! What an amazing series. I wish there was more to look forward to. Very great way to end it tho.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Pushed the wrong STAR.  We love this movie.  Had to get it.  Have been enjoying.  The DVD came unscratched and in perfect condition.  Can't wait to see the next movie coming out with the same actors.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run was fun but Temple Run 2 has changed my life. From the giant monkeys to the railroad this game took the best parts of Temple Run and some new ideas to create an aside experience.
B000002J0B|5.0|love led zeplin the songs speak for them self that era of classic rock is in a class by its self
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a great game but there is room for improvement like maybe if the added levels and a storyline to it not just a dude running and dodging things. But that's just me I like games with a story line to them. Overall very fun game!!
B0079R8KO0|2.0|It doesn't work as pictured and there is a strange cardboard inner lining to the stand. When you bend cardboard it doesn't really have the elasticity to bounce back or maintain it's original shape. Overall, the product does the trick but is certainly a cheaper model of something better.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great romantic story ladies you will love it!  This was such a good quick read and a good ending  Loved it!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|fun time passer but you need to have patience to ac omplish things. nonlinear battles are always happening and forget online ... no one semester to play that zmide
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a quick read and a very engaging book I would recommend this novel to anyone who likes a page turner!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Very good show, I would recommend it to anyone.  Season 1 was amazing, season 2 was slow, season 3 has been just as good as season 1, and depending on the episode was sometimes better.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I work from home and when I'm not at home I'm in an airport or a hotel. Since I'm always on the phone or the computer I have several BT ear buds. But I found I was always leaving the PT Voyager Legend at home. The fact that it did not come with any sort of case meant I wasn't able to stuff it into an outside pocket of my carry on and not worry about damage. The manufacturers decision to not provide a case I'm sure was a calculated marketing decision to drive user purchases of this accessory. All of my others came with some case, even the $45 one. But the features and performance of this product overshadow my disappointment in the manufacturer. And this case is just the cherry on top. It solves any complaints of a short proprietary charging cable and provides very adequate protection. My Voyager Legend will now be a constant traveling companion. The additional talk time provided by the case battery means I could actually take a three day trip and probably never need a wall outlet. Matched with all of the other feature/function/benefits of the headset itself, this is just the last item that makes this the cadillac of blue tooth headsets.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|Outstanding Italian,Spanish French,English renditions of great personal favorites. Andrea Bocelli has a deep rich midrange tenor voice that brings out the music comfortably, not pushed, but well executed. Good for me and the wife.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Great ergonomics, great sheath, the blade came hair shaving sharp from tip to choil, it's very thick but does not feel heavy because of the balance and the high flat grind. Even with it's thickness it can make fine thin slices and can be used for food prep unlike the OVERRATED and OVERPRICED Becker BK2 that has a way to thick grind and bad blade geometry.<br /> The SCHF9 has a great handle that can be used all the way to the lanyard hole to make minimal fatigue chopping cuts, also it's so well balanced that it can be used as a short length machete, it would also serve the purpose of a tactical blade and would be great for a Soldier or anyone whom like me practices blade martial arts (Kali/Silat), the point is plenty good for piercing and the balance goes perfect with kali flows. One strike from this blade with its perfect recurve belly is going to take bones with it. Griffin designed this blade very well.
B008CLI4N4|1.0|I did not buy the series from Amazon but borrowed from a friend. After getting stoked about watching a sword-wielding fantasy set in a medieval kingdom with varying races of people, I turned it off after 25 minutes. The scenery is great; the costumes are great too. The computer animated intro with the map and mechanical castles is kickass. The show, however, seemed hollow.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT! This is not so much fantasy as it is male fantasy. Call me old-fashioned but when a group of giggling and naked whores who all look like college hotties are running to service a midget, it makes me think I'm not the target audience.<br /><br />In the few minutes I saw of the show, over a dozen people were dead, mostly by decapitation, and one horrific viewing of a dead child. Such a graphic beginning makes me think that violence and sex are used as ways to mask the lack of character development or story. (This is not a comment on the book which I've read some years ago and thought was good.)<br /><br />I'm tired of Hollywood pushing the envelope. If vulgarity and perversion are the best HBO has to offer, I'm glad I don't have HBO.<br /><br />And PLEASE scrutinize reviewers and the homogenized dates of their many reviews. Nuff said.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I always love horse n this is the game that will not stress me out instead it helps me kill times.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to see the movie and see how its all depicted on film. Please read the first book, without it you miss a lot.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Really different, Saw the previews and my wife and I thought it would be a fun movie to watch. We were not dissappointed. We both would recommend it. A good clean movie for a change.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the Story. Suck it Prez Snow.<br />The ending Was different then I was hoping for, but ends it nicely.
B0085W09ME|4.0|A very complete price comparison guide and easy to use. But why isn't SW Airlines in here, and which others are left out of the data base?
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Not usually a big fan of jigsaw puzzle apps but this one is different.  It is unique and relaxing. I love unwinding with this game. So glad I downloaded it.
B007712XAU|5.0|A friend talked us into watching Downton Abbey, so I decided we should start with the first two seasons.  We're hooked!!  We are now all caught up to &#34;real time.&#34;
0307454568|5.0|Of the three books, this was the best one, but you must read the first two, to get the full benefit of this book.  FIrst book was hard to get into at first, but moved fast paced, then second one was even better, and the third one, I couldn't put down! I hope they make sequel movies to the first one.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|this is a terrible offering from demille if that in fact is who actually wrote it. i gave up less than half way through. it was mostly background filler, stilted dialogue, cliche sub plots and zero suspense. the publisher and author (alleged) shouldbe ashamed. i would expect sales of the next demille will go way down as a result. they certainly deserve to. what a waste !!! certainly do not recommend anyone buy this.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love having this on when I am going to bed, man does it help me sleep. The best thing about it is that, the sounds are realistic. My favorite one is the 'Thunder Storm'. A buy that is worth it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My friend told me about this game and I didn't think I would like it. After I started playing it, I haven't been able to out my Kindle Fire down. The picture is really bright and clear, and I love how the course changes every time. Love Love Love.
B000SEI230|5.0|A very touching story about  how people should treat one another. Life can be to short so we need to make the most of the time we have.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I am a 33 year-old soldier about to deploy to Afghanistan, and I've been reading this series since it was the lightning thief.  I read the all three of these books in this series in two weeks in between training and on my down time.  It's an excellent series that is fun for everyone young or old.  I can't wait for the fourth book to come out.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|great game....would recommend it to everyone...good for the kids as well as adults. if you are looking for a fun game try this one!

0385536828|2.0|Based on his more recent works (post-Atonement) I think either McEwan has passed his prime, or isn't trying hard enough.  Much of the story is trite, and none of it is profound.  I was disappointed.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a great game! I am just as addicted to this one as I was the first. This one is a bit more challenging, but I like the challenge, great graphics, new settings, and new abilities.<br /><br />However, I only give TR 2 4 outta 5 stars because Ive had trouble with the game glitching and lagging in the middle of a run. Because of this my device doesnt react to various obstacles as efficent as it should. Also, sometimes when I use a &quot;save me&quot; it exits out of the game, losing my progress.<br /><br />Other than those minor problems (and i would assume easy fixes), i love the game and would recommend it to anyone who loves a challenge and adventure!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Really good game for wasting lots of time.  Love all the unlocks as you rank up.  Could have better battles but still very fun.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was an awesome love story!  I couldn't put this book down.  Another classic by Nicholas Sparks!  And it was also at a great price!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My daughter loves this game and it seems quite cute.  There seems to be allot you can do and interact with.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|This is the cutest app ever and it teaches all basics of cooking!<br />My 2 and a half year old loves it.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Help me this is another one my husband is addicted to and loves to play all the time.  My kids love to play it as well when they get a chance to get it away from their Dad.
B001AXKXBW|3.0|I remember when this album came out. I hated it. It was as though Dream Theater made a list of all the most annoying aspects of their music and crammed them all into one album. As a result of this album, I stopped listening to Dream Theater entirely, and didn't look back for 12 years.<br /><br />A short time ago, I decided to revisit the album. I listened to it several times, from start to finish, and found that it wasn't half as bad as I remember its being. Some of it was actually listenable. It's nowhere near the level of the band's earlier material, but there are still bright spots, and overall it is well worth listening to.<br /><br />The band's &#34;influences&#34; (read: source material) are on full display here. That, and the emphasis on riffs and solos (as opposed to the emphasis on songwriting and mood emblematic of their earlier albums) make SFAM a bit more appropriate for a younger, less mature audience. This has been true of the band throughout the Rudess years, and this album is consistent with that fact. But there is enough solid material to make it an album worth owning.<br /><br />If you're new to the band, I recommend you start with the &#34;Awake&#34; album instead. If you're an existing Dream Theater fan, then it doesn't matter what I think. ;)
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|help me my husband is addicted ha ha.  It is a fun and addicting game. fun for the whole family.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I am not a fan of Nicholas Sparks, I got turned off the depressing surprise endings his books usually have when I was a teenager. A Walk to Remember is still one of my least favorite movies EVER because of that. The trailers for the movie piqued my interest however because I love Cobie Smulders and I decided that I wanted to try to find out the end of the book by reading a lot of reviews looking for spoilers. Instead I kept reading reviews which said that Safe Haven was a much darker book than he usually writes and was more like a thriller, two of my favorite things, as well at that it was a departure from his other books so I decided to buy it.<br /><br />I read it from start to finish in ten hours and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I didn't even mind that it started off slow because it was great character building and well written, but that's all I'm really going to say. If you're looking for a spoiler you're not going to find it here. Take it from me, it's defintiely worth it to just buy it. I may even drag my husband to see the movie now :-D
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun game. many things to so its not repeatative. have a little trouble getting it to load sometimes on my kindle, but I don't have much memory space left.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I originally played world of goo on the wii console but when amazon marketplace had it for the free app of the day I definetely had to scoop it up. The play style is original and some of the puzzles are fairly hard.
159413586X|5.0|This series is, imho, the best written of ANY (including Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, et.al.) YA series yet. As a writer myself, I am awed by Collins's skill in setting up and achieving such painstaking planning of all three books. This third--concluding--novel was every bit as edge-of-the-seat as the first two.<br />Collins drops us into the story, and without any seeming effort, we learn everything we need to know about Katniss: What kind of person she is; What her goals are; What she'll do to protect her family; and What is the world she's living in. All before we start on Chapter 2. So masterfully done and so compelling to read over and over--not only for the unique story (and I'm so glad I read all three novels before seeing the first movie) but, especially for me, in trying to learn just HOW Collins does it.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a very fun game for all ages. it has great graphics and sound effects. who cant love being chased by monkeys
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book so much that I couldn't put it down for one second.  I can't wait to start the next one!
B00936A0RU|5.0|Saw this in the theaters Andy thought it was great. Was surprised when it didn't get good reviews. I bought to watch with my husband and he liked it too.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My 5 year old grandson loves it. Loves how it is a little different than the one on my Kindle.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Story kept me on the edge. Loved it from start to finish.  Every character brings their own unique personality that makes it  great read.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Not too hard. FUN  without having to concentrate too hard  sometimes you just want to play without a lot of pressure.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome. i had it for the pc but it just caused my computer to basically kill itself, and i couldnt play it anymore. that is, until this! although, it should have the 0.6.0 update available but it is not. ill try tomorrow. ..
B003JTHXOK|5.0|EZ reading.  SPECIAL Love story.  A real thriller.  Can't wait to see the movie.  Hope the director makes it come alive on the big screen.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|You cannot slide to turn on my son's nabi. There's no problem with any other games on his tablet. I've tried reloading the game and it won't even reload now.
B006I1OB0U|1.0|I ordered Downton Abbey seasons 1&2 Limited Edition Set and the Christmas Special is already on that. So buying the Christmas Special was a complete waste of money. I don't know why it was being pushed - like it wasn't on season 2. Very disappointing to have spent that extra money for no reason. I'll think twice before ordering anything else.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I first read this book when I was younger (around 7th grade) and just finished it again at 28.  The first time was captivating but a little beyond my comprehension, this time I absorbed everything and really felt every raw emotion London fed my imagination. Timeless and epic.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Great entertainment and good quality bluray. I love Downton Abbey and I hope the show continues for years to come.
B005H29GSI|5.0|I bought this game for my three year old nephew for a Christmas gift. He LOVES the angry birds franchise, he has everything from angry birds pajamas to having a angry birds themed birthday. Little did I know however, he has been asking my sister for this specific game for months now... He opened it, and it was like the world around him ended and all that existed was his new game. He may be a little young for the concept of the game, but he's a bright enough kid I'm sure with his parent's help, he will learn how to play it.<br />K...<br />Specifics of the game:<br />As others have mentioned, the pig's faces are just stickers. Not a dealbreaker, but something to know going in.<br />The launcher has to be held down with one hand (this seems obvious, but you never know...)<br />Game looks fun, I never played it, but it looks like it could be fun for lots of ages, or even just fun as a angry birds playset.
B009G3TNIM|5.0|This album has more variety, branching out more than the previous album. It sounds like the future of hardcore to me.

0061864153|5.0|This was a perfect gift for my wife who is a huge Bon Jovi fan and the pictures are very nice.
B0031RS58I|2.0|I read this author because of her madcap characters and over the top embarrassing situations they find themselves in or often cause themselves.  None if this was evident in this book. It was quite dull. It was also annoying how no one could get it into their heads that she had amnesia and couldn't, not wouldn't, remember the last three years of her life
B0098VYKSA|5.0|Really got into this movie, Definatly give it 5 stars and two thumbs up. & looks really good in high def
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's the best game ever to play. If you get bored or sad one day you should really play this game.
B004X4R49Y|4.0|I love Colin Firth so I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Also the picture quality of the amazon instant video was not bad.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|love it!!!!!!!!!  when I am at the doctor's office or hospital it make the wait more enjoyable and relaxing... thanks!
1451678193|3.0|I read Fahrenheit 451 a few months ago and loved it! It was such an easy book to get sucked into. The concept was 100% original, and it was even fairly believable - albeit a little frightening to really dwell on. When I started The Martian Chronicles, I was expecting something similar - and initially, it's exactly what I got...initially...<br /><br />I really liked the beginning. Though quite fantastical (bahh I'm embarrassed - I read over that word at least 10 times and wasn't sure if I made it up or not!), it was actually pretty believable. There was this feeling of unease that permeated through each story, which upped the enjoyable factor quite significantly! Now cue, oh I don't know...100 pages later, and what went wrong? I can't even really pin-point it - I just sort of lost interest. We may have on our hands another case of too many disparate stories not tying into each other. I'm always a sucker for character development, and when each character is featured for max 10 pages, you tend to lose that a little bit.<br /><br />I think you could have guessed I would say this - if you've got the Bradbury itch, go for Fahrenheit 451. Been there, done that? Give The Martian Chronicles a try - it's pretty short, and you might enjoy it more than I did.
B0071BY1ZQ|4.0|i didn't quite know the trio, the suggestion came from a friend. What touches me the most is to hear the panist and the basist sweep the notes instead of banging them. I imagine how soft it would be to hear Brad's music on a record instead of a cd. It would be like having acces to the sound of the waves of the sea licking the sand of the beach.
0316044695|5.0|Being from Long Island this book hits home it's an amazing story about the men that serve our country in this seal team very addicting
B007T99ENE|3.0|Actually this was a very average read from Ian McEwan. Some clever writer tricks with books within the main book and then a twist at the end- but the characters were just too unappealing. It felt like McEwan did this in his sleep and threw in a few tricks to keep the punters happy.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Contrary to popular belief this is not a BBC production. It is produced by an American production company for an independent TV production company in Great Britain. That shouldn't take away from the show's appeal. It is highly addictive however. It'll be interesting to see if the loss of characters will affect the reception of the plot line in season 4.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is the best of all of the books I got ever. The best of all.<br />This is a great book.<br /><br />  P.s does anyone play minecraft?
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I liked it bit was violent (but not overly graphic/bloody) and there wasn’t really anything inspiring or edifying about it. There was good character development, good plot and story line and a good strong finish that brought closure but left it open too.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This can  is out standing.  High quality and great settings.  The Sean was set outstandingly.  This is my favorite game I have on my kindle fire hd.  I also have it on my iPod.  This is beast!
0765325950|1.0|Like everyone else i've been waiting for this book a long time. I haven't read a book on paper for years. To try and force readers to buy a hard-cover, or go without for months, is so far beyond stupid there isn't a word to describe it. Protest vote lodged.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This book has been well thought out and is an amazing story. I can't wait to read the next one! The storyline pulls you from the very beginning and doesn't let you go until the very end. Jonas was a very relatable character and was my favorite. There are points in the book where I thought should be rewritten or is unnecessary. Great Job Lois Lowry! This will be a book that is enjoyed for many years to come.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|This book was more fantasy than fiction.  I had a hard time believing the story or finding Reacher remotely like able.  He's supposed to be larger than life, but really....
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It was a great book! I enjoyed it very much!  11/23 /63 was outstanding and worth reading hope you enjoy as Much as I did ,JFK slain Dallas LBJ takes oath Stephed King 11/22/63
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  Loved the characters and just overall enjoyed the story.  I envision reading this book again sometime in the near future.  I do think this book has the potential to get lots of hype then some people read it and don't understand why, so I'm glad I don't fall in the category. This was my first John Green book to read and I must read more from him.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I think it was really awesome. I loved it, and I would tell everyone else about it.<br /><br />It's so awesome
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my daughter has been playing this game nonstop for the past week. she is only six but it has kept her very entertained.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I didn't want to put this book down.  It's a true account of what happened to a young girl and how she's doing now.  A lot of parts are very, very sad, but it helps you understand all that she went through, and how she got through it.  What a courageous woman!!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This is a real example of perseverance and the will to live. Our hero never gives up, no matter what! The part that boggles my mind is that he is alone on Mars for Years! Story drags on a bit and seems like one is never going to get to the climax. Mc Giver hasn't a patch on the martian!<br /><br />Good reading for the patient Sci-Fi reader!
B009E3EY38|5.0|I recommend absolutely Celebration Day, It is an amazing material but I think that Immigrant Song should be played in that concert.
B001THZAAI|4.0|It's a sweet movie, I would say to see it, but don't think it is extra funny.  It is funny and sweet.

B000N0W9WO|5.0|Great Movie, great for watching if you need a pick me up. Especially in the winter time when things are dreary.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|I love the feeling of adventure that this book brings to the reader. The sense of discovery, the descriptions of the city, and the vivid character development made this story a pleasure to become immersed in.  If you love Europe and books about relationships, then you will love this book!
B006VREHRS|5.0|We spent Christmas vacation tucked under blankets streaming video through Amazon to through our Roku to our big screen television. We purchased this series and it was a bargain! The plot twists and historical aspects of the show along with incredible set decoration and costume design make this another HBO winning series.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Really good!!!!! Was exactly what i ordered. The movies work great and look great. The sound is awesome. I highly recommend this!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green got these characters just right. I was hooked in two pages. Loved the recurring line about side effects. Perfect!<br /><br />I worked with children with cancer for eighteen years. I found the teenagers to be full of hope, but with an irreverent sense of humor and a realistic understanding of the possibilities for their futures. Many wanted to experience love just one time, and some did. They seemed wise beyond their years, having had to grow up quickly to face death head-on. I wasn't surprised by the ending-it was completely real in my experience.
B000XUBF3I|5.0|This is an amazing but very practical read.  It is almost a how to, but so much more!  I love that it it is encouraging and frees me from perfectionism!  It is hard to explain how a resource which emphasizes letting go of perfectionism especially when it comes to our home and families brings reveals more peace and a cleaner home!  I never knew I was a perfectionist until I had a few head on collisions with &#34; the clutter&#34; in my house!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn has a brilliant mind. This book is complex and original. I was surprised at every turn. If you have an issue about a writing device used in part one, keep reading, because the problem you are having is resolved in part two.<br /><br />Flynn always amazes me with her descriptions, finding ways to characterize people, places, and events that the average person would never, ever think of. She is a master with words.<br /><br />My only criticism of this book is that I felt the ending went on too long. Seems like it could have ended after the major plot line was resolved-with some unresolved issues to be sure, but still finished. I didn't feel the wrap up of the two main characters was needed.
B005LAJ17M|4.0|Blu-ray loads  slowly and hard to bypass opening introbut quality is good. Regular DVD may be a better option unless Blu-ray is needed.
B0000CABBW|1.0|This ponderous, vapid, and truly boring film violates almost all the rules that good films seem to follow. Its glowing reviews prove that the \\"Emperor's Clothes Syndrome\\" is alive and well.<br /><br />There is virtually no tension, few surprises, no excitement, and boring characters from start to finish. From the beginning I knew what would happen to Pai. All the wonder was taken away by this film's nearly immediate predictability. It isn't even that interesting visually.<br /><br />I didn't cry. I didn't laugh. I was not moved one bit. I was relieved that it was over.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is perfect no other running game is better I would play this all day if I had could
B005LAIHSG|1.0|I'd rather eat the apple than see even one minute of this silly, silly, silly movie again.<br /><br />This was recommended to me by another adult and I thought, \\"Why not? Perhaps it's a clever adaptation of the fairy tale.\\" HAHAHAHAHA I will be honest and say I stopped the movie when Snow White was escaping from the tower.<br /><br />The beginning scene is lovely. The snow falling. The rose. The queen pricking her finger. That's the high point. How much stupid computer-generated animation, how much melting objects with deep voices, how many stupid battle scenes are the American public going to keep swallowing before they've had enough and stop going to see drivel like this?<br /><br />Give me the cartoon any day.<br /><br />PS Charlize has exceeded her limit of angry women roles. She's nice to look at but her range is glaringly apparent.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really love this app. you can di so much more than in the first one in this one there is cart tunnel that is really fun. You should soo get this game it is the best thing sconce hey created angry birds.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is awesome to play when your bored get this game/<br /> it's free you get yourself up and be cool
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|Heartthrob is a concept album.  The pre-order on their site came with a teenybopper magazine, complete with pull out posters and quizzes and facts about T&S.  They've done a series of videos leading up to the release of the album talking about what it means to be a heartthrob and reminiscing about heartthrobs past.  It's called Heartthrob, and it lives up to the images and feelings that that word should arouse in you.  It's poppy, it has dance beats, it's about love and longing and losing yourself in those things.  These themes are inherently what Tegan and Sara are about, they're just dressed up a bit differently on this album.<br /><br />Heartthrob is good.  It's really good.  It's a different sound than previous offerings from the duo, but their musical style has been in a constant state of evolution since the beginning.  I'm a longtime fan of T&S, over 10 years.  I've never been disappointed by one of their offerings and this is no different.
1616614609|3.0|It's an ok game, with interesting mechanics, but it's two-player only, and a rehash of an old CCG.  It's still sound, but some streamlining of things could've helped.
B000FCKGPC|1.0|The story could be just as good without all the filler. Too many begat who begat who begat. Who can remember it all?  This book is not as good as the other three. I will not even start book 5. I too believe GRRM is bored with this long long epic and cant come up ending except ,maybe letting the Others kill off everyone that's left. (I love my Kindle Fire)
B000LTAY1U|4.0|The watch is awesome overall. I bought this because it was a good deal and because it was automatic. The watch works great and  seems to be put together nicely. I do think that Seiko could've done a better job with the band, the band looks cheap, and a little on the narrow side. Besides that, it is a great watch.
B00701897I|5.0|Very good quality on all formats.  I bought especially for very good quality on blu-ray and 3D and sound quality.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|This third season is just as good as the first and second. Full of suspense. If you like thrillers this is one you'll enjoy.
0307346617|5.0|I love this book! I've re read this one several times. Not that it's groundbreaking or anything, it's just a fast, fun read if your into the zombie genre. I hate to say Hollywood is planning to destroy it, please read before going to see the movie.

158270208X|5.0|I bought one of these for my BFF b/c of her love of the book and movie. She ended up bragging on it SOOO much that I decided to get one for myself. I am really glad I did. The book is attractive (from an owners of dozens of journals since I was 9) and super sturdy. Happy I decided to get one for myself as well.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Loved it so much I ordered season 2,3 &4.  Revs your engine if you like macho men that are bad ass but also show you that they have honor and family values.  Nice to look at too :)

0425252868|5.0|Every now and then I cross paths with a book that strikes a chord somewhere deep within me, a book that shares my waking hours and my sleep.  This is one of those books, as was Laura Hillenbrand's Unbroken.  Coincidentally, both tell a true story from World War II ... Unbroken tells of Louis Zamperini who survived to tell about his adventures as a US pilot in the Pacific, subsequent capture and imprisonment by the Japanese.\\" A Higher Call: An Incredible True Story of Combat and Chivalry in the War-Torn Skies of World War II\\"  tells of two pilots, one German and one American who meet high in the skies over Germany on December 20th, 1943.  Both of these books will stay with me, I am sure, for a lifetime.  A Higher Call grabbed me and simply won't let go.    December 20, 1943, in the skies over Bremen,  Germany.  Charlie Brown is the pilot of a B17 bomber, just finishing a raid on an aircraft production facility.  His plane has been hit multiple times by German flak. It was missing a rudder and had sustained serious damage to its hydraulic and electrical systems, not to mention that only one engine out of four was functioning at peak, one crew member was dead and several others seriously injured, and now Charlie faces flying through enemy flak to get north of Germany over the North Sea and back to Great Britain, a feat beyond all imaginings.  Suddenly from behind he spots a German fighter plane and Charlie knows he and his crew have no chance to survive if the fighter shoots so much as a rock launched from a slingshot at their plane.  This edge-of-the-seat action enhances, but does not dominate the story.  The pilot in the German Bf109 is Franz Stigler, a man who joined the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) to avenge his brother's death.  One look at the B17 and Stigler knew it didn't stand a chance.  He remembered the words of his former leader and mentor, Gustav Roedel, who had once told Franz, \\"you score victories, not kills ... you shoot at a machine not a man\\", and decided in less time than it took the thought to form that he not only couldn't shoot down that crippled bomber but that he would do everything he could to save the men inside.  There were two dangers to this, but Stigler barely registered them.  The first, of course, was that the bomber would fire on him first and knock him out of the sky (he didn't know that the bomber's guns were frozen, all but the turret gun whose range was so limited that he was never really in any danger from that).  But the other, perhaps greater danger was that if the German command ever found out that he had the chance to dispatch this bomber and didn't, he could be court-martialed and sentenced to death.  On Stigler's mind at that moment in time, however, was how he could keep the crew on this bomber from either being sent to a fiery death by German flak or an icy death in the North Sea.  Ultimately, he led them through the German flak and left them over the North Sea with a salute and a prayer that they could stay safe.  And it is in this one episode that Franz Stigler became a hero in my book.  He would go on to fight some 487 missions in the war and is now in history books as a German flying ace, but for me it was that one act of human kindness, of human compassion, that made him a hero.    Though the book centers around the heroic acts of Charlie Brown and Franz Stigler in the air over Germany that day, the event itself actually occupies less than 4% (15 pages out of 368) of the book.  Had I realized this in the beginning, I might never have bought the book and that would have been my loss.  The bulk of the book follows Stigler's career and rise as a flying ace throughout the war and it is from this that I, who have nursed a hatred of all things pertaining to the German military almost since my birth, came to realize that not every soldier in Germany was a Nazi and not every soldier in Germany lacked a heart.  The Luftwaffe, or German Air Force, in this book is shown to be no less humanthan any man in the USAF or any other branch of the Allied military.  Overwhelmingly, the Luftwaffe were NOT members of the Nazi Party and did NOT support Hitler and his programs.  They were simply there to do their jobs and defend their nation and its people.  In fact, most were not aware of Hitler's \\"Final Solution\\" (the extermination of Jews) and the death camps until near the end of the war.  For the most part Germans, including the Luftwaffe, were as afraid of the SS (Gestapo) as were we.    Many years after the end of the war, both Brown and Stigler wondered what had become of one another.  Neither knew the other's name, yet neither had forgotten that strange encounter in the skies over Germany.  Eventually they would have their reunion and become brothers not of shared blood, but of shared life.  Notably, though fifty years had passed since the end of WWII, once this story became public, Franz Stigler began receiving hate mail, presumably from Germans who felt that he should have blown Charlie and his crew out of the sky.  I guess hatred is in no danger of becoming extinct any time soon.    This is Adam Makos' first published book, though he has been editor of the military magazine Valor, for some fifteen years, and frankly I was intrigued when I read a synopsis of the storyline, but was not expecting great writing from this first-time author.  I was wrong.  The writing is as seamless and spell-binding as almost any I have read.  This is a heart-warming, yet edge-of-the-seat true story that reads like a novel and leaves the reader wanting much more.  Sadly, both Charlie Brown and Franz Stigler died in 2008.  However there are photos and video clips of their reunion some 50 years later on the author's website:  [...].  If you read no other non-fiction book this year, do yourself a favor and read this one.  It will stay in your mind and in your heart for a good long time, maybe forever.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless immediately became one of my all time favorites! It is an amazing &#34;must read&#34; for everyone. Colleen Hoover is beyond incredible!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was one of those books that I would rather read than watch tv.  So good!  I can't wait to see who plays Gray in the movie.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|James Dashner you've done it again!!!!!!!<br />You have taken this book and made me even more excited to keep reading the series. Please don't stop and keep me in suspense in the Death Cure. I can already tell its going to be good.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Honestly, so freakin' good!  I loved all three of these books.  Every string in my body was plucked.  I laughed, I cried, I was angry and happy but must of all...I was turned on!!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Winter of the world .book 2, by Ken Follett. Love this book another Follett hit.Keeps the reader spell bound.Worth reading.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|When I choose a book over television, the book must be good.  This was one of those books.  Watch out!! There's a shocking twist!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season three is amazing and wonderful.  I cannot wait for season four and find myself wishing to speed up time to next year just so I can find out what happens.  This is a great show!!!
B008YCMM2A|5.0|What a gift for the diehard Miles fan and and for posterity. This material has previously been available only as over priced boots of varying quality or rapidshare downloads. Both the Antibes performances and the Berlin video document  a significant turning point in music history, with Miles pivoting from his old repertoire and the controlled freedom of the quartet with Wayne, Herbie and Ron into new territory. And this is merely a couple years after Karlsruhe in 1967. Live in Europe 1969 captures this moment of transition and it's positively prophetic  The landscape hasn't been mapped out yet; there are no rules and very few structures or signposts. In A Silent Way has been out for a few months. The release of Bitches Brew is in the near future. Standards like \\"I fall in love too easily\\" are simply vehicles to be deconstructed, a launching pad for new textures, tempos, and rhythms...ultimately to be completely transcended and discarded. This is history unfolding before your ears. Miles reinventing his music yet again. Imagine being in Berlin for this concert. How many in the audience came to hear one thing and left having born witness to something else entirely. Something coming together on the bandstand right in front of their eyes.Something new, something fresh. Even 40 years later, its still miles ahead. Most importantly of all buy this because music of the lost quintet is finally reaching the wider public audience it deserves with an authorized release, something that has been long overdue.<br /><br />Note to the Estate: Could the packaging be improved? Unquestionably, yes. In the age of the mp3 file, the box set should be somewhere between a work of art and a fetish object.<br /><br />But in the end, it's all about the music.<br /><br />Remembering this particular band in his autobiography Miles said, \\"It was a bad MF\\"<br /><br />It was all that and more.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|I feel like the first paranormal activity thru the third where ok movies but i feel like each time they could have pushed harder to make it scarier. The ideas and opportunity are there but the seem to fall short sometimes on the scare factor. They need to make it more believable and not so hollywood. they need to understand people get scared when you show them something that could happen in their everyday life. If they do come out with a fifth to the series i hope that they will redeem themselves. One last thing i felt that the time in between scares was too long.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is just the greatest!  Wish it never had to end.  I look forward to the next episode with great anticipation!
B006TF6WAM|4.0|I guess we all get the feeling it might be the time in life to take a break and go walkabout. If this has happened to you. Then this is a great and amusing read. Harold becomes more and more likable and you start to live every step with him.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|This is a very good movie I can not say enough about it. I have even let my friends barrow it.
B005OHSD3A|5.0|this book has all the information you need to do this way of eating. it has helped me a lot.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My 7 yr. old grandson really enjoys the challenge of Temple Run 2. It is a little more difficult than Temple Run.
0192853619|5.0|I've enjoyed reading it. It seems to me that Timothy as a broad view and a deep insight in the matter and beyond as well. Though as a matter of fact by any way I'm far from being qualified to set down such a statement, I'm sure Timothy to kindly overlook this. Send my regards to Timothy.<br />If by any chance Timothy would come accross this review (which I doubt because he then might be stuck all day long reading his amazon reviews). Tell him that I did try twenty years ago the abstract/axiomatic method which he advocates for a bunch of adult students who found great difficulty with mathematics to say the least. I wouldn't say this experience turned into a catastrophe but nearly so and I had to back off at the time. This method doesn't seem to be a straightforward answer whatsoever, maybe because if you can't grasp a stuff because you get the feeling it has no immediate concrete vizualization, then you may not be enticed by a game which is pure abstraction either.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We have now watched both Season 1 and 2 on instant video and are watching Season 3 on PBS.  This program has become a part of our lives, with us looking forward to each new episode.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|All I had going into this series was one person's recommendation, but after reading the books' description I decided to take a gamble and buy this boxed set.  It could've been a big waste of money if it'd turned out that I didn't like the books, but I was quickly sucked in.  This series takes place in Regency England but in this world supernatural beings (vampires, werewolves, and ghosts) have come out-of-the-closet a long time ago.  This was series was the first I've ever read that could be called \\"steampunk\\" because there are some technological advances that didn't actually exist in real-world Regency England.  Alexia is an unlikely heroine.  She's logical, cool under pressure, sarcastic, and she's always trying to a \\"proper\\" lady.  She's taller and darker and more curvy than is popular.  All of these things made me love her as a character.  She gets married to a werewolf in the first book, and the way they interact is constantly amusing through the whole series.  There are a several other characters, including her hat-loving best friend Ivy and flamboyantly homosexual vampire friend Lord Akeladama, who are all very entertaining.  This series was an excellent mix of adventure, comedy, and even a little romance.  I'm sad that it's over with!
B000K29CEI|5.0|My 9 and 11 year old boys really loved this movie.  They spent allowance money to purchase it.  The humor is on par with most of the PG animated films and I get a kick seeing a movie I enjoyed when it first came out in the theater.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The night circus<br />This book was one of the most interesting and spellbinding books I have ever read. The reasoning behind this is the fact that I too was a circus acrobat and contortionist for many years, some of the best of my life. Although this book depicts certain aspects of my years of experience in the circus, the night circus brought it to a level so much different that I got swept up in. The descriptions and detail are incredible along with the creativity of the plot and the way it was written. All in all and exquisite book!
0817439390|5.0|Well written, well illustrated. Step-by-step tutorial on exposure ... a subject I was so intimidated by that I never even tried.  And, when a book has more than one edition, I know others have thought well of it too.
0547260695|5.0|I love this book myself, and I love having a fun version of it to give to younger kids. It's one of my go-to birthday gifts. The pop-up art and interactive aspects of the book are so fun, and it adds so much to the already amazing story.
B001TOD92C|5.0|i really liked this movie. it had the drama i was looking for. i saw this movie before and i new i wanted it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|T.R.2 is a great game I highly recommend this game. Especial people who played T.R.1. If you have not played T.R.1 try it. You might like it better or you might like 2 better than one.You choose... Share Your Opinion<br />... Hope this was help full ... Casey<br />  (P.S. Who doesn't like free)
B009RH9J7W|4.0|It's nice.  It works.  Do I absolutely love it?  Not really, but it's ok.  Can't figure out what I would change to make it a &#34;love it&#34;.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Can not believe the quality for 60 bucks!  To think you are getting a seiko mechanical watch for around 20 dollars or so more than your typical junk watches sold at the big box retailers is amazing.  Mine is accurate to about minus 2 seconds per day.  Can't beat it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the awesome is game ever the person who made this is epic<br />The game is epic because we build its fun build
076790382X|4.0|The rants on the the computer were just tedious and annoying. The rest of the book was fantastic. If it weren't for those two chapters it would have gotten five stars.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I like the different reading plans and the different versions available.  There is a learning curve for how to navigate through it but once you have it it is easy to use.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Simple, tough, easy, hard. All of the above. And fun!<br /><br />It makes you think and makes it fun to do. I can't stop.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|PvZ was the first game I ever played on an Android, and it's my favorite to this day.  It's simple, entertaining, and glitch-free.  I love the wide variety of zombies that you get to shoot at, blow up, burn, freeze, crush, and drown in this game.  Highly recommended!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Ok, so i know i will get a lot of hate, but i have never liked Minecraft. Too much hype, not enough actual fun. Before you claim that i am not getting the full experience, i have played the computer edition at friends house multiple time, and the same complaint rears its ugly head: the fun doesn't last. While the novelty of the game is still in effect, it is an incredibly fun experience. But after 15-30 minutes, the whole experience becomes stale and boring. Both creative and survival suffer from this for different reasons. Overall, it is fun while it lasts, but it really doesn't last. 4/5 in small, 20 minute doses.
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|Fun, fun, fun.  The beginning of this book engages immediately. The middle holds attention. The ending was rather dragged out, but still fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I have been playing this game ever since it came out. The rating I would give it is 1000000. That's how much I love Subway Surfers. I got a lot of other people to start playing this game. Everyone I got to play this game is also in love with Subway Surfers.
B004EWFUQY|4.0|This is easy for me to follow and I enjoy the built in &#34;breaks&#34;.  The lists make it even easier to follow as I can just post them on my fridge.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun and good for kids of all ages im 13 and even like the game pic. Quality is very good and 3d
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game. Tons of free upgrades with coins you earn but you can also buy more coins from the appstore<br />Super game especially for free
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So fun!!! Awesome graphics; I can't stop playing! Probably the best app I've ever played. Even better than the first. LOVE THE MONSTER MONKEY!! : D
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great game especially for someone who loves horses but doesn't have the money or space for the real thing
B00785P2QC|5.0|If think this app is a great way to pass time and awesome and is absolutely amazing. If you think this game looks boring than think again!!!!
B00A6I87UQ|4.0|I have the S & T's Pocket Sky Atlas in paperback. It's my go to atlas for study and for planning my observations. When I discovered that it was on the Kindle, I decided to buy it. It's very similar to the bound edition, in fact, too similar. I use the Kindle App for iPad, so I can zoom into the pages. The pages aren't high-res, so zooming in gives you a blurry image. Very unfortunate.<br />As far as the atlas itself, it's a valuable, very accessible resource. Easy to use, spiral bound with heavy pages so taking out in the field is great. The constellation boundaries are really defined, objects (Messiers, NGCs, ICs) are clearly labeled.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Well maybe not quite, but this was a great read, especially for geeks. Weir tells a good story, keeping both the hard-science geeks, and the mere adventure seekers interested. For those who have ever had contact with the NASA bureaucrats there are lots of jokes and digs about \\"the NASA way.\\"  This story starts out fast and just gets better and better, drawing the reader along. I hope we will see more from Andy Weir!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a great book. It starts off a little slow, but picks up quick and is great to the end. A real page turner.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If your looking for a game that has creativity and you can also slain zombies this is the game you want,I bet that if you get this you will never get bored of it!!! &gt;:D
B002N5N5R0|5.0|Absolutely love this show.  Can't wait until next season.  Viewed the season in two nights liked it so much<br /><br />Have now order the rest of the seasons.  Great without commercials.
0765325950|1.0|I'm incensed that I have to wait 3 months for the ebook to be released.  Stupid, stupid, STUPID decision on the part of the widow and TOR.  The fact I can get the audio version and not the e-book is a slap in the face to all us kindle readers. I ONLY PURCHASE EBOOKS!  CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very entertaining.  I enjoy the fact there is basically no foul language.  Can watch this show with children in the room.
B00656C6KK|5.0|I've always enjoyed listening and watching her films.  Her CD , My Heart, which I purchased is very enjoyable listiening and she still has it.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Tune in was a great app...until the current version which will not install once my fire hd.  Needs further work before it is usable.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|This was a great movie!  Okay so Monsters, Inc. was good but this one was by far the cutest, most adorable \\"monster\\" movie ever.  I usually gravitate towards Rated R blood/gore/scare but for some reason, this peaked my interest and I am thrilled it did.  I LOVED this movie!  It had a cute story, an interesting plot and enough twists and turns to be perfect for adults and kids.  This is a great family movie and everyone will enjoy it.  I'm sure the actors and actresses had a great time making this movie.  I'm not going to summarize the plot or story because so many others already did though I will say this was cute, fun and definitely a keeper.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Jeff kinney has really captured the middle school dance vibe. The stress of finding a date, a friend stealing your date, or seniors taking over the dance. I couldnt stop turning the page. Im only 12 and i still love writing reports on a book. You could call me a Genius...(;. Thanks to my Comm Arts teachers,  Ms. Thomas and Mrs. Harris (:
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I found it impossible to stop watching.  I enjoyed every epidode. The time flew by. Anyone who enjoys a well written suspense series will love this.  The performances by all were award winning.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Grandkids love the movie. having the DVD gives them the flexibility to watch it when ever they feel the desire.  It is a wonderful movie and accurately captures the division of reality between the adult world and a childs innocence.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Nicely written page-turner. Humor + love story + teen angst = winner. Buy it! You won't be sorry you did.
B00821OTJM|3.0|I'm trying really hard to like this show but people are getting on my nervs. Way too much talking about this and that and few actions if any. Too chatty. You'll see and next thing you'll know is you're frustrated. Could've been but nah...
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great game have really enjoyed playing this game on my Kindle. Deliver was just as expected. Thank you I will be more than happy to purchase from this dealer again.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|I had known of these people, even had a friend who catfished. But didn't know a term for it beyond &#34;creepy&#34; nor that some take it that far. It makes you very weary of anyone online.
B0091JQH2Q|5.0|Just as I had spent a lot of time, effort and money to acquire these recordings of the symphonies separately, EMI finally see the light and throw it after us virtually for free! Well I can't complain.. I never succeeded in finding no. 6 on CD. This is currently my favourite set, together with the other EMI reissue, with Barbirolli, and the Karajan 4-7 on DG (supplemented by Kamu's 1-3).<br />Recordings sound excellent, and will satisfy all but the hard core of anti-romantics who'll want this music to sound more terse and \\"analytic\\". Make no mistake, whatever you say, Sibelius was a romantic, actually the last of the great romantic symphonists. Tempi are slow, if you like to compare timings. (For the ultra-romantics, Bernstein's final recordings on DG, of nos 1-2, are even more emotional and slow-moving.)<br />The other works in this set were already released in a different box together with Berglund's Helsinki version of the symphonies, which are faster and less enjoyable in my opinion.
B0090NNQX6|5.0|A very good album by a very undervalued artist. Definitely not mainstream pop. The acustic versions are amazing. Keep going Mika!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love working puzzels. I can make my puzzel easy or more difficult.  I don't have room to set a table up for puzzels .
B001N1DPDE|4.0|This is a great knife,  But the handles are too slipery and you could really cut your hand up good.  Get the micarta handles for it and spend some time sharpening the knife and finish it off on a crockstick.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|Deff A Sick Movie!!! I Think Its the best one out yet. Its A Really good movie from start to end
B009UX2YAC|1.0|just mixing this game rock. But y is the stuff a lot of $.That is what I got to say.  :D
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Highly recommend this game it has great graphics and the gAmes are easy to play. Perfect for horse lovers! I would by more gAmes by this company in a heartbeat
B000IZ1HP4|1.0|I am old enough to have seen this movie on the big screen upon its initial US showing decades ago. It was a crappy movie then and it remains just as crappy now. It is long,drawn out and almost comically bad in every respect. I can see the attraction in wanting to watch an aging Henry Fonda in an active role but that very role was so poorly written that even the immense talent that Mr. Fonda had oouldn't overcome the almost comic book quality of his lines.<br />I was given the DVD as a Christmas gift a couple of years back, watched about half of it and simply could take no more. I gave it to the local public library to let some other poor sap muddle through the seemingly endless and utterly dreadful spaghetti western.<br />Eastwood launched his massive movie career with Leone's spaghetti westerns and most of them were really awful. Eastwood somehow managed to pull a success out of the Italian hat, Fonda.....well, he embarrased himself in my mind in participating in this vehicle.<br />This is one spaghetti western that is so awful that you cannot even view it in a comical light. One is left feeling sorry for the faded career of Mr. Fonda and can only hope that the man got VERY well paid for this embarrassment.<br />Not worth a rental, and just making the movie available for sale should be a crime. 5 million \\"thumbs down\\" for this extremely poor foreign flick
0316077054|5.0|I will write more of a review once I finish the second book.<br /><br />Sad thing is I misfiled them on my bookshelf and read the first chapter of book three cause I thought it was book two. Ergo sadly I have spoiled them ending of book two for myself but still reading it and can't put it down. I love that the underground tunnels mentioned in the first book are given more coverage in this book. I especially love Amma and how she just seems to pop out of nowhere and I am starting to believe that Lucy the cat is like Boo Radley.<br /><br />Okay for me the start was not from page one but from the first time I saw it in the used bookstore. When I opened the book and saw either the family tree or either Ethan talking about his family tree. I was like yep if this is the page I opened it on I will definitely have to give this book a try. It is calling to me. I was thrilled to learn there were more than one book to the series. I got them all a few months ago but never read them cause I have so many books I have yet to read lol. Then I found out back in Dec 2012 there was a movie coming out in Feb 2013 so I figured I would dive into the first book.
B001AQMBKA|5.0|My wife and I got first season for xmas we liked it so much we ordered the rest of them. My only regret is the show only had 6 season.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its a pretty fun game. only thing is a lot of waiting.<br />not good if you dont like waiting. i liked it ok.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|It's perfect, many different water noises like oceans, beaches, rain, thunderstorms, also other types of sounds for people in other parts of the country. I fall asleep to this right away and every time
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Very good sharper, I love it, very good, I highly recommend to u guys who wanna good sharper, very good, choose it.
1449433251|5.0|We bought this as a gift for our uncle because he loves Calvin and Hobbes. He seemed to really enjoy it and the price was just right.
B000N2HBSO|3.0|Don't know when I will finish it because it is lengthy.  It isn't holding my interest as much as I would like it to do.  Very informative about the time and includes very detailed biographical information on this team of rivals.  Haven't gotten to read about the genius of President Lincoln yet.  I know I have to reach much much more to properly critique it.  However, I  saw the movie Lincoln and loved it.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|We have both CDs and I am glad I got this one because it is a good CD. He is so talented!
B007TXN4TK|3.0|I love the Bach beginners practice sheet music.  However,  sometimes it doesn't play the music.  I touch keyboard and cannot hear it for no apparent reason.  Otherwise, I would give it 4-5 stars.  Was thinking of buying the app and hoping it would be a better app.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|fun to play! plus it was free-- spend too much time enjoying it  i would recommend to others-good game for all ages
1451695195|1.0|My headline pretty much says it all. I wasn't planning on buying the book until I saw it was on sale. I'd seen this doctor in so many interviews I thought I had heard all he had to say. But, then I thought those TV interviews are just a couple minutes long. Surely, in a book he would go further. He doesn't and most of the book is spent talking about his family heritage, his adoption family, meningitis and what was going on around his bedside the seven days he was out of it. I guess he pieced that together from what his family told him or just made it up.<br /><br />On top of no content it was so poorly-written I'm surprised he got it published. What he had to say about his experience could have been put into about 10 pages. Repetitive, repetitive, repetitive. And, those ten pages would have had nothing inspiring or new to say.<br /><br />I've read many NDE accounts and definitely believe we have a soul that carries on lifetime to lifetime. I haven't experienced what he allegedly did, but based on what I've read of other more believable accounts I think any of us could have written this book by doing a little research. I'm sure he thinks he had the experience and he probably did, but it wasn't worth writing about.
B00B780TAK|5.0|I absolutely love Downton, but the end of the season finale completely shocked me to the point where I don't know if I will watch next season.  As a writer myself, I understand the need for drama, etc, but this?  Really?  Wow.  Not to take away from the rest of the show, which is one of my favorites of all time, and this season was also superb, but I think there will be some understandable uproar among viewers.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|A quick read, but very good.  I enjoyed it and would read additional books from the same author.  Great price!!!!!!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|The kids loved it they are huge fans of both angry birds and star wars.  We can't wait for the next version.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice big numbers!!! I love this and use it all the time.  One of the best calculators I have used.
1401941893|3.0|Disclaimer: I received this book for free from Hay House for review purposes. The following are my personal and honest opinions.<br /><br />You've seen her pretty smiling face and rocking bikini body in Victoria's Secret catalogs. In \\"Treasure Yourself: Power Thoughts For My Generation\\", Miranda Kerr opens up and shares another side of herself. She talks about how positive thinking has been such a powerful force in her life.<br /><br />Miranda doesn't shy away from hard topics like personal loss. When she was 16, she dealt with the sudden death of her first love and boyfriend of two years. He lost his life in a car crash.<br /><br />This challenge taught her that \\"life is so fragile... [and] we need to really live and appreciate every moment.\\"<br /><br />Miranda had a vision loss scare at the beginning of her modeling career.  A photographer shot very close up photos of her face without keeping the protective cover on the flash. She ended up in the hospital, and found out that her eyes had been badly burned and blistered.<br /><br />At school, a classmate would say mean and hurtful things to Miranda.<br /><br />What I really like about this book is the reminder that every single one of us goes through difficult things - and we can respond to our pain by pouring our energy into doing something positive.<br /><br />Miranda is a strong believer that we have the power to choose how we respond to our life experiences.<br /><br />The first half of the book consists of stories from Miranda's life. The second half is filled with positive affirmations that can be used to energize and inspire yourself. It's an easy, uplifting read!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Perfect for my needs.  Light and compact but protect my Kindle very well. Fits perfectly in my purse so I can take it everywhere.

B007RTAR64|5.0|love the doll got it for my wife. thanks
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book made me sad to think that someone could be so mean just to try to bring happiness to ones self.  There were a lot is surprises in the book that kept you intrigued.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I can't say enough about this book - in fact, I read it twice since I devoured it the first time around (that says a lot because I also cried like a baby after the first reading!)  I thought there was a great balance of humor and somberness - although slightly heavier on the humor side.  There were many amusing moments with Will and Lou that I continued to think about long after reading the book - thanks to JoJo's superb job with character development.  I cannot wait to see Will and Lou come to life on the big screen - I can visualize Zooey Deschanel as Lou and Matthew MacFadyen as Will.  Please read this book!!

B005WGIJNC|5.0|NOTDONDRAPER<br /><br />For anyone who is a fan of the 1989 BATMAN film directed by Tim Burton AND is still into Lego this is the set for you. The Batwing in this set is modeled very closely to the same aircraft seen at the end of the 1989 hit and the Joker helicopter is awesome as well.
B003L77G06|5.0|Great enterntainment and same laughing as season 1. Perfect 20min break episodes. If you like season1, you gotta try this season2.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. Really makes a person think about things. Was quite a story. To hear a doctor tell this means even more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|good graphics good intimidation....enjoy the training the tools the concept all of the cleanup and everything...me and my daughter play she really enjoys it too
B0011Z5IXC|5.0|Excellent music and price.  LZ never sounded so good frankly and for 1.99, this was a super buy.  The download was also fast and easy. Thanks.
B002ZHKZD8|5.0|It was great fun!<br />　　<br />　　There was not one dull moment. The story kept rolling out in front of your eyes while Matt Damon being chased in London, in Madrid, in Morocco, and then back in New York. Cars flying and glass shattering, yet audience managed to keep up with all the little details of Jason when he was chased, why did he buy a cell phone first thing getting off the train at Waterloo station? why did he call the police in a Madrid apartment that he was about to leave? why did he pick up laundry pieces as he was jumping up and down the roof tops in Morocco? why did he set himself up in a seemingly trapped intersection of New York City? All those little questions had an answer within the immediate minute of the scene. Speaking of instant gratification.<br />　　<br />　　The editing was perfect, the music was perfect, the rhythm of the movie was flawless. Paul Greengrass had his audiences exactly where he wanted them to be. And they were never bored, they could never relax, yet they were pampered with humorous moments sprinkled throughout the action packed movie. Even till the last scene.<br />　　<br />　　I couldn't help smiling again and again till the very end. It was like being treated to a feast in a grand restaurant, every detail was well thought out, not one moment of the evening was overlooked. When you left the restaurant, you not only remembered the great food, you also gained so much appreciation on how well a dinner party could be planned and executed.<br />　　<br />　　This is how an entertainment is supposed to be.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Cheryl Strayed documents her pilgrimage on the Pacific Crest Trail.  Her account is both interesting and entertaining.  A good read for those that are considering making this trek.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|The appearance of this trailer has been so frequent, on TV, in movie theatre, that I'm completely desensitized by the time this movie actually came out.<br />　　<br />　　Luckily, there are enough little cute filming techniques and details in the movie that were NOT shown in the trailer to keep me interested.<br />　　<br />　　The acting of both Will Ferrell and Emma Thompson are excellent. Will's Harold Crick, the IRS agent lives in solitude, is so understated, and yet even more funny than his usual over-the-top type of roles. Emma's Kay Eiffel, the crazy and gifted author, is superb that (in Gui's words) \\"you forget it is Emma Thompson the moment you lay eyes on her.\\" She is able to act out all the little quirky ways unique of an author, the things you would never have imagined an author would do for a book, but when you see it acted out by Emma, you'd think, yeah, that rings true. That's exactly how an author would act/thing/imagine/react. Dustin Hoffman did a good job, too. Although obviously pales under comparison, when standing alongside Emma Thompson.<br />　　<br />　　It is a fun little movie. A perfect date movie, with some intelligence, for once. :)

1600597963|5.0|I've done dimensional bead embroidery for several years and know that there is always more to learn. This book is an excellent resource with very clear diagrams and explanations and positively beautiful pieces of work for examples. The book itself is a work of art. For beginners with no experience at all--it would be inspirational but perhaps a bit intimidating. For anyone with some experience, it is a great guide that I expect I will be referring to for years to come.

B007FROH4G|4.0|Compared to the majority of &#34;Alzheimer's books&#34;, taking the perspective of a literate and cogent early-onset sufferer is very effective in getting across the terror that this scourge brings.  It skates a bit too close to schmaltziness for my tastes (I far more strongly recommend Keeper in this genre) but it still moved me and educated me, too.
B002B44KDG|5.0|Neil Young at his best-est. He has a haunting voice and gives a picture of folkloric proportions. I have always been a fan.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|It is a real page-turner, true, but it has a lazy ending, the characters are, to a singleton, unlikable and there's a grubbiness and vulgarity about the whole enterprise.  Doubtless the movie is coming, however, and Ms Flynn will become the next Stephen King.  She says of this book that, &#34;I wanted to explore the geography of intimacy&#34;.  By 'explore' she seems to mean 'write about'.  Explorations imply discoveries and I saw none here.  A good read on a long plane trip, but no more than that.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I love action movies and this one has a lot of action on it, also I love the way the father has experience to know where to go and what to do to find her daughter.
B003VANOFY|4.0|This headset is great.  I own a set of Tritton AX Pro for PS3 and these are equally as good.  The wireless puts them over the top.  Sound quality is great.  I can go downstairs and still hear my friends during games.  The G buttons on the side sometimes don't work with certain programs but that is a programming error not a product deficiency
B005NJU8PA|3.0|I honestly like the learning techniques more than the parts pertaining to cooking anything. I like his writing style and have read all of his books.
B008RXYOKY|1.0|I bought the wrong piece.  I needed the Lightning to 30 pin adaptor.  Apple doesn't notify customers of the changes from one generation to another.

If you have been in an abusive relationship, you will be able to relate and see there is hope and happiness ahead.<br /> This is another Sparks special...he never seems to miss the target of the heart!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Gives a very complex story because of all the characters evolved, but typical Harry Bosch plot.  Cannot be read in one sitting.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|TubeMate allows the downloading of YouTube videos. A choice of video quality is provided for the download or the video can be downloaded as an mp3, although that function has a bug which causes the mp3 to still be recognized as a video. However, the mp3 will play with a music player app. The download speeds are quick over a good WiFi connection. Overall the TubeMate is excellent.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run two is a worthy sequel to it's predecessor. What's good is the new additions like ziplines and minecarts, as well as the life giving emeralds, deadly waterfalls, bigger monkeys, and giant spike wheels. The new setting is in the sky, the forest, or in a cave. The graphics are also much better than Temple Run one. The only downsides are that Temple Run one was very very responsive, and as soon as I swiped I moved, also in the new version there are small turns on the track which the camera follows as you move and it is harder to respond to. The only other issue is how they haven't updated all the characters yet so there are only four. However, these are minor or temporary setbacks and the FREE app still deserves five stars!
B003O86FMW|5.0|You know I've read book 1 and 2. They start off slow, then begins to get faster reading during about 50% of the way through and that's something that I've not seen in a book before I read Hunger Games And Catching Fire. I recommend this book
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|A riveting book I could not put down. Amazing characters and a twist surprise ending. A must read. Wonderful imagery.

B00B0NDF26|5.0|Listening to this album at the grocery store can be a cinematic experience. You suddenly enter a romantic world brilliantly soundtracked by Tegan and Sara. Adding frozen dumplings to the cart becomes a heroic act. Immerse yourself in the sonic aura of \\"I Was A Fool\\", and try not to scare people in line with your crying face. Shop the produce section while enjoying \\"Shock To Your System\\", and struggle to control the impulse to yell, \\"IT WAS A SHOCK TO YOUR SYSTEM!\\"
030788743X|1.0|Anyone over the age of 20 who has read any of the main science fiction novels of the last 30 years (and seen The Matrix movies) will find not one trope or incident in this story that's original. It's all about an Unlikely Hero (read: computer nerd/genius) and video game-playing, and I suspect that those readers who worship this novel (like those who worship Ender's Game) are head-over-heals in love with anything to do with gaming and will thus accept any story that's even remotely familiar to them. I found this novel to be jaw-droppingly unoriginal and am similarly baffled by the number of five star reviews of it. Everything you need to know is already in Snow Crash or the Matrix movies and that about sums up the worth of this novel.
B00B8R5X5G|2.0|As much as I have loved SPN. It should have ended with the conclusion of season 5. Very disappointed. Acting of JA and JP very good throughout.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved the first episode. Shirley MacLaine does an outstanding job and is able to fit in with the rest of the characters very nicely.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved every second of this book. I couldn't take my eyes off of it except for when I had to. So, I am glad that I had all ready purchased the other two because I am currently heartbroken and need to know what happens next.<br />Everybody needs to read this book.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys' music is superb. Even my three children, ages 9-13, enjoy it. It is a perfect blend of classical and pop music, and if you have seen their videos, humor as well.

B004U8ZH8S|5.0|Very entertaining for the entire family.  Animation is amazing.  Story is well done.  And it even teaches a little lesson along the way.  Kids and adults will enjoy it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|angry birds  fun to play but to many pop ups to buy other games very good game for hole family
B002HFJ77S|4.0|Like Sophie's other books, this is a light read but captivating nonetheless. A good beach or travel read. It is a bit more grown up than the Shopholic series.
B005HSL626|4.0|very fun to play good for building hand eye quid. something the hole family can play togetherand have a good time
B00992CF6W|4.0|the reason its not 5 star is because you cant really craft for real or mine Redstone,just make pocket edition just like minecraft for pc just not the all the way online server.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really love this app. I feel like Beauty is my horse that I see everyday at the stables. Finally there is an app that I really enjoy. Thank you.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Caveat: I am a huge Downton fan. Been in from the get-go and am hopelessly in love with the show.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Season 3 (I watched ahead as soon as I could). I won't list any spoilers lest someone hasn't seen it. Did I get frustrated at Lord Grantham? Oh course but I believe I was meant to, given what Matthew is hoping to accomplish for Downton (the Abbey, the town and all of its folk).<br /><br />Did I weep at the loss of a favorite character (that episode has aired at this point)? Absolutely - each time I've watched episode 5.<br /><br />Was I annoyed at the seemingly-never-ending saga of &#34;Bates in Prison&#34;? Definitely, but I am assuming there's an overall point, which Mr. Fellowes is trying to make.<br /><br />In short, it's not perfect, either in character development or plot execution, but there's enough meat on the bones to keep my interest and still have me carrying the overall fan flag into Season 4. I'll be sitting there, in front of my telly, every single night, for as long as the actors and Mr. Fellowes wish me to see.<br /><br />Carson continues to be my favorite character though. The whole comparing the introduction of Mrs. Hughes' electric toaster to Tom Branson's solo-escape from Ireland was just brilliant. He's by far the most hilarious character. Every time he harrumphs in the dining room or counsels Lady Mary is just priceless.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I actually really enjoy the twilight books, and still hate this piece of work, despite the fact that it IS twilight Fan Fiction. Or was.<br />Some of the dialogue is actually taken DIRECTLY from the twilight books. Not to mention another clumsy, shy, silly brunette.<br /><br />First, the sex is one of the main reasons people are into it. That's cool, I can get into some smut. But this is just gross.<br />There is a &#34;sex scene&#34; where he rips out her tampon and has sex with her on her period. Ew.<br />I don't know about you, but I don't typically imagine steamy sex scenes involving anyone touching my tampons.<br /><br />The whole thing is a mess, you eventually get bored with the &#34;sex scenes&#34; and the fact that Christian just won't tell you what the hell is wrong with him, why she can't touch his chest, why his childhood was so terrible and torn, blah blah blah we get it.<br /><br />Also the &#34;down there&#34; &#34;blushing&#34; &#34;holy crow!&#34; &#34;Murmured&#34; &#34;inner goddess&#34; crap gets so repetitive and annoying. I have no idea why this book became so huge but I've read 99 cent romance novels from The Dollar Store that were better.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I think this book has been over-rated.  The book held my interest when I was reading it but it was easy to put down.  Even before it is disclosed it is fairly obvious what occurred.
B00917IQFY|4.0|Graham Parker was one of the original angry young men (with Elvis Costello and Joe Jackson) in the 80's, and his band The Rumour was like his version of The Attractions. Around the album \\"Another Gray Area,\\" he jettisoned the band and began a series of session musicians and another ad hoc group, The Shot,\\" for one album, \\"Steady Nerves,\\" but it was his days with The Rumour that produced many of his finest works. So imagine my surprise when \\"Three Chords Good\\" appeared with The Rumour as the billed backing. Wheil I have been picking up a few of Graham's independent released (and really dug \\"Imaginary Television,\\" I knew I had to grab this one.<br /><br />Timed to go along with Graham's appearance in the movie \\"This Is 40,\\" where he plays himself, \\"Three Chords Good\\" is a satisfying album and seems to have inspired Parker to dig into his lyrics a bit more then usual. \\"Coathangers\\" is a follow-up of sorts to \\"You Can't Be Too Strong\\" and there's an easy reggae lope to the opening \\"Snake Oil Capitol Of The World.\\" What you'll notice is how much Parker has improved as a singer. He no longer is a howler, he strides the song with control as organist Bob Andrews plays the groove with drummer Steve Goulding. Even better, Martin Belmont plays his parts with strength and subtlety through out.<br /><br />Parker was once touted as a \\"New Dylan,\\" and some of the songs here re-merit the comparisons. Both the title song and the snide \\"Last Bookstore In Town\\" pull great couplets worthy of Dylan or perhaps Randy Newman out of their collective hats. Even some of the lesser songs (\\"Stop Crying About The Rain\\" and \\"She Rocks Me\\"; oddly enough back to back in the album's middle) are supple enough to merit repeat listens. Reportedly, Parker recorded the songs live with the band, which explains the easy gait of some of the tracks and the two rockers (\\"A Lie Gets Halfway Around The World\\" the best of the batch) just seem so naturally tasty.<br /><br />Probably a reunion that few expected or where actively rooting to happen, \\"Three Chords Good\\" still makes it worth the wait. Parker should have thought of this years ago. It may be his best work since \\"12 Haunted Episodes,\\" another underrated Parker album from the early 90's.where actively rooting to happen, \\"Three Chords Good\\" still makes it worth the wait.

B00APUYWYA|3.0|I was watching in the car and didn't have proper headphones, so I missed a lot of the clever dialogue. I was enjoyable despite that.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game and and a little better then the 1st one.I enjoyed them both very much.cant wait for the next one; and its free.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I love the music, the scenery, and the story. I even went on the Sound of Music Tour in Austria. It was wonderful!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I don't know if there is a way to not have the &quot;helping&quot; cues when you play this game but it makes it too easy to cheat. Otherwise I really liked this game. Excited for #2 to be released!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|what can I say!!!!excellent game!!!!haven't had this much fun for awhile and don't have to worry about anyone else...so thank for the game
030758836X|2.0|This could have been a good book. I actually picked it up because I heard Reese Witherspoon was involved in producing it in film. The story I liked, but I've never seen such unnecessary vulgarity in language! Raunchy expletives that seem useless and out of place. Even though I am very curious to see how the book ends, I gave up on it last night 1/4 of the way through, enough was enough! I think it shows a true lack of creativity when a writer can't express themselves without cursing.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I found these techniques extremely helpful. I was very pleased with the product and how fast it was shipped to me!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I had to recommend this great magic story to my Jr-high Granddaughter.  Mary & Conn and their secrets make for a great page-turner.

B008673ZAQ|3.0|First book was quicker to ready still working on it it's a better story line than fifty shades of gray
B002MJV75O|5.0|I received the series missing one cd =(, but it's ok, i just imagined that I lost it ;-).  Buy it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Amazing book!! I started reading this book because a friend recomended it to me after reading the 50 shades of grey trilogy...I seem to like this one better since it is not the typical cindrella story...Well worth the time reading them
B008X9Z37A|3.0|it is not great but it works. it protects my kindle. it is not very hard or stable. the top right corner is starting to become a little loose. it is just an ok product
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great Books!! Well worth the time reading!!  Just love these books and the charactors...really hope they make a movie out of these books
B00AREIAI8|4.0|i love his app.  it teaches me how to take care of my own horse. this is great although it does not completely load sometimes and is finicky
B00B2166BS|4.0|Pros:<br />- Sits perfectly in the Pogo dock<br />- Charges quickly<br />- Shipped quickly<br />- Slight depression on the top side of the Pogo end makes it easy to quickly seat the plug correctly<br /><br />Cons:<br />- USB cord could be about 2 or 3 feet longer

B005HSG3VK|5.0|Perfect case for my Kindle Fire.  Keeps everything protected,  Easy to put on.  Have had no complaints, would buy it again.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Just like the devotional it was wonderful to have the entire book downloaded on my tablet immediately.  I look forward to reading this classic.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It took me a day and a half to read it, I couldn't put it down for any longer than twenty minutes.  Sparks did an outstanding job captivating me, as a reader, and making me feel as though I was in Katie's shoes or Alex's shoes.
0062200909|4.0|The book is definitely good enough for the price, it does deliver what I expected. However, quite a few elements of the film are missing and I only have to wonder if they were left out to pad future books in the series. The next one is named confusingly and sounds like there'll be a lot of overlap with this one.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|I wish that \\"The L word\\" would have lasted more than 6 years. The story line was full of surprises. The characters were all interesting.<br />I like how this series was packaged. The bonus material was a nice surprise.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|Very positive reading.  Its already helping me become more successful with my painting and goals.  I will have to read this book a few times during my lifetime so as not to forget these seven laws.
B00AC8ZJPQ|2.0|Very, very boring for an action movie. Seemed like a stupid attempt to rip off full metal jacket in SciFi.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|We grew up with these men as our \\"action heros\\"!  I REALLY enjoyed seeing them all together doing what they do best!  Kicking some booty and saving the day!  Whhhhhhhhhhhoraw!  They STILL have what it takes!  Good work, guys!  Thanks for all the entertainment over the years!  :)
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Bought it as a gift for the girlfriend, and she listens to it daily.  Great CD.  Not quite the original broadway cast, but pretty solid.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Wow from the start I thought it would not be good but wow I was wrong that was one of the best books I've read about mythology I highly recommend this book if you are in to mythology
B009A3NGF4|4.0|One of the few bands being played that I like. Like the alt tracks the best. Listen to folk music live, so your mileage may vary.
B002GJU54E|3.0|I bought this book on special at a local bookstore for $4.00. For the money, it was OK, mildly entertaining and laugh-out-loud funny in a few places. I hadn't read any of the Plum series before so I don't have anything to compare it to. Even though I thought the book was OK, I can see why people would be unhappy if they paid $28 for it. The characters are cartoonish and the story runs out of steam about 2/3 of the way through. It's one of those books you read, enjoy a bit and then completely forget about.
B001B6EAOY|5.0|I wasn't sure if it was what I wanted, but I must say that I am very pleased with my purchase. I recomend this seller.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Having been at the DMZ, I was fascinated and appalled with the reality expressed in this story.<br />I have always believe d that N Korea (a fierce contrast to S Korea-) was the most frightening country on earth. Then,when one escapes, there is still cruelty and hardship for the escapee. Turning his mother in for her escape attempts, the author is brutalized even when obeying his prescribed code of behavior. In the new life, he spend years seeing love among family members and does not know what that means. An easy read if you have the stomach for being a witness to the real world of cruelty  .ClaireJ. Lehr
B00B2V66VS|2.0|i would rate it 5 starts if the bugs were fixed. Every time I exit the game I lose half of my coins. Or I'll be in the middle of a run and it'll crash. I had over 6000m in length and over 3000 coins and when I tried use a save me it crashed and it didnt save anything about that run except for the fact that I used gems.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I had another app that was terrible. I found this one, saw the ratings and decided to give it a try. It is lots of fun for someone who enjoys playing game on pc.
0547884591|2.0|I've read the book and utterly appalled by what he put in the book and the way he markets it. Tim Ferris gamed the hell out of amazon with fake reviews, and the cash just rolled in. He's the warrior forum type of guy who utilized a major hub to push his warez with fake social proof.<br /><br />He is the ultimate proof that you can cheat and get away with it. He produces nothing but fluff.<br /><br />Let nobody say he provides value, because when you read the book and look at the comments, it's just a bunch of people with links to their startup sites, and it all looks like one big pile of stooges doing a dash for cash.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|a lot like Mario...but that's a good thing in my book. :)  my three year old loves playing it, too.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show and now I'm so bummed I have to wait for season 4!  Grrr!  I think they need to increase the episode count..9 just isn't enough!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|That is a really nice game that Iove. If you question this game, take it from me it is a good game!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Bought this as a gift for someone,I assume they liked it because I have heard no complaints.Also brought one for granddaughter
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game and so do the kids I bbysit for&lt;3 I love the graphics and everything in it!! and I'm sooper happy its on the kindle
