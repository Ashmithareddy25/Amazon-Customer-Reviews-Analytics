B0001I561E|5.0|One of the best film Disney ever produced.<br /><br />I can't believe it's been since 1992 already! Even 20 years later, the animations still hold up, and Robin Williams delivers a killer performance as the genie.<br /><br />Last but not least, Lea Salonga is gorgeously magnificient as the singing voice of Jasmine. A Whole New World is one of the most memorable ballad of the 90s for me.<br /><br />5/5 easily deserved.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I love this soundtrack and listen to it almost every day in my car.  The movie was fantastic, and hearing the soundtrack puts me back into the movie with all the great choreography.  Christina is amazing.  And both of Cher's songs are great and powerful, especially &#34;You Haven't Seen the Last of Me.&#34;  Christina's &#34;Bound to You&#34; is beautiful.  If you haven't seen the movie, I highly recommend it!
B00CGNYDIE|4.0|Nice logical game and, despite what some people have said, easy to learn and entertaining to play.  It is not time-based, so best for people who just want to pass the time.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This app is really really boring and frustrating. I get angry at this app all the time. It is not worth it. Once I got it I played and then I uninstalled it.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I very much enjoyed Doctor Sleep but was having a hard time managing my expectations and comparing to The Shinning.  Maybe more like a 3 1/2
B00881VLCE|3.0|This app is okay but if you do not pay for the five dollar edition you might get annoyed at this application.
082221900X|4.0|nice typical kafka. like that the authors completed the story to avoid yet another guesswork. for the purists that won't work, but for those who read kafka for fun, it definitely adds to the experience.
B0012NO4WO|4.0|I've watched it a few times, and I think that Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves do have some of the chemistry we all enjoy in a good romance.  And then there is the action part of it of course which makes it a pleaser for all concerned: some seriously testosterone-ridden scenes with some equally touching moments re: friendship and romance.  Dennis Hopper is at his evil best with maniacal laugh and all.  It's a good time!
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|not nearly up to usual standards for 007 - they need to go back to the drawing board and remake

B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|Excellent travel story with amazing humor.  If you have ever been to Australia, you will understand how accurate it is.  If not, you will surely want to go.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was refreshing in the sense that it &#34;got me&#34;. It's been a long time since I have read a book in which I didn't immediately know the plot twist just from the way it was written in the beginning. That being said, once it (the plot twist- trying to avoid spoilers) became clear the book was almost too predictable and I feel like the ending was rushed and poorly thought out. Great read though!
B007QA3AH2|5.0|If you ever watched the original Star Trek series, you will appreciate Galaxy Quest!  It is great fun and not meant to be taken seriously!  It is one of those movies you find your self quoting lines from.  After all, if the movie wasn't that good, you usually don't do quotes from it.
B0042ESTQW|5.0|This silicone case is a must have for anyone riding out there with the Edge 800 in the handle bar. I made a bad landing after a jump and fell, and the Edge got out from its support, landing over some gravel and rocks. The case saved my investment!

B009ZXT4BY|3.0|the only reason I gave this a 3 is because it is a lot like minecraft and that's what I wanted. the bad part is that their is only like 15 minutes to play and I really wanted to keep playing the same world and I dint want to have to keep creating new ones. ow well it was still pretty fun.

B00BPDR3F6|3.0|-On the Signature of all things by Elizabeth Gilbert.<br />This novel was beautifully written with pristine imagery and form, although the author’s choice of vocabulary tended to overreach at times.<br />I was highly impressed with the author's ability to touch base with so many common human conflicts in the telling of one highly privileged female character's nineteenth century life.<br /> I found the prologue completely unnecessary, and while the first half of the book was intriguing, many of the conflicts had no purpose in the telling of the story.<br />The second half began to reach at every unanswerable philosophical question that the human mind can produce, with the author not so much as providing a single clue as to how she felt about those issues.<br />The ending of the book was predictable and unfulfilling for me as a reader, although the main character was able to find some closure. The plot, if a plot was intended, was messy and jumped from one issue to the next with no feeling of sense or direction. Although it was a chronological portrayal of a life, it didn't seem to have a concrete purpose.<br /> All in all, I found this book a pointless read, except maybe for those who are just beginning to seek out philosophy, but be warned you will find no answers here. I would not recommend it to truly deep thinkers because it will leave a bitter taste and an unscratchable itch for something more.
B007Q476KU|5.0|This was a great movie for the entire family (teenagers and adults). It may not be great for younger ones since most of the setting's are during war, But itwas an all around good movie.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|A childhood classic that withstands the test of time! Great for all ages and can show new generation what an old school adventure looks like.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|It had a good plot, and good movement, but some of the images were kind of hard to handle. I wouldnt recommend this one.

B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Wow.  A grad school lecture on genocide and violence in regard to the Holocaust inspired me to watch this film.  This movie was amazing and very thought provoking.  It affected me emotionally.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|It seems as if the creator of this game are solely interested in making cash.  They nickel and dime you to death.  It is extremely difficult to get past certain levels without paying.  It does become addictive and is hard to stop playing, but I'm getting over it.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|Enjoyed the series and using Amazon Prime makes it so easy.  A couple clicks and you are off to watching the show.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Seems to force pay to win.....oh well I'll just have to wait 24hours till my next try.  It's alright since its almost free.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|Excellent plot and cast throughout.  Very quick moving plot w/ a lot of energy and quick thinking by attorneys, clients and courtroom drama.
B00E4W40C4|5.0|I loved this film and definitely think it is the most adult and polished of all the X-Men films. Good performances from all the cast, good action sequences without being too over the top and the extended scenes make for a more brutal and engaging experience. I own the original book the story is based on but cannot give a review of how faithful it is to the source material. However, I loved the film and very glad it focused more on Wolverines journey and made him special more so than Wolverine: Origins did. The director did a great job in my opinion. I would highly recommend this for any X-Men or Hugh Jackman fan...
B00BATG18K|5.0|As usual, Amy Tan spins a truly compelling story line.  I always look forward to everything she writes.  I am trying not to read it too quickly, but that is difficult.  Two thumbs up!

B0056K4VRM|3.0|Despite advertising 24-bit remastering, these CDs do not sound one whit different from the original Columbia and Odyssey CD releases -- which means that the high level of background tape hiss remains.  As for the performances, they have Walter's unique glow in Mozart, but even better are his earlier monaural performances with the New York Philharmonic, released in superior remasterings in the \\"Bruno Walter Edition\\" series (now re-released as a boxed set).  In short, this is a nice set at a cheap price for someone who doesn't already have Walter's Mozart symphony recordings, but for anyone who does it is superfluous.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|HOW DO I GET HELP 0N GAME #23 ?????  i AM ABOUT TO SCREAM!!!  i THINK i NEED INTERVENTION...PLEASE ADVISE
B004K583KA|5.0|For those who want a set of the cantatas on modern rather than period instruments, or for those who just want their Bach well sung and played, this set is a worthy contender.  While the sheer multitude of soloists means that results are sometimes variable, most of the singing is top-notch, with stellar names such as Arleen Auger and Helen Watts leading the way.  Rilling is of course a venerable master of Bach's music, conducting his vocal and instrumental forces in a stye felicitously  about halfway between the monumental approach of Karl Richter from a generation before and period-instrument performances of a generation to come.  It is also much cheaper than the current alternatives (Harnoncourt/Leonhardt, Suzuki, and the ongoing Koopman and Gardiner sets).  This set comes with a CD-ROM of the complete texts and detailed notes in four languages.  (Warning: it prints out at a couple thousand pages!)  In short, you can't go wrong here!
B00B5C0YOO|5.0|Along with backing up apps, it also allows you to see if apps run AdMob or Background Services. I wish I'd tried this app sooner.
B004JC16LC|5.0|This whopping huge set of 107 CDs offers at least one version (for some symphonic works two versions, or excerpts from alternative opera recordings) of every known work in the Wilhelm Furtwaengler discography.  The CDs are housed in a large oblong box, which in turn holds smaller boxes that segregate the CDs thematically by composers or groups of composers (with the 1953 RAI Ring cycle having a box of its own).  The downsides are the skimpy documentation (including no track or disc timings) and the fact that all of these recordings are lifted from a variety of pirate labels (Andromeda, Archipel, Arkadia, Grammophon 2000, Iron Needle, etc., etc.) in transfers that are significantly inferior to those that the most famous recordings have enjoyed on Orfeo, Music & Arts, Audite, etc.  Still, many of the lesser works have never appeared in top-notch transfers, and so here you can get the whole schmeer dirt cheap.  It does include a small booklet, a CD-ROM with computer files  of the booklet and the complete contents of the set, and two copies of a VD (in different formats) of Prof. Joachim Kaiser discussing Furtwaengler (including Kaiser taking pot-shots at Toscanini). For Furtwaengler fans, this is a no-brainer -- get it!.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is great for helping the baby sleep. I enjoy the music & sounds myself. Some things in life that are free are good!
B0000042GM|4.0|After half a century, this set still holds up as one of the best complete surveys of the solo piano music of Brahms.  It was the edition on which I cut my teeth as a youth; and if Martin Jones on Nimbus has since succeeded this as my preferred set, this edition is still a most worthy contender.  Look up the 2-CD set of Katchen's recordings of the two concertos as well!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Daniel Craig and the screen writers of &#34;Casino Royale,&#34; &#34;Quantum of Solace,&#34; and now &#34;Skyfall,&#34; have returned to the core of Ian Fleming's original character, abandoning all the cartoon characters and phony stunts found in so many of the Roger Moore films. Bond is an &#34;R&#34; rated individual, not a &#34;PG&#34; one as depicted in all previous film versions. He's ruthless and cold and &#34;Skyfall&#34; shows this to the extreme. Ian Fleming would be proud of this film as well as its two previous Daniel Craig versions. Having been raised on Sean Connery as James Bond, I was never a fan of anyone else in Bond's skin... not until Craig. It is, however, far more the screen writers and directors sticking to Ian Fleming's original vision that the credit should go. If you love Bond, this movie will not disappoint.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Beautiful story! Definitely will read the next book. Cant wait to see what will happen next and who will katniss choose.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A simple game that is so much fun. It is easy to get so caught up making matches that you forget the goal. And before you know it you lost a life. I am glad it makes you wait to get your lives back because it would be hard to put the game down otherwise. I'm not on facebook so friends can't help.
B008JFUO72|2.0|The most helpful critical review is right on the money.  Nothing much to add to that except this:<br /><br />Am I the only one that think the overall message of the movie is lame? Sure, Stark is very persistent and try his best to overcome his challenges but this whole Ms. Potts thing  is ridiculous. Who is Tony Stark is this movie? Some teenager having his first crush?<br /><br />In the movie you will find statements like ( made by Stark or by other people but he is agreeing):<br /><br />A) &#34;I (Stark) have nightmares and the only reason I did I not lost it is  because of you(Potts)&#34;;<br />B) &#34;I don't deserve her&#34;;<br />C) the iron man suits are a distraction&#34;;<br />D) you did not like the giant bunny I gave you ? ( not asked in a ironic way, but in a very, very pathetic one by Stark);<br /><br />And the movie goes on and on about this poor tormented soul that can only be a real man in the presence of the one thing he cherish the mostl : Ms. pepper pots.<br /><br />Please, I am not against love message in movies, but I like empowering ones, like he is on his path and she is supportive ( or vice versa). She may even be in danger and he is willing to sacrifice everything for her, but because he is a MAN not some child/loser that can't keep it together without her.<br /><br />The  movie reaches a new level of stupidity when SHE saves him and then, get this, he gives up being iron man ( well, at least this ending was in harmony with the rest of the movie: Tony is a loser and in the end reaches rock bottom all the while thinking he is doing amazing).<br /><br />Well, this is my opinion. Many of you will differ but keep in mind this is Tony Stark we are talking about not Forrest Gump.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Movie had a lot of action and kept my attention throughout. Daniel Craig is a different type of James Bond
B00GUJP9PG|5.0|I think you will have lots of fun do you want to play malteplayer with brothers and sisters yes have fun.
B00D7NWTSI|4.0|Ostensibly, this is a superlative cinematographic piece. Mr Downey Jr has made the 'Iron man' role his own. The pyrotechnics, CGI, & acting skill-set of all the principal characters are without flaw; it is the darkest offering of the trilogy, & a conscionable masterpiece in its own right. I have given it a four star rating, primarily because it does have all of the aforementioned attributes, but there is something lacking in the dynamic - the drive of the first two movies (inexorably) clearly gave licence to this last, but I would consider that 'Tony Stark's' (latter) persona might well have been &#34;examined&#34; earlier in the saga. Obviously, the darker denouement that transpires within our hero, completes his development, but the loss of so much of his arid humour (even within the adversity of the storyline) deprives the viewer of what is, ultimately, the man in the suit. Furthermore, the inclusion of the little boy's plight as a sidekick, was rather overdone - it added nothing to the plot, & merely contrived to be an unnecessary hindrance to the core theme of the whole film - it was schmaltzy, to say the least, if not sickly sweet. The format extras bouyed-up this purchase (from the USA) - the British release of the same (as is always the case), was sadly lacking in features. All this said, it was a more than adequately packaged production, but one would hope that this is the finale - a fourth movie would be a characteristic mistake (but then I am not a member of any appropriations committee from the Marvel studios). I think Iron Man would inevitably 'rust', & disintegrate.
B00DQZT5ZM|4.0|I liked my standing leather case for my Kindle fire HD 8.9 much better.  I am hoping amazon will come out with one for the Kindle fire HDX 8.9.  This one is nice.  I am disappointed that it doesn't have the sleep/wake up feature.  I really like the color.  Better than expected.  All in all it is a doable case.

B004GYY714|2.0|The stations are pre listed so you really can't tune in to what you want to hear on the free version, not sure about the paid version cause if the free one don't live up to anything, I don't think it would be worth the purchase.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was very disappointed with this 3rd book of the series.  I was a big fan of the first book and I enjoyed the 2nd book.  For this 3rd book, I finished reading it out of curiosity and hoped that it would get better as it went along.  It didn't.  I found it boring, predictable, and unexciting.  The concept was neat but the characters and the relationship between Tris and Four was predictable and the characters weren't developed.  Nothing in the story was suspenseful.  Without giving away the ending, I was surprised at the lack of emotion in those events.  If you are loyal to the series then read it for the same curiosity but don't expect much entertainment.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I have Been waiting for this game to come on this tablet. When I got it I couldn't stop playing this game. I was happy
B002E2M3KM|2.0|For the price that I paid for this, I probably shouldn't complain too much - but the record manufacturer really needs to work on quality control.  I opened what was supposed to be a brand new record, and the vinyl is riddled with smudges and full-fledged hand prints all over it.  I think that they played frisbee with it at the factory.<br /><br />I'm not talking about a couple of fingerprints, either... the entire disc is covered in smudges and desperately needs cleaned.

B0007LGCB8|5.0|I have had three pair of Keen Newports and the leather &#34;Bison&#34; trim is by far the coolest looking.  The other two pair that I had lasted for well over a year, with daily wear in everything from snow (when I'd slip them on to go start the car or take out the trash) to hot sand when we's take the kids to the beach.<br /><br />The thing that I like most is the fact that I can just slip them on quickly and then slip them off.  They are comfortable when I wear them all day long doing physical activity.  With my last pair, I would mow the grass and then hose them off, let them dry and then slip them back on to go out with the family.  So, there is my dysfunctional use model and they hold up well under that kind of stress -- for a minimum of a year of hard wear.

B002RT2BXQ|3.0|It is difficult to rate this movie objectively. I have just finished reading the book so it's impossible to be objective when I already know every single word said in the movie. Of course the audio version of the book is around 40 hours long, maybe even longer. There are significant limitations. I agree with the other comments that the movie is incredibly overacted. The characters in the book are much more cool, calm, thoughtful, collected and calculating. The casting is okay. But I honestly think in the film Patricia Neal as Dominique Francon really nails it and steals the show in the screeen version. In the book she is a bit over the edge as in the movie. I also agree with another review that Gary Cooper is too mature for the screen role of Roark. This aspect is utterly shocking. But Ayn Rand was supposedly in love with him, so I get it. In the book Roark is in his early 20's at the beginning of the story. Roark is not this slow moving old guy we see in the movie. It's the very opposite actually. For those of you who love this movie and have never read the book, I honestly don't know what to say to you. The book is so incredibly long and detailed. It's like savoring a drop of fine wine when you have the whole winery right there for the taking. I mean really... people. It would be great if The Fountainhead were redone as a big budget miniseries.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|Many activities.  Some are more educational than others but they at least make my daughter think.  This is one of her favorite games!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app sometimes gets difficult but it makes you want to try harder and when you upgrade it gets a bunch of new locations and costumes some of them are hilarious! I have to admit I loose a lot it I keep going and my high score is 85,421
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Beware this game is addicting. Lots of fun of all ages. I'm 23 and love is as well as my cousin who is 6.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The game levels were challenging enough for a short diversion without requiring hours to solve.  I enjoyed it on my morning and afternoon commutes.
0374531269|5.0|An amazing, humbling and courageous tale.  It's inspiring to witness what the human spirit can endure.  This should be what our children are reading in school!  Nothing less than 5 stars could do this book justice.
B009APMNB0|5.0|The picture on my monitor always looks pretty good to me, whether I'm spending time manipulating the image in Photoshop or Light Room, or uploading an image to the web.  I was shocked to see how some of my \\"better\\" images looked when printed at a professional lab though.  Colors that were bright and vibrant on the screen looked dull and muddy on the print.<br /><br />At first I thought the differences were solely a question of the print looking duller because it wasn't backlit as the monitor.  Then I took a general photography class that touched on the subject and the instructor couldn't seem to emphasize enough the importance of calibrating the monitor as an important step in getting the printed output you're after.  (We even went on tour of a local photo lab and the owner showed us how some of the files that had been sent to them for printing appeared on their lab's calibrated monitors - dull burgundy where there should have been vivid reds, etc.  I'm sure the photographer thought it looked fine on the monitor at home though.<br /><br />The X-Rite CMUNSML ColorMunk Smile is my first experience with calibration software.  It was easy to install and set-up, and I was pleased with the results.<br /><br />As a test, I printed printed a set of photos (taken of Coca-Cola memorabilia, so lots of vivid red and white colors), then I calibrated the monitor, adjusted for color changes with Photoshop and printed the same photos again; reds were more \\"true\\" and less \\"ochre\\"; whites were more of a bright white without blue-tinged edges.  It made a big difference!<br /><br />Once you realize the importance of color calibration, you'll want to run the software regularly (about once every 1-2 weeks) to keep it accurate and your pictures looking good.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|Have been a Tolkien fan since the mid 70s. Love the extended versions of The Lord of The rings and the extended version of The Hobbit was up to my expectations. Loved the extras that were added in. The extra 15 minutes wasn't an added scene but a minute or two added here and there. The dwarfs bathing in the fountain at Rivendale was hilarious.
B005HEDL8M|5.0|The Original Star Trek (referred to as TOS among Trekkies) is long in tooth. I was in HIGH SCHOOL when it was originally aired, so it's now almost a half century old and nowhere near as sophisticated as the popular TNG (Next Generation) with Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard or Deep Space Nine (DS9) which was extraordinarily well-produced and written. But if you are an original Trekkie, the TOS has its moments and it's based on the classic science fiction \\"pulp magazine\\" writing of the Fifties and some of the writers are actually the luminaries of that age (Robert Bloch, Norman Spinrad, Harlan Ellison, and Theodore Sturgeon.)<br /><br />The scenery was the usual cardboard, plastic wrap, aluminum ducts and styrofoam, with plastic blocks illuminated by light bulbs (in one scene, you can see the incandescent bulbs shining inside what is purported to be a container for a life-force but is a big fiberglass spherical lampshade in reality.) To our sophisticated eyes, it looks dated. And cheap. The rocks are covered by some kind of flocked carpet and along with the fake plants, terribly cheap looking. But the remastered backdrop shots are fantastic. The planets are sharp and detailed, the cityscapes have much more detail and are beautifully rendered. In one planet shot, I was pretty much convinced that the picture was the Amazon basin from the air, as satellite photos and digitally created art were unknown at that time. It looks wonderful in high def.<br /><br />You can also admire the costuming skill. The designers had a fetish for bare backs and gravity-defying bodices that were very amusing. Some don't fit very well (Shahna's bodice in \\"Gamesters of Triskelion\\" looks ready to fall off at any moment as does Droxine's (The Cloud Minders.) But that may be some of the attraction for the male viewers. Will it, won't it?<br /><br />The acting is full of Shatner's tendency to chew the scenery, and the first few shows have Spock barking orders as if he's on a clipper ship, not a space ship. They get over this pretty quickly, and the first season is actually possibly the BEST season, which goes against the newer formula of Star Treks pretty much being awful until after the THIRD season. It's also nice to admire in higher def how handsome Shatner was in his salad days. And you can also admire the acting skill of DeForest Kelley, who I think was under-appreciated.<br /><br />These are welcome remastered classics and fun to watch if you love older science fiction and Star Trek. For those born in the Nineties, this will seem as corny as the Dr. Whos with Tom Baker. But retro is also cool these days.<br /><br />**I'm reviewing the instant download (not a DVD) fyi.a space ship.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I really like  this app because its really fun and interactive and I really like the costumes and the different scenery.The only thing I dont like os the fact it requires wifi which not everyone has acess to.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Great story line that includes both romance and lots of action sequences. The movie is visually exciting, almost believable and fun to watch.
0385537131|5.0|I have been waiting for Jakes  return and he is back. I like Grishams lighter books, but this genre is my favorite. I am so happy to read a book that truly moves me. The characters are real and represent what might have been a real event, save the trial. I grew up in this area and cry as I think of the way life has been and sometimes is in the south.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I have a low metabolism, take thyroid pills, and am a low to moderate exercise person. Over the past four years or so, the pounds have crept up and none of the diets I've tried have work, not until The FastDiet! What a success! I've lost the pounds, can wear my skinny jeans again, and I look and feel great! If you have a slow metabolism, this might be the key for you, too. Be sure and read the book first, it is well worth the investment.
B008AIGWVA|3.0|My 6yrold thinks this game is hilarious. The dog throws a bottle and you can smack him in the face. I'm not so sure about it myself but I guess its harmless. He does not say anything inappropriate.
B005906INY|5.0|Both very funny and very clever, with some surprisingly touching scenes throughout the movie.  I remember seeing this when it first came out and thinking it was hilarious, but seeing it years later just made me enjoy it even more.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I fully recommend this book although painful and disturbing most of the time, it is still a beautiful book to read

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Bought this at Best Buy for $35+tax. Amazing product! I currently use this for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2. It was fast and easy to set up, and works wonders. Best part is I can still use my phone as normal while the video is streaming!

B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I like this game because you don't have to ask friends for help on quests. You can complete them by doing it yourself. Fun game
B008XG1X18|4.0|Although I can't find many things wrong with this app except I wish it was more like My phone. Where as on my phone once I hold down  a different  pin and it allows me to like it or place it on one of my boards<br /> or send it to someone without actually opening up the pin

B00BU9DXAY|5.0|This little work is perfect. It brings to light all the delightful things about our fuzzy friends along with the less desirable traits (although those remain hilarious). It will make you tear up a little in response to the genuine sentiment about how much love dogs can bring to your life.

0316055433|3.0|The Goldfinch is an Old Dutch masters painting by Carel Fabritius (he was a pupil of Rembrandt’s and a tutor of Vermeer’s) that, through horrible circumstances, comes into the possession of a 12-year-old boy in Donna Tartt’s new book of the same name.  The story follows this child, and this painting, through harrowing circumstances and I thought (from the day I read the first review) what a great, I mean great! idea.  Ms. Tartt even gets to wax poetic about art in general and the little painting in particular.<br /><br />Although the premise of the book is fascinating and starts with a bang I’m afraid I’m not a huge fan.  Our young hero starts out as a charming, likable misfit and you fall for him early.  Unfortunately, he starts to grow up and he pretty much turns into an awful teenager and then, ugh, an adult with zero morality.  In real life you might forgive him for his trespasses because of the tragedies visited upon him (and those around him), but in fiction you need to (at least I do) love your protagonist, not just understand why he’s a butthead.<br /><br />I figure Theo is about 27 at the conclusion of the novel, which ends with another bang, but he barely redeems himself in my eyes (and heart).  Ms. Tartt wraps up her loose ends pretty well and then, oh horrors, the waxing begins ad nauseum.  Her philosophizing grew old for me and there was way too much word play (“shock and aura” for god’s sake!) as she makes her bid for relevant “literature.”  I don’t like being preached to, or rather maybe it’s being “lectured at” (she even addresses us, her dear readers, directly), and I just wish she had foregone that last 15-20 pages of her conclusion.  Oh, I liked the book well enough; most of it, but it would have been a major coup de literature if it had come in at about 571 pages, rather than the 771 her editors allowed.
B005TBWN0K|4.0|4 sizes of brushes, frames, &amp; highlighted. Colors finder for pictures. Only complaint is that the cropping function is not very precise. Otherwise, really fun.

B00GH4RKYM|4.0|Henry Cavill delivers a outstanding performance. Action packed and superbly performed. A truly fantastic performance in keeping with the American version of Superman ! The special effects are superb The acting, stellar keeps you glued to your seat awaiting the next move by the Hero and the villains. . .  I may never grow too old for this Super Hero. Man of Steel is awesome.

B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Fun so far. Hard to get  the crowns you need to get certain items. A good time waster on a slow day.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|I think this game is  awesome although  challenging. It's very fun, I  recomend  it to every one.works  really good on  kindle. fires.
B00A2FSSHK|5.0|I enjoy the plot twists and paranoia of a PKD story.  Cruise did a believable job.  The CG didn't overwhelm and ruin the movie.  It has an actual plot.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|People use the term \\"I couldn't put it down!\\" This is one of those books.  Full of action, great characters, suspense, and it leaves you eager for more.
B00G32QIEG|2.0|Ghosts try to take over the world, blah, blah, blah.  Been there done that.  Same old plot.  Not as funny as other movies that told the same story.  Tries to be serious and absurd at the same time.  That never flies for me.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A work of art. Well written. Loved the word images and the haunting, yet at the same time beautiful story of this young girl.
B00EQF2EIG|4.0|Joss Whedon makes this 400 year-old play ultimately heartwarming -- not so easy to do with Shakespeare, I think.  This is a very accessible and enjoyable adaptation.  Good date-night movie.
B008J8KBKY|2.0|I tried playing this on a 7 inch tablet.  It was too small and I couldn't see the layers.  It is probably a fine game, just not for a small tablet.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I have been looking for game like this since I got my kindle. u should get this game. its awesome
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game.  It teaches you what you need to do as you go along.  It has great graphics.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|greatest game ever!  Everyone is playing it!  Even older people love it! I'm old and I love it.  friends and family who never play games like this are playing it!
1609611543|5.0|Everyone needs to read this book and make a very important decision about thier health.  Dr. Davis gives very valid points and backs up his advice and theories with scientific data.  Reading this book was a light bulb moment for me and I can honestly say that I will make every effort to eliminate wheat from my diet for the rest of my life.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|LOVED THIS BOOK. It may not be the perfect storybook ending - but it was thought provoking and most importantly, both selfless and BRAVE.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|My wife got me into this game. I had tried earlier versions and did not like them. This game has converted me.
B003M70O5O|5.0|The best and most entertaining show that Fox has ever produced, and the only thing since the Simpsons I would ever watch.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's frustrating to have to wait for your friends to &quot;advance&quot; you to the next level every so often.... otherwise it's a fun game.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I updated hoping for more options, now I can't access my gifts. I can't get more lives that people gifted me. This sucks!! After I use the five lives, it's done.
B000KIE11Q|3.0|This watch it very nice, the only problem is that the plastic part of the bad gets ripped off very fast.. I changed 3 bands in 2 years each one costing me $60!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The writing style was difficult at first but once I got past that I'd say it was one of the best books I have read in a long time.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This author wrote an amazing book and doesnt deserve to be crucified for writing a realistic book (as far as not everything being all sunshine and rainbows in the end). If you want a book where you get to decide the ending then try writing one and publish it and see where you get.<br /><br />When I saw that there was such a mix of reviews I knew this book was going to be good. For the level headed people they understand she told the story as it should have happened and gave it a good review. The hero saves the day but cant always save their own life and are willing to sacrifce. For the whining babies who dont understand that and need everything to be perfect, someday they will figure out things dont always turn out perfect.<br /><br />Which is why I read the book and thoroughly enjoyed it. When an author can illicit so many emotions in a book you know it is going to be good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It's fun and keeps you on your toes. One of my top favorite games out right now
B0054JZC6E|5.0|one of the best games I have ever played it is really really really fun and kind of hard but still fun
B000H79JYE|2.0|Very poor sound quality, although there are no scratches.<br />Possibly due to dirt on the tracks there is a lot of extraneous noise.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Fun addictive game good team building would be nice to have a chat feature.alot lile farmville<br /><br />The combat is odd...but fun good game
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is so epickly realistic it is so awesomely awesome I love hunting white tail deer In real life. It is awesome.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|The story was absorbing, the characters in turn were very real. Though some accomplished some incredible feats, the suspense continues until the end. A great read.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|The long awaited 50th anniversary special was fantastic!!  It gave the show an entirely new and exciting storyline to follow for the next season. It was also fabulous to have multiple doctors in one episode...oh David Tennant, how I miss you!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a cute game and fun and can be addicting.<br /><br />I am editing my previous review since Amazon customer service went above and beyond and refunded me $19.99 for a bunch of tokens I bought from the in-app purchasing of this game.  Please note, it was Amazon who helped me out and NOT the company who made this game.  Their customer service does nothing to help.  Only Amazon helped when I did not get any help from this game's customer service.<br /><br />So only for Amazon, am I going to give this game 5 stars and not for the company that produce this video game. Besides, it is not the games fault.  The game is great and fun to play.  A lot of fun.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for the first class customer service!!!

B00DQZT5ZM|1.0|My new Belkin Chambray Cover arrived defective with three dented lines across the front cover, therefore I sent it back for a refund.  For $45 it should not have had any flaws.  The case appeared to be flimsy and the top part of the folding back cover is only glued on, so I honestly don't know how long this case would have lasted.  What I did like about the case was the color &#34;Sorbet&#34; and an elastic closure.  I'm not a big fan of having anything magnetic close to my electronic devices, so that was why I was drawn to this case in the first place.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Never ever thought I'd be saying this...but I LOVE CANDY CRUSH!!!!! (LOL) I have been wondering what the big deal was with this candy crush...and now I kno! Tried it once and was addicted! I have now joined the rest of the candy crush junkies!!
B00GWEPPE4|1.0|So I see that viewers will lower their standards right along with the show so there is no reason for it to improve. There is no reason to think up some truly interesting characters if people will settle for Governor No-Chin or Carol as someone to focus on. I gave the writers this season a chance and am actually surprised that this season is worse.<br /><br />I don't expect anyone to have the guts to change the title of the show since this is no longer The Walking Dead. This is just some very low-budget bore-fest using the name. The guy who created the show had guts but he apparently was the only one. Now on screen it's just a creep moping around in slow motion talking slow and oh look, now he is killing everyone and he's going to be the Governor again. Pitiful. No new ideas at all....even with all that potential. A sickness at the prison? Wow. What does it matter when there is no longer any clear reasons to live accept, like the zombies, to just keep on going? I guess the character of Carol was supposed to really embody that? Yawn.<br /><br />They are probably still at the prison just because of the budget but then why spend more money when people will love it whether they provide the epic-ness of a cop riding into a city experiencing the \\"zombie apocalypse\\" on a horse or whether it's a bunch of nobodies hanging out in trailers getting picked off by the psycho? Whether it's a dynamic as hell character like Shane or whether it's some pouty-faced manchild obsessed with commandeering a family. Who cares? Besides all that, if it is all about misery and degeneration then why bother? What is the point?<br /><br />I don't know what is worse though. The show that thinks the Governor is lead character material or reading all of these reviews of people talking themselves into thinking the show is great or those who feel that they need to respond to bad reviews and defend this mediocrity.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best video game of them all.......lol although I keep falling off the balcony on the other board level
B00G32OER4|3.0|I love a good horror movie, especially those that aren't run of the mill slasher-type junk. That's I waited some time to stream The Conjuring after seeing the great reviews and trailer. OK for a rental, some decent scares, but IMO didn't nearly live up to its &#34;scariest movie&#34; billing. Actually, I thought Mama was creepier. If you thought The Conjuring was scary, try Mama. Scary, creepy, and Jessica Chastain was excellent, as were the 2 young girls. Mama, IMO, was the most underrated horror movie of the last few years, while The Conjuring was one of the most overrated.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Denzel was terrific as always.  Film was suspenseful and the flight scenes were horrific.  Nice they didn't take the easy way out with the ending.
B00ENFS0F0|5.0|What more is there to say?<br /><br />Paramount/CBS Video have outdone themselves with the restoration of these episodes.  Watching them on this format is truly watching them as never seen before.  The clarity and color reproduction is eye-popping, the audio immersive and the revised special effects are spectacular while paying respect to the original production.  THIS is how you bring a great classic to Blu-ray!<br /><br />Now it's time to see the same treatment for Star Trek: DS9 and Voyager.  :-)
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great app, lot of fun! I would recommend for the sports enthusiast but not for young children. Works great on the Kindle Fire HD.
B00CZ7OC46|4.0|While not containing any earthshaking revelations, Remote is conductive to some interesting reflections on how people work in your company.  This is true regardless of wether they are working remotely or not.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|As they say, &#34;&#34;easy-peasy&#34;. Fast install, worked first time out of the chute. Highly recommend for HP WiFi printers. Works with any similar printer. You can print anywhere with this app. Try it, you'll like it.
B00013M6NK|2.0|I have purchased several of these batteries through the years and they lasted for years.  The charge lasted a long time too.  The last two I purchased in 2012, were lighter feeling and the charge doesn't last half as long as the older batteries did.  I almost wondered if these were really Nikon company batteries or made by some other company.
B00969PR18|1.0|not a very good mapping system. recommend you get a tom tom or something that is more practical. Forget it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Veronica Roth ruined this series for me! Tobias was a whiny sissy boy the whole time, and the whole scenario was pointless. Veronica really messed up by killing off Tris for no apparent reason. What were her publishers thinking by allowing her to do this? And what was up with Tobias' parents at the end? They are both control hungry, heartless people and Tobias comes in and says give up your rein or loose me and she says &#34;oh ok, I'll walk away from everything I've worked for&#34; and then we go to dad and tell him to leave the city. After he has been fighting to gain control of the city he says &#34;oh, you want me to give up and disappear, ok sure see ya!&#34; Yeah right!!! And what was up with the information overload in the federal building? I kept thinking 'ok, need to remember this stuff cause its gonna be important later' but no, it was never important or even mentioned again. I was really looking forward to this book and the movie coming out in march, but was highly disappointed and really don't think I will be watching the movie. Who would want to when you know this is all for nothing and your main character is just gonna die a senseless death in the end! I realize Veronica was probably going for the shock and awe approach, but it was just a major let down!
1439156816|5.0|Like most things King writes, this nails it.  I like the easy to read format chock full of his own experiences, how he goes about it, why, etc. and just tidbits of his life experiences.  It seems so easy... a sure sign that it is all crafted from within.  Totally helpful.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this app helps me a lot with fixing my pics. i love this app. you can change the backgrounnd and add a fantastic border. you can do a lot pf things with this app! this app is out of this world! get it now before they start making you pay money for it!
1401937519|5.0|Well written, simple to follow story which tells an amazing documented true account of one young woman recovery from the edge of death. This book challenges all our belief systems about life and death and pushes us to open to a new way of perceiving reality, thinking about what is possible and how powerful we all really are.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|As expected from Sanderson. Another great book. I can't really really put in words how much I love this guy's books. Definitely recommend this and all his other works.
B0038OY6DW|5.0|Love this series!!! The relationship between them is great. I don't the Robert Downey Jr. could do no wrong in a movie the last few years. Just love him.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book is the reason i began to read Grisham.  A well told story without sex or poor words.  i reccomend.  For a while I thought he had lost it.  Well written, with good type and spaceing.  WHOOPE. Good read.
B00FY2UFRM|1.0|Sooooooo disappointed in this movie. We can't believe how bad it was. A five year old could have written a better scrip. My husband and I really wanted to see this when it came out, as we are big Fast & Furious fans. However, we never made it to the theater. Thank God we missed it and saved the money. Sorry we wasted the instant video fee. We had a really hard time making it to the end of the movie.
B000Q7Q2WM|5.0|I imagine this movie to end up a cult classic, similar to Pulp Fiction. Quentin Tarantino does a fine job a poking fun at the old Kung-Fu movies from Asia, with gallons of spurting blood from wounds inflicted by Thurman's Samurai sword, to a Kato wanna-be who can fly; If only he had used dubbed English for the Asian actors, he would have been spot on. Thurman does a job of playing the psychotic revenge seeker, and you can't help but laugh at the psycho tune that plays every times she starts to fight somebody, to what she says to them herself.<br /><br />It is said that Tarantino  and Thurman came up with the idea for this movie, and they did a good job of it. From laughs, to gallons of blood.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|This was a really good movie. I ordered it for my kids and ended up really liking it. My husband also enjoyed it.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Thought at first glance it would be boring. Luckily as it turns out, the game is pretty cool. The fantasy aspect is a nice change of pace.
B005HNMPBM|5.0|We are fans of this series and a must see if you like the original series and future films coming out a long with wolverine.
B0076HN3T0|5.0|This is a fun and fascinating documentary about the Foo Fighters. Great for any fan. Lots of great footage I had not seen before.
B00CLZ4B4I|2.0|Enjoyed the special effects, they were great. Hated the wizard. Maybe it was the actor, I don't know. The sisters were great.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am in love with this game I play it every day after school. If you don't have this game then you need richer it.
B00FQPHOPI|5.0|Really a great movie. Very pleasantly surprised. I really didn't want to see this because of the old superman movies and how bad they were and expected this to be another bad movie. Well this is a great movie, nothing like the old ones. I'm sure there are a lot of people like me who did not get into the first Superman movies and had little interest in this one. Not sure if they are planning sequels, but would love one.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I heart is heavy as I write this, as Mr. Clancy recently passed away.  This book puts Jack Ryan and company back in charge.  For a political swing on it, this and the last two novels are so closely linked with todays Washington mess it makes one wonder why this novel seems so real.  And I just read in the newspapers this morning that China is ...
B00FXMGI0G|5.0|We love this series and were so excited to see Red 2. Again this is one our whole family loves and that is hard to do. This is a great series. Make sure to see the first one. Won't be disappointed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love this story Suzanne Collins did a fantastic job.<br />This is a trilogy that people of all ages can enjoy.  Wondering if there will. E any others after mocking jay
B00G70WLJA|5.0|Well we are a Wolverine fan along with x-men so it would be hard to be disappointed. My family really enjoyed this movie and you have to keep watching through the credits. You won't be disappointed.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Read this book many years ago. Heard an interview on NPR with john talking about his new book. Forgot how spellbinding mr. Grisham is as a story teller. Interesting case study of deep rooted racism and the constant double standard. Great read....
B004EBZX6W|4.0|It works but would be oh-so better if it was also a spectrum analyzer. But, for free, I'm not complaining.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, must read before seeing the Movie. I think I enjoyed the movie much more than I would of if I didn't read it first.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|so simple to use. Took a whole 5 minutes to set up and stream from my google tab! I just wish I could get this to work with my Ipad.
B000I8G594|5.0|I only look into real movies when i really enjoy them.  This one was really good.  It was easier to grasp some thing after I read the iMDB review first.
B00351ZUHY|5.0|I really enjoyed watching Kevin Bacon perform his gymnastic routine and of course his dance moves. Watching Kevin his friend how to dance was very entertaining..
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun, interesting and challenging!  Keeps you thinking, working and wanting more. This game is very addictive. So hard to stop trying to get to the next room.
B00EEDNA4M|2.0|Words cannot describe the excitement I had when I saw the box on my porch. Then 15 minutes later, I wanted to cry... because I was on the phone with Amazon Customer Service for ten minutes organizing a replacement because the second disc of Season Five was not there.<br />I'm not sure if this is Sony's fault in distribution or Amazon's fault from a previous return, but now I have to make a trip to the post office and wait five more days and pray to God that this next one actually contains the entire \\"complete\\" set.
B002LU0E26|1.0|I hate this movie. Its just a flat out joke of a superman movie. just when you think the its going to take off and get good... it doesn't. complete waste of three hours of my life i'll never get back.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read the book in two sittings which is so unlike me. Usually read a few chapters a night before bed. But this book I couldn't put down.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|This movies saving grace is that its so cheesy and chuck norris tells a chuck norris joke. the plot is just plain awful lots of action tho.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|It was wordy and heavy-handed much like all of King's work, but I still found myself up till 2am unable to stop turning pages. I appreciated the pitting of female protagonist against female antagonist, even if the character development wasn't richly developed-but this is genre fiction, so what does one expect? Mostly I was happy to learn what had happened to poor Danny all those years after the Overlook almost had the best of him. I think the development of that story was well done.<br />Over all, this was a fun, fast-paced, and just spooky enough read from someone who hasn't put out a good horror book in quite some time.
B00EO10M54|4.0|Oh, $%!#. The new short haired, tongue out, forever twerking Miley Cyrus has definitely shed the Disney princess role.<br /><br />Take a deep breath. It’s okay if you were shocked and disapproved at first. But let me tell you, you must get out of the denial stage that old Miley will come back, she won’t. Trust me, every girl has to grow up. I mean I definitely didn’t picture Miley Cyrus like this, but I feel at this point in age, and after a heart break, you want a change. You want a fresh start. To do what you’ve always wanted, and have no regrets. Miley is doing that for herself. So we must let Miley do Miley, and accept her new ways.<br /><br />I at first opposed the change because she was like my Hannah Montana home girl. This new change had me like, “Are ya kiddin’ me?” Now, I’m hooked. Her new sound is modern, country, and pop. She is radical, let alone following the status quo. Her voice’s talents is still displayed and tells a story about her love and heartbreak from Liam in her songs. “Adore You”, “Drive”, and “FU” are just some of the few that describe her love story falling from grace.<br /><br />Obviously Miley Cyrus had to break out and express herself, differently. Rihanna’s done it, Lady Gaga, Madonna-- All have done provocative showmanship of expression in their music, wardrobe and identity. Miley is 21 for crying out loud! She’s bound to break out, and she came with a force of nature.<br /><br />She’s everywhere, she’s revolutionizing, and she is above all, evolved. She’s a new independent woman, doing her and even as she put it, only your happiness is what matters at the end of the day, and it’s up to you to make that happen. I’m an official “Smiler”, and support Miley in her change. She had the courage to step up into this world and change her image. “Do my Thang” is her new national anthem chanting this new independence.<br /><br />This country superstar offspring grew up around music, and she knows music. Whether you disagree or not, she executed her goal: re-inventing herself.<br /><br />The collaborations she’s done on this album are paradoxical to her style which proves other artist want to collaborate with this new Miley, and support enough to make music with her with their name added to it. It affects their music careers just as much as it affects her own. Artists such as Future, French Montana, Ludacris, and the legendary Britney Spears partnered up with Ms. Miley. What other country affiliated artist did collabs like that? She’s doing what hasn’t be attempted before. She’ll soon make a new genre of music: a melting pot of country, hip-hop and pop.<br /><br />Try this when you preview this album: Have an open mind-- c’mon how will you make any friends with that kind of attitude if you don’t try? Next, play the album about 3 times. You’ll go through a metamorphosis journey of how you perceive the new Miley. Miley is now the freewheeling, uncensored woman, that will do whatever she pleases, not feeling she needs everyone's approval and revolutionizing her music, kind of artist.<br /><br />Next time you see Miley strutting that stage, lifting the mic to her lips, sticking her tongue out in that infamous way, twerking like always, know that’s it’s all part of the Miley package now. And when she opens her lips to sing, you’ll hear the old Miley sing out to entertain her fans. This album is a blueprint and stepping stone for what we’re about to see next. We must be prepared. She’s been planning this for a while. Rome wasn’t built in a day.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I have always been interested in WWII - especially the flying and the human aspects. This was quite good, but I didn't think it quite lived up to the reviews. A good read.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|Beautifully written paranormal tale of powerful shape shifters, magical beings, fairies and Oria. the little Golden Queen of the Ahwahneechee tribe. unfolds when Native American Oria plunges into a pool at the base of Bridalveil Fall in Yosemite National Park during a family reunion. It is Oria’s “coming of age” eighteenth birthday and the pool, to her surprise, is a portal to a parallel universe where Oria learns of her special powers in time to fight an impending battle to prevent evil from entering the world of man.<br /><br />Well paced, charming, filled with suspense and angst, as Oria meets Gray Wolf, another supernatural being, who has been awaiting her, “his heart,” as promised by the Great Spirit. Well done. Highly recommended.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|You will get addicted. You will hate some levels but you will love every minute!  I play this almost every day!
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|This series immediately hooked us.  Wow, what a story!  We can never figure out the story line, it's that well written.  Now watching the 3rd season on Showtime, but it's not as powerful a story line as the first two were.  Twists and turns and keeps us waiting for more.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|A sensational book. When I started I couldn't stop. It is a beautifully written book and was an eye opener in a way we take education for guaranteed  in our country but how girls have to struggle to get this basic right in their country. By reading this book I have started valuing more about what we have acheived in our lives. A must read.
B00002SWEM|2.0|too much talking, too little songs, the Video Disk supplied without a book. It is a great disappointment to me. sorry !!
B00A6CCF0K|1.0|I am floored by the number of people who gave this book positive reviews.<br /><br />Mr. King has written some books that I have truly enjoyed. He has also written some real clunkers. In my opinion, he has always been a writer in dire need of an editor who won't suck up.<br /><br />Someone just should have nixed this whole book. It is just a bad book. The characters are poorly written. They are one-dimensional, amateurish, and ridiculously named. I mean cringe-worthy. Abra? Really? Abba-doo? And all the vampires have cute nicknames as well. All of them. It's just stupid. It left me no possibility of suspending disbelief.<br /><br />And the AA stuff? Good Lord,  I felt like I had been jumped by a pack of Jehovah's Witnesses. I'm happy if AA helped,  but keep it to yourself. It's not fun, it wasn't approached well, and I didn't find it interesting or entertaining. It was boring and repetitive and just came off as a half-assed attempt at fleshing out a poorly drawn character.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, if you squint, all of the characters read the same, and are practically interchangeable. King is always at his worst when he tries to draw characters that are too far out of his range.  He seems to have the most trouble with female characters and ethnic characters. He tries so hard to be sensitive, understanding and yet, entertaining, that these two types just come off as embarrassing, tokenistic cliches.  He is at his worst in Dr. Sleep. The character development comes off as juvenile, pretentious, self indulgent and babyish.<br /><br />The plot? Not compelling. Parts of the novel are so over-written, I can only feel that somewhere in there King realized how badly the book sucked and was trying to pull out all the stops to recover from it. It never works.  Once again, a good editor should have told him the truth, and at the very least whittled it down to a crappy short story.<br /><br />Again, I am befuddled that there is even one good review, let alone thousands. Like I said earlier, I think Mr. King has written some great books, right alongside of some dreadful crap. If you loved The Shining, Misery, Thinner, The Long Walk, Pet Semetary, The Gunslinger, and Dead Zone, skip this book. It will just piss you off.Like I said earlier, I think Mr. King has written some great books, right alongside of some dreadful crap.

B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I was just looking for a fun game, and after all, everyone seems to love it.  At first, I enjoyed it, but I got really tired of having to buy more moves, and furthermore, the way the game puts you in &quot;time out&quot; when you have exhausted lives.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun,cool,and so awesome.I love it.Every season or holiday it's close to it updates to look like that holiday.If I had to rate it 1-10 I would rate it as 10.
0804161380|4.0|I have been looking forward to receiving this set since I learned about and pre-ordered it back in August. I am a huge Zelda fan and always wanted to get my hands on the strategy guides, but never seemed to get around to buying them when they first released and, over time, they became very expensive. This works out great because we can get all of the Collector's Edition guides, plus one never released and only available in this set (Ocarina of Time) for a great price - each guide ends up being less than $20 each not including the packaging.<br /><br />As other have said, the packaging is wonderful. The treasure chest box is better quality than I had anticipated and the gold, metal etched bookmark is gorgeous! The actual shipping packaging was great, as well - very well protected with lots of foam so it arrived in pristine shape.<br /><br />The guides themselves are gorgeous! Great detail and amazing artwork. I also love how the paper edges are golden - it gives it a very classy look. I have yet to actually read through them, let alone use them, so I can't say how accurate and useful they are, but I am sure the do their job and then some. I was very concerned about the Skyward Sword guide because the reviews for the original version were absolutely terrible. Fortunately, however, I read that it has been updated to meet the quality of all of the other guides, so that was a huge sigh of relief.<br /><br />I do have a few gripes for this set, though. They are quite minor in the grand scheme of things, so it didn't kill it for me too much - they are just things I wish they would have included.<br /><br />First, I am very disappointed that no guides were made for the older Zelda games, i.e. Zelda I and II for NES, Link to the Past for SNES, LInk's Awakening for Gameboy, etc. I wouldn't even mind if they threw several games into one or two books to make it more efficient - it would just have been nice to have guides for every Zelda game in one set.<br /><br />Second, I wasdisappointed they didn't leave an empty slot for A Link Between Worlds. They've had this planned for a while and have had to have known the game was coming out the same time as this, as well as the collector's edition guide. Not a huge deal, but again... would have been a nice consideration.<br /><br />Third (and this is just something I would have thought to be cool - not dinging this set at all for not doing it) it would have been INCREDIBLE if they had some sort of audio device inside that makes the chest opening music from say Ocarina of Time when you open it - similar to when you open a greeting card with pre-recorded messages. Perhaps someday I will figure out how to do it myself - until then I will have to just sing the tune myself :)<br /><br />Finally, I am sad that some of the bonus content that came with the guides when they were originally released weren't included. I will be honest, I don't know which guides came with what, but I have seen others complain about this, stating that Twilight Princess in particular came with a few goodies.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this set. For Zelda fans, it is a must buy especially if you don't own many or any of these guides already. Thanks for reading!
0739352962|5.0|I can hardly wait till the next book comes out.  It keeps you interested the entire series.  I enjoyed all the books
B002VECMAE|3.0|The movie worked just fine, but the case i received it in had a rip in the plastic and when I opened the case there was white powder all over the disc and the case that I had to clean off the disc, the white powder was hard to get off and I still don't know what that is, but i'm glad i\I noticed it before I put it in my DVD player.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It gets to be very frustrating after awhile. I quit playing for months and have just recently returned to playing it again.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is really fun. It's also totally realistic in everything. I really love this app. The only bad thing is, is that it is really hard to earn gems. But over all I recommend this app to anyone who likes horses.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. I started on facebook but prefer playing on my Kindle Fire. So happy they finally made this game available!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this game its fun and has many upgrades to weapons and ammo and is just plain fun to play
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love the game but are you kidding me gems for mane six like come on be real Gameloft if you really want to make us happy make the mane six cost bits not gems you should have us be able to buy coins with gems too not saying I hate it but I like it but if you want me to love it make the mane six cost bits and maybe let us buy coins with gems .Sorry if u think this offensive
B00821PCJS|5.0|Wonderful TV show. I really enjoyed it.<br />It seems like its mostly about the war between humans and aliens, however, i personally think it actually focuses more on family relationship. It is so amazing how parents will scarifies themselves just to protect their kids. Great show.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game used to play it in my phone n know I also could play it in my kindle I love it :)
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|When I got this game I could not stop playing the price is not bad because it has really good graphics and it is cool that it tells how many kills u have and other things I recommend it
B00425S1H8|5.0|I'm a network engineer and work with older Cisco equipment that often requires me to use a serial connection to do the initial configuration.  I had to replace my old Dell laptop after it was stolen and the new one did not have a serial port.  We have used this same USB to Serial adapter at work with nary a problem so I was psyched to find one for less than what the boss pays.  One observation.  The unit comes with a driver CD and instructions to install the drivers before connecting the adapter to the computer.  That might be true with XP or Vista, but Windows 7 will download a WHCL driver automatically as long as you have an Internet connection when you first plug it in.  I have not had any compatibility issues at all.  I have used it to connect to several different external modems and numerous Cisco routers, switches, and access points and it just works.  UPDATE:  I plugged it into my Vista Pro desktop and the drivers installed automatically.  Works perfectly there as well.  Will test on a Sony Flip Win8 on Christmas and report findings on that as well.  UPDATE, Part Deux:  Works fine on Win 8.1 and Win10.  On my wife's Win8.1 Sony it took a couple of minutes to load the driver.  On my upgraded Win10 Dell 4600 workstation it only took a few seconds to load the drivers.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really like this book alot better than the movie. They left alot out and its really sad, but either that it's a great book can't wait to read the next book !
080214473X|5.0|Love the book and love the story.  It is based on a true story and it is really compelling.  Had a friend that was actually there when it all went down and I have a whole new appreciation for the events of this day/night.

B0045LSIRM|5.0|Went to the concert and it was fantastic.  Had to purchase the CD. If you love his music you will love this version of it.
B009H75B2E|5.0|This new recording by the Dunedin Consort is the most interesting and welcome recording I have heard in quite a while.  But I didn't like it right away.  There are at least two aspects of this recording that deserve attention, the musicianship and the sound quality.  As to the former, *sublime* doesn't seem to be adequate.  It's as if I were hearing this music for the first time.  I don't know how Mr. Butt and his Dunedin players have accomplished this.  If you buy the CD version of this, you'll get a very interesting and informative essay in the accompanying booklet, where you'll find out about the latest debates in early music performance practice, specifically for these concertos, and an explanation as to why the musicians made many of the choices they did, with regard to pitch and the limitations of the instruments that were available to Bach in 1720 or thereabouts.  But this recording is more than the sum of its parts.  These Brandenburgs are the result of an alchemy that defies explanation.  Somewhere I read that John Butt, the director of this ensemble, said at one time (I paraphrase) that he would never want to record a performance of this music that was indistinguishable from every other recording out there.  Well he certainly has avoided that common pitfall.  These are exciting, confident, clear and above all, celestially fresh renditions of music that I really thought I had heard, more or less, enough.  This false assumption made it all the more gratifying to hear these breathtakingly intelligent and beautifully realized recordings for the first time (and second and third, etc.).<br /><br />The recorded sound:  I do not have a terribly sophisticated playback system.  I live in a small apartment in New York City and couldn't exploit a high quality system, even if I had one.  It will be noted that the CDs in this set are labeled \\"Hybrid Super Audio CD\\" and \\"DSD\\".  I have at least 3 other CDs of this nature.  I almost didn't give this CD a chance because my experiences with the other SACDs that I own has been less than ideal.  And sure enough, when I inserted disc 1, I initially thought I wasn't going to like these discs either.  I think it was the sound of the baroque (unvalved) horn on Concerto Nos. 1 & 2.  It's not an ugly sound.  Looking back, I'd say I was more startled by it than anything else, but, this combined with my prior experiences with SACD and the fact that No. 1 is my least favorite of the 6 concertos, made me think, initially, that I wasn't going to like this recording.  Fortunately I gave it another chance.  This time, I started with Concerto number 6 on disc 2.  Number 6 is my favorite anyway because of its unusual dark timbre due to the assignment of the top lines to lower-voiced string instruments (violas and such).  As soon as the music started playing, I felt a feeling in the pit of my stomach that I haven't felt for a long time.  It was the physical manifestation of pure joy at hearing something NEW and yet strangely (perhaps not that strangely) familiar.  It was the pure joy of being taken by surprise.  This is the greatest feeling I know of as a music lover.  This was almost as much to do with the clarity and precision of the sound engineering as to the ingenuity of the music making, even played through my decent, but not exceptional stereo equipment.<br /><br />In short, this set has my highest recommendation.experiences with the other SACDs that I own has been less than ideal.

B0089LOG02|5.0|Excellent story and writing!  Historical fiction.  A mix of Ireland, Minnesota, and Maine.  A story of two &#34;orphans&#34; - Vivian in the 1920's was put on the Orphan Train to the midwest when she lost her whole family in a fire in New York.  Vivian's story and Molly - present day - Molly is 17 and is aging out of the foster care system. Molly goes to work for Vivian in Maine (present day) and they become friends.<br /><br />I'd never heard about the orphan trains that brought thousands of homeless children to the midwest to find them homes, and these homes were not always the best circumstances for these children.<br /><br />I couldn't put the book down so obviously it was a fast read.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Good product and delivery, but I give it 4 stars b/c the story line is too much shoot em up.  And it doesn't reflect the original character story line.  And the ship under water?  Really?
B000089RV6|5.0|This is quite frankly the best Rock and Roll album AC / DC every recorded. It has been reintroduced to the public with the release of Marvel's Ironman movies and it holds up well as in your face music that is great for getting your motor started.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Loved it. Was sad with the ending though. Didn't want it to end that way. But it didn't detract from the adventure.
B00008WT5E|4.0|This album is a good example of AC / DC earlier work when Bon was singing lead. Good raw rock at a slower yet more powerful rythm than the 80's pop rock of other groups that soon followed.
B00280LYIM|4.0|Would recommend this for anyone who likes mixing history with fiction and adventure .  These books Make for a great escape from the stuff that can pull down anyone's day.<br />Fast read good detail.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I haven't gotten unlimited or unmasked, so I was hoping this game  would give me my scribblenauts fix. This game disappointed me. The puzzles are extremely easy, so I'm buzzing through the worlds. And to make that worse, You have to pay for almost everything. If you want to just play around, this game is pretty good. If you're looking for console-like gameplay, that's not what you're getting.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Good series. Didn't want it to end. Obviously I love the books more but the movies are great. Hunger games whaaaaa?!?!
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Vince Gill has one of the best voices in country music and the songs are all wonderful to listen too and they tell storys. You must have this if you love country music.
B00DIJQAI6|5.0|My 5 year old son absolutely loves this game. He can't wait to finish his homework in the afternoons so that he can play it. Graphics are good on the Kindle fire HD and he really likes the gyroscope feature that let's him steer by turning the device. Plenty of characters to choose from and it keeps him challenged.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I just got these for my birthday. I did buy the replacement ear pads as suggested in another review and even after using them so short a time, that made ALL the difference with these. The pleater ear pads are hot and uncomfortable while the cloth one breathe and feel much lighter on my head.<br />Aside from that I am really amazed at the sound. I can use them both on my PC for movies/gaming or plug them into my iPhone for around the house. Yeah, there is a lot of cord, but that's to be expected from a pro set of phones like these. But the depth of the sound is the real stand out here. For a pair of headphones under $100, these deliver every note. My music, movies and games have never sounded better.<br /><br />As a side note, I used these a lot to block noise from neighborhood dogs. When they are on my head and I am into whatever is playing, I don't hear ANYTHING outside. No annoying Noise Canceling hiss either! These are just quality headphones that don't let a lot of outside noise in. There is a little bleed to them, so if you are using them on a plane or mass transit, you might want to be aware of it. People sitting next to you CAN hear. But again, that's not an issue for my use of them.<br /><br />These are my new best friend and I am glad I read the other reviews and got the replacement ear pads. But I am not disappointed in these even a little bit.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|great graphics and awesome guns to choose from. i like it alot and will continue to play it. thanks for putting this game on kindlenfire.

B004JHYRDQ|5.0|Absolutely fabulous! Asimov is one of my favourite authors - I think I have just about every Sci Fi book he wrote. Age has not wearied this book... it's as good a read today as it was when I first read it (gasp!) over 40 years ago!

B00CKZX0AA|5.0|I am a huge Zimmer fan, and this is his best album in some time. The way he mixes rhythmic, pounding percussion with smooth, somber vocals, and the welcome drumset rift... It all fits. My only gripe, and a minor one, is that the songs are not arranged chronologically, which bugs me. That aside, I can happily attest that not one song feels boring or out of place. What you have here is one of Hans' most energetic, dramatic scores. It is not meant to replace John Williams' beloved soundtrack; instead it is meant to provide a new soul for a new generation of Superman.
B00CTNUMPO|4.0|Disney Studios 27th full length animated feature film. Oliver and Company is a decent entry in the Disney animated film cannon with a return to the musical format that made the early films so memorable, Disney continues with their great animation and ground breaking achievements although the period from 1961 to 1989 are not my personal favorite years. I stopped watching Disney animated films around the time The Fox and the Hound came out so I am not all that familiar with the films from that period until The Little Mermaid. Ever since Disney had started the Xerography process with 101 Dalmatians their films while still excellent quality, they just didn't have the Disney luster from the early years. The new films have a much more flat look to me and it just doesn't thrill me the way the earlier films did.<br /><br />The film itself is one of the most different films up to this point, with contemporary music artist in lead roles and singing their songs. The music is quite good and there a some snappy songs. It's not my favorite Disney animated film, but it's a worthy addition to the continuing evolution of Disney's animated film library.<br /><br />OK, now about the film and video releases. I own the original DVD release and the new Blu Ray and the Blu Ray is a very pleasing upgrade with much richer colors and it looks just about perfect.  The film was released 1:66:1 on the first two DVD releases, but the new Blu Ray is 1:85:1, which is probably the true ratio.  I'm happy to be past the years where the aspect ratio was such a problem on these home video releases(1961-1981). These films should have been released with multiple formats included on each edition.<br /><br />The extras are thin and there isn't anything new worth mentioning, but at least there is a very short 'making of' featurette ( a little over 5 minutes) which I think every one of these films should have gotten. There is room for more on this release, but the film looks great and there are some interesting tid bits here.<br /><br />If you must own Disney's Oliver and Company the Blu Ray is the way to go. The film looks great and I doubt will see any substanial bonus material on fiture releases.ing tid bits here.<br /><br />If you must own Disney's Oliver and Company the Blu Ray is the way to go.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is a fun and innovative game. The app connects to your Facebook account and is rarely ever dysfunctional. I have not encountered a problem with the app yet although the game is very addicting and time consuming.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|It wont let me download it which really stinks. Its probably good though- and I wish I could find an app that is for the kindlefire like this.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Highly recommend this book.  Well developed story with several twists and turns that keep the pace brisk.  Hard to put it down
B002QS5OQ4|5.0|I wish this had continued beyond Season 2.  I still watch this from time to time and see new things almost every time that I watch it.
B008ODZNLG|5.0|Very Interesting story of a hard working man and his obsession with creating great food. His focus on making something incredible leaves little room for anything else.
B003MC5L9S|4.0|This book should be a must read for everybody. So inspiring... It is incredible to know how much effort is made just to make us diverge from our main purpose; the elevation of one's self. That's the only freedom, that's the only truth.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Outstanding story of a distopian future. This is the first of three parts and it shows you what life is like in the silos, their rules, and what happens when people start questioning those rules. This entire set of 5, I guess you could call them novellas, interweave a story that held my attention and I wanted to continue reading to see what was going to happen with the characters. As I mentioned this is the first part of the story and the series continues with the three shift episodes and the Saga comes to a conclusion with Dust. I would highly recommend reading all of them and can't see how if you start reading this one you would not be driven to seek out the rest of the story. Great writing, good character development, and a fabulous world that the writer has developed here.
B00G6ZTM3Y|4.0|Everything about this game is good, except for the fact I get a headache after 5 minutes of playing. This may be just me.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Excellent Bond film and nice to see that it is back to basics. Not so much about the toys but about the man with his strengths and weaknesses. It made me want to continue seeing Bond movies as long as they continue down this new path. Daniel Craig has done an outstanding job so far playing Bond.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is a must play. it s almost like the Pc edition but with more updates ,by the way if anyone wants to invite me,my username is crafter101354.
B0013F1D02|5.0|You can enjoy the visuals, the stunts, and the scenery-- both people and surroundings:  magnificent.  The acting is first class, and some of the conceits like the dead princes watching everything are funny and clever.  But the fifth star is for all the tiny details that only a movie buff would like.  Quick, what was the name of the inn where Yvaine and Dunstun consummated their love? If you watch this movie over again, you will find other things to tickle your funny bone.  Someone compared it to the Princess Bride;  IMO the PB script was better but the Stardust production v values are tops.  top flight
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|It's Jane Austen... what more needs to be said?! I mean if you love one you will more than likely love the rest. But this is a story of lost and found love. What could be better.
B007SNG6IC|5.0|Most moving film I've seen in years.  Despite the backdrop, this is NOT a disaster film.  It's a celebration of the senses, of love, and the resilience of the human spirit.  Poetry on screen with a hot and believable love story.  The writing and direction create a mood that's still left me feeling happy and grateful days later.<br /><br />Also, funny in the way ordinary people can be.  Don't miss this

B00FN3HRG4|5.0|I was lucky enough to attend this concert in Toronto on October 23, 2012.  It was a night I will never forget!!! Barbra was outstanding and her performance was amazing.  She, at 70, still has the ability to maintain the best way to sing a song.  She was in the moment on each song and was singing to a SOLD OUT crowd at the ACC Arena in Toronto and it was if she was singing to you individually.<br /><br />I will never forget the opening where she sings the whole record of &#34;You'll Never Know&#34; with film clips of her childhood playing on big screens.  As the song ended the camera panned across the bridge to Brooklyn and the &#34;Funny Girl&#34; overture began.  On the screens was everything that was going on while she was on Broadway in &#34;Funny Girl.&#34;  The audience was going wild.  When the overture ended Barbra came up from below the stage and got a 5 minute standing ovation.  That night she opened the show with &#34;Being Good isn't Good Enough.&#34;  The audience went crazy.  In Brooklyn she opened with, &#34;As if We Never Said Goodbye,<br />with lyrics tailor made for Brooklyn.  It was spectacular on the DVD and CD  also in the Brooklyn concert she sang, &#34;Being Good isn't Good Enough&#34; later in the show.<br /><br />This DVD/CD is a testament that talent stands the test of time.  Barbra at 70 can still take you on a musical journey with each song.  She bends notes, wraps notes, goes high and belts when needed.  The tribute to the late Marvin Hamlisch is astounding and has Barbra singing the &#34;Way We Were&#34; in the film arrangement, which in my opinion was always the better one then she dedicates another classic to him that he wrote about their friendship, &#34;Through the Eyes of Love.&#34;  then she ends with the &#34;Way we Were.&#34;  All the while there are pictures and film on a screen of the two of them over the years...not a dry eye in the house.<br /><br />Each song is a revelation from the Bergmans medley of That Face/Nice and Easyto the act I finale of a Jule Styne Medley that includes 2 masterpieces from &#34;Gypsy&#34; and &#34;Funny Girl.&#34;  She starts off with &#34;Roses Turn&#34; goes into &#34;Some People&#34; then right into &#34;Don't Rain on My Parade.  This was the Act I finale and the audience went wild.  Some other gems in act I are:  &#34;Didn't WE,&#34;<br />&#34;Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered.&#34;  Each song is done with perfect phrasing and in the moment Barbra is still the ultimate artist by far.<br /><br />Act II begins with &#34;Your the Top&#34; which she sang over the credits in &#34;What's up Doc&#34;  yet she changes all the lyrics to fit Brooklyn.  Barbra sings this complicated song in a breezy manner and really has fun with it again the audience goes wild.  Next she brings on Chris Botti who accompanies her on 3 songs one is a duet:  &#34;My Funny Valentine/What'll I Do, then they banter a bit and then he accompanies her on &#34;Lost inside of you&#34; this is amazing as Barbra goes up to her high soprano range and blows the audience away.  The last song is, &#34;Evergreen&#34;  she does it as beautiful as ever.  Chris Botti's Trumpet playing just adds an extra layer of beauty to the already beautiful voice...he enhances Barbra.  Then she sings &#34;People&#34; in the style of the original 1964 release which is breathtaking.<br /><br />The Finale is &#34;Make our Garden Grow&#34; complete with a choir and her special guest stars for the evening, Il volvo.  In act one she did a duet of &#34;Smile with them that was seamless.  On &#34;Make our Garden Grow&#34; she duets with il volvo and the choir in the background...it is a showstopper.  The audience goes wild.  She also does a poignant &#34;Here's to Life&#34; and comes back for 2 encores &#34;Some other Time&#34;  which again, like &#34;Make our Garden Grow&#34; is by Leonard Bernstein.  She closes out with &#34;Happy Days are Here again with the audience singing with her.<br /><br />It is so great to see atalent like Barbra Streisand really singing complex material and connecting with the audience on each song.  If only the young talent of today could learn a thing or two from this once in a lifetime legend the world would be a better place musically.  Barbra gives all her being over to each song and it shows by the response she gets from the audience.  While she is singing, everyone is so enraptured you could hear a pin drop.  Yet in between songs people are going wild telling Barbra how much they love her and how fabulous she is.  She even has an ask Barbra segment where audience members fill out cards before the show and she reads the questions and answers the questions with great wit, charm and comedic timing.  This is what show business is all about.  I recommend you buy this CD/DVD immediately while it is still on sale this week as I am sure the price will rise in a week or 2.  The cd/DVD also comes with a great picture book and is worth every penny.  Barbra you truly are &#34;The greatest Star&#34;

B005LN5UOC|4.0|I have owned and reviewed quite a few headsets. I really didn't expect much from one in this price range, but was pleasantly surprised. I like the way it fits in your ear, and the sound is great. The only negative was that unless I had the mic very close to my mouth there were times I couldn't be heard. That could just be me, or it could be this one unit. Overall, for the price, you can't beat it!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|AS always, Stephen King has written a book that will keep you up all night reading, unable to stop had to find out what would happen next!<br />Was in the dark as way it was called &#34;Dr.Sleep&#34;,then wow it was a perfect name, the child and her family in the story was a great way to come full circle with his life.<br />If you have not readed &#34;The Shining&#34; in a long time,you might re-read it and then go straight to &#34;DR. Sleep&#34;,as I did,found it helped with the enjoyment of reading.<br />Lots of twist and turns, with some humor.<br />  Thank you Mr. King for a great reading vacation on the beach in Luquillo,PR

B005MLOKXA|5.0|It is pure addiction for me now with this series.  There are some slow subtopics in the series that make me a little crazy but that is what keeps me interested.  Love every character, great that the secondary characters are being focused on more and built out with this season.  I love watching this on demand with amazon prime!

B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great alarm clock! It's nice having as many different alarm times and days as I want. Plus each can have their own sounds. I think my favorite part is that each can be labeled with whatever I choose.  So if Saturday morning comes & I can't remember why I have to be up so early, my alarm reminds me that my son has music lessons at 8 AM.

B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Overall, it's a very good game. My brother convinced me to buy it, and  I just love it! There is one question I have, can the kindle support multiplayer? I tried connecting to my brother but nothing happens. If you know how to connect servers, please tell me.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Fun game, works well most of the time. Not five stars because it glitches from time to time and you don't get things.

0307719219|5.0|I had to read this book for class, but this is one of the times where I did not regret having to pay for a schoolbook because I actually enjoyed it immensely! Acemoglu and Robinson write a book that does not read like an academic book but more a story of true events, and it is a truly eye-opening book about poverty around the world. It made me feel more grateful for all we have. Great and inspirational read!
0385537131|5.0|Interesting and a good read.  A good profile of the feelings in the south. Keeps you in suspense till the end.  Always enjoy Mr. Grisham's writing.
0670022950|5.0|I wanted to rate this book four stars because it is the most dense book I have ever read in college and it has miniscule print that is difficult to read, making for a very long read. That being said the research and analysis Pinker puts into this book is astounding, hence the 5 stars!! There are amazing facts in here that I never knew about the history of violence and its surprising (to me) decline. He goed all the way back to biblical times and finished in present day. Some accounts are so gruesome they will make you cringe when you read them and see the illustration but it is fascinating!! If you have a lot of time on your hands to devote to this book go for it you will enjoy it, but dont plan on it being a quick read.
1476727651|5.0|Danny Torrance battled the demons of the Overlook Hotel as a child and the demons of alcoholism as an adult.  He is trying to turn his life around and has pretty much tampered down his gift of the Shining when young Abra Stone gets in touch with him.  Abra also has the gift of the Shining - much more so than Dan ever did.  Unfortunately, she's attracted the attention of the True Knot a group of vampire-like beings who need her for her “steam”.  Soon Abra and Dan unite to fight the True Knot and Dan will finally face all of his demons.<br /><br />In his long career Stephen King has created characters that linger in readers minds long after they've finished reading the book and young Danny Torrance from “The Shining” is certainly one of them.  At the end of “The Shining” there was a faint bit of hope that Danny would turn out okay; at the beginning of “Doctor Sleep” it is unfortunately clear that Dan has followed in dear old dad's footsteps.  Unlike Jack Torrance, whom I root for every time I reread The Shining (hoping that somehow this time he'll find a way past the demons that haunt him), Danny is not a particularly likable character at the beginning of “Doctor Sleep”.  King took a big chance with Danny's character but slowly redeemed him throughout the course of the book until I was finally rooting for him as much as I did his father.  Abra is a nicely done character and shows King at his best - her Shining is powerfully strong and, while unbelievable in real-life, King manages to make readers believe there really could be someone out there with her abilities.  Her connection with Dan is wonderfully done with a twist I really should have seen coming but didn't.  As for the True Knot, while they did have some creepy and horrifying moments, they weren't as creepy as some of King's earlier villains.  King does have some nifty tricks up his sleeve regarding them but he has mellowed in his old age and I can't help but think there would have been more bloodshed among the good guys if he had written “Doctor Sleep” when he was younger.<br /><br />If I had to compare the two books, I'd have to say “The Shining” is the better of the two simply because it is scarier even after repeated readings (hedge animals anyone?). However, “Doctor Sleep” is a worthy sequel and Dan and Abra still linger in my mind even though I finished reading the book.bloodshed among the good guys if he had written “Doctor Sleep” when he was younger.<br /><br />If I had to compare the two books, I'd have to say “The Shining” is the better of the two simply because it is scarier even after repeated readings (hedge animals anyone?).

B00EEDNA4M|5.0|I love this set! I am a huge Breaking Bad fan. I recently order this set @ the Barnes and Noble final premiere signing. Amazing experience. I was able to watch to documentary for the first time with the cast and crew of the show. The documentary alone is worth it since you can only find when you buy this set. After the show we were able to meet the cast from the show and have them sign the complete set. I couldn't have wished for a better christmas gift. A+++<br />GO BUY THIS SET FOR YOUR LOVED ONES !!!!!!
B009LGO88E|3.0|This item is honestly good, it really is. It does what it's supposed to do, it gives you access to another anolog stick, for moving the camera in some games, and extra shoulder buttons. It's a great accessory, only problem is that there's not enough games that support it. The only ones I can think of off the top of my head are Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop DIstance, which really brings out the console like aspect of it, Resident Evil Revelations, which I have never played, and Kid Icarus which only make it easier for left handed people to play as it doesn't make it possible to aim the camera with the second stick. It's a great item, but sadly not enough games support it. Because of the limited number of games that work with this I gave it a 3, if more games are added to the list then I might increase my rating.
B00475AYJQ|2.0|Too long. The story is good, but it is more detail than necessary and just becomes a rambling bore x
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The Good Wife has a great storyline, great acting, interesting interchanges between the characters and each episode is interesting and thought provoking.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Awesome game. Great graphics. Great time killer. Way better than Hunger Games and I haven't had any problems at all.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I love this game, however I really wish the kindle game would catch up with the other systems. I have completed several levels on other devices that are not yet available on here. When they become available I will gladly give 5 stars.
0804161380|4.0|In recent memory, strategy guides have become less of a necessity and more of a collector's item.  For every game nowadays there is a guide to accompany it.  Sometimes there's a collector's edition guide as well.  For collector's these are sometimes a lot of fun.  For Zelda fans that enjoy Zelda lore this collection is a fantastic buy.  There is a limited number in print and it's simply amazing to behold.  It's great packaging and actually has things in there specifically for collectors.<br /><br />Before I begin I want to stress that this review won't be going into the content of each guide.  With the exception of the Skyward Sword guide, each of these guides is exactly the same as their standard (and separately released) collector's edition counterpart.  The reason Skyward Sword is not the same is because this copy was revised and expanded upon.  Aside from that, the other five guides are largely unchanged from their original releases.  There are subtle differences but nothing that greatly changes the actual content in the guide.<br /><br />To begin, the guides come packaged in a box that looks like a chest.  When you open it up there are six hardbound guides in there.  The covers all look very similar.  Each one having an embossed Hyrule symbol on them.  The covers and the borders are different on each guide.  The six guides included are for Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, Ocarina of Time 3D, Skyward Sword and the Windwaker HD.  All the guides have gold leaf pages that are shiny when looking at them from the side.<br /><br />There are a couple of things to note about the guides themselves.  The first is that it seems just a little strange that the guides themselves are not actually individually shrink wrapped.  This seems a little odd.  It's not that big of a deal but when you open the packaging they're already loose.  Considering each original release came shrink wrapped it's a little strange.  Perhaps the thing that some consumers might mind is that none of these guides come with their respective extras.  Anything that was considered a bonus for getting the collector's edition guide isn't here.  Likewise, when this particular collection was announced, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds simply wasn't planned for the package.  So anyone hoping this guide comes with the collection are out of luck.  That's no big deal.<br /><br />There are also a couple of things to note here about only a couple of guides.  The first and most obvious is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  Prima NEVER actually released a hardcover edition of this guide.  Ever.  This is the first time that Ocarina of Time 3D players will get to grab this guide in hardcover.  Originally the guide was only in paperback.  This makes the collector's value certainly worthwhile as it means that the guide will have much more limited hardcover run than all the other guides here.  This boxset is more or less your only chance to get it.<br /><br />The second thing of note is that the Skyward Sword guide included here is NOT the same as the one originally published.  It has been revised and expanded.  Even the layout is very different from the original guide itself.  It has been revised and expanded by over 100 pages.  It is almost a completely new guide from the original one that was released.  So yes, this one too is a rarity because you won't have much luck finding it outside of this particular box set.<br /><br />There are a couple of subtle differences between some guides and the originals.  Most notably is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  The original guide was around 224 pages and written in three columns.  Here it's 288 pages and is written in two columns.  It's a lot easier to read and a lot cleaner as a result.  Much of the text isn't so cramped.  Some moments in the Ocarina of Time 3D guide pop out a lot easier.  It just looks better and more organized overall.  The Legendary Checklist in the Ocarina of Time Guide is also better looking.The tables are easier to read and easier on the eyes.  Likewise, the Legendary Checklist in the Twilight Princess Guide is A LOT easier to read and A LOT less cramped.  In the original guide the entire checklist was on a single page with just the location.  Here it's expanded to be in a table format, the font is bigger and it now lets you know your first chance to complete it as well as telling you what's required.  The Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks guides are virtually unchanged from their initial releases.  The Windwaker HD is pretty much the same as well.  So for those wondering about whether or not they've changed some things from the original guides, the answer is yes.  Quite simply put some of them are a tad easier to read.<br /><br />The set also came with a few bonuses of note.  The first and probably most valuable of all, is that you get a certificate of authentication from Eijo Aonuma that is signed and numbered.  The second is a laser etched metallic bookmark.  For collectors this package is a pretty sweet deal.  It's invaluable.  The only thing I wish we could've gotten would have been to actually get all the extras the guides themselves actually came with.  It is more or less the only thing I feel is missing and keeping it from being a complete package.  Part of what made the guides collector's editions aside from the hardcovers was actually getting little bonuses that didn't come with the guide otherwise.<br /><br />Nevertheless, for the fan of Zelda this is a good buy.  But let's be clear.  If you are buying this, chances are it is probably not to actually utilize the guides themselves.  After all, many of the games these guides are for have been out for a while and, truthfully, you could just buy them on their own if you really wanted them for strategy.  They are a collector's item.  And it is certainly a nice one.The tables are easier to read and easier on the eyes.

B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I play this on Facebook and it is a lot of fun. It is a lot different, but still fun. I like the story.
B00FDSUJ0A|5.0|It's a very cohesive album. The music is catchy with a 80s electronic vibe. Highly recommended (although I'm side eyeing amazon placing this on sale within two months of the original release date).
1587613379|5.0|Excited to get this book. Have not finished reading it, but it seems to be a book that I think everyone should really read. You might not be able to apply some of the concepts to your own life, some of the concepts might not be for you. But I think that they are concepts people need to open their minds to. Happy with my purchase and it arrived so fast!
B009LXECF6|4.0|It is a good album. No doubt about that that. Especially with great songs like &#34;Young Girls&#34;, &#34;When I Was Your Man&#34;, and &#34;Treasure&#34;. But songs like &#34;Gorilla&#34; brought this rating down one star. That's not bad though. Bruno still made a fun album full of great melodies and songs that will have people on the dance floor for years to come. Recommended. Clean version is extremely recommended highly!
B00BAXFECK|2.0|The author never met an adjective she didn't like. Reading this was like wading through rainbow colored cotton candy only to get to the hollow paper core. An editor would have been a blessing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its a great game love it so much challanging but fun. though addictive but definitely wot every second just cant resist it. u love it
B004EPYZP8|4.0|This movie perfectly meets the requirements of the genre, and the only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that the genre itself -- slick, plot-driven, &#34;sting&#34; movie -- is a pretty easy thing to do and doesn't really stretch the actors all that much.  I enjoyed the novel on which this movie was based, and now, about 4 years later, I've gotten round to the movie.  It does justice to the tone, spirit and much of the detail of the movie.  The cast is absolutely up to the job -- McConaughy, Marisa Tomei, William H. Macy, Ryan Philippe, and, in a small role, Bryan Cranston -- all are fine, as are the less well-known supporters.  If I had to pick one out, I would say that Macy brings something -- maybe just his look -- that you remember in a quite small role that is nonetheless important to the plot.  Pacing, camera work, music -- all apt.  So if you like plots that have more twists than a corkscrew and haven't seen this one, it won't disappoint you.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|i think this game is fun though why cant i get it to work without internet i would recommend this game
0385351399|4.0|Well.  I was a little doubtful that I wanted to read this based on the synopsis, but I knew I was going to check it out just because it was Eggers.  While [[ASIN:0375725784 A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius]] is one of my favorite books and I thought [[ASIN:1400095565 How We Are Hungry]], [[ASIN:1400033543 You Shall Know Our Velocity]], and [[ASIN:0307385906 What is the What]] were all excellent personal stories, [[ASIN:B00E31Z50M A Hologram for the King 1st (first) Edition by Eggers, Dave published by McSweeney's (2012)]] felt a little perfunctory.  I enjoyed this book a little more than Hologram, but it still felt more like that book than the others which I definitely enjoyed more.<br /><br />It was incredibly easy to become fully immersed in this story; it was a quick pleasurable read, but I still felt like there was a lack of personal connection.  I mostly just felt angry as the story progressed as I wanted to grab Mae and shake her after just about every decision she made.  The fictional future detailed here seems like such an easy extension of everything that is going on today, and that direction is wholly frightening to me.  I couldn't tell whether the author was ever making a true attempt at convincing me that what was going on in The Circle was actually beneficial or if I was *supposed* to be angry about it all.  A lot of time was spent explaining what was going on and how amazing everything was, but I just hated the company and their goals from, basically, page 1, so I was never quite exactly how to navigate my feelings toward Mae or The Circle.  The ending, I think, did finally vindicate my feelings and did kind of vindicate my feelings that this was to serve as a warning about, not only technology, but also the ever-present pitfall of \\"power corrupts.\\"<br /><br />If only we all understood, \\"mistakes are made by all and that they should, if everyone is acknowledging our common humanity, our common frailty and propensity for sounding and looking ridiculous a thousand times a day, that these mistakes should be allowed to be forgotten\\" then perhaps the cold face of technology and the race for knowledge could retain some humanity.  This, of course, was diametrically opposed to the goals of The Circle.  Both Mae and Francis were quickly and completely subsumed by the allure of the power of total knowledge, and this compassionate approach to the flawed nature of all of us was buried by the inevitable march forward.  Is there a tipping point it is no longer \\"enough to be aware of the millions of permutations possible\\" such they we are no longer able to \\"take comfort in knowing [we will] not, and really [can] not, know much at all?\\"  Once tasted, will our thirst for knowledge ever fully be sated?<br /><br />Only Mercer remained the voice of reason throughout the novel.  It was, again, ambiguous to me whether the author really wanted me to see him as an antagonist as I found it impossible not to root for him the whole time.  The fear I have of falling too far of the technological cliff was made real in Mercer's thoughts.  I wish we all had someone to let us know \\"how incredibly boring [we've] become\\" when we start believing that simply \\"comment[ing] on things... substitutes for doing them.\\"  I do not want to find myself in a world where \\"look[ing] at pictures of Nepal, push[ing] a smile button, and think[ing] that's the same as actually going there\\" is the norm.  Echoing one of the themes I appreciated from [[ASIN:0375413928 The Idiot (Everyman's Library)]], Bailey did note that, \\"the individual act has reverberations that can be nearly endless,\\" which made me happy to see.  Contrary to Ippolit's thoughts regarding our inability to know the effects of everything we do and the beauty in that, however, Bailey's drive is to remove that uncertainty from our lives.  I understand the attraction of wanting to know... if we are to believe Daniel Quinn's assertions from the [[ASIN:0553375407 Ishmael: An Adventure of the Mindand Spirit]] series, it is an innate human desire to KNOW and, in that knowledge gain control.  This makes so much sense, but it never seems to end well, and I simply cannot acquiesce to the demands of this march when there is so much beauty in uncertainty to lose.  It may be true that \\"all things are naked and opened to the eyes of God,\\" but I don't want the \\"eyes of God.\\"  I certainly don't want you to have them.<br /><br />I want to choose the people with whom I share myself, and I'd like to think that someone would want to choose me for the same.  Mae could not have been more wrong in her considerations of pain and suffering.  Misery may love company, but, again, I want to choose that company.  It may be true that \\"suffering is only suffering if it's done in silence, in solitude,\\" but \\"pain experienced in public, in view of loving millions\\" is not \\"communion.\\"  That is hell.  I don't want to suffer silently or alone - especially when someone else is involved with whatever pain may exist - but I want to share that with the person that matters.  Not with the world.  This world may prevent my inevitable solitude on one level, but I'd rather that than find myself alone in a crowd or just one of millions of voices begging to be heard by the whole of humanity.  I want the \\"communion,\\" but I cannot believe that exists on a worldwide scale.  I am not sure why the community that we are currently building scares me so much more than Heinlein's from [[ASIN:0441788386 Stranger in a Strange Land]], but it does.  I am frightened, and I long for shared experiences that exist outside of like buttons and shared status updates.  Perhaps that was the point all along.<br /><br />The irony of writing these words with the intent of posting them in a public forum is not lost on me... It is still exciting to see my review helped someone on Amazon or someone commented on my post on Goodreads, etc, etc, etc...  I just hope that I... that we... do not all become so caught up in our digital lives and our attempts to be heard by a large number of people that I... that we... lose sight of the importance of having our voice heard by one who may truly understand what I am saying, why I am saying it, and what it truly means.  In a personal context.<br /><br />Writing this review has changed my mind a bit on this book... Initially it was a 3-star read for me, but after reflection I raised it to 4.  Anything that can make me think and feel about real life as much as this did is certainly better than average.and Spirit]] series, it is an innate human desire to KNOW and, in that knowledge gain control.

B00000F6LQ|5.0|Can't help it.  One is either  a Monty Python fan or not.  Have at one time or another memorized several scenes/monologues<br />from this film.  There's no use saying anything good or bad about the movie.  Like I said you either like Monty Python or not.<br />Thanks.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I have installed, uninstalled and installed and uninstalled this app on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 more than 4 times. Every time I begin to read a book, I can never go &#34;back&#34; to the library in the app. It gets stuck in that same book forever! I tried to troubleshoot this but got nowhere and found no support for this issue. So, I uninstalled it for the last time! I'm done!
B002E01MHY|3.0|Was better than most movies from that time  . But still not that great. Of course not of these ever won a award .
B005PK57NU|5.0|Enjoy stories related to Chicago & Illinois politics and locations.Best are the legal battles and resolutions. Disappointed that the sexual content keeps me from watching with my grandchildren.
B004BLDD9Y|5.0|Works very well in with our living room lighting. Has a nice soft glow and makes reading easy. It will last much longer than the incandescent bulb it replaces. I'll buy another one as soon as the other light in the fixture burns out.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|it was a little confusing and hard to follow. the several story lines in the movie dont tie together very well
B00FEX1AA2|5.0|OMG this poor family, glad they had the Warren's to rely on. I did make a couple jumps & a friend had a hard time falling asleep...she said it scared the daylights out of her & she should have never rented it. I found this quite funny as I was able to sleep just fine. But i did buy it & it was defiantly worth it! Again to Amazon I have to say....Thanks for streaming
B006PZBR8S|1.0|I chose this not because it was a bad movie it's a great movie but the movie keep stopping and starting multiple times throughout the film so it made it hard to watch thanks
B00DUCXFUC|5.0|I'm a sucker for certain types of collectibles, especially when it comes to Batman. This set did not disappoint. The films are classics and the book and figurines are a perk, so I'm happy with the purchase.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|Fun game with great graphics really enjoyed playing  the game, the puzzles are great I have spent many nights solving them
B00ET9T2WK|5.0|Im obsesed with this game I started playing on my friends I pad and I played at least 3 hours and I got indicted to it.
B00C6B9H46|5.0|Great movie and breakout character for Vin Diesel.  Riddick is a great and I hope they do a 4th movie soon.  This particular BD is a good transfer with no issues I have seen.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|This is AB's best work to date. I'm a guitar player and I can say the riffs on this album are inspiring and great to listen to all day at work or while running. I like the heaviness of this album. Myles and Mark are a songwriting duo to be reckoned with. If you like hard rock and guitar based rock, this album is a must. I hope AB continues in this direction.
B00F2362IE|5.0|This game is awesome, one of my favorite apps. I love to use Mikey. Also great for kids!  Go Teeanage Mutant Ninja Turtles!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I read the book and this is one of the movies that followed the book very well. I recommend this book.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|Fun app that gets pretty hard in the upper levels. Great graphics and cute characters.  No malware that I could detect. Fun and well worth the 99 cents!
B008O9V4C2|4.0|Takes some getting use to, but it's more high quality music from Fagen..and who is mystery drummer that no one's ever heard of, Earl Cooke?<br />I know, but I can't tell you.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Got this for my granddaughter to play on my Kindle. She enjoys playing it when she visits. There is also a dance page she loves.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Its a really great show if you love the Terminator universe, it just sucks that it got cancelled, I hope they bring it back.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was a book that my mom got mad at me for because I would not put it down. Positively amazing
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This game is the best. It allows you to play all sorts of songs without knowing them. It is what I have been wanting. A dream come true!
B008JFUPOY|5.0|Family Movie Night was a huge hit for our house with Monster's University.<br /><br />I typically find prequels to not be nearly as good as original movies, however I felt this was just as good if not slightly better than Monster's Inc (and Monster's Inc is my favorite Pixar film)!
B00CH3WMUO|5.0|We order one of these calendars every year as we have a cat, and these photos are so delightful and so &#34;cat.&#34;  Last year, I purchased a different calendar for my husband, and we both regretted not seeing a new cat every day.  The qualities of these photos and the unique locations and cat expressions make this my favorite calendar ever.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Kids loved it.  It has a lot of action, no gore or sex.  maybe a little too cheesy - i would recommend it.
B00FXMGI0G|3.0|Good but way over the top compared to the first one.  Great to see the same cast back together again
B000OVLINI|5.0|Absolutely fantastic book. The story and characters were well developed and I couldn't have asked for better twists and turns throughout. Highly recommend.
B00C7607BC|1.0|The digital copy information was not included in the video. Very frustrating, especially since we paid so much for it.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Robert Jordan and family. Thank you very much. I have read fantasy books since I was a kid. Starting with The Drizzt series from R.A. To actually Mr Sanderson who wrote this last book. This series was amazing from beginning to end. The depth and growth of the characters was immense and addicting. I know that after Mr. Jordan passed that a big whole was left to fill. I would like to say Mr. Sanderson did a excellent job. There was no way to truly mimick his writing, but you did incredible. It was truly a great wrap up. I have never read a book series so truly intertwined. To write the last battle and include all characters mentioned was truly excellent. Thank you for the excellent mental adventure.<br />-Joe H.-
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Lots of fun.  Quick to play.  I think I would have liked it to last a little longer.  I wasn't ready to stop playing so I had to start it again as soon as I finished.  It was more in the realm of mind candy in that it didn't provide a lot of challenge.  But one doesn't always require challenge to enjoy a game.  The graphics are good as is the story line.  I had fun!<br />.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is so much better than Facebook's! You don't have energy and you can harvest ponds and trees as much as you want. And unlike Facebook, it's not time demanding. I recommend this to anyone who has played the Facebook castle Ville.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|This blu-ray disk has stunning high def imagery, but have not had time to sit through the whole thing yet.
B0000060NH|5.0|The same as with Otis I love marvin Gaye and I loved the movie Four brothers. I'm from Detroit and motown is in my soul. The instrementals are amazing also.
B005DNOAQY|5.0|If you've ever felt awkward around women you're interested in this is a film that will make you feel better about it.  I've loved this film since I was 12! (and awkward  around women I was interested in.  I has dozens of quotable lines of dialog including my favorite, &#34;If they're beautiful their crazy.  Great beauty drives a woman crazy.&#34;  (Sorry gals, it just *seems* so true at times.)  Watching  &#34;Humphrey Bogart&#34; giving Woody Allen dating advice is comedic excellence.  Truly classic.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Why not use a real Komodo Dragon? I haven't seen special effects so poor since they were drawn onto the screen in the 80s.
B00ELD3MUW|1.0|Outlook gave me a security warning so I removed this from my Kindle. I don't understand. Maybe it was not compatible?
B005DJREJS|5.0|I wasn't sure how this show would be seeing as pretty much everything from MTV sucks now a day, But this show didn't disappoint me. Right from the start it drew me in and made me want to keep watching, the more you watch the more you feel like the characters are actually becoming your friends as well. Not to mention Jenna (the main character) has a blog, and her writing style has inspired me to actually try and improve my vocabulary. All this from an MTV show.. Now bad. I highly recommend watching.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book was very hard to put down, hence the review title. I really enjoyed the journey the book took me on!  I never read The Shining but even so Stephen King never left me wondering what was going on. Bravo
B00DW1WR14|5.0|The boys are back!!! Best PJ in years. I would compare this CD to Vs. or a more relaxed version of Ten.
B004498KPU|3.0|I bought this DVD video collection and thought I was getting a good deal with all of Michael Jackson videos, but I was wrong. The graphics on this DVD are terrible!!!! Most of the videos are not clear (definitely not in HD) and some does not fit the screen. This DVD made the Michael Jackson videos look pretty cheap and poorly made. I am not too sure who is responsible for getting this release but it is clearly obvious that this was done in a hurry to make some quick money off of MJ. I gave this 3 stars instead of one because I love Michael Jackson and I think he is the best entertainer of all time and I think they should have took the time and effort on this DVD for his fans. I do not recommend anyone to get this DVD video collection.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been playing this game for months and have never gotten tired of it. Try other games that I have liked but I always come back to Candy Crush and those other games?  Are not on my device anymore because I am over them. Candy Crush forever.
B0081336FO|5.0|One of the best shows I have seen in a long time. Looking forward to Season 3 coming out in Jan. 2014.
0062086529|4.0|This was always one of my favorites as a small child. It's a sweet, imaginative story that has stood the test of time. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it arrived warped and with a few small spots peeling. I ordered several board books, all shipped by Amazon, and this was the only one with defects. I decided they weren't bad enough to go through the trouble of returning it. I just hope they're not signs of a poorly made book.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|Another thoughtful, anguished love story by the master romantic Jane Austen! Familiar characters and human follies as any Austen fan will immediately recognize.
0793563836|5.0|Without a doubt the best place to start for a beginner.<br /><br />As a kid I was classically trained on the trumpet, so I have a clear idea of how to learn an instrument, and what I want to learn. However, 25 years after putting down my trumpet I was surprised to realize I had forgotten nearly everything about musical theory. Aside from being new to the bass and string instruments in general, I also needed to relearn how to read sheet music, and how to play the music on a bass guitar. I browsed a few 'how-to' books, but had trouble finding one which truly started from the beginning.<br /><br />'Hal Leonard Bass Method' starts by showing you how to hold the instrument, tune the bass, describes the basics of reading sheet music, how to place your left and right hands and fingers, then moves to very basic playing exercises which stress the fundamentals of understanding notes and timing. The information is clearly laid out, and moves with a logical progression so you are always building on what you learned.  It is also comprehensive enough that once the basics are mastered, there will be plenty of more advanced instruction to keep you busy for years.<br /><br />I have a friend who insisted that I could just pick up the bass and play along to my favorite songs, that too much classical training can stymie a more natural feel for playing fun music. Well, I have yet to decide just where I will take my bass playing, but I know that I want to understand the mechanics of my instrument rather than just make cool sounds on it. Ripping scales may never happen, but if someone hands me some sheet music I want to be able to know what to do with it. If you have similar aspirations, this book is a great place to start.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|A week before this movie was released on dvd, I decided to read the book before buying the movie. I still to this day can not recall ever reading a book as fast as I read The Hunger Games. To describe the book (well I would have to review the book itself). I had my doubts about the movie at the time, but after watching it, I was completely hooked.<br /><br />This story introduces us to Katniss Everdeen(Jennifer Lawrence) and her sister Prim, mom (whose name is not ever revealed). Early on it is made clear that Katniss is really the backbone of the family. And right away it is also clear that life: everyone and everything around her is depressing. To be honest, the town looks and feels like a communist society.<br />With The Reaping coming up, that is-tributes from each district selected at random to participate in the grueling Hunger Games-which is-an olympic like showdown designed so that 24 contestants fight, kill (yes kill) to come out on top. Unfortunately for older tributes, your name is entered multiple times, which obviously makes you more likely to be chosen. While at The Reaping along with Prim and Katniss's friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth), Prim is unexpectedly chosen which makes Katniss volunteer herself in her sister's place. And thus, we are given a movie.<br /><br />There is so much to admire about the movie The Hunger Games. The acting, from Woody Harrelson's sometimes hilarious but serious toned performance as Haymitch to Amanda Stenberg's adorable performance as Rue, is really on point in the movie.The movie does a good job of digging into your emotions as well. There are going to be times in the movie where you will want a certain character to survive and live, of course you will have some characters that you want to die immediately. I hear this complaint all the time about \\"well this should have been in the movie\\" or \\"why was this part in the book but not in the movie?\\" I hear it a lot with my friends and colleagues. Movies like Harry Potter or The Chronicles of Narnia, etc. come to mind as great examples of working around the lengthy pages and being adapted to two hour or more movies. This one really stayed with the book in my opinion. Obviously, there were some things left out, but as for the movie itself, it does stay on par with the book.<br /><br />To close, you can and will expect drama, action, suspense, and many more things with this movie. I definitely can say that the books by Suzanne Collins (I am currently reading Mockingjay) are also definitely worth it. The Hunger Games is not just about the will to survive, it is about Katniss's courage and will to win. Again, The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a fantastic read, and this movie directed by Gary Ross is an exciting watch. I hope I have not set my expectations to high for The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, which I will be seeing this weekend, but I am even more excited to write my review for it since I have been hearing such great things about it. If you have not yet seen this movie, GO WATCH IT. My rating for this movie:<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />Starring: Jennifer Lawrence, Liam Hemsworth, Lenny Kravitz, Josh Hutcherson, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci,ronicles of Narnia, etc. come to mind as great examples of working around the lengthy pages and being adapted to two hour or more movies.

B00000IQW5|5.0|Yet another long time favorite, Always is a funny, exciting, and deeply touching movie that deals with courage and love before and after death. Outstanding performances by Dreyfuss, Hunter, and the always dependable John Goodman make this one a keeper.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Dispicable me is really funny and awesome. It has every thing you could want, age appropriate ,funny , fun child safe and is very entertaining.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Once again, Quentin Tarantino takes a quirky, outrageous, violence-ridden screenplay and makes it work. As usual he gets terrific performances out of his main characters. Brad Pitt is great as the bloodthirsty leader of the Bastards, but it is Waltz who mesmerizes every time he is on screen.
B006FE83UE|1.0|Does not age well. The book is a classic but the film is poorly made. Besides Gregory Peck the acting is amateurish. I disliked the daughter in the movie but in the book she's the narrator
B005LAIIJY|4.0|Who but Tarantino could get away with a movie like this? It has all of the signature violence and gore, outrageous characters, and outrageously fine performances (Samuel L. Jackson and Christoph Waltz are simply amazing). I can fully understand someone giving this film low marks because of the language and vile action sequences. I feel a bit guilty liking it as much as I do. But, as usual, Tarantino takes what could have been a B-rated gory screenplay and turns it into a work of cinematic art. I'm not sure how he keeps getting oscar-level performances from his actors, but he does in film after film.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the best Android keyboard I have tried. Flow works perfectly most of the time, and the word prediction just keeps getting better the longer you use it. I tried a few others, including Swype, and this just seems to be easier to use.
1401322336|5.0|Great book with excellent recipes and instruction.  Jamie encourages the reader to think for themselves and be creative to arrive at their own versions of his recipes.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Once you get started on the game you just can't put it down because there is, always something that is ready to pick or make or sell or and more come on and joined the fun!!!!!!!!
B008602KQI|3.0|It's a &#34;made for teens&#34; movie which is good for teens but not the best for everyone else.  Overall, an enjoyable film.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Ok mice with a apparently the same way as to return rented links for jellyfish down undo vote miles needs sea and must vote
B0056TYT66|5.0|This card is awesome and very reasonably priced. I've been using it for about a month, and so far no issues at all.<br />A few points that make me like this card so much:<br />1. The card has two separate independent chipsets on it, one for USB3 and one for SATA. This alone, sets this card apart from other combos which use a USB3 only chipset and a USB-to-SATA bridge.<br />2. Ability to use either a 4-pin Molex or SATA power connectors.<br />3. A never mentioned fact that with the use of the SATA to eSATA bracket and Microsoft standard AHCI driver installed, this card fully supports eSATA drives with all their hot-swapping, power management capabilities.
B00DGQF0K0|2.0|This game is good if you like to figure it out yourself. No explanation for reasoning or information on level at all.
B000UGG39Q|1.0|for the price it was in terrible shape not as advertised, should have been sold for a dollar with all the scratches on the CD and the cover very worn.
0307476073|5.0|One of my favorite books. We read this in my book club and we almost stopped at the beginning as we thought it would be a typical girl goes on drugs, gets off drugs sees the lights. It wasn't like that at all. The book was inspiring and I will read it again.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|It is a good book, but includes more information than necessary, making it boring at times. Other times it was hard to put down.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed reading this story, as it was very well told.  There are many twists and turns throughout the book and I found myself thinking what would I do in this situation.  Very thought provoking as it deals with real life's issues. I recommend this book!
B003JH8LPW|3.0|Interesting information about the cyber world of code making and breaking. A little stretch by putting a college professor in the part of secret agent for the NAS however.
B001TODCII|5.0|TAKEN is one of the best hard-boiled action films ever made. Emotionally charged is how I want to describe TAKEN, but that is an understatement. Singularly, Liam Nelson's no-nonsense performance makes this film. He is sensitive and laidback, but don't get him mad. Yet, he keeps a cool head and a keen mind to his sharp intellect underneath the all the mayhem and that is what really makes this film a cut above so many other films similar to this genre.
B006O6F932|4.0|Playset is fine but it shipped in it's box - so my daughter saw her Christmas present sitting on the front steps!!  So...thanks for that.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|It's very addicting and challenging. I really like match the games and this one keeps it interesting. Love to play this game, however, what does 'I see a fruit shaking mean'???
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Great Movie for the whole family! We laughed through the whole movie.  Great fun, no violence, cuss words or anything inappropriate.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book had me on the edge of my seat and keep my interest sparked from the first page to the last.
B00715SUI6|2.0|NO MEANINGS, CANNOT FIGURE OUT WHAT IT TALKS ABOUT. AND, THE MOVIE QUALITY IS SO BAD. SO, SO, SO, BAD
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game starts out pretty boring in my opinion,but,turns Into a fun, entertaining game.. I would recommend it!<br />Works great on my Kindle Fire.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|this was a fantastic show I enjoyed this season as much as I have enjoyed all the others thus far
B004MC8CA2|5.0|WONDERFUL application. There are devotions, studies,( seasonal )and you can save favorite verses so easily. There are many versions of the Bible available with this app.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|What is there not to love about Candy Cash. Everyone in my family plays it. Wished didn't have to wait so long for more lives.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|this is a wonderful game. I play it all the time. ok maybe not all the time because this is my grandma's kindle. but you know what I mean<br />:)
B00GTZN0X4|3.0|We loved the movie Cars and Planes starts out alot like cars. Has a good story line but was kind of boring.
B0088W2LC2|5.0|The Stargate Series is an amazing show & I Wish there was more episodes!  We need a new series or to restart this one..
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This was a great book. I love how she reviews her life and makes the based on memories and feelings.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|Review for the product, everyone already knows about the show.<br /><br />Before you receive your complete series, you might be a little skeptical about the quality just based on the pictures. Let me tell you, this is probably the coolest, most well built collector's edition that I own. The individual packaging of the seasons is great, high quality plastic with cool designs. The way they sit within the barrel itself is secure, and looks great.<br /><br />My only issue with the set is that the bonus disc that comes with the documentary, alternate ending, etc. is within the cap of the barrel and kind of hard to remove without feeling like you might break the disc, so just be careful with that and you're golden.<br />The challenge coin is &#34;heavy&#34;. Not some cheap piece of plastic. The apron itself comes wrapped tightly in plastic with two cardboard ends with a money design to give the appearance of the barrel being full of Walt's money when you remove the cap. Well worth the $200, I don't regret it for a second.<br /><br />(For those of you who bought the individual seasons prior to purchasing the complete series, you'll probably get a kick out of the Vince Gilligan letter).
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|When I downloaded this game I thought it might save my progress after the update.It didn't.<br />Racing games are a favorite for me. I mean I just like racing it's fun.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|So far it's playing good. But I'm not able to connect to my Facebook. Once I'm able to do so then I can possibly give it 5 stars
B0013ND30M|5.0|I've always loved this movie and now I can replace my 20 year old video. My grand daughter and I love to watch this together.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Fantastic plot. Well told story. Great characters played by talented actors! Good clean entertainment without a lot of hoopla. Couldn't ask for a better show.
B004G600A4|5.0|Love this movie. I like that it works for adults and children. My grand daughter loves it too. We love watching movies together.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Joss Whedon did an excellent job of writing and directing this film, and it is obvious the actors are having a lot of fun throughout. The film looks gorgeous, the special effects are outstanding, and the story is both interesting and fun.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy I got this game I wanted to get on my I pad but then I got on my kindle fire &amp; I was so happy!!!!!!!!!!!
B0080K3G4O|5.0|I always hated self help books, just because they break you and then build you back the way the &#34;technique&#34; is supposed to go. As I've noticed and learned from this book is that we are not created equal, so most self help books are not the right fit, even if we strictly follow them. Some of us just can't take positive thinking the way we are &#34;supposed&#34; to, some of us know from the beginning that even if we expect the best, we have to always prepare for the worst. What's different about this book it's that it really teaches to &#34;go with the flow&#34; and to accept life as a  fluid continuos process, not as a step by step kind of thing. And that goals don't bring happiness, effort and focus do, as long as you accept your limitations. I would recommend this book to the generation that was taught that if you want it, you can have it, just because you're special.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's ok it keeps me entertained. My little brother loves it so it keeps him off my hair, very helpful. Again amazing :)
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Clean wholesome family entertainment.  Nothing that has to be explained after to young ones or fast forwarding.  Rare these days!
B004BJMEO6|5.0|I enjoyed this DVD for the following reasons - good photography, excellent music, well acted, well directed, great trailers and realistic story line.
B0049PNOS2|5.0|Excellent music! I had to manually change the sound to 5.1 DTS (from LPCM default) but other than that it is a great sound recording.
B004G7UTXG|4.0|It has quality actors and a message that it conveys quite well. Knowing the history of this movie and the setting for this movie make it worth seeing based on accuracy.
1250012570|4.0|&#34;Eleanor & Park&#34; is an auspicious YA debut by Rainbow Rowell. Set in the mid-80s, the novel proves a genuine portrait of teen romance, while also probing themes of abuse, poverty and social class structure. It manages all of this with a quirky good humor, and lovely tributes to the power of music and comic books. While the big twist can be seen a mile away, and the book is a bit too long, these are small complaints for the rich rewards offered here for both young readers and adults alike. Rowell offers winning insights and even wisdom for the longing heart.<br />Strongly recommended for those not put off by strong language
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I actually read this for book club a year ago. It was very good!<br />I recommend this as a book club choice. We had quite a lively conversation at that meeting.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It's just as good as he first book if not a bit better the story follows on from the first one
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Typical Jack Reacher activities spiced up with an interesting accomplice.  Probably my favorite book in the series so far.  Enjoy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Fantastic book.  Definitely recommend reading this.  All 3 books draw you in and you don't want to put them down until you finish.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|AWESOME!!!!!! Best free run game i have ever played much better than temple run or temple run 2 ! !
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Fantastic book.  Definitely recommend reading this.  All 3 books draw you in and you don't want to put them down until you finish.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Love this series.  I hope to see more books from this author and I will be looking forward to the movie.  I think the writing is very solid and there were a lot of unpredictable and not typical aspects of the story and characters.
B00DW39B2K|2.0|Alone and apparently impervious to things like shock, blood loss, and pain that can't be walked off these two former enemies repeat their traumas together in a sloppy Freudian analysis session but with bows and arrows until they each realize that their pain is in fact the tie that binds. Hobbled, losing blood and exhausted they share a beer and go back to being what they were before the war, just cupla guys who like to have a good time and shoot or cut up animals for fun and should really be paying attention to their families instead of beating each other up.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have it on my ipod &amp; I am so very glad to have it on my kindle now! Now if I can just figure out how to merge both?!
B000NTHT6G|5.0|Engrossing, rich, complicated and full of life. This is the kind of movie that gets better as you watch it. It's own tight little snow-shaker of a world which captivates and sees all the richness in a mundane life. An excellent film whose of a dying breed. This is an odd little gem whose acting only enhances the delicious script. Stylish, loving and beautiful this is a joy to watch. A beautiful and extraordinary film.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Oh my glob. This was amazing I literally couldn't put it down. I was so intrigued and I just loved the ending
0345803485|1.0|This book was just a pile of trash. Couldn't finish and that never happens. Sorry I was sucked in by the hype and wasted my money.
B000002GJH|5.0|awesome just awesome. Cant believe I waited two decades<br />to get to this sidegig-album of chris cornell.<br /><br />The autorip feature with amazons MP3 service is a pleasure.
B007N85POS|5.0|I love all the Angry Bird games! This one is as good as the original angry birds, More levels please!
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|And great Music. I hadn't the foggiest notion that the Late, Great<br />Layne Staley had xtra curricular master work back in the 90's.<br /><br />But thanks to (Pandora-radio) I found out about this and purchased<br />the Deluxe edition and got free AutoRip MP3 included<br />by amazon cloud.
B0058UXHHK|3.0|It IS very addicting; I kept going hoping to just figure it all out. However the story was ill developed therefore that moment of satisfaction where everything falls into place never came. I was left with so many questions. (There's no moment of 'AHA ! It all makes sense now...')<br /><br />What was Sloan's involvement?<br /><br />What happened the night her mother died? (Momma not Dora)<br /><br />Who was breaking in (I still feel like atleast that ONE time that she hit the guy with a broom, it might have been Joe, & seeing as he was involved we don't really get an answer there!)<br /><br />Plus, this seems to me like NONE of this would have happened if she wouldn't have had the vision, which means the vision that she had only happened BECAUSE she had the vision. (If she would have never had the vision, Daniel Crocker would never had suspected her and therefore her vision would not have happened.  Her vision only happened because she had a vision of it, which is pointless. How can you vision something that will only occur because you're having the vision?)<br /><br />Nonetheless, this book was free and I did enjoy reading it. I just wish everything would flow more clearly (and I'm still waiting for my moment where everything suddenly makes sense). I'd still read the sequel since it was an addicting read, though it's still one of those books where you end up questioning things.
0062107313|1.0|I had a really hard time getting through this book and did not like any of it. I usually love Amy Tan's books and was excited to buy it but am very disappointed by it. Way too much detail about the brothels and the lives of the courtesans. Really it made no sense and I would return it if I could.
B00GNIOJNC|5.0|This is by far my favorite album out of the three. It's appears to me that they get better each time a new song/album is released. I look forward to their future content. &#60;3
B00CQZ65SI|5.0|I thought this was a very good book and was easy to understand.  I believe that the case for gluten sensitivity is perhaps a bit overstated in this book, the ideas are sound and I thought it was a good read.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I felt as though I had made some wonderful new friends who had invited me into their lives when I came to the end I was shocked and disappointed to discover it was over. It's been 2 weeks and I still miss them. I call that a perfect recipe for a good story.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great! I just love this game! addicting! It just needs to give you more lives.<br />it would be nice if we could receive special candies. once in a while- just because!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A great  master at intertwining all the pieces of past and present together. A lot of loose ends that pulled together at the end.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I've spent 5 months reading these books. Each book after the first becomes slow and tedious then bursts into fireworks. The big show in the last two books have not been worth it. We are introduced to too many minor characters and the characters we've come to know simply disappear, Sam for example. These books have become very unsatisfying. I don't think Martin has a clue as to how he's going to end this so he's endlessly dragging it out.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I liked the characters in &#34;a time to kill&#34;, being incorporated in this book almost like a sequel. Keep it up.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|This is a great story of incredibly brave individuals.The author presents us with the unvarnished truth of what these men do, and it is frightening. SEALS are often tasked with doing things that don't make the news, against enemies who have no regard for things like honor and duty.  They make great personal sacrifice from the moment they enter training, and yet the author tries to show us that they are just regular guys, with families and friends just like us, who happen to be doing an extraordinary job.  We cannot thank them enough for what they do to protect our nation.  They would probably say they were just doing their jobs.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|There are only 2 apps in it (Netflix and YouTube). Need more excitement. Every piece of technology today, from TV's to DVD players, etc. has more apps. What's the point of getting this one. I had an old Blue Ray DVD player that already has Netflix, YouTube and Pandora. One word, needs more juice. Cool gadget but now just became a part of TV that is not being used
B000GIXEIG|5.0|Beowulf & Grendel, although an old Danish myth, come alive with the acting of this cast who put their spirits into the characters
B00EDPFJA4|2.0|I ordered this after hearing his 2 singles that are on the radio that I really like. Was hoping he'd have at least one other good track on it but all the other songs are lousy IMO.  Disappointed with this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|If you love candy crush, you now can play it on the kindle. It was easy to download and sign in using Facebook to coordinate your progress, ask friends for lives and fun.
B000G7PNAE|5.0|I have a wonderful Journey collection of music - I loved this era of music.  It helps me to relive the time.
0804162727|5.0|This is an extremely good guide, the only thing is the lithograph is small. Other than that I would recommend getting this guide.
B000002KOJ|5.0|This is one of my favorite Joni Mitchell CDs in my collection for my college years.  I had learned to play the songs by ear on my piano. I continued to be influenced by her music - both the beauty of it and the clear, pure tones, high range and low range, for years. I also love her lyrics.
0804161380|5.0|This set is awesome, it is as advertised. This set comes in a very high quality box, this is a must have set for any Zelda fan.
B000002KBU|5.0|Joni Mitchell's Blue album is haunting.  I liked the blue songs very much and often play them around Christmas for myself. If you are in a blue mood, these songs express it for you. Many are love songs.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I've tried at least 3 different games, this mahjong is the best by far.  It's great for the mind, enough game's to keep it interesting...and I love the shuffle option...really good!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This was a gift to one of my sons. He does enjoy playing this.  His gift wish list included this game.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Once of the most amazing and complex books I have ever read. Even better because I live near where the book is set and can really relate.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|This is a good album by Lady Gaga. She had a sale on these when it first came out. She has great versatility and creates music in new ways that I have never heard before.  If you love this album, you can also get a poster of Lady Gaga.  If you or your family has great sympathy for &#34;Born This Way&#34; as an idea, everyone will love this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game I tried it on iPod and it was fun and saw it was on my kindle so I downloaded it  so much fun
B000002KOQ|5.0|Ladies of the Canyon also is another Joni Mitchell CD which I have in my collection of her music. I also love her art on the cover. I wished to get all CDs available from amazon for this folk singer.  She was my one supreme female folk singer, above all the others of this era.  To me, she also embodied California, what I love about that state, and especially Southern California.
B0086700CM|5.0|Okay, I have to admit this game isn't entirely stoopid. In fact, contrary to expectations, I enjoy playing it.<br />Tho I totally suck at it. I mean, I am bad. I scored 0 more then once.
B000000OSO|5.0|My family used to have Get a Grip on a cassette so I upgraded the album to a CD. I love this era and Aerosmith, I sing along. One of my children had this in his collection.  I also like Steve Tyler.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think they should put flint and steel on the creative inventory. AND make it almost exactly like the full edition. Or just put Redstone stuff in it.
B000002GWN|5.0|I have a collection of Joni Mitchell to help me remember my college years...  Her music continued to influence me as I grew older. Her first albums have those clear perfect tones.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Because Firefly is fantastic! Steve Miller wouldn't have had to sing about being a space cowboy if this 'Verse did exist. Thank heaven<br />for a series that really put a whole, loving twist on two genres at once: westerns and sci-fi. Great fun to see some of the actors reappear in Supernatural later on. Of course, not everyone is old enough to remember Ron Glass's detective character in Barney Miller, but even back then he was, and still is, a great actor who used to wear a bigger 'fro than the way his hair looked when he scared River. The mystery has been solved -- Ron Glass is still very much alive and still acting! Saw him on Major Crimes. Our shepherd still walks among us, along with Mal and Inara and all the rest. The 'Verse is vast, y'all. Keep flying!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome good graphics a bit choppy but maybe that's my connection. Other wise an overall good game. Make another one like this!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|More fun than candy crush because you can keep trying. There may be an infinite number of puzzles. Then there are the enforced waits. I don't like the buy offers for moves.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|All I wanna say is that this game is AWESOME! Ya know why? Cause it has excellent graphics and you get to play online . The only thing I don't like is the tokens. You should be able to go into a game without tokens , I'm not saying you need to buy them , I'm just saying they should fix it

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Lots of fun for a puzzle solver, seems odd that rating app is required to pass level 10, but with only 10% completed, I'm gonna review to continue.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|It's Galaxy Quest, it's all I need to say.  But Amazon wants me to say more, so ... I have watched this movie multiple times over the years since it was released in the 90's and it never gets old.  Never give up, never surrender!!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|An enjoyable read with a few twists and turns to keep it interesting, as well as a few humorous moments.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|From start to finish you will not be able to put this book down. Don't read before bed because you will not want to sleep.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's a very simple game but one of the most entertaining I've played. The game can go from super easy like on the 5x5 boards or it can make you want to rip your hair out like the 14x14 boards. Quick pass-time or not, probably everyone will get engaged in this puzzle game. Do reccomend!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Great sounding microphone and love the long cable.  For the price, you can't beat this little lav microphone.  Perfect for DSLR cameras.
B00C5R8364|5.0|I am living and working in Islamabad now, and the author certainly did his homework and got the scenes right that are set in this city.  Nice one.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Just not for me, maybe a little fast moving. I have had others I liked better. Give it a shot, it was offered free
B008JFURKG|5.0|We haven't watched the Blu-ray or DVD discs yet but we watched this in the theater and loved it. So glad they made a sequel to Red.  I wrote this because I wanted to give information that is not on the product details page.<br /><br />First of all, for months and months the Blu-ray listing only showed as &#34;Blu-ray.&#34;  Now there is finally an up-to-date photo of the cover.

B00EW9GQR6|1.0|Shallow and pointless pop. For a wannabe Madonna, Gaga will not last as long. Very disappointed in this mindless artpop with annoying sounds

B00FVVR2ZO|3.0|I love the game. Was disappointing I couldn't merge my phone and kindle accounts but the lack of updates for kindle is making me miserable. Fix update I'll change to five stars
B00CKR63F2|5.0|Beyond Bridalveil Fall by Sheryl Seal is an epic tale where your fantasy meets your greatest inner desire. It was a privilege reading this story filled with magical elements, good twists and turns which gave me a sense of wanting more.<br /><br />No doubt about it that this was my best read of 2013!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app. It helps both me and my daughter sleep through the night. Recommend to everyone. It's a great app.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Glad this app is finally available for Kindle users!  Fun, addictive, and challenging.  Wish there was no waiting for more lives. Would be willing to pay for the app if it included endless lives.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Is ok just Don't have all things I have when play on my laptop wish has all things have online
B00GO95TAC|4.0|The Day of the Doctor was a great 50th Anniversary episode. However it is not perfect.<br />There are two story lines during the episode. One of the stories is about John Hurt’s Doctor and why he is meeting two other Doctors (played by Matt Smith and David Tennant). The other story is about creatures escaping paintings. I don’t want to spoil anything, so I’m not going to go into detail about either of the stories. However, I will say that the story about the paintings takes up a big portion of the episode. And while this story would have been good for a normal episode it feels a bit weak for the 50th Anniversary special. Another issue with the episode is that it starts off slow and takes a while before the more entertaining moments happen.<br />With the negatives out of the way, now I’ll explain what I thought was good about the episode. The story about John Hurt’s Doctor is more interesting than the other story line. Seeing the Doctors work together and the big finale are easily the best moments of the episode. These two things alone almost overshadow the weaker parts of the special. There are also several fan service moments (which range from certain pieces of clothing to a certain actor making an appearance). Finally, the Doctor is given a new purpose to travel through time and space at the end of the special. While it takes a while to get to the good parts, overall the Day of the Doctor turned out great and is definitely worth watching for fans of the show.
B0031RDVNM|5.0|Hadn't read a Frederick Forsyth book in a long time, but he hasn't lost his ability to provide a twisting plot and hold the reader in suspense right through to the last page.
B0041D843M|1.0|He does not make the case for his central thesis: that veggan is the way to go.  There is appallingly little data to back up his arguments.  Very disappointing.
B0046B8GEQ|2.0|I see and hear a lot of references to this movie so I thought I should watch it. Afterwards, I felt it was a waste of my time. My impression was it was written by a committee based on focus group responses. It was completely predictable and had few interesting or likable characters. Only the minions were cute and likable and they were not particularly well used in the story.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The most accurate thing I can say, is that this is a truly  &#34;Well Written&#34; book.  I enjoyed everything about it, the story, the writing style, and it was a real  page turner. I got tired of novels with high ratings, that are SOO Naive to the point of being irritating, where characters and actions are no believable. This novel is not of them, it is very well written,  and does not insult your intelligence.<br />Really like, really recommend.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love the ease of use and record of history. The large size of the numbers make inputting less susceptible to errors and the activity more efficient.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very few glitches &amp; lots of fun! I play this game every day. Excellent way to kill time. I definitely recommend it for everyone.
0316055433|5.0|How rare is this book? Amazingly so. Ms Tartt is not only able to articulate the main character's brilliance but almost every page here is full of wild unusual wonderful brilliance--in the writing, in her characters, in an emotional rightness and most especially and in Theo, the most memorial of her brilliant characters.<br /><br />For me, this book has an equally rare coherence. I do not see it as a series of novellas, but rather from page one till the very end, Theo and co. are amazingly interesting, all alive, fascinating in their interests and loveable to the max.<br /><br />Every \\"minor\\" character is vivid too, also unique. Every move made by the main character makes unremitting sense. With the exception of Hugo, I loved each relationship and the subtitles' therein.<br /><br />Unlike some other reviewers, I never felt bored nor turned off because we read for language and philosophy; relationships and fate; coincidences and the relativity of good and evil.<br /><br />This is likely one of the three best novels I've had the pleasure to read with total immersion in my long life.<br /><br />Thank you, Donna Tartt for giving us such a rich and long story. I didn't put it down except to sleep and am only sorry it is now over for me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad this app finally came to Amazon. I love that I can play candy crush on my kindle. Now if they would keep up with Google and the I store I will be very happy
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Great story telling. Well written and well developed likable and engaging characters. Excellent acting. Tremendous cinematography. Extremely entertaining. Time well spend.
B0055PMJMW|3.0|I love Harry Bosch, let me put that out there first.  I gave this book only 3 stars because I felt the endings were too easy, too pat.  I've never had that experience with Michael Connelly, of whom I'm a huge fan.  The stories just suddenly ... stopped.  I felt like I was still in the middle of the story at the end.  Nonetheless, Connelly remains one of my favorite authors from his genre, and I look forward to more Bosch!
0307743721|4.0|Carefully observed and meticulously written stories by the Canadian writer. You never quite know where you're going with Munro but it's always worth the trip.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|My girlfriend's dad (and I, as well) is a huge Eagles fan. Scored big with this as a gift!! Great collection of stories and music. A  must for any music fan.
B009GXHOW4|4.0|Love it but can be a little tricky ps only for newbs gives lots of extra items but a cheater app
1577314808|5.0|I really loved this book because it gives me the answer I have always been looking for.Yes there is something I can do to ease mine and others suffering in this world. Also almost inspires me to go back in a church again but at the same time I know I don't really need to if I don't want to :) All I can say to Mr. Tolle is I'm so ready.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|What a fabulous novel--I will never forget it. Our hero, a sometime junkie, hopes to avoid cosmic level pain--he is a victim of terrorism, of lost and inept parents, of peripheral adult involvement. His talisman is the goldfinch, painted over 400 years ago, a bird/prisoner chained to a post, a representation of stablity and permanence in world bereft. Theo is taken in and cared for by a variety of families--some distant, some more lovable. His enduring family is Hobie, an antiques dealer (permanence) and Boris (wacky eternal friend).<br /><br />The last twenty pages or so are an absolute paean to art and its importance in our unstable world. It moved me to tears. Theo survives; a lover who gets part of what he wants, a successful human being who is only too aware of the fragility of this life, and a thoroughly sympathetic character who will break your heart and then put it back together again.
B00BNUBK46|5.0|Amazing Light. I just used it caving for a week long expedition and it illuminates very large stadium sized rooms!!!!  Do not hesitate buying this light for one second.  It is a great value for the level of performance you get.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|how do you get update on kindle fire love the game but would really like to update my app without getting rid of what I accomplished
B00B8R1NP0|1.0|I am not done reading this book yet, but felt compelled to write a review before anyone else thinks about buying it. Paid .99 too much for this book. The premise of the story isn't bad, but the writing is the WORST!!!  This guy must have friends in high places in the publishing business.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Mr Gaimam has a magical way of weaving his stories. There is always a surprise,and twist you don't see coming.
B00A9C3RNQ|3.0|It was darker than I thought funny. But still the funny parts were hilarious! As usual Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep don't disappoint - excellent and effortless performance.
B000T433CO|5.0|A feel good movie,  should be on your Christmas list of movies to watch for the holidays no pun intended!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Approaches the war from a different point of view. Shows that in the midst of great inhumanity and suffering, there were decent people like Liesel, Hans and Rosa.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Oh man, I think I have forgotten everything about this book I read as a child, and my mind is overshadowed by the old movie as well.<br />As always RSL has a prosaic way of writing, compelling, yet with that stiff Brit wit wound about his characters and story. I think I love this tale more than I did as a kid. Enjoying reading it again!
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Gotta love a book that can make you laugh and make you cry.  BUT it wasn't hard to figure out what was gonna happen next.  Still loved it though.
B000FA675C|5.0|When I read this years ago, I was smitten with all the deep twists and turns of historical references. While some of the references are real, and some are just of popular myth, Dan Brown's book was a great voyage into the bleak and dark mysterious unknown world of the Vatican, old religion, and new powers just trying to claim the world. Hurrah for a fast paced, intelligent adventure.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Just what I wanted!  I was afraid I might order the wrong version, but it was perfect!<br />I purchased 2 of them, one for my granddaughter and one for my daughter!  They both love this music.

B000OY8NII|5.0|Mayberry RFD meets Einstein and Tesla. This is a thoughtful, funny, provocative, entertaining series. Totally worth marathon watching... again again!
B008FYZIVY|3.0|Never opened it.  Bought it as a gift for a recipient who certainly didn't complain.  This was my second purchase of these DVDs.  By the time I had my own copies, I had already seen the Masterpiece Theater production on PBS.  It was fun to re-live favorite moments at will.
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|Nothing I'm going to say should deter you from choosing to read Drums of Autumn, the fourth book in the Outlander series.  However, because Amazon tends to want readers to review, I am going to mention some elements of this book that gave me pause and kept it from being perfect.  Overall, the book is as well written, researched and detailed as the previous three and worth the time I invested it it, but for me this one is not as thrilling and at times, felt ponderous.  I plan to read the fifth book, but I am approaching it with the trepidatious fear of a decline in the overall quality of the series.<br /><br />******************************************************SPOILERS**********************************************************<br /><br />This book centers on the relationship between Claire's and Jamies' daughter, Brianna and Roger McKenzie Wakefield a historian and friend to Claire and Bree.  They are two throughly modern young people in their early to late 20s.  Both time travel to the mid-18th Century, Bree in search of her mother and father, Roger in search of Bree.  I found it easier to accept Claire's initial time travel and subsequent return because both her generational upbringing ( England in the 20s and 30s) and her marriage to a scholarly historian would give her just a bit if a leg up on making the transition.  Bree, on the other hand is a child of the 50s and 60s.  She's been brought up in America and  retains her fairly modern speech patterns and many of the idioms.  Those idiosyncrasies don't seem to cause much if a stir among the strangers that she meets.  It's not a huge thing, but it did notice it.<br /><br />My second and somewhat larger complaint lay in Bree's Olympic quality conclusion jumping.  She and Roger become married by hand fasting and consummate their relationship.  Two days later she is raped by a pirate.  Upon finding herself pregnant she is immediately convinced that it is the child of the pirate.  Much of the relationship angst between her and Roger revolves around that assumption.  I found it a bit drawn out and contrived, but then many of Bree's actions and attitudes fell into that category for me.  Bottom line, I found Bree to be impulsive, headstrong and a bit of a pain in the backside.<br /><br />The best thing Ms. Galbadon does is to write characters who are very, very human.  In other words, flawed.  I am giving Ms. Galbadon the benefit of the doubt that that was her thinking behind the writing of Bree's character.<br /><br />My last concern centers on a scene with Claire as she performs inguinal hernia surgery on a man in the midst of a dinner party.  Even in the barbaric American colonies, a woman performing surgery in the region of a man's testicles in the midst of a dinner party strains credulity.  The fact that this surgery was witnessed almost without comment by the dinner guests breaks it completely.  It was a well written scene, but I just couldn't \\"buy it.\\"<br /><br />I've enjoyed these books up to this point.  Fingers crossed that the author's imagination doesn't stray too far in to the realm of incredulity in the next books.een her and Roger revolves around that assumption.

0307265730|1.0|A series of short stories which were very similar and all told in a &#34;Lifetime TV&#34; style. Writing was not exceptional, more like a sophomore English major writing for a college magazine.
B00F91H666|4.0|It's a pretty good story but a zombie movie is a zombie movie is a zombie movie. Brad Pitt was awesome.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is something for everyone ! No idea to large or small. Pretty easy to navigate  around.great App for everyone !
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Still an excellent show and the actors and actresses are amazing. This one does deviate a bit from the book but it still keeps the integrity of the characters.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|One word! Wow! I LOVED it! Hilarious and seductive rolled into one book. Couldn't put it down ended up staying up until 2:30 am to finish! I'll probably be tired at work tomorrow but it was so worth it!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Excellent show. The cast of characters are perfect and the plot follows the first book almost exactly as the author intended.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow!! What a great book! Not only is it a well written it left me wanting more! Would recommend to all!
B001NEI96O|5.0|great. the man is crazy. but its good he did this, because those buildings were demo by a demo team...not planes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great time killer but ever sense I got the update it can't even go to the main menu
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Pro:<br />1. Great Customer Service.<br />2. Product charges my NOTE 2 faster than regular charger [using 2A]<br /><br />Con:<br />1. Just bought it recently. So far so good.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I couldn't imagine how the author would end this series, but it was do good that I felt my throat get tight and my eyes well with tears.  Great story of love and sacrifice.
B008469DGY|5.0|Fun game to play, not as serious a game as some other golf simulators. Overall a nice tablet game to play.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|There are no clear instructions so I was left just tapping around on my screen. It was an okay app. Too bad it doesnt have more
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Great fun game. Addictive and challenging. Easy to play. Great buy. Great way to pass the time. Can't go wrong buying the game.
1449410243|4.0|For cat lovers everywhere, this tongue-in-cheek book will amuse you - just as long as you don't mind a bit of low-brow humour.  Makes a good coffee table book, and one that can be revisited.
B009RWRIKM|5.0|Best. Movie. Ever. If you don't know Pina, well, this is a brilliant introduction. Buy this. You will watch it again and again!
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I read this on my iPad, feeling very superiors because I had an iPad. I then got to the last chapters and felt shitty because I felt superior...nice job Allie for leading me into THAT cave, by the way. Allie zeroed in on my supposed animal whisperer capabilities, as well as my, &#34;Let me be/wait, don't leave me&#34; depression. Allie really knows that to get through this glorious life is by not taking yourself too seriously.  I love the book. I will now go out and by a hardback, which is what I should've done in the first place.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great read !  Recommend reading/listening to all of Stieg Larsson's books.  Amazon has a wonderful selection of audio books and lots of current publishes.  Prices are very good.
B00FLDG5AA|5.0|A must have for Clapton and all Blues lovers, a masterpiece..I was amazed at all the talent contained in one piece of music!!
B00DM12ANO|4.0|Good sci-fi flic. Good acting although the guy should not have used an American accent... Great and unique story concept.
B008MM9630|3.0|I am a big fan of fairy farm, I play it everyday. But lately its giving me tremendous trouble...its given me a quest to collect broken caskets but some says that casket flowers are no longer available, some say its in a specialty box. How am I suppose to do a quest that I cant get the necessary tools to complete? Everyone says that there was a recent update but my app has not registered, I guess, that it needs to be updated.. My biggest problem is casting spells, it will not let me cast a spell, ive gotten multiple fresh words from facebook and all it ever tells me is&quot;Error. Incorrect or expired magic word. Try a more fresh word.&quot; I get my words cast within a minute of a new word and it just wont give me anything but that message, its very frusterating. Not to mention Ive completed a couple of quests, including the quest Forgotten Treasure, and it will not recognize that I have completed the actions....multiple times...Also I am signed into my facebook account but would like to change which account it connects to, I would love to be able to control that aspect of it... Thank you, I hope to hear back or to see the game work a little better.(:
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's so much fun love too play you have to get it and it keeps you on your toes because the back round is always changing like London to Italy to Ireland.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Brought me to tears. A real hero that lived to tell the story of his best friends. Danny, Axe, and Mikey will never be forgotten
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was looking for a product to primarily stream HBO Go.  I have a Google DVD Blue-Ray player that has internet capabilities (surf the web, netflix, etc.) but does not allow for HBO/Hulu.  I was apprehensive in spending money on additional apple products, as I'm not convinced that I want to be tied to the ecosystem.<br /><br />I do have an iPhone/iPad/Nexus 7.  With the nexus 7, and increased integration of Google services, I found the Chromecast very intuitive to setup and use.  Once plugged in to my TV (you will need a HDTV with HDMI connections and WiFi), it was as simple as turning to the HDMI input on the TV, locating the wifi network, and entering the password.  I was very pleased with how easy the setup was and the picture quality of the streaming content. I am looking forward to additional services once developers have a little more time with it.<br /><br />For $35, this has been a great buy.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really don't see what all the fuss is about this game. I don't feel it's addicting like other games to me this is just like be-jeweled blitz or other games like it.
B0053JJLLC|5.0|Excellent book, started a little slow but necessary to cover material, once it got started it was really good!  Would love more like this.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|It's an easy read, full of historical information from a very interesting time in America.  Many parallels from our time make it even more interesting.  Highly recommend!
B0000E6XH3|4.0|great. i had the download of this for a long time until i got the official. i deleted the downloaded copy after purchase. i am in love with this. the colors and anime artwork styled animation is done so well. highly recommended.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|My 9 year old son rated this as \\"awesome\\".  He indicated that the graphics are really great, and that the app is challenging but still a lot of fun.
159463176X|5.0|I just adore all Khaled Hosseini books, told with such passion, feel like i know the characters,,,just have to wait TOO long for the next book...hurry up !!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome book! Holds your attention to the very end! You will feel yourself pulled into the story and really like the characters.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Good to see King & Maxwell back to getting involved in a strange and odd set of circumstances that turns into a national crisis.
0307352153|5.0|The book is well written by an author who understands introversion both academically and personally and is able to convey that to the reader. She also is able to engage and reveal the extrovert to him/herself.
B000WFBC6E|1.0|I bought this clock in at the end of August, so it arrived in mid September.  I hung it on the wall and noticed after a few days that it had lost time.  I changed the battery and tried again - it continued to lose time and is now hours behind.  I am outside the 30 day returns window so I understand that can't return the clock but it is clearly faulty and manifestly unfit for purpose.  I have bought better $20 clocks than this.  Do not buy.
0143122010|4.0|Excellently written and researched.  Could have a bit more about the underlying causes of violence--the institutional or &#34;powers and principalities&#34;.
B00F880BWG|2.0|Only the first 14 minutes downloaded, which is about 2/5 of what the whole episode would have been rated : (
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This book was researched and written with a powerfully quiet pen. Malala unfurls the real truth of a small piece of land called, &#34;Swat.&#34; This area became part of Pakistan. It is a straightforward look into the way these people live, think and act. One brave girl, Malala tells the story of the politicians, the military and how the Talaban came into being. An awesome book worth reading
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|This was a GREAT book!!! I love reading this book. It is good to read this interesting book for fun
B00GH4R95C|5.0|I was completely surprised how well this movie was done.  I didn't think it could be better than other start-ups but I was wrong.
B005721W9O|4.0|Campy, entertaining, and just plain fun.  Suspend reality for 100 minutes,strap in, and just go along for the ride.  This is science fiction, in a Hollywood farce hop-skip-jump.  I detected a grin on my face, so I must have been enjoying myself, and you should too.
B001GQ2BNQ|5.0|This product is great for people just getting into swimming so they focus on the swimming aspect, this is also really good for people with neck injuries so they don't have to head turn to breath. This product lets you focus on swimming and will give you better endurance.Probably will get some weird looks but this is a great product.
B00DNV9V1W|5.0|Easy to apply!  Looks great,  feels great to the touch.  Having 3 in a pack is even better. Plenty spares! Fits like a charm.  Love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm addicted to this game. I cant stop playing it. I get so mad when my kindle is not charged because then I cant play it. This game is the best game ever.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|One of the best action/sci-fi movies in over a decade.  Dredd has all the elements of a good 80's action/sci-fi flick but with modern filming techniques and better special effects.  I love the fact that he never takes his helmet off for the whole movie.<br />Good character development, pauses in action to build suspense, classic use of the bad/good hero.
B001P06GX4|4.0|This is a holiday gift for my niece.  I am sure she will love the game!  The shipment arrived as promised and in great condition.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It was a different kind of story and an unusual topic which I think makes for good discussion. It makes you wonder how well you really know someone.
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|This was the best adaptation of the book that I have seen. The personalities simply fit. DiCaprio was, as always, excellent, and Mulligan had the right dose of nasty, but with disarming manner. The movie is opulent, glittering, and totally over the top, but still the rich Fitzgerald tale shines through. A wonderful movie for all fans of this timeless book, and I highly recommend seeing it.

0385743564|5.0|The short review: IT WAS EPICCCC!!!  PURE EPICNESS!<br /><br />The longer one: So I went to the Austin Teen Book Festival 2013 an saw that Brandon Sanderson had this huge (like three or four times bigger then the longer ones) line and at the time did not understand why he had so many more fans then the other authors who's books I had read and thought were amazing.  But now I get it!  The world imagined in Steelheart is so amazing and realistic.  I know it's fiction and there were a lot of gadgets and powers that are not real (at least right now) but it still seemed very plausible.  Like the cell phones they were more advanced but not so much that I could not see them getting like that in ten years.  The whole setting from the social hierarchy to the futurist guns and superhuman powers is just phenomenal!  I liked David enough as a MC but would have connected much better I think if there was a chapter or two before he meets the Reckoners.  Megan I absolutely adored though and I hope to see more of her, especially her back story and maybe some chapters with her POV in Firefight!  I would love that so much!!!

B00BAXFECK|5.0|This is a book that is larger and more extravagantly beautiful than the sum of its parts, and each of those parts is utterly exquisite.  The language, the structure, the character development: all so well-done that one would forgive Ms. Tartt if the tale itself was less than gripping. But in fact, the story line is brilliant, leading the reader through precarious twists and  turns, layering event upon event, until, about ¾ of the way through the book, I thought there couldn’t possibly be a satisfying denouement. But of course, there was.<br /><br />What is it about?<br />Conflagration and confluence.<br />Despair, loss, transcendence, friendship, love, art, fear, time.<br />Secrets and beauty.<br />Darkness and light.<br /><br />I’ve been a reader (and armchair critic) of literary fiction for many years – about 40, give or take. In that time, I’ve probably read close to 1,000 books. Only a handful have been as beautifully wrought as The Goldfinch. The eponymous bird, “trapped in the heart of light”, describing the painter, protagonist and perhaps the author herself. I am bowled over by the talent of this amazing writer.<br /><br />“…there’s a middle zone, a rainbow edge where beauty comes into being, where two very different surfaces mingle and blur to provide what life does not: and this is the space where all art exists, and all magic.” – D. Tartt: The Goldfinch

B00BWYX2MG|1.0|Tried this product on two different sets of gloves.  First pair was the leather Firstgear gloves that are used with the heated liners. No go.  Second pair was an older leather lighter weight that I use for milder temperatures. No go. Re-read the instructions, watched the video, and started over this time on my left gloves.  Again, no go on both.  Was hopeing this would allow me to use an iPad mini or iPhone5.  Very uneven results and quite unsatisfactory. Definitely would get me killed trying to work the iPad.

B00GX598FO|5.0|This movie was a lot of fun.<br /><br />Most sequels never live up to the original. In my opinion, Red 2 is much better than the first movie. What I liked most was the mix of comedy and action. It was consistent throughout the movie and everything blended smoothly.<br /><br />Synopsis: Frank Moses/Willis has a new life with his girlfriend Sarah/ML Parker but is sidetracked when the government puts out a hit on him and Marvin/Malkovich and declares them terrorist. Apparently Frank and Marvin had some involvement regarding a project during WWII called &#34;Nightshade.&#34; Moses and crew are thrust into a wild ride across the planet to fix everything.<br /><br />Action: Fight scenes are great and well done. An excellent car chase. Several gun battles. All the main actors in this movie get their chance to shine.I really enjoyed watching VIctoria/Mirren. She totally kicks butt and can handle her guns. Han/Byung-hun Lee adds a little KungFu action.<br /><br />Acting/Writing: Most of the time I separate acting and writing. Not this time. Usually, when a lot of top notch actors get together, the movie suffers in many other areas, especially writing. Not in this movie. Everyone worked well together. Everyone got their funny moments and there were plenty. Unlike a lot of movies I have watched recently, this movie did not have to rely upon vulgarity nor profanity.<br /><br />Family friendly: Very little cursing. Lots of killing/shooting/fighting. No nekkid people nor sexual stuff. So, basically the violence is the worst.<br /><br />If I had to pick one negative about this movie it would be Sarah/Parker. I found her to be a wee bit annoying. She seemed out of place.<br /><br />This movie is well worth the rental. One of the better movies I have seen this year. I rarely give 5 stars to a movie, However, since this movie shines above the competition with great acting/writing/action, it is getting the full 5.

0062107313|4.0|This is a very different novel, and not for everyone. It’s quite long, and I, frankly, found much of the first half tedious going.  It does get good – very good, in fact, but it takes its time getting there.<br /><br />We have a mother and daughter team, although through most of the book, we only learn about the mother through what her daughter Violet observes.  Violet’s mother is an American woman who owns a high-class courtesan house in Shanghai, China during turbulent times.  The women in the house entertain men, and I mean “entertain” in almost every sense.  They sing, flatter, play instruments, flatter, tell stories, flatter, converse, flatter, and, only after being “courted,” provide sexual favors.  How Lulu got there is not quite clear to Violet, not that she considers it much.  It’s only when she finds her mother has lied to her, that Violet’s father did not die years before and that Violet has a brother, that Violet starts to see a larger world.  She has, to that point, been very sheltered.  She doesn’t even know that she is half Chinese.<br /><br />Violet is in for even bigger shocks.  Through some of her mother’s past and present choices that could be viewed as selfish, self-centered, or just plain foolish, Violet becomes separated from her mother and is forced to become a courtesan herself.  The mother disappears from the novel at this point, and she only reappears to tell her story near the end.<br /><br />Fourteen-year-old Violet, meanwhile, is put on display at various entertainments in order to entice men into bidding on the right to “deflower” her when she turns 15.  Violet has no choice but to go along with this as she, essentially, is the property of the house’s owner.  She has no power and few options.<br /><br />As a successful courtesan, she lives in relative comfort, but she knows that her time is short and her future is tenuous.  We hear horror story after horror story about their lives.  A courtesan is considered old by the time she is 25, and most begin a downward spiral even earlier.  And Violet’s life does spiral out of control.  At times, it seems that anything that could go wrong for this girl does go wrong.<br /><br />Complicating things throughout is her confusion on her identity.  She has gone from seeing herself as a wealthy and privileged American girl, to a deceived half-Chinese, half-American girl, to a slave who can be beaten or starved.  Due to the changing political situation, she at times has to hide or downplay her American roots, and at other times, she has to hide her Chinese roots.<br /><br />Even more troubling, we recognize some of the same traits in her that we saw in her mother.  Let’s just say she makes some foolish choices herself.  Like her mother, she can be tricked and taken advantage of by a man who seems sincere and sympathetic, despite warning sign after warning sign.  Anything for love, or a semblance thereof.<br /><br />I found it difficult to care all that much about Violet through the first half of the book.  It is only when things seemed to, very quickly, go from their best to their worst that I finally started rooting for her to survive and possibly even flourish again.  It seemed that when she gave up her complacency and acceptance (in her defense, she really had few choices and very little control) and really started to fight, I really started to like her, as well as her companion.  I would say the last fourth of this book is very good and is much more interesting than the first three-fourths.<br /><br />I should add that this book is at times very graphic in its descriptions of sex and a few depictions of sexual violence and depravity.  The language can be quite vulgar.  It is certainly a more realistic portrayal of prostitution and its accompanying abuse than such “romantic” and sanitary depictions as we often see in movies -- the “Pretty Woman” fantasy.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book for Amy Tan fans,with the warning to be patient through the first half.  Think about how unimaginably horrid it must have been to be a female at a place and time where you had virtually no freedom, and, like Violet, hang on until things change.with the warning to be patient through the first half.

B0000DG00B|5.0|I can't add much to the generally insightful comments of others on this one.  It is one of three live ABB sets I own, with Fillmore East being my all-time favorite.<br /><br />One small quibble I have is the lack of separation between the guitarists.  On my headphones, they both appear at about &#34;11 o'clock,&#34; which is to say a bit left of center.  Generally, on other recordings, they seem to derive from definite left-right positions.  Like I say, a small thing, but I get a kick out of the Allman-Betts &#34;battles of the guitars&#34; sub-aspects, a little added pleasures during my many thousands of listenings to the great ABB!
B008JFURII|5.0|Red 2 is as funny as the first one.  I like the dry humor of Willis.  Malkovich is a hoot with his crazy antics. Helen Mirren is great with her gun toting activities.  They are tracking a nuclear device that has gone missing and in the process are confronted by assassins and deranged government people.  The action is fast and the dialogue is funny.  Usually sequels don't live up to the first one, but this one does.

Who or want killed the miners and who is the arsonist?  The connection to a Sherlock Holmes story is stretching the plot a lot..the tie is tenuous.  The plot is dry, plods along, and you can guess who the arsonist is one-quarter through the book.  Definitely not one of his better books,
034580404X|1.0|What a waste of my time.  I cannot believe I read all three of these books.  I kept thinking....this story has to get better, and the prose the author has written has to improve...I was wrong.  My advice to the author - use a thesaurus.  I got tired of reading the same descriptive words with every turn of the page.  I also got tired of reading the same argument...hey, didn't they have this same fight, over a different topic last chapter?  And I got tired of the author going to the sex scenes when it was obvious there was nowhere else to turn with the story.<br /><br />It was disappointing because I believe the action plot of the story could have changed my opinion of the book, but it was only briefly touched upon, and usually solved within 3 paragraphs to 2 pages.  What?!?!  And then back to sex.  Sigh.<br /><br />I won't spoil anything, if you haven't read this book, but the ending was way too cookie cutter for me.  All in all, this is a trilogy that should have been, in my opinion, could have been one book.<br /><br />If you are looking for hot sex scenes, get the cliff notes version - or better yet, read a better author...I suggest Sherilyn Kenyon, JR Ward or Laurell K. Hamilton (in the paranormal realm) or heck, classic Jackie Collins if you don't like paranormal.  Not only do they deliver on the sex scenes, but their characters have depth and the plot lines are actually interesting.<br /><br />I wish I would have listened to my avid reader friends & not the &#34;hype&#34;.  But now I'm out the money & the time.  Grrr.
B00A2H9P98|5.0|I saw this one at the movie theater and knew I had to get the DVD.  Channing Tatum is a security guard for a senator but wants to get into the secret service.  Jamie Foxx is the president who is trying to swing a peace deal with the Middle East.  James Woods is the head of the secret service.  Channing takes his daughter to the White House to go on a tour while he is interviewing for the secret service. She goes to a rest room and at that precise time a paramilitary group storms the White House and kills or captures everyone in site.  Channing is not captured and he is the only one in the White House to get president Jamie Foxx to safety and to also find his daughter.  The action is fast, believable and has surprises.  What is the real purpose of the terrorist group and who is behind it?  A must see.
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|Overall this production of Jane Eyre tells the story, but, honestly there is one from the 90's that I personally think is better. This movie did not focus as much on her childhood, which I felt was too important to skimp on.
B008JFUS5A|3.0|Catching Fire makes a number of improvements over its lackluster predecessor and is a much better film for it. After a very strong first half though, it takes a bit of a dive and by the end I was left a little underwhelmed.<br /><br />Before I get to that though- the positives. One of my biggest problems with the first film was that it took a weighty, horrific, and tragic concept and turned it into a film that felt too light and easily digestible. It could be the fault of the source material (I haven’t read any of the novels), but it felt like so much thematic potential was wasted on flimsy, poorly choreographed action sequences and a hackneyed love plot. After a promising half-hour, the film quickly devolved into a standard action/thriller affair that barely scratched the surface of the intriguing concept. Catching Fire definitely rectifies this for the most part. It feels appropriately weighty and more solemn that the first film with public executions and other atrocities of the Capitol put on clear display. It also delves more into the psychology of fear and how it can be used to oppress which is a welcomed bit of depth.<br /><br />The excellent cast helps to sell all of these heavier moments. The acting in the film is uniformly excellent, and once again Stanley Tucci steals every scene that he’s in. The award for most improved character unequivocally goes to Katniss though. In the first film I felt that she came off as overly stoic and enigmatic. I realize that these traits are supposed to be elements of her character, but on screen it didn’t translate well and she seemed emotionally flat and distant. Katniss in Catching Fire is a much more dynamic character with clear moments of desperation, helplessness, strength, and resolve. Thanks to the excellent performance of Jennifer Lawrence and the improved script, she feels like a much more fully realized character with the power and charisma to properly carry the film.<br /><br />Like its predecessor though, Catching Fire is still a very front-loaded film. Essentially every great scene in the movie is over by the time it reaches the halfway point. One scene in particular I found to be particularly well done was the scene where Katniss and Peta are broadcast to the Capitol for the first time outside of their houses in Victors’ Village. The scene jumps back and forth between the bright, glittery stage of the Capitol where the broadcast is being played and the barren, dark, and dreary village. It creates a poignant visual metaphor that very successfully conveys the superficiality of the games that comes across it a subtle and tasteful way. I sensed a bit of social commentary in this scene as well concerning our own entertainment in the real world and how superficial and plastic it so often is.<br /><br />The weighty, intriguing scenes like this though slowly but surely gave way to a final act that once again left me wanting more. The hunger games themselves were definitely better in this film than they were in the last. The participants felt a little more fleshed-out and had their own distinct personalities rather than the one-dimension villainous participants we were treated to in the first film. The action sequences were also choreographed and filmed much more coherently. Still though, I felt the portion of the movie that takes place in the hunger games once again disrupted the flow of the film and deadened the narrative tension that had been building up until that point. Once the games start, there is almost no attention paid to any of the characters other than those inside the dome. All of the thematically interesting, morally thought-provoking scenes are left behind for uninspired action sequences which just drag on and on. We basically just watch Katniss and friends run away from poison fog, rabid apes, tidal waves and other dangerous things over and over. It’s a jarring transition from all of the political intrigue and dramatic, weighty character interactions that came before and just sticks out like a sore thumb.<br /><br />Ultimately, Catching Fire takes a lot of steps in the right direction but there’s still undoubtedly room for improvement. It once again fails to fully impress with the actual hunger games portion of the film but there’s also a lot of powerfully acted and poignant moments as well before it enters that final slog. These are the moments that give me hope that the series will be able to truly deliver on its interesting premise in future films.<br /><br />3.5/5t came before and just sticks out like a sore thumb.<br /><br />Ultimately, Catching Fire takes a lot of steps in the right direction but there’s still undoubtedly room for improvement.

B009O2XY12|5.0|i play it everday. it does not get old and i have had it for a long time. it is the only game i play.
B004J88SGC|5.0|This is a must-have DVD if you are just a small fan of Billy Joel!<br />Gives me goosebums everytime I see it. A firework of all his classics, accompagnied by numerous other stars like Sir Paul McCartney, John Mellencamp, Steve Tyler, etc.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is great for kids and I would recommend it for all ages! It was an amazing book, I loved it!
6305265488|5.0|What more is there to say??? This is every girl's dream come true. Minus the whole slave part. The thing I like about the movie is that the main character was mainly just herself (as far as her personality). She had courage and conviction throughout all she did. She was passionate about things she believed in. I wish she had told the prince the truth in the beginning. But I suppose that the movie would have ended too soon and there would be no suspense/drama to keep you tuned in to the story.
B003F3PMYI|4.0|Shaun writes in an engaging way and by encapsulating various research studies within his 7 principles he makes this accessible to many. There is a tone throughout the book that's a bit too &#34;slick self-help&#34; proselytizing. The writer obviously loves sharing this information that he is so passionate about. However, there is a bias here towards uses in business and multi-national corporate culture that can, at times, distance readers who have no connection or experience in that arena.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|easy and fun to play. I would recommend trying it. the graffix are pretty good too. cant beat it for free
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|Great game! It's challenging, but not so difficult you just give up. Not a short game...lots of levels. Worth the money!
B006IDG2T6|3.0|Harris was clear in pointing out his concept regarding the absence of free will. I thought the book to be well written and backed up with sufficient evidences.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I've been an FOB fan for a long long while, when they were on their indefinite hiatus I felt very sad. They came back on this album with a new spirit. Great songs on this
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Typical Grisham - a winner!!! I love his plots and words.Excitement, movement, characters to explore. Grisham is an author I always turn to
B000EXZI0A|5.0|These guys were more than a band, they were a movement. Not just a damn good punk band, but a testament that punk wasn't just an import from Europe. Every music collection should have this one (or better yet, the full catalogue).
B002ZG980U|5.0|This is the second copy I've ordered of this movie. It's one of those films that you have to watch a few times to catch the things you missed the first viewing, but that's what I love about it - it's like watching it the first time each time!
030758836X|4.0|This novel had a unique and chilling plot. It was a great read from the first page to the last.  I'll look forward to Gillian Flynn's next novel.
1401907725|5.0|The quality of this deck is PHENOMENAL. Beyond that, I've had decks in the past that didn't include the messages ON the card and hated that... these do - which is probably why it's one of my favorites! My aunt purchased the same deck earlier this year and as soon as I saw it I had to buy my own copy!
0375842209|5.0|Extraordinary book. I started out not wanting to like this book, but after a few pages was absolutely enthralled. Would give it ten stars, if I could.
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|I love the books by Preston and Child...this was another one that I just couldn't put down! Another captivating thriller!
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Yea its worth it but I can't beat alies usa it has a little blood and gore though and people are way to powerful on war
B009UX2YAC|4.0|A good game sometimes  boring during travel the world kinda racist when u choose a chapter to play as but really fun
B0015AARJI|5.0|One of the most underrated controllers ever.  Feels and performs very nicely and has a long battery life.  Purchased this to replace my dead one and it has so far held up perfectly.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|the graphics are amazing! it is so real that it feels like you are actually hunting. there are the coolest animals. albino bears and black wolves. I would 100% reccomend this to anyone who is interested.
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|This movie is very funny.  My kindergarten child loves watching it over and over.  The toy that came with it was nice.
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|This is not a hunting game it a shooting and killing game.  It has no hunting theme to it you simply start in front of an animal and shoot at it,
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|At first I didn't understand some of the songs. As I listened more & more I hear what Jimi was trying to do. It's on par with the Purple Haze album or even the Bold as Love album. I like it all now.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love Stephen King's books although not all of them. This is, by my opinion, best from him this far.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great pack for the money! I use it for my Nikon 5100 w/ 18-55mm, and 3 extra lenses (Nikon  55-200mm, Nikkor 50mm, Tamron 10-24mm) plus a Speedlite 900 and the usual accessories, like filters, batteries, charger, etc.  With all that, it's a full pack, but it fits fine. When I add another lens, I'll have to get a bigger pack but it works perfectly for what I have now. It may or may not be the highest quality out there, but it certainly serves the purpose..has padding and my gear feels &#34;protected&#34; when I'm lugging it around on location. I've carried it over a year (frequently) and it still looks good, all zippers are intact and I have no complaints.
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|While I applaud the author for her writing and her tremendous research, the book was heavy into botony.  The story was good. It just was a bit too involved in the science of things.  Worth reading....
1439152810|5.0|The Secret is this book rocks! Wow...well developed, intriguing...this is a perfect web of past and present, character development secrets from WW II and more...make sure you pay your bills and feed your family because everything is on hold until you finish this winner!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Can hardly wait for July.  Too bad don't have access to time machine so I could read the next book in the series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is very fun  with no problems and passes by time i totally get it get it get it
0615782043|5.0|G.P.A., uses Revenge of The Orgasm (An Erotic Biography) to connect synapses to one's nervous system. His words are succinct as if blasphemous to waste in abundance. His point of view is hermaphroditic as he masterfully scribes utilizing His and Her voices. Gordon is proficient in how he pens a solitary moment from the voyeur's perspective. Acts that seem inherently debaucherous are semantically sumptuous. Steamy musings capture the sensual  innocence of a Kim Basinger in \\"9 1\2 Weeks\\" yet frees the inhibitions of the Anastasia Steele's of 50 Shades of Grey. Readers will feel as if they have entered a courtship phase with the Author. One enters his psychosis effortlessly. Like a forbidden massage, GPA never ceases to provide a happy ending.<br /><br />Kiley Brown-Honey Drip Radio Personality, Poet, Writer
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun...but I don't like having to wait for a new life. And I won't spend money to buy a new life.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Great Book and motivating for professional women who are looking to move up in their company or industry. I have already recommended this to my female co-workers even though I am only half way through the book.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|The quality of the acting is outstanding! I've seen Madds M. In several subtitled film and have been a fan for years. I especially loved him in after the wedding  and adam's apples. A great supporting cast and grizzly cases make it a fun and exciting series.
080701429X|1.0|This is a terrible book.  I read this for a leadership class I was in and it was one of the most unteresting books I have ever read.
B000I3UMKM|5.0|I haven't seen this since it came out when I thought it was terrific and it seems even better now.  2013
B00G21XNKU|5.0|It was FANTASTIC!!!!! We just loved it, and the high definition quality was wonderful. The Doctor at his finest! GREAT!
B009ME47H2|4.0|A very handy app for anyone wanting to do some voice recording. Sound quality, although not hi-fi, is acceptable and functional for playback. Very handy for Kindle users wanting to tape something for later playback.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I know this is a &#34;classic&#34;, but it is a hard read. I've been plugging away at it for a couple of months now, and that's a long time for me. The story is wonderful, but it keeps getting lost in a lot of wordy information. Honestly, I just skip over a lot of it. It makes no difference to the story what streets are where in some little French town, but there are pages dedicated to the subject. And there are several passages and quotes in French. Sorry, don't know the language. I will keep at it though, just to say I've made it if nothing else and I really do want to know how it ends.
B00FMZ22CM|4.0|Street View on Google Maps<br />A very nice and handy version of the full-fledged Street view available from the desktop version of  Google Earth. This app gives a limited fixed version of A given spot, with a 360 degree view from that spot. However, as in the full version, it does not allow for TRAVEL  along streets and roads. Still, it is handy if you want to get photo view of a specific destination, with a look 360 around - provided, of course, that the particular location has already been covered by Google Street View.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|This is by far the best 8 ball pool game ever you will fall in love so addicting it's crazy how much this game has going for it I highly recommend getting this game.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I love this. I can finally get YouTube on my Kindle Fire, but as of yesterday, it stopped playing videos. I could no longer watch anything. I deleted it and redownloaded it, and also shut down and restarted my device. Tip for ads: if ads pop up while watching videos, just pause the video for 5 seconds then press play again. There should be no more ads on your screen!!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|For the mobile version it's great. The console is still better but the fact you get in game rewards for both versions is great.
1609611543|4.0|Great book.  After eliminating the bad foods the book talks about I have lost 15 lbs in 6 months.  I feel really great and have much more energy.  Goes into detail about the history of wheat and why it affects our health in such a negative way.<br />  I did miss pizza and beer at first but there are gluten free alternatives. I drink Corona beer now.  Not my favorite but OK.
B0009P66TK|1.0|I bought this watch for my boyfriend, but I got another model. The model I received is the Subaqua Noma IV Collection. They were wrong too big. The model I received is not what I ordered, so I give this rating, I hope they send me the correct model
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game and very challenging.great for adults and kids. one of the few games i would let my children play
0984380213|5.0|This book contains detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to build a modern day sales team. I've found it to be extremely applicable. Aaron gives specific tips and explains the logic behind them.<br /><br />I cannot possibly recommend this book highly enough. In fact, at my firm, I'm thinking about making it a required read for all new sales leaders.
B000SEKNUK|5.0|An absolute pleasure to read, so easy and inspiring. I really recommend it. Quotes and thoughts that I can see myself coming back to in the future.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, though I do agree with the comment that, after all the suspense and court maneuvering, it ended up with a settlement which could have been achieved much earlier without all the problems.  Also, I disagree with the notion that just because they are children, they deserve anything from the estate.  Read the book, but be prepared to be disappointed by the ending.
B008JFURKG|5.0|Ok many spoke about the plot, different characters and the over all movie. I really enjoyed this movie but I do not think it was better or worse than the original; just a different movie. Both Red and Red2 are enjoyable movies and I would strongly suggest seeing both. Its well worth the cost for the bluray or DVD. Its a enjoyable movie and just me sitting here writing this tells ya how much I enjoyed the movie....
1476727651|3.0|I just find too many similarities of this story not only with &#34;The Shining&#34; but also with King's son Joe Hill's &#34;NOS4A2&#34;:<br />Young gifted child with special powers fighting evil and helped by an older gifted mentor. Spoiler Alert follows: In Dr. Sleep and NOS4A2, a young girl capable of traveling long distances fights evil person that kidnaps young children to suck out their energy allowing the evil doer to continue to live for many, many years. Come on! Father and Son should not discuss each other ideas at the dinner table or should just write one book. I am a little disappointed.
0547260695|5.0|A favorite tale practically comes to life in this wonderful pop-up book! My God-son will keep this as a treasure amongst all his treasured books.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I Use it all the time, works well, it hasn't fallen apart like the insulation of the old one did.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I have had fun playing this game.  It can be set for different levels of skill which is nice for beginners like myself.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is not only fun and roboticly violent but you can also buy paints foelr them and that gives even more money
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|It is very good with graphics and how it has multiplayer online for Irene that can help you out through the game.
B009NF54ZE|3.0|I thoroughly enjoy playing this game. It has a good variety of games, a reasonable amount of time between hints, and no need to buy anything. I would have rated it higher if the games weren't the exact same each time you played them.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Pretty cool game just wish you knew how much things are and get more money easily. Plant more houses and other stuff.
B008JFURKG|1.0|This was a total waste of time and money.  I really enjoyed the first Red, but this just didn't cut it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It'S FUN<br /> TO PLAY AS gta vice city is and all other apps are like minecraft pocket edition is  there all fun
6304712936|5.0|Fabulous movie!  Great acting and glorious music.  It certainly paints a different picture of Mozart than history had portrayed previously.  Entertaining.
0761169431|3.0|My son loves origami AND Star Wars with an unholy passion, so when we got him this book he was thrilled. The graphics are amazing, but the projects are just too hard, even for a kid who has gone to &#34;origami summer camp&#34; (I kid you not). Sooo, I'd say that it's great, but only if the parent is also a jedi-master origami folder, because it's tricky, tricky stuff.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|The cinematography in this is excellent! Daniel Craig brings a steeliness to the Bond character that Sean Connery never had.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I loved this app until the upgrade. now I keep getting &quot;check your network connection&quot; all the time.  My network connection is just fine-- it's the app that needs checking. Why couldn't you leave a perfectly good app alone?
B005PK56TA|5.0|Great show!!!! Full of unexpected twists and turns. Very twisted and somewhat scary.  Overall a very creepy and twisted! great series!
B0060CV498|3.0|I bought this for my 8 year old grandson. He loves it and watches it almost every time he comes for a visit.  It is not interesting to me.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|Increasingly challenging levels of play make this game addictive.  When first installed it, I couldn't stop playing.  If you like a challenge, try this app.
B00C7607FS|5.0|One of my favorite Disney movies of all time!! The quality of the picture is fabulous and I've listened to the soundtrack/sing along, included, a million times!!
B004SOR4H6|3.0|Okay, but I still rather go to the Twitter site and login and read the posts made by my friends and co-workers.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Kindle is a great way to doemload books and magazines it is just great. Amazon with kindle is the simplest way to go shopping and the e-books are the lowest prices
B0063M22QO|5.0|I'd never played mahjong before this. My daughter, who is somewhat skilled at the game, recommended I give it a try. She said it was fun, and to watch out...it's highly addictive! She was right!
B009HEMTXG|5.0|GOOD LESSON IN LIKING PEOPLE FOR WHO THEY ARE, NOT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE, AND BEING ABLE TO LOVE YOURSELF NO MATTER WHAT OTHERS THINK
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Helps me keep track of appointments and days that I am working. I wouldn't be without this app! Highly recommend it for anyone with a busy lifestyle.
B00FXES5WS|5.0|Susan Boyle's music is amazing as always.  I have been listening to this over and over - even before Christmas
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This is okay, but I find I can't regulate how my posts come up. I like to read my news feed as the most recent. It always comes up with their picks. Not something I will use. However, the program itself works good.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is awesome.  Very addictive.  Love it!  I watched my son and roommate play for hours.  Now I know why.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Makes viewing YouTube videos a snap on my Kindle Fire. I love being able to see the fun things on YouTube. Highly recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so entertaining and good clean fun for my nieces and nephews to play as well. a few glitches every now and then (I.e. freezing momentarily during the game) but its worth getting.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I could not get this to work on my tablet, although it was highly recommended. Even had someone else try to get it to work...no luck.
B0081ISUOG|2.0|Pretty basic and clunky. Have to use menu to access timer mode. Lots of visual issues like text spilling off screen. Doesn't even rotate with the phone.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Fast one clock searching on my tablet. I totally use Google for my search engine, and can't recommend this app enough!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I haven't had it but I should have lots of fun awesome I hop it's so so fun for me
B008AIGWVA|5.0|Dear grandson loves this app! Every time he comes over he has me show it to him. He especially loves the tickling part where Ben giggles!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Challenging game.  You can buy better weapons but you don't have to.<br />You can save up money by hunting and completing tasks
B00AHSLU2C|5.0|Kids love it, I love it i think the whole family loves it. Typical disney movie and fun to watch.
0321934318|5.0|Excellent instructional book with loads of information.  I find the book easy to understand.  I must say that there is so much information in the book that I will probably only use about 3/4 of it, but nice to know that everything is in a book you can go to later if you have any questions.<br />Visually very pleasant, good typo.  Not to mention the beautiful photo on the cover.<br />Scott Kelby has an excellent reputation with books....keep up the good work.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|My little one loves this movie and so does her older brother. Great family movie and I would highly recommend it.
B00866H7SS|4.0|I really enjoyed Gideon and Eva's star crossed lover romance, they definitely brought a lot of fire and tension to their relationship which meant you never could put the darn book down.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A book narrated by Death himself is certainly a step out of the ordinary.  The Book Thief is aimed at middle schoolers, and I bought it as a read for my daughter but was intrigued to read  it first myself to see how intense or upsetting it might be.  The examples of life, death, misery and persecution in suburban Munich are vivid and believable enough to make even a cynical tween pause and think.  Kids who &#34;get into the head&#34; of the characters in the books they read may be a bit troubled by this story, but those who can empathize with a character and possess enough maturity to separate themselves from the character will get a very good understanding of what things must have been like in those times.  My mother lived in Germany as a child of much the same age as the main character during this exact time period, and the experiences that she has described to me rang very true upon reading The Book Thief.  The author did his research well from what I can tell.  The plot is engaging enough to keep the reader coming back for chapter after chapter and Death's occasional commentaries do a nice job of breaking up what might otherwise become too intense.<br /><br />Bottom line - a good book for a thoughtful tween or young teen and an interesting read for anyone with an interest in or connection to to the times and events portrayed.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Love love love . Anna and Christian's story is always going to remain one of my favourites. Don't listen to the person who says that it's all just about sex, that's the boring part! It's that light that shines through these characters that does it for me!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Michael Buble's Christmas tunes are fantastic! His album is complete with multiple Christmas classics. We will enjoy these songs all through the Christmas season.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Always Excellent!  The songs are a great choice to add to your holiday music collection.  Susan has a broad range and uses it beautifully for the listener.
B007EECSFA|4.0|A bit too descriptive at times.  Immediately you fall in love with the characters.  An excellent story of love and loss.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|I loved the pace of this movie. It kept my interest throughout the entire film.<br />Very authentic content. I enjoyed it.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|My boy of 7 years old was very excited to receive this. But he was disappointed as the parts are too small for his clumsy fingers to really enjoying playing with it. I guess this is more of a collectable toy rather than for small kids.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|The most amazing book I have ever read it is so detailed and always kept me on the edge of my seat! I highly recommend this book as well as the other two catching fire and hunger games
B006ZL1KAW|5.0|I have look for several books related to meditation, but the book of Andy and its web site really changes my perspective and my life. It provides me a different a look of this life-practice and develops a new inside deep look into myself. The book is an extensión of the website, or a more detailed personal story telling. Do not expect a novel or guideline for mediation is more a closer look for the author and provide some extra clues and tips for meditation, Highliy recommend if you want to learn meditation seriously
B0015GDVTU|5.0|I got this for my wife for her birthday as it her favorite movie.  As soon as she got it she wanted to watch it.  We did and the quality was great.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I would say I love it, but honey, I'm 57 and have arthritis.  She kicked my bootie.  I'm going to have to try again.
B000NDMRCS|5.0|This movie is Brilliant I Love it!!! I have watched it over and over its exciting, Heart pounding, Funny, and somewhat scary at moments in the film... I borrowed the movie from a friend and when she took hers I had to get my own!!! 5 stars for me and kudos to the director.
1604680547|4.0|This book presents a nice variety of motifs for the hand or machine quilter,  both beginner and seasoned quilters will find motifs suitable for use in traditional or contemporary quilts. This book would make a good basic addition to any quilter's library.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun times!! great game but can slow down a little and mess you up. still lots of fun and great graphics
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have always enjoyed Solitaire, but this is the best one yet.<br />I am disabled, so there isn't much I can do. This is a great app for me. Thanks......
B00GH4R95C|5.0|Man of steel is a very good movie. I really injoyed it. HD quality and connection speed was good. I have no complaints.
B00005U8EM|5.0|Wanna know what Kaizen is?  Watch this.  Hilarious.  Touching.  Predictable ending - which I wanted.  The perfect metaphor for &#34;continuous improvement.&#34;  Oh, and a good story.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|the guy who plays the red skull, a Nazi, was the same guy who was Elrond in &#34;lord of the rings&#34;. it was funny to see him take on such a big switch in roles. but, they both are grumpy roles, I guess.<br />  there are some other really awesome things going on in this movie like a nearly unstoppable shield, the power of the gods, and disintegrater beam weopons .<br />  this movie has tie ins to the other movies with avengers in them. unlike the X- men movies which are put together all helter skelter these movies stay true to eachother.<br />  it would've gotten 5 stars except for 17, coutn em, 17 historical inaccuracies. they are mini skirts, flying cars, women officers in the military, t-shirts with pictures on them, robotic arms, handheld cameras, remote explosives the size of cell phones, one man rocket like submarines, low cut fronts on womens outfits, transponders with no antenna, Asian army soldiers, rotar propelled mimissles, knee length skirts in the military, one of the machine guns, a stealth bomber, mini rockets, and a wireless video camera.<br />  I really like this movie a lot. it is way better than the old captain America movie from the 80's although it was good too. chris evans totally pulls off a very believable captain America. he is a guy who is what every soldier wants to be, a guy you can believe in and a guy who instills patriotism in us all.
0743299795|5.0|'nuff said.  Except there is a minimum word requirement for reviews.  :-)  I recommend listening for the story behind the story.  Most people think Lean is about the methods and tools.  Not so.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I saw Serenity in theaters and it immediately gripped me in the way that only a great movie can. I've seen it many times since (it's great every time!) when I show it to friends and family.
B00005N9CV|5.0|She does a great job here. Singing the songs straight on without the affectations she sometimes has you can appreciate that she can really sing. Many great songs, Dancing in the Dark, Night We Called it a Day, Maybe You'll Be There among highlights.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|I thought the movie was average at best.  I had not ever read The Great Gatsby so really new nothing about the storyline.  Though the acting talent was superb, I found the movie itself rather boring.  There was never a point where I felt captured in the film & though I watched it in full, I would not do it again.  If I really like a movie I would buy it & watch it multiple times.  Overrated is my opinion of this one as I came into it with high expectations due to the classic story & actors playing in the movie.  Its worth a rental but I suspect you may be disappointed.
B00FN3HRG4|4.0|Just received the BackTo Brooklyn Concert CD/DVD in the mail yesterday. Although I am a true diehard BARBRA STREISAND fan I was a little disheartened to know this is not a true full concert program, but merely a spliced together package of the tour. High moments are her duets with her son and the showing of his film gift to her on her birthday, but missing is her Happy Days/Get Happy duet with her sister Roslyn Kind and the very telling witty banter between herself and Jason that was shown in snipets here and there on the internet. She's right to do what she wants and edit her own material the way she wants, and it's probably never enough for me as her fan, but I felt short changed a bit, by it. Certainly will keep it and not return it, but might not listen to it that frequently, knowing she will probably release another and call it the second night or the Israel leg of the tour in yet another marketing scheme. Ah, but the $$$ business never ends.
B00D2ZF3GQ|3.0|I just watched this movie & expected the worse after reading several reviews.  It was a feel good sci-fi that at minimum was entertaining.  I would not buy the film after seeing it but it was a good rental.  I am fairly simple to please & do not overanalyze movies so take that into consideration when reading this review.
B00125WAWS|5.0|I think students today need to understand the civil rights movement and how &#34;blacks&#34; were treated back in the day.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I like how he did a build up to the main story that spanned decades, by referencing who is president. The way he turned Danny into his dad with the alcohol and how he hit the 'the bottom' like his dad hit 'the bottom' when they hit that bike. The final confrontation between Dan and the True Knot was very well written and very easy to picture. Excellent book and is not a disappointment, it expands on the great book that is 'The Shining'!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Game is fun but pop up ads are annoying.  Trying to skip them is annoying as well.  Too bad.  It could have been much better.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Great movie. Not a chick flick. Guys like this movie too, even though they may not want to admit it.
B008JFUO72|1.0|Absolute trash. &#34;Iron Man 3&#34; mocked The Mandarin character, did not have a solid story, and was extremely boring (the few &#34;action&#34; scenes were towards the end of this pathetic movie). Since Drew Pearce wrote the story and this movie featured Guy Pearce as the main villain, I was expecting a worthy successor to the original, gold-standard &#34;Iron Man&#34;, but this movie was and is, as they say, an epic failure. Don't waste your time and money watching this piece of trash.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I have read all three books. The first one was the best. I found the second one a bit over dramatic and boring at times. This made it very difficult for me to start the third book. But eventually I found this one very entertaining. The only part I would had taken off wad the last two chapters of the book which honestly have nothing to do with the third book. All this writing could had been left in the first book.
B00FAI2IUM|1.0|The games good but the controls start inverted and you cannot fix it. So just get real racing 3 or something. I play this game upside down because it's easier.
B004H4XL7E|5.0|Impressive. Really well structured thinking. I took the keys themes and ideas and yep, I landed a pretty big deal (well, big for me). Really happy I read this book.
B00DU74U74|4.0|If you liked the book, you'll like the movie. I wasn't really expecting it to do the book justice, but I think they did a really great job! Things look like I expected and the characters are well represented. (Even though the script cut out my two favorite lines!)<br />If you didnt read the book, this is an excellent story! Its dystopic and critiques American society, all wrapped up in a beautifully addicting love story packed with adventure. It will make your heart ache in the best way possible.
B00CUIVGZS|5.0|These are long tunes with tons of excellent jamming. I really like the new guitar player. All the players are top notch and scary-good. It's been a long time since I heard a jazz album I've so thoroughly enjoyed. Chick Corea has really outdone himself this time. The tunes are memorable, mature and tastefully done. The jams fit the tunes and never sound gratuitous.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|VERY EXCITING!  Can't wait for season 2.  I only have one problem with it, I can't seem to figure out how to download it to my PC.
B00ED2EMJQ|5.0|I saw TYA on this tour and was blown away. At the time it was one of the best concerts I'd seen, and I've seen a LOT. So I wore out the vinyl version of this. Having nearly an hour of new material that never made it to vinyl or earlier CD packages is unbelievable for me. What took so long? The performances are flawless and as fresh as ever. This has always been my favorite TYA album. If you're only familiar with their studio albums, you owe it to yourself to get this. The band is obviously confident and in top form. Some of the long jams you won't recognize, but you'll want to hear them again and again. If you're a fan you'll notice this is not a greatest hits performance, but you'll be satisfied with the lengthy soulful perfomances. These guys love to play. This is an excellent recording, nearly studio quality.
1607107325|5.0|Oscar Wilde has long been a inspiration to me and this book was best suited for my type of caracter
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was so good. Suzanne, you are such a great writer it's not even funny!! I mean, I was so into this book, I actually thought I was in it!! Such a great writer!!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I think this game is great for all ages is the old one still on Facebook because I was at a high level on that one.but this one has a lot more quest that I like
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I couldn't  put it down but was a little bit disappointed with the ending!  Overall thoroughly enjoyable!!!!!  Love Stephen King!!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was good. Got me all tears eyed. Kinda funny. If used it after the hunger games, catching fire. Good job.
0761169431|4.0|I gave this book as a gift to my brother, and he ranked it 4 out of 5 stars.  The origami seems to be on the more challenging side (however my brother is just starting with origami), but it comes with star wars paper for each origami which was nice.
B003B02PFO|5.0|Guess skipping Christmas is easier said than done.  Feel good book, sometimes funny, sometimes sweet.  Proves the importance of family, and friends.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|Five Stars should I say more. Very good image quality I do not regret spending that money at all. Very please.
B001O8D47S|2.0|Meg Ryan and Annett and Bening had ZERO chemistry.  It was hard to get into the film because of this.  I think Meg Ryan was miscast and the scenes where they are trying to connect fell flat.  Julianne Moore would have been much better.  When it was the four of them together it was fun...the ending was the best part of the movie.  Disappointing that Jada Pinkett Smith's talent was wasted too.
1594202559|3.0|Not bad for a money book.  Fairly insightful into the personalities and dynamics in play in the hedge fund business.
1451666179|5.0|Love her blog and love her book!  Made me laugh like a crazy person while going thru chemo.  Brilliant, childlike, joyfully warped drawings that put a STOOPID grin on my face every time I look at them.  The only problem I have now is that I will spontaneously scream CAKE at the most inappropriate times (but that's a good thing in my book!).  Enjoy and eat CAKE!
B003UESJHE|5.0|This is an excellent movie and has a great amount of historical significance.  We have watched it several times and each time we discover something we had missed in the previous viewings.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|This is the best Macca CD in forever. The last one of his I really liked was Flaming Pie. And that had a lot of sadness in it because of Linda. This New is upbeat, catchy tunes, more like his old Beatles and Wings self. If you've been turned off by Paul's last few CD efforts, put those thoughts aside and get this one. If you liked Wings and his earlier solo stuff (and if you liked his work with the Beatles) I think you'll be happy with this CD.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|For me but if you are shopping for a little boy I would not get this game. I hope that my review was helpful.
1451695195|5.0|Well written easy to read, seems right on point. His story is very believeable. We'll still have to just wait and see.
1933492953|5.0|This is a great source of composition and image-making knowledge for any artist looking to improve their skills. This book contains plenty of visual stimulation as well to inspire anyone who has trouble coming up with ideas for picture making.
006178480X|5.0|Great Read for Science buffs.  I just love James Rollins.  He puts together great stories and challenges us to think and learn as we read.  At the end, he always tells us whats truth and whats fiction in the book.  Fascinating stuff!
086547897X|5.0|This is a must have book for any inspiring animator. It goes of basic and complex forms of animation. Things are clearly defined and described with plenty of visuals to carry the message.
0307271080|5.0|For those of us who actually grew up in Nigeria and moved to North America in our teens or twenties, the characters in this book were easy to relate to. The story itself started out slow and couldn't really get into it for the first couple of chapters. However things picked up. This book provided plenty to laugh and cry about, some very painful truths and characters that were real with very human flaws.<br /><br />A good read especially if you want to get a glimpse into the life of adult african immigrants who entered western countries as students
0786860707|5.0|This is one of those books that as an aspiring animators you need to have in your library. Written by the legendary artists, this book has comprehensive information on animation principles, techniques, stories, etc.<br /><br />I use this book for reference when animating. I also pair this book with The Animator's Survival Kit.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A book that captures the angst, passion, ambivalence, conviction, confusion, and mystery of adolescence...and perhaps the rest of life for that matter.  I appreciate writing that conveys that to which I can relate, even if I was an adolescent over 40 years ago.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Ok, I liked the book. Like the story, the writing, the pace, the ending. Then did a quick google search on the author and I will not buy anymore of his books. I may go look at the used bookstore in town - I can read the book without giving money to this man who would like others to abide by his religious and political preferences.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I can always count of Stephen King writing in a compelling way that enables me to relate to the human ordeal that his characters encounter in non-human experiences.  Stephen King is earthy, pithy, witty, and never one to mince words and ideas.  Once again, he delivers.<br /><br />True to the form that I perceive with most of his books, I found Doctor Sleep to build in intensity as the story progressed, and fizzle a bit at the end.  I don't read Stephen King for the endings as much as I read Stephen King to experience the way in which he captures the intensity of human feeling, thought, spirituality, interaction.<br /><br />Once again, he delivered.
1250012570|5.0|The book was a great choice for my daughter, it came packaged greatly and we both just love it! She already has another book coming from the same carrier.
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|This story was taken from Star Trek the Original Series and turned around where what happens to Kirk (TOS) happens to Spock (Into Darkness) and vice versa.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The actors are fantastic in their roles.  The action moves along nicely. Every actor and actress is completely believable in their foles.
B000OVLBFS|4.0|Tom Selleck can do no wrong.  His Jessie Stone series is his best yet and the stories get you very involved in his life.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I cannot project my home videos from my phone to my television? This is the main reason I purchased this device. I had to go and spend 4.99 on the play app which allows me to project my videos.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you for bringing CCS to Kindle! My only problem with this games is that lives end too soon and you either have to wait for more, buy them or incessantly bug your friends to give you more. King should consider increasing the number of lives every, say, five levels. It would bring joy to the people!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this game I wish it was the same s Facebook when you connect it would bring up your old g and and all the progress that has been made. I stopped playing on Facebook because it melted crashing but this version is fun to almost at level 21 and will be opening a new region can't wait to see what will happen and what kind of new challenges I would have to complete.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Good game, challenging scenes with different modes..only critique wishing they would reward you with token pieces you don't have instead of duplicates..
B009XIXVU6|4.0|As always this writers narratives are extremely well written  I found it a bit confusing the jumping between times and characters.  I think it would help while reading it to make a list of the characters and their relationships and some type of time line.  This would be especially helpful if you will be reading the book over a course of time (any more than a few days).  The story was very interesting the writing excellent but overall the timelines and characters were confusing.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|This book had such a huge sense of depth and character, I would loose track of time while reading it! And the point of view of the story was changing with nearly every chapter which gave an amazing outlook on the story. Action wise, I couldn't have found a better book...A must read!
B00EQ0CKRQ|2.0|The first few games were really cool but after awhile, it crashes! Then came the additional download for updates on this app and it crashes more...kindle fire hd can't handle this one...the best thing i made on this game was...I've uninstalled it! Good riddance...back to real racing 3 where I finally got the ferrari and prosche updates!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Im a console gamer and when im not playing ACIV im playing DragonVale. Bunch of dragons to breed or buy. *Note every dragon is breedable. You dont need to spend money at all. If you enjoy time based games that you can enjoyably play periodically during the day or play for half an hour straight then download this now.
B00GH4R95C|1.0|Purchased it in HD, but HD didnt work. Had to watch it in SD, but only watched small part of it. In SD picture ok, but sound was poor.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a great product. Simple to install and use, works great with my Samsung tablet and Netflix. Just plug it in and start watching, it's that simple.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a very fun game. The one thing I would change is to have a girl without blue hair that shirt doesn't show her stomach.
B0060V1WJ6|1.0|This was Hollywood crap at it's finest. What a waste of some good actor's talent. Like a train wreck in slow motion.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love having this option on my phone even though I have a kIndle.  I can read books when I have my phone and not have my Kindle with me.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|It lived up to the hype.  The villains were a nod to &#34;Old&#34; Doctors, Easter Eggs abounded, and, like &#34;The Three Doctors&#34; of days gone by, the three Doctors of this event were a joy to watch in concert. Well worth the watch.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I got this idea to get this game from my friend it looked dumb but it's the best game in the world
006202406X|1.0|After an astonishing 1st and 2nd book I was in love with this series. I was excited and anxious to read the 3rd book but when I did I was thoroughly disappointed and I know from the other reviews and friends who have also read the book that I'm not the only one. Veronica Roth ruined this series with Allegiant. The whole plot was odd and dissatisfying and the ending was unfinished and also very hard to read due to emotions. I didn't expect there to be a perfect happy ending, but this book definitely did not reach my expectations and was not worth waiting more than a year to read.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|Complex but likable characters -  fascinating balance among intrigue and lying and deceit. For me a love story thinly masked by the machinery and bureaucracy of the workings of the British Security Services. If I had money enough, I would find the producers to make this movie - perhaps I'd even be given the joint to support  Mr.  McEwan with small rewrite tasks to include bringing him his tea. Marvellous book - every page.
B00CWR4YCE|2.0|Not very long, just patterns, no photos. I would not recommend it to anyone. Wish I had not purchased it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This was an excellent finale to an exciting and thought provoking series. The author doesn't take what would necessarily be the reader's choice. I highly recommend this series for all ages.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Riveting!  I would lay it down and walk away, but just had to keep coming back and picking it up!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is so addictive its a really good road trip game I totally think you should get this app!!! oh by the way I'm 20 years old
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie, and it was great to be able to watch it before going to see Catching Fire. Thank you Amazon.
B003G4W49C|4.0|easy read, although I dislike the nonsense premise of the rules of the fictional society - five more words required (this is stupid amazon rules for comments)
0062238868|2.0|Not really what you would expect from a book with this title.  Don't really know what the guy was getting at.  I guess we'll never know now.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Because this is my favorite trilogy and that is why I chose 5 stars. So Suzanne you are my favorite author.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love it. Works like a charm. Would recommend to anyone anyone wanting a cheap easy to use battery app. :)
B0009P5YXO|5.0|My son loves it - he used it for his Dr. Who Halloween costume and has played with it since then.
B009B8YZKS|4.0|Liked it, but mostly because it reminded me of Ender's Game.<br /><br />Which I highly recommend, in comic book form especially
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Not perfect, and not the best of del Toro's films, but good fun.  Certainly worth the rental, and a perfect summer movie.
0767836324|2.0|Rarely has such film talent been so wasted.  Even the acting genius of Maggie Smith, Dustin Hoffman and Bob Hoskins could not salvage this shallow film. Steven Spielberg relies too much on grotesque slapstick, and ends up with a maudlin &#34;made for the Holidays&#34; film.
B002BEJ3BK|5.0|This is one of my favorite Roots albums. Great songs from start to finish. And the songs on vinyl sound great as always.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this app a lot. It was great to pass the time. I can't wait for more levels to be added!
B000TERJG0|5.0|Great Album highlighting some new versions of old songs, as well as a great collection of songs not found on other albums.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|It's Breaking Bad.  I know I don't have to explain more than that.  Completes my collection of one of the most well-written, best-acted, twisty shows I have seen.  Sniff, sniff.  Sad to see it's over.....
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I downloaded the game for my little sister. She was happy with it and so was I. But when it came time to upgrade it, the app in the Appstore kept malfunctioning. I was very displeased. Now she can't have the winter updates.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Enjoyed it with my daughter. We both enjoyed it watching it together. Laughter with someone close to you give you both quality times. Good plot and action. The colors were outstanding in this one.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I LOVE this album, love Lady Gaga because she exposes feminine grit. At first I thought it was all about her, and was prepared to give it a thumbs down. Then I listened to the whole album and I GOT it. I always see the message of the artist, it's part of how I participate in the whole artistic process, by being an observer. She's gritty, she's dynamic and I adore all the songs except for DOPE. Don't like it. What I love is how she celebrates the feminine and the goddess in all women. The song Applause is what we all reach for, that acceptance and how we combat the fears within to get to the applause. Brilliant!
0143122916|5.0|This book tells us about what life is like in a north korean prisoner camp in second person. It's feeled with mixed emotions, horror, confusion, andger, and andguish. Yet in all in the midst of the mysterious prisoner camps, one person escaped and told his story-and his story is told right here.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|Was considering downloading this app, but won't because of the lack of respect for privacy on the part of this company. In my opinion, there is absolutely no reason that anyone should be required to give out personal information esp without our express knowledge and permission!!! What a load of crap!!! In my opinion this app doesn't deserve any stars above the one required. Thanks everyone for the reviews and warnings, I won't be downloading ANYTHING from this company.
B00881PTRC|3.0|Fun game to burn a few minutes between whatever! It is simple to start playing, yet is fun enough to keep your attention for a while. Good game to play in the waiting room or etc.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This is a fantastic story.  It illustrates the power of love, courage, faith and perseverence, a life lesson, The name of the movie tells it all.
B00FHB7398|5.0|I played on my 1st generation kindle fire. There is a lag time between scenes so I was glad someone else's review let me know. I thought the story. was unusual and really enjoyed it. The spiders were a cleaver idea. I liked the mixture of hog's and puzzles. I don't like the music in the games so I turn it off. I liked the video in the journal so that I could turn the music back on and hear the conversation and\or hear all that took place and then turn it off again. I really like Big Fish games.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like the game it is fast and wont frezze on you. you should really get this game. it is a lot if fun
B00G3HSF7O|2.0|Visually interesting, but lacking in a strong story, Elysium is a movie that I want to like but can't recommend. Set one hundred and fifty years in the future, the plot is essentially a class struggle between the haves of Elysium and have nots of Earth. While Matt Damon does a fine job in his role as Max, and while the individual actors are plausible, there is no real chemistry between them. I wanted to like this film, but it is mediocre at best. Grade: B-/C+
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|Wow, what a beautiful story and movie. My wife and I sat down to watch this and we both fell in love with the animation, the voice acting, and the perfect music. This movie perfectly captures those youthful days of tentatively reaching out to your first love and hoping against hope that the other person responds in kind. Another great masterpiece by Studio Ghibli!
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Challenging. Enjoyable. I dont care for the social network stuff or the extra costs but fun otherwise. Got to level ten so far. now more difficult.<br />!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|best read ever.....Will SAVE your marriage! Recommend for any engaged, newly weds or older couples. I was amazed at what I read, wished I had read it for my first marriage
B00GLOVLTI|1.0|I'm not buying any more movies from Paramount unless they list all of the extras as well as those they are not including in this version.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|A dark sided DC story is an awesome story<br />I like light hearted items in DC but having batman seem more dark is a love!
B00F7AP5T4|1.0|Caveat Emptor. I only chose to buy this version of the film because of the way that Paramount split up the extras. This one had &#34;Best Buy&#34; exclusive content. After jumping through a couple of hoops to get Best Buy's movie player, the movie won't play and I get the messages &#34;the license cannot be found&#34; and &#34;try again later&#34;. What did happen is that I started to get phishing email after I downloaded their player. So I'm going to cut my losses, delete the Best Buy movie player, and get stuck with another basic version of the movie. I hope that Paramount releases a version with FULL extras. Now, right or wrong I feel that they owe me for the price of two movies. I am totally displeased.
B00DUCXFUC|5.0|I love the book..the movie...EVERYTHING.<br /><br />I put the 3 models at work on my desk :)<br /><br />But got ticked today because a coworker brought her daughter in and I wasn't in at the time. But when I got there she was playing with all 3 of them. Do you know how hard it was not to get ticked lol.<br /><br />But this is a must buy and worth every penny for any avid Batman lover.
B00ESNE696|5.0|Love, love, love this show.  My favorite show of all time.  I absolutely refuse to miss it. Fantastic show to watch.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|A dark sided DC story is an awesome story<br />A dark sided DC story is an awesome story<br />I like light hearted items in DC but having batman seem more dark is a love!<br />Best part is &#34;I want you to remember I was the one who beat you&#34;<br /><br />Had me so hype!!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|This books reads like it was written by the author's distant relative twenty years after book 2. It's disconnected, poorly paced and written without care. It's the opposite of the first two Hunger Games. It's a loathsome chore to read.<br /><br />Perhaps there is a good story here, but it's buried beneath pages of exhausting, meaningless exposition and endless whining. This is clearly some kind of first draft. Hopefully they hire a competent editor to take a machete to the text before its next edition.<br /><br />Despite my words, if you are a fan of the first two books, you WILL read this one. I suggest either finding someone else to summarize the book for you, or waiting for the movie. It surely won't be worse than the book.
B005LAIHR2|1.0|Waste of time. A very crappy story built around a bunch of random songs. I saw this for free and still felt ripped off.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Excellent game, very interesting and at Time challenging just a shame it takes so long to recharge, not good for impatient people
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Wow! Great story that brought back so many fond memories from my younger days. Easy Read, Really Enjoyed this Book!!!
0394818237|5.0|only the best book ever!  I read this when I was a kid and was delighted to buy this for my son.  I was sad to see  that the only version you can get now is abridged, but happy to see that my favorite stories are even in the abridged version.  I love Richard Scarry's attention to process and detail.  reading the story about going on a airplane trip was especially helpful for my son as we were preparing to travel.  he knew what to expect and was excited to talk about all the different parts of the plane shown in the book.  this is a go-to gift for 3 and 4 year old birthdays!
B003Z0BWT0|5.0|i loved it! i just couldnt put it down i was very happy with the way that it ended was not dissapointed
B004T0E2S8|5.0|name any band and any song  You can play it!  Impressive app! :)  easy to use, easy to navigate and clean
0843135018|5.0|Little Miss Tidy is a funny character, she is our daughter's favorite! We love British children's literature and the Little Miss and Mr. Men books are no exception. Great story lengths for our almost 3 year old, and more importantly, good morals.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I used to have this game on my I pad until my sister got into it and changed the language. I got a kindle fire and the first game I got was this. I like how you get to do all the cool pioneer stuff. The only problem I have is the energy. You only for 24 and everything you do uses it. You then either have to buy more, or wait 2 minutes for each free one. It is a good thing though so you aren't glued to it and can do other things while you wait for more. All in all though, I absolutely love love love this game. I would really recommend this. I haven't had any problems ever since I got it.  If you like Pioneer things and all Thoes games with towns and things, you would like this.
0399230033|5.0|Our daughter loves Good Night. Gorilla. It has a limited number of words, I think it's mostly good night...but I love hearing her explanation on what's happening in the book. They have changed a bit over the past year.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I Love the challenge. I can never wait to the next board to see what's next it makes me HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY. LOL
084313349X|5.0|We love British children's literature and the Little Miss and Mr. Men books are no exception. Great story lengths for our almost 3 year old, and more importantly, good morals.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Good game. Difficulty level is spot-on. Good for most age groups. Not too graphic but enough to know you're shooting things.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This is fun to play<br />You should get this game to be a great deal of time I would be enough to ring the door
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved this series! I've read it three times, all three books and it never gets old! The plot is fascinating and the story never gets dull or dry, the reader is kept engaged the whole time!
B003O86FMW|5.0|THIS IN MY OPINION IS THE BEST BOOK OF THE SERIES IT REALLY TELLS YOU HOW STRONGLY KATNISS AND PEETAS FEELING ARE.THE FIRST BOOK WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTING IN THE ROMANTIC ASPECT BECAUSE KATNISS WAS REALLY CONFUSED ABOUT HIM.THIS BOOK MAKES IT CLEAR HOW MUCH SHE LOVES PEETA. THE ENDING WAS EXCITING BUT SAD. I DON'T LIKE GALE WITH KATNISS. HE ACTUALLY DOES SEEM LIKE A COUSIN TO HER. WHO WOULDN'T LOVE PEETA ESPECIALLY KATNISS I MEAN WHO WOULD ACTUALLY DIE FOR YOU WOW SUCH A GREAT BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS WAS ALSO THE ONE BOOK THAT I REREAD LIKE 10 scenes because of the humour the romance or because you really had to read it again to say wow that was clever!!!
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game is so slow to start and so social media orientated and the pop ups are anoying when playing makes it even slower.
B000WCDBKM|5.0|Well done movie though it is an older one. If you haven't seen this movie it worth you watching it.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I like it but my only problem is that every time I get all his pieces and he is left with his king, it's like 4 moves and it`s stalemate but when he gets all my pieces, I never get stalemate. Unfair!
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|Galactic Energies by Luca Rossi  is a great book! I started out excited for one reason, lost that and got excited for different reasons.<br /><br /> I really liked the combination of science fiction with erotica. The concepts are great but they are the executions that really bring those to life.<br /><br /> I felt compassion and shame. I felt excited. This story really moved me. The stories are immediately gripping and frighteningly real. I was hooked from cover to cover!<br /><br />This book will change you.<br /><br />5 stars and can't wait to read more from this author
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Julia Swahala gives a spirited performance as the determined &#34;Miss Lane,&#34; whose heart was broken many years before by the conventions of social norms, when she could not marry the landed gentleman, &#34;Sir Timothy.&#34;  As Candleford's postmistress, Miss Lane is at the center of Candleford's joys and sorrows and the class conflicts with the nearby impoverished community of Lark Rise. Interesting story-lines with well developed characters all around.
1401233791|5.0|This is a well written story for batman. I couldnt put the book down. This is the best book in the the knightfall collection.
B0034DGPEU|2.0|A compelling read on an extremely depressing subject. No attempt is made to sugar coat the brutality and cruelty of the era-and I dont enjoy reading about helpless people.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game makes my daughter feel like she is on a real horse! This is a perfect game for anyone, even adults! This is my daughter's favorite game!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|this game is great but there is one thing they don't have that much world's so what to spend your money ( if you have a kindle fire get the game free it will give you the full version
B00FAI2IUM|3.0|When you go check out the FAOTD you expect to get a FREE paid app. Now, not only is the FAOTD free every other day, I don't see anything in the game that would make it special to make it worthy to be FAOTD.<br /><br />I hate to write a review like this because it's a good looking game but everything you have to pay money for when it's not the FAOTD you still have to pay for.  Unless that's been changed and I just don't know what to do to get the upgrades without real money in which case, if I find out the change I'll gladly up the review and update what I said. But if there is something you gotta do special to unlock those upgrades and they have to be done today, November 27 and I don't find out until it's too late I'm gonna be pi$$ed off that it wasn't put in the description.<br /><br />Since when do ad-filled free games make it to Amazon's FAOTD. I'm just still in shock over that.<br /><br />Otherwise, if you can get past a game that is almost a gig in size, it's a beautiful game to play once you get used to the steering weirdness. It'd be worth 4 or 5 stars outside the above and I'm being real generous with the 3 only because of the way the game looks. Otherwise it'd be a 1, 2 at the most. I'm sorely disappointed Amazon. I'd rather have the apps others complain about other than apps loaded with adware :(
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|How hard this game is. Awesome. Let's play papoyyyyyy.<br />I love that Dave is the first minion to play with. Cool
B009ZQRS2I|3.0|It's a fun and fairly well made for it's budget, which I'm guessing is low. It's a bit of a mind bender, and that is it's greatest strength. It's a bit gooey and bio-gross, but not over the top. If you like Science Fiction and are just looking to blow some time, Existenz is a good fit.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Great game. Very fast pace. Good for everyone even mature people to help keep brain power going at top speed. A must for everyone
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|A short, easy read. Much like Sanderson's other books,  he immerses the reader in a unique world. Simply brilliant work.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love despicable me and this game is just a bonus for all the despicable me lovers out there. You won't be disappointed by this game period<br />This is one of the most entertaining games ever!
B009NF54ZE|4.0|Fun little &#34;time-waster&#34;. Not overly hard - not really a &#34;hidden objects&#34; game as I expected but I'll play it through for the fun of it. Not much replay value. Got it as a FAOTD. Not sure I'd pay full-price for it.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's a good game, a little time consuming though. You have to feed the horse, groom it, and clean paddocks to be able to show.
B007R11DKQ|4.0|The movie was entertaining though a bit scattered, but considering its a fantasy the scattering is not too distracting.  Michelle Pfieffer and Robert Dinero was fun to watch
B008JFUPFI|5.0|Man of Steel presents the story of Superman in a fantastic way !!! I watched the TV show when Reeves did the role, it was good back in the day, however, this one exceeded my expectations !!! Henry Cavill does ' Great Justice ' to the role and the entire movie is OUTSTANDING ! A must have for all fans of Superman !!!
B008PZZV8S|3.0|Odd movie, the character of Ripley is portrayed, as it should be, by Matt Dillon, a disturbed and psychotic individual living on the edge...I know the movie was meant to be different but it seemed to never get focused.  Still it was okay and worth watching
B0021L8V0M|5.0|SALT is a VERY INTERESTING MOVIE !! If you like action, suspence, and a very &#34; Hot Performance &#34; by Angelina Jolie...then you have got to get this movie !!!
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|There was a lot of love given to this movie. For the life of me I can't see why.  Besides the fight scenes (which are pretty cool) the rest is awkward to watch and , even within the realm of sci-fi, very contrived.
B004A8ZX28|5.0|This movies title is very true... really like Liam Neeson and the movie has more twists in the plot that a grand prix race course. If you like suspence and a multi layered plot...THIS MOVIE IS A MUST HAVE !
B000FBJAOG|5.0|What else is there to say that hasn't been said already. If you're interested in the practical day-to-day of surviving the Zombieland then buy this book and read it.  It might save your life!
B006GWO5NE|2.0|The cord does not work properly. Usually the line will work a couple of times then stop. This time it didn't work right from the start. I have to jiggle the line until the light comes on. It's frustrating.
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|The profanity from John Goodman's character...off the charts, in a negative way.  If someone talked that way in my house, I would throw them out.  Amazing. He probably is potty trained at one end, his mouth should receive it at the other end. My opinion and I'm entitled to it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have read this year. Sure to be a major motion picture, if not something is wrong with Hollywood.
B00555X8OA|4.0|I love the voice of Daniel Kahneman, great facts and super engaging style.  I find this very helpful for the work I do in a residential treatment program for adolescent girls.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|Nothing like good old Jefferson Airplane to bring me back to the good old days!  I remember this album when I was growing up, actually have the album but bought the CD.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This was very entertaining, easy to follow and a good story, but not for me.  It never grabbed me like people told me it would.  Maybe because it was for younger adolestants.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|One of the most thrilling shows on TV. I had to keep watching, now I'm hooked on almost all BBC  shows.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Only because I get stuck for days!  Yes it is fun, frustrating and great. just wish I could get unstuck.
0345803493|5.0|I loved this book most out of the series. This was definitely my fave! Deeper into the Love story. And a more favorable side of Christian and more drama!!!
B00GLX0Z8C|5.0|Enjoyed the movie, Very Funny! Jennifer Aniston is a FOX!  She is like a fine wine, gets better with age.
B00E38KGF4|4.0|So far it seems to be doing a nice job and it doesn't take too long to scan! I have only had it for a few days .
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It is a very fun game and keeps me entertained for hours. It is a lil unrealistic but very fun for non hunters
B00G32OER4|4.0|My rating really depends on how you feel about having the s*** scared out of you. I am a teen, a female, the male name on here is my dad's. I went to see this movie and haven't been able to go to sleep at all. The script and actors are too good! :) My sister, who saw the movie with me, slept with me and she is five years older than me. My dad however, didn't even flinch, through the entire thing. Our heads were buried behind him and are eyes would always wander to the screen to see what happened next...... I know am an even stronger believer of ghosts. Gosh, just thinking of the movie, makes me want to go under my bet comforter. So basiclly, I recommend this movie for thrill seekers. I always shut my closet door tight, and can't handle the sight of wardrobes. There is a closet under the stairs at my house and it has a creepy tunnel under it and I can't even go near the closet. Again, I bear you warning!
1476727651|5.0|Great sequel to The Shining!  I know some people have found it to be boring, but I thought it was one of King's better novels!  And without so much of the craziness as some of his real 'horror' stories.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quite a pleasant distraction and pleasing soundtrack (albeit noticeably repetative); nice attention  to details 1 2 3 4 5 6
B009UWYFFK|3.0|Hotel Transylvania was an ok family movie - the kids loved it, but the only thing I can really say made an impression was thinking that the guy doing the voice for the possessed airplane pilot should have been doing the voice for Dracula - he knocked it out of the park.  Adam Sandler just sounds like Adam Sandler, only more croaky.
B00633W614|4.0|I loved the 1st book in the chronicles and enjoyed this one but it was too short.  I read it too fast and now I need to read the next one. Great books though.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I never knew about the orphan trains.  Although this is a fictional accounting, I'm sure that it could be absolutely true.  I went out and read more about the real orphan trains and this novel rings true to many of the stories of these orphans.  How sad that so many children went through this and only one generation removed.  These kids had stamina and courage beyond what most of us could even imagine.  I recommend this piece of American history to everyone!!!!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love love love this game it's very addictive and amazing this is the number one app of all besides frontline commando but very great
B005LAIHCM|5.0|I love this movie! It isn't really scary, but the plot twist is amazing! Overall great movie! I would recommend this to a friend!
B000059XUO|5.0|My wife just loves this movie and Brandon & Bruce Lee in general. I kind of like it myself as well.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Really useful app. I use it for organizing recipes. I canine as much space as need. Very nice, would recommend it.
B00FATEJYE|1.0|When I downloaded this it stopped installing and started downloading again somebody help its wasting<br /> lost of my space!!!! Some one please help Amazon needs to put a cancel button now it's just wasting my space Amazon help me remove this any body !!!!!!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is beyond words, I've read it a couple times now and it just keeps getting better and better!
B00FHATBGW|5.0|I found this one difficult to put down. Plenty of criptic puzzles and H/O scenes and the story was engaging.  As with most of the games from Big Fish it had top notch graphics and played smoothly on my first gen.Kindle fire. Not overly expensive and it took more than a single sitting to finish so you get a good value for the money.
B00AFWEPVI|5.0|I actually haven't used this app very much. Wil get to it around these Holidays, Looking forward to using it though.
B00BDAP66E|4.0|this app has a few glitches but it needs a few work on the manager thing.I Used it. Using on Kindle fire is kinda fun.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game!! Im not all in to the blood and stuff but its not that bad. But on thing is tat t says you can get a Megladon shark but you cant. The biggest one you can get is a great white. But overall its a good game
1400082773|1.0|In his new book &#34;Public Enemy,&#34; Bill Ayers confesses to being the real author of &#34;Dreams From My Father.&#34;  Obama, apparently, has neither the brains  nor the temperament to write his own autobiography.  The publisher should withdraw the book and put the right author on the title page.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|One of my all-time favorites. Makes me think. Its fast moving. I love that it is not a long game and i compete with myself. Computer graphics AWESOME.
B009V0TV6O|4.0|It's a good app that goes over 300 bpm.  The design could be a bit better and it only works in landscape mode.  I use it a lot to tap out speeds of songs and to set rhythm.
B004HO6HWK|5.0|The Mechanic  not to be mixed up with the Charles Bronson version, it has some similarities with original the story. It has  great action  scenes, and a great story line, the cast  Jason Stratham as The Mechanic  and Ben Foster as his apprentice do a wonderful job of drawing you into this  fast moving action  movie, a must  get DVD or Blu-ray to add to your collection
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was my first Stephen king book that I've read and I found myself completely sucked into it. Kept me wanting to just keep reading and to see what happens next. Instant classic in my mind and may even read it twice.
B008Z9L94O|3.0|I bought this on wax when it was first release, like when it originally came out. I sold that copy for over $400 on eBay 5 years ago. Cool story, huh?
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Susan Boyle brings a new sound to the old classics.  The duets with Elvis Presley and Johnny Mathis are a nice addition.  I am a real fan of Susan Boyle, and she did not disappoint me with this Christmas CD.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great story that reads very quickly.  You come to really feel for Ender and his pain!  I was sad that the book ended and I had  to leave.
B000FC0P9E|5.0|This is a very good book. I had actually read the paperbook when it first came out but wanted to read it again so now I have it on my kindle so I can read whenever I want. The first time I read it all the way through without putting it down!
B000HKYOK0|5.0|great classics! Spock, Captain Kirk, Scotty, and others always worth watching again and again.  Highly recommend.  Great to sit and watch all afternon!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent book.  Original plot, nice twists in story, definitely leaves you wanting more!  Can't wait to read what comes next!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Daniel Craig may be the best James Bond yet.  He is the most realistic and is haunted by his past.  This movie gives a glimpse of his relationship to &#34;M&#34; and introduces a the new &#34;Q&#34; and other characters we will see in future movies.  &#34;Q&#34; and Bond have a funny back and forth confession due to Q's age which fits due to Q's young age which makes since in today's world.  A terrific villain and non stop action along with just enough gadgets make it the best movie since Casino Royale (2006).
B000UNYK3A|3.0|Not many deleted scenes...no extra gore...nothing much in Directors cut of interest over the original release sorry not that good
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Awesome movie!<br />It is one that I will watch many times and I would recommend this movie.<br />It captures your attention the whole movie.<br />Fantastic graphics.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was a great story and an awesome trilogy!  I am glad I read this!  I really loved the ending !!
B00009AOBI|5.0|I get teary eyed every time I see this movie, it is fabulous!<br />Cher is outstanding in this movie and so is Sam Elliott.<br />I have seen this movie so many times and I just don't get tired of it.<br />Based on a true story.
0451169514|5.0|Son said that this book was very good.<br />Looks like this book had only been read once.<br />The seller said book in very good shape.
B008JFURKG|3.0|the sound format was not good enough the movie first was in dts, this movie was only done in dolby digital
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|So once again everyone I know is playing the new levels on their devices except me. Why does amazon take so long to put the updates out? I have been checking for the update everyday since the new level was released and still nothing.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|It is so fun. I recommend it to EVERYONE. It is really cool and it keeps me entertained for HOURS
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Fun game to pass the time with. Unlockables both for and from the console game are a bonus and add a new dimension to the game.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Best book I have ever read could not put it down!! So emotional in many parts. Was written so well
B001NLL8LA|5.0|The high water mark of the Jack Reacher series, in my opinion.  Unfortunately, I started with this one so every other book in the series has suffered by comparison.  This book has everything - including one of the most memorable female characters in all fiction.  I don't think that anything else Lee Child has written - and he's had some good stuff - even comes close to Gone Tomorrow.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love the storyline so much that I read the trilogy within 5days. Can't wait to be mind blown with the movie..
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|Unless you're just beginning with the Jack Reacher series, you should probably skip this one.  It took Child several more books before he got his formula right.  This story is unimaginative (compared to later works) and redundant - how many short car rides need to be described in detail?  So, unless you just want to be able to say that you've read them all............
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game. Hours of fun
B007HO392S|5.0|Love Carrie Underwood.  My ballards are my favorite.  She's a wonderful singer.  Looking forward to her next cd.  Order it.
B00ERIUO02|4.0|It's a solid album! Not pop perfection, but it is a nice record to listen to. I bought the standard edition because I'm not a big Katy fan, but I am willing to support her! I'm more than positive that this album's popularity will not last as long as Teenage Dream's 2 year chart domination did. It is not her best album, but it is still nice. Some songs are a bit boring in my opinion, especially the last 4 songs, but I'm sure there are people that like that soft and personal side of Katy. Overall, I did enjoy it and I am looking forward to this Prism era.<br /><br />Roar- It is a bit too Disney for me, but nonetheless it is very catchy and the lyrics are sure to inspire children from ages 5-13. The music video is trash and I don't think it deserved to top the hot 100's.<br /><br />Legendary Lovers- I've noticed that not a lot of people like this song as much as I do, but wow this song is amazing! I love the dark tone of the song I also love the beats, her voice, and the melody of the song! It is my favorite song on this album, I would love to see a video for this song.<br /><br />Happy Birthday- This song is cute! Also one of my favorites. It is very Mariah Carey inspired which I really enjoy. I also love it's disco inspired beats, solid song.<br /><br />Walking On Air- It's very 90's house music inspired, songs like &#34;I'm Every Woman&#34; by Whitney Houston, &#34;Ray Of Light&#34; by Madonna, and &#34;Believe&#34; by Cher remind me of this song. It's not my cup of tea, but a lot of people will undoubtedly have fun with this record.<br /><br />Unconditionally- This song grew on me, it's a decent song but I don't think it should have been the 2nd single. But it's very impacting and it can relate to any type of love, such as love for a child, a lover, a sibling, etc.<br /><br />Dark Horse- Wow this song made me realize how talented Katy is! This song is also one of the best songs on the album, I love it's dark tone, it's hip hop beats, and the chorus is so impacting!I think this song should have been the 2nd single, it's a guaranteed hit.<br /><br />This Is How We Do- I like this song! It's very fun and cheerful, it definitely makes you want to dance and party. It reminds of a song Kesha would sing, but it fits Katy as well so I don't think it was a rip off.<br /><br />International Smile- This is my 3rd favorite song. The part that gets to me is the chorus! It's very catchy and it's very early Katy Perry. The songs reminds me of fashion, excellent!<br /><br />Ghost- This song is ok, it's very nice to listen to once in a while. It is catchy and it's sweet.<br /><br />Love Me- I can honestly do without this song, but it is catchy. Most of these songs are catching but can get old quick.<br /><br />This Moment- I don't know why, but this song reminds me of something that can fit Teenage Dream. It's an ok song, the chorus is the best part of the song.<br /><br />Double Rainbow- Out of the last 5 songs on this album, this is my favorite! It's very sweet and inspiring, I'm glad Katy is giving her fans something to feel inspired to, rather than advising them to get drunk in songs such as &#34;Last Friday Night.&#34;<br /><br />By The Grace Of God- This is probably my least favorite song on this album, I think it is a horrible closer for an album, it ends on a boring note. But I appreciate that people find this song impacting and help them with life issues. Don't get me wrong, the song is not bad, it's just not a song I really pay attention to. It is her most personal song ever.
0783114893|1.0|I'm surprised I saw so many four and five star ratings for this movie.  I liked all of the actors and thought they did a great job, especially Rutger Hauer, but so many things about this movie just didn't make sense.  Some are small errors that could be forgiven but too many were just totally unbelieveable.<br /><br />For instance, at one point a cop accidentally shoots the tire of another cop car and this somehow causes BOTH cars to magically flip over.  Completely ridiculous.  Later Hauer's character shoots down a helicopter, with a handgun no less, and it fortuitously lands on a speeding cop car, which then somehow causes the other two cop cars to crash as well.  And of course the part near the end when Hauer's character manages to take down three armed cops and escape from the prisoner transfer bus, all while shackled.  How was he able to do this?  We'll never know because they don't actually show it, probably because the people who made this movie knew that it made no sense and chose to gloss over it.<br /><br />Most of the other low-star reviews make reference to the transfer quality but this was not an issue with my copy of the DVD.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a great game if you are bored or need something to do. It's a great game to get you thinking! I give it a solid 4 stars!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|ii Gave This Game A 5. This Is A Magnificent Game. When Ever You Are Bored. Just Click On Candy Crush Saga!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book is catching a lot of crap, but I really enjoyed the alternate POV's! I enjoyed being more in Tobias' head. He was always a little confusing as far as his feelings were concerned, so reading his actual thoughts was really fun for me. I do think she could have made Tris' discovery of everything a little more dramatic. Her brother being saved, finding out all the info on her mom, etc. It was like &#34;Oh wow, my mom is a complete stranger now....oh well.&#34; Other than that, I liked it a lot. Finally understanding the reasoning behind all the unrealistic cities run by factions was awesome! Can't wait for the movie!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Lol I didn't even realize it ended ! Beautifully written . Honestly, i like it because it puts into words everything all I believe in. Its beautiful. Just read it.
B00F91H15W|1.0|No story line. No character development. It feels like just scenes put together to create a movie. Do not bore yourself to watch this film!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Best game ever played!!!! I've seen the movie n stuff the game is just as good as the movie is!!!! :-)
0762445262|4.0|Cute gift for a Batman fan, but it needs to be within 3feet of the wall to see the image
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its super cool and I love it and I hope you love it to and I really recommend it to buy so you should love it have fun and enjoy
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really like this game. A lot like subway surfers. I would definitely recommend this game to every one. And it's free so it's not like you wasted your money.
B005JZBP8W|5.0|Great transfer, as good as you ever saw it on the big screen.  A classic, done right.  And yes, she's wonderful . . .
B00BEIYMAG|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />The main problem with a movie like “The Conjuring” is that it assumes that none of us have ever been to a haunted house movie before (perhaps not an entirely unwarranted assumption given that the characters in these movies clearly never have or they‘d know better than to move into one of these houses in the first place).<br /><br />You know the drill. Unsuspecting family from the city buys an old place in the country. Weird things begin to happen. Ghostbusters are brought in to investigate. Turns out some restless spirits, the victims of various ghastly crimes in the past, are roaming around the place searching for someone to free them from their predicament so they can move on and find eternal peace. Supernatural pandemonium ensues. Roll credits. The End.<br /><br />This one is set in 1971 (the girls are watching “Brady Bunch“ reruns in the middle of the afternoon long before the show ever went into syndication, but then I doubt that facts are high on the agenda for these filmmakers). Lily Taylor and Ron Livingston play the parents of five daughters who become bedeviled by some evil forces lurking in the dark recesses of the creaky old fixer-upper they’ve purchased in rural Rhode Island. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are the world-famous paranormal researchers, the Warrens, who attempt to exorcise the demons from the place.<br /><br />The kind of movie for which a spoiler alert is practically superfluous, “The Conjuring” is allegedly based on a true story, a come-on that might have been more convincing had the movie not seemed so much like every other haunted house movie we’ve ever seen. I’d like to believe that even ghosts can’t be this boringly predictable.<br /><br />Maybe someday someone somewhere will come up with something new that will breathe some much-needed life into the genre. Till then, I guess, movies like “The Conjuring” - and there will be many more to come, I’m sure - will just have to do.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|&#34;The Host,&#34; the original story, was written by Twilight writer Stephenie Meyer, but clearly, this is science fiction and is meant to be far more complicated, and thus, of course it has a better and stronger story.<br /><br />The fact that celestial beings have taken hold of human bodies on an extreme level, where everyone just leaves in peace, is not the main focus of the film, and that is a good thing. If we want to watch &#34;Invasion Of The Body Snatchers&#34; or &#34;Stepford Wives,&#34; we will.<br /><br />No, instead, this movie is about the idea that these celestial beings are not without feeling entirely, and that the main character's personality and thoughts still remains inside the &#34;Wanderer&#34; aka &#34;Wanda,&#34; so much she likes the same guy, and she begins to see what it means to be human.<br /><br />Even this story's main antagonist, The Seeker, played by Diane Kruger, clearly has anger issues, given that Wanda is obviously not that important to get a good deal of others killed. She is clearly just pissed off throughout the film, acting like she is complete control but opens fire on her own men just to get to Wanda.<br /><br />The inner talking of the personality by Saisore Ronan, who is Melanie Stryder, the original person whom &#34;Wanda&#34; is inhabiting, is excellent and well-done, sometimes hysterical and sometimes with deep meaning. It makes this film feel very different from pretty much any other.<br /><br />If you like sci-fi at all, you should give this one a watch. People who liked the book have been overly critical that not every time happened the same, and others have dismissed it as being something &#34;else horrible&#34; from writer Stephenie Meyer. The later is beyond unfair bias.<br /><br />Give this film a chance, you won't regret it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book keeps you in suspense.  The reader gets the whole story at the conclusion.  You'll enjoy this story.  Enjoy this book!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|At this price, there's every reason to buy it to get your Netflix, Hulu onto the big screen. Big wish would be for Amazon Instant Video to be available this way too. Worked well for me drawing power from the TV's USB socket
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|Didn't see this in the threatre, but thought I would give it a chance, and was very impressed, they did a great job rebooting the Superman story and I can't wait to see where they go in the future.
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|Slow - boring -I am trying to finish this book, but I am only half way through.  I am not sure I can stay awake to finish it.  I really wanted this book to be another page turner, but it is very disappointing.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Gotta have the 3D, the original version is good, but can't compare to the 3D, the 3D just adds so much depth and gives you a better picture of how big these monsters and robots really are.  If you have 3d capability should get this version.
B008OIQYTG|5.0|Lee has been a favorite of mine for decades.  This offering harkens back to the days when Lee was in the funk/fusion mode and it does not disappoint.  Numerous guest artists add their talents to this set and the level of musicianship is outstanding.
B00E8G5HDW|5.0|Great season, my only complaint is that there were only 20 episodes, would have loved more!!!  This season brings about a bunch of questions that make you think and it ties everything together pretty well.  A must have!!!
0517543052|4.0|this book is true classic!<br />If you don't have it on your book shelf, get it!<br /><br />Its a great source of insight and renewal and captures some of the wisdom of its time and timeless.<br /><br />When feeling like you need a little spiritual lift or reminder, just open it to any page.<br /><br />Also, for a great flashback and context to the era and culture out of which this book evolves, I highly recommend you check out Ann Becoy's &#34;Memoirs of Hippie Girl in India&#34; .. a candid and adventurous true story, that puts you face-to-face in the 70's with Ram Das (the author of Be Here Now) and his contemporaries, through the eyes of a drop dead gorgeous 18 year old hippie girl.

B000SEIDR0|3.0|This review and more available at [...]<br /><br />I recently read this as a non-fiction selection for a book club that I organize. Being the first thing I’ve read by Michael Pollan, I wasn’t sure what to expect.<br /><br />It’s divided up into 3 sections, Industrial Corn, Pastoral Grass, and Personal The Forest.<br /><br />Each of this book’s three parts follows one of the principal human food chains from beginning to end: from a plant, or group of plants, photosynthesizing calories in the sun, all the way to a meal at the dinner end of that food chain.<br /><br />The first section, Industrial Corn, was probably the most interesting. There are a lot of facts about the American corn industry (and agriculture in general) that was quite enlightening. For example, did you know that science can detect the isotopes of carbon in human tissue and calculate how much corn a person has in their diet? Or that corn in American costs more to grow than it does to buy, and the difference is hidden by government subsidies to farmers?<br /><br />Pastoral Grass, section 2, takes a look at Polyface Farm in Virginia. Unlike most of American farming that’s focused on monoculture or packing as many animals as possible into a CAFO (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation), the folks at Polyface rotate crops, and animals, in the same face. They produce beef, chicken, eggs, and other things, all using the same land. They also do not sell their products for shipment, and everything stays mostly local (within a day’s drive). I found this chapter pretty interesting too, but the chicken slaughtering part was tough to read. I think it’s good to see an example of farming the way farming was meant to be, in stark contract to the American factory farming that seems to be almost ubiquitous at this point.<br /><br />The final, Personal, section is my least favorite. Here, Pollan decides he must be vegetarian in order to be objective about evaluating the morals of eating meat. However, from this point on, the book takes on a less journalistic tone, and becomes mostly Pollan’s rationalization back to eating meat.<br /><br />…there remains the question of whether we owe animals that can feel pain any moral consideration, and this seems impossible to deny. And if we owe them moral consideration, how do we justify killing and eating them?<br /><br />Based just on the first two sections, I think this is an amazing book, and is very insightful. It’s too bad that Pollan had to make it more about himself at the end.

B00BD99JMW|3.0|This is the third, and final, novel in the Divergent Trilogy. All in all, I really enjoyed the trilogy and am looking forward to the movie early next year.<br /><br />This was probably my least favorite book of the three. The main reason for this is due to the change in POV. The first two books are all told by Tris. In Allegiant, Roth chose to alternate between Tris and Four/Tobias. It could have worked, however, it was poorly executed. From the beginning, I had to pay close attention to the name at the start of each chapter (which is where the point of view shifts). Again and again, I found myself confused. The narrative voice was always the same and it was virtually impossible to tell if it was a Tris chapter or a Four chapter. I would find myself searching for little clues or jumping back the chapter start to check. As you might imagine, this was very annoying.<br /><br />Along with the new part-time narration by Four, we get a peak inside his head. Well, intentional or not, Four comes off whiny, weak, and a bit of a mess. How we see him through his own voice is quite a bit different from how we’ve seen him in the past through Tris.<br /><br />There are also some revelations in this one that made me less than happy. The plot moves some of our main characters out of the city and into the outside world. This was all fins, but then it gets into some science-y stuff that just didn’t make sense, and goes off on a tangent. There is little in Allegiant about the factions or the city, and that was disappointed.<br /><br />Now, having said all that, I did like it!  I will definitely be keeping my eye out for more novels by Veronica Roth.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|It is a lot of fun but you have to wait a certain amount of Time if you play often or buy credits. If you are patient or play a few minutes at a time it is a lot of fun
B007SGLZP8|5.0|If you like John Grisham you will love this one.  He is a masterful story teller who leaves you reading til 2am each night!!  One suggestion:  If you scratch your head thinking you have missed something along the way, keep reading.  Everything is resolved at the end of the book at which time all loose ends are tied up. Highly recommend this book.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This book took me a few months to read- I would get to a depressing part (every few pages) and have to put it away for a few days.  Force yourself through it, though, as it is worth it!  The Book Thief gives you a perspective on World War II that you may not have considered before.
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|Great true video on the accounts of our Lord... More people should watch this video.  The detail impacts very well.
B002AT4K9G|5.0|Great moving if you are a fast and furious fan this series is a good one, can't wait for the next one to come out.
B007OLYQ4E|1.0|This was one of the worst books I have ever read.  I have never seen the famous movie, but have heard about it.  I can't imagine why it's famous if it even half resembles this book.  A very disjointed story about an abused girl who walks around half naked in front of people she barely knows.  She thinks she's hot stuff and that every one should bow down, and do her bidding.  It's just plain stupid, that's why I didn't like it.  And in my Kindle version, I had several other books by Truman Capote.  I started reading the second short story thinking it was a continuation of Breakfast at Tiffany's.  There was one story in which he wrote about a Christmas long ago, and that story was great!
B002ZOF61M|1.0|Do not buy.  I purchased for my granddaughter for Christmas.  This came in Chinese/Japanese version.  I prefer English since I live in the USA.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Not ready for prime time.  The chromecast will not work if you have a hidden ssid.  On the phone with support, yes google actually has a support number, for about an hour.  Chromecast would not work until I unhid the ssid, which I will not do permanately.  Also I connected it to a 55&#34; LG tv and could get no audio to play on it, connected to a generic brand 20&#34; tv and I got sound.  If your network broadcasts your network name it will probably work.
B00GUJP9PG|1.0|not leting me download it it looks fun but it says. something wrong but there is nothing wrong I clicked redoenload and said the samething
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer was exciting from start to finish.  I never really knew who was the informant,  but that added to the mystery.  Miscarriage of the justice system was very clear,  and the main character deserved what he got.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It could use a upgrade on<br />1. It should let you change from survival to creative.<br />2. MAKE IT LIKE PC MINECRAFT .<br /><br />Other then that it's fine.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I can build with blocks, and I can even spawn animals! This is my favorite application. I did send an issue about the updates, but I still like it.<br /><br />(I feel it is important to tell you that my nine year old, autistic son wrote the above review.  I encourage him to to express his opinion and feel that this is a creative outlet for him to do so.  I in no way helped him write the reviews, however, after he posts them, they show up in my email and I can go in and add this post script.  I will not change grammer, spelling, or remove a review unless it is in some offensive.  To date, this has not been an issue, so I say keep right on reviewing your apps son.)
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|I liked it. It felt real to me. They didn't sugarcoat or glamorize addiction. Denzel always does a good job and this was no different. The rest of the cast left some to be desired. I felt like the story of this girlfriend actually could have been fleshed out. Her departure was a little odd.
B008469DGY|4.0|Would be 5 star if you could play a course instead of repeatedly shooting a 3 par hole<br />Still enjoyable way to pass the time.
