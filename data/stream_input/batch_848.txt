B000YPUF9W|2.0|This movie is bad - so bad, in fact, that I would rather it hadn't been made.     In lue of this travesty of film-making, watch Resident Evil: Apocalypse on TV... Every time Mike Epps' \\"L.J.\\" is supposed to say M*** F***, they dub him saying \\"Motivator.\\" It makes the movie_at least_57 times better. (Which is 946 times better than 'Resident Evil: Extinction.') ^_^

B0013FSL3E|1.0|Wall-E is not a movie that I enjoy watching. The images are too cluttered, and the words are sometimes hard to understand (even with my TV Ears). It seemed like I had to get half way through the movie before I began to comprehend the story.
B00144J6RO|5.0|I, like so many others, knew very little about Barack Obama.  This book is really an \\"eye opener.\\"  In it, Barack Obama tells, in his own words, his history from his youth in Hawaii and Indonesia, then back to Hawaii to Harvard Law School, meeting Michelle in Chicago and finally his run for the Senate from Illinois.  To really understand the man who is the 44th President of the United States, one should read this book.  He tells all about his background and in his telling, we get a really good sense of who he actually is.  Reading this will finally dispell the myths and unknowns about this man.

B000QEIORG|5.0|[[ASIN:B000005K1C Everlong]]At the age of ten, i was given an album called \\"Woodstock\\". Since then i have attended many concerts. I saw tbe Foo Fighters a couple of years ago, and i must say, they are one of the hardest working bands in the music industry. I have attended concerts where the bands just wanted to get it overwith and go on. Not the Foo Fighters. They not only rocked the crowd, they also came out to the arena shaking the fans hands. Foo Fighters, \\"ROCK ON!\\"
B00005M91K|2.0|I see that this film has a lot of positive feedback but I am going to have to go out on a limb here and speak my mind, however unpopular it may become.<br /><br />Although any scene from this movie could be an award winning cover on any magazine ever (yes ever), the fact that there was no narration, no dialogue and obviously no flow, could not be ignored.  The only thought that this movie provoked in me over and over again was \\"what specific type of hallucinogen was it that was the key component to making this film?\\"<br /><br />With that being said, I had seen things in this movie that were truly amazing, however without any intellectual support I have no reference in studying any of the wonderful things further that I had witnessed during this film.  For this reason I was very disappointed.  This forced me to rate this movie with only 2 stars, which was a bit painful since there was some amazing footage shown.  If they re-made this with some sort of effort to dialogue or voice-over it would be pretty amazing.  Until then I am sad to say that the pretty pictures are just not enough.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|This has to be one of the worst movies ever. Believe me don't waste your time. If you can get past the first 45 minutes you win...I couldn't.
0743270754|5.0|I highly recommend this book; I believe what is so great about it is that despite its history Ms. Doris will successfully make you anxiously wait for what is going to happen. I liked the way she outlined most critical events from different points of view.<br /><br />What's more, she leaves you fairly, the judgment of Lincoln political genius as well as his setbacks. I think this book would suppress any other Lincoln biography since anyone judgment must be influenced by one's intellectuals, and the surrounding environment, especially those whom interacts in the decision making process.
B00005JPTK|4.0|Will Smith is once more playing a role that can really suite him. While not a comedy, he does pull off the serious role required in I Am Legend.    While this movie does lose something the second time watched, the movie is still rewatchable and a good addition to any movie collection, whether you love Will Smith, Suspense, or just a movie buff.

B0001XAOLQ|5.0|Las casi 5 horas de duración de esta película demuestran fielmente lo que tuvieron que vivir los tripulantes de un submarino alemán durante la 2da Guerra Mundial. La versión \\"Director's Cut\\" no muestra una serie de detalles y hace perder el hilo de la historia.

B001F7MSFW|5.0|In the hands of a less visionary director than Guillermo del Toro, Hellboy 2 could have been a lame spin-off but this time a lot more dark fantasy has been added. Ron Perlman returns as Hellboy, the Dark Horse Comics demon-hero and Mike Mignola's great creation with roots in the mythical world but personal ties in the human realm. I believe that this one is better than the first one and I love the first Hellboy. Red and his colleagues take on a royal elf (Luke Goss) determined to smash a longtime truce between mankind and the forces of magic. Meanwhile, Red's relationship with girlfriend Liz (Selma Blair), who can burst into flames at will, is going through a rocky stage observed by Red's fishy friend Abe (Doug Jones), himself struck by love in this film. Del Toro brilliantly integrates the ordinary and extraordinary, diving into an extended scene set in a troll market barely hidden behind the façade of typical city streets.<br /><br />Guillermo del Toro has done a wonderful job on this sequel with better character development this time around, more humour and of course more action. Del Toro's art direction proves masterful, too, in a climactic battle with the golden army as well as Nuada's confrontation with Hellboy.<br /><br />Hellboy 2 is grand sequel accompanied with great visual and a fantastic imagination from the brillant Guillermo del Toro.
0765348276|4.0|Perhaps my title requires some explanation.  I am 66 years old (the older part of the title) and brand new to reading science fiction (the newbie portion of the title).  As of today this book already has 286 reviews here on Amazon.  I had decided not to write a review, until a friend - the same one who recommended that I read this book - pointed out that I do have something to add, a personal perspective concerning this book.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book so much that I would really, really appreciate it if Amazon would allow me to color in half of that remaining star.  This was a sure fire 4.5 star book for me.  And that's saying something coming from a reader who is as persnickety as I am.  I enjoyed the writing, I enjoyed the plot and I enjoyed the overall concept of the novel.  I can fully imagine this story taking place in the future.<br /><br />The gist of the story is that John Perry has reached his 75th birthday and it is time for him to make good on his decision from ten years back to join the Colonial Defense Forces.  When he does this John will be required to leave Earth and everything he knows and loves behind forever.  John's wife Kathy died eight years earlier and now John has completed all the arrangements necessary to leave the world he knows and to go exploring.  The carrot at the end of the stick of his two years of military service is that he will keep his \\"new\\" body and be given land on a colony protected by the CDF.  The method of reaching his goal?  Fighting aliens whenever and however he is told to.  His training is outstanding because it will need to be.  The Colonial Defense Force leaders don't exactly tell their new recruits the whole truth regarding their service, much less their average life expectancy.<br /><br />I loved this story in part because it made me think about all of the \\"what if's\\" of a future world.  Taking into account the fact that my own personal age is not that far away from being eligible to join up, this actually hit quite close to home.  It was one of those books which makes you think about it even when you aren't reading.  IF this were not science fiction, could I make the same decision John Perry made?  IF this chance to be young again was presented to me, would I take it?<br /><br />Admittedly I don't have any other writers or plots or alien worlds or futuristic concepts to compare this book to.  I just know that I thoroughly enjoyed it and I will be getting \\"The Ghost Brigades\\" (book #2), and \\"The Last Colony\\" (book #3) in this series.  I already have one other book by John Scalzi.  You can bet I will be starting it very soon.uite close to home.  It was one of those books which makes you think about it even when you aren't reading.

B001DTPZNY|3.0|I thought this was okay...not the revised updated character like Sly Stallone did with Rocky Balboa and John Rambo. I think the problem here is George Lucas. This guy has not been relevant since the Empire Strikes Back!! Keep George out of the next one...and get some new \\"eyes\\" for the next time. Yes, there needs to be another try. I don't want the bad taste of this latest one to linger in my memory!!
141690977X|1.0|I bought this book erroneously believing it to be a chick lit novel, due to the movie coming out. Err, no. I read it anyway, since I just spent twelve dollars on it, and I wish I hadn't. This book touts itself as being about female empowerment, but it's actually about male disempowerment. I also think the whole set-up was misleading-the writer keeps saying \\"100% of men randomly polled\\" which I know as having a degree in English and sociology is a flawed survey because it doesn't say how the survey was conducted, who was surveyed, what ages, etc etc. This is presented as evidence that the writer knows his stuff, yet is not a scientific study. I suspect the men polled were his drinking buddies and the survey occurred with a lot of hooraying over beer and chicken wings during football game commercials. Yes, men are always completely honest in that setting.       My whole issue is, I don't want a guy to be \\"THAT\\" into me. The idea of some guy being THAT into me that he tracks me down after chatting with me in a bar, asks me out in the first conversation, eschews his dying mother to have a date with me, can't keep his hands off of me...forgets about friends, ex lovers, family, and his job...all because he loves me...based on ONE encounter in bar...to be a little creepy. Okay, a lot creepy! I don't want some obsessive stalker!       As a woman, I believe men process things differently, communicate different...but underneath it all, they have the same feelings. There are men out there who are afraid of rejection, who don't want a committment because their parents had a horrible break-up, who are carrying baggage from previous relationships, who are under tremendous pressure at work, who have family troubles...in short, men are just like women in different packaging. So what if a man calls me after a month telling me he's been busy? So what if it turns out he was exploring another option, or trying to work things out with his ex wife, or if he just started another job andneeded to focus on that...he's calling me NOW. Which means he kept thinking of me, and kept me in mind. What's wrong with that? Love takes time and effort, and it doesn't happen all at once. If we women except men to go from 0 to 100 on the strength of one brief encounter, we're going to be disappointed. And, we're going to end up with someone mentally unstable.        Some of what the writer said is true, we women tend to hold on to our bad apples too long hoping they'll \\"see the light\\". Yet isn't that part of life? You have to kiss a lot of frogs to find the prince...and if you skip over the frog kissing part, how will you ever know when you found the prince? Or appreciate him?
B000GX57YK|1.0|This DVD was purchased as a Christmas present. I just found out that it is defective. Now it's too late to exchange it.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This album along with Images and Words was my introduction to Dream Theater last year.  I bought them at the same time and listened to Images and Words first since it was older.  I liked that album and was glad to have discovered a new rock group that I could enjoy.  I then listened to this album and was very impressed.  Dream Theater had clearly evolved during the ten years that separated the two albums.  I've bought other Dream Theater albums since then including Metropolis Part 2, Octavarium, and Systematic Chaos and like them all very much.  What I especially like is that they combine great hard rock with excellent storytelling and intelligent lyrics.  Dream Theater is a very versatile band and produces music with a wide range. Some of their albums like Octavarium and Systematic Chaos have a very hard-edged sound to them, verging on heavy metal; but others like Metropolis Part 2 are less abrasive and more accessible to progressive rock fans who might enjoy the music of Rush, Yes, or Kansas.  This double album lets you experience both sides of the band's musical personality.  The first CD is more heavy metalic while the second CD is closer to Yes or Kansas.  (But only musically; Dream Theater would never write the gibberish lyrics that Yes spouts.)  The first CD has 5 songs while the second CD has the magnum opus 42 minute long title track.    My favorite song on the first side is \\"Misunderstood\\"; this beautiful anthem could have been a big radio hit if radio stations had actually played it at all to give it exposure. At 9:34 minutes, it was probably too long; additionally, DT should have cut out some of the instrumental chaos at the end.  The title track is a musical collection of short stories about various pschological disorders.  It is a great concept and is musically rich.  My favorite section of it is \\"Solitary Shell\\".    If you want to explore the music of Dream Theater, 6DOIT is a great starting place.  But it and enjoy!
0385338732|3.0|My husband gave this to me for Christmas along with a bunch of other books.  The first third of the book was very clever and I enjoyed the plot.  As you've read from other reviewers, Lexi wakes up from a car crash and can't remember the previous three years.  In that time she's moved up the corporate ladder, married a gorgeous billionaire, and thinks her life is going to be perfect.  It does some plot changes that made me think I was reading a female version of the movie Regarding Henry.  However, I really enjoyed the end of the book.  Due to the plot being slightly unoriginal as well as the writing technique, I don't rate it very high.  But, if you want a light fun read this is a good one.  I don't think I would personally have picked it out of a book store for myself but at least it was entertaining.
B000021XS0|5.0|I only discovered Dream Theater last year and did not get this album until after buying more recent albums like Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, Octavarium, and Systematic Chaos.  For the past 30 years, Rush has been my favorite rock group, followed by groups like Rainbow, Deep Purple, Cream and Black Sabbath; but Dream Theater has won a place at the top of my list both for their exciting music and great storytelling.  While I like almost all of Rush's albums, I actually wish they would go back to telling stories in long songs like they did in 2112 and Hemispheres. I'm pointing all this out because I think anyone who liked those old Rush albums will probably like Dream Theater and this album very much.    Metropolis Part 2 is a progressive metal rock opera that is structured as a single cohesive piece of music in 2 acts that are further divided into smaller scenes.  It is like opera not just because it tells a story but also because the instrumental sections reinforce that story with musical themes that reoccur throughout the entire piece.  Musically, it is similar to the title track of Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence; anyone who liked that should like this album too.  But while SDoIT was like a collection of thematically linked short stories, this album is more like a novel, telling a single story that spans 77 minutes.  Fans who only know the harder-edged Dream Theater sound of Octavarium and Systematic Chaos might miss the raw intensity of those albums, but I think you'll end up liking this album as long as you give it a fair listen and some time to grow on you.    The story itself is very interesting, there are lots of good melodies, and the singling and instrumentals are all outstanding.  While some might find the story confusing, you can find clarification about what it all means on Wikipedia.  I highly recommend this album both to current Dream Theater fans and to people who like Rush or any of the other groups I mentioned above.
B0006J28BO|4.0|I have yet to watch the English version of this film so my review is based on the original Japanese release.  It's a light and fun story of a high school girl who saves the life of a cat who ends up being the prince of Cat Kingdom.  The kingdom therefore wants to shower Haru with gifts, one of the gifts is becoming the princess of the Kingdom.  This is one our family's favorite Hayao Miyazaki films (behind Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service).  Our three year is always asking to watch it.<br />We did watch a few minutes of the English version just so our daughter could understand more (she's just learning Japanese) and the voices were better than most of the Disney dubbed films.  However, one voice ruined it for us (the king's servant) and we switched back to Japanese.  I'd recommend the Cats Return to parents of young kids or anyone that enjoys Hayao Miyazaki's films or Japanimation in general.

B000HA4WT8|4.0|I admit that I have put this movie off for quite some time.  I liked the first movie and felt that the absence of all original stars would make this lame.  I was only partially correct.<br /><br />The predictable obvious:<br /><br />-There will be a substitute for Paul Walker.<br />Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) is an average substitute.  While a competent actor, he doesn't quite have the big man on campus/sliver spoon/prom king vibe that Paul Walker oozed.<br /><br />-There will be a substitute for Vin Diesel.<br />D.K. \\"Drift King\\" (Brian Tee) is not even half of what Diesel was, despite the fact that he's supposed to be linked to Yakuza.  To be quite honest, he's neither as tough as either of Vin Diesel's bearded sycophants for the original, nor the original Asian bad guy.<br /><br />-There will be copious hot women.<br />This was improvement over the original.  It would be pointless to prove this FACT; just go to the IMDB page and click the link for each actress.  Then google the ones that don't have pictures.  Trust me on this.  For starters, however: Nathalie Kelley, Nikki Griffin, Ashika Gogna, Caroline de Souza Correa, Verena Mei.<br /><br />-There will be a ton of racing and fancy cars.<br />The racing in this movie is undoubtedly better than the original.  In fact, there appears to be more racing than storyline, which is probably for the best.  As for that...<br /><br />American kid gets in trouble for racing - he's been in trouble before.  He's forced to go to Japan to live with his Navy father.  In a matter of not time he finds the racing scene in Japan, where \\"drifting\\" is all the rage - it's nothing new, they did it on the Dukes of Hazzard all the time.  Boy wrecks car, owes someone car, gets involved in shady criminal underworld, becomes inexplicably trusted and befriended by nearly all popular people in school.  Boy gets girl, learns to race, wins final race, overcomes difficulties, saves the day.  Aside from that, there a few highly ridiculous parts of the script - particularly a gaijin taking on the Yakuza in any format and Bow Wow's groan inducing performance/subplot - that take quite a bit away from the movie.<br /><br />It's exactly what one would expect.

My wife and I both found the movie to be involving and enjoyable.    If you have a Blu-ray player then this is a must-have movie.  The color pallette is incredible and you're going to want to see every last detail of the exotic locations.  The soundtrack and the extras are also very good.  This movie is different than your typical Hollywood fare and that also makes it easy to recommend it.

1400079179|1.0|For an author who takes himself so dreadfully seriously, Brown unintentionally succeeds in writing one of the year's best comedies. Brown regurgitates various discounted historical theories in an incredibly amateur way, throwing misused words and tired cliches into a formulaic Scooby-Doo plotline. Each chapter ends with a cliffhanger in which Brown strategically witholds information from the reader - information that the characters already know - in order to manufacture a feeling of suspense.<br /><br />In addition, the prose is excessively flowery:<br /><br />\\"As Langdon stood up, Fache walked over to the spotlight and turned it off. The gallery plunged into sudden darkness. Momentarily blinded, Langdon felt a rising uncertainty. Fache's silhouette appeared, illuminated in bright purple. He approached carrying a portable light source which shrouded him in a violet haze.\\"<br /><br />I literally laughed out loud at that last sentence. And, of course, a silhouette is not a silhouette if it is illuminated, but I digress.
B001GCUNVW|4.0|In many sports, champions rarely seem to know when to quit.  So, rather than quit while on top they all too often go for one more bout.  One more shot at fame.  In so many cases, the result is ignominious failure.  It is this process that is at the heart of \\"The Wrestler\\".<br /><br />Mickey Rourke plays Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson, a one time wrestling great who, twenty years after his glory days, is still trying to eek out an existence in the game.  He is no longer performing in Madison Square Garden.  Instead, he performs before tiny crowds in cold suburban halls.  He knows no other trade.  He is a dinosaur.<br /><br />The balance of the Ram's life is also a mess.  His daughter has disowned him and his romantic life is pathetic.  Randy has hit rock bottom when he collapses from a heart attack.  He survives thanks to a double bi-pass and it is how he confronts his own decline that is the crux of the film.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke is tremendous as the wrestler.  He is a hulk of a man and dominates the film throughout.  This is, indeed, Rourke's own comeback and, unlike the story of the Ram, Rourke succeeds.  He could well be nominated for an Academy Award.  If so, it would be well deserved.  His whole persona is absorbed in the role of the declining star.  Rourke is simply marvellous.<br /><br />There are many who may refrain from seeing the film on the basis that it is violent and simply a sports film.  This would be a naïve approach.  The film is not so much about sport as about the character study of a flawed but well meaning man.

B000B7QCKE|5.0|I purchased this DVD subsequent to \\"Yanni Tribute,\\" which was extraordinary and delightful. \\"Live at the Acropolis\\" is very good listening, but quite different; and therefore, difficult to compare.  On its own, I would say it is very good music. It depend on one's taste, and/or mood. One thing I very much appreciate about these two albumns is that there is nothing on them that I feel a need to skip. Live at the Acropolis is a bit more subdued;the music is excellent. I especially enjoy the violins, subtle humor, and good will.     This is really a good DVD/CD to have. I am more than pleased.
B000002LHX|3.0|With three numbers already recorded in some form, but not released - Electric Chair (June 1988), Scandalous (October 1988), Vicki Waiting (December 1988) - before Prince undertook this project, which means he had extraordinary ESP or was using his incredible international stardom to clean out the vault and tweak material for projects outside his solo albums.<br /><br />The nine tracks clock in at 42:29 and the album soared to #1 on the Billboard 200 and R&B album charts, but the results are uneven at best. Batdance, Partyman (w/ \\"Anna Fantastic\\") and Electric Chair are sizzlers, though the drop-off in quality after the trio is amazing.<br /><br />Certainly not the place to start when exploring Prince's intriguing album catalog, but the strong three tracks - with Trust - at least show where his pop sensibilities were playing before his New Power Generation concept that was a few years down the road.
B000Z27HLS|3.0|Northanger Abbey is Austen's most poorly written of her famous group of period depictions primarily due its focus: a defense of the novel form.   Unlike her other works, which provide rich characterization, witty dialogues and keen observations, the storyline in Northanger depends primarily on misunderstandings. Having said all that, and having been bored senseless by the plodding nature of the book, the producers of this movie actually make the story rather interesting through filming technique, and excellent depiction of the time period.  Now ... if one could only rewrite the script!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Cartoons aren't just for kids anymore. This computer animated film is intelligent and beautiful enough where anyone, no matter what age, can feast their eyes (is that the phrase?) on this DIsney sure-to-be classic. What else is to expect from Pixar? I believe that this movie is their most important one--there is very little dialogue in the first half of the movie and it tells its story through the visuals. But don't let that bore you. WALL-E is expressive and adorable and we care about him from the first frame we see him in. As more characters are introduced we care about them too, and they are animated and voiced (if at all) wonderfully. There is a good, if overused message at play here, but you should see what that is for yourself. The music is great, the live-action incorporated bits are fun, and the story is involved and deep. Just watch it, you don't need to read reviews like this to see this awesome film. Buying the DVD would be worth it :)

031606792X|3.0|I think it's important, before I begin, to say that I am not one of the many teen girls who fell in love with Edward.  I am a 36 year old wife and mom.. who fell in love with Edward :)<br /><br />One week ago I began reading the Twilight series.  Book one completely captured my attention and wouldn't let go.  Book two was fabulous at the beginning and end (the middle not so much, as Jacob is not an appealing character in my opinion).  Book three was good, but Bella began to frustrate me with her flip flopping, her callous treatment of the men in her life, and the ridiculous treatment she allowed (and eventually encouraged) to happen repeatedly with Jacob.  If this book was directed at teen girls, I find it very irresponsible to encourage such a blase attitude toward abuse.<br /><br />But alas, this is a review for book 4.  In the middle of reading book three, I began to wonder.. am I going to like the fourth book?  I came to Amazon to read reviews, and from what you can see here, a majority are not in favor of the book.  Intrigued by what people were writing, I headed over to wiki for a plot summary.<br /><br />Needless to say, I read book 4 with no small amount of dread, knowing the major plot details and not liking what was in store.<br /><br />I won't give spoilers (although there are certainly plenty in other reviews here).<br /><br />I just finished today, and I must say that it was not as painful as I was led to expect, but it was a far cry from book 1. I can see where Ms. Meyers was trying to go with this, and what she was trying to accomplish, but I found myself rewriting the book in my head almost constantly.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the first part of the book, from Bella's perspective.  It was still that exciting, tender, forbidden love between mortal and immortal, with Edward and Bella as the focus.<br /><br />The second part, from Jacob's perspective, I skimmed over. I intend to go back and read part two later, but I felt that the change in point-of-view would be distracting, would break the continuity and flow of the series.<br /><br />The third part, from Bella's perspective again, was almost as good as before.. at first.

1439102813|5.0|I could not put this book down!  Alice became very personal to me as I continued reading. I cuddled up with a pot of tea and read this in one day. I watched my father go down hill quickly, however, he had a form of dementia, however, some of the things that he did duplicated Alice's behavior, such as getting lost, forgetting to eat, not being able to follow conversations, and writing notes to himself so that he could remember.  \\"Still Alice\\" was written with heart and a true reflection of how a family should pull together to deal with their elderly parents. My father's illness tore our family apart. I would recommend that family's who may be dealing with Alzheimers or even a lessor form of dementia take the time to read this book...it will touch your Heart.
B001GZ6QC4|1.0|I loved the movie - don't get me wrong. Warner Brothers are hacks though!!! I bought the DVD and then I have to pay $1.99 to get the digital copy?!?!?!?!? Take a lesson from Disney you momney-grubbing idiots; Prince Caspian was free!!!!!! Oh and in the TINY TINY wording below - \\"not compatible with Ipods\\". WHAT?!?!?! The most popular piece of technology in years and it's not compatible??? I literally never write negative reviews; if I don't like something I don't feel the need to stomp on someone's artistic efforts, but this is downright deplorable!!!!

B0000942HV|5.0|Was'nt sure i would enjoy the shift in technique of the 2003 remix but after listening have decided to put her right next to the original in my audio collection with pride. Mike Oldfield continues to amaze me with his abilities to not only be able to play so many instruments but to assemble them in an orgasmic auditory sensation. 5 Stars, and a smoke for this one.
B000UAFDP2|5.0|This movie is a hoot!!! It is also probably THE greatest reason to buy into the blu ray system. I needed a shower after watching this movie because I actually felt like I had been knee deep in giant bug guts for 2+ hours when it was over. GREAT EXPERIENCE that could only be experienced with Blu Ray!!<br />There are a lot of other movies that you will just plain miss out on way too much without the superior video and audio quality of Blu Ray. If you dont believe me, check out a system with this movie then watch the same movie on standard DVD......night and day difference!!!!
B000BKVQTS|3.0|The Brothers Grimm struggles beneath the weight of a clumsy and leaden script peppered with self-conscious humour. There's the seed of an interesting film here but it never really germinates due to the poorly developed ideas. The first two acts are ponderous but the momentum picks up towards the end and the final act comes closest to realising the film's potential. Some of the manoeuvres used to shoehorn the brothers' fairy tales into the plot are less successful than others (the Ginger Bread Man in particular feels awkward), and at times the CGI is a letdown, while at others it's quite stunning. As with many of Gilliam's films one can envision what he intended here, even though he fails to pull it off. Definitely a curate's egg.

0061537934|5.0|This is one of those \\"forever\\" books: I'll keep it forever, return to it forever, recommend it forever.  I'm a writer - at least I thought I was until I read \\"The Art of Racing....\\"  Garth Stein has shown me what real writing is all about - how to tell a beautiful story from a compelling viewpoint and touch a reader at that innermost level.  I have two golden retrievers, but I tend to avoid sentimental dog books.  This book is the best, and will be appreciated and cherished by people who don't have dogs, and maybe even by cat owners (though I doubt it).  \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" exemplifies the art of writing at it's highest level.

B00005J6SZ|4.0|Like a Virgin being Madonna's 1984 and her 2nd studio album was her major breakthrough with such major hits as Like a Virgin and Material Girl. Other tracks that stand out on this realeas are Love does not live here anymore and Into the groove.  The booklet is really nice with two fine photographs of Madonna looking very stylish in different outfits.  The lyrics are very easy to read and it has a nice list of whom played and what they played on each track. 4/5.

1400063515|5.0|Unforeseen events keep having enormous impacts on all our lives. Yet human nature is such that we do not learn that this is true. We continue to project the present into the future, are jarred by an unforseen event, rationalize that we should have seen that coming, then resume projecting the present into the future.<br /><br />The author asserts that<br />1. we don't learn that projections of the future are unreliable, and<br />2. we don't learn that we don't learn item 1.<br /><br />Considering these ideas during the month since reading the book I have seen many projections of the future that I'm now sure are, in fact, worthless. Predictions about the economy, climate, health, war. All the big things, all unknown to all, all events that we find comfort in defering to expert prognosticators on. All events that the expert prognosticators have been wrong about in the past. Yet we keep listening to their predictions and acting as though their predictions have any meaning.<br /><br />The book is full of examples I remember living through. And I wondered why I didn't seem to learn from my experiences. But that's the point of the book.<br /><br />So read the book, laugh along the way, and use the author's insights to help take a step back to gain another perspective on how fragile our assumptions about life are.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I bought an  extra controller so we could play multiplayer games on our PS3.  I am amazed at how well these work.  They are easy to charge, hold a charge for a long time, and never have connection problems.  This is much different that the experience I had with 3rd party wireless controllers for our PS2.  I think Sony has this figured out.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Dr. Horrible's sing-a-long blog is hilarious! Any fan of Neil Patrick Harris or Joss Whedon needs to get their hands on this immediately. The DVD is both extremely reasonably priced and totally worth paying for, there are several special features (including \\"Commentary, the musical!\\" and many featurettes). Fantastic cast, crew, writers, and such fun to watch!
B00003CXBK|5.0|I bought this video for my son who has watched it at least twice since we received it.  The story is very good and it is fun to listen to big name stars (Billy Bob Thornton) doing the voice for Japanese characters.  The DVD arrived on time and in excellent condition just as the seller promised.

B00005JLEU|5.0|After viewing _Princess Mononoke_ and reading the rave reviews by Amazon customers, I purchased _Spirited Away_.  The incredible artistic detail, the magnificent characterization, and the riveting, detailed and complex storyline that I expected from a Miyazaki film were all there.<br /><br />In _Sprited Away_, young Chihiro and her family accidently arrive at an onsen (bathouse) for spirits.  The parallels to _Alice in Wonderland_ are many, as Chihiro seeks to rescue her parents and find her way back to her own world.  Along the way she learns self-reliance, the value of hard work, and the importance of family.  It is a rich and marvelous film.  As I am coming to expect, there are also shinto undertones to the story, as rivers spirits, radish spirits and other assorted fantastic creatures play a role in the story and its message.<br /><br />Of the three Miyazaki films I have seen, this is my favorite by far - the characters are memorable, the animation is visually stunning, and the story is entertaining.  For those who, like me, are new to the genre and  to Miyazaki, this is the film to begin with.  Highly recommended.
0316017922|5.0|This is a very entertaining and informative book which attempts to explain why some people become successful and others do not. Gladwell investigates such things as IQ, time of birth, country of origin and, perhaps most important, family background. What I found puzzling is the criteria by which Gladwell measures success. For example, a group of kids with very high IQ's were studied and followed throughout their lives to see what would become of them. Some became supreme court judges, heart surgeons, attorneys, etc. and this was deemed the &#34;successful&#34; group. Those who ended up in mediocre jobs were not, and the book attempts to explain what happened to this latter group of disappointing under-achievers. Gladwell concludes that unforeseen circumstances, family background, and other factors somehow interefered with the expected outcome.  The problem with this line of thinking, is that it equates professional success with personal success. It was never revealed how many of these supposed &#34;success stories&#34; were depresssed, alcoholics, suffering from stress-related heart diseases, or divorced 5 times with kids who refuse to talk to them. Likewise, the &#34;less successful&#34; group may be enjoying good health, long-term happy and committed relationships, and positive interaction with friends and family. What if the &#34;successful&#34; group is less happy and fulfilled in their personal lives than the latter group? Which group is more successful by truly meaningful criteria? Why do we define success by a person's job, social status, and earning potential? This is the only complaint I have with this otherwise fascinating book....
1595141715|4.0|Hannah, a HS student, committed suicide. No one was really sure why. Until the tapes came. . .<br /><br />Hannah made tapes detailing the reasons why, and the people responsible for, her suicide. This is harsh teenage reality--rumors hurting reputations, drinking, rape. This is not a happy book but it is extremely powerful. How does someone feel so alone? How could no one notice her state of mind? This is unfortunately a very real book. Teenagers will totally be hooked into the book--I was.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|I was a psych nurse for many years and this was a great movie.  It arrived quick and in great shape.
0545128285|1.0|Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Boring! Boring! Asinine! Not aimed at her supposed audience! What child ever wanted to read page after page of literary commentary in his book, even if it is written by Dumbledore? Kids deserve a story. And the stories that remain, after you remove the commentary, are dull. Oh, yes, and the commentary is dull too. This is not just a massive charity instrument for Rowling, it is a manipulation and fraud on her extensive readership. This seems to be the plan:    A. Make them read it because they think it enhances the Harry Potter series  B. Give them crap  C. Donate the proceeds to charity.   ...What a waste of her effort, and every reader's time and money. Why didn't she just donate a few million outright? That would have been more honest. The woman's a billionaire, after all.    To be fair, the fairy tale, with its usually brief but broad style, is extremely difficult to write well; it's hard to make the characters memorable in the middle of a fable-ized plot where we immediately look at the text with unicorn-colored glasses. Like Pat Robertson, we expect miracles. Any modern fable begins with a noisy background of all the fables that came before it. A major fable or fairy tale Character cannot be just himself; he must often be a stencil, a New Type. So many good fairy tales and fairy tale characters exist and are still great and wonderful, despite Rowling's disdain for fairy princesses who are saved by princes. The old stories stick in our minds like jewels, and a successful tale writer must compete with that gleam. Good thing Rowling didn't try to. She'd have embarrassed herself. Oh, wait, she managed to do that anyway, with her quasi-fabley language and mundane, plodding plots. And those characters.     Speaking of which, whatever possessed her to place a heart-licking fetishist in a kid's book? Seems like she wanted to include some of the traditional fairy tale horror in one of the tales, but she couldn't think of anything except hair, licking, and blood. I'm all for something inventive in the horror line, but this one doesn't work. That scene -- in which the king removes his own and his bride's hearts and starts salivating -- springs sort of out of nowhere and doesn't really fit the rest of her story. Leaves you wondering, Why on earth is he licking her heart? Additionally, the hair on the king's own heart (assisted by the illustration) simply reminds me of unshaved legs. Hmmm. You know, there is a lot of unfocused, bumbling feminism in this stupid book. I wish she'd try again, like Samuel Richardson, and write a version of these tales actually worth paper.
1401219268|5.0|I was really happy to finally get in my hands Alan Moore and David Gibbon's Watchmen. It is really a fine book, Time Magazine included it among the 100 Best Novels of the 20th Century and indeed it deserves to be in such a list. Regarding the product, I got it sooner than I expected and even though I didn't know wether it was a hardback or a paperback, I was glad to discover that it was a hardback edition. Completely unused, perfect conditions. Thank you!
B00003CXBK|5.0|As a relative neophyte to anime, I had assume the art form was limited to Pokemon and similar low-production value animation with similarly low-budget storylines. I was wrong. Oh, how I was wrong.<br /><br />_Princess Mononoke_ is one of several \\"anime\\" films written and drawn by Hayao Miyazaki, who is a master of the art form. The characters are a long, long way away from the ridiculous \\"cartoons\\" I associated with anime - his are on a whole other level of detail and form. The storyline, as well, was much deeper and complex than I had given the genre credit for. The protagonists are not entirely \\"good\\", and the antagonists are not entirely \\"evil\\" - an honest representation of human nature, I thought - well beyond what I was expecting. The story's complexity furthered by the myriad themes: the costs of human greed, the price of environmental degridation, and the conflict of doing what is right for the individual versus what is for the greater good.<br /><br />What was most surprizing, however, were the shinto overtones to the story in both character and in animation: the interplay of light and dark on characters, the relationship between \\"spirit guardian\\" and mankind, and the casting of a Buddhist monk as an antagonist.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film tremendously, as did my 7 year-old daughter (for whom much of the subtleties were lost on, but who remained riveted by the masterful storytelling.) While _Princess Mononke_ is not my favorite Miyazaki film, it warrants 5 stars nonetheless.
B00007KWHG|4.0|This cd is great, arrived in one piece. However, it was supposed to get here on the 24th in time for christmas and didnt get here until the 26th. I am very disappointed especially since it shipped on the 19th, plenty of time if it had been sent first class but it was not.
B001J1O848|5.0|They don't make good action flicks like they used to. Nowadays everything is CGI matrix style (which I have no problem with) but sometimes, a guy kickin' butts and busting heads is extremely refreshing. Neeson's performance is superb. Flawless. This guy is like a hybrid between Jason Bourne and Jack Bauer. The sound in the movie is also awesome. If you have a good Home Theater system (How someone can own a Blu-Ray player and a have bad Home Theater system is beyond me), put this movie in your Blu-Ray player, get some popcorn and blast away. Let the neighbors complain. Who cares. Liam Neeson stole the show on this one.

B000NA28IE|4.0|I have not read the books associated with this film so I'm in a good position to evaluate the film on its own merit. Clearly people are all over the place with this film (from one star to five stars and everything in between) and I can detect without difficulty that many folks feel strongly about the movie either one way or another.<br /><br />THE STORY: This film manifests your basic \\"good versus evil\\" theme. A malevolent despot king rules the land but he has one fear -- that a \\"dragonrider\\" (and a dragon) will reappear to ultimately dethrone and destroy him. This nasty king has a powerful wizard of sorts, ready at his beck and call to deliver on his evil plans. The wizard rules over a really nasty pack of dreadful pseudo-humans who possess magical powers and skills.<br /><br />But the dragonrider, Eragon, and his female dragon, Saphira, also utilize magic to do battle with the bad guys. Various mentors and allies come along to guide and aid Eragon and, of course, there is a culmination of the two factions in a Battle Royal. The film's conclusion clearly leaves the way open for the sequel film.<br /><br />Let me say up front that this is a fine fantasy film, lots of action, a good story, superb cinematography, and great acting. What I detected was a number of \\"film techniques\\" (for lack of a better phrase) which mirrored the action in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy: [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)]].<br /><br />I realize that they are the same sort of story and that \\"Eragon\\" may, in fact, soon turn into a series of films like LOTRs; however, at every turn I kept finding myself reliving scenes from LOTRs so I was just a tiny bit distracted by this.<br /><br />The huge bulk of complaints that I see on this film (especially at IMDB) is that the books are purportedly so much better than the film. Well, when was this not true in the case of nearly any film which had its genesis in a book? So I therefore discount much of this facet of criticism, even though it may be true. I felt the same way about LOTRs but this diminution of excellence from book to film was a personal expectation -- as a consequence, I was not disappointed when I viewed the film trilogy.<br /><br />So here are my recommendations: if you have read the books and feel strongly that the film will be a weak second, then don't watch it. But if you've never read the books and you want to see a fine film (even if it borrows a bit in technique from LOTRs), then I think that you'll enjoy this one.<br /><br />The Special Edition version contains a second disc -- here's what you'll find on it:<br /><br />-- audio commentary with Director Stefen Fangmeier.<br />-- extended and deleted scenes with optional director's commentary.<br />-- \\"Inside the Inheritance Trilogy\\": \\"The Magic of Eragon\\" documentary.<br />-- \\"Eldest\\" -- the first two chapters of the second book in the \\"Inheritance Trilogy\\".<br />-- \\"The Inhabitants of Alagaësia\\" character featurettes.<br />-- Arya's Ambush original animatic sequence with optional director's commentary.<br />-- Vision of Eragon conceptual art gallery.<br />-- pronunciation guide.<br />-- original and unused storyboard galleries.<br />-- Christopher Paolini interview.<br />-- \\"The Secrets of Alagaësia\\" visual effects featurette.<br />-- Saphira's animation guide CGI featurette with director's commentary.<br />-- original teaser and trailer<br /><br />This 2006 film is in widescreen and runs a total of 103 minutes.of criticism, even though it may be true.

0810979772|4.0|I gave this to my 8 year old grandson who has read another book from this series. He really likes the books & was very enthusiastic about this one too. I got this book for him because he told his mother that he wanted another book from this series.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|I have to say I didn't have high expectations for this show when I first saw it advertised. However it was only the 3rd show I've watched from day one, that I loved. Most shows I don't get into until they are already in daily reruns.  The show was well cast and is well acted. The storylines have been surprisingly good, and have managed to build suspense and action into most of the episodes. Its really a very good somewhat dark drama, mixed with some action and humor. The main plotlines involve trying to stop the judgment day future from happening while trying to prepare for it at the same time.  Currently this is my favorite show on TV and I really hope they keep it going. It appears to me they have a number of good storylines going, and I'd love to see them all play out. If you liked the terminator movies you show should definitely check out this show.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This is an excellent box set.... It has the best sound quality that I have ever heard in a movie, excellent for testing the limits of your new surround sound system. The picture quality is great; it is very gritty though, it is not meant to be a clean looking cinematic like you might find in other war films.     In my opinion, this is the best World War II film ever produced when it comes to overall enjoyment and engagement. Don't come looking for a big picture though, the film very much focuses on the individuals within a relatively small group called \\"Easy Company\\". The bonus features on the Blu-Ray does allow you to track where they are located, some background information about what is happening, and other interesting information.     It is a great buy.... If you like war films and want a great story too (if you want to find just brute action, this isn't it), this is the way to go.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I purchased this set as a gift for my husband's birthday.  He is a die hard Star Trek fan and absolutely loves the set!  He's been watching the episodes with our 2 kids (8&11)and they like it too!

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I LOOOOOVE these headphones. I was looking for a professional quality headphone for a reasonable price. These headphones are the sound studio industry standard, so the price is totally reasonable. These headphones have a dynamic range (GREAT bass and clear treble, you can hear things in songs you had never noticed before, individual backup singers' voices, etc.), they are very comfortable, and you can baaaaaaaaarely hear them when someone else is using them at a high volume. Read other reviews for the more technical side of things, but I really appreciate good sound quality and these headphones are insane.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|My 2 boys were always rewinding the movie to so many different spots that made them laugh. I tought the remake of Horton hears the who was done really well and having a few extras beyond the story line made it fun for me to watch again as well.
0143143492|1.0|My rating is based on the Audio version of this book.  I did not read the book - I was an idiot and bought the CD.  I could not even get through one CD.  The reader is sooooo monotone.  It may be a good book,just don't waste your money on the CD.  Sounds like a computer speaking to you. Unbearable.
B001GKJ2DY|2.0|Please keep in mind that this 2 star rating is from the perspective of a male.  My wife & daughter would surely give this movie 5 stars.   they loved the music, the dancing, the romance, the plot, the actors, everything.  I, on the other hand, got the creeps watching Meryl Streep & Pierce Brosnan try to sing & dance.  Their singing & dancing skills, along with most of the cast, were way below average.  Other than the songs we all know (Waterloo, Mamma Mia, etc.) the rest of the songs were mediocre at best.  The only actor worth watching was the daughter, played by Amanda Seyfried.  She brings a lot of joy to her role and seems to be the only actor not just going through the motions.    Guys, buy this for your wife & daughter and find something else to do while they watch!

I did not realize that you need a special/discontinued DVD player to play it.  My bad. Therefore I returned it.  In this case the low price was too good to be true. I have not fully completed the return process (no credit to my card yet), but I am pleased with Amazon's service with all previous purchases.

No need to discuss the plot here, other reviewers before me have done a fine job of that.  I read it in a couple of days and immediately gave it to my twenty-something daughter, with the instruction \\"you must read this now!\\"  She did and she loved it as well. I definitely see this being made into a movie.  I am waiting eagerly for Ms. Collins' next book.  Hope the wait isn't too long.

B0006A9FKA|4.0|Shaun and his mate Ed are losers who lead a pretty boozed out life after work at their local pub, The Winchester.  When everyone around them starts turning into zombies it takes them a while to notice how bad it is.  When they realise that the only way to kill or stop them is a blow to the head Shaun and Ed head off across London with a cricket bat and a stick to save Shaun's girlfriend and parents.    This movie is played for laughs - but its not so over the top that you can't relate to the characters.  It is a clever take off of Zombie horror movies that nevertheless does have its moments of genuine horror.  If you are fan of horror movies or camp B movies then you should watch this modern take on the genre.  It doesn't strike me as a typical British movie, but it is still one I enjoyed.
0670020745|4.0|At age 37 Jill Bolte Taylor was a neuroanatomist working at Harvard's Brain Bank when she suffered a massive stroke that flooded the left hemisphere of her brain with blood. She was amazed at what was happening to her and thought \\"Isn't this cool!\\" before coming to grips with the reality that she needed help. She was reduced to infanthood in her capabilities to deal with life, but what was left of her scientist's mind kept observing her situation. She realized she'd lost personality traits that were better left lost, so she consciously supervised the return of her left brain functions. It took eight years. Her reflections on this process somewhat parallel Eckhart Tolle's ideas on the need to get away from defensive ego reactions and approach others in a more open and loving manner. She points out that the strong emotional reactions we sometimes experience are physiological in nature and course through our bodies in 90 seconds. By waiting until the physical reaction has passed (\\"count to ten\\") we have much better control over our response. While not a great literary work (grammar mistakes!), My Stroke of Insight is a wonderful story from which much can be learned.
B001KK052W|3.0|My husbands favorite Christmas gift.  He watched 7 of the stories last night and laughed through every one of them.  He is a huge fan of the show and watches it 5 days a week.  With this set of cd's, he can start the entire story lines over and enjoy the shows all the time.  He's looking forward to the release of the 5th season.  Highly recommended for 2.5 men fans or for those who like a good sit-com.
B00006D295|3.0|A middle-class young couple, motoring in the country on their wedding night, have car trouble in front of a huge mansion... Wanting to use the phone, the two approach the house and go in just as its master, Dr. Frank N. Furter, is leading an experiment... His newly made creature, the body-beautiful Rocky, is ready to be unveiled, and the innocent couple is caught up in this strange household filled with the doctor's campy, exotically dressed admirers... Both the wife and the husband are seduced by this garter-belted \\"scientist.\\"<br /><br />The film's first half is fast and funny, with virtually every song a memorable one... But the second half tries to do too much and the film loses much of its potency... Nevertheless, the adorable characters make this a delightful entertainment...
B0013FNC38|5.0|I never heard any of Jason's music until I heard \\"I'm Yours\\" which sparked my interest.  \\"We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things\\" is a great record from the first song to the last.    He is able to mix many different styles throughout that each song is engaging in it's own right and when you are done it all comes together.  Lyrically he is smart, funny and gets you thinking, \\"What was meant there?\\"    I really now am looking forward to what comes next, and will pick up the older CDs, I think he can be one of those who makes special music for awhile.
0618918248|3.0|Evolutionary biologist, Richard Dawkins objects to belief in the kind of God many of us have outgrown: the Big-Daddy-in-the-Sky or Celestial-Parent type of God. It is true that this is the kind of God most people believe in, but many of us have moved beyond the duality of \\"the Creator\\" and \\"the created.\\" Dawkins summarizes and dispenses with more sophisticated theistic thinking in his first chapter. He describes pantheism as using \\"the word God as a non-supernatural synonym for Nature, or for the Universe.\\" His only argument against pantheism or what he calls \\"Einsteinian religion\\" is semantic; he thinks it is misleading and confusing to use the word \\"God\\" as something other than a supernatural being.<br /><br />Dawkins does a drum beat on the theme of if-it's-not-rational-don't-believe-it. He is so incredibly left-brained that you might as well chop out his right brain and throw it away. Overall, I don't have much to quarrel with in his book. However, he is asking us to get rid of religion without putting anything else in its place; and his defense against this objection is a feeble attitude of look-how-wonderful-science-is. In going after fundamentalists and people who take the Bible literally, Dawkins oversells Darwin and evolutionary theory. Personally I never felt that evolution was in conflict with religion.<br /><br />On the very last page Dawkins seems to have remembered his right brain and for the first time he uses the word \\"intuitive.\\" He has been forced into it by consideration of the weird science found in quantum mechanics and cosmology. If you are fundamentalist in your religion, you should probably stay away from this book. But it's an interesting read for those of us who think knowing the nature of reality (the Truth) is more important than whether there's a God or not.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|amazing movie, the acting is really good, love the fact thatitis a classic but also has a little bit of comedy.
B000TEUSJK|3.0|The film builds around one of the most notoriously decadent of the Roman emperors, Caligula... The movie covers his rise to power, his four-year rule, and his bloody assassination... His vile deeds include crashing a wedding and sexually abusing the bride and groom, playing erotic fantasies with his sister (who is also his lover) and turning the Imperial Palace into an exclusive brothel...<br /><br />For a really big-money film, the treatment of the sexual scenes is daringly explicit, but somehow the obsession with it makes the film uneven... It blends very good actors, O'Toole and McDowell, with some simple-minded Penthouse models... The overall effect is disappointing...<br /><br />Guccione does deserve a hand for the exquisite sets, costumes, production values, and very fine cinematography...
B000002ITH|5.0|Not only was this the origional LZ compilation, but also features remixed cuts from the fabulous LED ZEPPELIN box set! I'm sure glad Jimmy Page decided to mix special versions for this! They sure sound better than even the rereleases that are out now! Really good clarity! Not to mention the 3-CD (or cassette) set of this features a good collectors item with interviews with Page, Plant and Jones chatting everything from influences to studio techniques to formation and even Jimmy Page discusses how the box set came about! Not to mention the few radio station liners that were recorded by Jimmy Page that you may hear on the radio from time to time!<br /><br />I'm sure the two-CD set version featuring the songs is still available, but I'm not to sure if the 3-CD set is though! Anyway, this is a great set that all LedHeds should have!

B0013FNC38|5.0|I like this album, alot.  Before I really got into Jason Mraz I heard another guy sing one of his songs, and I thought that's a cool little thing going on there, funky beat, cool lyrics some threw you off balance a little, but cool.<br /><br />The rest of the album is like that.  He has beautiful love songs, and understated sexy songs, and some overstated sexy songs, some are simply funk with good lyrics.<br /><br />My point is the man is versatile and easy on the ears.  I like this album quite a bit.  I've been listening to it every day at least once for a month now.  Good tunage, not normally my bag, but I;m super glad I picked it up, now I want more.
0439796636|5.0|\\"War Horse\\" is a story of courage and endurance by horse and man, conveyed through the destruction that is war. Told from the viewpoint of the horse, the story can draw in the most reluctant reader, as children often feel more empathy for animals than people. Because of descriptions of grueling labor and unsound working conditions for the horses, the book is best directed toward fourth grade and up.<br /><br />Joey, a gorgeous bay with four white stocking legs and a white cross on his forehead, is the War Horse. Albert is his 15-year-old human who trains and loves him. When his father sells the horse to the cavalry for service in World War I, Albert swears to join when he is old enough and find Joey.<br /><br />The insanity of matching a cavalry of horses and riders with sabers against soldiers with rifles and machine guns has to be one of the most insane moments in war history!! One-fourth of the horses are killed in the first battle. All but two die in the next battle this cavalry faces. Joey and his equal, Topthorn, a huge black Arabian, survive, only to be taken as prisoners by the Germans.<br /><br />What Joey and Topthorn face as part of the team to pull the hospital cart to the battle front over and over is made right by kind treatment their German masters give to their wounds and injuries, and treat their fatigue at the end of day. Joey's worse experience comes when he and Topthorn and others must pull the artillery. Because these soldiers are dead tired themselves and also starving, they are not as attentive to the horses.<br /><br />The most horrifying scene occurs when Joey is totally alone and runs and runs from the sound of cannons until he is trapped in No Man's Land, a barren area between the French and English on one side and the Germans on the other. Two rolls of barbed wire separate the land from the trenches. Joey finds himself in this area. What transpires is an incredible and beautiful moment in the midst of an insane war.<br /><br />***<br />SPOILER ALERT! Read no further if you don't like to know anything about a book's ending.)<br /><br />Of course, you must know that Albert is re-united with Joey. How that comes about is purely contrived, but welcomed by a reader weary of the horrors of war for both man and horse.<br /><br />Last week a fourth-grader asked me for a really good book to read. I showed him several. When he saw \\"War Horse,\\" he wanted it at once. The next day he told me, \\"This is a great book.\\" He was already half-way finished. So I went home and read my copy.<br /><br />You will never look at a horse the same way again. Joey tells us about the people who tend him. Are they heavy-handed, hard, tender, kind, caring? What is it like with each type of person? What is it like to be a horse? But the best lesson is that horses are no longer used in battle (until a reader commented that horses are being used in Afghanistan! Barbarity in a barbaric place. What can one expect? Note: I'm speaking of war and war conditions, not the Afghan people or soldiers.)w anything about a book's ending.)  Of course, you must know that Albert is re-united with Joey.

0545128285|5.0|It is a must to read if you are into fairy tales. It provides a different experience by adding Albus Dumbledore's own comments at the end of each tale. This way, reader learns more about the fantastic world of Harry Potter of Rowling. Completely satisfied.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|The first four Disney features are arguably the best ever produced at the studio, and while SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is still a strong and remarkable achievement, PINOCCHIO is an even more impressive one.<br />It is a very dark film--the comedy is sugar coating on a tale of horror where evil characters lurk in every corner, luring innocents from the 'strait and narrow path' into dreadful fates, relieved only after Pinocchio pays a price. The delightful characters and strong story line make PINOCCHIO one of my favorite Disney films.<br />I am very pleased to hear that deleted storyboards and preproduction materials will be included on the disc. It has been a long wait but it will be worth it. I'm eagerly awaiting this disc's release.
1400082773|5.0|A wonderful book - well written and engaging from beginning to end.  Great to get to know the author thru this book.
B001F7MSFW|5.0|The movie itself is, of course, awesome. However, the documentary is the real thing in this set. The the movie making process is rather interesting if you love Guillermo and are curious about how the fantasy is crafted.

0452289963|5.0|I listened to Eckhart Tolle read this book on CD while driving to work.  Yes, it's true that most of what he says has already been said.  I have studied these concepts and even thought about the concepts independent of any study - simple observation and contemplation of the world around us. What is extremely important to note, though, is that each generation needs to here these truths spoken to them by their contemporaries.      It's simply not enough to have the 2000-year-old texts sitting there waiting for us to blow the dust off of them.  We must revisit the same concepts over and over again.  The same truth may be told in different ways, by different people, in different places and in different times.  Ice cream is ice cream, but you have to find the flavor that clicks with you.    Buddhism, for example, is not difficult to understand, but I feel like I'm sitting with my legs crossed behind my head when I'm reading it.  Eckhart Tolle presented the same concepts in a way that made me feel like I was sitting in a comfortable chaise lounge.  The man is a master.  He paints portaits with his words.    Tolle and Buddhism?  Same stuff - big difference in delivery.  To me, it matters.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This game has very simple rules but very attractive and fun for all family members to play. Now our family play this game on a regular basis since we bought it.
B00129H7VS|5.0|If you are a 2nd World War buff like myself,this series is definately for you! Picture and sound quality are excellent and unlike a lot of war movies,it certainly does not 'pull any punches' in favour of one particular side. You realize very early on that,as in all wars,the enemy is using real bullets as well!!! I was also pleasantly surprised that the item arrived several days earlier than the free shipping offer suggested.
B001KMB6X2|3.0|This is not the best movie Vin Diesel has been in and Vin's the only reason I got it.  The action takes a long time to warm up and the storyline is basically the same as \\"Cyborg\\".  It's good for one or two viewings, but that's about all.
B001N26GFC|4.0|Actress Sally Hawkins is getting a lot of attention (and a Golden Globe award) for her starring role as the relentlessly cheerful character Poppy. It's a comedy and character study filled with people you just want to watch. The film is about happiness: the search for it, how we try to maintain it, and the absence of it. And while it doesn't have much of a plot and meanders (in an enjoyable way) there is a big payoff when the film culminates in a revealing scene between Poppy & her driving instructor Scott.
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|I simply loved this movie.  I never saw Dirty Harry - but I have always had and fondness a deep respect for Clint Eastwood.  So when my husband suggested seeing Grand Torino, I was open minded and now - and now I want the DVD!  Yes, even a woman whose collection of DVDs are largely chick-flicks and sci-fi.  This movie is entertaining from beginning to end.  Although I was largely shocked by his terse and offensive coments/racial slurs - he hit the mark and then some - while keeping the audience laughing and longing for more - you just can't help find this crotchety old coger endearing.  I absolutely loved the transformation of this character and the way his relationship with his neighbors transformed - and we get to know what a \\"truly good man\\" he is.  Bravo to the entire cast, and especially Clint Eastwood!  A winner in all regards!
B001KVZ6FC|3.0|It's hard not to like the underlying sweetness of Gran Torino. Eastwood's performance is endearing, as a curmudgeonly veteran with a heart of gold. And there are some decent supporting players, too, like Abney Her as the young Hmong woman who intends to befriend Eastwood's Walt Kowalski whether he likes it or not. It also features some cute scenes as Kowalski tries to make a man out of Sue's younger brother, Thao. For these reasons, Gran Torino is both worth seeing and a three-star film, in my opinion.<br /><br />But, there's a lot that could be better about the movie, too. And ultimately, these flaws keep the film from being much more than a bit of pleasant melodrama. Mostly, it suffers from the same kind of ham-handed plot development -- the kind that feels pre-engineered, predictable, and not smooth enough to be convincing -- that plagues a lot of films pretending to profundity and artistry. Crash, Mystic River, and Gone Baby Gone come to mind. Mind you, it isn't nearly as bad as in these films, but this mechanistic \\"set up\\" of events reflects one thing: a lack of storytelling skill. It feels as if everything is being telegraphed in an obvious way, and the characters are little more than cogs in a \\"here's the point we're going to make\\" lecture. If you're sensitive to this kind of manipulation, the story in Gran Torino is going to be less than satisfying. (I thought Crash was a mediocre movie -- which set the stage for a lot of these \\"clever\\" storylines filled with coincidences and caricatures. Gran Torino feels like it's learned some lessons from Crash and its progeny, but it still suffers from some of the problems.) It also suffers from a couple of mediocre performances (like Christopher Carley as a young priest), but, thankfully, they are mercifully limited.<br /><br />Enjoy Gran Torino for what it is: a sweet, slow-paced story with a nice performance by Eastwood.
B001L4NJIO|1.0|In my opinion, the audio on this blu-ray suffers from dynamic range compression. The tip off is how incredibly loud it is compared to other blu-rays. I have to turn the volume way down to equalize the volume between this and other blu-rays. How do they get it so loud? They sheer off the dynamic peaks in post processing. This results in a sound track you can play loud and this might sound like a cool thing, but dynamic range, air, and detail is what makes music interesting.  It is also true that it is hard to get a great recording in an outdoor arena. Other artists have dealt with this by playing a smaller venue with better acoustics when recording the blu-ray concert video. In this case, it is obvious that a reference quality recording was not the priority. Instead, they simply tried their best to get a decent recording given all of the limitations. The result is not horrible, but it is not sonically impressive, either. If you are looking for a souvenir to remind you of what the show sounded like in an outdoor arena, this will probably do the trick. If you've assembled a nice surround sound system in your home theater and you are looking for demo material to show it off, there are better choices.
B001E5FYS8|4.0|This is a documentary about highwire artist Philippe Petit and the many extraordinary stunts he pulled off in the early 1970s leading up to his \\"dream\\" of walking a wire between the WTC Twin Towers. Petit and the band of men and women he managed to convince to help him pull off his stunts tell their story with such passion and enthusiasm the director almost doesn't need to use actors to recreate the scenes leading up to that day in New York in 1974. It's an engaging tale about wonder, beauty, and art that makes you feel proud to be human; a film that leaves you wanting more.
0316017922|3.0|I've enjoyed a number of Gladwell's books in the past and I find his ability to tell a story while presenting a hypothesis amongst the best in the business.  I cannot deny that I did enjoy Gladwell's latest work in Outliers, but it also generated some curiousity on a few of his foundational arguments.  While there's no question that timing can sometimes provide amazing opportunities, he fails to look at the exceptions that seem to refute his central thesis.    As a big hockey fan, I was enthralled when he said that being born early in the year was a key factor in the success and almost impossible to overcome.  Gladwell explains that the selection process in the Canadian junior leagues determine everything and if you are born in the last three months of the year, there's only a 10% chance of moving on to stardom.  However, as a hockey fan I thought about Patrick Roy, one of the greatest goalies in the NHL of all time, DOB 5-October-1965; Ray Bourque, one of the greatest defensemen of all time, 28-December-1960; Mario Lemieux, undeniably one of the greatest, 5-October-1965; Maurice Richard, 4-August-1921.  While it's true that Gretzky, Orr, Howe and others were born in the first quarter of the year, there's a great number of examples that Gladwell fails to fully explain.    When he's trying to make a book about the exceptions only happen because of a different set of rules for them allowing them to master their greatness ahead of everyone, I expect things to be a little tighter.  The book uses up space that could have filled some of these voids with interesting but off target stories rather than filling in the gaps.  I'm willing to give Gladwell some latitude because he does make arguments so digestable, but not when the arguments have logical faults that could leave open other explanations.
B0015OKWL2|1.0|Ah, I just couldn't wait to buy this movie - De Niro, Pacino!  What could possibly go wrong?  Answer: everything!<br /><br />Take a bad script, add a narrator, and then throw in a few B-level actor wannabes and you have a disaster on film.  This movie is so predictable and boring that I can only imagine Robert and Al were heavily medicated for head colds when they agreed to take lead roles in this project.<br /><br />If it had been any other actors, this movie would have been stopped in the middle of production.  However, many people actually give this movie high ratings, here at Amazon.com, because they know the amazing track record for the two big leaguers!  And I truly can't blame them for that.  Pacino or De Niro sitting in a rocking chair for thirty minutes would probably be a bit interesting, because these two have that IT factor.<br /><br />Two very old, white, NYPD detectives fall under every single clich&eacute; ever invented about cops.  Then they work out in the police weight training room, shoot lots of bullets at targets, talk trash, brag on each other, fight with the younger cops, stand up to the black street thug, and along the way discover they have a vigilante in their midst; wow, how will the audience ever handle the suspense.  Easy, there is none.  In fact, there really isn't a single character in this movie who I found myself rooting for to succeed.  I was actually hoping they all got shot!  Sorry, just being brutally honest; everyone seemed corrupt, arrogant, and void of any good human qualities.<br /><br />Righteous Kill is one of those movies that everyone hoped would live up to the hype.  But when you rely on a cool musical soundtrack and two great movie stars to carry the whole project, you are going to create a mess.  And that is exactly the best way to describe this movie:  A MESS.<br /><br />And CASTING DIRECTORS, please stop putting 50 Cent in movies!  He should not even be an extra in a film.  He cannot act!  He's not even good enough to convince an audience he is a rapper, and he is.<br /><br />Don't believe the hype.  Save your money and 101 minutes of your time.<br /><br />Want suspense and characters you care about?  Watch Bangkok Dangerous!  Now that's a script!<br /><br />See ya next review!is.

0385340567|1.0|I love this series and looked forward so much to this one. If it had been any other writer I would have put it down half way but I was hoping it would become better... unfortunatly I was waiting till the last page.
B000FA5MNU|4.0|Lady Chatterly's Lover was not the perverted, illiterate story I was lead to believe it was.   It was a story of classes and self realization.  It was thoughtfully written, though it did drag in many parts.  Yes, there are many sexual liasons in the story, but I think the author's intent was to make them part of the natural flow of the story instead of a suggestion.  In saying that, it was quite evident the love scenes were written by a man.  Mostly very mechanical in description and very cut and dry.  A female author would have elongated the love scenes and added a bit more detail.  Although the focus of the book has always been the sex scenhes, there is more substance to it than that  .
B000JBWWQ0|3.0|Even since the Celestine Prophecy book came out, I wanted to read it but never have. I have the experiential guides for both this and the 10th insight but have never read the books. I thought I'd start off by watching the video...what a disappointment this turned out to be. I really did not like this film and it has put me off reading the book. It's too violent and dark and apart from the sometimes pretty scenery, there wasn't much else to hold your attention. They sometimes spat out a bit of spiritual talk but it was not a deeply spiritual movie and I'm sure it doesn't do the book justice at all. I don't really want to watch it again, very disappointing.
0061537934|5.0|A story told through the eye's, mind and heart of a dog can be tear producing and funny.  The actions and reactions that occur become clear and the emotions run heavy at times.  Racing in the rain becomes an aspect of life and coping with the setbacks and joys of living are metaphorically produced.  It was a book I could hardly put down and made me axious to read another of Stein's books.
B001G9FFM2|5.0|Great CD by itself. The addition of the DVD makes it even better. If you bought the original, as I did, when it was first released, don't be discouraged from plunking down the added $ on this. The DVD by itself would be a good deal. The extra songs on the CD make it a no-brainer. This was one of the best metal discs released in 2007. If you don't already own it, what are you waiting for?
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Simply Amazing! Inspired by the writer's strike, this fantastic original webcast has finally been released as a bakers' dozen - that it you get the entire series of 3 parts, plus a little extra. The story is great, the acting stellar and the music is pure Whedon. Not give you the usual DVD and extras, there is an entire 2nd musical on the extras portion: \\"Commentary: the Musical\\". This is one disc you will watch over and over again. And laugh with every viewing and maybe cry with some.
B001FSDOZO|4.0|I have been a Nickelback fan since Silver Side up came out and have all of their albums, including Curb. Been to some of their concerts and always thought they totally rocked. After a break of several years, they finally put out a new album which we all anxiously awaited and what a disappointment! The lyrics are so gross you can't even listen to it in front of children. I think Chad has spent too much time around Kid Rock and it's rubbed off on him and his song writing. Something in your mouth would probably appeal to teens but when you get older, it sounds crude, cheap and tacky. I know Chad can do alot better than this. It's a polished studio album produced by Shania's ex and sounds good but some of the lyrics are terrible. I much prefer their previous albums to this one. Had I not been a fan of theirs, this would have got a much lower rating.
0545128285|2.0|I thought I would love this book, I believed it was a story about another wizard from Rowling's world.  But it is a group of short stories like fairy tales for kid.  Not great, just ok.  Get it from the library, but I would not add it to your own personal library.

1573223085|5.0|A whole New Mind is the kind of book that changes the way you are thinking the world. Daniel H. Pink explains in a brilliant and funny style why you need to take actions on your self-education if you don't want to be left behind in the \\"Conceptual-Age\\".<br /><br />  A metaphor is used throughout the book to explain the challenges we are facing:<br /><br />1. Left-brain thinking: logical, automatic, rigorous thoughts characterizing most of the engineering jobs.<br /><br />2. Right-brain thinking: sentiments, feelings, inventiveness that are characteristics of pioneers and people thinking out of the box.<br /><br />  People only using left-brain thinking used to be the most successful during the last century. However, the rules of the game are changing because competition (in engineering for instance) is set to a much higher level with globalization. Therefore, it becomes necessary to develop new skills that are:<br /><br />a)not done cheaper by someone else overseas<br />b)not replicable by a software<br />c)satisfying a real demand<br /><br />  The main idea is that combining left-brain thinking together with right-brain thinking in a \\"symphony\\" is the key to success.
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|I bought this as a present for someone who likes Enya and has all her albums. To me, it sounded like a typical Enya album with all the Enya sounds and music. The cover is pretty and the CD insert. I couldn't really understand what the lyrics were about but it sounded acceptable and not irritable. It's something I could listen to while watching the snow falling outside. It's peaceful and serene and a nice floaty feeling and should please most Enya fans.
B0018M6J90|5.0|Fantastic service and arrived in the time that was estimated. Will try and use this service again!
B0001CCXZW|2.0|I thought that by buying the dvd directly from Amazon that they would both be new. I bought the first and second season from them. The second season arrived perfect but the first one did not. Even though it was wrapped in plastic the plastic case that holds the dvds falls out and I had to glue it back in. Also, the paper manual that comes in the disc looked like someone had cut it. It was very odd.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Great all the DVDs in one box great guide, and a lot better than buying each season seperate. I love Girlmore Girls and now i can watch it straight through whenever i want, without commercials!

B0015D3Z4O|4.0|This is another rocking album by one of my faves.  Numbers 1-5 rock me out but it gets a bit redundant the next few songs.  The rest of the album is very good though!
B001E2JNA6|5.0|This is by far the best production that has been created. I would recommend this to anyone!!
B000000ZGO|5.0|Excellent CD by Isaac Hayes. This is maybe one of the best records of soul music from the 70's. Long songs. A very good drummer and of course a good voice, nice chorus and  good keyboards. Impressive.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|As a guitarist myself, I guess I have a difficult time understanding some of the negative reviews of Systematic Chaos:    1. If you don't enjoy progressive, \\"self-indulgent\\" music, why check out any of DT's albums at all?    2. There are better melodies on this album than on any of their previous albums (Prophets of War is a perfect case in point).    3. Although I like James LaBrie's voice on all past albums, it can get a bit piercing at times.  This is rarely the case, however, on Systematic Chaos.    4. (Not that any of their previous albums are lacking in licks, but...)  Systematic Chaos contains some of the most intense displays of unfettered chops ever recorded while remaining melodic and musical.    All in all, I really cannot comprehend the negative reviews.  While not perfect, Systematic Chaos is easily my favorite album in the last two years, and the recording quality is one the best I've ever heard.  Crank it up!    -Greg
B000JJS8TM|5.0|It takes a bit of getting used to for the diehard Beatles fans who have every note of every song running through their veins.  Once you get used to it, it is exhilirating!  You wouldn't think anything more could be done with these songs, but George Martin and his son have created yet another masterpiece!
0780626966|5.0|I remember when the first Nightmare On Elm Street came out, you already knew pretty much how to deal with Jason but someone who could enter your dreams and kill you in your dreams was more problematic.  I knew I had to at least get this box set before it was gone and I am definitely happy to have done it.  I know not all the movies were great out of the set I say the ones that are the best were The first, The third, The fourth, The Fifth(But that's really pushing it), and The seventh and technically final movie.  Sadly the second movie tried to be a sequel to the first but fell flat and just became to much of a teenager slasher flick with no true horror, and the sixth one was beyond the word horrible with the added bonus of trying to say Freddy had a daughter.  Nowadays most people who didn't grow up during the 80's might not treasure Freddy as much but for those of us who did and still remember that haunting child song \\"One, Two Freddy's coming for you\\" will treasure this set the most.  The video for all the movies is nicely clear and sharp surprising for some of the movies considering their age, and of course seeing Robert Englund as our beloved Freddy still brings the fear.  The audio is also done very well for this set giving us the 5.1 surround sound for all the movies is nice as well.  So for the fans of Freddy, for people looking for a nice 80's horror movie, or just people looking for more of Freddy after seeing Freddy VS Jason I say for the great price of this box set here's a great purchase for your collection....

B000MV9026|5.0|I'm usually not too big on kids movies, especially animated ones, but this one is different.   Just had to get it for the grandkids.  Great messages on ecology, diversity, perserveance, and being true to yourself and what you believe in.  I love the characters, & of course the music and dancing.
0786838655|5.0|\\"The Lightning Thief\\" is definitely a fun continuation of those stories for both young and old audiences.  It seems the Greek legends are still among us and living pretty much as they always did.      Percy Jackson's a kid in trouble.  He's got ADHD and has been kicked out of every private school he's gone to.  I knew I was in love with this kid when he disappeared his math teacher.     Turns out, he's a half blood and the son of one of the Big Three (Zeus, Poseidon, Hades) of the Greek gods.  His Mom's been keeping him undercover all these years.  When he and his mother are under threat, they run to the only safe place, a summer camp for all the other children of the gods.    There, Percy learns his true heritage and is sent on a quest with his satyr friend Grover and half-blood daughter of Athena, Annabelle.  They've got to settle a feud between the gods.  And they've got to face some of the scariest legends in Greek mythology to do it.    Okay, the book's for 5-8th graders, but I had a blast reading it.  The humor's good and the pacing's fast.  I very much enjoyed the saga and would probably pick up another volume of it at a later date.     Rebecca Kyle, January 2009
0061245097|5.0|This is my favorite book in the series.  I love Cat and Bones! I wish Bones would call me Kitten!
0767836286|4.0|Maybe because I expected some of the normal heavy-handed Liberal bias in here with Tim Robbins, I was pleasantly surprised. Oh, it was there but on the mild side. What I found, basically, was an interesting thriller with good suspense and good clever twists at the end. It was nicely filmed, too, and I liked the lower-key atmosphere in here.    Another pleasant surprise was Joan Cusack, who was very effective as Robbins' creepy wife. If you're paranoid, you should like this story. I owned the DVD and traded it, but would like to see it again. It's worth several looks if you wait long enough between viewings to forget some of those twists.
B00068TJM6|4.0|Overall I'm very satisfied with this purchase. Only drawback - the alarm can be a lil complicated.
6305609705|5.0|Well, I've watched this movie for about 30 years now and it's still almost as interesting as when I first saw it. It is definitely one of the most unique films ever made.  If or when it comes out in high-definition, I'll buy it.    I still think Martin Sheen got \\"dissed\\" big-time in the billing, too. He dominates the film yet gets lesser billing than Marlon Brando, who only appears in the last 30 minutes (in the theatrical version). How unfair is that? Sheen is fantastic in here, especially with his narration, which runs throughout. His voice is just haunting as he relates his thoughts on this incredible, nightmare-like adventure.     The other thing that strikes me about the film over the years are the number of memorable scenes, ones I have never forgotten. I'm pretty sure everyone would share that opinion; it's a film you don't forget!
0312427999|5.0|As a student of political economy I try to read as many works on the subject as possible to complement the work done in the classroom. I was blown away by the unparalleleded level of research and scathing analysis by Klein. The book works as a thorough account of Friedman econ. in action but I find it functions better as a way to demonstrate how democracy and capitalism oppose each other more often than not (1 person=1 vote VS. $1=1 vote). I found the statistical/factual evidence in the book to be quite accurate as I double checked sources and researched the events in question. The book is quite meaty but the 70+ pages of end notes will keep you busy for hours fleshing her sources out.      The time spent looking at the effects of Chicago school econ. in Latin America, Iraq, and Post-Soviet E. Europe is only matched by the time spent looking at how the econ. was made possible in the first place, through fear, confusion, torture, coercion, or as Naomi puts it, Shock. There's simply too many points of information to dwell upon here (she documents Chicago style econ. virtually everywhere it was implemented) but I will say I was most impressed at how well she looped everything together. With out conspiracy theories, speculation, or exaggeration she successfully linked, Corporatism, the Military Industrial Complex, US foreign intervention, the war on terror, and Chicago school of economics in one flawless avalanche of carefully placed facts.     I would recommend  \\"Shock Doctrine\\" to be read in conjunction with Cambridge economist HA-Joon Chang's \\"Bad Samaritans\\". Klein demonstrates how Friedmanism fails to bring basic needs to the people and is almost always accompanied by a democratic deficit while Chang explores how the economics of the Friedman's (Thomas and Milton) are flawed in their entirety.      Tremendous book! Most important piece of literature I've read on political economy thus far.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|IF YOU ENJOY ROMANTIC MUSICALS (WITH A LITTE LAUGHTER) THIS WOULD BE THE MOVIE TO BUY.  I SAW IT FOUR TIMES IN THE THEATER AND BOUGHT THE DVD THE MINUTE IT WAS OFFERED.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|This modern-day version has an aesthetically pleasing cast and set although it does not stay true to the book.  So if you are a fan of Ms. Austen, watch the BBC version; otherwise, you will be disappointed.  However, if you are in the mood for a chick flick period piece or love fluff (think Marie Antoinette costumes, decor, etc), you'll enjoy it.  Plus, anyone who has every been to the UK or loves its scenery will just be delighted in this modern version!
B000MXPE7O|4.0|I'm still not sure what happens at the conclusion here. And it is, after all, more than 2.5 hours long, an eternity by today's movie standards. Matt Damon is a little less than convincing as the cold warrior, but this gathers steam, overall, and I did manage to watch it all at one sitting, which is saying something for a long movie. Even Angelina Jolie isn't bad as the neglected wife who just wants to have fun. Flawed, but not a throw-away either.
B000YAA68C|5.0|This romantic comedy makes light of a terrible situation with humor, adventure, and love.  Bravo for the music selection!  You will laugh and cry but, inevitably, fall in love with the message! Chick flick!
B001676320|5.0|We recently purchased a blu-ray dvd machine, so we have rented and watched several blu-ray DVD's.  We really like attending concerts so went to see Chicago perform and after the concert we went back to buy a DVD and they were sold out but they told us look for the Chicago and Earth Wind & Fire Blu-Ray at the Greek Theatre and you will enjoy a recording that is almost like being there.  We went to Amazon, who 99.9% has everything and found this Blu-Ray DVD.  When we received it, and played it on our 70\\" lcd high def TV I could NOT believe how real the sound and the video was.  It was like being there.  Best I have ever seen.  Get IT!!
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|Despite a beautiful cast, lovely costumes, and pretty settings, this movie was disappointing.  I read the book first and you should, too.  If you have read it, please note that this movie does no justice to the book aside from giving you some idea of what those times may have been like.  That said, I don't ever expect movies to be as good as books but this one takes the cake.  Honestly, such a disappointment - they manage to put in maybe 1/3 of the storyline.  It gets two stars for trying and for aesthetics.  Otherwise, it sucks.  I wanted to like this movie b/c I am a sucker for period pieces.  Unfortunately, I think the Tudors (on Showtime) is doing more justice to this period and the book itself than this adaptation.  Moving on...

B00005MP58|5.0|Unlike the modern version with Keira, this BBC version follows the novel diligently and tries to capture the true spirit of the times.  Jane Austen would be proud!! :) And Colin Firth fulfills the role of Mr. Darcy with incredible nobility and charm.  A true white knight!
B00139W3NE|3.0|Overall, pretty good, and better than I expected.<br />I actually had attempted the book before I saw the movie.  And for me, the book didn't hook me.  I had a hard time believing in the world, added to the fact that the story flowed very slowly in the beginning, which left me without a burning desire to finish the book (I stopped when she boarded the ship).<br />The movie, though slow in the beginning like the book, did pick up quite a bit as it went along.  I was impressed with visual effects, loved the variety of characters (and actors they got to do the voices), and enjoyed the adventure that was unfolding.  While the movie still contained some areas in the foundation that I questioned, had enough strengths and action to keep me moving along without stopping to focus too much on what I didn't believe.<br />Though I don't believe I'd pick up the series again to read, I would watch the next movie in the series.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I watched the streams when they were released, but I just had to own this true piece of internet history! Now I usually don't like DvDs because I don't think the extras are worth it (I watch it once on TV, and that's usually good enough for me), but this thing is packed with extras.<br /><br />You get the 3 wepisodes (~45 minutes), then you get a musical commentary (which has little to do with what's happening on-screen but is HALARIOUS) which spans the full 45 minutes again.  THEN you get a normal commentary and it's great because you can tell they all had fun making it and are having a great time doing the commentary for it too (once again spans all 3 episodes).  BUT WAIT, there's MORE! You then get a behind the scenes/making of as well as some amusing Evil League of Evil applications from fans (2-3 really good fan videos, a couple not so good, but amusing).<br /><br />The DvD is completely worth it ESPECIALLY at ~$20 with shipping (to Canada).  I've since taken this DvD over to my friends' houses and forced them to watch it! But they thanked me after words!
B001M5UDGS|4.0|Blows my mind that I missed this on the web. Being a fan of almost everything Joss has put out I can't understand how I missed this one. Only loses one star since you can get it for nearly free other ways and it is a little on the short side. It is very funny and well worth seeking out.

B001LRJH0K|4.0|Once, which seems like ages ago now the Western was the most popular genre in film; it seemed like every major release was a Western and like most genres there might come a time to where the genre film might have weak sales, but than bounce back. The Western though has never really made a comeback. The Western seems like something of the ghost of Hollywood past. Every so often a Western will be made and some have been decent sized hits it seems most break even or flop. There just isn't a market for these movies anymore and nowadays it's the modern day Western being made; the modern day Western takes the elements of a Western, but obviously set in modern day.<br /><br />Every couple of years the Western returns and mostly they break even or are moderate hits; Appaloosa was a movie that I really wanted to see, but it only got a limited release and while it was playing in my City it was rather far out from where I live so I didn't get a chance to see it, which was probably a good thing. Based on the previews one would think Appaloosa is a shoot `em up since the trailer shows mostly action, but that's hardly what Appaloosa is. The action scenes are very brief and would probably only add up to maybe a minute of the running time. Had I seen the movie upon its release I probably wouldn't have liked it since I'd be expecting something totally different. I'm not really sure why Appaloosa got an R-rating. I've seen plenty of PG-13 movies made the last couple of years that feature far more violence than Appaloosa.<br /><br />Appaloosa is very much a character driven movie and doesn't rely on action to advance the movie and thankfully the characters in Appaloosa are excellent as are the performances by the cast. I've never read the novel the movie is based upon so I cannot compare the two or how true the movie stays to the book.<br /><br />The screenplay was written by Robert Knott & Ed Harris and the script was very solid and is quite simple and that's why it works so well; there's nothing really spectacular about the characters, but they all work well for the most part and the main characters Virgil Cole played by Ed Harris and Everett Hitch played by Viggo Mortensen are two great characters and they work so well because they are simple characters and very likeable and noble. What makes Virgil and Everett work so well is they aren't the typical heroes. I think it was a great change of pace than the norm. Knott & Harris really do a solid job with the screenplay and the fact it's a simple straight forward story makes it even better.<br /><br />Besides co-writing and starring Ed Harris also directed Appaloosa and this is his 2nd feature film and I really hope Ed Harris does some more directing. He's a terrific and underrated actor, but he's also an excellent director. The pacing of the movie is slow, but never boring and the story is always moving forward I do think a few minutes could have been edited to help the pacing a little more, but again it's never boring. The action scenes are very brief, but they work well. Don't expect a long and drawn out action scenes; they're brief, but work well, but I do feel the final showdown was slightly anti-climatic, while it worked, but this was the one action scene that could have been slightly longer. Ed Harris clearly has an eye for Westerns and he makes one of the better ones over the last few years.<br /><br />Like I said earlier don't go in expecting a shoot `em up; this isn't anything like the remake of 3:10 to Yuma. Appaloosa is more of a character study and the plot set up seems like the typical Western with Everett and Virgil brought into Appaloosa to clean it up of the outlaws, but despite the plot again Appaloosa features little action and more focus on the characters. Ed Harris is great as Virgil Cole, Harris gives a terrific offbeat performance and Viggo Mortensen is quickly moving up the ranks as one of my favorite actors. This role is a lot more laid back compared to his recent roles,Everett is a man of few words, but Viggo once again delivers a knockout of a performance as does Ed Harris and the two actors work amazing together.<br /><br />Jeremy Irons as Randall Bragg makes for an excellent if not underused villain. Irons plays a good part in the movie, but I would have liked to have seen a bigger part in the movie. Like I said Jeremy Irons makes for a good villain, but the part wasn't big enough for the viewer to really dislike him. Renee Zellweger does well in the role of Allison French, but I did feel her character didn't really add much. Had her scenes could have been mostly edited out it wouldn't hurt the movie one bit. Not that her scenes hurt the movie or anything, but her character was the least interesting of the lot.<br /><br />Sadly Appaloosa only got a limited release and in the age of big special F/X this movie will probably get lost in the shuffle and be forgotten about. And the fact it features very little action your average moviegoer will probably be bored. But with that said Appaloosa is an excellent Western that's driven by the characters rather than the action. If you want a big shoot `em up check out the excellent 3:10 to Yuma, but if you want more of a crime/drama with some suspense and comedy thrown into the mix Appaloosa is worth a viewing. In my opinion Appaloosa was one of the top films of 08 and hopefully finds its audience.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks beautiful; the transfer is top notch and the sound quality is amazing. I haven't seen the DVD so I don't know how it looks, but the extra features are the sameonce again delivers a knockout of a performance as does Ed Harris and the two actors work amazing together.

B001AXOFS4|5.0|In the first few minutes of this album, you start wondering what all the fuss was about Amy Winehouse.  Adele, a classmate of Amy's at the BRIT school, smashes through the pack of today's mediocre voice talents.  Though Amy Winehouse is a very good singer, Adele's surpasses her more famous classmate with superior musicality, maturity and tone.  Nearly all the songs on the two-disc set (live and studio recorded) are excellent, and a hefty percentage of them were written by Adele.  The next step for Adele is to lean less on the voice acrobatics, something she does only a tad too much.  Her strong voice, centered-pitch and ability to mix music and lyrics into something that transcends both are a strong enough signature.  I very much look forward to future albums from this promising young talent.    Also, get the two-disc set.  Almost any current singer out there can sound good in studio recordings.  Adele's live performances (disc 2) are even better than the studio recordings and underscore just how impressive an artist she is.
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|This movie is just really one of the greatest that I've seen in 2008. Great cast! The late Heath Ledger, Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Cilian Murphy, Maggie Gyllenhaal. In this film we see The Batman (Bale) go against a dirtier, meaner, more evil version of The Joker (Ledger) that is just perfect for 2008.

B00138J1XK|4.0|If you're looking for a single disk 'best of Kansas', you might want to check out [[ASIN:B001D7DWOA Playlist: The Very Best Of Kansas]]. It's two bucks cheaper right now and it includes one of Kansas' best songs, \\"Miracles Out Of Nowhere\\" from the album \\"Leftoverture\\". From \\"Point of Know Return\\" it includes \\"Portrait (He Knew)\\" which got quite a bit of airplay when that album came out.<br /><br />But really, occasionally the album that put a band on the map in the first place is better than attempts at compiling singles or heavy airplay songs. Such is the case with this collection vs. [[ASIN:B00138EVDK Leftoverture]]. \\"Leftoverture\\" was strong, start to finish, not a smidgen of gristle on that one. Based on its strength I bought the album before it ([[ASIN:B00138JAC2 Song For America]]) and after it ([[ASIN:B00138KIH8 Point Of Know Return]]), and a friend of mine picked up Kansas' [[ASIN:B00138CY1G debut album]]. Each of those albums had moments but the keeper was \\"Leftoverture\\".<br /><br />Try \\"Leftoverture\\" first, and if you're in dire need of a particular song from the best of, download it as an individual track. If you need to save a couple bucks, dispense with the two live bonus tracks appended to the current edition of \\"Leftoverture\\" and just download the original eight songs.

There's no need to discuss the three singles that also appeared on the first Greatest Hits, you've heard 'em, you know whether you like 'em.

A six or seven minute instrumental, something unique in the Eagles' catalog, and it maintains interest for the duration of the track.<br /><br />The album's weakness is that the rockers just don't hold their own. Of the six non-single tracks, \\"Visions\\" and \\"Too Many Hands\\" are the two rockers, and unfortunately they're the two weakest tracks on the album. The remaining three ballads make this the mellowest of the Eagles' albums. None are on a par with the ballads from the [[ASIN:B0011Z7JO8 Desperado]] album such as \\"Bitter Creek\\", \\"Saturday Night\\" or \\"Tequila Sunrise\\" but they hold their own.<br /><br />In spite of any shortcomings, for my money this was the last solid Eagles album. When the CD era came along I surprised myself by snapping up the first four Eagles albums almost immediately; I'd always enjoyed those Eagles albums on vinyl but never particularly thought of myself as a fan. But sometimes our actions reveal our priorities and when the CD era arrived I found that my appreciation of the Eagles had grown over time.<br /><br />The Eagles released three albums after this before breaking up (the first time) - [[ASIN:B0011Z78R6 Hotel California]], [[ASIN:B001202TLK The Long Run]], and [[ASIN:B0011ZVPK2 the live album]]. If you have the affordable [[ASIN:B0011Z8SJS Greatest Hits Volume 2]] you've got all you need from those more rock-AOR days. But do yourself a favor and check out the first four Eagles albums, with [[ASIN:B0011Z7JO8 Desperado]] and [[ASIN:B001200H2I On The Border]] being the crowning glories.

B00138J9VE|4.0|Rather than repeat the history and analyses posted by others, I'll take the \\"if you're sampling Gentle Giant by downloading mp3s from a variety of albums\\" tack here.<br /><br />Of the six tracks, \\"Schooldays\\" would be the clear winner for inclusion when burning an 80 minute 'best of, volume one'. The opener, the mostly instrumental \\"Prologue\\", also wouldn't be a bad choice. \\"Peel the Paint\\" has a catchy hook to it but the live version on [[ASIN:B002SWQR1O Playing The Fool]] delivers more punch.<br /><br />Had Gentle Giant been playing the singles game in those days, \\"Mr. Class and Quality\\" would have been the most likely candidate for being issued on a promotional disk to FM radio. We all have friends and loved ones who might not be able to appreciate what Gentle Giant was doing, but this track and \\"Isn't It Quiet And Cold\\" from the [[ASIN:B000W03J38 debut album]] I've found to be among the more easily accepted among those not inclined toward prog.<br /><br />On the whole, this is where Gentle Giant started finding their sound. The next album, [[ASIN:B005JOHORO Octopus]], would perfect that sound, and the four studio albums following it - [[ASIN:B002SXSQ2Q In A Glass House]], [[ASIN:B002SXXGBC The Power And The Glory]], [[ASIN:B002SXUCS2 Free Hand]], and [[ASIN:B002SXZVWY Interview]], would raise the bar.

0061142026|5.0|Most of you probably know about Stardust by now. You have either read the book or seen the movie (while different, both mediums portray the same basic points, with some minor deviations). Stardust is the story of Tristran Thorn, an inhabitant from the town of Wall whose mysterious birth is only the beginning of an exciting, cross-generational adventure. You see, Tristran's mother isn't from the town of Wall, or from anywhere you and I have ever been. She's from beyond the wall that lies on the edge of Wall, from a world of magic and fantasy. Tristran, however, is very much from our world, in love with one Victoria Forrester (who is far less of a stuck up wench as she is in the movie), and generally not at all hero material. But, as young love usually goes, Tristran makes an outlandish promise to Victoria after a shooting star lands beyond the wall: in exchange for his Heart's Desire he will bring back that fallen star and present it to her. And thus begins the adventure.<br /><br />Something tells me I should have read this book a long time ago--my fiance will claim credit, because she rightly deserves credit for getting me to read this book. Stardust is a modern fairytale that merges the dark reality of the Grimm Brothers with the charming feel that comes with the territory. Another way to describe it is to say that it's a novel that tries to bring the frivolity of fairytales into the modern world by making it much more than just a story. Tristran's journey is one into manhood as he goes from being a pimply, shy youth to a full-grown, well-into-his-own young man.<br /><br />But I don't think Tristran is all that makes this novel so charming. True, his journey is wonderful--meeting Yvaine, falling in love, growing up to become a better person, etc.--but coupled with Tristran and Yvaine is the fantastic world that Gaiman has created. This is a world of unicorns, witches, evil kings and princes, and flying ships. The depth provided in such a small book (194 pages) is really quite astonishing. Gaiman has pulled together a fantasy world that feels real despite its leanings towards the fairytale feel. I think this is particularly admirable considering what Gaiman's novel is trying to do: bring the fairytale into the modern.<br /><br />To some extent you can say that Gaiman's novel isn't even a single tale, but a connection of multiple tales. After all, there are multiple stories going on behind the scenes: the witch story, the Stronghold story, and the story of Tristran's mother. These stories have their own conclusions, some of them directly related to Tristran, and some not, but all interconnected with Tristran either through his mother or through Yvaine (the star). Of course, the conclusions to these alternate stories are left out of the movie, or altered to be more interesting to a visual audience, but in the novel they add different elements to an already fascinating story--some of alterations make sense and others make you realize that the book really is quite better (but the movie was still darn good for what it was, which is more than I can say for other movies based on books, *cough* Eragon *cough*).<br /><br />With all that said, all the dark, somewhat macabre imagery, the fairytale feel, the characters, and even the love story (especially the love story, for personal reasons) drove this one home for me (home being that place where books I will always remember go). It's a beautiful story and for someone who hasn't read Gaiman I think it is a great introductory novel. I see now why Gaiman is such a fantasy visionary. Stardust is simply a fantastic novel, no pun intended, and if you haven't read it, I recommend you do. There's not much else I can say to praise this one enough. I can't even say I see anything necessarily wrong with the novel, because once you get into it, everything else seems to fall away and it feels almost as if you're actually there, watching from above as everything goes on below you. Too bad Gaiman's world isn't real, because I would love to ride on a unicorn myself.d love to ride on a unicorn myself.

B000UNYK3A|2.0|Perhaps some reviewers are right and Roth's intentions were honorable. May be one can find allusions to *Abu Chirab*. Unfortunately, the bottomless pit of the \\"obscene superego\\" - that the Hostel's torture chambers represent - is (mis)located in the country of Slovakia, instead of an affluent town of the suburban America. This is because, conveniently, there is an untapped reservoir of Soviet-style and Russian-style spooky *otherness* which could only be produce by locating this sadistic macabre in one of the Slavic country of the east instead of the affluent suburb of Denver or LA. And one can make films on a shoestring budget over there as a bonus. The *obscene superego*, *supreme Being-in-Evil* - something which is placed beyond the symbolic or imaginary order of America - is geographically in the former *eastern block*. But, I think, though it is misplaced, nevertheless, it is still the American mental universe. May be Roth's massage was that that universe is not healthy. Or may be there was no message and he was in for the money. And the money he made.

My son LOVES this book, and it has already started him on the way to being prepared for the arrival of his new little sister.  He is now excited about helping with the baby, and he is always asking if he can hold the baby.  We had talked about the baby before, but this book really has helped.  My son can't get enough of it, and now recites the words from memory at the same time I read them.  I highly recommend this book to expecting families!

0525951113|5.0|When I first ordered this book, I was somewhat worried it'd be yet-another-Terminator-story, but it was not.  Rather, the story is about a man who created a Warcraft-like online game that uses that expertise to gain a lot of power and influence in the real world - after he's dead.  The \\"daemon\\" is merely his tool.    This was quite a page turner.  Suarez writes excellent action, and unlike many tech-thriller writers, he actually knows what he's talking about in the software engineering and system administrator realms.  There is also clearly an opening for a sequel, which I hope to see.

0316168815|2.0|The first half of this book was nothing short of a revelation to me.  I started reading at 10pm and I literally could not put it down -- sheer exhaustion is the only reason I finally did lay it on my nightstand to go to sleep at 3am.  Unfortunately, the second half of this book falls disastrously apart.  The book loses focus -- I couldn't understand where it was going and found myself bored and asking myself why I was still reading.  There are at least three characters who seem to have no purpose in the story  (Ruana, Hal, Nate).     It is possible that I'm not smart enough to \\"get it,\\" but it just felt like Sebold meant to utilize these characters in later scenes that got edited out.  They just kind of hang there and when I finished I was like, \\"Huh?\\"  Is Hal really there just to provide the location for the bike shop interlude?  Is Ruana there to provide foreign cigarettes to Abigail?  Is Nate mentioned over and over again, just to provide an explanation for Buckley's wherabouts in the first half of the book?  Did I miss something?    I see that the book has been optioned as a film -- the synopsis for the film reads that a murdered girl must weigh her desire for vengeance against her desire to have her family find peace.  That synopsis offers a drastic departure from  the book -- in the latter, Susie Salmon never has a desire for vengeance... she is accepting, at peace, and detached from her own violent death.  What keeps her around is what I would describe as a general curiosity about how her death impacts and changes the dynamics within her family.  Although this is interesting in the first half, it drove me crazy in the second half.  If she's at peace, why is she hanging around for so long?   We're forced to observe along with her, a family blindly muddling through the aftermath of a terrible tragedy.  But.... the reality is not that interesting.  It's just sad and unfortunate and you hope the family finds some measure of meaning and peace in life...... but this is not enough to sustain 150 pages of meandering prose.  Susie's detached curiosity doesn't jive with the reader's desire for vengeance/resolution... for structure -- sure, I wanted to know what happened to her family, but I also wanted her murderer to get caught.  But Sebold is only interested in the former... which leaves the story treading water instead of driving forward in the second half.     Someone else mentioned two misguided scenes -- I agree 100%.  One is where Susie gets the opportunity to experience a little bit of heaven on earth (Sebold is trying to go for bittersweet, but it was ridiculous to me) and the second is something thrown in to sate the reader's desire for resolution of one of the main story lines (so silly it was almost offensive) .      I'm interested to see the movie, b/c in the end I think giving Susie's character a desire for vengeance will give the film the much-needed structure that is woefully missing from the book. There is the potential for something really interesting, touching, and the key is making it about Susie's desire to FIND peace -- since the story is told from her perspective, the reader/viewer needs to connect to her emotional journey.

One could be fooled into thinking the album was finished prior to his death.  I know the songs were put out on 'New Rays Of The Rising Sun' but to me this is tighter.  'Freedom', 'Angel', 'Drifting' are all great.  'Straight Ahead' jams.  Basically, it's all good.  Get it if you can.  You won't be sorry.

031606792X|2.0|**WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS****  I LOVED the first three Twilight saga books.  New Moon is my favorite because I am (well, actually was) firmly on Team Jacob and Meyer developed that character well in that book.  I did not like Breaking Dawn.    First, one of the strengths of the first three books were the metaphorical references to abstinence,  resisting temptation, and the cautionary tales against marrying/dating someone of a different faith.  Well, all that goes to \\"hell\\" (pardon my french here) in BD.  Bella gets married to Edward and they live happily ever after.  What?  In the first 3 books, Meyer did so much to foreshadow Bella's death and destruction for involving herself with a vampire and then she ends the story like a Disney fairy tale.  I was shocked and dismayed.    Second, no one dies.  There is supposed to be a battle of apocalyptic proportions against the most powerful vampires in the world, but everyone survives without a scratch. How convenient.....and unrealistic.  As an adult reader, I felt offended by this.  I cried for a straight half hour when Dumbledore died.  I mourned him for weeks.  ANd I applauded Rowling for having the guts it took to kill him off.  Rowling had enough respect for her readers to know we could handle the death of a beloved character.  Apparently Meyer does not think we can handle death during a major battle scene.  Also, the addition of all the new vampires in BD was distracting.  I spent too much time remembering them and they added very little to the story.  And the whole thing of \\"we just need you to witness for us, but you really dont have to fight\\" was ridiculous.  Like anyone for one second thought the Volturi would buy that.  And finally, the whole Renesme thing bothered the heck out of me. Her name was ridiculous.   Jacob's imprinting on the baby was a cheap way out of the most important conflict in the saga: the love triangle between Bella, Edward, and Jacob.  Once again, Meyer does not seem to like confrontation and conflict.  What a cop-out!  All in all, you have to read the book, because it answers the question regarding Bella's immunity to some vampire offenses, like Edward's mind reading.  However, this book is not nearly as good as the first three and leaves the reader feeling cheated.

B000002JSZ|4.0|AC/DC's `Flick of the Switch' was initially a disappointment upon its release in August of 1983. Sales wise it paled in comparison to its immediately predecessors `Back in Black' and `For Those About to Rock' but in terms of overall quality it has been given an historical revision. I believe it is a better album in terms of sound quality and songs then `FTAR'. What hurt `Flick' in the marketplace was the lack of an obvious anthem, especially compared to `FTAR'. Taking over the production duties from Mutt Lange, Angus and Malcolm Young cranked up the guitars to make this lp the band's heaviest since the days of Vanda/Young.  Key songs include the title track which although not an anthem, is a tour-de-force example of the power of AC/DC, \\"Guns for Hire\\", \\"Rising Power\\" and \\"Bedlam in Belgium\\".  \\"Badlands\\" is an underrated song though the lyrics are repetitive compared to \\"Guns\\".   There is a good portion of filler on the record, can't say I'm a big fan of the faster tunes (both original album side closers) but no more than the previous record.  AC/DC fans could do much worse than making `Flick of the Switch' a purchase to fill out the catalogue, rarely has AC/DC been heavier!  Blow you sky high!

B00011F5DK|5.0|We were pleased when we discovered this game.  It works well for every member of our family.  We have children aged 10-18, and they all like this game.  Why?  Well, I'll tell you :-)<br /><br />First of all, the game is easy to learn.  This is a four-player game, and though there are rules for single, two-player, and three-player versions, the four-player game is the best!<br /><br />Each player has an identical set of pieces.  The pieces are all made up of small squares arranged in different configurations that look kind of like tetris pieces.  There are pieces are comprised of one, two, three, four, and five squares.  The goal of the game is to play as many of your pieces on the board as you can while striving to block your opponents from playing all of theirs.  The only two rules are: 1) when you play your first piece one of the squares of that piece must cover your starting corner space; and 2) every other piece you play for the rest of the game must touch only a corner of one of your other pieces that has already been played.  Sound easy?  It is, well, only sort of.  It's pretty easy until you get blocked or another player moves into the space you had your eye on.<br /><br />You'll be happy and perhaps surprised to find that even youg children (kindergarteners or first-graders) can do as well as they do at this game.  They can even beat their parents - much to the children's delight and the parents' chagrin.<br /><br />After you play this game you'll understand why it has won so many awards, including being named a \\"Mensa Select\\" game.<br /><br />The only down side of this game, at least as far as I can see, is that you have to be obsessive about keeping track of all the pieces.  We make sure that each color's set of pieces is complete whenever we are done playing, and we store each set of pieces in their own plastic bag.  You'll have a tough time playing until you are able to obtain a replacement piece.<br /><br />This is a great game for the family.  You can play a game in less than 30 mins, and children often want to play more than once when this game comes off of the shelf.<br /><br />5 stars!often want to play more than once when this game comes off of the shelf.    5 stars!

B001EYGOEM|1.0|Although she may be writing what teen-age girls are wanting to hear, she CAN'T SING! Sure, she may be pretty, but please, her talent is in writing country-style Avril Lavign songs and nothing more. I saw her completely butcher \\"Silent Night\\" during a Christmas song special. Her other live performances only go to prove the point more. Pitchy, off-key and without range don't describe a 'singing' talent to me. Yet she tries to hit notes she can't, making it even harder to listen to. It's too bad other vocalists can't sell records because they don't have THE LOOK. I may not be who she is targetting as an audience, but I have an open mind and will buy good music regardless. This is just not good. Her song writing is too predictable and lacking variety. I don't see her lasting until she can somehow find her voice and simply find a way to win adult fans.

0316017922|4.0|As in \\"The Tipping Point\\" and \\"Blink,\\" Malcolm Gladwell once again helps explain how the world works.  Covering a wide range of examples ranging from rice farming in China and Canadian hockey to airplane crashes and the rise of Jewish law firms in New York, Gladwell promotes the thesis that timing and culture are key ingredients to success and that innate talent is less important than most people think.     As in his previous books, Gladwell writes clearly and continually reinforces his points by returning to points made earlier in the book.    What is interesting is that Gladwell is not afraid to frame some issues in cultural terms that some could consider politically incorrect.  Particularly interesting is the final chapter in which he addresses his own racially mixed multi-cultural background to show how he arrived at the successful position he now enjoys.    As in his other books, Gladwell provides no original research.  Rather, he pulls together information from the research of others to support his thesis.  The book is well written and very readable.  My only complaint is that, while he makes excellent points, he sometimes understates the fact that, in addition to luck of the draw, talent does still matter.

0679745653|5.0|REVIEW: Another landmark in Capote's career. \\"BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S\\" introduced one of the most unforgettable female protagonists in all of literature: Miss Holiday Golightly (nee Lulamae Barnes). She is part country bumpkin, part actress, and all party girl who revels in the nighttime atmosphere of New York; and who is constantly looking for the peace and security and contentment that she only occasionally feels (particularly when she relaxes at Tiffany's). Her search for love and happiness is chronicled by her upstairs neighbor who observes the various lives she touches with her perky and unpredictable behavior. She is an amazing creation. Capote's superb novella is joined here with three other masterpieces of short fiction: the oddly-paced \\"House Of Flowers\\" (about a young Haitian prostitute's happy marriage that is nearly destroyed by her husband's voodoo-practicing grandmother), the wonderfully etched \\"A Diamond Guitar\\" (which incorporates some of the author's best writing: detailing the arrival and subsequent jailbreak of a young Cuban prisoner who breathes life and hope into the lives of his fellow inmates), and the celebrated \\"A Christmas Memory\\" (a moving, biographical account of Truman's elderly cousin whom he lived with until he was ten years old; and which was made into a popular T.V. movie starring Geraldine Page and narrated by Capote himself). \\"BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S\\" is a classic work of art that helped to cement Truman Capote's name as, arguably, the single greatest writer that America has ever produced.ouse Of Flowers\\") and the casual talk about lesbians and homosexuals may give offense to others. Still, the realistic atmosphere of Capote's settings works well against the backdrop of his delightfully musical prose which leaves the reader hungry for more stories. Certainly \\"A Christmas Memory\\" is the most charming and heart-warming piece here, but my personal favorite is \\"A Diamond Guitar\\" which, in my mind, contains some of Capote's best paragraphs. But because of the tough language and the mild sexual references: I would have to give the book a strong, strong CAUTIONARY rating for its content.

B000002KOO|4.0|REVIEW: Mac's first real commercial breakthrough in the U.S. (in England they were already blues superstars) comes courtesy of a smoldering little rocker called \\"Oh Well\\" which is one of singer/songwriter/guitarist Peter Green's best musical pastiches. The accompanying album, \\"THEN PLAY ON\\", is a most powerful foray into a variety of styles that stretch the limits of what could be properly termed \\"the blues\\". Opening with Danny Kirwan's majestic \\"Coming Your Way\\" (which boogies mercilessly and then segues into a repeated riff that echoes The Beatles' \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\") and continuing on with the heartbreaking \\"Closing My Eyes\\", the slide guitar rave-up \\"Show-Biz Blues\\", and such highlights as the hilarious masturbation manifesto \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\", the epic Mick Fleetwood/John McVie instrumentals \\"Searching For Madge/Fighting For Madge\\", Kirwan's beautiful \\"Like Crying\\", and Green's swirling lament \\"Before The Beginning\\" which closes the album perfectly: the expansion of the group's basic sound pays off big time. The original American LP was actually tighter since it omitted a couple of more extraneous tracks (the lush instrumental \\"My Dream\\" and the wan pop of \\"When You Say\\" which has aged really, really badly; and which is the main reason why I give this CD version only four stars). The interplay between Fleetwood, McVie, Green, Kirwan, guitarist Jeremy Spencer, and (occasionally, uncredited) keyboardist Christine Perfect (soon to be McVie) is nothing short of awesome. But because the record company messed with the original track lineup (\\"My Dream\\" and \\"When You Say\\" should have been tacked on at the end as bonus selections): the CD comes off a bit spotty.    HIGHEST BILLBOARD ALBUM CHART POSITION: Number 109    HIT SINGLES: \\"Oh Well (Part 1)\\" (BILLBOARD: Number 55)Fleetwood Mac fan. There is very little to offend here other than the risque (and very funny) \\"Rattlesanke Shake\\", a couple of minor swear words on \\"Show-Biz Blues\\", and the cool looking album jacket. Some may also balk at the self-depreciating lyrics to \\"Oh Well\\", and the desperate pall of sadness that haunts Peter Green's songwriting (a foreshadowing of his eventual LSD-fueled emotional breakdown and prolonged stay in a psychiatric hospital). But because of the adult content: the record should earn a mild CAUTIONARY rating.      HIGHEST BILLBOARD ALBUM CHART POSITION: Number 109    HIT SINGLES: \\"Oh Well (Part 1)\\" (BILLBOARD: Number 55)

B001KVZ6FC|5.0|In \\"Gran Torino,\\" it at first appears that Clint Eastwood has left his \\"Dirty Harry\\" days behind and has turned into a grumpy old man. His character, Walt Kowalski, recently lost his wife and is adjusting to life on his own. That life appears to be pretty meaningless. Walt basically putters around the house all day and barks at anyone who attempts to show him a bit of kindness. His relationship with his two grown sons is incredibly strained, and the only company he can tolerate is that of his dog. Walt is a Korean War veteran and harbors a great deal of anger and resentment. He lives in a neighborhood that has deteriorated over the years, and he is none too pleased that an Asian family has moved into the house next door. At first Walt goes out of his way to be rude to the Hmong family, but he eventually warms up to Sue (Ahney Her) and eventually takes her brother, Thao (Bee Vang), under his wing (but only after the kid proves that he really is sorry about trying to steal Walt's prized Gran Torino). Thao's being pressured to join his cousin's gang, and when violence literally spills onto Walt's front lawn, he discovers that he can't turn a blind eye to the dangers facing his unlikely new friends.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie. (When was the last time Eastwood delivered anything less?) \\"Gran Torino\\" boasts an outstanding script, a talented cast, and of course Eastwood himself, whose performance is Oscar-worthy. See this one in the theatre.
0060935464|5.0|I loved this coming-of-age story set in Maycomb, Alabama that takes place during a two-year period in the 1930s. The narrator and main character, Jean Louis \\"Scout\\" Finch, enters first grade and her brother Jeremy \\"Jem\\" fourth, at its outset. Their father, widower and attorney-at-law Atticus Finch, is assigned to defend a black man accused of raping a white teenager who comes from a poor, motherless, family \\"led\\" by an abusive, neglectful, racist father. Kids can be cruel, and as the Finch children soon learn, their classmates, oftentimes following their parents' lead, tease them mercilessly about their father's willingness to take on the case. An assortment of well-developed characters, both friends and foes of the Finches, round out the cast, including their young friend Charles \\"Dill\\" Thomas (the relative of a neighbor) and the secret but significant younger son of a neighbor, Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley, who is said to have stabbed one of his parents with a knife one day (a scenario reenacted repeatedly by the three children). Although the dialogue includes (perhaps a dozen instances of the) use of the \\"n\\" word, it's the means to an end. The overlying theme of To Kill a Mockingbird is that no matter what the consequences, racism must not be tolerated. Perfectly plotted and filled with well-developed characters every one, this meaningful-messaged story is one of my all-time favorite classics. Also good: In Cold Blood by Truman Capote, Great Expectations by Charles Dickens, and The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|The game is deceptively simple.  Quick setup, quick gameplay, and straightforward rules.  Yet where it really shines, is its addictiveness.  It can be played over and over again.  Because the gameboard is randomly generated, it's really a different game each time.  Simple rules make it easy for the whole family to enjoy.  Rather than spending 3/4 of the time consulting the rulebook, we spent it playing.  One of the most fun games I have come across in years.

0618871713|4.0|Bechdel's simple prose and accompanying graphics tell the story of a girl growing up in an unhappy household with a closeted father. Focusing on her dad, who dies suddenly not long after Bechdel leaves for college, she tries to make sense of who he was and the reasons for his death. Appropriately, given that her father was an English teacher and loved the written word, Bechdel often relies on literary analogies. Despite a sometimes difficult relationship, one of her father's great loves was passed on to Bechdel, at least in some form. Bechdel paints a difficult home life without passing judgement. In simple words and graphics, she effectively relays a very personal and engaging story. I loved her story-telling, and the graphics were an exceptional, quintessential addition to the reading. A few words expand greatly in meaning through her pictures. Highly recommended--I would suggest the hard copy as it is only a few dollars more and I was disappointed once I finished and my soft copy covers were curled back completely. A lovely book worth holding on to.
032147404X|3.0|I bought this book based on reviews here.  I had used 35mm years before and was reentering photography as a \\"serious\\" hobby after some years away and some years of point and shoot cameras.  The book is okay and certainly not a waste of money.  The info contained could be found in just about any decent book on photography.  There was nothing here that I found extraordinary or wonderful.  His approach.... \\"I'm right with you\\"... is okay as well, but didn't add anything for me.  He is pretty devoted to Canon and Nikon equipment as well as Photoshop.  This book may appeal to you a bit more if those are your cup of tea, but essentially it shouldn't matter a great deal.... although at times I kind of felt like I was reading ads for his favorite products.  I would advise looking around for a book with more info.... possibly one with more info on your specific camera. (I found a book with: as much basic info on photos and written specifically for the functions of my camera by searching the camera name and \\"field guide\\" here on Amazon.)  All-in-all this book isn't a bad thing, but I suspect something better awaits you!

1400067936|5.0|you won't want to put this book down.  Without question \\"fooled by randomness\\" is my favorite investment book.  Nasim's insights are too many to recount in my review, but mark my word one reading is not enough.  You will find yourself going back to this book on more occasions than one.  Far better to see the world through nasim eyes than stumble randomly through the investment world mosaic of head i win/tails i win foolishness.  He clearly surmises that violent, hidden events occur far more often than today's investment models predict.  No where is this more evident than today's debacle of sub prime loans gone bad and how this fed the greatest economic calamity since the great depression.  The basic premise there was housing never depreciates at the levels we just witnessed or at least that's what the model said.  Nasim challenges us to respect the unknown/unknowns.....

B00001U0E1|5.0|To my mind, what separates an excellent film from a good film is the bonus of being able to view it over and over again without it becoming stale. You continue to be entertained and find yourself discovering elements of the plot and aspects of the characters that you missed on previous viewings. Shakespeare in Love, with its clever plot and rich writing, meets that criterion. You have to keep your eyes and ears open to catch all the fun. Even background players in the street scenes shout out inside jokes, like lines from Shakespeare's plays. Anyone who enjoys Shakespeare will love this film.    Production values are excellent, scenery and costumes lush, sound and score fine. The cast is more than up to the task of creating Elizabethan England. You'll find Gwyneth Paltrow a wonder. What a delight to find a young American actress, aside from Meryl Streep,  who can handle an English accent convincingly.     I rarely buy films on DVD, but I had to own this one.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|MAMMA MIA is the HAPPIEST movie out there... in a world that much needs it!     It enlivens the soul through both laughter and joy. The cast was superb as was the photography. The producer(s) did a great job switching back and forth between scenes cut at Pinewood Studios in London and  ones done in Greece  The Director's commentary on the making of the film was as fantastic as the movie itself...       It is a must for movie lovers!

0061537934|4.0|A slightly over the top melodrama is redeemed by the clever idea of having the story be told by the family dog. Dennis is a professional race car driver who soon after adopting a mutt, meets his future wife, marries her, and has a child. But domestic bliss is shattered by his wife being diagnosed with a terminal illness, and the story spirals tragically from there. The dog, Enzo, is winning and sweet, and will certainly make you look at your own four legged friend a bit differently. Yet with all the misery inflicted upon his master, it's a wonder he didn't just cut his losses and look for Marley's owner to live out the rest of his life. If you can get past the near soap opera level drama, you'll find a sweet story at it's heart.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|I have enjoyed this DVD a lot.  I have watched this movie so much on the movie channel that I decided to purchase it so I could watch it whenever I wanted instead of waiting for it to come on the movie channels.  I never seem to get tired of seeing it.
B001PPLIEQ|4.0|This is one of those movies you're not sure what to think of until some time passes from your first viewing. I believe the main reason that this series has been going for so long is that, when the producers have made a mistake on one of their films, they will show an open mind, come back the next time around and fix it. EX.: the sillier space sagas YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and MOONRAKER were followed respectively by ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, films in which Bond was brought back to earth; the outlandish DIE ANOTHER DIE was followed by the solid CASINO ROYALE and so forth. With this in mind, my suggestions for fixing the goofs on QUANTUM OF SOLACE are as follows:  1) Hire a real, renowned great singer, not one teens will dig (as far as I know, Shirley Bassey is still alive and these kids can't hold a candle to her).   2) Never again use the Bourne editing process, nobody likes it, period. You can't appreciate a great stunt when it cuts too fast to a next one which you don't end up appreciating either. QOS' editing all but itself sank it.   3) The gun barrel scene goes at the beginning, never again at the end. What the heck was the point in doing so ?   4) Go to any exotic countries you may like but use their most beautiful locales, not their ugliest. It's nice to find locations with \\"flavor\\", not so good when they don't \\"taste\\" so good.   5) If you want the audience to hate the villain, don't just imply he killed a beloved characters as in the case of Mathis and Agent Fields. Show it on screen so we can detest him properly and thus enjoy his doom.   6) When Bond kills the main villain show it. Don't just have him discuss it with his boss.   7) As bad as things might be for Bond on the movie. Give him a few scenes in which he might actually be happy. One of his main characteristics is his enjoyment of the good things in life (drink, food, girls and so on).  8) A follow up to 7: Bond must never say goodbye to the movie's main woman character ina car, in the dessert shaking hands or whatever. A body of water and heavy kissing have always been the norm (and worked out great as far as I can remember).   9) Take under consideration: hotels in the dessert are not flammable per se.   10) Bring back Moneypenny and Q. Their scenes always brought a smile to my face. Samantha Bond is more than adequate as the first but good luck finding someone to replace the beloved Desmond Llewlyn (but you have to do it anyway !).   11) Make sure the villain's plot is something more evil and dangerous to world wide peace than simply leaving about a dozen people with funny looking hats, waterless.  12) Also remember, there are great film-makers, auteurs and directors who know how to make great Bond movies. Which have been the best of the recent ones ? : GOLDENYE and CASINO ROYALE. What do both of them have in common ?. Need I go on ? I'm sure you can afford the guy.   By the way, QOS is OK. Had a sane editor cut it it would be above average for Bond, as it was it turned out below the median line. I guess you can say it is not as good as the sum of its parts and as such a wasted opportunity.

B001DUJNGS|4.0|I'll be honest, when I first heard the single off this album, my first thought was WTF. It was a very stark contrast to the music I heard previoulsy from enigma. The guys voice was very jarring to me, and I didn't really like it.<br /><br />I had bought it for a gift and ended up ripping it and gave it a few more listens. The single started to grow on me and the rest of the music was more in line to what enigma had done before. The single Seven Lives started to grow on me and I actually really like it now. It's defintely very different but has some connections to how he usually sounds.<br /><br />I wouldn't have minded hearing a version with a girl singing. Not every song is a gem, but none of the songs are bad, and all offer something unique. I guess it's good he tried something different. It really was jarring at first to expect one thing and get another. The beatbox thing sounded cheesy at first, but it kinda grew on me and flowed with the song.<br /><br />Overall, keep in mind that the main single is the most different thing on the album. The other songs are pretty in line with how Enigma usually sounds. With that being said I can see the mixed reviews, but if you really go in with an open mind, you'll be surprised.

This movie is a peace of art in vampiric proportions.<br /><br />It had been made with elegance and a gentle touch. Even tough there is quite some blood especially when Lestat gets hungry it also looks tempting and subtle.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.

B001KVZ6FC|4.0|Clint Eastwood's \\"Gran Torino\\", named for the 1972 Ford his character helped construct during his days as an auto assembler that also has a starring role in the movie, is another in the line of films Eastwood has produced, directed and starred in that address people whose lives lack fulfillment and meaning until they make significant changes and sacrifices. The movie reminded me most of 2002's \\"About Schmidt\\", Jack Nicholson's moving and contemporary study of a man whose life lacks meaning until he does somethings completely new and rewarding that redefines his moribund existence.<br /><br />While it is indeed an intense character study, the manifest content of \\"Gran Torino\\" is more akin to \\"Grand Canyon\\", where the 21st century urban realities of racism, gangs, lowlifes and interrace relationships creates a kettle of stew we've seen on celluloid many times before. What separates this from others of its ilk is Eastwood's splendid acting as Walt Kowalski, an old world retiree living among immigrants in what is clearly an old Detroit neighborhood -- maybe Hamtramck, one of Detroit's most rundown areas that once was home to thousands of Polish immigrants.<br /><br />Kowalksi, like Schmidt, begins his trek to salvation in retirment by losing his wife. For Schmidt, this opened new possibilities. For Kowalski, it seemed to extinguish possibilities, driving him further into a self-imposed existence where little more than beer, his dog, his little slice of yard and home, and his beloved car mean anything. A man that never really got on with his children, grandchildren, his church or anyone in his neighborhood, Kowalski becomes almost completely isolated from this world and exhibits ongoing anger and resentment toward it.<br /><br />His re-engagement in his community comes through a relationship with neighbors, a group of Hmong immigrants and first generation Americans that arrived via the Vietnam war, and his engagement in their personal lives and problems. It is from this perspective the Kowalski eventually find fulfillment and salavation for his own life of estrangement.<br /><br />I found personal parallels in Kowalski's characterization to my own father, a World War II veteran who came home and rarely discussed the war with me. While Kowalski's memories of Korea are horrifying, my dad, too, found the war too difficult to talk about. And, while Kowalski at first rejected the overtures of his priest to help him recover from both his wife's death and his life of self-imposed torture, my dad also rejected God and faith until late in life, when he told my mother there might be something to it. Kowalski found his religious conversion differently, as you'll see when you watch this film.<br /><br />\\"Gran Torino\\" demonstrates the benchmark characteristics people love in Eastwood's contemporary films: multidimensional characters you care about, stepped storylines that move seamlessly from one objective to the next, and all the human emotions people go to the movies to see, hear and feel -- laughter, drama, humor, heartbreak and tragedy. It is often so much like real life it is easy to suspend disbelief for 125 minutes during \\"Gran Torino\\". I am not a sentimental person but I nearly cried at the apothosis of this film, during the critical scene where Eastwood reaches salvation. I haven't cried during a movie since seeing \\"Old Yeller\\" as a boy. This was a touching, marvelously wrought conclusion to a story of one man's mission to find meaning and purpose in a life devoid of both.<br /><br />I'm sure this film will recieve Oscar and other award considerations. I haven't been a great fan of Eastwood's late films such as \\"Unforgiven\\", \\"Million Dollar Baby\\", \\"Mystic River\\" and \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\", all of which either won Oscars or were nominated for them. To me, critics saw more in these films than I saw and they were uniformly overrated. I don't question they are all fine films, but the greatest of their years? Not to me. Since 2009 just started, it's hard to imagaine where \\"Gran Torino\\" will stack up among this year's films but certainly, I think, it is at least as good as those I've mentioned that came before it, putting it in apparently excellent company.ill stack up among this year's films but certainly, I think, it is at least as good as those I've mentioned that came before it, putting it in apparently excellent company.
B00009P1O5|4.0|This is the album that bridges the quiet country and blustery patriotism of \\"Hawks and Doves\\" and the electronica of \\"Trans\\" and is one of the 4 albums Neil released that David Geffen blamed for the downfall of his record company. Neil and his band rock hard and loud all the way through with lyrics that are still relevant over 20 years after its release. Although some of the songs aren't his strongest, \\"Southern Pacific\\" is a classic with its take on forced retirement, while \\"Motor City\\" deals with Detroit's woes and \\"T-Bone\\" says more about economic trouble with 2 lyric repeated over 8 minutes of guitar distorted fury. \\"Got mashed potatoes, Ain't got no T-Bone.\\" That pretty much says it all.

B000002HEM|5.0|MTV Unplugged was pretty much 10,000 Maniacs' last hurrah, and they made every second count.  Even when the host introduces Natalie and the Maniacs, you could feel the excitement seeping through the CD (or tape) and that feeling lingers throughout.<br /><br />I admit that I'm a casual Maniacs (and Merchant) fan, but I did know enough about them to grasp that their music was never for the soft-hearted or casual, just flipping-through-the-dial listener.  They had a way of putting across some serious messages with a sound that appealed to a wide range of listeners.  The sad thing is the Maniacs never really did get a decent amount of airplay on corporate American radio, but, nonetheless, they had, and continue to have, their dedicated (and casually dedicated) base.<br /><br />As someone else pointed out a few years ago, \\"Because the Night\\" got very heavy radio airplay in the early-90's and the cover was the pop audience's introduction to the Maniacs and, specifically, the vocal genius of Merchant.  Merchant's cover actually managed to surpass the original by The Patti Smith Group almost 20 years earlier (or, if you want to disagree with that, the cover was definitely on a par with the original).<br /><br />In any case, I enjoyed the MTV Unplugged series as an opportunity to see if pop stars could really sing - sans the recording studio tricks.  To me, a person can sing if their voice is *at least* 98% loud and clear when the only instruments for accompaniment are a piano and/or a regular guitar.  Listening to this volume of Unplugged is an absolute treasure because Merchant's voice is so clear and passionate.  There is no mistaken this woman is a fine singer in every sense of the word.<br /><br />Too bad today's \\"American Idol\\" rejects and wanna-bes (who are nothing more than glorified Karaoke singers force-fed down the general public's throats) can't do the Unplugged thing.  \\"Ironic\\" how MTV did less and less \\"Unplugged\\" sessions as time went on as record companies were foisting their creations on the world.  Lots of these so-called \\"singers\\" today couldn't carry the proverbial tune in a bucket, yet they still manage to sell millions of records (when can we see Miley Cyrus or the \\"legendary\\" Britney Spears do an Unplugged session?  Hell, I'd like to see if Madonna has what it takes!)<br /><br />When I think of the aforementioned and all the CDs they've been able to sell largely with the help of the record company p.r. department (minus Madonna), it kind of makes you steamed that 10,000 Maniacs as a group and Natalie Merchant as a solo artist just weren't given the chance they should have been given to appeal to any even bigger audience, but at least we have gems such as this to harken back to.  - Donna Di Giacomohe world.

When I think of the aforementioned and all the CDs they've been able to sell largely with the help of the record company p.r. department (minus Madonna), it kind of makes you steamed that 10,000 Maniacs as a group and Natalie Merchant as a solo artist just weren't given the chance they should have been given to appeal to any even bigger audience, but at least we have gems such as this to harken back to.  - Donna Di Giacomo

B000002HHB|5.0|I'm sure there are plenty of folks out there who have heard so much hype about an album, made every effort to get it, just was never able to, and eventually got it so many years down the road.  If not, then I'm uniquely alone in the endeavor of obtaining Natalie Merchant's \\"Tigerlilly,\\" released all those years ago in 1995, quite recently.<br /><br />I remember the hype surrounding her departure from 10,000 Maniacs in the '90's (her announcement coming years before the fact) and the intense speculation of whether or not she would produce a quality solo album.  Not only did she prove the critics wrong (again), but she created such an amazing album that the sound remains far from dated almost 15 years after its release and it's one of those rare treasures that I can listen to from beginning to end.<br /><br />The album starts off with a great, mellow tune, \\"San Andreas Fault,\\" which I can't get enough of.  Also included are the radio-friendly \\"Wonder\\" and \\"Carnival\\" (which both received okay radio airplay - in my view, not as much as they should have considering the caliber of Merchant's talent).<br /><br />Though I can listen to the album in its entirety, I will admit I prefer to skip over \\"Beloved Wife.\\"  While a beautiful song, it's extremely depressing and Merchant's increasingly sad tone as the song goes on doesn't help matters any.  That sad feeling lingers a while after the song's ended.  On a brighter note, \\"Seven Years\\" was a great finale to this classic album.<br /><br />If there ever was an essential album, \\"Tigerlilly\\" is definitely it!  - Donna Di Giacomo
B001F3DY9A|3.0|The CD itself is easy to listen too.  Nicely manufactured studio voice.  But live? She is terrible live, sounds like a cat on a fence.  Its amazing what they can to a voice on the studio..
0307269191|5.0|I am not a runner, but truly enjoy this book. This book is not necessarily about running, but about running one's life. It is not merely about running from the starting point to the finish line, but about the life-long pursuit to unify one's mind, body, and soul, while using running as a vehicle. Whatever one' vehicle is -- running, tennis, golf, quilting -- Murakami's superb book is enlightening.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|While there are weird flaws in this film, it is still the best comic book adaptation to date. There is all the action and great dialogue you could want... Joker in particular has some stellar speaches (unstoppable force meets immovable object), plus outstanding action (car chases, and thuggery) If you are a just fan of big cinematic shots or been to Chicago it is worth the purchase. Lots of great shots of lower wacker, lasalle and the daley bldg. Heath Ledger's last film completed is enough reason to buy this, but hey, if your a skeptic, the free digital copy will convince you. Buy it for someowne else, enjoy the digi copy. Even the skeptics like this one.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|The film works at two levels. 1) It is a great throw back to classic Film Noir done to the back drop of high school. Our hero investigates a murder and unravels a larger plot. Classic archetypes and great story. 2) anyone can enjoy it, not just the film geeks.
B00168OINK|5.0|Funny movie, and it looks awesome on Blu-Ray.  It's worthy of making it your disc to show off your Hi Def system.
B001DVBZ4K|5.0|Bought 2 of these for grandkids this Christmas. The first surprise is that the stuffed Horton that came with the DVD was adorable! Little, but so cute and the girls got such a kick out of them. Then they just told me how much fun the DVD was! They laughed all the way through it. Both of them loved it. Plus I got them with one day shipping, so they came in plenty of time for Christmas.
0439023483|5.0|I started reading this around 7:00 PM last night and I couldn't put it down after the second chapter. This hasn't happened since last July (when I was addicted to The Good Earth by Pearl Buck). I love to read, but I have a craplod of schoolwork so if I can't get into a book by the second chapter, I usually just toss it. I really do look for the \\"can't-put-it-down\\" books, because who doesn't love that \\"this book is so awesome I can't stop!\\" feeling, but those books are hard to find for me. I am glad to say that this book was definitely a \\"can't-put-it-down.\\" I was supposed to be studying for midterms but The Hunger Games so engrossed me that I just couldn't let it go. I was up until 5:00 AM, and it took me on a thrill ride. I laughed, cried, and found my heart pounding at the all scary parts.<br /><br />I didn't get any of the derivate references Stephen King made (I'm a HS senior...soon to be second semester senior yay! and I've never watched those movies before in my lifetime) so all the plot details were pretty new to me.<br /><br />However, for those who started the book but haven't gotten into it, I was sort of in the same situation. I read the first chapter and laid it down for a week before I started it up again. My initial impression was that the writing was kind of abrupt and Katniss (oh, yeah, I was also like: Katniss? Really? but it grew on me) was kind of angsty, but like someone mentioned Ms. Collins manages to make Katniss and the style really likeable. I also loved the love interest thing.  Katniss' uncertain obliviousness was definitely believable (unlike, well, Twilight) and was kind of waves-of-giddiness-inducing for me as a girl.<br /><br />Anyway, Ms. Collins' storytelling is just amazing. The adventure aspects of this book just brought it to such a great place. She really makes your heart pound. I expected it to be kind of preachy but it really was not, although as I read on I wondered how she was going to resolve the society they live in and depose the Capitol, considering there weren't that many pages left. And then I realized it was a trilogy so it's all good, although the ending kind of left me clawing at the door. I really wanted to know what happened.<br /><br />My sister and I read the library version. We are probably going to go buy the hardcopy because it was so awesome.<br /><br />Ms. Collins, thank you for writing this book and I hope anyone who reads these reviews will pick up the book as well, because it really was a blast.idering there weren't that many pages left.

1932100660|5.0|I originally checked this book out of my local library, but have since come back to purchase it from Amazon. I know I'll reread it and look back to it for many years. The writing is engaging and very readable, and the information is astounding. I've read plenty of diet and nutrition books before, but I've never understood so well and felt so convinced about the power of a plant-based diet. Just for the record, I'm a 51 year old woman. I'm carrying around too much weight around my middle and starting to have really frequent and uncomfortable hot flashes. After only 3 days following the recommendations in this book, the hot flashes have disappeared. Now maybe you're skeptical and think \\"that's ridiculous - she's probably just a nutcase.\\" I understand - I'm a skeptic too. So go to the library and read this book. I don't give out 5 stars on a book just because it held my interest or was \\"pretty good.\\" This book is incredible.

0156027321|5.0|A tiger slept under the tarp at the far side of the lifeboat, and the boy wanted to get under the tarp with the tiger because the sun came down on the bright, glittering sea.<br /><br />The lifeboat floated with the debris of the sunken steamer, shattered wooden doors, life preservers that had failed to preserve any life, wads of paper, and cloth, and other things that managed to float in the roiling blue water. If the boy looked right down into the sea, it was green. He didn't see the tiger, but knew it must still be in the boat because it had been there last night. When the tiger became hungry, the boy knew the tiger would eat him.<br /><br />The boy plunged into the water. He slipped below the surface, and saw the boat hull as a dark shape between him and the surface of the water. He paddled to the life preserver, drug that back to the boat, and hung it from one of the oar hooks. He swam back to the other pieces of junk -- lying in various orbits from the boat -- and when he went out there, he thought the boat might get away from him, and leave him stranded, clinging to a stray box, his legs kicking and frothing in the fathoms of transparent lime colored water. The boat never left, though. And finally he had all of the junk trailing from the end of the boat. He had found a trunk and tied the end of the rope to a handle, and then he climbed into the boat and was relieved to be in the boat, where it was dry and hot.<br /><br />The tiger had come out from under the tarp. When it saw him, it breathed its breath; an odor like meat left on the counter. It was a ratty, old tiger; the sleekness of the fur had gone out and left the hair in knots, and pills of dirt on the skin. The tiger disappeared under the tarp.<br /><br />The boy pulled the trunk up into the boat. The boat rocked, and the tiger made an uncomfortable noise and then the trunk came over the edge and into the boat. The boy couldn't open the trunk. He worked at opening the trunk for hours and then finally as it became dusk, he lay down on the side of the boat and slept. At night, the tiger moved around the boat. The boy woke once to see the tiger silhouetted against the light of the moon. The boy woke in the morning, cold, and cramped from sleeping on the boards all night. There was dew on the wood, and he licked the planks clean of moisture. His lips had started to crack. He didn't like sleeping outside because the air settled on his face and made him feel odd. He felt odd, waking up and he looked for the tiger. It must be curled under the tarp.<br /><br />The boy resumed his work on the locked trunk. He worried the lock with a nail from the boat, turning it, and finally, he didn't even know how long it took, it clicked. He turned it, and it clicked. He turned it and it clicked and then finally when the sun was high above the boat, and there was nothing in the sky except for a faint speck of something white flying near the horizon.<br /><br />He opened the trunk. The trunk contained a gun, a case of bullets, a bottle of gun oil, an oily cloth, and assorted gun cleaning brushes. The boy took the gun out of the case. It was a light, steel thing warm in the tropical air with the maker's glyph forged into the bottom of the handle and a number along one side. The barrel was octagonal shaped. The boy put the bullet into the casing. He thought he should kill the tiger. He should just shoot the tiger, and then he would be safe. He loaded the gun and the noise it made, the metallic rattle, clattered over the shiny blue waves.<br /><br />He pulled the tarp away from the tiger. The tiger twitched its whiskers at him, and lifted its mouth. The gums around the tiger's mouth were black and coated with white froth. The tiger didn't make a noise, but opened its mouth to show the dry tongue and let out the stench of its throat.<br /><br />The thought of the tiger eating the boy became terrible to the boy. Just the thought of those jagged, nicked teeth piercing his skin caused the boyto constrict. He fired a bullet. The bullet passed into the tiger. The bullet passed through the tiger and then passed through the boat and into the sea, leaving behind a dead tiger, and a jagged and cracked board.<br /><br />The boy jumped down and pressed the tiger up against the side of the hole. This was enough that it stopped the water from rushing into the boat; but blood and seawater filled the bottom of the hull in a trickle. The boy put the life preserver around the middle of his body. Gradually water rushed into the boat until finally the boat and tiger, and the gun sank and then the boat drifted away in the greenish water and was gone. The boy was thirsty and now wouldn't be able to lick the boat clean of dew. The boy drifted in the current among the debris of the sunken ocean liner. When night fell, he didn't know what to do. He waited. He was a dot on the vast, rolling expanse of waves.e tiger.

B0017ANAZO|5.0|This film is all about women.  Played by some of the finest actresses today we have a group of friends who stick together in good and bad: married woman with one child living in posh suburb in New York, woman with five children living in Queens, lesbian woman in search of long term companion, divorced career woman not so ready  to give herself to a new man, let alone a new family - and then their is a seductress woman whose job is to steal other women's men (or women) for that matter.  Amazing script that tells a story about the midlife crisis of a mid-age woman who with a little help of her girlfriends manages to find her own strength and re-define herself as she was almost 15 years ago.  This movie has no male characters, but will keep you on your toes.  Better yet, it is much better than any of the \\"Sex in the City\\" episodes (sorry I did not see that movie yet).  The fashion, jewelry, hairstyles and makeup are absolutely amazing.  It almost feels like perpetual \\"Vanity Fair\\" from start to finish.  The best line for me ever is when Annette Benning says to a child who cries in a department story \\"Honey, no one hates Saks Fith Avenue\\".  And it does not take a SFA regular to get that line!  I strongly recommend this movie for anyone - I am sure that even men will like it.  In these hard times when jobs are getting lost, divorce is everywhere and friends disappear at the slightest sign of trouble this movie will give you some hope.  And it will make you laugh.
B0007TKNCY|5.0|I love this movie, I remember watching it on our first black and white TV, yes I'm older, but my 21 year old gradson was over, when I had it on, and he even got some laughs out of it. It's one I'll watch many time, great combo of actors, and darling story for the times. I believe this was one of Katharine Hepbun's first leading roles.
B001675YQ6|4.0|Brittany Murphy gives a wonderful performance in this little romantic comedy film.  Set in London, most actors (except for Murphy's character Jacks) are British.  Jacks works in fashion industry that explains her fashionable outfits and \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" movie obsession.  She is in a relationship with a guy she does not love and meddles with all of her friends' love lives.  Every time she meddles she gets is wrong.  Her roomate is openly guy so we have a new twist on the modern day relationships in a big city (like London).<br /><br />I just cannot get it out of my head that this is just a different take on Jane Austen's \\"Emma\\".  It is almost confirmed when at the end of the movie Gwyneth Paltrow shows up for a brief scene.  Lots os fun, great performance by Murphy, fantastic fashion, real European cinema feel to it.  This comedy will entertain you for a time beeing, but will not leave a lasting impression.
0316143472|5.0|This title caught my eye in line at a bookstore, heavy laden with other people's Christmas gifts. While I juggled the other titles in my hand, I opened this book and started reading chapter two, \\"The Understudy\\". I was hooked, and even laughed aloud in the long line, to the annoyance of the other customers. Had to buy it as a gift to myself, and read the book in one sitting later that week. I'm new to David Sedaris, but I immediately recognized a kindred spirit with his insane attention to details in the past. I don't care if the stories are embellished, I devoured every one and loved the little ray of light, wit, and hope that shines through in so many of the stories. A great storyteller with gallows humor and a lot of heart. Life is hard, we have to laugh more than cry. Bravo!

1593081308|5.0|Jane Austen is my favorite author when it comes to the classics. Her writing is timeless. It's delicate, romantic & sometimes humorous. All these years later you can still read her work and enjoy it.<br /><br />I liked Anne, I think she was just too young and naive when she broke off her engagement to Wentworth and in seeing him again all those years later, she was more mature and knew what she wanted for herself. I like Wentworth, he's now my second favorite Austen hero, the man can write a wonderful love letter. This was a great novel, the storyline was really good.<br /><br />Wentworths love letter is divine!<br />'I can listen no longer in silence. I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach. You pierce my soul. I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever. I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own, than when you almost broke it eight years and a half ago'

That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your family owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought only of you.'

B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I just got Enya's latest cd. I love it. My 15 year old son and I listened to it repeatedly on a long trip to the doctor.  I read a review which someone else made, and the comment was expressed that Enya needs to get some new instruments! That is like telling Kenny G that he needs to throw away his saxaphone for another instrument!!! Enya is a uniquely different musician, and her background music speaks ENYA!!! The songs are beautiful, some are fun. My son and I both loved this album!

0785819118|5.0|The Origin of Species: By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life<br /><br />I read this incredible, historic book eight years after I retired from a career in academia, and the year after a visit to the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands. I suppose it took a visit to the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands to inspire me to finally get Darwin's gem and read it cover to cover. This turned out to be a wonderful investment of my time.<br /><br />A big regret is that I did not read this groundbreaking book early in my career. If I had done so, I could have benefited from Darwin's insights and his remarkable example as a scientist. I was unfamiliar with the vast scope of research he conducted himself, his scores of connections to other scientists before the era of modern communications, and his uniquely global perspective.<br /><br />I do not claim to understand everything I read in this superb, mind-stretching book. But it was worth the effort--in spades! Origin of the Species is a must-read for everyone with a natural curiosity about life around us.<br /><br />  --Earl B. Russell
B001E5FYS8|4.0|What an amazing feat!  Petit is a god - to be able to \\"dance\\" on a wire for 45 minutes while 1,350 feet in the air.  That's incomprehensible to those of us with better than average balance and athleticism.  I loved watching this film but felt afterwards that an important question had not been asked: How does Petit do it?  Does the wire seem wider and more stable to him than it would to a mortal?  How does he think about balancing himself?  The focus of this film is more on the caper, which was fascinating, than on the aesthetic sensibility of a genius.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|If you look at the regular DVD & the Special Edition DVD of the The Dark Knight, it would be wise & worth it to spend a little more money to get the Special Edition version. It's loaded with extras & a digital copy, which proves to be the better copy of this movie.

Bot the CD and one song is better than the next until you replay the CD and then you know each and every song is better than the one before... a \\"do loop\\" of constant gratification. Nutini wrote all the songs when he was younger than 17(?) and yet demonstrates a relationship knowledge of much greater life experiences. Fantastic instruments and rock/soul sound...wonderful variety in songs...vocal quality of extreme talent. Bought our initial CD and then purchased 4 as gifts.  We would see him in concert if there was a guaranteed way to do so. This is a MUST HAVE.

1439130833|5.0|The Secret, and this daily reminder book are both serving as an incredible catalyst for the upward movement of consciousness in the world.  There was a lot of speak on \\"the materialistic nature of The Secret\\", etc.  However, the general message has not been lost which is that you CAN create the life that you want.  My interpretation is that \\"The Secret\\" is bringing hope to those who previously felt disempowered.<br /><br />If you have enough food, water, clothing, transportation, work, money, etc, then it is easy to take life for granted.  There are far too many people out there in the world who either don't have what they need, or do not think that they deserve what they need.  This is why I feel that \\"The Secret\\" is a powerful positive message, because people who previously did not think that they deserved, were worth, or could do what they wanted in life-now feel as if they have a chance.<br /><br />If you want to get charged up and feel empowered, then read these great books :)<br /><br />Then, you can continue your journey with \\"Reality Creation 101\\".
B001GCUNVW|5.0|This is a remarkable movie. Never has a more ridiculous way to earn a living been turned into a story with so much dignity.<br />And I watched it with such wrong expectations. Somebody said or wrote somewhere, that it is about an aging wrestler who fights his way back to shape, a basic re-surrection story, told only a few hundred times before.<br /><br />No, it isn't. It is as unpathetic as it can get without being unreal. Randy knows that he has lost and he does not whine. He has ruined his relationship with his daughter beyond repair. His hopes for more than friendly banter with a stripper are rebuffed. (Marisa Tomey gives us a highly credible stripper. After Randy comes bloody from a fight, she giggles and calls him the sacrificial ram, urges him to watch Gibson's Passion of Christ movie.) His future is non-existent. His body is at an end point. Randy the Ram takes the honorable route.<br /><br />A major asset in the film are the 'real' wrestlers, the men who make up the population of the movie, together with the audience. One must assume that the spectators are also real. The wrestlers are so incredibly normal, like your neighbors next door, despite all their fancy dresses and their weird paraphernalia, while the spectators are goof balls. (I used to be exposed to 'wrestling' on the TV screens of a health club some time ago. I never figured out why anyone would want to watch that stuff.)<br /><br />My normal daily paper, the South China Morning Post, wrote the fabulous head line: Rourke takes the Mickey out of Penn. Meaning of course that Rourke deserves the Oscar over Sean Penn in Milk.<br />Let me say, I am neutral on that question. Both guys deserve it easily.<br />(P.S. in the meantime the Oscar nominations are out and they are indeed both running for Best Actor. All considered I would favor Penn, as he impersonated somebody else, brillantly, while Rourke seems to be doing an alter ego.)<br /><br />And don't forget the great sound track, with an original song by the Boss and great rock and roll from Guns and Roses and others.uns and Roses and others.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|I always look forward to the next Woody Allen movie.<br /><br />Many of his films are great.  Others are very good, and a few are just okay.  Personally, I don't think he's ever made a \\"turkey,\\" though the few films in which he's written a part for another actor and had him deliver his lines in that unique \\"Woody Allen rhythm\\" (e.g. CELEBRITY, ANYTHING ELSE) don't really work that well.<br /><br />His latest, VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA, is certainly Allen's best film since MATCH POINT (2005).  The picture might best be described as \\"a seductive romantic comedy with a dark side\\".<br /><br />Best friends Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johnasson) travel to Barcelona, Spain, for a summer-long vacation.  Vicky, engaged to be married, is the practical one and Cristina is a failed artist with a free spirit.<br /><br />Shortly after their arrival, the girls meet Javier Bardem, a sexy artist with a jealous ex-wife (Penelope Cruz), who immediately invites them to come away with him for a romantic weekend.<br /><br />Vicky is appalled, but Christina is game, so Vicky goes along to keep her friend out of trouble.<br /><br />It isn't long before the handsome Bardem beds both of the girls, but then the unstable Penelope appears on the scene, which definitely complicates matters.<br /><br />Allen has written some marvelous, restrained and humorous scenes for his film, which examines the volatility of human relationships.  The scene in which Bardem proposes that the girls go away with him is classic.<br /><br />Director Allen has also extracted fine performances from his cast, particularly Cruz who appears late in the film.<br /><br />Also impressive is Rebecca Hall, who might very well become a major star.  Whenever she is on the screen, your eyes are focused on her.<br /><br />© Michael B. Druxman
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Based on a true story, \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" is a film that most people who are trying to make something out of their lives, against all odds, can relate to. Will Smith portrays Chris Gardner, a man who has most elements of his life stacked against him. He has no college education, a bad marriage and a commission only job that is going nowhere.<br /><br />After losing his apartment, his wife and all of his money, he reaches a bleak, desperate point in his life where he is inches away from losing the one thing that matters most - his son. This tear jerker/feel good story exemplifies what's best in the human spirit. Gardner pushes forward to overcome adversity and rises to the top from the ashes of failure.

0545128285|5.0|J.K. Rowling has once again proven her great talents with this companion piece to the Harry Potter series, mostly to the final book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The tales presented in this short book are original, entertaining and very complete, with unexpectedly complex morals, and the style in which they are written gives the feel that they truly are very old stories, passed on for many generations, and use wizarding rules and terms giving the illusion that they are intended for young wizards and witches.   The \\"commentary\\" by Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore (!) is invaluable. Wise, insightful and funny as always, it feels like a visit from an old friend and is a very welcome gift to all of us who greatly miss the Professor, and most importantly, reveals some snippets of information that enrich what we know from the previous volumes.  To all the fans, do not miss this book, it is not as loosely related to the Potter series as you might think, and sparkles with the genius of J.K. Rowling.

B000003N89|5.0|Diana Krall scored a hit of her own with this very beautiful tribute to The Nat King Cole Trio. All for You: A Dedication to the Nat King Cole Trio certainly could have had more than twelve songs to it; but what we do get is choice material! Diana sounds great and the emotion in her voice is touching. The artwork is very pretty and the quality of the sound is excellent.<br /><br />\\"I'm An Errand Girl For Rhythm\\" has a great jazzy arrangement; and Diana handle the subtle tempo changes like the champ she was and still remains! The music that goes along with her singing is very well done. \\"Gee Baby, Ain't I Good To You\\" is a major highlight of this CD; Diana delivers this by giving her blood and the piano solo is enchanting to say the least. \\"Gee Baby, Ain't I Good To You\\" is an example of The Nat King Cole Trio at their very best when interpreted by a modern day artist. Similarly, \\"Frim Fram Sauce\\" was always a favorite Nat King Cole Trio tune of mine. Diana sings \\"Frim Fram Sauce\\" to perfection--and beyond! Diana sings this like the professional chanteuse she is; and the catchy melody along with the memorable lyrics make \\"Frim Fram Sauce\\" a great number.<br /><br />\\"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\\" is clearly a more somber, pensive number than \\"Frim Fram Sauce.\\" \\"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams,\\" nonetheless, gets the royal treatment by Diana Krall and Nat King Cole and his buddies would be proud if they heard this today! \\"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\\" is yet another major highlight of this CD.<br /><br />\\"Hit That Jive Jack\\" has a great 1940s rhythm to it; and \\"Hit That Jive Jack\\" really DOES swing and that's grand. \\"I'm Thru With Love,\\" on the other hand, reverts to a more somber type of torch song that reminds me of what the great Billie Holiday might sing. Diana delivers \\"I'm Thru With Love\\" with great sensitivity and panache and the musical arrangement complements her singing flawlessly. Listen also for \\"A Blossom Fell\\" with its very beautiful piano playing. \\"A Blossom Fell\\" gets a fine treatment by Diana and the musicians who never miss a beat. The CD ends very well with Diana Krall performing \\"If I Had You.\\" \\"If I Had You\\" simply must have been an instant classic; this number has class and Diana infuses it with a certain type of romantic flair that strikes me with its magnificence.<br /><br />This is certainly an \\"essential recording\\" as Amazon claims it to be! I highly recommend this album for fans of the great Diana Krall; and people who remember The Nat King Cole Trio will enjoy this as well. The terrific musical accompaniments come to us mostly by Russell Malone on guitar and Paul Keller on bass. In addition, people who like classic pop vocals will not be disappointed.by Diana and the musicians who never miss a beat.

0061245097|4.0|\\"One Foot in The Grave\\" takes place four years after Cat leaves Bones to start a new life working for a government group that goes after vampires.  Being half-vampire and half human, Cat wasn't given much of a choice but to join the group, but has found that she enjoys it and cares for the men that work for her.  Vampire hunting is dangerous business and with a team that only sees vampires in terms of black and white, Cat knows that even thinking about Bones, her vampire ex-lover would be a recipe for disaster.  But Cat does think of Bones daily and wonders if he still loves her.  Now Cat has somehow caught the eye of a Master Vampire who wants her to add to his collection of oddities, and whats more odd than being the only vampire/human out there?  To add to matters, the vampire happens to be Bone's sire.  Bones and Cat happen to meet up again and realize there is still love there.  Now she must be willing to let the 'cat' out of the bag to her collegues and her mother and Bones must be willing to turn against his sire and friend to protect Cat.  Wow!  This book was amazing!  I have to say that Bones and Cat (for all their faults) are among the brightest, most exciting paranormal couples out there!  Despite some slow dragging at the beginning, and a few momemets where I felt lost (perhaps forgetting some detail in the first book), this book was a solid four star, maybe four and a half stars.  The entire last third of the book was breath taking and had the most fun ending that I've read in a long time.  The last intriguing chapter was just icing on the cake.  The diaglouge was always entertaing...Cat says some pretty off the wall things.  Bones is just 'vampire' enough to keep him from being some sappy romance hero.  There is a sex scene that was completely different from anything I have ever read before (and that is saying a LOT).  It was the most original sex scene I have read since Anita had her semi-beastiality scene!  Thank goodness this didn't have that gross out factor.  Basically, this book rocked and the series completely stands out from anything around it.  If the book could have had the momentum it had at the end, at the beginning as well, this would have been a five star book.  Jeanine Frost is certainly a stand out in her field.out factor.

1567184855|5.0|Here is an incredibly well written, documented, and executed book on the nature of the cycle of life and death.  Where else are you ever going to find anything as remotely well documted as this book and his follow up \\"Destiny of Souls\\"?  Brian Weiss is excellent, but does not have near the documentation as Dr. Newton.<br /><br />This book provided proof positive of the fact of reincarnation, life after death, learning lessons on school house earth, our impermanent reality in the physical realms, etc.  I was able to extrapolate real life lessons and a sense of comfort from these amazing books, the knowing that we'll keep doing it until we get it right.  And, that life is more about experiences than it is about achieving things.<br /><br />I rank this book as one of my top ten best spiritual books of all time.

1604590483|5.0|Dr. Joseph Murphy is one of my personal hero's and it pains me that I never got the chance to attend one of his workshops before he died.  His book, \\"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind\\" completely changed my life forever.  It was one of the very first spritiual books that I've ever read and inspired me to look more deeply within myself.  It also convinced me that it was time to take responsibility for the life that I was creating.<br /><br />This book is a magnificent work, giving story examples for every lesson given.  You can't walk away from this book without feeling empowered and refreshed.  It is yet another book that I utilized in the writing of my own book \\"Reality Creation 101\\".

B00006CXSS|1.0|I give this movie a 1 for its accessibility.  I love the movie and give it a 5 star rating, however, it is not accessible to those of us with hearing loss.  I have purchased two versions (over $100) just trying to get to watch this movie.  If I spoke Spanish I would be fine.  the captions do not work on any TV and show up as being blank. When I watch it, my family gets tired of having to interpret it for me and explain what is being said. I know that there is English captions out there, I have seen them on TV. So why can we not get them with the movie?  I am feeling a little left out on this wonderful movie.
B001EOQWEO|3.0|My family loves this movie. However, I had no idea what digital copy meant but it involves downloading the full movie from the disney (?)/pixar website. There are three cds enclosed and the one with the movie is just a prompted internet disc that takes you to enter your code found on the box. If I had to purchase this movie again I would never buy the digital copy not only because it is wasteful which is ironically what the movie speaks against (mass consumption) but because it is a pain in the neck to have to wait for a movie to download if you have a slower than normal internet connection. As for the movie....again, my family (3 year old and 2 year old boys who aren't hooked into the brain-draining television habits I was as a kid, thank god) really loved this but when there are hundreds of cheap plastic toys devoted to the movie that acts or could act as a harbinger of the fate of our consumerist society I am aghast at how no one is shouting \\"STOP CONSUMING...don't you get the movie's message at all?!!!\\"
0385338732|4.0|Very positive fairy tale as always. I was travelling down the Nile and read \\"Remember me?\\" instead of bying women's magazines. Excellent substitute. There are many \\"he was dressed in this and she was dressed in that\\". A sort of \\"Devil wears Parada\\" concept of Cinderella turning into a Princess and then divorces the Prince. But in \\"Remember me?\\" Cinderella remarries.... another prince!     The plot brilliantly falls into the category of a \\"easy holiday women's read\\". The writing is great and gives you plenty of unexpected twists and turns, so you won't get bored. Requires no thinking but gives a lot of dreaming plots, like \\"I wish that happened to me\\". But not as good as shoppoholic.  Recommended for INFP types.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|Like so....SO many others, i wish that there were still only 3 Indiana Jones movies. This one was made way to late, and with no imagination whatsoever.    Its more typical Hollywood drivel born to capitalize on this once proud franchise. They tried their best to live up to the first 3, but came nowhere near it.    So i gave a 3 for that effort, an effort that would have been better spent on a new franchise or a new idea.

B000W4E3OS|4.0|First things first--this set does NOT offer the complete Scriabin solo piano music--ONLY THE WORKS WITH OPUS NUMBERS. This is not made clear in the various sites advertising this set, but that IS the case. Ms. Lettberg leaves out enough early, posthumously published Scriabin to fill another CD, but more about that later.<br /><br />Lettberg plays everything in this set spectacularly--no need to hesitate because of an unfamiliar artist! As can be seen on the accompanying DVD, she tosses off this difficult stuff with relaxed nonchalance as if it were basic Czerny. She also understands the style, playing with flexible rubato, and a nervous intensity and hothouse passion absolutely de rigeur for this composer, and her tempi seem absolutely right. Her rhythmic capriciousness is appealing and stylistically appropriate, although sometimes (rarely) it leads her into slight rhythmic inaccuracies (i.e., the eighth, dotted eighth , sixteenth triplets in the first movement of Sonata No.3--she plays some of these as equal eighths. She also  cultivates the nineteenth-century habit of anticipating her right hand with her left. Still, judging from the evidence of cylinders recorded in 1910, this was not foreign to Scriabin's own playing, and considering the many other good points of this set, can be overlooked. (Hamelin is more straightforward; so is Ponti, but not so well-recorded.)<br /><br />The piano is a bit clangy in the treble and occasionally a little boomy in the bass (a tone control setting of treble at 9:00 and bass at 10:00 easily solved this for me). Lettberg's tone colors are varied and appropriate. She is also very conscious of inner voices, and lets them come through--VERY important in Scriabin. Early in his career, the composer injured his right hand through over-practice--yes, it's possible! Surely the forced period of practice with his left hand alone caused Scriabin to appreciate the rich tonal and contrapuntal possibilities of the baritone register of the instrument. He exploits this throughout his works, and pianists like Piers Lane are wrong to downplay it.<br /><br />But, to get back to Ms. Lettberg--there is a LOT of music here, and perhaps it is unfair to expect her to be equally excellent in all of it. Nevertheless, for the sake of absolute honesty, I chose to withhold the fifth star. I enjoyed this set tremendously, but just occasionally, in certain pieces, found myself wishing for more wild-eyed intensity (Vers la flamme, the Etudes Op.65, and Op.8 No.12). Not that Lettberg doesn't usually supply this quality when needed--her Sonata No.6 is wonderfully savage when called for (indeed she's especially good in the late works). It's just that there are a few pieces where she seems a little laid back, when she should be baring her fangs.<br /><br />That said, Lettberg's set is a astounding achievement--full to the brim with exciting, sensuous and sensitive Scriabin playing--and the sound is certainly better than Ponti's set. For Scriabinists, this is a MUST BUY-you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />ATTENTION SCRIABIN COMPLETISTS!: you may want to supplement Lettberg's set with Coombs' CD, \\"The Early Scriabin,\\" for Hyperion. This will give you everything except the \\"Albumleaves\\" in A-flat and F-sharp and the \\"Fantasy for Two Pianos.\\" If you are a mad, manic and insatiable Scriabin completist (...am I alone and unobserved?--then let me confess! I AM one!), you might even want to supplement Coombs with Ponti's 5-CD set of miscellaneous piano music for VOX. This will give you even those three esoterica, plus an Op.8 No.12 alternate version vastly more electrifying than Coombs'.<br /><br />Update of 5/7/2013: Purchasers might be interested to know that Classics Online is offering the complete set (minus, I presume, the DVD) for download for $79.92. As of this date the NAXOS website is offering the set, so, for now the future of the set seems secure.<br /><br />Further important news: Ms. Lettberg has recorded a CD containing all of the missing unpublished pieces, including a few new discoveries, and the few works by the composer's son, Julian. Presumably, this will eventually be available in the US.g all of the missing unpublished pieces, including a few new discoveries, and the few works by the composer's son, Julian.

B000MRAAJW|5.0|HDdvd version....ignore the comments reviews/reviewers who give the product a low score because they did not have the appropriate hardware...is that the fault of any medium?  No.  That would be like me buying diesel for my non diesel car, or even buying ANY optical disc and trying to play it on a vinyl turntable...not good, seriously people.  (Such travesties of reviews should really be noticed by the Amazon staff and never allowed to be posted).  HDdvd is HDdvd, not \\"hi def\\" Bluray or vice versa.<br /><br />That said, Sir David Attenborough delivers onto us his knowledge and passion of nature in one of it's best forms, in High Definition.  If you've ever seen it in HD via satellite (may be the same via cable) you may have witnessed it's pixels galore with the high compression schemes employed.  Not so with disc media.  On that note, this is narrated by Attenborough and not Weaver, just to reiterate.<br /><br />This depicts life in all it's glory and tribulations.  To witness how difficult and challenging it is for our little planetary brethren is to understand how truly challenging life can be and that we should not take for granted how easy it is we actually have it.  The best parent around is the Emperor Penguin father, and we can only hope to strive for such devotion.  Nature is wonderful.<br /><br />A truly masterful work for edutainment titles and a vital component in the library of all who love nature, learning, and expanding the mind.
B001HN6972|5.0|\\"The Reader\\" is a wonderful, poignant film that asks and does not try to answer tough questions, and leaves the viewer moved beyond words.<br /><br />In late fifties' Germany, Michael, a 15 year-old boy crosses paths with Hanna, an engimatic, thirtyish tram car employee played by Kate Winslet. They quickly begin an affair. The affair is marked by torrid lovemaking, and Hanna's constant request for the boy to read to her. The affair runs the course of a summer, and then Hanna disappears. Years later, as a law student attending a trial for class, Michael is shocked to see that Hanna is on trial along with several other women for being a concentration camp guard.<br /><br />From here, the movie asks those questions that don't have answers, or if they do have answers, they are difficult ones. What is the nature of evil? How do you separate duty and decency? Is there is any secret worth losing your freedom, even your life?<br /><br />The performances here defy description. Kate Winslet continues to confirm that she is one of the best actors of this or any other generation with an astounding, fearless performance that will undoubtedly rank as one of her alltime best. Her Hanna is rife with contradictions, and seems to gain and lose sympathy and humanity with rapidity. Ralph Fiennes continues to build his career at risk of typecasting by often playing emotionally repressed characters, and his adult Michael, whose memories set the film in motion, is heartbreaking in his inability to have any joy or communicate love and affection. And David Kross gives a splendid performance as the young Michael, whos goes through the gamut of emotions as he lives and learns hard lessons through his relationship with Hanna.<br /><br />This film belongs on the top ten list of 2008's films. It is masterful.
B000P0J05G|5.0|HDdvd version.  Great visuals.<br />If you're not familiar with Bruce Campbell's work or this movie, get Army of Darkness.  It's an \\"adventure\\" movie with the perfect blend of humor and \\"cool\\" delivered by Mr. Campbell.  This might make some males go out there and try to emulate Mr. Campbell as Ash, but let's hope not.<br /><br />I don't have to narrate for you a summary of the movie, you can easily find the storyline out there on the net.<br /><br />This is a pre-CGI effects movie, but the effects are fabulous and not out of place.  An early 90's film that has no dated appearance at all.  It's also one of those theatrical anomalies that never took off in it's theatrical release, but made up for it in home video.

0321544080|4.0|After buying lots of photography equipment and reading many \\"standard\\" photography books, I thought I need to improve my creativity and to learn how to think as a photographer. So I thought it will be nice to have a book with some great pictures which also have a description of \\"what the photographer was thinking and what made him take this picture\\" beside each picture. THIS BOOK IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR!!!  It is not a book for beginners. It will not tell you how to set the camera and it will not give you the basic tips that you can find on any other book. It is mainly about lighting and creativity. And most of the tips are relevant only for professionals (he uses serious light sources, most of the time more than one, and most of the time it is not a simple flashgun. I don't think that many hobbyists have such equipment). However, even though I don't have the equipment, it is nice to see the thinking behind the pictures.    My only complain is the writing. He uses slang very intensively. Professional slang and street slang. Maybe it is nice for a native English speaker, but it is very hard to follow if your mother tongue is not English (American English). And as you can probably see from my writing, I am not American...
B00006FDCD|3.0|This is a movie based off of the wildly popular (and LONG) novel by Stephen King. Aired on ABC in two parts in 1990, this TV movie clocks in at about three and a half hours.  But it's still pretty mediocre.    PLOT  This movie is about seven outcast kids who live in Derry, Maine.  At the same time, a blood-thirsty monster that disguises itself as a clown named Pennywise.  These kids decide that they are going to kill this clown once and for all.  And they do, or so they think, until the monster resurfaces and they must all rejoin to take it down once and for all (again).    THE GOOD  This adaptation is not terrible, as a matter of fact, considering all that they had to cut from the book, it's actually pretty good.  The first part is really good, considering the main characters are all kids.  All the youngin's perform there parts very well, and Tim Curry looks like he's having a hell of a time as Pennywise.  The special effects are done as well as expecte (with the exception of one time), and it runs very clear as a story.    THE BAD  The second part.  This takes place in there present, after all the kids are grown up.  Nobody in this cast is really likeable, nor do they do any justice to the parts they were givien.  Just aswell, Tim Curry, the only really good adult actor in this movie, rarely shows up here.  Also, for any blood and gore seeking horror fans, look elsewhere, this film never really makes it past suspenseful, and although it is good, anyone looking to be truly SCARED, will be disappointed.    THE UGLY  The final showdown with the monster is the ultimate pitfall for this film, and nearly cost it one star. It's disgracefull, making a mockery of all that came before it.  It suffers from the same disease that the book's ending did, lack of a conceivable, cohessive ending.  So, they just let go and came up with the most shocking thing they could think of.  It ain't good.    Overall this is an OK film, bogged down by a subar second half, and a sham of an endbattle.    3/5

B00127RAJY|4.0|In an effort to not repeat that which has already been said about this amazing 3-workout DVD, I will tell you a bit about it that hasn't been written.    Jillian spends 1 minute on warm-up, 3 repetitions of 6 minutes of her unique workout system (cardio, abs, and strength), and 1 minute on cooling down (~20 min/workout). The DVD comes with 3 workouts: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. I'm in my late twenties, am in above-average shape, and I run on an elliptical machine regularly. I did Jillian's beginner workout 5 days ago and I'm still paying for it because the muscles she works are ones that rarely get used and I wasn't adequately warmed-up. So, if you get this latest Jillian Michael's triumph, understand that the warm-up provided isn't sufficient on its own, but the remainder of the workout is, most likely, the best you're going to get in 20 minutes. That said, I highly recommend this selection, but hope you'll heed the warning to prepare your body for Jillian's workout a few minutes before you attempt the 30 Day Shred. Other than that, you'd be a fool to not buy this immediately! Good luck!
B001BIL2H0|5.0|I first heard outtakes of this project at a college in Connecticut. I think it was U-Hart; it might have been UConn New Britain, regardless, it was an effort that members of several SF bands put together with two stages and a combination of recorded and live music that went on for hours and hours and was just amazing (or boring as Jai-Lai without gambling, depending on your chemical interests).   Within a week or so I'd laid hands on a copy of the album, and wore out three before the CD came out (earlier than it should have). It is one of those albums that is...well, really, really good. Yes, I did miss Jorma Kaukonen's guitar work, but Jack Casady's bass was (due to some technical improvement in recording technology) his best ever. Garcia's guitar work was refreshing and inspired. The piano work is among the best I've ever heard on a rock album. I did not miss drums at all, on those tracks where it's absent, and I think that is the single thing that puts this album into a special category.  Until this album came out rock albums without drums were as scarce as four door Thunderbirds. Turning Point by John Mayhall is one; I cannot think of another.  Of course, there is the aspect of 'concept', and this is one of those projects. But then every Airplane album was a sort of a concept. Or an experiment. Then there is the aspect of technology, where the Airplane made a point of highlighting how many channels of audio were available to their sound engineer (Pat Irecia (sp?) when it was recorded. But the CD I have was recorded at the lower level (-55b) whereas newer recordings are made at -45db. At the time, bands were tripping over each other trying to make concept albums. Since this one has an actual plot, the first song can be forgiven for its over the top political rhetoric. From that point on, this album takes flight as few other albums ever have. From 'The Baby Tree' onward, this is a genuinely original work of pure inspriation. Grace Slick's vocals are clear and, foronce, rooted in realism.  I have a unique perspective on this album. My sister was a nurse at SF General (maternity, OR) when Grace Slick showed up very, very pregnant. I got a blow by blow description of the birth. My sister had no idea who 'the guy with the scarf' was, but he did leave some cool brownies behind.  Listen, and listen closely. Sure, time has moved on and this album is no more than a snapshot, but it's good reminder of what went on before.
B000E6ESL2|3.0|A bit srange and confusing, but worth a second view.  Not really a \\"thriller\\" or \\"Horror\\" movie as you may assume from the DVD case notes and description.  this is one of those films that when it's finished you will sit around and discuss what the director was trying to say or you might just go \\"Huh?\\"
B000PC0U1W|5.0|I've been wanting to pickup this movie for a while now on BluRay.  This is a great action packed movie with some absolutely great visuals.  Natalie Portman has an interesting role in this movie and she does a fairly good job.  Check it you...you will enjoy it.
0307383415|5.0|I finally had a chance to pick this up and wanted to finish it prior to the innaugration tomorrow, and I did with time to spare.  Obama presents a well written story of his life.  Of course during the election campaign we did learn alot of this, but it was worthwhile reading even if you thought you knew what  he needs to know.  An interesting perspective from the man who will be President shortly.
140120841X|5.0|This is an awesome Graphic Novel.  I even have it up as one of my top 10 fav. books.  This is different from the Movie, JUST ENOUGH, that it's just as amazing, but a tad different.<br />The Redemption and Changing of the World has never been so poignant.
0545128285|5.0|I bought this for my daughter who is 9. She has read the first Harry Potter book and watched all the films.  I have read her the last 3 books.  Needless to say, we are big fans fo the series.  I have been anxious to read Tales of Beedle Bard, but she won't give it to me. She is savoring it and won't let herself finish it.  How cool is that?  Seems like a great book for a kid.  (I am a kid too when it comes to reading. )
B000YXMMAE|5.0|This album stays in my rotation. The music is timeless and fill any emotional void per the listener. Highly Recommended.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|This is one of the best movies for kids and adults in a long time. And it is great not to have to worry about   any bad language for my toddler to mimic. WALL-E is cute, funny, and kid friendly. Blu-Ray makes a big   difference in watching this one. It is awesome. I'd say WALL-E and Cars are by far the best Blu-Ray kids  movies to watch. Highly recommend this one. And the extra digital copy is great if you travel and have a  dvd player or laptop you take with you. It is nice to have the convenience of both versions.   Definitely worth the money. And we don't get bored of it since our 3 year old dtr wants to watch it over  and over. :)

B0007MWZEK|1.0|I bought this little sweeper purely to pick up dog fur off the hardwood floor in between cleaning with a real vacuum.  I brought it home and couldn't wait to use it. My floor was relatively clean, I had just vacuumed the night before, and when I went over the floor with this sweeper it didn't pick up any of the dog hair. It pushed it around or got caught in the front.  Let me repeat, it couldn't pick up a few strands of dog hair!  If you have any animals I would suggest using a brush and dustpan over this piece of junk.

B000YABIQ6|5.0|I bought this for my dad who caught just one episode of Season Two so he could catch up...he loves the show and LOVED getting this gift
B000U7169M|5.0|I loved the action, special effects, plot twists, and in the end the beautiful anna sophia robb being the angel of God on Earth come to slay the wicked was simply awesome! I absolutely loved the plot and the acting and sound were superb. Hillary Swank was excellent as well. They could not have cast these two better.<br /><br />I think Idris Elba was mis-cast -- probably to politically-correctly couterbalance the first part of the film where Hillary Swank's family was killed by machete for voodoo reasons in Africa by blacks... Can't have blacks being the voodoo bad guys and that's it. Come to think of it, the whole film was aimed at the plantation / deep traditional south types as being just as voodoo as the Africans -- a sort of spiritual affirmative-action? There is only one problem. We know the average IQ of Africans is around 67, but for American whites the average is over 100... so that part was hard to swallow. Africans are way more voodoo than southern whites ever dreamed of being. (That's why they turn the Catholicism that colonialists forced on them into Santeria..). So what's up with that? Lets stop beating up on southerners and promoting negative stereotypes that are untrue. Pretty nitpicky, I know... At least it was not as blatantly political as \\"Villiage of the Damned\\" or \\"Schindlers List\\" or something. This part of the review can be chalked up to my personal views though -- I HATE POLITICS. Why does it ALWAYS have to rear it's ugly head in my movies? I don't like feeling like I'm being taught something at a Norman Lear festival (you know, mr. TV-shows-are-for-social-engineering himself.) I don't like commercials, not even more subtle 2-hour ones for anyone's non-universal interests or greed. There. Rant done.<br /><br />Other than that, I truly do not understand the negative reviews (except by maybe religious or southern religious people...?). This was a great movie -- suspenseful, gripping, powerful. Great acting. Great sound. Great special effects. If you liked Anna Sophia Robb in \\"Because of Winn-Dixie\\" and \\"Bridge to Terabithia\\" then you will love her in this too as an angel of God. She is great.you liked Anna Sophia Robb in \\"Because of Winn-Dixie\\" and \\"Bridge to Terabithia\\" then you will love her in this too as an angel of God. She is great.

B001PKHS68|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock made two kinds of movies: bone-chilling thrillers that looked into the dark side of human nature, and witty adventure stories.<br /><br />\\"To Catch A Thief\\" is a sterling example of the latter kind of movie -- a chic, sleek, golden-tinted caper, full of witty dialogue and solid acting from legendary actors. Despite the taut action scenes, Hitchcock makes it feel almost like a cinematic vacation.<br /><br />Paul Robie (Cary Grant) was \\"The Cat,\\" the most notorious jewel thief in Europe, before he retired. But now impossible heists -- made in Robie's style -- are popping up all over Cannes, and he's the immediate suspect. Narrowly escaping the police, he enlists a friend to help him clear his name by capturing this new Cat.<br /><br />To do that, he masquerades as an American tourist, and gets to know pretty oil heiress Frances Stevens (Grace Kelly) and her mother. But when the Stevens jewels are stolen, Frances brings the cops down on Robie -- and now he is more desperate than ever to find the Cat, because he suspects it's an old friend...<br /><br />Hitchcock was in fine form with \\"To Catch a Thief,\\" especially since he had two great actors in the mix. Granted this isn't one of his more insightful or suspenseful movies, but it captures a sense of sly wit and fun instead.<br /><br />If \\"To Catch A Thief\\" has a problem, it's that astute viewers will be able to guess who the Cat is after about a half hour, maximum. But fortunately viewers can be distracted by Hitchcock's knack for razor-sharp dialogue (\\"What do you say?\\" \\"My only comment would be highly censorable\\") and double entendres (during an intimate lunch, Francie asks, \\"You want a leg or a breast?\\").<br /><br />It's also gorgeous to behold -- he entire movie is bathed in the golden Riviera sun, with lots of swimming, fast car chases, elaborate costume balls, and ornate hotels. But Hitchcock winds it up with a genuinely tense rooftop chase, complete with wrestling and gunshots.<br /><br />Grant is a bit grizzled (and VERY overtanned) here, but still dapper and charming enough for Robie, a thief with principles and a taste for the good life. Kelly is also quite good as an heiress who is less prim than she appears; John Williams and Jessie Royce Landis have fun supporting roles as a \\"veddy veddy English\\" insurance man and a shrewd rich woman.<br /><br />And apparently the studio is doing right by \\"To Catch A Thief\\" -- the two-disc Centennial edition has featurettes on film censorship, stars of the 1950s, \\"making-of,\\" \\"appreciation of,\\" travelogue, galleries, something about somebody named Edith Head, and even a commentary by a Hitchcock film scholar.<br /><br />a commentary by a Hitchcock historian, feat<br /><br />\\"To Catch A Thief\\" is a warm, sumptuous piece of classic film, with great dialogue and even better acting.

0525478183|5.0|I enjoyed John's first two novels, Looking for Alaska and An Abundance of Katherines.  I REALLY enjoyed his new, very different novel, Paper Towns.  John  tends to challenge my logic and intellect  with his eccentric characters, but I could relate to practically the whole cast in Paper Towns.  John captured the loyalties, desires, friendships and intense emotions that envelop teenagers in high school.<br /><br />Senior Quentin Jacobson for years has pined for his neighbor and very hot classmate, Margo Roth Spiegleman. Margo takes Quentin on a wild night of creative revenge against her old boyfriend and gives Quentin adventures he couldn't have imagined. Very nerdy Quentin is exhilarated by life with Margo and secretly hopes for a relationship to develop.  Then Margo is kicked out of her house and runs away, and Quentin dedicates the last weeks of his senior year to find her, dead or alive.<br /><br />Quentin begins his quest with the help of his marching band buddies, Radar and Ben. Through prom night, abandoned strip malls, housing developments and Walt Whitman, Quentin takes us on a journey filled with possible clues to Margo's whereabouts. After he figures out where Margo might be, Quentin leaves his graduation ceremony and his friends join him.<br /><br />Paper Towns has such heart. A story of dedication, loyalty, true friendships and obsessive desires, it reminds us that sometimes we need to reevaluate a quest, and our hearts, once we find what we were looking for.  A must read.
1401923119|2.0|One of my clients under the influence of a controversial New Age guru gave me Bruce Lipton's The Biology of Belief to read because it largely represents my client's world view. I spent an evening going through the book. My reaction was, No wonder. Lately I have had time to read the book thoroughly and make notes. The \\"Notes\\" section of blank pages at the end came in handy so I thank Doctor Lipton for including it. Up front, I must inform the reader that I have had a long career as a deprogrammer, euphemistically known as an exit counselor. In that capacity I am more interested in how someone sets up someone else to accept a belief and more importantly a false belief. Bruce Lipton expresses the same concern but from a different mindset.<br /><br />The author dedicates his book so: \\"Gaia: The Mother of us all. May she forgive us our trespasses.\\" Philosophically Lipton easily fits the New Age paradigm that grew out of the Sixties hippy movement. The old paradigm of science and religion (especially Christian) he says is patriarchal, neo-Darwinian, gene-centered, linear, materialistic, Newtonian, practically loveless and hell-bent. His New Biology is feminist, neo-Lamarckian, epigenetically centered, holistic, quantum conscious, spiritual, and love-directed to White Light. One-star reviewers on amazon.com have taken Lipton's book to task on his misrepresentation of the sciences, so I will not belabor the details. I will say that Lipton includes enough real scientific teaching to easily impress and confuse the non-specialist--and that is a key to grasping why I am critical of Lipton. On the other end the five-star reviewers offer praises glowing in so much white light they brought a tear to my eye.<br /><br />I gathered that Lipton was a research scientist in biology. He mentions being with Stanford University (1987-1992) many times doing research on cells. My contacts among professors at Stanford never heard of him, so I am not sure what capacity Lipton believes he was connected to Stanford. Lipton was also a biology teacher who had an epiphany about the nature of reality in mid-career. He was so excited that he enthusiastically approached a student with the discovery that the cell's membrane is the cell's brain with \\"This is great s#*t!\\" His epiphany eventually led him away from academia on to the New Age lecture circuit where he promotes his New Biology message. Essentially, Lipton sums up his new biology in his intro:<br />  \\"In the immortal words of Tool Time's Tim Taylor: \\"Baaaack the truck up. Is he saying that humans are God?\\"<br />  Well...yes I am. Of course, I am not the first to have said that. It is written in Genesis that we are made in the image of God. Yes, this card carrying rationalist is now quoting Jesus, Buddha and Rumi.\\" (xxvi)<br /><br />Before some of you toss Lipton into the fires of Inquisition, keep in mind that the divine or supernatural aspect of human nature is nothing new. We have only to turn to ancient myths, major religions, cartoons and Shakespeare in Hamlet (What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving how express and admirable, in action how like an angel, in apprehension how like a god!) --or if you prefer, Shirley MacLaine and Deepak Chopra. More to the point, Lipton is another player in the neo-occult revivals. New Thought religions appeared in the late 19th Century after Mesmer and later Phinias P. Quimby stumbled upon mental healing through suggestion and redirecting beliefs. Quimby asserted first that this was Christian science. In other words, Jesus performed his miracles this scientific way and we can do it better--\\"greater things shall ye do...\\" said Jesus to his Apostles. The cults of positive thinking, mind over matter, and being perfect in the moment began in earnest as a result.<br /><br />Now Lipton wants us all to join the party. Let us celebrate the new consciousness together. \\"Many spiritual people anticipate the return of White Light to the planet. They imagine that it will come in the form of a unique individual like Buddha, Jesus, or Muhammed. However, from my newly acquired spirituality, I see that White Light will only return to the planet when every human being recognizes every other human being as an individual frequency of the White Light...Our job is to protect and nurture each human frequency so that the White Light can return.\\" (164). Nice idea but it comes across as suspiciously totalistic--note the language and the narcissism.<br /><br />\\"Many spiritual people\\" were once Ariosophists, Communists, and Futurists a hundred years ago. Those good folks wanted a utopia too and ended up with a Hitler, a Stalin and a Mussolini. Now, I am not implying what many in the Fundamentalist Christian cults imply, that the New Age Movement is some kind of satanic conspiracy. The Satan I imagine would be better organized. Looking to one of the author's heroes, I doubt very much that the Buddha would endorse Lipton's supernatural proclivities. Buddha was prone to avoid metaphysical speculation. As for Jesus, well, we only have to recall what the Gospel says he said about the last judgment and false prophets. Or was he being merely \\"negative\\"?<br /><br />What about the \\"image of God\\" invoked by Lipton from Genesis?  The Jewish scripture maintains in the Elohist tradition that \\"Let us (Elohim) make man in our image, after our likeness\\" (Genesis 1:26). However, in another tradition seen in Genesis 2:7 we find God portrayed as a potter forming man (adam) out of clay or ground (adama). This is why Isaiah 45:9-11 later states: \\"Woe to him who contends with his Maker; a potsherd among potsherds. Dare the clay say to its modeler, \\"What are you doing?\\"\\" Lipton seems to have adopted the typical occultist's confused reality. He wants us to be the holy trinity of God the Potter, man the potter, and Harry Potter all at the same time.<br /><br />The ancients in many traditions already knew what happens when man tries to be God. And they also knew how easily we fall prey to the urge to create God in our image. To put it another way understandable to the quantum conscious Lipton, we have a loooooong way to go before our galaxy cares a whit what we do with our petty Self-realizations. Lipton's New Biology succeeds only in thrusting us back into the same geo-centric universe of the medieval mind. Dear Gaia, forgive us our trespasses indeed.<br /><br />Lipton points to the Inquisition and how it executed Giordano Bruno for defending Copernicus' cosmology supporting the sun, not the earth, as the center of our world. \\"[Bruno] was burned at the stake for this heresy.\\" This is misleading. Bruno was executed, however tragically, for heresy, divination, magic, and alleged immoral behavior. Although Bruno's views on Copernicus were controversial there was no official Church policy on Copernicus and his revolutionary if flawed science at the time. The subtext implied by Lipton is that he is like Bruno, a heretic, thus we are like the unholy Inquisition when we criticize his ideas. Spare me the grandiosity.<br /><br />Oh, then there are those magical, loving bonobos that avoid violence and conflict with happy sex. Lipton begins this section on page 169 with the poet Rumi's words on the power of love and somehow our author drifts into a comparison with a chimp species. Bonobos he says \\"create peaceful communities with co-dominant males and females in charge...They diffuse their diverse energy by having sex.\\" The Wall Street Journal reported in a December 27, 2008 article by Lionel Tiger \\"Of Monkeys and Utopia\\" that bonobos, even females, in the wild of the Congo \\"engage in clearly willful and challenging hunts. Indeed, female bonobos took full part in some ten hunts observed thus far. Another paradise lost.\\" Lipton seems to have relied solely on an earlier 1980s study by Franz de Waal who observed bonobos using sexual resolution while they were in a lab setting only.<br /><br />The bottom line for me is that Doctor Lipton cannot have it both ways. His false dichotomies and poorly researched positions deflate the positive intent of his message. His balloon will not fly except as a capitalist enterprise in New Age literature and workshop circuits. Why capitalist? Read the Addendum and his endorsement of Psych-K that incorporates the controversial muscle-testing type of kinesiology. He seems to enjoy being \\"out-on-a-limb\\" and no doubt he has benefited or he would not be there. As long as Lipton remains in that self-sealing feedback loop he risks living the very thing he teaches us to avoid...like one of his cells adapting to the special environment it likes, for better or for worse.<br /><br />Perhaps the author should revisit his title for Chapter 2: \\"It's the Environment, Stupid.\\"fall prey to the urge to create God in our image.

031606792X|5.0|I was absolutely mesmerized by this book (as I was with the entire saga). I think Stephenie Meyer took Bella & Edward to the next level. It was thrilling and I enjoyed it for so many different reasons. I loved the coven exploration and all the new vampires...Hopefully this won't be the last we hear of these new characters. I am beyond shocked at the people who didn't find this to be one of the best books Stephenie has ever written.  This book introduces the love of Edward, Bella, & Renesmee...only someone who doesn't understand Bella could doubt her desire to be loved enough by Edward to get married and have his beautiful child (her prior fears where related to the mistakes her mother made). For those without children this desire is hard to understand. Before I had kids it definitely wasn't my idea of happy ever after...but things change. I feel that the other discussed let-down from other readers was the Volturi destruction build up being resolved. The brilliance of this decision is that Bella's unique talents are identified and the stage set for future books to delve into the Volturi's desire to have what the Cullen's possess. The Jacob & Renesmee story line would be very interesting as well. I just finished the partial version of Midnight Sun and I can't believe the dreaded wait looming until she writes more. As for me...I appreciate every word Stephenie places on the page and I eagerly await MORE! THANK YOU!

B001KVZ6FC|5.0|*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />If the rumors are true and Walt Kowalski in Gran Torino is Clint Eastwood's last acting role, then Eastwood - the director has staged and performed his grand exit gloriously. Gran Torino has been called not the perfect movie and blamed on handling some very controversial subjects rather heavily. I may agree with these statements but perfect or not, Gran Torino is a fantastic poignant movie with the storytelling at its best, the characters we got to know, to understand, and to care about, their interaction that seem real, and the ending that moved me to no end. I won't say better about my admiration with Eastwood than Roger Ebert did: \\"What other figure in the history of the cinema has been an actor for 53 years, a director for 37, won two Oscars for direction, two more for best picture, plus the Thalberg Award, and at 78 can direct himself in his own film and look meaner than hell? None, that's how many.\\" How many actors can play a character who is in the beginning truly unlikable, hating, angry old racist but during the course of two hours he would turn to you with such different facets that it would break your heart, move you deeply, make you want to have old Walt as your friend, and make you think that Walt's late wife, the only love of his life was a lucky lady? Eastwood pulled it admirably, and I can't think of any other Artist who could.<br /><br />Many viewers and reviewers talk about Eastwood's returning to his most known and admired cult role of Insp. 'Dirty' Harry Callahan', and it is true, but the film is about many many things - about sad loneliness of aging, for once. It is about how hostility, mistrust and contempt for people of different from you language, way of life, traditions, culture, and background can be slowly but gradually replaced by interest, mutual respect, and understanding. It is also about the loss or not even ever having connection with your own family and not finding the way to re-connect. The film shows that it is never too late to change something in yourself, to become better - no matter how long you have to live. The last theme brought to my mind the film made 57 years ago by great Akira Kurosawa, \\"Ikiru\\" - \\"To Live\\". Very different, both films have in common the theme of inevitability of the end of a life and what can be done if the end is close?<br /><br />And what about Gran Torino? It is the rare collector's car of 1972 which sits in Walt Kowalski's (Eastwood) garage. Walt, who had worked 50 years at the Ford's factory in Detroit, Michigan, participated in its assembly and bought it in the same year. Gran Torino was the reason he got to know and involved in the lives of his next door neighbors even though he never planned or expected for that to happen.lm shows that it is never too late to change something in yourself, to become better - no matter how long you have to live.

Anyway, I was very impressed with how much information was packed into this little book. It was a steal for the money. I can not wait until another book comes out by the author will definitely buy it.

B001GKJ2FC|5.0|No, it's not a true story. It is just a brilliant piece of escapism with outstanding acting, effects and soundtrack. Everyone stuck in a dead end job with an a-hole boss will love the final line.  This is the type of movie that makes it worth having Blu-Ray.
B001GQACGO|4.0|I've read in a couple of these reviews that \\"Save The Hero\\" is on the deluxe edition CD as a hidden track. That's WRONG! I just bought the deluxe version from Amazon, and its not on there. As far as I know, \\"Save The Hero\\" is ONLY available on itunes. And that's if you buy the whole CD, which sucks!!     Almost all of the other songs on this CD are really good! I think its the best Beyonce yet.
B000EUDAWG|4.0|This is a wonderful toy for children and I would recomend it to anyone who loves pranks or bugs of an arachnid type. It is great for studying the tarantula anatomy.

B001AW0AJI|5.0|The colors, images, and soundtrack on this film are visual and auditory feasts, Wong Kar Wai is in top directorial form, and the acting is great too!  I am surprized that I haven't heard more about this film, or Norah Jones' acting debut.  She is very very good!  No matter how good the director, editing, and co-stars are, she couldn't pull this off without innate acting talent.  I hope this is just the start of her acting career. Buy this, but buy it on Blu-ray; it's worth it.  I wish it was available on a U.S. Blu-ray release, but the Korean Blu-ray release is region 0, which means it will play on any region Blu-ray player.  This is one purchase you won't regret; you'll find yourself playing it over and over.
B000024C7W|5.0|This is the best music Stevie Wonder ever created! The movie is good too. If  you've never heard it, you've never heard what this man can really do ... and yes, it's old. He was at his peak! He's done nothing this fine since ... sorry Stevie, but it's true. There is no bad cut, no filler, nothing trendy. Every song is a gem, a joy to the ears and heart. I don't care if you believe me or not ... this CD is worth every penny you might pay for it and more!
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|I first saw Celtic Woman on TV (channel 13) and fell in love with their style of music.  The women who sing on this CD have fabulous voices and the instrumental accompaniment is outstanding. Beautiful and relaxing! Highly recommend it!
032147404X|1.0|This book is a list of so called pro-tips and recipes to take good shots...If this book were the only one on the market maybe it'd rate decently... The problem is there is another book called \\"Understanding exposure\\" by B Peterson that is so much better (read my review on this book). With B Peterson you'll understand photography...Save your money and avoid S Kelby sense of humor...
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Just love this movie ,,,scenery ,good music ,great acting ,,,what more do  U need to have the feeling of beeing right there at that island !!!!!  Thank \\"U\\" OMA
B00005PJ8O|5.0|This gripping biography of one of the greatest generals in Wolrd War II grabs your attention from the opening pre-credits speech until the end of the film. George C. Scott gives his greatest performance, and is backed by Karl Malden (best known to TV audiences as starring in \\"The Streets Of San Francisco\\"). Despite a number of historical errors (Patton & General Bradley are portrayed as best friends whereas in real life, didn't care much for each other & Patton's best friend was General Eisenhower, etc) and the toning-down of Patton's actual phrases, this movie is nevertheless a stirring account of Patton in World War II. He had guts and a lot of balls. Rated PG.
B000RSKD6G|5.0|I read this book when it first came out, and it was some of the best fantasy writing in recent memory.  Liking it so much, I sent this book to my 13 year old son for Christmas.  He read it in a week and absolutely loved it.  His only negative feedback was the book ended quite abruptly, and he was asking if a sequel was available yet.  I highly recommend this story for young and old alike.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I was very satisfied with the quality of this game, and the shipping was very quick..would buy from them again..
B000B8QG0O|5.0|There are few sequels that meet the expectations of viewers that loved the first movie.  Even fewer surpass the original films.  The Empire Strikes Back is widely regarded as the best Star Wars film among SW fans, for example.  Toy Story 2 may very well qualify in this elite category - it is easily the equal to Toy Story, and may even be better.  I gave Toy Story 5 stars.  How can you go up from there?  You can't, so this gets 5 stars too.    This time around, Woody gets mistakingly acquired by a collector during a yard sale.  It turns out that Woody is just one of the \\"Roundup Gang\\", and a rare collector's item.  The collector has plans to sell his now-complete set to a museum in Japan.  Buzz, Ham, Slinky Dog, Mr. Potato Head, and Rex mount a rescue operation to try and save Woody.    That the film looks and sounds great is a given.  Pixar had another entire movie (Bug's Life) to perfect the technology started in the original Toy Story.  The new voices needed to be strong to match the quality of the returnees - luckily Joan Cusack (as the Cowgirl Jesse), Kelsey Grammer (as Prospector Pete), and the Little Mermaid herself, Jodi Benson (as Barbie) were more than equal to the task.  But the emotional heart of the film belongs to Sarah McLachlin, she of willowy voice (and a fellow Nova Scotian!) who sings the new song \\"When She Loved Me\\" - a lament by Jesse who remembers the times when she, like Woody, was a beloved and played-with toy, subsequently abandoned by her owner when she grew up.    Although I hate to get philosophical about it, I can't help myself!  The film is a meditation on aging.  McLachlin's song is a female version of \\"Puff the Magic Dragon\\" - another story about an abandoned childhood friend (Puff is an imaginary friend rather than a toy, but the principle is the same).  Ultimately, then, this is a story about life and aging - should you stay safe in your comfortable box (like Pete the Prospector), never risking getting hurt, or should you love with all your heart, knowing that you'll eventually lose that which you love most?  Kids, of course, will not be so philosophical, but will simply enjoy the adventure, the slapstick, and the fun.    And through this whole review, I haven't even mentioned Buzz's subplot.  Let's just say that Emporer Zurg is in for a challenge....    This 2-DVD pack is full of nifty extras, including a director's commentary and some making-of featurettes.  It's a great film in a good collector's edition, and well priced.  In fact (as of this writing - January '09) the two special edition films are cheaper separately than the 2-pack of the two film together.  Here's looking forward to Toy Story 3D (scheduled release: June 2010).
B000VECADA|5.0|You have to love this movie, especially the motorcycles. Saw the real deal and am very impressed, (am a motorcycle photographer)    Some may say \\"Flop\\". I say it HOPS. Great plot and storyline. Cage and Mendez, a great combination. You need to do more productions with them together
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Besides the movie being fun it is loaded with extras that are fun. You can see behind the scenes and even sing along with any of your favorite songs. I highly recommend this for anyone looking to just let go and have a good time. Be prepared for the songs to stick in your head though!
B000000ORE|5.0|This album is an example of why Tesla is still out there, all original members, when other bands from that era have faded to dust. All of the tracks on this disc flow tonally from one song to the next, and it is by far their best work. On other Tesla albums I find myself skipping ahead from time to time, but not on this one. It's a great listen from beginning to end. Should you have the chance to see them live, don't pass it up! They still rock!!!
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Hey dads, sit back with your family and enjoy one of the best inspirational movies ever made.  I know what you're thinking. I've heard some say that this old movie is too much fantasy for the \\"mature\\" man.  But take a moment and look at the father in this movie. He struggles with his desire to fulfill a dream, always being frustrated to move in that direction, only to find that he has done more to help the people he loves than he will ever realize.  I talk to so many dads who see only their failures. Who work toward perfection in their life and the lives of their kids, only to realize that the point was not perfection, but only to give their kids a dad who loves them.  What about your desires for fame and fortune? Maybe you need an angel to come along and help you see what is really important in life.   After all, you possibly do have \\"a wonderful life\\".
B001F290E4|4.0|When singers record a soul or R&B classics cover album, they usually go for the songs that made groups famous in the 60's. Seal didn't go all mainstream. Instead, he offers us nice vocals and fresh instrumentals to classics not usually heard of. \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\" is a known song, but this was the first time I heard it. I really loved Seal's version. And although Seal sometimes lacks the power in his voice that the original vocalists had, this is definately a must have album. He does superb when giving his version of the more mellow songs.    (Too bad the director didn't notice he was singing on the wrong side of the microphone in some parts of the \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\" video. They should be more careful. Specially since it's a beautiful video, with the grainy black & white effect, and lighting that created that 60's feeling.)
B00000JNO2|5.0|I bought this CD for my husband for Christmas.  I ordered it on a Sunday and had it by the following Wednesday.  I would recommend this site to everyone.
B001F7MSFM|5.0|I really enjoyed this one.  Some very good fight sequences.  I would rate this one as good as if not better than the first Hellboy movie.  I've watched it three times already.  It gets a little better each time.  I also discover more things I'd missed the last time around.  Get a group of friends together and have a party while watching!!!
B0019OP0GU|5.0|This film was a huge surprise to me. I had never heard of it, and rented it on a lark. It is so much fun! Who wouldn't love a film about three Depression ophans in England who save their family home by talent and pluck? Beautifully made. You will have a brilliant time!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|The SB-400 is an excellent flash. I am an amateur photographer and it does everything I need it to do. My pictures are great!!. It is totally automatic. I am using it with a Nikon D-80.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|After you get past the rather long narration, and the beautiful postcard images of Barcelona, an amusingly supple story emerges of an artist's taste for beautiful women.  You never quite know who is at the center of this story but Vicky, impeccably portrayed by Rebecca Hall, is the one who ultimately has to feel the impact of the consequences of these interlocking love stories.<br /><br />Javier Bardem plays the rugged artist that proves irresistible as Vicky's and Cristina's summer trip to Barcelona turns into quite a battle for affections.  Woody Allen has a difficult time keeping Penelope Cruz under wraps.  Filled with seething passion, you find yourself waiting for Maria Elena to explode.  Ultimately, Scarlett Johansson proves to be the \\"salt\\" that keeps these simmering emotions in check, while unlocking new feelings of her own.<br /><br />The story moves around quite a bit, taking in some lovely countryside as well as a Gaudi-inspired tour of Barcelona, with Vicky having to navigate a now turbulent sea of emotions in regard to her betrothed.  She may have ceded Juan Antonio to Cristina but now finds herself with many misgivings when her fiance turns up in Barcelona pressing her for an early marriage.<br /><br />Light, yet filled with many trenchant observations, Vicky Cristina Barcelona is one of those movies that casts a magic spell, as Woody Allen searches for the meaning of love in sun-dried Spain.
B000000OF6|5.0|I suppose I may be behind the trend here, but I didn't become a full-fledged Queen fan 'til 1980...why did I wait so long? Well, it isn't so much that I waited, but I just did not have access to the radio like my older siblings did because all the radios were THEIRS, and as the little bro to everyone else, I rarely (if ever) got a chance to dictate what to listen to (and yet I ended up IN radio...who knew THAT was gonna happen?).<br /><br />While I really didn't get into Queen until '80, fortunately my older sister WAS already a huge fan, and I got a lot of my initial interest in the band via my contact with her--lucky me. I instantly fell in love with Bohemian Rhapsody LONG before Wayne & Garth. I liked the unusual vocals of Freddie Mercury, and while you either loved or hated him, there is almost ZERO debate that the man could sing. The incredibly diverse sound that Queen produced was another in a long string of reasons why you can (and should) love their music. Seriously, how can you get more different than 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love' and 'Fat Bottomed Girls'?<br /><br />Some of their music is best described with a giant ?, but by and large, they rocked, pure and simple. Some of their lesser known hits, to all the radio standbys, Queen simply marched to the beat of their own drums, and we are all the better as a result. 'Another One Bites The Dust' became a staple at sports arena's--as did 'We Will Rock You/We Are The Champions' but let's not pass by the bands last studio album, finished just prior to Mercury's death, featuring 'Headlong', another instant classic. I can't help but wonder what were they thinking when they recorded, 'Radio Ga Ga' (as did most of the Western World in general) but there is just NO denying their impact on the world of Rock & Roll.<br /><br />While debates rage on about the definitive collection of Queens Greatest hits, for the average to above average Queen fan, you simply cannot go wrong with this selection here. Want something more? Go buy their individual CD's and get a pure representation of what this band was capable of producing--not to mention it'll be money well spent.ividual CD's and get a pure representation of what this band was capable of producing--not to mention it'll be money well spent.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Item was a gift, arrived in plenty of time, original wrap, unopened, as listed.  Contacted seller to expedite mailing and he was very cooperative.  Highly recommend.
B00002Z88D|5.0|As a Rock and Roll fan growing up with the likes of Kiss, Aerosmith, and Van Halen; Metallica was naturally an instant hit with me.  I appreciated Metallica's edgy hard sound so when I ran across this album, I not being a musician, was skeptical. When the first few bars of music permeated the air, I was left, awe struck.  By the end of the first CD, I was hooked.      In my opinion, this is by far the best Live Rock and Roll Concert album I have ever heard.  The Orchestra adds fullness and body to an already spectacular collection of musical hits.  I think any Rock and Roll fan will thoroughly enjoy this Album.      This is a must have for any music collection.
B0016PM722|5.0|Always wanted one, found it on Amazon for a good price and loved it. Went out and bought a second one. Great for any Star Wars fan.
143911000X|5.0|There isn't much that can be said about this book other than that it is LEGEN - waitforit - DARY. Seriously. If you love How I Met Your Mother and in particular Barney Stinson (which let's be honest; why wouldn't you?) then this is the book for you. It will have you in stictches for hours and it's a great book to carry around and quote at your friends.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My son bought Settlers when in Colorado. He brought it home. We all loved it. I then got one for the family at a toy store that cost twice as much as yours. Yours is a great deal. Bought one for my daughter and one for my niece at Christmas. Will buy more I'm sure. Great price, greater game. Be sure and buy the extension pack so that 6 can play. You will need it!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This dvd will give you everything you want and more. As if the feature itself wasn't great enough there is not only a cast commentary but a MUSICAL COMMENTARY! That's right; a whole new musical in commentary format. Brilliant. To say that Joss is a God of a man would be insufficient; his brothers Jed and Zack are also brilliant, not to mention fellow writer Maurissa. The actors are clearly passionate about their roles and are side spilittingly funny. Neil's talent is so epic that it's a little terrifying. Nathan has that quirky, self assured humour that will have you in stitches and Felicia is a sweet heart one moment and a bottle of insane quirps the next. It's a fantastic ride. And if you aren't satisfied with that, check out the making's of (plural) and the hidden codes and easter eggs for those of us who love a challenge and surprise. This dvd is truly worth every cent and probably a lot more.
0793518326|5.0|A must have for any musician.  This is a heavy book (literally) that has the complete scores, vocals, guitar, keyboard, bass and percussion lines. Guitar leads.....all of it. The definitive reference for this wonderful music.

B00129H7VS|5.0|I come from a military family but have always concidered myself a pacifist.  This is a very good but strong movie about the experience of a wide range of people in a very tough time in war & history.  My first 'Blu-ray' disc. made it even more vivid and exciting.  Shows a range of peoples ability to cope and suceed or not under extream conditions.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This review is coming from an elementary school teacher!  This is the best game you have never heard of or played.  Once you figure out about 5 \\"hard to understand at first\\" rules this is a crowd pleaser for years to come.  It is best to play the game with someone who can teach it to you the first time.  Great game to teach probability, barter, strategy and REVENGE! (haha just kidding).  Hope you will take the time to learn!

0132350882|3.0|Sadly, this book follows a trendy plan by which an intentionally good book about software development can be ruined.    Have the book written independently by several authors. Give each a chapter or two but don't have any prior plan nor edit it afterwards. The result ? Poorly structured patchwork where each author speaks about different things in a different way or even overlaps with somebody else. Mix of old (some - very old) ideas, pieces of knowledge from all over the place, tales from the field, personal idiosynchrasies etc.    Talking about \\"code\\" in general, stick to one language (Java, what else). Include code samples few pages long immediately followed with \\"you see ?\\". To be fair, you are warned upfront that you will have to read a lot of Java code:    --- QUOTE ---  You'll be reading code - lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what's right about the code and what's wrong with it. [...] if you take the time to work through the case studies, following every tiny step, every minute decision [...] then you will gain a much richer understanding of those principles, patterns, practices and heuristics.  --- /QUOTE ---    But it doesn't work this way for me. I don't appreciate reading several pages of consecutive versions of somebody else's Java code. I would rather let the authors extract the mentioned principles and present them in some way easier to digest.    To conclude, another quote:    --- QUOTE ---  So maybe there is a little new here, but in reading this book you will be challenged to take up good disciplines that you long ago surrendered to apathy...  --- /QUOTE ---    If you are up to taking a Java reading challenge, good luck.

Mickey Rourke resurrects his career with a superb performance as Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson, a professional wrestler twenty years past his glory days.<br />2. Randy is totally messed up, physically and mentally, all alone and living from one second-rate bout to the next.<br />3. He gets a shot at returning to the big time with a grudge rematch, but finds that his heart isn't totally into it.<br />4. Marisa Tomei plays Cassidy, a stripper/lap dancer also past her prime, following Elizabeth Berkley and Lindsay Lohan to the dreaded career-destroying pole-dancing sequence.  To her credit, she doesn't look half bad, and this doesn't escape the attention of The Ram.<br />5. Randy has a daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) whom he has neglected her entire life, and does his best to make amends.<br />6. He makes a life-changing decision to stay true to the people who love him.<br /><br />This is a down to earth, gritty and believable look at the backstage side of professional wrestling, and the softer side of the guys who mercilessly batter themselves and each other to perform the dangerous choreography craved by their adoring fans.<br /><br />Between the wrestling action and the pounding `80s music (Quiet Riot, Accept, Ratt, Guns N' Roses, Scorpions) there's a genuinely tragic drama playing out, and the casting, acting, sets and costumes are absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of gritty drama that mirrors real life.<br /><br />Randy 'The Ram' Robinson: I'm an old broken down piece of meat and I deserve to be all alone, I just don't want you to hate me.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, January 18, 2009
1591841666|5.0|This is a fascinating little book that really helped me thrive (not just survive) a difficult business period.  I keep it on my nightstand and often refer to the many highlighted pages after a long day at the office.  I strongly urge every business owner and every worker to read it.  Written in a punchy style, you'll get the message without wasting a lot of time.  It's the kind of book you keep thinking about well after you've read the last page.  I thank the author!
006112429X|5.0|Not to bubble over with hyperbole, but I don't think I will ever be the same after having read this book. The emotional intensity and sheer intelligence with which this book was written astounds me. Not to mention all the other elements firmly in place: drama, mastery of the language, brutal honesty. Though painful and dreadful subject matter, this book needs to read as much as Kevin needs to be talked about. I was sorry to finish it only because I don't know where to go from here in terms of finding a book of similar quality, but I'm sure going to start with Ms Shriver's other books.
B001FEO6PK|5.0|Although there are only a few new tracks here it is still a collection of some of the best guitar music and just plain music, you will hear. Emotional, technical and creative. Jason Becker stands alone.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|Just when you think he's finished, he produces something like this.    In the early 70's, people thought he was done after \\"Wild Life,\\" and \\"Red Rose Speedway.\\" He came back with \\"Band On The Run.\\"    I think he just has a knack for knowing when to deliver.    Amazing.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Love this series, wish it were still going...not sure what they were thinking when it was cancelled.
B001KVZ6BG|2.0|I agree with the consensus that Slumdog is a beautifully filmed and well-acted movie. My problem with it is that it's being perceived by American audiences as an Indian movie, and it's not. It's a Western fairy tale that happens to be set in India. Think Charles Dickens with flashier costumes. And it's precisely the fact that so many viewers will be duped into thinking they're watching a movie about India that I find so troubling.    As an Indian-American, I was hoping that the movie would be both entertaining and insightful about India and Indian people. But unlike Monsoon Wedding, or even the London-based Bend It Like Beckham, Slumdog seems content to rehash tired stereotypes about \\"poor, poor India\\" without digging into people's motivations or cultural beliefs. Of course there are an enormous number of extremely poor people in India. But what makes India so unique - and therefore so compelling for filmmakers with an astute eye - is its complexity. It's confusing and overwhelming and dirty and chaotic, but it's also richly textured and warm-hearted and astoundingly beautiful. Slumdog touches on almost none of these themes. As mentioned above, it's well-acted across the board, but the heavy-handed direction gives the actors no room to \\"be Indian\\" in any authentic way. Think of the most overused cliches about modern India - from Bollywood stars to call centers - and they've all been stuffed into Slumdog in one shape or another. It's Paint-By-Numbers pretending to be serious art.    If you're simply looking for a good-versus-evil fairy tale, Slumdog really will be the feel-good story of the year for you. But please, don't come out of the theater thinking you've learned a great deal about India.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|Having watch \\"White Christmas\\" countless times and \\"Holiday inn\\" several times on television, I was pleased to discover this Colorized version of HOliday Inn.  WOW.  really comes alive.  yes, since colorized, when viewed on HDTV it is not as brilliant bright, etc as newer original color movies, but this adds so much to the movie.   I only wish there would have been more history about the making of the movie but most of the principals were already passed on.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I love the Gilmore Girls! Every year since the show was first released on DVD. I've been watching this over and over, it's that addictive. This DVD set is a must-have for fans [and especially for those fans who've worn out their old DVDs like I have:)]. Here's a recap of each season:<br /><br />Season 1<br />Gilmore Girls  centers around the life and exploits of single mother Lorelai Gilmore [the amazing Lauren Graham] who raises her only child Rory [stunning Alexis Bledel]in the idyllic town of Stars Hollow, somewhere in Connecticut. Its an amazing drama...every episode here in Season One makes you really come to know and love the characters, both main and secondary. We come to care about what happens to Lorelai & Rory...in Season One, 16 year old Rory gets accepted into the prestigious private school Chilton, and Lorelai has to grapple with the problem of how to finance it, and out of desperation approaches her estanged parents for help. The chemistry between the two leads as mother and daughter is electrifying and altogether credible...Lorelai's parents, Emily and Richard Gilmore are portrayed as stuffy, upper-class people who use money as the means to keep tabs on their daughter and granddaughter. Of course, the stories go deeper than that, and the characters themselves develop in greater depth as the series goes on...but herein lies the charm in Gilmore Girls...the dialogue, witty repartee and stellar acting from all characters make this a show that grows from strength to strength and makes an addict of the viewer.<br />The residents of Stars Hollow are an eccentric bunch indeed - be it Luke of Luke's Diner, Ms Patty the dance teacher, Taylor the town councilman,Michel the crabby concierge, Sookie St James the irreverent cook and BFF of Lorelai, Lane Kim as Rory's sidekick - we come to love each of these characters for their roles in the series.<br /><br />Season 2<br /><br />Season Two sees us revisiting Stars Hollow, the idyllic little Connecticut town that is home to Lorelai Gilmore and her teenage daughter Rory. There are some interesting plot developments in this season - Lorelai gets engaged to Max and faces some dilemmas and inner conflict, Rory's stable relationship with Dean, her long-term boyfriend is threatened by the arrival of Jess, a rebellious teenager from NY who also happens to be Luke's nephew, and of course, the turbulent relationship that Lorelai has with her parents, Richard and Emily Gilmore goes through more upheaval. And Luke gets into some romantic entanglements of his own.<br />There are other interesting developments in this season that make GG an addictive must-watch - Rory's rivalry with Paris Geller, Richard's forced retirement and its aftermath, Christopher's re-entry into the Gilmore girls' lives and many more. The eccentric townspeople of Stars Hollow add to the appeal of the show, Taylor Doose's 'dictatorship' of the town goes to new heights, Kirk's manic antics and many more. All of which, coupled with rapidfire witty dialogue that has become the trademark of the show make Gilmore Girls a rare gem amongst TV series - great casting, excellent scripts and beautiful, scenic sets. A must-watch indeed!<br /><br />Season 3<br />Season Three of the Gilmore Girls is one of the best of all seven seasons. In this season, Rory [Alexis Bledel] is in her final year at Chilton private school and faces some of the most trying times, be it manouvering political games within the student body, or the love triangle between her, Dean [Jared Padalecki] and Jess [Milo Ventimiglia]. Alexis Bledel does a wonderful job in this season and truly shows her maturing as an actress.<br />Of course, Lorelai [Lauren Graham] continues to shine in her role as a single mom, best friend to her daughter, and aspiring inn owner. Lorelai, fresh from the romantic disappointments of the previous two seasons finds herself sort of lost, and dates around, never truly finding a soulmate. Diner owner Luke Danes [Scott Patterson] is always there to lend his unwavering support and of course, Luke and Lorelai's chemistry is simply magical to watch, be it as good friends or as two people slowly being drawn towards each other.<br />The rocky relations between Lorelai and her parents Emily and Richard Gilmore [ Kelly Bishop and Edward Hermann] goes through its usual turbulent times and its always entertaining to see Lorelai in action and putting her parents in their place, despite their overbearing attitude. Kelly Bishop's Emily is truly a delight to watch as she plays the snooty, controlling character to perfection.<br />Amidst the changes in the main characters' lives this season, the most significant ones are the Rory-Jess-Dean love triangle, and for once we see Rory getting out of her goody-two-shoes character by going after Jess despite being Dean's girlfriend and the episode \\"They Shoot Gilmores Don't They\\" shows the resolution to this. There is also the college application anxiety, is it going to be Harvard or Yale?<br />Lorelai's dreams of opening her own inn are developed in greater detail this season, as we see her working hard towards achieving that dream, especially with a certain event that acts as a catalyst towards that end.<br /><br />Season 4<br />Season Four was a hard season for the Gilmore Girls, and this was primarily because of Rory's [Alexis Bledel] going off to Yale. This changed the dynamics of Lorelai [Lauren Graham's] and Rory's interaction, being reduced to mainly trying to get each other on the cellphone. There was an element of being lost here for both characters, but especially so with Rory, who after breaking up with Jess in Season three [well, technically it was Jess just walking out on Rory] finds herself trying to adapt to a whole new environment [the only constant being Paris, who is her roomie at Yale] and with no real romantic suitors around.<br />Lorelai finds herself and Sookie seeing their dreams of an inn becoming a reality, though with many problems in between. Lorelai gets romantically entangled with her father's business partner, Jason aka Digger Stiles [Chris Eigeman] and the problems the relationship poses.However, Jason is not really a character that appeals to viewers, coming across as stuffy and unsuitable for Lorelai.<br />Despite these hiccups, there are some truly great episodes which keep viewers entertained [The Festival of Living Art for example, and the episode where Luke realises a certain winsome coffee addict is his true soulmate].<br /><br />Season 5<br />Season Five starts off with a bang, and just keeps getting better with every episode. At the end of Season Four, Rory [Alexis Bledel] sleeps with her married ex-boyfriend Dean [Jared Padalecki] and the beginning of Season Five sees Rory being 'sent' off on a European tour with her grandma Emily [Kelly Bishop], a ruse by Lorelai [Lauren Graham] hoping that things will cool between Rory and Dean.<br /><br />The plot twists in this season are fascinating - Rory eventually finds herself drifting apart from Dean, and drawn towards rich kid, Logan Huntzbeger [Matt Czuchry] which delight the senior Gilmores but not Lorelai. Luke and Lorelai's relationship grows from strength to strength, with some major hiccups in between, no thanks to the interference of Emily Gilmore [Kelly Bishop] and Christopher.<br /><br />The last two episodes of this season truly keeps you riveted as a dejected Rory turns to a desperate act that lands her not only in trouble with the law but also causes a rift between her and her mother, Lorelai.<br /><br />Season 6<br />Season 6 marked a major change in the series in that we see Lorelai & Rory having a huge disagreement, and how this affects their relationship and those around them, but it also shows us that despite everything these two remarkable women are always able to sort things out, and we cheer them on from the sidelines.<br /><br />Season 7<br /><br />Season 7 was  in my opinion the weakest in the series. The absence of Amy-Sherman Palladino's witty dialogue was sorely felt during this season - the rapid-fire banter just didn't sound authentic and many times, the lines felt forced though I must say Lauren Graham tried her best to make the most of what she was given. The focus on Lorelai [Lauren Graham] and Christoper was annoying to me as I never really liked Chris that much, and there weren't enough Luke and Lorelai scenes because of the rift between them. What I really missed most was the absence of character development of the other inhabitants of the town that made up a lot of the show's appeal. Also, Emily and Richard, two `beloved' characters on the show did not get much screen time either - there was just too much of the Lorelai-Chris conflict and that dampened my enthusiasm for this season. And the resolution to the show that culminates in Stars Hollow celebrating Rory's graduation from Yale felt like a rush job - everyone gathers there but it seems forced once again [though I did like the mother-daughter scene at Luke's Diner] and the resolution to Luke and Lorelai also seemed too brief.<br /><br />CONCLUSION - a great TV show and a must-have set here [at the discounted rate offered by Amazon] for GG fans!<br /><br />But on the whole, Gilmore Girls as an entire show from Seasons 1-7 is still one of the best dramas ever shown on television [even though it ended almost two years ago] and I believe it will continue to entertain many more people who love quality TV for a long time to come. It's a true classic!ner, Jason aka Digger Stiles [Chris Eigeman] and the problems the relationship poses.However, Jason is not really a character that appeals to viewers, coming across as stuffy and unsuitable for Lorelai.

CONCLUSION - a great TV show and a must-have set here [at the discounted rate offered by Amazon] for GG fans!    But on the whole, Gilmore Girls as an entire show from Seasons 1-7 is still one of the best dramas ever shown on television [even though it ended almost two years ago] and I believe it will continue to entertain many more people who love quality TV for a long time to come. It's a true classic!
B001B7CNXI|4.0|Michael Mann has the police drama down cold! He scores another hit here with MIAMI VICE. This film is a masterpiece other than a couple of love scenes that could've been left out but then again it wouldn't be miami vice so it's not that much of an issue. What is at stake however is the tight directing, great script, and talented acting duo of Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell. The supporters are also good.<br />  This is a film that needs to be watched more than once. The standard dvd edition does not do the movie justice and I admit I was not much of a fan at first. However with this new directer's cut blu ray, the movie is just so much tighter with minimal changes than the theatrical release. There are so many fine details in this film that you just can't ignore. If you're looking for a great drug ring crime movie than this is your match.<br />  I am not a fan of the tv series but I am a huge M Mann fan and this movie belongs next to a movie called HEAT. Maybe you've heard of it.  Not quite on the same level but all in all a great piece of work from a magnificent director. Give this film a second shot and notice how close the bond is between Foxx and Farrell's charchter's. They know each other and are best friends but they never blatantly shove it down your throat. Picture quality for blu ray is 4.5/5  sound quality is 4.0/5  A must own for fans of the film or crime dramas.
B000002GQE|4.0|I usually listen to Mediaeval or \\"Classical\\" music, but I bought this one because a friend reminded me of it.   I can't believe that after about forty years since I first heard it, I still think of it as one of the great concept albums ever produced.  If you loved the 60s, then this is the album for you!
B000PC6A3E|4.0|If you have a HDTV with a HDMI cable to connect your Blu-Ray player you'll love this movie!
B001N26GFM|4.0|The movie's subject matter, first and foremost is very HEAVY.      The story follows a boy in a particular German military family.  He is your average adventurous and innocent/ naïve eight-year-old boy.  His family is a very ordinary German family, for that time, except his father had just been promoted to a high position within the military, causing the family, much to the children's chagrin, to move out to the country (discovered in the first five minutes of the film).      In this movie, you will see a wide range of acceptance and emotion for the German political agenda.  You'll see the happenings of this family from the boy's perspective, including his introduction to the Jewish people.     In my opinion, this movie is very well made, intelligent, and powerful.  The messages that are being conveyed are wonderful conversation pieces.  It's time to expand horizons and stimulate the brain with this very strong film.  Grab some family or friends, or someone from the office and see what this movie is all about.

1932100660|5.0|In this book Colin Campbell, a nutritionist, reviews data from numerous nutritional studies, especially in China, and comes up with a result that will be surprising to many: a diet in which most protein comes from animal products is a strong contributor to many types of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and many autoimmune diseases. Probably the best argument he marshals is that these diseases are concentrated in parts of the world where animal products are the main source of protein, and when people have moved from parts of the world where incidence of these diseases is low and most protein comes from plant sources to countries where protein comes from animal sources, or when increasing wealth leads to greater consumption of animal protein, incidence of these diseases increases. He provides guidelines for healthy eating that I intend to follow.
1400063515|5.0|This dense book challenges assumptions and long held beliefs. As such, it will delight some and infuriate others. That it questions human arrogance while simultaneously eliciting an arrogance of its own will doubtless cause much brow-furrowing. In the end, it does have something substantial to say, though the basic message is beyond simple. But sometimes the simple requires the most explication, especially when attempting to overturn inertial intellectual habits. To accomplish this, the book mashes finance, philosophy, statistics, literature, cultural studies, economics, psychology, forecasting, and social science into one meandering but nonetheless mostly cohesive volume. The unifying theme of this mutt is the \\"Black Swan\\" or highly unpredictable events with enormous impact (that Black Swans actually existed shocked English explorers). Such events seem to come out of nowhere, like the 1987 stock market crash, the Harry Potter rage, Beatlemania, World War I, etc. But, as the book argues, after the fact we claim we saw them coming (called \\"retrospective distortion\\") and we create a subsequent narrative to \\"explain\\" these phenomena. The book takes umbrage with how confident humans seem in the face of the unpredictable. We think we can predict and explain. The book counters that we're really far worse at these than we think, and this ignorance gets us into trouble. The recent economic crash serves as one more example, and those events have vindicated the author, Nassim Taleb, to some. That the book came out in 2007 and that one of its footnotes claims that Fannie Mae \\"seems to be sitting on a barrel of dynamite\\" (pg. 225) probably doesn't hurt. Taleb's reputation has since soared and \\"The Black Swan,\\" still in hardcover, has surpassed some 30 printings.<br /><br />The book's three parts (and one tiny, almost nonexistent, part) cover different aspects of the Black Swan problem. Part One introduces this problem through the metaphor of the \\"antilibrary\\" or the books not yet read. After all, we know what's in the books we've read. It's those unread volumes that may hold astonishing surprises. Black Swans may lurk within. Whooo! Randomness also plagues the world, but we sometimes try to explain this away via confirmation bias (fitting events to our presuppositions) and narrative fallacies (positing causation where none may exist). These human foibles give us an illusion of control and a seeming antidote to skepticism. Taleb counters that we ignore the \\"silent evidence,\\" or situations where something didn't work (i.e., how a person lost a million dollars using the same advice/tools of someone who earned the same amount). The antilibrary contains, or can contain, silent evidence. Lastly, Taleb separates probability and randomness in the world from that in game theory (he dubs this \\"the Ludic fallacy\\"). The world isn't a game and he argues that we shouldn't treat it as such. We live in what he calls \\"Extremistan\\" (a world rife with Black Swan possibilities), not in \\"Mediocrastan\\" (where smooth bell curves reign). What's important is to know the difference.<br /><br />Part Two deals with \\"The scandal of prediction.\\" Taleb argues that most major innovations were not predicted (he cites the computer, the internet, and the laser) and some were mere accidents (e.g., the chapter entitled \\"How to Look for Bird Poop\\" tells the story of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation's discovery). Though he presents plenty of evidence of how terrible we are at prediction, Taleb doesn't advocate a fraidy-cat mentality. He says \\"be a fool in the right places.\\" Part Three drills into some of the technical details of randomness, probability, and the Bell Curve. Taleb has no qualms about showing his disdain for much of what passes as economics and finance today. In the end, he prefers Mandelbrot to Gauss. A final chapter scolds philosophy for shirking its duty as critical thinking's gatekeeper. He also has unkind words for those who evoke the \\"uncertainty principle.\\" Part Four, as Taleb promises early on, is very short. These some 6 pages sum up what Taleb finds more worrying (e.g., he worries more about diabetes than terrorism). A final epistle reminds us that we're all Black Swans and that we should appreciate just how lucky we are. So things end on a relatively positive note.<br /><br />Many have taken offense at the ideas and opinions Taleb expresses in \\"The Black Swan.\\" He does more or less give certain domains, such as economics and finance, the finger. Sometimes he can barely contain his rage. Add to that his penchant for a messy real world approach and the book can come off like a rambling diatribe. It's not clean and tidy, nor is it meant to resemble a beautiful uniform systematic approach. It's messy, and this reflects Taleb's view of the world. For him to present a linear, smooth as glac&eacute; argument would directly contradict his refutation of attempts at such systems. He doesn't think the world is neat and readily adumbratable and he's fiercely suspicious of work that claims otherwise. So expect digressions, meanderings, non-hermetic arguments, and sometimes the phrase, which many humans fear more than nakedness, \\"I don't know.\\" Readers who don't agree with Taleb's method, or lack of, will nonetheless find challenging and intriguing ideas to contend with. Who knows, they may even encounter a Black Swan of their own, within one of those many yet unread books.

3822855499|4.0|This book is a wonderful collection of work by Atget.  One, at least I, tend to forget just how influential Atget was in bridging documentary photography to art.  One star off because I wish the book had larger dimensions and better print quality, not that the quality is bad.  This is an excellent value for a budget book.

B001HPP2X2|5.0|Dexter has finally made his Blu-Ray debut, and the glossy, well-made series looks wonderful in the format.  Besides some relatively small BD-Live features (including seeing the first episode the third season), there really isn't anything here that wasn't on the standard-def version of the Complete First Season, but for Blu-Ray owners who haven't taken the plunge into Dexter's world, this is definitely worth checking out.  Below is my original review for first season.<br /><br />The interesting concept of this Showtime series makes it reason enough to check it out.  Michael C. Hall (Six Feet Under) plays the title character, who works in forensics for the Florida police by day, and is a serial killer at night. Because of his job and upbringing by a police officer foster father (James Remar), Dexter knows how to cover his tracks while wearing his mask of humanity by day.  Slowly though, things start to take a turn when another serial killer with connections to Dexter's own mysterious past rears his head, and soon enough our title character is caught in a bloody game of cat and mouse.  What makes Dexter so good is the approach taken to the theme of the series by the creators and Hall himself.  What could have easily flopped and failed miserably instead evolves episode by episode as we attempt to see what makes Dexter tick.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well to say the least. Julie Benz (the vampiric Darla from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel) is superb as Rita: Dexter's rape victim girlfriend whom he keeps around so he doesn't have to bother with sex, HBO's Oz veterans Lauren Velez and David Zayas as fellow cops, and hottie Jennifer Carpenter (whom Hall has recently married, seriously) as Dexter's sister.  Not since Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer has there been an interesting and above all chilling glimpse into the mind of a madman that walks among us.  Spectacular, and definitely worth picking up even if you never caught the show on Showtime during it's first season run.season run.
B001GKJ2FW|1.0|I have never had any problems with an Amazon product.  This Blue Ray has been a problem from the start.  I sent the first one back to you and you promptly sent me a replacement.  My wife and I sat down to watch the second one and it did the same thing.  We called the Geek Squad to see if it was our system and it turns out that the second one is defective as well.  I will be sending it back this week.  Again I love Amazon and feel that you have a bad batch.  Hope this helps you.  Gary O'Brien, DDS
159562015X|5.0|Love this book. It's quick & easy. Really interesting to read through all the Strengths. BE WARY WHEN BUYING A USED COPY. Each book has one code to take the test & if it's already been used you will need to purchase a new copy anyway. Codes are not sold seperately.
0446402389|4.0|The first act is almost impeccable. The only problem is Raisa, who has some contradictions. It took a while to know her and once the character develops, where are not sure if the new Raisa is the same as the one that was introduced to us.     All of the sudden, Leo, the main character, starts behaving as a Hollywood action hero. If in one hand we have an intense thriller as few out there, we also have the clichés, inconsistencies and hard-to-believe sequences common to the genre.    The setting is key: The end of the Stalin era in USSR. For sure, that what saves the book from the \\"not-so-special\\" category. The author gives some insight of the life in USSR during that period and the cat-and-mouse chases take place under this background. The same could have been said if the story was in Nazi Germany or another authoritarian regime. However, we don't have many thrillers with the Stalinesque USSR as the locale and that's part of the charm. The author never misses an opportunity to talk about the life style during that era (how the buildings were built, the lineups to buy groceries, the education system, etc.). We feel that we are there. I suffered a lot reading this book. I could feel the cold coming from the snow (I actually caught a very severe cold when I was through 2/3 of the story). It is a very intense book. You have to have guts.    I just wished the hero was not like Brad Pitt (I totally can see a big star like him to be cast on the upcoming Ridley Scott movie). It is okay to have a little bit of excess here and there, but the last 50 pages were too much. It lost one star because of that.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I ordered and watched the new release on Blu-Ray.

0060557818|5.0|The characters in this book are adorable, and Gaiman's imagination is superb, always.  I especially liked the concept that all those vagrants you see in big cities have somehow 'fallen through  the 'cracks' and now exist in a dimension where normal people can only kind of see them.  So buy this gateway drug and get hooked!
B00003CXDD|4.0|\\"Willow\\" is a good movie, but it could have been better if it didn't have so much going on in it. It's a fairy tale story with dwarfs as the central characters. Val Kilmer gets involved as a flawed action hero.<br /> A great deal of humanity and compassion comes through as actor Warwick Davis tries to save a little child whom the wicked queen is trying to destroy. Some of the tiniest fantasy figures in the movie are completely unnecessary for the story and get in the way. Simplify it, cut it to the bone, and this could be a fine movie.<br /> Davis does a fine job of acting and the family values he embodies can teach and be a great inspiration to children and adults too. Everything but the kitchen sink gets thrown into this Ron Howard flick, and yet at its heart it has a sweet little tale to tell which all but gets lost in the telling. Watch Jean Marsh ham it up as the wicked queen.

1595141979|4.0|Rose Hathaway has been diligent when it comes to catching up on her studies--even when she disagrees with what she's being taught--because of her obligation towards her best friend and Moroi princess, Lissa, to become her guardian once they both graduate. Now the time has come for Rose to prove herself in the last stage of her training, and she's more than ready. But a fresh encounter with an old enemy and strange appearances on the St. Vladimir's campus keep tripping her up. All of these are pointing to impending danger, and only Rose can save them if she can make sense of the clues in time.    Richelle Mead's third book in the Vampire Academy series is full of the same pulse-pounding, breathless, and smart action and excitement that made the first two popular. Rose continues to be her sarcastically witty, clever, and hot-headed self, and these self assured qualities are what really continue to make the series appealing. Mead's innovative vampire world continues to be intriguing as she offers a few more glimpses into the background and politics of the Moroi's government and their royal court.     Mead skillfully builds up sense of foreboding and some electrifying anticipation as Rose discovers many things about herself--from magical abilities to emotions she's buried deep down--which culminates in a terrifying and suspenseful battle in which readers will be satisfied to find that Rose manages perfectly. But Mead isn't soft and refuses to leave readers with a happy conclusion, instead finishing off with a major twist (that is maybe slightly predictable) that will leave readers breathlessly demanding a sequel.
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|I don't usually split up a work day to catch a flick, but I started seeing reviews of the movie. I wasn't going to wait for the DVD. I'm glad I didn't.<br /><br />The movie follows the theatrical paradigm from Aristotle's Poetics - as does every contemporary movie I have seen. You need a sympathetic character, an inciting incident, an antagonist, events that flip the action and a setting to take you out of your world. You get a full buzz of them all. You also need a transformation that you can believe and this one has three distinct ones - ones that enlighten and remind you of who you are under the layers of own defense mechanisms.<br /><br />Not to give the movie away, Eastwood plays a broken person whose world view is altered by the love of a neighbor - a persistent young Asian woman with a terrific personality and courageous wit. Her way of relating to others flips Eastwood's character and opens him up.<br /><br />The Gran Torino automobile owned by Eastwood's character is an object of obsession that pulls the diverse characters into dramatic conflict. It's the prop that Eastwood uses as the director/producer to weave the story. This story intrigues and pulls in the viewer. I literally left my model of the world and walked into Eastwood's.<br /><br />I never saw the end coming. I didn't suspect it. How could I? I don't think anything like this exists in the archives of filmography. Each moment of this work takes you to the conclusion and without question places this film in the stratosphere of greatness.<br /><br />Eastwood unsuspectingly snuck another movie into theaters and into our experience. It's probably his best in terms of demonstrating a grasp of humanity. Don't miss it.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|As good as the rest of the seasons 1-3, even though they had the problem of the writer's strike.  The extra features included are among the best ive seen yet and a joy to watch.  Really made me enjoy everything more.  Great buy!

Blu-Ray encoding was top-notch (of course -- computer-generated animation to uncompressed video files *should* turn out perfectly).
0553288105|5.0|Having read a lot of science fiction over the years, and being a big fan of Isaac Asimov, I can't for the life of me imagine how I neglected to read this masterpiece.  Winner of both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, in my opinion, this is Asimov's best work and one of the finest science fiction works I've encountered.<br /><br />The book is written in three distinct parts, seperated by location, though the time frame is more or less contemporaneous (circa 2070).  The first section of the novel sets the stage and takes place on Earth.  Through contact with a parallel universe, with radically different physical laws, a source of free and plentiful energy is discovered, a revolutionary development for human society.  However, there is no such thing as a free lunch, and the remainder of the novel deals with complications arising from the ensuing Electron Pump.<br /><br />The second part of the novel is simply mind blowing.  In it, Asimov has created an alien culture (beings occupying the aforementioined parallel universe) that is so fascinating and complex as to be well deserving of the awards which this novel has garnered.  Were this 50-75 page chapter released as a short story, it would be deserving of the title, \\"Best Science Fiction Short Story Ever Written\\".  The last two pages of the chapter contain two different, shocking plot twists that will literally cause goose bumps.<br /><br />Finally, the third chapter of the story results in an elegant resolution of the crisis presented in the first two.  Set on the Moon, Asimov creates a lunar colony, that while not entirely original, has aspects I've not seen before.  The creativity, while not up to the standards of the second chapter (how could it be) is nevertheless top rate.<br /><br />The story involves complex physics, which Asimov explains well and simply enough to be understood by the average non-scientific layman.  This science fiction work is among the best novels I've ever encountered in any genre.  I've read that Asimov considered it his best work, and I agree completely.  If you're not a science fiction fan, take two hours and read the second chapter alone, as a short story.  It will be well worth your time.work, and I agree completely.

B000VWE5OY|3.0|My children and I recently discovered the new Doctor Who programs and we were impressed by the intelligent scripts, the superior direction and sometimes outstanding acting.  This prompted me to order the anagram series Torchwood, billed as \\"a grownup sci-fi.\\"  Doctor Who lead writer Russell T Davies conceived Torchwood and wrote the initial episode, which seemed to be very promising.<br /><br />Alas, the reality fails to deliver on the promise.  The scripts don't provide us with a \\"way in\\" to the central characters and thus we never really come to care about them and their travails.  The challenges they face - aliens and other oddities crossing a temporal rift to invade Cardiff - are too simplistic and monotonic.  Some of the scripts struggle for relevance (for example, Meat, in which ordinary people are not for the last time the villains) but the single-episode story format is too confining.  Although Torchwood is supposed to be for adults, the scripts are actually much less intelligent than those for Doctor Who.  It's a shame, because the actors here are probably capable of much more, if only they had better material to work with.  Torchwood seems to be striving to be a less banal version of the X-Files but in the end doesn't rise to anything more than forgettable filler.<br /><br />Several reviewers have commented on the sexual aspects of the series but in reality there's very little sexuality on display, and that which is shown is just kissing and loving gazes.  Americans may get worked up over the same-sex stuff but let's face it: any for-adults European show is going to contain material that US citizens will find disturbing.  There's a huge cultural gap between Europeans and Americans and Torchwood reflects that, but it's not really integral to the show, any more than are the ringtones on their mobile (cellular) phones or the fact that despite all the high-tech stuff they don't seem to be able to get frame-mounted tactical lights and laser target acquisition devices for their handguns.<br /><br />In short, this is a series that could use a serious make-over in the scripting department, with a lot more emphasis on plot and character development.  If Doctor Who can assume that its audience of children is capable of following clues and subtle hints and can handle emotion to a considerable degree, why on earth would Torchwood miss out on precisely the things that made its parent series so compelling?  Davies clearly needs to return to the concept and beef it up, or the BBC should do the decent thing and opt for euthanasia.handguns.

B000AJIF4E|3.0|I am having the same problem that another reviewer on this site has had (and others elsewhere if you surf the web a little): Whenever I move my feet or shift in my seat, the headphones send a series of static shocks to my ears. This happens frequently. I have never had another pair of headphones do this. I called Sony and they said they would send me a replacement pair. I hope the replacement pair does not have this problem, because otherwise they sound very good and are comfortable and well-built, which is why I still give them three stars despite this unacceptable design flaw.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|I recently purchased this lovely movie for my 3-year-old son and it quickly became his favorite one. It does not matter how long ago it was made, Mary Poppins is a MUST HAVE in all homes with children and without children too, why not? It is simply fantastic and full of magic. We are Mexicans and I play it for him in Spanish and also in English, it is the best way for young ones to learn another language, it works for this purpose as well. Do not hesitate and get it!

1405853115|5.0|WANT A PRACTICAL LOOK INTO SOME METHODOLOGIES A TESOL/ESL TEACHER (in training) NEEDS TO BE AWARE OF?  Look no further than Jeremy Harmer's, 'The Practice of English Language Teaching'.      Arrived within two weeks of purchase (Over Christmas period), in terrific condition.  The text itself is very thorougher and Jeremy has a knack for explaining thoughts and concepts relevant to someone considering the teaching (Tesol/Tefl/Esl etc) field. Though I've only begun my TESOL certificate, I feel this text will help enormously, as this completely revised edition has the added bonus of discussion on such subjects as:  teacher development  learner autonomy &   context-sensitive learning & teaching methodologies    There is a wealth of up-to-date material any up-and-coming ESL teacher, or teacher in training, will find valuable as they complete their studies.

B001LRJH0U|4.0|I have to say, I have always been a fan of westerns. Honestly, the past few years have been mostly a hit or a miss; some are good, while others always come way short of instant western classics such as \\"Unforgiven\\" and \\"Tombstone\\". With the recent releases such as \\"3:10 To Yuma\\" and \\"The Assassination of Jesse James\\" in the U.S., even Asian filmmakers have gotten into the western bandwagon with \\"Sukiyaki Western Django\\" from Japan and \\" The Good, the Bad and the Weird\\" from Korea--seems like westerns are making a comeback. \\"APPALOOSA\\" is the most recent western entry based on a novel by Robert B. Parker and directed by Ed Harris who also plays the lead role along with a very stellar cast. Such a film demands attention, and \\"Appaloosa\\" doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />1882 in the U.S. Mexican territory, two hard cases named Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) have been summoned to Appaloosa because they get the job done and they are the best at what they do--they keep the peace even if it meant creating laws to do it. After the supposed disappearance of the previous town marshal and his two deputies, Cole and Hitch have been hired by desperate town leaders who sign over the town in a matter of minutes. The culprit is a wealthy rancher named Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons), who has his band of enforcers and who has been stirring up trouble in the small town. Cole and Hitch are set on a collision course with Bragg's band of hired guns, and to make things much more complicated for Cole, the arrival of Allison French (Renee Zellweger) and this enigmatic woman may be destined to change their lives forever.<br /><br />The film does have the usual elements of gunplay, friendship and camaraderie, but it also gives a quick look at sacrifice and the means to survive during these dangerous times. Thankfully, this is no sappy love triangle with Hitch, Cole and Allison, otherwise, I wouldn't waste my time. The film does serve up an effective study of the film's situation and harsh times. While much of it is expressed around Cole and Allison's relationship (or lack there of), the relationship between Hitch and Cole is also explored. The time of their partnership is unspecified, but it is a very long time, their partnership had become friendship. Randall Bragg may represent the ultimate opportunist and represents the unfairness of politics while the brothers Ring and Mackie Shelton (Lance Henriksen and Adam Nelson respectively) is the exact opposite of Hitch and Cole. All in all, these folks are doing what they can to survive.<br /><br />The film's pace is a little slow-moving and for a film with a 115 minute run time, it does feel longer. The direction does have a curiously episodic feel and seemed divided into 3 acts. But this is not a negative comment, since Harris' direction does manage to keep the screenplay interesting and the proceedings did flow nicely. The cinematography is quite impressive as the viewer is given quite a view of its western backdrop (shot mostly in New Mexico) and the costumes look pretty nifty and accurate. \\"Appaloosa\\" does feel like a contemporary western, that reveres its genre.<br /><br />While the film does carry the usual cowboy trappings, the characters are quite compelling. I think the lack of a solid background for its lead characters proved to be an advantage since it maintains some hints of an enigma and the viewer gets to know each one as the film goes along. Harris does manage to flesh them out in a methodical way to favor certain habits, peculiar to each character, that strengthens their actions and reactions, which promotes emotion and serves up characters that breath and their body language says a lot about them. There are also some nicely placed touches of humor with Cole's interactions, whenever he finds himself grasping for the right word.<br /><br />While the film does have its share of gunfights, which are shot realistically, there aren`t a lot of them. But to its credit, theyare nicely executed and kept me guessing as to who would survive that encounter. The film also manages to be a little unpredictable and the closing act does reinforce all the characteristics we've been privy to. It's a good credible pay off and it kept me on my toes, despite its somewhat slow-moving pace.<br /><br />The performances of its cast is real good and matches Harris` great direction.There is strong chemistry between Mortensen and Harris and they seem to be in familiar territory, they did have some practice working together in the film \\"A History of Violence\\" and the two has all the dynamics needed to pull it off. Renee Zellweger is an excellent actress although I have to admit this is not her best role to display her talents, but she does make the most out of what she's got on her plate. Irons is the bad guy and well...he's very bad. Our \\"heroes\\" wouldn't be much if weren't for a good villain. The actors are indeed the right people for the right job.<br /><br />The film's greatest strength is its simplicity and its respect for the western tradition is refreshingly cool. If you're expecting a \\"shoot-them-up\\" western then you're more than likely may become disappointed. However, it's slow-moving, but never dull screenplay does pay off and I think \\"Appaloosa\\" is a fine addition to the list of western films which stayed true to its traditions and style. Its simplicity is embodied in a tone that is very familiar to fans, realistic doses of violence with a warm, thought-provoking statement.<br /><br />Highly Recommended! [4 Stars]<br /><br />The Dvd does sport a great picture and sound quality. The picture is clean although there are some noise in some scenes especially in the dark scenes. The colors are a little muted but they look natural. The 5.1 Dolby Digital track is fitting for this type of film.g as to who would survive that encounter.

B00005R8GU|4.0|My friend Frank hates this album, but I think it sounds exactly like what it is...Muddy with a buncha younger kids who grew up listening to classic blues artists. Paul Butterfield (mouth harp) overplays a little (especially on the first track when he overdubs as well as plays along), but his chops are undeniable. If Mike Bloomfield had lived, people might not consider Eric Clapton the be-all and end-all guitarist. As a matter of fact, if they BOTH had lived on, they would be 60 year old blues men, like the Stones and have their OWN reputations to pass on. Sadly, they did not. The music here is spunky and feisty, leveling out all the mistakes made in past recordings. These guys know EXACTLY where they're going and must have been a real treat to see live, as the live tracks attest to. I'm so glad this part of Muddy's history was preserved for us now!

B000UJ48WC|5.0|We recently purchased a new 42\\" LCD HDTV and Blu-ray player and this was one of the first Blu-Ray's I purchased to view on our new system.  It is one of my husband's favorite movies so I purchased it as a surprise for him. It was so much better (and scarier) in Blu-ray than any of our previous viewings of this movie in other formats.  It felt like we were watching a great new movie for the first time; watching it in Blu-ray made that much of a difference!    As usual, I am completely pleased with Amazon's service, prices, and quick shipping.

While the Bonus CD offered a few much appreciated early Demos, they could have unearthed a few more, previously unavailable Studio Outtakes!  Having said this, I could not praise Picture, Sound and Presentation any higher - a guaranteed Winner for any GENESIS (PETER GABRIEL)-Fan or for any Music Lover that appreciates quintessential english PROGROCK!    Highly recommended, Nobby (The Record Collector)!
B000WQWPKA|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies, so when we bought a Blu-ray player in early December, I wanted a Blu-ray version of this movie.  I did price comparison research for a few days and the price on Amazon,(at the time I was searching and purchased it), was amazing in comparison to other places I searched. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because although the quality was great, it did not appear to be markedly improved in Blu-ray versus previous viewings in other formats.  Perhaps my expectations were too high?  Despite that, I am still glad I purchased it. Great movie, great price, great service and shipping from Amazon.

B001GKJ2F2|4.0|The widely seen preview of this movie has people flicking their arms and wrists around while firing a pistol, and causing a bullet to curve.  Many will question the physics of this, but somehow fail to mention the fact that a curve ball DOES curve ([[ASIN:0060084367 The Physics of Baseball (3rd Edition)]]).  With that in mind, just suspend disbelief a little and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a mild-mannered accountant who has the propensity for panic attacks.  When his hideous boss - think Lucille Ball mating with a sperm whale and ending up with Gilbert Gottfried's voice - gets on his case, he can hardly breathe.  His heart is in his throat, his pulse pounds, and he is the definition of a nervous wreck.  In a monotonous monologue, he makes it painfully clear that he despises his life.  While picking up his pills at the pharmacy, probably Zoloft, he meets the person who will twist his mind, body, and bullets: an assassin named Fox (Angelina Jolie - who did the same thing to Brad Pitt).  But first Fox has to get Gibson out of the pharmacy, which happens to be the same place another assassin, Cross (Thomas Kretschmann), is picking up some groceries.<br /><br />In a matter of no time he meets Sloan (Morgan Freeman), the head of \\"The Fraternity\\", an assassin association.  Soon he's training Neo-style, learning how to do other-wordly things like shooting wings off flies, and of course, the perpetual bullet curving.  McAvoy nails the character from beginning to end, almost opposite of Shia Lebouf's failure in [[ASIN:B000VR0570 Transformers]].  Every single actor turns in a great performance, but the action and special effects outshine them all.<br /><br />From beginning to end there is nearly unparalleled, surreal action - it rivals that of the Matrix series.  It's not really as deep as is supposed to be; it's basically adults with super powers.  Mixed in with some awesome gun play, great car scenes, and a fat Hispanic guy who handles knives better than Steven Seagal.

0316143472|4.0|This was my first Sedaris book and I purchased it mainly due to the reader comments.  Many people described it as observational humor and laugh-out-loud comical.  The book was certainly the type of observational humor I'm drawn to, but it wasn't near as funny as others proclaim.  The book was very interesting, in that the author's perspective of various events, even the mundane, was rather twisted.  It drew the occasional chuckle from me, especially the author's former New York neighbor.  I felt as though I missed out on something by not knowing this woman.  All in all, the various tales were written very well and flowed equally as well.  From what I understand, this was the author's fifth book or so, and I'll probably be reading a few of his others also.
0060575816|4.0|It took me several attempts before I finally managed to finish reading this book, and even then I'd read the first half of the book, then left it for a while, then returned to it. It's not that Sabriel isn't a good book, quite the contrary in fact, because the further you delve into the book, the more entertaining it becomes. It is just that at the beginning, there is so much information, strange words and confusing stories that I felt a little overwhelmed with my first read and left the book, only to return to it a few months later to see if I could make more sense of it.<br />The main problem with Sabriel (and the reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5) is that the beginning is just not encapturing enough. There was nothing encouraging me to read on, except the advice from my friends, who both said that this book was great. And it truly is, once you get further into it. I really begun to enjoy this book once Sabriel had found Touchstone (which was a little past the middle of the book) and thought that the remaining half of the story was great, interesting and full of twists and turns. Maybe it was because I finally got my head around the many confusing words and meanings used (such as necromancer, charter magic, or free magic - and i still don't fully understand what that is!!), but once I begun enjoying this book I found I didn't want to put it down, it was so interesting!<br /><br />The main story goes like this, 18 year old Sabriel, daughter of Abhorsen (a great necromancer who puts the dead to rest instead of bringing them back to life like the usual necromancer) is living happily in her colledge until one night she discovers that her dad has been taken into death and that it is up to her to rescue him. She travels to the old kingdom, past the great wall, makes new friends and loses old, and soon discovers that more than the life of her dad are at risk if she fails her task.<br /><br />Sabriel is a great book, full of magic, mystery, danger, and even a little love story is thrown in their. A great read once you get into it, buy it if you haven't got it, read it if you have.n their. A great read once you get into it, buy it if you haven't got it, read it if you have.
0316010669|4.0|Very intriguing book.  Examines not what we typically call first impressions, but the first moment or so of that first impression.  Provides numerous examples of how people's opinions are unconsciously formed in those first few seconds and how we should be aware of, and occasionally control those formations.  The only real downside is the book occasionally lacks a cohesiveness.  It is a collection of studies and events that the author attempts to pull together, and is somewhat tenuous at times.  But, overall, I really enjoyed the read.  One of the few books I've been able to sit down and really get into for hours on end.  I wouldn't surprised if there are others out there who finished the book in just a few sittings as I did.
630587493X|5.0|Personally, I thought this film was brill!<br />When I first saw it a few years back I admit that I didn't like it much, it seemed rather stupid to think that a robot could 'become' human, but on viewing it again years later, I can safely say that I missed the whole point of this film.<br /><br />Andrew is a robot to begin with, but one with feelings and the ability to learn. He wants to learn, wants to talk, wants to create, and through some mistake when he was being created he can. His unique ability, mixed with his owners kindness and help allow him to grow up like a real human, by learning, having memories, caring about his family etc.<br /><br />This film shows Andrew's aim to become human, and follows his life from when he first became the 'machine' of the Martin family, to when he finally fell in love with their youngest daughters grand child, and becomes human to die beside her on tehir death beds.<br /><br />It is a sad movie, with a few tear jerking parts (especailly at the end) and it asks alot of questions which we don't often think about, like can robots have feelings, can they love, and can they become human? In the end, what does defy whether you are a human or not, is it being born with the right, or can you earn the title.<br /><br />This is a definate 5 for me. true, it is a very long film and the start can drag on a bit, but it is a beautiful tale that I beleive everyone should watch atleast once.
B001KVZ6FC|4.0|Clint Eastwood in his late seventies has the title role in this film, and he more than makes the most of it.   Anyone who saw \\"Tightrope\\" years ago knows the man can act, and he's even better here than he was then.   His Walt Kowalski is a man embittered by his armed service in Korea, his wife dying, his lack of real communication with his children, his neighborhood's erosion from all white to people of color...in short, there's nothing he ISN'T embittered about.   It would be very easy to dislike or even hate Walt, but that's the beauty of Eastwood: he makes you understand and empathize with Walt, even while being appalled at his insensitivity.   Other reviewers have gone into the plot, so I won't here.   The performances are all strong, but the one that especially stood out in my opinion was the priest.   The priest was a difficult role, because he keeps popping up like an overanxious car salesman--- simply because he promised Walt's wife to do something and he keeps trying to do it, while Walt just as determinedly keeps resisting it.   The casting was superb.   The actor looks like a young Spencer Tracy and  more than held his own against Eastwood's crusty curmudgeon.         The only thing I really had a problem with was the ending.   The entire film sets you up emotionally for a certain finale, and then goes in a totally unexpected different direction.   Without giving anything away, I found it difficult to believe that Walt would intentionally do what he did.   Was the doctor visit supposed to be what pushed him over the edge?   Was he just tired?    Did he just stop caring, or what?   It seemed to me that a man who spent his whole life emotionally shutting down would not suddenly change at the last minute.   But aside from that, I thought it was a hell of a movie.

It should be removed as a stand-alone product, even if it is free.  Otherwise, every book would be listed this way, cluttering the lists further. I won't buy the full book on principle.
B000MRA5EM|4.0|Deep Sea IMAX is a short (around 40 minutes) but very satisfying documentary about life in the ocean. The footage is top notch and it is enhanced by the familiar voices of Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet.<br /><br />Adults who are real ocean fanatics may find this movie to be a little wanting due to the short duration. But I purchased this for my three year old daughter who loved a copy that I had rented last summer. In general I think that shorter movies are better for kids because their attention spans are shorter.<br /><br />One of my friends commented that he thought the term \\"deep\\" was a bit of false advertising because while the film is definitely shot in deep water they don't explore the really dark and mysterious places at the very bottom of the ocean. This assessment is true enough. So if you're into really deep ocean videos then this may not be the one for you.
0312323867|5.0|This was the perfect contiutation to something borrowed.  I'm not going into any detail because I do not want to ruin it for those who have yet to read either or both books.  Howeve, I will say that for this genre they are must reads and you are guarenteed to be satisfied with your purchase.
B0000DJZA0|2.0|For the sake of avoiding getting this review tagged as unhelpful, my comments are geared specifically towards \\"audiophile\\"-types who are very concerned with the quality of sound reproduction. If that isn't your thing, feel free to ignore my comments.    I really enjoy Coldplay, but the sound quality here is unforgivable. I couldn't bring myself to listen to much of it on my high-end system. For Coldplay fans who are also audio freaks, this album is not for you.
0671015206|5.0|The Millionaire next door is a startling peek into the frugal lives of America's Millionaires.  A motivating reminder of the power of the proven success of frugality!  Must read!
B0010YPTGU|5.0|Bocelli is indescribable.  His voice alone is worth the price of the DVD but he brings in guests to share the stage with him that are stand alone stars in their own right.  All in all, it is just superb and it will move you to tears at points.  Enjoy! A+
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I bought this for myself for Xmas, still unopened but its in tact plus Amazon has never disappointed me yet also it is brand new..I also bought the Sex in the city movie which is awesome..I just wanted to have the complete series to reflect back on on cold winter nights..Enjoy
B001F12J3Y|4.0|Excellent Product,However I thought the 3-D would have better colors since it is on Blu-Ray(More like the movie theatre).
B000XSWVEC|4.0|As a music teacher and a marching band percussion director,  I found this movie very inspiring. It gives an idea of what it is to be part of a drum corps. My high school students are not treated the same way but I was glad to offer a different prospective of being a percussionist in some colleges. It is very inspiring, very entertaining...
0743290119|1.0|The book was missing approximately 50 pages...went from pg 122 back to pg 59. Borders was willing to take the book back. I was dissapointed b/c it was a gift for our daughter in law. It causes hesitation for me about ordering material such as this from amazon. Amazon's policy is only 7 days...which does NOT allow time for Christmas gifts, etc.  Perhaps you should revisit that policy.
0312383320|1.0|Could not even finish this. Thank goodness it was a library copy.  I cannot take the repetition in her novels any longer.    No more Evanovich books for me.
0307269191|5.0|I have read a few of Murakami's novels. While I enjoyed them as a whole, at times I had trouble discerning exactly how I was taking the meaning or relationships in them. So, with this book I had some preset expectations. I expected to read a novel of a complex man, who struggles with the eccentricities of human nature, but found a warm recount of a man trying to live the best life he knows how.     Murakami touches on his past, his come up, and how he personal strove to be a different person and change his life. Much of the message came shining through to me as a story of perseverance. While life did not give him a free pass, it was not a trek down the mean streets either. He adeptly covers how we can find our calling (even later in life), and if we diligently work towards it, can achieve a sort of contentment. In the story we call \\"life\\", I'm not sure what more can be asked for.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|This film is on the top of my list for the year; in fact, it would stand a good chance at being on the top of my list for any year.  It is entertaining but also has something to say about human nature.  Batman and Joker are great antithetical characters representing the best and worst in humanity.  Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is a landmark in cinema history and a must see for even the casual fan of film.  I highly recommend this film.
159448385X|4.0|This book was very well written.  It took me awhile to get into reading the story but once I did I couldn't put it down.  It was disturbing and enlightening all at the same time.  I would recommend this to my friends.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD is worth the money. There are 3 20minute workoust on it. Don't think b/c its 20minutes its not a workout. There are no breaks and you will be tired. Its a great workout.
B000N0W9WO|4.0|This really is two stories in one. In the first story you have a love quadrangle with Iris, played by Kate Winslet hopelessly in love with a Jasper, played by Rufus Sewell, you keeps leading her on but doesn't love her, and then there's Jack Black's character Miles who meets her and though dating someone else who likewise doesn't feel the same for him, he falls for Iris. Are you confused yet?  Don't be, it's not nearly confusing as it sounds. Though it makes you feel sorry for the characters. Along the way Iris befriends a neighbor who is a writer from old Hollywood. That might be the best part of her story. It was for me at least, though Jack Black gives us a few laughs.<br /><br />Then the other story is about Amanda, played by Cameron Diaz. She switches homes with Kate's character and that's where the real comedy is. She left LA to get away from an ex-boyfriend (Yes, there's lots of heartache early on). Then she meets Graham, played by Jude Law, who is Iris's brother. I enjoyed their story the best. It was funny and sweet and you really get to like Graham once you get to know him and his situation.<br /><br />Overall this is more of a romance than a comedy, but it's a good story, or I mean stories, and in the end the two stories come together in a cute way.
1591841984|1.0|Author is praising and REPEATING the same few points again and again... nothing close to Steve's brain.  Problem is- he (author) is not technical enough. He's a typical 'nothings better than apple' guy who would not give any credit to other products or companies.   Attractive title, but mostly boring book.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|I bought this CD for my niece for Christmas.  I was disappointed that it came in the mail damaged.  There was no time to return it before the holidays.  I must say though...Christmas was on Thursday and I returned it on Friday and had a new CD my Monday....Way to go Amazon...the service was outstanding!
006107327X|5.0|The book FEATURES character designs , storyboards, layouts, animation samples of the production process of the animated series. It is very informative and educational for anyone interested in learning  animation.  Also if you are a fan of batman the animated series, you must own this book.  I wish there were more books dedicated to other series like justice league unlimited,superman, batman beyond (although it has some brief designs since Batman beyond was very early at the time this book was made)
0141439475|5.0|Frankenstein conjures us lurid images of Boris Karloff in the best Hollywood version of the tale, However, the classic novel by Mary Shelley<br />(1797-1851) is better than any movie version! She composed it while on holiday near Lake Geneva. She, her Romantic poet husband Percy Bysshe and their friend Lord George Byron challenged one another to compose a horror story. Mary's dream of 1818 became the novel we now know as Frankenstein.<br />  it tells the story of scientific genius Victor Frankenstein and the unnamed man he creates using galvanism and electricity in a horrible corpse. The creature becomes a murderer escaping from Victor. The creature murders Victor's wife, best friend, brother. Victor begins a quest to destroy his own creation but die in mortal combat with the horror in the icy wastes of the barren North Pole.<br /> Victor had earlier refused his creatioin's desire for the scientist to conjure up a Mrs. Frankenstein. Victor worried that the two monsters would create a race of horrible creatures who would wage war on humanity.<br />  The beginning and ending of the novel are written in an epistolary correspondence carried on by sea captain Walton and his sister back home in England. They narrate the strange and sad tale. Though almost 200 years old the prose is quite readable. The Penguin edition footnotes add insight to the novel.<br />  Mary's subtitle was \\"The Modern Prometheus.\\" Prometheus was the Greek god who stole fire from the gods giving it to mankind. As a punishment the gods imprisoned him to a rock. Prometheus (Frankenstein) may represent modern industrial society, rebellion or chaotic forces unleashed my humanity. One thinks of the Frankenstein-like atomic bomb era precipitating the Cold.<br />  Mary Shelley was well read and drew upon her expertise in gothic horror, ghost story and adventure tales to complete her little gem of a classic. Her book is well written, thought provoking and deeply disturbing. It is a parable of the modern age of angst, fear and chaos we all inhabit each day on our conflicted globe.chaos we all inhabit each day on our conflicted globe.
031606792X|5.0|[[ASIN:031606792X Breaking Dawn (The Twilight Saga, Book 4)]]  The Twilight series just keeps getting better! Breaking Dawn was superb, the best yet. This book kept me captivated through its entirety, full of surprises the whole way. I hope Stephanie Meyer doesn't stop with this one.
B000BSNPR6|4.0|Great to see many of my favourite songs performed live and with such effect.  Also includes the music videos to 3 of their songs, their 'Angels' and 'Memories' like mini movies.  Some of the Bloopers just consisted of giggling for what seemed like a long time but also included footage of one band member saving another from an on stage effect - awesome.  Overall a great DVD that is going to get a lot of play in my household.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|I have been meaning to purchase this video for several years, but finally did it this year.  It is a classic!  Reminds all of us of the stingy boss, and the derelict relatives we all have known, whether our own or someone elses!  This is a must see during the holidays!
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Lost season 4 is one of the best seasons of the show !!!! [[ASIN:B0018CWEYY Lost: The Complete Fourth Season]]
B000WGWQG8|4.0|Giamatti brought his A game to this ambitious production and was supported by an equally impressive cast. By McCullough's account Adams was a strong but complex character.  The series does successfully show that the founding fathers were all different but came together for one common cause.  It's weird that his refusal to go to war with France likely cost him a second term and then when you compare that with the USA's recent history.  My only complaint was that most of the time jumps were a bit jarring.  Laura Linney also turned in one of her best performances.  I literally had tears in my eyes during her death scene.  Bravo.  Overall, this is definitely a series worth watching.
0307346617|5.0|Well integrated from it's predecessor, World War Z paints a human picture of hope and inspiration on a time of absolute horror. Kudos to Max Brooks for a new spin on an old tale. I can't wait for the motion picture!
0316017922|5.0|This highly lucid book is a milestone in the general discussion of the nature and origins of success, and, I would argue, the importance of environment and the resulting variables that influence human development and progress.  Educators and politicians should be first in line to read this book.  Gladwell always does careful and thorough research, but this book may be the most important of the ones he has written to date. (Next in line is The Tipping Point.)  There is room here for a great deal more discussion and thinking, but Mr. Gladwell does superior work in getting the discussion off the ground.  Easily one of the most important books of the last 10 years, imho.
B001G1ACVY|4.0|I enjoyed these CD's very much and would consider the music quirky, and melodic.  I am not a young person, but stil enjoyed this modern music from Jason Mraz.
B00168OINK|4.0|This blu-ray video freezes in 3 places and then jumps ahead a bit and continues to play from there. 3 of the Blu-ray movies we purchased for Christmas from Amazon do the same thing.
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|I had to get this DVD since I'm visible, for a second, in the third row of the \\"Atlanta bootleg\\" disc. It was a fantastic show in person, and on DVD! I've seen a lot of concert videos in my time, but the quality of this one ranks up with the best...plus it's Rush!!!!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Based on David McCullough's excellent biography, the HBO miniseries does not disappoint.  It is thorough and dramatic, with wonderful performances and terrific writing.  Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney are outstanding as John and Abigail Adams, and the supporting cast is great as well.  This is a must for history buffs, as well as for those who don't really know much about the founding of our country and/or John Adams himself.
1400049628|5.0|Well written and fully entertaining. Everything you need to know to make it through the coming zompacalypse.
B000I0QK74|5.0|Don't have any James Taylor music, but I'm from his \\"generation\\" and I like his music.  I especially love Christmas music and this is an excellent CD.  I've never liked \\"Go, Tell It On The Mountain\\", but I really like James' rendition.  Probably one of the reasons why I bought this CD.  I highly recommend this CD if you like Christmas music, and especially if you're a James Taylor fan.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|An excellent series; well acted and thoughtfully written.  If you hated history growing up this series will change your outlook on it.  Costuming and make-up also outstanding.  All around a valuable purchase.
B00000C28M|4.0|As an unabashed admirer of both Gould and Bernstein, it pains me not to give this recording 5 stars; however, the audience noise (coughing) destroys what should have been a thought provoking recording. Is there no recording technology to remove or at least subdue audience noise?
0446581348|5.0|This purchase of the Bobbi Brown Makeup Manual has been wonderful. I can say that it was worth my time and Money to get this product. I have greatlty enjoyed it. The shipping was wonderful as well, fast with no damages! Thanks bunches!
B001J1O848|4.0|The most succinct way to describe this Luc Besson scripted revenge flick starring Liam Neeson is to picture what would happen if Jason Bourne retired and had his daughter kidnapped in Paris. However, this film is a revenge film and not a spy thriller, so don't go looking for any heavy character development or government mysteries. Nor does this film  have a Bourne-sized budget, and some of the \\"bigger\\" action scenes suffer for it.    What this film does have is Liam Neeson as a one man dispenser of asskickery who pistolwhips and throat chops more bad guys in one scene than Damon did in all the Bourne films combined. Maggie Grace (Remember her from seasons 1 & 2 of LOST?) does an amicable job as the daughter in distress, but the main attraction for action fans is seeing in what way Neeson's PO'd poppa is going to exact his brand of justice next.
6305558167|5.0|Excellent DVD!!  I've enjoyed Escalibur for years and was glad to finally find it on DVD.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|I got this as a present for my father. He really enjoyed watching the movie, and thought it was great in blue ray!
B001GZ6QDS|3.0|Though not the best movie of all times this is definitely one of the best ones of the last few years. Christian Bale's mediocre acting is fully made up for by Heath Ledger's already legendary interpretation of the Joker.     But this review should be about the DVD set not about the movie since you can get enough information on that on the net anyway.    The steelbook special edition of Batman Begins was definitely a must if you are only mildly interested in how movies are made and how much in spite of all the great things you can do digitally is still done 'practical' (may be the other way round for some directors). The second DVD on that version was packed with special features, behind-the-scene stuff and all in all worth the purchase.    In the case of The Dark Knight 2 disc SE I can't really say that. There's not a lot of information on there that would really justify the price (or purchase in the first place). The information you get on the Bat Pod is good, and so is the description of the redesign of the Bat Suit. But I would have liked some further information on the hospital scene, stunts, studio/on location work, director's commentary etc. Instead they packed the sequences that were shot on IMax onto the disc - in their original aspect ratio (but of course only 1/8th of the resolution). Something that doesn't make any sense at all but only wastes space that could have been used to put some real bonus material on there.    My conclusion: Watch and enjoy the movie but don't expect too much from this edition.
0805047905|5.0|I am a kindergarten teacher.  Students who are just learning to read can \\"read\\" this back to the class due to the simple repetitive text.  This encourages the student to learn to read the words.<br /><br />I use this to teach basic sign language of colors and animals. I can add a video review and show how to do this if anyone is interested. But, you can type in keywords of sign language & learning and see how simple it is to teach the basic colors in ASL.  Give it a try.
031606792X|5.0|I purchased two copies of Breaking Dawn to complete the series given to my thirthteen and fifthteen year old granddaughters.  This was part of their Christmas gift request.  Neither of the girls have started reading Breaking Dawn, as they are still reading the second and third book.  But, if this book is anything like the other three, they will get a great deal of reading pleasure from it too.
B000KJT8IG|1.0|I LOVE this movie! It's my favorite Christmas movie!    We got a Blu-ray for Christmas, and I wanted \\"Christmas Vacation\\" to be one of the first Blu-ray movies I got for our collection.    I ordered it through Amazon, got it quickly, and, alas, the words and the actors' mouths are not in sync.    This bothered me greatly, so, I returned it to Amazon, and they sent me another movie.    And, this one is doing the same thing.    So, I'm assuming all are like this.    Otherwise, the movie is so funny and a great Christmas adventure because we all can see ourselves in the situations presented in the movie.
B000VI6T6K|4.0|LIVE AT MONTEREY and the BAND OF GYPSIES are the best Jimi Hendrix albums ever recorded . Live At Monterey captures jimi after he broke out as a sensation in the U.K. and he was poised to become the legend in America he became . This was the show of shows on CD and DVD . Rock Me Baby , Like A Rolling Stone , Killing Floor all one of a kind with the best version of Hey Joe and his other songs I've ever heard . He was on top ,in charge and on fire that night and the sound crew captured it beautifully .
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I used to have the Muppets Christmas Carol on VHS.  I watch it every year and decided to track it down on DVD to continue my tradition.  Anyone with children will enjoy this human/muppet mix of the classic tale.
B000P12LWY|5.0|Tudors is an amazing tv series. you have to be interested in these type of series to appreciate tudors. My husband and I love these series!
076781326X|5.0|I enjoyed this movie when I was a child and it was great to be able to find this movie at your website and enjoy it again with my mother.
1423113497|4.0|I have been looiking for a Harry Potter replacement and tried many of the series, and I liked this one best.  Likeable characters, interesting situtations, and you learn a little mythology along the way. The set is almost as inexpensive as one book.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Seen this movie on IMAX, the Blu-ray version just as good. Definately recommend watching it on 1080p.     Great experience all around.
B000IOM0WE|4.0|This is a good movie and I own it both on blue ray and standard dvd format. I Like the speacial effects, sort film but well worth it!!!!
B001GKJ2DY|2.0|MAMMA MIA! has got to be one of the worst movies ever made.  I thought that HELLO, DOLLY! was the worst Broadway to Hollywood transfer ever done but this edges it out.  I haven't seen the Broadway show but it has to be better than this to have run 8 years on Broadway (and still going!).  This movie was stupid, silly, and painful to watch.  The scenery was nice but who spends this kind of money to make a movie and then not hire any professional singers and not dub the singing voices?  OK, Christine Baranski is a Broadway vet .. but she doesn't get to sing as much as Meryl Streep (who at least tries but looks particular silly and out of place, especially using her bed like a trampoline)and Pierce Brosnan ... PIERCE BROSNAN?  It was actually painful to watch him belting out a number of tunes.  He can't sing. He can't even pretend to sing ... so \\"sing\\" softly .. don't scream it out to bring the point home that you are TERRIBLE.  I couldn't believe how bad this movie is from beginning to end.  Why does everyone \\"love\\" it, as the ads say?
6304493681|5.0|This is one of the best anamie series i have ever seen. Highly recommend to all fans of sci-fi or anamie.
B0000542D2|5.0|I could not be happier buying through Amazon. The product was shipped quickly and the price was great. From now on i will buy through Amazon if they have the product i am looking for.
B001GQACGE|3.0|First let me say that I believe that Beyonce is a gifted artist and one of the best singers of my generation. With that said, I think that this project falls far below what she is capable of. The legend is that she recorded her last CD, \\"B-Day\\" in one weekend and if that's true, then it sounds as if this was compiled in a day. There are a few great tracks, but overall I think the CD falls short.<br /><br />The most frustrating aspect is the format. Why did we need two separate CDs for 10-12 songs (it varies depending on which edition you purchase)? I understand the marketing gimmick - Beyonce vs. Sasha, I get it. But would not a simple interlude have sufficed? Why should one artist occupy two of the precious few spots in my CD changer? Further, the Beyonce disc is full of slow power ballads and gets very boring after track 3. The Sasha disc is more upbeat, but there's nothing new or original here - these are clones of Get Me Bodied, Upgrade U, etc. It's almost as if she took the songs that didn't make the cut for her previous projects and compiled them here. I'm not impressed.<br /><br />The best cuts on this CD are If I Were a Boy, Halo, Diva, Video Phone and Single Ladies but I'm sure you'll be hearing more than enough of these on the radio in the coming months. A mediocre effort from an exceptional artist.
6304698690|2.0|This item is being returned.  It was a gift, and they said that it would freeze up so wouldn't play.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|The two disc special edition is more than worth the extra cost, loved the movie plus all the extra stuff. Shipping and handling was smooth. Thumbs up guys!
0545128285|3.0|The delivery of the book was on time and the content was as great as I had hoped. However, I would have been much happier if the spine wasn't so bent on both the top and the bottom. I knew my boyfriend was a collector, so I wasn't thrilled to give him a somewhat battered looking book. Luckily, my little sister got the same book for Christmas and she exchanged with me. My only thing about buying it here is that if you are planning to give it to someone, or you are a collector DON'T buy it through amazon. I don't think it's the packaging... I blame the travel.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|My husband and I love this series. It picks up where it left off in Season 3 and even had an eight minute fifteen second update from the previous seasons.
B001HVZO9S|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Drumline should only be of interest to those who want to hear some cool drum music, for otherwise the formulaic plot and laughable moments (he just played on the other side's drum! OMG major breach of etiquette!) will make the movie a chore to watch.
1401207529|5.0|Unlike many other superheros in the DC Universe, when the great origin revamp of the 1980s started, they left Batman's origin story well enough alone. It did, however, need to be retold. So to write the alpha, DC turned to the man who so masterfully told Batman's omega in \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\": Frank Miller.<br /><br />We all know how Bruce Wayne's parents were slain, and Miller doesn't insult our intelligence and gives us a quick recap. Most of Year One is spent covering the rookie Batman and Lieutenant Jim Gordon, who's just taken a job in Gotham. Several important characters have cameos - Harvey Dent and Catwoman, for example - but the story really is about Batman and Gordon forging their bond.<br /><br />Year One is a masterful Batman story. Not as dystopian as \\"The Dark Knight Returns,\\" the warmer color palette and more optimistic end reflect the hope of Batman as he started out. A must-read for any Batman fan.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I had seen this dvd advertised on Amazon UK and was hoping some channel would pick it up for US broadcast (Thank you, Ovation!!!). Jemima Rooper and Elliot Cowan had perfect chemistry, and the rest of the cast was just as wonderful. It's a must-see for any Austen fan, especially those who loved the P&P version with Colin Firth. There's a brilliant homage to it in one particular scene, which I didn't expect and just blew me away!<br /><br />Also, you can catch the deleted scene where Amanda sings \\"Downtown\\" on YouTube, as well 5 behind the scenes clips. I read on the Amazon UK reviews that the \\"Downtown\\" scene was deleted from the UK dvd version as well, probably due to copyright issues.
B000026C3T|5.0|I have owned pretty much every album Led Zeppelin has released, and this is the one I carry with me all the time. It is a perfect combination of some of their greatest hits. Love it!
B000OY8NII|5.0|LOVE THIS PROGRAM,  ONLY SCI-FI CHANNEL HAS THE GUTS TO SHOW A PROGRAM THAT IS AS DIFFERENT AS THIS PROGRAM IS.   IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS SERIES, WATCH THE FIRST ONE AND YOU WILL BE HOOKED.  ENJOY IT.
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|The Bottom Line:    All of Brick's pieces may not fit together when the story is done, but the movie is a fascinating attempt to fit a noir detective story into a High School and far more interesting than most teen movies: give it a shot.
1401216676|5.0|Take one of the most compelling villains of all time - the Joker - and one of the undisputed gods of the comics world - Alan Moore - and put them together: you get one giant piece of awesome.<br /><br />Brian Bolland went back and redid the colors for this edition, which make the exemplary artwork stand out even more. Alternating between an origin story and an unforgettable confrontation between the Dark Knight and the Clown Prince of crime that shows both how utterly alone they are (think the interrogation scene in the movie \\"The Dark Knight\\" but friendlier), \\"The Killing Joke\\" pulls you in and never lets go, leaving you with a satisfying but inexplicably (but purposefully) troubling ending.<br /><br />This deluxe edition also contains an original graphical afterword by Bolland, which is a nice extra but ultimately forgettable. \\"The Killing Joke\\" may be two decades old but is no less a classic now as it was then.
B000X5KSWM|2.0|My Winter Storm is nothing more than a vocal extravaganza. There is no musical creativity whatsoever. The songwriting is average at best. I never thought of Tarja as anything special as a singer. In Nightwish her vocal screw ups were covered up by the music, but here all of her limitation are right in the open. This is just another uninspiring album among the many and with its release Tarja became a pop singer who keeps making awful covers. Smell Like Teen Spirit was bad enough, but she also had to do Poison.      I hope MWS is just an experimentation and Tarja's next album will be a more solid work.
B00000DGUG|2.0|I am a pretty big fan of Alanis. I own four albums in addition to this one, and have to say that this is definitely my least favorite. I bought the CD because it has the song 'That I Would be Good' on it, and after listening to it, I feel that is the only good song on it.
0140120416|4.0|The New Penguin Russian Course: A Complete Course for Beginners (Penguin Handbooks)   This is a good CD set to get started jumping in and pronouncing Russian words and assembling sentances. Unfortunately for us, we damaged the CD and can't get past track 6 of the 1st disk. :o(   Other than that it is good for picking up some conversational Russian. Next we need to get the \\"Beginners\\" Set then learn to read basic signs.
B00009Y3L4|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Cabaret is a musical for people who don't like them--none of the songs stain the viewer's disbelief (as they all occur in natural settings for songs), the historical context is very interesting, and the acting (particularly by Joel Grey) is great; the movie suffers a bit because the Cabaret scenes are much more interesting than the central romance, but it's a very good movie nonetheless.
0525951113|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a while.  The premise is interesting, gets its technical facts straight, and the ending is just the right mix of payoff, twist, and cliffhanger.      The plot is tight - everything hangs together nicely and there's a blessed lack of pointless page-filler found in so many of today's novels.  The twists avoid being predictably unpredictable.  Some are jaw droppers.    The characters are real people who act in mature and rational (for them) ways; no teen angst here.    Best of all, this is not another story about the battle between good and evil, or the end of the world, or of a malevolent \\"ghost in the machine\\" (although, you might be tempted to think so at first).  This is one of those rare finds - a truly original tale well told.
B00009ZYC1|5.0|One of the best movies ever made.  Our family owns all three releases - makes for a great evening, rather than watching something not intended for children on TV.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I will say that the music is phenominal. The DVD quailty is from the mid 90's. Still it is a good recording. The productions by Pink Floyd always ceases to amaze me. Their stage was something out of your dreams. All in all if you like Pink Floyd this is a must have DVD.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I became aware of this movie through my first-grader's reading class.  She couldn't stop talking about it, so I spoke with her teacher and got the same results.  I ordered the DVD for Christmas 08, and it has been seen at least 20 times so far.  The message is excellent for both child and adult, from character depiction, excellent life lessons, photography, special effects, production, and good positive events.  It remains as one of the very best movies I have seen in my lifetime and I heartily recomment it to everyone; it truly is an uplifting event.  If you don't buy it at least rent it and enjoy a truly excellent event in life without the violence, vulgarity, profanity, and sexual references so prevelent today.
B00005O3VC|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Romanced all out of proportion, Monty Python and the Holy Grail has its funny and effective moments but quickly runs out of steam and creativity; many people like it but it's certainly no great movie.
B001DCQI8W|5.0|I cannot agree with the previous reviewer's assessment that these recordings are in \\"wondrously spatial, clear\\" sound. Karajan's Bruckner cycle is badly in need of remastering. The original digital transfer remains the only one available, and it's badly outdated. It suffers from ovoerload in loud passages and digital shrillness in the uppper strings.<br /><br />I have done quite a few A-B comparisons to other Karajan Bruckner recordings, and all have better sonics except the 1966 Sym. 9 on DG Galleria. The EMI Fourth and Seventh have considerably better sound than the versions in this box set, thanks to extensive remastering. The very late Seventh and Eighth from Vienna are also miles better. An early Eighth on EMI is worse, suffering from boxy early stereo.  A mono Eighth from Vienna, included in an expesnive compilation from Andante, is good of its kind but inferior to all the stereo versions of the Eighth that came later.
B001KL3GWM|5.0|I have not been a Derek Trucks fan before today. I saw him with the Allman Brothers on TV a couple of years ago ( I was a huge Allman Bros fan in college) and was impressed but didn't follow up on his own recordings. Then I heard this CD and I have to admit I have not been this excited about a rock / soul recording in a long, long time! It just feels good to listen to. I love the soulful feel and the up and down slide of exciting rhythm and then mellow tunes. I am not a rock afficianado and can't really describe well what I love about it. I usually go for the more mellow and folky type of music -- or classical. But I can't sit still with this recording -- and I am a very sedate over 50's woman! I highly recommend this CD and the new Susan Tedeschi CD, 'Back to the River' as well.
B000N6TYLW|1.0|I have purchased all seven seasons of Gilmore Girls through Amazon. I have been perfectly happy with prices, service, shipping etc. On this seventh season disc 6 it came with a huge scratch. It was a Christmas gift and we wanted to watch all the discs, so we have tried to watch it several times but it skips too much... :(
B000093FLA|5.0|The Bottom Line:    The acme of Guy Ritchie's creativity (and likely his career), Snatch is well-written, clever, and unending fun; the intentionally convoluted screenplay folds back upon itself ingeniously and ends on a perfect note for this almost perfect crime film.
0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is a great novel. Its been on my to read list for quite some time. My bookclub wanted to read it for our monthly book so I got the opportunity to read it.<br /><br />Its set in WW2 during the Germany Nazi days. However its from a child's perspective so it doesn't mention anything about the concentration camps and it's not a graphic book.
B000002IWH|5.0|Fast service even during Xmas holiday. Very happy and would do business with them again.
B00005UW9T|4.0|The Bottom Line:    As long as you don't mistake Anastasia for anything close to history, you'll probably enjoy this well-made animated movie for its above-average music, characters, and story.
8492429399|5.0|Compre este libro para mi hijo de 13 a&ntilde;os. Ya leyo el primero y segundo y esperaba con ansias el tercero. Yo no lo he leido, pero puedo decir que el lo esta leyendo sin parar. Por lo que me imagino que ha de estar muy interesante !
B000KN7BIQ|1.0|did not realize the format was blue ray and have not been able to use or even give it away
B001ED7C58|5.0|Wonderful mix of rock music. Every song if solid. Includes two Paramore songs and Bella's Lullaby.
B00011D1OA|3.0|The Bottom Line:    My Fair Lady is overlong, with far too much attention paid to characters who don't merit it (Freddy being a great example) and simply pad the running length; at its core there's an enjoyable story with Eliza and Henry Higgins, but the film is too bloated and slow to make it a classic.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|For ardent fans of Celine, this is a terrific video.  Especially those who prefer to see and feel the level of artistry present in \\"live\\" performances.  [[ASIN:B000Y7ZHCU Live In Las Vegas- A New Day..]]
B001HQZJP2|5.0|The Third movie feels like a rehash of the prior two, albeit in China, but the special effects are good throughout and it is a feast for the eyes. My own suggestion is to rent the first movie in BD as a priority, determine if you enjoy the plot line and if you do, purchase the Trilogy.
0783227434|5.0|This is a non-thinking movie.  Just watch and listen and be entertained, especially through the cemetary scene. Bruce Campbell is a hoot!
B0007Y08QA|4.0|The Bottom Line:    The central mystery to the movie is a bit of an old hat, but Bale is terrific, the direction is taut, and the sense of gloom which pervades the film is so oppressive and profound that The Machinist ends up making a deep impression.
B00003CXB2|5.0|I had wanted this movie for quite some time. I was very happy with the packaging & with the first rate service that Amazon always has. Now for the movie. This reminds you of how movies should be made and makes you long for those days again. The beauty of the desert is shown in its glory. If you haven't seen this movie yet what are you waiting for? The Oscars were well deserved....5 Stars because I can't give 10.
0321543726|5.0|You know how you read some books and you are dead sure they'll end up in the \\"New and Used\\" section here for four or five dollars in a few years?<br /><br />This is one that I think will be holding its value for many years - if the publishers ever let it go  out of print the used copies will probably sell for more than it did new!<br /><br />As the first reviewer noted, Bjarne is really teaching programming and using C++ to do it.  Not only that: he's teaching programming superbly, with style, humor, intelligence and grace.<br /><br />If you are already a C++ programmer, you don't need this, but you might just buy it anyway: it's that good!

B000RW3VD4|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Wall Street wastes Daryl Hannah but makes up for it with a magnetic Michael Douglas in the lead; it's not one of Oliver Stone's best but it's effective and enjoyable enough.
1577314808|5.0|This book is essentially what everyone needs to read at some point in their life. It sheds light on the truths that many people overlook.
B001PPLIEQ|2.0|This movie was as close to a waste of time as a Bond movie can get. The action sequences are so busy and disjointed you can't follow what's going on, who's doing what to whom. Forster has taken the jerky action cam thing to the ugly extreme. It's not even coherent enough to make you dizzy...you just sit there completely clueless as to what's going on.    What's more, I'm just not down with the whole Bond as a \\"blunt instrument\\" thing these last two movies are promoting. That is not Bond. Bond is a suave, subtle, nuanced instrument who uses brains and ingenuity, and when all else fails, cool, gee-whiz gadgets...always the polished gentleman, and the ultimate ladies man (one look and they swoon). Daniel Craig is none of those things. I didn't like him as a choice when he was first announced, but decided to withhold judgment. But after two films I'm decided: he's not Bond. Bring on Clive Owen![[ASIN:B0014DZ2VO Quantum of Solace [Theatrical Release]]]
0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell is 3 for 3 with another great publication. The book is easy to read, insightful, and useful for professionals of any field.

He laughs out loud all day. i myself also read one of the books and it was great. not only was it good for my son, it was good for me too.Also it was delivered 4 days earlier than the due date so i was very happy.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|This is the first blue ray dvd set I have bought.  I do not regret it one bit.  The video and audio quality is great.  It truly is a comprehensive documentary of the wildlife on our planet.  My only complaint is that the case was broken on deliver.  The one of the tabs for the center divider had broken as well as one of the center tabs for the dvd.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|A great family movie that is hilarious, clean and does not talk down to adults.  All ages will enjoy this movie.
1400064287|5.0|The Heath brothers state that sticky ideas are:<br /><br />1. Simple<br />2. Unexpected<br />3. Concrete<br />4. Credible<br />5. Emotional<br />6. Story Driven<br /><br />The book makes strong points for each principle, and the list makes intuitive sense.  As a marketing professional, I refer to this model often.

B0015AARJI|5.0|[[ASIN:B0015AARJI PlayStation 3 Dualshock 3 Wireless Controller]]  What fun is a game when only one person can play when there are two people in the room?  Little.  That's why I purchased another PS3 wireless controller.  It works just like the other, so that makes it good while it's doubling our fun.
031606792X|3.0|Well to all the fans of the Twilight Series, this book has gone to a totally different path. This does not focus on Bella and Edward's love for each other like the first three books although you will still see a glimpse of that kind of feeling from them in this book and that Bella after the change still feel the same way for edward or more so than before the change. What happened to the love triangle of Jacob, Bella and Edward? I did not think that this book will have so many different characters added to it so now there's a whole lot of vampire in here. One of my biggest suprises is for Bella and Edward becoming parents.  I did not expect this. To tell you the truth I don't even know how to explain what I feel towards this book.  I know that i still liked it although it took me awhile to finish this book while the first three book i finished it in about six days. I don't know how they are going to make this as a movie there is just too many things that they need to cover and have to fit it in a 2 hour movie.  How is it possible without messing up the story itself? But oh well, I guess a good director and a scriptwriter will be able to manage this. This book I think is more focused on how they are going to be able to have the Volturi to understand that their daughter is half human and not an immortal child (she has also been imprinted by Jacob). Well, as I've said, this is not a bad book, it is just not what I expected to turn out to be (it is not about Jacob's, Bella's and Edward's feelings for each other).
0471267554|4.0|I found this book after doing a bit of research on the internet about diet and health.  This book in itself is priceless.  It is full of nothing but pure logic that NONE of us follow, although we know it is in our best interest.  It really made me realise how we are gluttons for punishment, and how badly we treat our own \\"temples\\".  I have now been following the guidlines set forth in this book for 2 weeks and in that short time, at the age of 29, I feel younger and have more energy than I have in a LONG time.  If anyone is suffering from mild \\"symptoms\\" or \\"chronic unexplainable aches and pains\\", I would suggest trying this out.  Even if only for a month.  You WILL notice a difference in energy level, and mood.  I am in no way overweight.  I weigh in at 85 kilos for a 187 cm frame.  But since being on this diet for only 2 weeks, I have noticed a loss of \\"bloating\\" or \\"water-weight\\" in the amount of about 3 to 4 kilos.  JUST GIVE IT A TRY.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I thought that this was much better than the stage play.  It was definitely a light hearted movie that made you feel good.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I've seen this game before and finally bought one. Absolutely no regrets. The concept is pretty simple, but the game itself can get pretty intense. There were many moments of silence because everyone is intensely thinking about their next move and strategizing.   My 6 and 9 year old boys enjoyed it too.  It's quite addicting!... Once a friend dropped in unexpectedly and all of us playing just lifted our heads to say hello and continued with the game.
B001E75QGG|4.0|I will start off by saying that I was disappointed in this film when I first saw it in the theater. Although I was still bothered by a lot of the same things - the sets, that awful snake - I found that I enjoyed the movie much more the second time around, watching it a home. It was a high standard to match after such a long time had passed. There is everything that I loved about the previous Indiana Jones films. Some fans may be bothered by the passing of the hat - figuratively, thank goodness and others may find the science fiction nature of the plot to be a bit off kilter. Still and all, its a fun ride if you just let yourself go and enjoy it. The Blu Ray version has a stunning picture and sound, no complaints there.
B000ETQR3Q|1.0|I honestly can't see how so many people gave this a favorable review.  We got this gun as a gift for our five year old and it has been a nightmare from the moment we put it together.  It literally jams every other shot.  We have yet to make through a full cartridge.  My son refuses to play with it and I can't blame him.  It is one of the poorest designs I have ever seen.  Too many parts and the darts just get manganled and jam the gun.  Would not recommend to anyone.  Sorry Grandma.

B00192KCQ0|3.0|When I first got this and started listening to it I thought my speakers were blown. Weird cracks and sounds were coming out of them, interrupting the music! I took the CD out and put in Nostradamus and cranked that. My speakers are fine...    Anyway, I've listened to \\"Death Magnetic\\" many times now. It's an awesome CD, and it's really sad that the sound is so bad. The material is very good and it has grown further on me. As much as I would have liked for them to put out \\"Ride The Lightning Part II\\" this is not it. However, this album is a step in the right direction. Besides that, a band needs to evolve. And, I'm not one to give up on any band that has given me years and years of listening enjoyment. I would easily consider this their best effort since the Black Album. To me, to compare it with their other releases, it sounds closest to a combination of And Justice For All and the Black Album.     Oh, but did I mention that the sound and mixing of this album is horrible!?!? I tried to overlook this when I gave my 3 star rating. But I couldn't. Anyone associated with this production should be ashamed, or at least get their ears checked.     What would it take to get this to 4+ stars for me? Mainly production issues:    1. The bass could be brought to the surface a little more. Well, if all other instruments were lowered a bit that would work better.    2. Hetfield's vocals could be a bit angrier. But overall, a great performance by James. Thanks for continuing to make music for us :)    3. And, oh yeah, the sound is very difficult to get past. There is a lot of noise. You can not only hear distortion in the music, but there is noise at the beginning and end of every track, which, a CD should not have. As many other people here have said; I just have to wonder what they were thinking. The compression on this disc is insultingly overdone. It should be remastered, by someone that can hear.    Overall though, this album deserves good reviews if they are based solely on the material. As is, I gave it a 3, since all involved parties must have given the go ahead for final pressing. If my review were only about the material I would present a 4.4.     If you haven't yet listened to this album then stop reading reviews and buy it!
B001EYGOEM|3.0|I had never heard of Taylor Swift until this summer's Chicago Country Music Festival. She was scheduled for an evening performance I did not attend but I decided to buy on of her albums. It met my expectations for country/western music which I listen to occasionally.

0545128285|3.0|I bought the book for my niece and I because we are great Harry Potter fans even though I am 60 and my niece is 21 yrs. old. Amazon sold it at a very good price so I couldn't resist buying it. I was only a little disappointed, maybe because I expected to read more about some mysteries that were in Harrys' books. The fairy tales are likeable and the endings are good for children to understand.
0312427999|1.0|Naomi Klein often says that she doesn't support any conspiratorial theories that may arise from \\"The Shock Doctrine\\". Does she, really? Having read the book, one can't escape the fact that the very core of this treatise is about the conspiracy of free-market fundamentalists, conservative politicians and big corporations to run havoc in the societies, going through transformation periods, to destroy the social safety nets, to impose dictatorial regimes, to put the people in those countries in ultimate misery. And the figure of Milton Friedman looms as an almost satanic shadow over this. The trouble is, the facts do not support this theory. Just a few random examples:  1. \\"Chartered schools\\" experiment in Louisiana after Katrina is portrayed as a vicious attempt to privatize education system. The fact is that this type of private schools functions quite effectively in Sweden, the welfare state, much admired by her .  2. In South Korea, liberalization process which started in 1998 was not the cause (as she states it) but the consequence of excessive state-sponsored monopolization (chebols) and financial leveraging in major industries, that caused the Asian Crisis of 1997.  3. In Russia, the constitutional crisis of 1993 was caused by attempted violent coup-d'etat, organized by Communist party and leftist organizations. What followed was not a faithful introduction of laissez-faire capitalism but a corrupt redistribution of Soviet industrial assets among Eltsin political and business cronies in almost complete absence of rule-of-law institutions.   4. In Chile, Allende \\"Path to Socialism\\" caused inflation of more than 100%, disappearance of basic foods from the stores, flourishing of black markets. Although, the Pinochet regime brutally suppressed communist forces in the country and committed serious crimes in the process, there's also a very hard evidence that his government increased substantially the standards of living in that country.    Those are just a few examples that come to mind. The book is so full of twisted facts, outright distortions, journalistic diatribes against corporate excess (portrayed as capitalist modus operandi) that it just smacks of pure propaganda.     The central premise that multinational corporations and Western conservative governments with idealogic support of free-market fundamentalists are directly interested in creating economic turmoil, destroying social institutions and eliminating democracy can be very attractive \\"call to arms\\" for some people, not too interested in parsing through her sources. Others may just check the originals, like Friedman's \\"Capitalism and Freedom\\", or for example an excellent essay by Hayek \\"Why I am not a Conservative\\" just to get a different perspective to the not-so-subtly veiled conspiracy preoccupation by Naomi Klein.

The concepts are pure, spiritual, and will take some practice.

If you are, you will know someone who can benefit from it.    ~Carolyn  Nevada City, CA
B0008ENICU|5.0|Fast pace, witty - keeps you guessing what will they say ... what will they do next!  There isn't a \\"slow\\" second in the film.  It challenges you to be alert and pay attention - and the award for your effort is bountiful.  Rosalind Russell is her beautiful and amazing self.  The last couple lines of the film made me stand up and applaud - again.  After seeing this movie, you must see Auntie Mame!

It was more than I excepted (it hums just like Gizmo in the movie Gremlins) I got that for her too. She was so delighted and hugged if though she is 20yrs old. This is an excellent buy and I would tell anyone who loves Gizmo to purchase this one.

B001M5UDGS|1.0|I watched 15 agonizing minutes of this because of the high ratings on amazon. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. The songs are awful, the story is awful, the acting is awful. How this is getting so many 5 star reviews is beyond me. Is this a joke no one told me about?

1400063515|2.0|Promoting himself as a polymath, a sceptic and a disciple of David Hume, Taleb unfortunately has none of Hume's wit or elegance of prose. There are indeed some interesting ideas in this book, but Taleb takes an awfully circutous and unstructured route in delivering them. His irreverent tone is self-indulgent and perhaps funny only to himself and a few accolytes. I found the book tiresome and in need of a bloody good edit.
0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief is an astounding read, and one I will be thinking about for a long time.  As I sit here, though, I wonder, how do I categorize such a story?  It is very dark for fantasy, but very fanciful for historical fiction.  Despite how it is categorized on Amazon, it is not appropriate for anyone younger than age 16, unless they are very sophisticated readers.  It was released originally as a novel for adults, and that is correct - the themes and events here are far too dark for kids.<br /><br />I give nothing away here in telling you that Death is the Narrator of this story.  In these years of 1939-1943, he is kept very busy by mankind's clear intent to destroy itself.  In the center of this, though, is a young woman - someone Death learns about in an ingenious way, and about whom he grew to care a great deal, as did I.  She is surrounded by interesting, well-developed characters who inched into my heart, and whose probable fate I dreaded.  Sometimes I was surprised, sometimes my fears were sadly confirmed.<br /><br />I kept tissues handy while I read this novel, and a section about halfway through required several of them.  Liesel is a character who, while going through growing pains of her own, and sometimes showing herself to be as annoying as only teenage girls can be (as any parent can tell you), is an inherently good girl being raised by decent, caring folk, and I hated seeing this story end.<br /><br />Of special note here is Hans, who is introduced quite early and who is the slender yet iron-clad thread holding the story together.  His actions create the woman that Liesel will grow to be, and I loved him as much as I do another fictional father figure, Atticus Finch.  This is a brilliant novel, and if there is any justice at all in the literary world, it will be regarded as a classic now and in the future.
B00005LC1H|5.0|I cannot imagine a world without Basil Fawlty.    I have always been a fan of all things Monty Python, but John Cleese emerged as my favorite.  (If you've never seen Clockwise, give it a viewing.)  Anyway, Basil is the patron saint of all the put-upon, the cranky, the snobbish nobodies who are completely unable to rise to the occasion, any occasion, and behave themselves. We love Basil, the bitter and impatient proprietor of a little hotel in a British resort town, and his inexplicably loyal employees Polly and Manuel and his long-suffering wife, and the absurd situations they get themselves into and (try) to get themselves out of.  Many of the punchlines have become stock phrases around our house.  We are still nursing along the old VHS tapes.  I bought the DVDs as a gift, and it looks as though they have some interesting extras.
B000YABYLA|2.0|FULL DISCLOSURE: I watched this on HBO, not the DVD.  I can't believe this film was up for four Oscars (including Best Picture?!?!? must've been an off-year), and won for Best Original Screenplay.  I don't know any teenagers that talk like this.  But what completely did in the film for me was the parents' completely unrealistic reaction to their daughter breaking the news of her pregnancy to them.  THey were pretty much cool with the whole thing, with dry, witty comments - no raised voices?!?!  I've known people in this situation, where parents and family members FLIPPED OUT completely when they got the news, almost without exception.  I saw virtually no evidence that the family was SO tight they'd be ok with something like this.  There was virtually no conflict in much of this movie.  The subject of teen pregnancy, for the most part, is treated as a minor speedbump in the high school experience.  Almost NO complications, not a whole lot of complaints about physical ailments/changes/etc that come with pregnancy?!?! (oh, right, she pees a lot).  Almost no one, from the kids to the adults, seems to get the gravity of the situation (not one word about it jeopardizing college/futures?), at least not in convincing fashion, till the baby is crowning.  Some of the acting is good, but i think it's the writing that's thin here (in addition to the completely subpar, hipper-than-thou, off-key soundtrack full of some of the worst indie-rock i've ever heard, and endless hipster references).  they must've ate this up at Sundance.  Jason Reitman is a very promising and capable young director who did much better work with much better material in \\"THank You for Smoking\\", IMO.  I can't believe this picture was up for that many awards -WOW.

0790729628|4.0|But it's almost like an art movie, the first science-fiction art film... It's a futuristic film beautifully put together... It's really impeccably made by one of the great visionary directors... And you really saw a future that looked very different from the future you had seen before... A future that looked very believable like the visual-effects shots of the flying car going over a futuristic city... The fight sequence doesn't prepare you for the traumatic emotional side that there is in the film, it leaves you sort of broken...<br /><br />There is a beautiful, delicate emotional great scene that I remember when I first saw the movie... I'm in the theater and I'm so drawn in what Rutger Hauer's doing... I'm so drawn in by what the theme of the movie has brought us to... The magnificent moment where he is letting go of life... And in those last moments of letting go of life he's really learned to appreciate life to the point where he spares Deckard's life, and where he's even holding a white dove because he just wants to have something that's alive in his hands... It's an amazing sort of crescendo that's going and there's Rutger saying: \\"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. All these moments will be lost in time like tears in rain.\\" Hauer puts all the things that are so amazing about people: sense of poetry, sense of humor, sense of sexuality, sense of the kid, sense of soul...<br /><br />Scott brought out the best qualities in his performers... He coaxed and very gently manipulated performances from his actors that in some instances I think they've rarely topped...

I mean it's a very bluesy, dark story and told very compassionately...<br /><br />The overpopulation, the sort of crowd scenes is so rich and varied and there's such an extreme detail designing the magazine covers, designing the look of the punks, the Hare Krishnas, the biological salesman, everything is designed...

B001G5ZNE6|4.0|The record was a Christmas present that I ordered a bit late, but was delivered in a timely fashion with plenty of time before Christmas.  It was new and in the plastic wrapping, as indicated before I bought it.  However, there were a few creases in the record cover.  Not unacceptable, but a little disappointing. Overall, I was happy with the product and would buy from the seller again.
0671449028|5.0|We have read this book so many times I have it memorized.  I have to recite it every night right before putting my daughter down for the night.  It seems to help soothe her and she knows it's time to go to bed.  The story is a little silly and doesn't make sense but I don't argue with what she likes.
031606792X|5.0|It took me longer to read this book than the others. I went back and forth on whether or not to finish it. Stephanie Meyer knows exactly what she is doing. How she set the book up, was perfect. It appears that she is stringing you along, but by the end of the book, every loose end is tied up. Great Job Mrs. Meyer. A perfect finish to a perfect series for a perfect couple. I will definitely read the series over again at some point.
B000K4WPCC|5.0|I am glad that I was finally able to find this movie. Thank you for making it so easy to shop with Amazon.com. I have also been looking to buy Witchhouse 1 and 2, but I haven't been able to find these movies anywhere, maybe you can help me find them too.

B001GKJ2E8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. And not because Angelina was in it. If she wasn't in it, I still would have liked it. McAvoy is a good actor and I like how he played his character. Kind of innocent with a do-gooder edge. If you're looking for an action packed movie to fill your night, then this is it. It's a cool movie with great special effects. It's a bit funny too. The scenes with McAvoy's portly, bitchy boss are the humorous parts of the movie. Total entertainment and action from start to finish. The ending is a good surprise.
1433502402|4.0|I have really enjoyed using my new ESV Study Bible over the past few weeks. The translation is great (I'm switching from an NIV) and the study notes, maps, and charts are very helpful.     The only downside is there is little margin for adding your own notes. Although their notes are quite thorough, sometimes you want to add a personal note or insight. You can do so, but you have to keep it to a few words, or make a special footnote and add it at the bottom of the page or at the end of the chapter.     So, if you are a big note taker this edition of the ESV Bible may not work for you. I'm hopeful that the same edition with come with larger margins soon, as I wouldn't change anything else.
0765316897|5.0|Quite frankly the most satisfying ending to a fantasy series that I have ever read. Most fantasy authors seem to drag out their series, but Sanderson keeps the pace of the entire series moving. Frankly, I love the complex magic system and the character driven drama. This is epic fantasy done correctly--without ridiculously secondary plot lines. I was constantly riveted by the mysteries that kept me guessing until the end. Once again Brandon (as with the first and second) your gift for misdirection had me fooled. I await the new Warbreaker book (whenever that might be, as you are now writing the last WOT) with baited breath. Great work.
1401207138|5.0|[[VIDEOID:30754031]]Seeing that the Watchmen movie is coming out soon, I figured I had to put up a review on the book. It is the first time I'm reading the Watchmen and it took me 2 days.<br /><br />Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons has created a wonderful dark mystery thriller. This isn't really a superhero story since only Dr Manhattan has supernatural powers. That really surprised me a bit because why are there costume adventurers? The best part has got to be the storytelling, unveiling of events and character interactions. At the end of each chapters includes back stories like letters, biography (The Owl), newspaper reports from inside the comic world.<br /><br />For the Absolute edition, John Higgins is colorist and he has done a superb job at recoloring the whole series. The atmosphere created is really great and feels like the war is looming all the time.<br /><br />So what's different about the Absolute edition, compared to the hardcover or the paperback? Well, this book is huge and that makes the panels easier to read. The paper quality is thick, white and reproduces the colour brilliantly. Right at the end, there's lots of extra goodies like writeup on the creation process of Watchmen and its characters, some pages of scripts and rough panels developed for them, unpublished promotional posters and other stuff.<br /><br />Comic readers should seriously consider getting the book. It's currently the top seller on Amazon.<br /><br />I would recommend reading the book first before watching the movie. It's really hard for movie adaptations to be better because books offer subtlety so much better.<br /><br />(More pictures are available on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B001DJLCRC|5.0|The characters are lovable, the plot interesting, and there is suspense.  Can't wait for Season 2!
B000002I27|5.0|Strange Days is about as good of a follow up to their self-titled debut  album as there can be.  The one main difference with this album compared to their first album is that the band used a session bass player (string bass) instead of keyboard bass provided by Ray Manzarek.  Also, the album wasn't recorded all live - that is, it wasn't recorded in just one session for each song, unlike their debut album, which was virtually all live recordings of each song in the studio in one session.  Still, it retains much of the signature sound of their debut album.  The Doors started to change their style a little bit after Strange Days.  If you are new to The Doors' music and want what I consider to be one of their two 'psychadelic' albums (along with their debut album), then get Strange Days.  Standout tracks include the title track, You're Lost Little Girl, Unhappy Girl, Moonlight Drive, My Eyes Have Seen You, I Can't See Your Face In My Mind, and When The Music's Over.  A classic Doors album that is a must have for any fan.

0061689246|4.0|Stardust starts off in the English countryside in a little town called Wall. Everyone who lives in Wall knows about a nearby high stone wall leading to a meadow, which no one is allowed to pass. Two guards are stationed at this wall night and day, only once every nine years the villagers of Wall are allowed to pass into the meadow beyond, into the land of Faerie, when the May Day fair arrives.<br />Sixteen year old Tristran Thorn is in love with the beautiful Victoria Forester and he wants to marry her one day. When he asks her to marry him, Tristran tells Victoria that there is nothing he would not do for her. He will go to the ends of the Earth to get her jewels and gold. Victoria laughs it off, then they see a falling star, beyond Wall. Tristran tells her he will bring her that fallen star. She tells him that is what she wants, the star. And if he can get it for her, she will do whatever he wants of her.<br />Tristran soon sets off beyond the wall and into the land of Fairie in search of the star. He encounters a magical land where there are witches, fairies, gnomes and all kinds of other fairytale creatures and where nothing is what it seems.<br /><br />I found Stardust to be a wonderful read. I liked the storyline and characters. It's a fairytale, geared more towards adults, I didn't expect that. I was quickly sucked into the plot and didn't want to put the book down. I like how Gaiman wraps everything up in the end.

1416562605|5.0|This 2008 novel won the Man Booker Prize and has become an instant best seller.  I can well understand why.  It is original and comic and is right on the cutting edge of the economic miracle which has recently transformed India into a unique competitive contender in the technological revolution.<br /><br />Through the eyes of the protagonist, a low caste young Indian man who has transformed his life of by murdering his boss, we get to know him through his first-person voice as he tells his darkly comic and edgy tale of how he rose from being a lowly servant to an entrepreneur. His voice is clear and funny and very very real.  But he is not a sympathetic character.  Rather, we admire him for his will to survive in the climate which has pigeonholed him into his lifestyle.<br /><br />Often, I cringed at his descriptions.  And sometimes I had to laugh out loud.  But I was always aware of this very modern story which takes place in an India that is transforming right under our eyes.  There is still vast wealth with all kinds of corruption of the police and government officials.  There is still a horrible unfairness to the lower caste people who are always at risk of having their entire families murdered if they resist too much.  There are the newly rich and the servant class and the shopping malls where only the rich can go.<br /><br />The book is a fast read.  Sometimes I cringed.  Sometimes I laughed because of its weird sense of humor.  But mostly, though I came away with a sense of the brand new India with all its inconsistencies and realities.  It might be a little too harsh for some, but I really loved it.

B001GM0GNC|3.0|I know they're not as young as they used to be, so some of the keys have been lowered....some of the tempos retarded.  But as another reviewer stated, the Police just seem to be \\"going through the motions\\" in this concert.  It's not hard to figure out why they decided to tour after so long.  With total guaranteed grosses in the hundreds of millions, how could they not?  One thing I love about live recordings is the rawness, and even the mistakes.  It reassures me that real humans are actually playing their instruments and singing.  I like the slop, the hums and buzzes, and the 'clams' which now are absent from any recent \\"live\\" album.  I'll cut Andy a break for dubbing in the second guitar part on \\"Message\\".  That guitar harmony is an integral part of the sound of that tune, and impossible to do by one's self.  But this recording is just too damned 'clean'.  With 45 years' experience as an audio engineer, I can tell when vocals are live or have been re-done in the studio and about 75% of Mr. Sumner's have been re-recorded.  Stuart Copland is the hero here.  His energy and expertise on the drums keep it all together in spite of Sting and Andy's somewhat uninspired playing.  Don't get me wrong.  I love this band.  They rank among the top ten groups of all time.  I'm just a little disappointed with this effort (or lack thereof).
B001LRJH0U|3.0|Being a fan of Harris, Mortensen and Irons, I looked forward to this film.  I found all of them up to their usual high standards but the movie overall to be rather underdeveloped and downright odd in the part concerning Allie, the somewhat upscale lady of loose morals who appears in town, strikes up a coy conversation with the two lawmen (Virgil and Everett) and ends up the next morning announcing that she and Virgil are buying a house together at the end of the street.  At this point I began to wonder about Virgil--his persona up to then as a no-nonsense, slow-talking gunman did not seem in tune with his almost instantaneous befuddlement with Zellweger's character, particularly since they contrived to make her look downright unattractive with a squinty, rather red face and a crimped-up head of red hair.  Moreover, while I suppose the role played an essential part in testing the 12-year old relationship of the two leads, I found the way it was introduced and thereafter constantly intruded to be very irritating and distracting.  Lonesome Dove managed to convey a friendship between two hard men without letting their various feminine associations send it off the rails.  However, the friendship here is still the heart of the story and the two actors are good enough to keep it from going under.  The basic story of the small New Mexico town terrorized (or at least seriously irked) by the wicked rancher and his gang is standard western fare but it is given a more modern and shorthand treatment which is interesting if somewhat superficial.  Overall,an enjoyable movie for the most part but certainly not a great one.

0545128285|3.0|Since this is a collection of short stories, I think it best to review the stories one by one and then let you decide for yourselves whether the book is worth buying or not.<br /><br />The Wizard and the Hopping Pot<br /><br />This is a very simple story. So simple that it is insipid actually. Dumbledore's commentary regarding the anti-muggle sentiment amongst the wizarding community is more interesting than the story itself.<br /><br />1.5/5<br /><br />The Fountain of Fair Fortune<br /><br />A typical kind of fairy tale, which depicts how 3 witches and a knight, by wit or sheer luck, overcomes the obstacles on their way to the hilltop where the Fountain of Fair Fortune is located. It's believed that by bathing in the fountain, one would receive fair fortune forever. Maybe I should note that the intended age group for this story (entire book?) is most likely 5-8. The Dumbledore's commentary includes a somewhat heated exchange of words between the old headmaster and Lucius Malfoy over the blood purity of the so-called pure-blood families. If you're a hardcore Malfoy fan, you may want to check this out.<br /><br />2/5<br /><br />The Warlock's Hairy Heart<br /><br />This is the one many worried moms described as \\"dark\\", \\"gruesome\\", \\"not for my kids\\". All I have to say is if they considered this dark, chances are they themselves had never read the Harry Potter series, of which their kids are most likely a big fan.<br /><br />2.5/5<br /><br />Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump<br /><br />This one tells the tale of a foolish muggle king who wanted to learn magic and a charlatan with no magical power took advantage of that by volunteering to be his instructor. What the king did not know was that there was a true witch in his palace all along. It is actually a better stories in the collection, and Dumbledore's commentary is an added bonus because it sheds some light on the differences between being an Animagus and Transfiguring oneself into an animal.<br /><br />3.5/5<br /><br />The Tale of the Three Brothers<br /><br />Those of you who had read Deathly Hallows are already familiar with this one. It should also be considered one of the better tales in the collection. Dumbledore's commentary on the Hallows, mostly the history of the Elder Wand, maybe the reason you want to buy this book. Though, frankly, not many interesting tidbits were added.<br /><br />3.5/5already familiar with this one. It should also be considered one of the better tales in the collection.

0061564893|1.0|1421 starts with an idea, worthy of an alternative history series, then looks for anything that might support it.        Menzies treats assumption as fact, interprets sources to support his belief (I can't even call it a theory!), and generally warps his materials.  Unfortunately, his book does more to degrade the serious issue of Chinese seamanship - an area of Chinese history that doesn't seem to have much visibility for western readers.  China's general aloofness and sometimes closed society makes it easy to assume that there was never such a thing as a Chinese navy.  To the contrary, Chinese junks were supremely seaworthy vessels used in an expansive trade during certain periods of Chinese history.    Although the book is basically a good read, I found myself distracted and then disgusted with the author's continuous references to his paramount ability to interpret the possibilities because of his naval experience.  Once or twice, okay.  Over and over again makes one wonder just how paramount that ability is!
0375842209|4.0|It's a simple story, really. A young German girl named Liesel is delivered to foster parents in a small town outside of Munich while Hitler rises to power. Her life is changed forever when her family hides a Jew in their basement.<br /><br />The beauty of this story lies in it's simplicity. The ease of the storyline allows author Markus Zusak to focus on the human condition. Interestingly, Death is chosen to narrate the story. This takes a bit of getting used to as the reader gets accustomed to Death's \\"voice.\\" As it turns out, Death is a brilliant narrator who masterfully foreshadows the story, compelling the reader to turn the page.<br /><br />This novel is chock full of poetic and simple illumination about the human condition. Evil exists in the world and while the universal question of \\"why?\\" cannot ever be fully answered, Zusak reveals both the beauty and ugliness of the world through his young characters.<br /><br />You may well be wondering where the title The Book Thief figures into the story. That's easy: Liesel, a good girl at heart, feels compelled to steal books and the impact of books on her life cannot be overstated.<br /><br />Indeed, the power of the written word is laced through the novel. The witholding of words when books are banned and the misuse of words to accomplish evil deeds are an important theme.<br /><br />This is a young adult novel, but recommended for teens and adults alike. The story is certainly a powerful one and probably ought not to be missed.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Brilliance seems to run in the Whedon clan.  I had already purchased all 3 chapters from iTunes, along with the soundtrack.  The idea of Commentary the Musical made me have to get the dvd, too.  And I was so not disappointed.  Dr Horrible takes the best from musicals and superheroes.  I loved every minute of it.      Buy this dvd!  Then, if you haven't already, check out Firefly and Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel and Buffy Season 8 and anything else Joss has done.  I haven't been disappointed yet.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|This SONY PS-LX300USB is a great piece of hardware in its original form and and a great piece of software when set up for its USB capabilities, it will help convert all our old Ablums and LPs, that we took such good care of, into MP3 allowing us to load those impossible to find songs on our IPODs. Went looking for a good turntable and SONY fulfilled my needs once again.

B000RG1FMO|5.0|The true Kanye shines through on his albums, forget what you hear about him and what the media makes him. This album is absolutely incredible. A monumental achievement. Focused; no skits. Mature natural progression of the College trilogy. Lots of layers. Synth. Poppy. Melody. Choruses. Awesome use of samples. Very catchy. Great rhymes. Original delivery; singer-like. Killer opening track to album. Album flows flawlessly. Honest. Feel-good. Colorful/poppy artwork perfectly encapsulates music, making them work together as one of visual and sound. Extremely listenable; repeated listens (I don't know if I've ever listened to an album more in my life). Beats aren't traditional hip hop, instead they have dynamics like a classic pop tune. Samples aren't straightforward; instead they're used creatively and obscured. Each song feels full and complete and maintains concentration without straying off the tracks. Although, the songs all stay relevant to the album, making it a beautiful package. One of the greatest albums of all time.
B001NZUA24|5.0|Whatever...I don't care what people say, I love this album. It's a great listen, great production, they have an incredibly unique sound. Patrick's vocals are hard to understand at times but the record is very well done regardless, the bonus tracks are cool - especially the [2] acoutic tracks that let you hear songs completely stripped down to bare bones and still are great for those who always say that the band is nothing without all the production! I can appreciate the lyrics more and I love that they included these on this release. I just wish they would let Joe Trohman [guitarist] show his stuff more, he remains somewhat buried in the mass. Check out something very cool on track 8, I was really surprised. This is a solid release as well as their last CD. Many people have a problem with FOB, too commercial, whatever. I am glad to have this disc.
0316017922|3.0|I thought the first half of the book was a interesting read but the last half falls apart.  Some of Malcoms theories or examples have some issues I think.     Take the Rice Paddy vs French farm workers. One lives closer to the equator and has a longer growing season while the other is in a more northern climate. so he is not comparing apples and apples for his conclusion of work in the fields.     KIPP schools seem a bit interesting but he sort of brushes over the hard facts and leaves some loose ends I thought.
0316017922|4.0|This is my third review of Malcolm Gladwell's books.  In both \\"The Tipping Point\\" and \\"Blink\\" I thought that he had 100 pages of meritable text that he redundantly expanded to fatten up the page counts.  A similar feeling also exists in \\"The Outliers\\" since the second half of the book drags compared to the page-turning early chapters.      However, in \\"Outliers\\", unlike his prior books, Gladwell  connects a series of seemingly disconnected events, at times spread over many years, to make his point, particularly early in the book.  In many respects it reminded me of Freakonomics, especially the unexpected relationship between Roe vs Wade and the reduction in the crime rate during the 90's.      This was both fascinating, and frustrating.  The fascination is derived from Gladwell's historical or chronological explanations of events that created the climate and opportunity for his outliers.  The frustration was caused by the sense that so much that has created the outliers has been by a combination of chance, luck, and opportunity - as much the reason for success as just pure talent.  For instance, someone born in 1920 would have been drafted out of high school into the WWII army, and been potentially killed or wounded during combat.  Someone born in 1930 would not only have belonged to a generationally smaller cohort of children born during the depression, but would also have bypassed the war, attended college and emerged onto the scene during the expansive 1950's, making their path significantly easier.    Here's the thing, however.  Outliers do not simply emerge by luck.  There is that little matter of talent AND at least 10,000 hours of concentrated practice.  We also need to remember this.    I think that the key to all of Gladwell's books is that they make you think.  For instance, if it is true that children born in the first quarter following the hockey eligibility date have an enormous edge in terms of future stardom just by virtue of their age differential, why aren't there additional leagues built around children born six months later to maximize skill development for additional, and potentially even better players?  The same thing can be said in terms of calendar date eligibility for kindergarten or first grade.  Why is there not a more flexible means of tapping into a greater number of children whose potential is limited merely by the date of their birth?    And, I also found the metaphor linking chinese rice paddies to intelligence very interesting, especially when comparing the concept of rice paddy management to the historical agricultural school schedule in the United States.  Is it time to realize that our agricultural roots are outdated?    I have read over other reviews, some of which are critical of Gladwell's lack of original research.  That is not an issue for me.  Sometimes you need someone to connect the dots.  My disappointment with Gladwell is that he identifies the dots, and in \\"Outliers\\" actually clusters them.  However, it is up to the reader to see the Rohrshach that they represent as metaphorical calls for action.  Too many readers will not connect the dots.  Gladwell could be more definitive in this regard.
0765350386|5.0|The first novel in New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy is an introduction to a fantasy world of class and standing where the poor suffer under the iron fist of the nobility who ignore them and pretend they don't exist.  Mistborn: The Final Empire reveals a unique realm where the mistborn possess powers of magic never before seen in any other fantasy novel.    Vin is a sixteen year-old skaa, a peasant girl who has never really known her parents, abandoned by an abusive brother, and spends her days working in a field with no hope of change.  That is until a tall and imposing stranger by the name of Kelsier shows up, dismisses her abusive boss like he is garbage and pays attention to her for the first time.  He tells her she possesses powers she is unaware of and then takes her away from her life of slavery, for she is mistborn.    The mistborn are very few in number, but the powers they possess are to be feared by many throughout the realm.  By ingesting small amounts of metals, a mistborn is able to \\"burn\\" a particular metal and exert a certain kind of power with it, also known as an allomancer.  Different metals that are burned result in different powers.  Steel allows one to push on metal objects such as railings, doors, coins, belt buckles, wherever there is metal nearby to be used, allowing one to push themselves into the air to great heights.  Iron allows one to pull on metals in one's surroundings, pulling them up walls and across open spaces.  Zinc allows the mistborn to inflame emotions in others, to make them angrier or sadder, or more fearful.  Brass is a soothing metal, allowing the user to calm and dampen other's emotions.  Bronze allows the mistborn to detect whether allomancy is being used by others nearby.  Copper allows mistborn to hide their use of allomancy.  Pewter, one of the most useful of the metals for an allomancer, allows them to greatly enhance their physical abilities, so they can be stronger, have fasterreflexes, and move exceedingly fast.  Pewter also allows them to sustain injuries and barely notice the pain and not be hindered when under attack.  Tin enhances one's senses, allowing them to detect sounds, sights, and smells better than any human.  These are the basic metals that all mistborn can use.  But when the small supply of ingested metal is extinguished, the allomancer must find more, or find themselves with simple, ordinary human abilities.    Then there is the metal atium.  A very rare metal that can only be found in small amounts within the crystalline caves of the Pits of Hathsin.  It is here that prisoners are put to work to search for the metal and suffer constant wounds from crawling through the narrow tunnels.  If the prisoner does not find a piece of atium, he or she is executed.  Atium serves as the most expensive metal in the realm, which everyone hungers for.  The Lord Ruler gives out small amounts to his nobles and keeps the rest for himself.  But when a mistborn swallows and uses atium, they have the ability to see future actions, choices made by an opponent during a fight, making it the most important and useful metal for an allomancer.    As Vin begins training with Kelsier, who is also a mistborn, she discovers she is to be part of a group plotting to overthrow the Lord Ruler, who has controlled the world for over a millennium, subjugating all to his tyrannical and merciless power.  With the help of the religious group, the Steel Ministry, which is controlled by the Inquisitors: a trained and bred group of people with giant spikes hammered into their eyes; they are feared by all for their terrifying appearance, as well as for their allomantic abilities.    But there are those - Pewterarms, Seekers, Soothers, Rioters, Lurchers, and Coinshots - who are able to use only one of the metals, and Kelsier has chosen the gang carefully, selecting specific people with specific talents and powers, and fully believes he can kill the Lord Ruler and themake the world better.    Sanderson's first book in his planned trilogy opens up a world with unique magical powers and astounds the reader, as well as keeping him or her reading nonstop to find out what happens next to the well developed and fascinating characters.  Mistborn: The Final Empire will make the reader go out and buy the next two books - Well of Ascension and Hero of Ages - in the series, just to find out how it all ends, and who remains alive on the last page.

0316067598|5.0|Very Very Good.  Amazing to read after hearing about these men on the news and then reading the inside scoop.
0765356139|5.0|In the riveting sequel to Mistborn: Final Empire, Sanderson doesn't hold back, continuing on from where he left off: the Lord Ruler is gone, but this was just the first mighty battle in the ongoing war.  In The Well of Ascension times are still hard for many, even though the skaa have been freed and Elend is now king of Luthadel and the surrounding territories.  The nobles must now learn to live in a democratic society where they cannot have slaves.  It is a different world for many.    Before the dust even has time to settle, King Elend faces problems from various fronts: there is dissension in his democratically elected cabinet who wish to return to the old ways; then there are three armies marching toward Luthadel.  Before our main characters can decide what to do, they find themselves under siege from two massive fronts.  One is controlled by Lord Straff Venture, Elend's father who wants his son to hand over his kingdom to him, no questions asked.  Then there is Lord Cett looking to seize control of Luthadel with his own substantial army.  Elend finds himself in a unique position where he can ally with one army and therefore be able to overthrow the other.  The question is who to ally with?     As he contemplates this a third army arrives, of koloss.  These are tall 9-15 feet creatures that vary in size but are terrifying to humans.  Originally created by Lord Ruler for his army, their skin is extremely wrinkled and hangs off them in places like loose clothing; while there are great tears in the skin and yet the koloss ignore this.  But their red, blood-rimmed eyes strike terror in all who view them.  They may seem dumb and slow, in battle they are fierce and destructive, and it's unknown whether they may lost control at any second and begin rampaging into the city of Luthadel.    Then there is Sazed, a loyal member of the group who is a Terrisman, a special person with the ability to store thoughts, memories, and knowledge in metal that is worn in the form ofrings or armbands.  Stored in these armbands are also other abilities such as great strength and speed.  But in Sanderson's world, it's all about balance, as the energy stored in each armband is finite, and in some cases can take many years to be stored up, but can be used and extinguished in a matter of minutes.  Sazed is a scholar and knows much is not right with the world.  Somehow the mists that are feared by many for a long time throughout the realm begin killing people and even wiping out whole villages.  There is the Deepness, a mythological force that was supposedly stopped when the Lord Ruler came to power, but is not fully understood and may bring terrible things to pass.  Sazed must also find the correct location for The Well of Ascension, for it is here that the Hero of Ages - who he believes Vin to be - will release the power and save the world.    Then there is the OreSeur, a kandra, an ancient race who are able to absorb the bones of a dead person or animal and take that form and appear almost identical to them.  OreSeur is Lord Straff's kandra, and is sent to spy on Vin, but it's also discovered that there's another kandra somewhere within Luthadel who, with the kandra abilities, could literally be anybody.    Finally there is the supposed Hero of Ages, Vin, who isn't sure what she is, but knows she is one of the most powerful people in existence, but must use her power wisely and not kill recklessly.  She befriends another allomancer, Zane, who seems very familiar, and she becomes close to him, for they have so much in common, and yet he is the allomancer for Lord Straff and therefore an enemy.    Sanderson continues the complexity of the world, with many moral and sociological questions coming into play, as well as adding new plots and subplots.  While it may seem a little overbearing, he skillfully keeps everything organized and separate and maintains the reader's interest throughout.  It is a sequel worthy of its name, as The Well of Ascension keeps the pace going from the first book, making the reader hunger for more at the last page.  The trilogy is concluded in The Hero of Ages.    [...]
1416562605|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The Booker Prize winners tend to be \\"odd\\" books in my opinion, but interesting all the same.  This one will not disappoint.  It paints a view of modern day India from the point of one of the poor servants (who are pretty much slaves).  I both identified with and was appalled by the actions taken by the narrator.  This book really made me think.  It would be a good book for a book group because it raises some interesting questions about loyalty to oneself vs. one's family as well as many other ethical questions.  I would definitely recommend this book.
0765316897|5.0|In Sanderson's thrilling and resounding conclusion to his Mistborn trilogy, he doesn't hold back, skillfully bringing all the different pieces, sub-plots, and characters together in a fitting end to the series.  While Sanderson has admitted that he may return to the mistborn world one day, it will be set hundreds of years in the future or past.  Nevertheless The Hero of Ages weighs in at almost six hundred pages and offers a very satisfying finish for its complex and powerful characters.    The Well of Ascension has been found by the supposed Hero of Ages, Vin, and the power has been released, except it is an evil spirit, Ruin, who seeks to end the world with the help of its deadly inquisitors.  The ash from the ashmount is falling thicker and stronger, choking the lands, preventing life from growing or surviving, while the great volcanoes are beginning to thunder to life, and the mists continue to terrify everyone, leaving some dead, others deathly ill, perpetuating the mystery.    Elend Venture, now emperor of the realm has two kingdoms to ally with in preparation for the end and the oncoming battle.  Leaving with Vin, he heads to Fadrex City which was formerly Cett's kingdom, but is now under the control of the obligator Lord Yomen, along with his army of koloss.  Spook, Ham, Breeze and others head for Urteau under the control of the maniacal Quellion.  But Ruin is somehow able to control both Yomen and Quellion, as well as stealing control over the koloss, outweighing the odds against Emperor Venture and his people.    Then there are the mysterious kandra race who are in a crisis of faith, for their sole existence is based upon the Contract which was written by the Lord Ruler, who is no longer; does the Contract therefore no longer apply?  There is the trial of TenSoon who has slain one of their own.  The First Generation of kandra sit silent and undecided, while the later generations are anxious and impatient, unsure whether to adhere to the Contract or rebel.Finally there is the great Sazed, the scholar who has lost his faith and will having researched every religion but one and finding nothing but lies and obfuscation.  It is with this last religion, the religion of his Terris people that is somehow tied to that of the kandra, that he holds on with a sliver of hope, seeking some final answers to the meaning behind the world, its gods, its peoples.    In The Hero of Ages, Sanderson ratchets everything up to its highest point, with the end times approaching and all hope dwindling.  The reader is hooked to the very last page, unsure of what will happen, who will survive, and wondering if this might really be the end of everything?

B001DHXT6G|4.0|I missed out on Star Trek when it first appeared on TV. I didn't have a TV at the time, nor did I want one. It wasn't till about the mid-70s (now with TV) that I became aware of Star Trek re-runs. I found them to be interesting and amusing. I'm a scientist and practically everything I knew about chemistry, physics, geology and biology had to be tossed out and replaced by psuedo-scientific jargon that sounded somewhat realistic and probable, but was, in fact, ludicrous. Yet, somehow, Kirk, Spock, McCoy and all the other wonderful cast members brought off a subtle space-age comedy that presented compelling viewing. I ended up taping about 20 episodes for a small library, but my project ultimately failed.<br /><br />My interest in Star Trek faded until I met a young lady, now my wife, and we started watching the \\"Next Generation.\\" First thing you know we finished \\"Deep Space Nine\\" and then \\"Voyager.\\" What next? Well, why not go back to the \\"Original Series?\\" So, I bought her this Remastered Three Season Pack for a Christmas (2008) present and we're now a little over two thirds through viewing it.<br /><br />The remastered Original Series has been spiffed up quite a bit relative to my memories of those old re-runs. I notice, in particular, that the colors are considerably brighter and bolder. Too bright and bold, in my opinion. Plus a lot of the colorations remind me of when my old Tube-type color TV set burned out one of the color elements and false colored images prevailed. I just don't care for this change. OK, the old color was rather bland and dull, but I'd just as soon view it that way. The sound has also been enhanced from place to place and I notice my sub-woofer come into play now and then. Also, a lot of the images of planets (particularly, class M) seem to be enhanced and modified. I suppose all these changes are meant to update and freshen the late 60s series, and the producers do a reasonably good job of it. Given the choice, however, I'd rather view the original series as it originally was. Oh well, it's fun to watch, in any case. But, if I had to do it over, I'd get the original unaltered versions.<br /><br />Gary Peterson.it originally was. Oh well, it's fun to watch, in any case.

B000002A3T|5.0|I've been listening to Pink Floyd since I was eight (The Wall), and when I first heard this album I thought it was very cheesy and too slick and overproduced. But after a few years, I think I now find it one of the best, or certainly up there with the best Floyd albums. 'Poles Apart' is especially good, but the whole thing (with one exception) stands up.
B0018QCXGY|3.0|Been looking forward to adding this to my BRD collection for a while now.  Picked up for a decent price on black friday.  Not going to say this is some \\"End all - be all\\" BR release.  But, if you like the movie as I did, and you'd like to add it to your library, this is more than adequate!  Solid release.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|A great product. The extras were well worth the wait for DVD and I'm happy to support this project.
0800177363|5.0|Here's a good example of how you can still make a great modern-day movie without profanity, violence or sex.  It's also a movie which never stops being fascinating.....at least to me.    This is an amazing story, based on fact, about about a doctor who makes great progress fighting an illness that heretofore was considered incurable. These were patients in catatonic states, and the good doctor uses an experimental drug to snap these people back to reality and to a normal life as they once had. The patients, and how they react, both before and after the medications, is really fascinating.    Robert De Niro is outstanding as one of the patients, but that's not a surprise knowing all the fine acting performances he's done over the years. Robin Williams, relatively new to dramatic acting when this came out, was also excellent in a very low-key role. Penelope Ann Miller is extremely sweet and appealing. I wish both she and Williams would do more roles like that.    With multiple viewings, I came to appreciate the minor characters in here a lot more, such as De Niro's mother, played by Ruth Nelson, whom I fondly remember in the 1945 film \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn.\\" What a treat is was to see her again and this was just two years before she died. Also, Alice Drummund as the patient known as \\"Lucy\\" was notable.    Language-wise, i's almost stunning to watch a movie which has De Niro, Williams, Miller and John Heard and not hear one profane word uttered! (The film isn't perfect, however, as some idiot decided to insert one f-word, and in a totally unnecessary circumstance.)    This is a memorable, haunting story and one I guarantee you won't forget because the subject matter is so different.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I am a great fan of Jane Austen and P&P and found the episodes of Lost in Austen a fresh look at the theme of today versus yesterday.  Amanda insists on trying to \\"fix\\" whatever is going on to fit the book.  The episodes were full of comedy and drama, I loved them.
B0000AK7AC|5.0|When this movie came out -- years ago, I thought, \\"Wow, this is pretty amazing\\" and since then movie audiences have been amazed at a number of camera tricks, computer-enhanced people, animals, monsters, and who knows what....so this kind of story with fun special effects/talking animals is no longer is unique.    However, it's still so charming, so nice a story that it should hold up as solid entertainment for a long, long time. It has proved to be anything but a flash-in-the-pan. This movie will endure. It's also a beautiful film on DVD with brilliant colors and some very rich visuals. I can't wait for the high-def Blu-Ray to be made available.    Filmed in rural Australia, the scenery is magnificent and so is the house that is featured in the film. It looks like some old-fashioned gingerbread house. The animals are entertaining, talking to one another like humans but not looking hokey in the process. In other words, the dubbing is well done.    The main character, \\"Babe,\\" the little pig, is the nicest, most innocent \\"character\\" you could ever hope to find. Listening to him talk is heart-warming most of the time and sometimes it's heart-breaking. The best comic relief is provided by the goose who wants to be a rooster. That may sound like it's geared toward little kids, but it isn't. I haven't found an adult friend yet who didn't like this film.    It also was good to see James Cromwell play a nice guy, too. Most other times he seems to play profane and corrupt cops or government officials. Here, he's just a nice old farmer who blends in perfectly with the surroundings. His wife is a bit annoying, but not too bad.    This is a wonderful, sweet-hearted comedy-drama with a nice ending, too, guaranteed to leave you with a smile or a tear, or both. This is one of the best \\"family\\" movies of all time.
1402714580|5.0|A must for the young reader!  Any girl who has a sister will absolutely love reading this classic book.  I loved it and my granddaughters love it.
B000NA2348|4.0|Since a lot of the comments here are regarding the sound quality, I thought I'd chime in too. I don't have a surround setup so these comments are just regarding the stereo CD. A careful comparison with the Ryko CD reveals the stereo \\"stage\\" is different on this new release. For instance, on \\"Win\\" on the Ryko release, the guitar is off to the far left, the sax to the far right, just like the original RCA LP. On this new release, the instruments are much more towards the center, creating a narrower soundstage. Furthermore, the sax seems to drift from right to left at some points. This leads me to believe the stereo disc is mixed down from the surround version, which I imagine has some of the instruments moving around at points. While the sound quality is overall quite good, I would prefer the stereo imaging mimic the original, not change things. The original LP did have a bit of an exaggerated stereo effect, but that's the way it was recorded.
B000063DGC|5.0|In my personal opinion Randy \\"is\\" and was the Greatest guitar player to ever thrash a six string. The studio albums do not give him justice because of his inability to reign free over his production by disrespecting producers who did not allow him to let loose with his recordings from lack of trust from a very young axeman. In contrary, this album shows you what Randy was capable of when Ozzy let him do his shine through. Simply incredible.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|The quality on Blu-ray is awesome and the extras are great. Lengthy interviews and behind the scenes information is great to have.
0525951113|4.0|I bought this book on a whim and because it was a good weekend to stay in from the sub-zero temperatures. I wasn't expecting much because this is the author's first book, but it delivers good character arcs, a good plot line, and believable technology upon which the plot rests.    If you're a gamer, an IT consultant/employee or a tech-geek who enjoys realistic fiction, you'll enjoy this book. And if you enjoyed works from Michael Crichton, then there's a high probability you'll enjoy this book.    The primary reason I enjoyed this book was because the computer system hacks were totally possible. At each phase of the plot, the methods of compromising the computers systems were not far fetched nor impossible to replicate. This kept me up late at night, reading chapter after chapter (I'm not an IT geek, either).    I didn't give it 5 stars because the style of prose is nothing special. The style in which Ernest Hemingway or Annie Proulx or Cormac Mccarthy writes is special and can carry a scene far beyond the elements in contains. The style of writing Daniel Suarez provides is geared toward easy consumption. In some scenes, he even provides descriptions that seem plucked straight out of a screen play (perhaps he hopes for a film option from this book).
B000B7QCKO|5.0|I enjoy music of all kinds but few artists create music that I never take a break from. Yanni is one.
B00168OINK|4.0|This movie has FIVE STAR audio and visual quality. If you are looking for a disc to show off the power of Blu-ray or High Definition, this is a great choice.     The movie itself, I think, it quite charming. Some may at first think that the motivation of the Po the Panda is merely to eat, and his passion at stuffing his face fuels his Kung Fu ability. But, this unrealistic fantasy is not the case. Such critics have stopped watching this movie halfway through.     The only criticism I have is that this otherwise stellar Blu-ray is missing the Furious Five short feature. This would have made the high def disc complete.     Great movie, fantastic image and audio. 4 1/2 stars.
B0001I561E|3.0|Initial order apparently lost/misplaced.  Replacement received in a reasonable time but not until after holidays.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Received this product very quickly over the holidays, very satisfied.<br /><br />Thank you!
B0017JKEL8|5.0|I won't go into the detail that many others have already done here, but suffice it to say that all aspects of this production are first rate.  Beyond the visual/audio experience, which is terrific, the stories that run across episodes are tightly intertwined and thought-provoking after the fact.  I can't give this enough stars.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|The movie is the best movie to date that stays true to the book.  I wanted to teach my students that movies are never like the book, but I couldn't prove my point with this film.  A+ all the way!!!
0143038419|1.0|I guess I'm not technically qualified to write a review, since I read maybe 1/5 of the book, but I couldn't finish it: The author struck me as myself at the age of maybe 15, utterly self-absorbed, doing ridiculous things to and with people, and failing to read big red warning flags in relationships.  I guess I also found her spiritual journey extremely boring since I became an atheist awhile ago.  Anyway, I like chick lit as much as the next girl, but this book is too boring to be chick lit, and not in the major league as far as a book with depth and trying to figure out life's dilemmas.  It is whiny and ridiculous, a roller coaster of mental illness that is repetitive after only the first 30-50 pages.
B000W4KT64|4.0|This movie arrived quickly, even during the Christmas season, and played through with only one tiny moment where the movie stuttered briefly. However it was in very good condition for a used movie.

B0014KD46W|5.0|I agree with the review titled \\"A tremendous surprise\\". I was expecting more of an \\"adult contemporary\\" version of Steve Winwood, but he's still got the creative energy, bluesy grooves and the \\"having-fun-making-music\\" vibe that he's shown in the past. I am most familiar with his early music projects with Blind Faith and Traffic (John Barleycorn Must Die is my favorite), and this album to me is a continuation of that type of music. The Eric Clapton guitar solo on Dirty City is classic Clapton, which obviously evokes Blind Faith just based on the musical pairing and their combined sound. Listen to Nine Lives all the way through, though. Every song is either excellent or very good. You'll be happy with this purchase if you like Winwood's sound and are a fan of his early music.
0385340990|5.0|Such a good book!  I felt like these were my friends and neighbors by the time this book ended.... I wanted more!!!
0765318741|3.0|Buyer beware! I thought when I was purchasing this book that the ENTIRE book was the story \\"I am Legend.\\" It's not. The story is only the first 170 pages of the book. The remaining 147 pages are of short stories by the author. I feel deceived. No where on the front or back cover does it tell you that. Books are expensive and I don't feel I got what I paid for. The story \\"I am Legend\\" was great, but the short stories have something to be desired. Just be aware of this before you purchase.
1594481717|4.0|As a right directed person I was interested to see why the right brain is the key to the future. I agree with his assessments and think anyone planning for the future should take them into account. I bought copies of this book for my co-workers.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Lost is fantastic tale of survival and mystery.  Catching it as its broadcast is usually a dismal failure for me, so purchasing it as it becomes available is a sure thing.   Having taught survival in public school, I have a feel for the story's authenticity.  Like \\"Castaway\\" with Tom Hanks, it tells the truth of survival.  I expect the kids that took my class, especially the weekend foraging portions just eat this stuff up while avoiding the waste of time \\"Survivor\\" presents.     \\"Lost 4\\"  came out too slowly.  I am waiting for season five and six.
1415926697|1.0|I am baffled as to how so many people can rave about this book.  In my assessment, it was simply an account of a highly neurotic woman dealing with a divorce.   And she finally pulls herself together at the end, when she finds another relationship.  The only pleasure I got out of the book was following a fantasy of traveling for a year, with no apparent financial concerns.
031606792X|5.0|I absoulutely loved the entire Twilight Saga, but by far Breaking Dawn was my favorite. The way that it tied everything up and I feel ended the way it should have was awesome. I have a soft spot for vampires, and I was thrilled that she continued the legacy of Bella and Edward on as something that was by no means evil.
0670020745|3.0|I found the author's detailed accounting of her experience of having the stroke and the initial  few days in the hospital, mesmerizing.   Couldn't put the book down!    Various parts, such as her description of her right brain taking over when she couldn't understand language and instead interpreting the \\"energy\\" she felt from her various visitors, were especially intriguing to me.   However, in my view, the last one-third of the book, being her \\"lessons learned about life\\" from the stroke, was an exhausting repeat of common sense and the obvious; skimming those pages was all that was required.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Going back to my days with the PS2, I can't remember not having the rumble feature. And when the PS3 came out and didn't have it, it just didn't feel the same. But everything is back to normal. The only drawback is that its a bit heavier than the SIXAXIS controller. Still LOVE it.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Great product. Was in brand new wrap condition. I am so amazed with the product i have ordered in Amazon.
B000LF73ZE|5.0|The book arrived very quickly and looked to be brand new, although it was advertised as being used. Thankyou for the great service and product.
B00006CXSS|5.0|this was the most awsome series I have ever seen in my entire life. i didn't realize what these \\"brothers\\" went through.  the special interviews with the actual soldiers on the last disc was amazing. god bless these men. i highly recommend this series.
B000089A06|5.0|This movie is the prequel to \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\" It is just as scary as \\"Silence.\\" But the characters are different. I was as thrilled by this movie as I was by \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\" Same type of suspense. Great movie.
0571202284|5.0|My son is in college majoring in film/animation and asked for this book for Christmas. He read it immediately and said he learned tons of stuff from it (he's in his sophomore year). He knows about some of the stuff the book talks about, but he said he got so much more information from reading this and he thinks it's going to be a huge help in his education. Definitely recommend this to anyone in the animation field.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|This movie the second movie about the battle between vampires and werewolves. I like this one better than the first one. The action is better, the scenery is better, it just feels better. Kate Beckinsale is as usual at the top of her scale, and always a joy to watch. The battles in this movie are top notch. Great stuff.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|and Dr. Horrible just needs to rule it!  A fantastic contribution from the genuis Whedon family.  Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillion have never been better.  You will be singing these tunes in your sleep.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|This is a movie about the Civil War. Jude Law goes off to war leaving Nicole Kidman behind. She and Renee Zellweger try to exist as they best can while he is gone. There are twists and turns both to his life and the girls', until he returns, and then there is the surprise ending. This is a movie I can watch over and over. It is beautifully done, with believable characters, wonderful scenery, and lots of humanity thrown in there. Good movie, good adventure, good drama, good romance with humor.
1416575464|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my sister who just bought a new house. She was so excited to get it that she wanted to start shopping for new stuff the next day. It came with a complimentary subscription to Domino magazine as well! It is full of great pictures and descriptions of how to decorate any room and situation. I would highly recommend it.
B00003CXDD|5.0|This movie is filled with magic, sword battles, brownies, elves, armies, monsters, an evil queen, and all kinds of fun stuff. Wonderful special effects. Although this movie was made in the 1980s, it is a classic fantasy you should not miss.
B000L212HC|5.0|Product arrived on time and in perfect condition.  This was a gift, so we were very pleased with the product and service.  Transfer to blu-ray is outstanding.
B00000K3CR|5.0|This is a movie about a 12 year old boy who makes a wish at a carnival to be \\"big\\" and gets his wish the next morning. He eventually gets a job at a toy company, but still wants to go home because he is, after all, still 12 years old. This movie is full of laughs, Tom Hanks is at his best, making you laugh in every situation. This movie has no nudity, no language, is definitely suitable of kids, and is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Definitely a movie to watch if you are feeling down.
0670020745|4.0|Dr. Taylor's book gives interesting, though at times annoying and under-informed, insights into the human brain. As I'm currently doing my graduate studies in Psychology, I found the book to be very interesting, though the first person perspective and narrative are a bit jarring (unexpected) at first. There's interesting discussions about the right side of the brain and it being the gateway to enlightenment. Though I'm not sure one can achieve nirvana by reading the book, it makes for interesting reading on our neurological circuitry and provides interesting, if not controversial, perspectives.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|In this movie Beowulf leads his warriors across the sea to help his friend King Hrothgar, whose kingdom is being terrorized by a troll, whose name is Grendel. But Grendel won't fight him. And it gets worse when he meets Selma, a witch. This tale kind of drags on, but it is beautifully filmed, and beautifully enacted; you have to be able to really WATCH it. It takes a while to get it. But once you do, it is really worth the watch.
B000000WA4|5.0|First of all, whenever you buy a double album, you're already getting a sweet deal: two CDs for the price of one. While some of the songs on this album ranged from mediocre to not so great (Sometimes, Billy tried to put too many tracks into a single song), some songs are fantastic hits that jump out of your stereo. Some of the better songs include Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, Tonight, Jelly Belly, Zero, Bullet with Butterfly Wings, Here is No Why, Muzzle, Thirty-Three, 1979, and Thru the Eyes of Ruby. I listen to these songs when I'm driving in a lot of traffic, and it always relaxes me and lets me experience the world of the Smashing Pumpkins (without distracting me from the road, of course.) Two thumbs up for this album. Remember, with a double album, it's hard to lose. Other Smashing Pumpkins albums that I recommend are Gish and Siamese Dream.
0123694965|5.0|Drawing stories and inspiration from the strangest of sources, Jesse has crafted the most comprehensive book on game design (and development) that is as entertaining as it is enlightening. Told through various \\"lenses\\", Jesse gives fledgling game designers an excellent starting point, and veteran designers a refresher course laden with new perspectives.      A must read for anyone interested in making games for a living.
B001D94L1Q|5.0|How does this package compare with the 18-CD Messiaen Edition on Warner Classics?  If I get the Complete Edition, will it make my 18-CD box redundant?  Anyone know if there is cross over?    thanks
6304712944|3.0|I've seen this movie several times because I love the Lerner and Lowe score -- but every time I've seen it I can't help wishing that Guinevere had been cast differently (and especially that Julie Andrews, who played the role on Broadway, had been cast). Vanessa Redgrave doesn't convey emotion well in this role -- she spends much of the time looking beautiful but vacant, and it's hard to feel sympathy for her character's dilemma as she falls in love with Lancelot, as she seems such a shallow person. Also, I wish Guinevere's singing wasn't dubbed -- the score has such lovely songs, it would be so much better to hear the real singing voice of the actress playing the role -- especially if it had been Julie Andrews' wonderful soprano.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I have the DVD box set as well but watching it in HD picture and sound quality was awesome. I enjoy every single episode, especially the first ones. The picture quality looks perfect on my screen and I'm pretty sure it's the same on larger screens too. I recommend buying this edition of Band of Brothers!
0451529308|5.0|This version is a compact pocket size of the complete novel, a classic by a great American author. The print is quite small, due to the book's small size, but the binding is nice for a four dollar book, and my younger sister (for whom I purchased the book) is enjoying her forays into the innocent fun-filled world of Jo, Meg, Beth and Amy. Classic values of modesty, honesty, kindness and love meet challenges such as poverty, death and war, and the March sisters discover that love and faith can overcome even great obstacles. A book every young girl should read!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video kicked my butt! I am sooo sore I can hardly sit down! There is 3 levels to this video which is great because I'm back to the exercising game and this is perfect. I bought a video because some days its simply TOO cold to go out for a walk and before I join a Gym I want to know I can commit to exercising. This video is an easy commit since its an intense 20 minute work out per level. I also believe she explained the exercises correctly and she wasn't cheesy like other video's I've tried.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I've actually got the original DVD set of this series... but purchased the Blu-Ray set for my dad for Christmas.  Made the series even better.
B000UBMWG4|2.0|I am one of the unlucky shoppers who got a \\"misprint\\". Disc one which should be the final cut is in fact a 2nd copy of disc 5, the \\"workprint\\". Based on some reviews of the final cut maybe I'm not missing much, but it's annoying to have to exchange this. I knew there was a problem when I put in disc one and it looked lousy in hi-def. There is a separate disc with the US and international release versions along with the director's cut, which are all much better quality.
0810993139|5.0|This book is very funny and amusing to kids. Its a story about a middle schooler in the same school with a bunch of kids that are already shaving.
B000Q67876|5.0|This is probably one of the BEST movies ever made. The movie is well written, the characters are GREAT and Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are Excellent together.It's a shame that this movie did not win an academy award. As far as the BLU RAY version.....it is a MUST have in BLU RAY. This movie was made for BLU RAY. The colors are nice a crisp, very detailed and the sound is awesome. If you have a Blu Ray player and a nice surround system set up, this is one that you will pull out when company comes over to show off the GREATNESS of BLU RAY! For those of you who are \\"on the fence\\" about Blu Ray, once you watch this movie in BLU RAY, you will be convinced!
B0000A0DRY|5.0|The album is absolutely brilliant, so that need not be repeated at this late date. I wanted to address the re-mastering concept, for this album and many, too many others. Who are all these people raving about various remasters: \\"the voices are finally clear where they were muddy before,\\" \\"i am a recording engineer and i know that this...\\" etc. And, of course, you must have high-end components and play the CD loud to hear the differences. In as many as 80% of cases, and this issue of Surrealistic Pillow falls into that percentage, the remastering is plain hokum designed to make money of rabid fans who must have every new improved version, and then convince themselves that it is, indeed, somehow improved. For the most part, the remaster is simply way louder, period. The glitches are still there, only now you can hear them more clearly, and if that doesn't make you think, nothing will. I'm not talking about tape hiss, if that bothers you, you shouldn't even be reading this, and you're condemned to never listen to some of the best music on the planet; there are actual glitches, such as poorly overdubbed words that must have been screwed up originally - there is only so much you can do with original tapes, people. For those of you born into the digital era, understand that there are no pre-mastered tracks that you can simply plunk into the console and master ad nauseam. But in the specific case of Pillow, we have a doozy: hasn't anyone, including the fabled mr. recording engineer, noticed that some of the tracks, if not all, have been speeded up? I don't know why, perhaps at higher speed those glitches I was talking about fly by to quickly to be noticed, perhaps it's part and parcel of compression which allows for loudness, I've no idea. But you can easily check this for yourself: take your old CD and pick a song, for instance DCBA-25, and go to a clear point of reference: say, those final five or six rising guitar notes that end the song. Now look at your CD player's display and note on what second the last note falls. Go to the new, remastered CD, and repeat the process.  For the rest, you should similarly do an A-B comparison; presumably you have a multi-well CD player; load the old and the new CDs, play the songs a bit to figure out exactly how much you have to increase or decrease the volume so that you're playing each song at the same volume level, and compare. I think that you'll find that once the volume is equal, you're left with very little noticeable progress from the old to the new. Certainly not worth the price. Be wary in the future: unless the artist themselves are involved and have decided to remaster in some tangible way, you're just being given a greater dynamic top and bottom end, and taken for a ride.
B000IOLZZW|5.0|I was very impressed with the movie and with how quickly i received my package. Very reasonable seller and good quality items.
B001J53X9U|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.      Acting, special effects, storyline, everything.    Blu-Ray makes it that much better.  I almost enjoyed it at home better than the theater.
B00000JCOV|4.0|I think this is a great album.  they're carefree, balls-out insane, and they jsut put together an excellent record.  i've been listening to slipknot since 1999, and i love their first two albums.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|For a Blu-Ray disc it was fantastic, everything was gorgeous and the music was crisp and bright.    As a movie it kept me entertained and of course ABBA is always great    The kicker was it was a great gift for my mom, many bonus points!
B00005A46T|5.0|This is the best album Slipknot has ever made.  Every song is incredible.  and it was the last good album they made too.  personally, unless they were to have mad a similar sound to Iowa, they could ahve stayed, but since they had released Vol. 3, they should have quit.  I absolutely loved Iowa, and i used to listen to it all the time.  but then their last two albums came out and i stopped a little bit.  i jsut can't believe how good this album was put together.  it's AWESOME!!!!!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I was notified that my order will be later than initially thought.  Turns out it came earlier.  Planet Earth on Blu-ray....its the only way to watch something as breathtakingly gorgeous as this. Everyday we see awful, depressing things on the news and internet.  Its nice to be reminded that there still is some beauty in our world.
B001GKJ2FC|3.0|This movie is a thrill ride of action sequences that are very well done. The movie is campy, crazy, silly, a blood bath, gripping, funny, and always entertaining. Incomprehensible plot aside (a loom that is controlled by fate and spits out binary code?) the movie is darn fun to watch. It's a guilty pleasure for sure, but it's more full of pleasure than guilt if you know what I mean. James McAvoy who plays the protagonist Wesley is likable in that Michael J. Fox sort of way from the Back to the Future films. Angelina Jolie turns in strained performance (she's becoming a bit of a method actor these days), but is fun to watch none-the-less.<br /><br />The action sequences are all extremely well done. Riding atop moving trains, carefully choreographed car chases (with the initial Dodge Viper vs. delivery truck very reminiscent of the car chase in TERMINATOR II), intense shoot outs, curving bullets, and mass mayhem make the movie a carnal, visual feast. Shot almost entirely in Chicago, Lower Whacker, the Green Line El, Lake Street, and the southeast side all play prominent roles throughout the movie. For a Chicagoan like myself, this made the movie even more fun to watch!<br /><br />The nice thing about this movie is that it knows what kind of movie it is. While the plot may not make much sense, there is a sense of fun about the way it is put together, a sort of postmodern humor that makes even the far-fetched nature of some of the scenes palatable.<br /><br />3/5 stars. Well worth a rental, and possibly purchasing if you enjoy action flicks.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|Amazing, fast, so many options. I have just skimmed the surface of what it can do and I am in love.
0790733226|5.0|Great movie.  The cast is outstanding.  Gets you to think about how science and religion may not be at opposing ends.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|This is one of the best musicals I have seen in a long time. It is great family entertainment and I highly recommend it for all ages. You will keep singing the songs long after you have spent joyous moments viewing it. A real treat!!!
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre, and was excited to see it again at home--I enjoyed it as much the second time as I did the first.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is the best DVD workout I have ever purchased. It is exactly what I was looking for: 20 minutes, weights and cardio.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Heath Ledger is amazing of course but he is not the entire show.  this movie is flawless from start to finish and the picture quality on blu-ray is jaw dropping.  5 star release
B000I0QK74|5.0|James Taylor performing with the brilliant musical arraingements of Dave Gusin along with a wonderful mix of great supporting  musicians.  Let me tell you folks - It just does not get any better than this!  WOW!!!
B001EOQWFI|5.0|Blu-ray movies are definitely worth watching, especially if your TV supports 1080p resolution. This movie looked amazing and me and my friends loved the story. It's a little bit of a kiddie movie, but not really. Any adult will enjoy it too.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I loved the whole soundtrack. After seeing the movie and then listening to the cd I can picture the part of the movie the song is in. I was kind of disappointed that not all of the songs are on the cd. There is one song that I love called \\" Let me sign\\" it's by Robert Pattinson and it is at the part when Edward is sucking the venom out of Bella's arm after James bit her. I know now that they made 2 soundtracks for this movie and of course the one I don't have has the bonus tracks on it and I can't find it anywhere. Like a lot of people I thought Bella's Lullaby would be a lot different. I think it is a pretty song. It's just now the Bella's Lullaby I know from the movie.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|Jane Austen's \\"Persuasion\\" is an excellent movie - but one must pay close attention to who is who, otherwise the tale can be lost in the multitude of characters.  Perhaps this is typical Austen fare - family relations interacting with each supplying bits and pieces of information - but the danger is that the relationships between the characters is hard to follow interfering with the story.  We were able to stop the DVD periodically and go back to review what had been said in order to clarify the story.  After having watched it, we agreed: now that we know who is who, we should watch it again to better enjoy the story.<br />  I recall that some of the Earle Stanley Gardner \\"Perry Mason\\" stories included a list of characters and their relationships at the beginning of the book.  Something along these lines might have been helpful in this movie - but I am unsure how one would accomplish this.  Perhaps as a DVD \\"Extra Feature\\"?  I suspect the novel more clearly identifies the characters, but for those who have not read the novel, who is who is hard to follow.<br />  The love story between Ann and Captain Wentworth is excellent and builds to a climactic ending easily forecast perhaps 3/4 of the way through the movie, but we are forced to wait for it.  These anxious movies increase the charm of the tale.  Being a fan of the Patrick O-Brian Aubrey-Maturin series of historical novels, stories involving naval officers ashore are as interesting as those of adventures at sea.  The period dress seems authentic and the settings appear genuine.  I highly recommed Persuasion.  Indeed, I may even be \\"Persuaded\\" to read the book!
B001E75QGG|5.0|Great movie, done in yet the same style as all of the rest of the Jones movies, well worth getting on blue-ray.
B001GKJ2E8|3.0|If you've seen either Day or Night Watch, this movie may dissappoint. I found it kind of lacking in ideas, and somewhat predictable. All that being said, if you've not seen another of Timur Bekmambetov's movies, then you will probably like it.     Oh, and Jolie is hot as always...
076535618X|4.0|Read all three books in the set, starting with \\"Old Man's War\\" - this is wonderful writing, and really fun science fiction.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|My wife and I purchased the \\"High School Musical 2 - Extended Edition\\" for my niece.  Her sister and her now both watch it together dancing and singing together.  It is a trip!  Good fun, clean, movie for the girls to watch.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|Great movie.  It took a little longer coming than expected, but I had pre-ordered so I guess I should have known better.  Also the packaging wasn't so great.  Flimsy paper packaging.
B001GKJ2E8|2.0|I will try to make this quick and as painless as possible. FYI I will spoil a few points of the plot. Wanted takes everything you know about the laws of psychics and throws them out the window and gives you high octane CGI slo-mo action instead. There is a great ensemble cast in this roller-coaster ride (Jolie, Freeman, McAvoy). However, \\"curving bullets\\" was just ludicrous, and there was no supernatural or fictional backing to explain how they did this, but they just \\"gangster drew\\" their gun at an angle to curve the bullet-- absolute hog-wash.     The script is poorly written and hopes that you aren't taking any kind of mental notes on character backgrounds or making logical sense of the overall story. Looms are used to predict deaths of people with a binary code. Hmm I'm pretty sure binary was created with advent of computers not with ancient monks 1000 years ago. There is little if no background on the \\"Fraternity\\" except a short ill-lived montage.    There are some good laughs and \\"owning\\" scenes (when McAvoy kicks down the door to his ex-gf's and storms into the bathroom, then kisses Jolie in front of his ex). Also when Morgan Freeman says \\"Oh f**\\" and gets sniped from miles away-- I believe this is the first film where Freeman drops the \\"f-bomb.\\" Additionally the action scenes are worth viewing.     All in all, rent this to say you've seen it then make fun of its ridiculous plot devices. I do believe Morgan Freeman was saying \\"Oh f***\\" when he say the box office results of this failed action flick. Freeman and Jolie are so tenured into the industry that they can pay to do failed b-movies once in awhile... I'm sure this film will end up in the Walmart 5 dollar bin soon.
1434609723|5.0|This is a classic happy/uplifting book.  Looking for a pick me up in tough times, read Pollyanna.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I have a friend who owns a pair of the Sony MDR 5000 series, which he purchase years ago. I worked a mini-documentary audio project with his 5000 series headphones and I was sold! The Sony MDR line is very durable and built to last. I'm a Media Productions major so having a professional pair of headphones to monitor audio in production or post-production is critical. They babies are muffled, offer great midrange, lows, and highs. The cord is huge and also curled to stretch. They easily fold up and fit into a leather pouch that is provided. I bought these headphones after reading the reviews here at Amazon and knowing the Song MDR reputation for great quality and durability. The packaging is so amazing that you may not want to get them out of the box right away (comes incased on a decorative piece of white satin...extravagant packaging indeed). If you need a pair of headphones for any professional application this is clearly the best choice. Also you can't beat the deal that Amazon offers. You will impress you clients and fellow co-workers with these bad boys; they're just one piece of needed pro equipment to complete your ensemble. Might I mention these are perfect for entry level videographers.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|I ordered two sets of the Planet Earth series (one as a gift) and now two households are enjoying a marvelous learning adventure.  The dvd's arrived quickly and, as stated, in \\"new\\" condition.  We are very pleased with the service and the product.
B00005R8GU|5.0|I remember previewing this album at a used record store on a trip to Boston.  I only listened to the first few seconds of each track, because I was already home.  Perhaps my favorite album.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Wall-E is an excellent family movie for all ages and I'd consider it to be a future Disney classic!
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I admit to not being overly fond of these type movies, but the Hype and my like of Heath Ledger had me order this DVD.  I was not disappointed.    Ledgers performance was spellbinding as was the rest of the cast.  I heartily recommend this movie.
B00023B1LC|5.0|I am really into the Bourne series and own all three dvds separately (not a collector's edition). I bought the set for my dad as well. This is a movie that you can watch over and over and still find it just as cool!
B000A59PMO|5.0|Wow! I had never even seen one episode of this show when it was on the air, so I was really taking a chance when I purchased season 1 purely on the basis of the product synopsis and customer reviews.<br /><br />I am so glad I did. From episode 1, Veronica is a witty, cute, strong willed girl who is really likeable. Her dad, Keith Mars is also a strong character and the humor, he and Veronica share is a wonderful piece of the shows success.<br /><br />Each episode features Veronica helping her classmates, working on her best friend, Lily Kane's murder or getting even with the spiteful 09'ers who shunned her after she chose to support her father when he accussed Lily's father of murdereing his own daughter.<br /><br />The show gets more intense with each episode until finally we get the powerfully intense season finale. Let me tell you...I was online ordering seasons 2 and 3 while the credits were still rolling.<br /><br />Awesome series! Couldn't stop watching! 5 STARS!!!!!
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|I bought the entire Bourne series for my dad, and own the series myself. With each subsequent movie in the series, the action gets more intense, and Matt Damon becomes my hero over and over again!
0446579939|2.0|I am sure the book is good but I ordered it in  large print and they sent regular print.  I   couldn't read it so I donated it to the library.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|The complete series is just that...and MORE! The packaging is exceptional...nice and compack and, easy to store. Bonus DVD's are a great way to see \\"behind the scenes\\". I watched ALL of it within only 4 weeks!!! Also the \\"promised\\" arrival of the product was MUCH sooner!!! A MUST HAVE for all women, young and old who have ever had a close knit \\"girl group\\"!
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my mom for Christmas.  She loves it.  She watches all the reruns, but now she can watch from the beginning til the end.
B00006CXSS|4.0|The product was in excellent condition and arrived in a timely manner.  The receiver of the gift has thoroughly enjoyed the boxed set.
B000056HE9|5.0|This is an old movie with Loretta Young and Cary Grant. So if you like old movies with great actors this Christmas movie is the one.
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|I hadn't heard of Elbow before hearing an \\"OMG who is THAT?\\" song on XM radio. That initiation (Grounds for Divorce) sent me on a treasure hunt, and I found the \\"Seldom Seen Kid\\" at the end of the rainbow. What a great purchase. I've listened to it several times through now, and am knocked breathless by the beauty and creativity in every track (make room, Lennon and McCartney). These songs have amazing range, sly lyrics, and sheer, gorgeous, soul-filling arrangements. I thought at first that I might not care for a couple of pieces that were a bit \\"lounge\\" until I stopped and gave my attention to them. They did not fit into the box I had constructed for them, and now I am helplessly and happily tangled in the overflow. Elbow flies high, and they share their Pegasus pills with those of us who pause to listen. There is such a range of sound on this shimmering disc that I expect every listener will find at least a few songs to be grateful for.
B000MRAAJW|1.0|I didn't realize that you needed a special DVD player for this movie.  It was a Christmas gift, so my nephew didn't get to watch see it.  He has a HD DVD player, but it couldn't read this video.  I had to return this, I am still waiting for a credit, and purchase a different version.  What a pain.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|I almost always enjoy anything Batman, being a fan from childhood, many years ago.  This film of course has some bitter sweet points to it, with the death of the star of the film.  There are parts to this film that makes it a bit too realistic and removes the viewer from the 'fantasy' film.   Many lines are truely believable as being the Joker's reason for his scars. It's not too far from what we hear on the news these days.  Alfred's line, 'some people just like to see the world burn', is very striking and true. Probably the strongest line of wisdom he has ever given.  In one scene, after the explosion of a building, it is very reminescent of the scenes from the WTC.  Parts of this film strike a little too close to reality.  Still, a very good film.  For me, not worth all the hype, but I do look forward to the next and hopefully they won't all be ruined like the last several Batman movies.

1401219268|4.0|Let me start by saying that this is an incredible piece of work, I have never read any comic thats similar. The storyline is orginal, follows the politics throughout the ages of the Watchmen, and the end is what you never expect. The artwork is pretty good as well considering the book was released in 1985. If you liked V for Vendetta (the comic book or film) you will definetly enjoy this piece by author Alan Moore. Finally if you want to just bone up on what Watchmen is before the film comes out in March, you will know everything about the film so don't pick up this book unless you wanna know all the spoilers.
B000006045|5.0|Personally my favorite Massive Attack album.  Interesting lyrics layered over mesmerizing bass and moody beats.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|You can bet money on anything coming out of the Whedon stable to be a winner and Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog does not disappoint.  So much fun and the extra clips from fans are winners all by themselves.  You can't have this much fun for the price any where else and it just keeps the laughs up every time you watch it.  Looking forward to Dollhouse Friday Feb 13, the new show from Joss on Fox.
B000HIVOI2|1.0|This was a huge disappointment as I love this movie and it should have come alive with a real Blu-ray conversion.  Unfortunately the studio must have taken the ultimate quick-and-dirty get it out fast approach.  Honestly, my original DVD is better than this \\"Blu-ray\\".  In fact, my copy does not even have the sub-titles when they are talking in the ancient language.  I ended up translating for my audience.  I have also decided not to buy another Blu-ray from Lionsgate unless I see a solid review first.
B001G9LVGG|4.0|This is a Christmas album unlike most other Christmas albums. Even the best, and there are many that are not the best, tend to pull one through the feelings of Christmas quickly, with one good song after another. We hear one song of Christmas and want to hear the next. All that is well and good but not precisely the way to approach this work. Although it is a combination of an earlier short album and newly recorded works it all fits together in a rather different way. Each of these songs seems to want to be listened to by itself and then heard again and then thought about and heard yet again. To run through all the songs in one determined rush doesn't seem to be what this album is about.  You probably won't be interested at all in this collection unless you know and appreciate Loreena McKennitt's approach to music and this has all the hallmarks you would expect. Complex but spare arrangements, intense but thoughful vocalizing, great respect for creative sources are all present in the \\"new Celtic\\" influenced approach to English, French and Latin texts.   Just don't rush through this.
0439023483|5.0|I was recommended this book from someone who had also just finished the Twilight saga and had to fill the void in their life haha. At first I was reluctant to read The Hunger Games but I bought it anyway and seriously could not put it down! It's absolutely fantastic. No vampires or anything but it's a great read! Definitely more mature.
B001EYGOG0|5.0|The best combination of jazz and the holidays. Uplifting music to make the holidays swing.
B0015OKWL2|5.0|Unlike several of the previous reviews, I liked the film very much for several reasons.  First, it pairs two of the very best and versatile actors in the business, Pacino and DeNiro, along with super supporting actor, Brian Denehy.  Secondly, it deals with a subject that appeals, in fantasy, with emotions shared by a large segment of our society, retribution for heinous crimes but unfulfilled because of the often unfair legal system.  This film harkens back to the popular DEATH WISH series of the '70's and '80's starring the great Charles Bronson in which he, too, became a vigilante due to the dubious legal system.    Sure, there are some weak plot details, but that exists in many of the greatest films of yesterday and today and in the end we rate films for a great number of things not the least of which is great acting which does not dissappoint here.   For the most part, the film leads you in one direction and many surprises occur along the way.   All in all, take it for what it is:  a pairing of three great actors, lots of action, a sympathetic theme and many surprises.  I hope this will not be the last pairing of this dynamic duo.
B001GKJ2DE|4.0|Like I said, good. Simple story with a little twist. I grab this one for Angelina Jolie. Just like Tomb Raider, I like her doing action flix. The action sequence, though not realistic is great-almost anime-like. I give it 4 stars because it could have a better story content.
B001GZ6QEC|1.0|Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker was OUTSTANDING; no one else will ever be able to get it right after him.  Other than that, the movie was about an hour and a half too long and more than a little boring - I actually fell asleep a couple of times.  I like Christian Bale as Batman except for his Batman voice, which annoyingly sounded like he'd been eating rusty nails.  Hopefully, next time, they'll shorten it a little...absolutely no reason for a movie like this to be 3 hours long!
B001GJOL22|5.0|Yes, this probably is one of those must-own concert videos. The detail is great and the camera work is even better. You get to see a lot of the functioning of a live band that many concert videos leave out.    The performance is great, too. The late-middle section does get a little long, but overall it's really good. Few bands can perform as well live as they do on recording (after many multi-track takes being edited like mad), but Rush is one that can (another is Pink Floyd).    The only nit-picking I have is the box. It's not the standard plastic container but a cardboard rendition. It may be more environmentally correct, but I don't like it. Small item that shouldn't discourage getting this movie.
0312370849|5.0|This is the most poignant, intriguing, heartfelt, historic, novel I've ever read.   I couldn't put it down.   The indignities the French imposed on the Jews were indescribable.  It is another shameful history lesson that we should never forget.
B00168OINK|3.0|We thoroughly enjoyed the film pictures in 1080p blu ray.   But the story is yet another constant action film with little content.   Our mothers would not allow the grandkids ages 6-8 to watch it.   Especially the boys for belief that they would be acting out kung fu for the next week.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My husband received this game as a Christmas present and we have played it several times.  It is a game that you have to think through and has a little bit of chance involved in it.  You need to be prepared in case the throw of the dice brings a robber to your property and takes things from you.  Overall, it is a great family game, we enjoy it more than all of the other \\"typical board games\\" and it changes with each play.  You will definitely enjoy this game if you purchase it!
B0019X3YXM|4.0|Never saw the original.  Don't care.    I watched this movie like 4 or 5 times on a cruise to the Carribean last week... and I loved it... and I'm a guy.    Its a great vehicle for Cuthbert, allowing her to act and not be just another pretty Maxim magazine pinup.  She dominates the screen... and the male lead is subdued enough to allow her to intoxicate his world with what at first appears to be her Free Spirit wild-child ways.    Those that can't stand her Bi-polar-ish actions ...need to hang in there, ALL will be revealed.  The character of Jordan Roark is much deeper than that of spoiled little rich girl.  My wife couldn't hardly stand the character and was ready to give up on the movie... but I told her \\"Trust me, you're going to like the ending.\\"   For guys, Elisha Cuthbert is so beautiful  and spunky and so full of life...well, what's not to love?     There are not one...but TWO payoffs at the end for those that do stick with it, Jordan's story...and one really great kiss.  After you learn Jordan's story... you'll want to go back and watch the movie again and pick up all the little nuances of the movie that make a second watching much more enjoyable.     One superb quality to this movie is that its actually pretty clean,,, and would make an excellent first date type movie for a young couple.  I wouldn't mind watching this one with the kids either, only a small bit of bad language
0956010903|5.0|This edition was more amazing than anything I could have imagined.  It is bigger than I thought as well.  Opening the leather box, then the bag, and finding a beautiful leather Tales of Beedle the Bard with a metal skull and clasp made the price well worth it.  Tucked inside the leather box in an envelope are illustrations from the book.  Every true Harry Potter fan must have it.  Thank you, Amazon, for providing a treasure.
159102594X|5.0|Buy it NOW! Great people with wonderful names and heartwarming characteristics are vividly displayed. The dialogue is witty, sharp and thoughtful with just a pinch of irreverance thrown in to spice it up. I put all else aside so I could devour the trilogy.

Kids get off on the animation, Guys get off on the mechanic and explosions, and Gals get off on the love story that's in the movie. Of course...? I guess anybody could love/like all three points of the movie as well.  :-)<br /><br />Excellent visual story line (very little talking in 1st. half of movie). 2nd. half of movies (the talking part) comes together to answer questions in first half. (Sorry, I'm not going to tell you the movie).<br /><br />But this is a movie that I think you should add to your library.
0316017922|5.0|Outliers is Malcolm Gladwell doing what he does best. He takes on a subject, in this case it's \\"success.\\" He presents a series of views of the subject, where he serves up some interesting research, and a story or two.<br /><br />Then he links up the different views with a red thread or two made up of his own insights. In this case that red thread is \\"there's more to success than being smart or talented.\\" He wraps the thread around several success factors: talent; focused hard work; culture, coaching; and support.<br /><br />Gladwell's main insight is not a new one. Researchers have known for years that talent or intelligence alone are not enough to guarantee success. Common sense supports it. Jokesters were onto it when they came up with the old line: \\"If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?\\"<br /><br />There's really nothing strikingly new here. But the message of the book is still important. It's important because the two major belief systems of our age present much more simplistic pictures.<br /><br />One belief system holds that talent is what rules the roost. If you're talented, then success can be yours. You have won the Genetic Lottery and all that's left is reaping the rewards.<br /><br />The other belief system holds that you can do anything you want. With the right mental attitude, there are no limitations.<br /><br />The great value of this book is that it demonstrates that both those ideas are simplistic nonsense. Success is more multi-faceted than either.<br /><br />Let me pause here for a moment. If what you seek in a book like this one is a flashing new insight or if you want academic rigor and depth in the research, don't bother to buy the book. It's not for you.<br /><br />If you're looking for a quick fix or a step-by-step method to achieve success, give this one a pass. It's not for you.<br /><br />If you're looking for a book that will challenge some of your thinking about what goes into success, this is a worthwhile read. If you're seeking fresh ways to think about how success happens in your life, the lives of your loved ones and friends, and the lives of people you work with, this will be a book that you'll like.<br /><br />Outliers won't give you a step-by-step plan for achieving success or helping your children or team members achieve it. But it will give you a framework for thinking about different drivers of success. It will give you ideas for doing something about the things that you can control.<br /><br />Here's my bottom line. Don't buy Outliers if you want a quick success method, insights no one has had before, or deep academic research and reasoning. Do buy Outliers if you want a well-written book that will help you consider success in new and helpful ways.of your loved ones and friends, and the lives of people you work with, this will be a book that you'll like.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|Though it's tempting to enter into all the background debate about Metallica for the last 15 years, I fear this is a hopeless endeavor, so I'll instead ignore that altogether, and only consider the material at hand.<br /><br />\\"Death Magnetic\\" is precisely the sort of album you would expect an incredibly successful, veteran band to release at this point. It is a solid, professional effort that largely draws from past glories, albeit with a slightly different flavor, at times. The effect is similar to that of the more recent Iron Maiden releases - it's not precisely identical to their classic material, and it is perhaps a bit stodgy and longwinded at times, but it is still an interesting, carefully crafted release that is filled with good, but rarely truly great material. We'd all love another \\"Master of Puppets\\", of course, but that's not a practical expectation anymore. Indeed, it would surely be impossible to create a new thrash album with that kind of impact, because we've simply heard too much. Still, while Metallica may not have the ambition and innovation of their youth, the riff- and songwriting they developed over the years remain, and they can no doubt continue to craft entertaining metal records for years to come, if they so desire.<br /><br />The big question surrounding \\"Death Magnetic\\" was, \\"Would it be a thrash record?\\" Surely everyone has heard at least some by this point, but I'll answer anyway: Yeah, more or less. It's not a pure revival of the 80s, however: there are more than a few southern, bluesy licks (End of the Line, Broken, Beat & Scarred), a bit of Black album polish and atmosphere along with one substantial retread of \\"St. Anger\\" (Cyanide). The album does indeed revive the progressive songwriting to some degree, though this is both a strength and a weakness. Though I like the longer tracks in theory, here they don't have quite the consistently strong riffwriting found earlier. Thus, the better thrash tracks are actually the shorter ones, particularly \\"That Was Just Your Life\\" and \\"My Apocalypse,\\" which replicate the sharp, piercing thrash of \\"And Justice For All\\" and the bludgeoning triplets of \\"Battery\\", respectively, and both include some catchy, rapid fire vox on Hetfield's part. (\\"That Was. . .\\" also features some particularly shredding leads from Hammett, who is in fine form throughout.) This straight up thrashers are terrific, easily the best material here, but I also find some of the less conventionally thrashy tracks particularly effective, such as the southern-fried groove-thrash of \\"Broken, Beat & Scarred\\" and the raw pounding assult of \\"Cyanide,\\" both of which are undeniably driving and catchy. Finally, the sludgy, sleazy riffage of \\"Suicide & Redemption\\" is quite unexpected and generally effective, if not quite astounding.<br /><br />Still, some of the material is a bit uneven, even if there are no obvious throwaway tracks. \\"The Unforgiven III\\" in particular, is quite unremarkable, though it proves valuable simply as a change of pace. Again, the trouble comes with the more epic tracks, which tend to be a mix of the excellent (the riffing in \\"All Nightmare Long\\", the scorching instrumental close of \\"The Day That Never Comes\\", the vox of \\"Judas Kiss\\") and the decent but unremarkable (the opening half of \\"Day\\", the vox on \\"All Nighmare Long,\\" the blues riffs of \\"End of the Line\\" and general riffing in \\"Judas Kiss\\".) These songs are still good, but 8 minute thrashers shouldn't just be good, they should be awesome. (Alright, the close of \\"Day\\" is sweet enough that is qualifies as awesome, but the others don't). They might've been better bloating the shorter opener and closers into the epics, though they would've lost their immediacy. In the end, \\"Death Magnetic\\" suffers from a flaw common to expensive, major release - it's just too long, as is pretty much every 75 minute metal release. This may sound contradictory (If all the material is good, why cut it?), but, after time, a lot of good but not great material can have a numbing effect, and can distract from the strongest moments.<br /><br />However, this review is probably sounding over critical. Again, while there isn't a lot of mind blowing material, there is a lot to like, and it is truly gratifying to here Metallica write a more conventionally metallic record, and here they sound uniformly tight and energetic. Still, don't be hoping for another \\"Ride the Lightning,\\" cause it's almost certainly never coming.ave a numbing effect, and can distract from the strongest moments.

B000FUTQ8C|2.0|This was my first foray into the works of Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson (I haven't read the other books in this series), and perhaps my expectations were too high, because I was very disappointed. \\"Battle of Corrin\\" reads like an exceptionally dry history textbook -- \\"character A traveled to this place, character B attacked that place\\" -- with character development so cursory that it can hardly even be called two-dimensional. The players in the book keep performing actions that are either so maladroit, or so at odds with their own personalities, that eventually it becomes impossible for the reader to suspend disbelief. Nothing makes sense and there is no sense of underlying intrigue or development to keep the reader motivated. About halfway through the book I resigned myself to skimming through the remainder to look for any interesting snippets. I wish I could say something more positive -- it would've been wonderful to have a compelling successor (or in this case prequel). I do applaud the authors for having a go at what would have really been a monumental writing task for anyone.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|The Phantom of the Opera starring Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum is absolutely fantastic for those who love musical dramas.  It is a period piece so the costumes and sets flow beautifully.  If you love the stage, if you love musicals, if you love dramas, then you will love this movie... like the title of this review said, it is a great drama with wonderful music.  You will not be disappointed.
B001F7MSFM|4.0|OK, this is not a great movie, but it's fairly entertaining and the sets and costumes are fabulous. There's less wry humor than in the first Hellboy movie, but it's still there and that's good. Hellboy II holds your interest as the (fairly predictable) storyline unfolds, without taking itself too seriously. I gave it 4 stars, but it's really more like 3.5 or thereabout.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|At last a package with all the blade runner editions. I was looking for the theatrical version in DVD for six years. I watched the theatrical version in VHS in early's 90's and wanted to watch it again. I had the director cut in DVD also but this package has all the editions I know about this movie. I liked a lot the final cut and it was very nice to see the theatrical edition again.   Now, Blade Runner is one of the best science fiction movies ever, so if you still don't have it, this is the package you should choose.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I have seen this now 6 times.  I find it very invigorating.  The cast is wonderfully funny.
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|I'm an ABBA fan.  I bought the soundtrack to the musical before, but something about the sound or tone of songs made me not like it. I disliked it so much, I had to sell it off.  Didn't even want it in my music library.    So here comes the movie production.  It didn't excite me much because, so far, many of the movie adaptations have fallen flat.    I finally watch the video months later after it is released, and find myself enjoying it.  Enough to keep going, rather than be turned off by some of the earlier, contrived musiscal numbers.  In the end, it was not just a smile here, a memory there (what with the ABBA songs) but a few days later, I am still thinking about the songs and the scenes they went with.  I'd have to say, get a chance to watch it if you can.    Now as for the movie itself, I felt like Evita, Phantom of the Opera, and Mamma  Mia movies suffered from the same problem.  This problem is that, the singing doesn't seem like part of the movie.  Breaking out in dance and musical choreography is something I can accept with no issue, but the singing parts feel like they are dubbed in at the studio to have higher sound quality.  As a result, the talking scenes seem so mellow and are only intended to lead into the song numbers, which then take over your sound system with full orchestra and loudness and clarity.  It takes away from feeling like the characters are really singing the song as part of the movie, but rather, you are watching an MTV music video.    Short of this, \\"Mamma Mia\\" made me think about all the ABBA songs I liked, during and days after watching it.  I think Colin Firth sang the best out of the all guys, but I liked them all.
B001B9N6LO|4.0|My three year old son has a lot of fun with this garage. There is a lot of space for his little cars. They either can enter the garage through the ramp or with the elevator, they can be washed and can get fuel at the gas station on the floor of the garage. The durability of the elevator is not so convinicing. It did not go to the ground completely any more after some days of intense playing.
B0006Z2LH4|2.0|Ok. If you like to have endings to your films and like some sort of logic in your films then this Cube isn't for you. If you like open-ended films and don't want to know why things work and how it ends, then it might be to your liking.    This was better than Cube2. But that's not saying much. I agree with another poster that the scenes in the cube look more professional and the ones outside the cube look for Sci-fi Channel movie like. Which is bad.    I also like to see the little guys win so that is another reason why I disliked Cube3 and Cube2. I can't remember Cube1.    The special effects are decent. And that's the only good thing.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|At first I was skeptical about a movie with very little dialogue, hell I didn't even see it in theaters, because I thought it was going to be a stupid kid's movie and I accidentally saw it during the holidays when by younger cousins came over and I was wrong. The film plays out like a Chaplin movie (Gold Rush) as in the lovable loser falls for the cold and distant person,this case a robot and eventually the love is reciprocated, yeah it's like that, but crossed with 200l: A Space Odyssey. The film is about a lone robot: Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class (WALLE)who looks like the offspring of Johnny Five and a trash compacter cleaning up the earth in the future after a Wal-martesque corporation run by Fred Willard takes over the planet and runs it into the ground. Walle after 700 years alone evolves a personality and watches the hell out of Hello Dolly and he gets lonely and wants love.<br />* This movie has tons of extras for both film geeks and kids.<br />* Note: the DVD box is unique and not the standard 7 3/8In. by 5 3/8In for those that whine about that sort of thing, also its left and right side slide out oppose to opening like a book.<br />* The movie is a hybrid of live action and top CG animation.

B001IQ5MNK|2.0|As a story it was very poorly spun and was much worse on rendering it. I agree there are a few good observations in the story.Other than that, not a lot to appreciate as much as i would like to.<br /><br />My disappointment primarily stems from the fact that objective of this book either did not come out very well or it was too thinly spread or got digressed more on other facets.<br /><br />Also, in my opinion, it also conveys a wrong impression to outsiders (Non-indians) about the country. Incidents observed/narrated in this book are exceptions and are not the rules. I would think these darker sides of countries are not unique to india and has roots in other countries too.<br /><br />I only wish, some of these things were atleast put in perspective for the neutral readers to get it right.

B001FBSMW6|5.0|The band has not rested on their laurels, but went for a challenge. And succeeded. It's pop, but \\"Keane pop\\" - intelligent, unique, thought-provoking and soaked with emotion.     The first time I listened to the CD, I was in complete shock. Up until the last song, Tom's voice was the only Keane sound I seemed to recognize. By the time the CD had started Spiralling for a second time though, I was hooked. The new album is Keane for happier days. And the essence of Keane is still there - all that passion and raw emotion from H&F and UTIS - as strong as ever and now channeled as an infectious good mood. The melodies, the choruses, the amazing vocals, the meaningful lyrics are stronger than ever. Have not stopped listening to the CD since I got it two months ago.       So when are they coming to the US? I can't wait to hear the songs live!

1594201927|4.0|This is a 20,000-foot history of the global financial system (money, banks, corporations, insurance companies, hedge funds, etc.), with some diverting extras such as the origins of the Andes and of the game of Monopoly. Complex details and situations are conveyed in terms the average reader should be able to understand. I found the book interesting and eminently readable.<br /><br /> But do not expect a comprehensive explanation of the current turmoil in global financial markets, complete with a game plan for getting things back on track.  Mr. Ferguson may have some ideas about what needs to be done, as many of us do, but offering solutions is not the point of the book.<br /><br />Financial systems have come a long way since the clay tablets that served as a form of money in ancient Babylon.  The author portrays the development of these systems as playing a key and generally constructive role in the progress of the human race - meeting individual needs, undertaking ever larger-scale and more sophisticated activities, and determining the winners in inter-group competitions (peaceful or otherwise).  If anything, I would say Ferguson overstates the case, seeing innovations in finance as driving progress in other areas when it could be the other way around.<br /><br />As is also explained, financial systems are complex, interactive, and dependent on confidence that things will work as expected.

B000P12LWY|1.0|I was fortunate enough to travel to Britain this past summer and while there I visited the Mary Rose Museum in Portsmouth. (For anyone who doesn't remember this mention in the DVD series, the Mary Rose was Henry's favorite ship.) The museum contained fascinating artifacts from the ship (and even the ship itself) and also provided interesting facts about Henry and his life while on the high seas. Aside from this outing, I believe I have a basic knowledge of this monarch's life and family.    (For example, repeat this little ditty to remember Henry's wives: \\"Divorced, beheaded, died; divorced, beheaded, survived.\\" But I digress.)    When my sister raved about this series and lent me her DVD set the first thing I said was, \\"But Henry didn't look anything like that.\\" I tried to get past the leering gaze of JRM on the DVD cover, thinking, okay -- Showtime just wanted the cast to be easy on the eyes.    If only.    I can't understand why (obviously) so much money was spent on cast and costumes when Showtime's intent was to take about 10% of real history and pool it with 90% of insulting inaccuracies? Creative license (e.g., hair coloring) could be tolerable but this series is nothing short of a mess. An extravagant production that left me disgusted and bored.     I guess my sister and I have something else to disagree about. ;-)

B0016Q2D5M|2.0|Yes Fraser's last decent movie was the Mummy (first one).  This just adds to the list of stupid films he has been in unfortunately.  The situations went from crazy mine shaft rides that rival Warner Brothers cartoons, to the director failing to catch someone's chest strap on their backpack unhitched in a rough climb. . . . But who is looking for stuff like that?    Its silly incredible (and I do mean that literally) chase scenes lent to the comedy for me because it truly was closer to a cartoon than a movie.  Temperatures rising to 115 and not a bead of sweat on anyone's skin?  Come on!  Even a light coating of vaseline would have done the trick, they didn't even have the budget for that?    I guess if it was 3-D then it didn't matter.  But it certainly left me unfulfilled.  I wouldn't recommend it, unless I wanted to dumb down someone's kid.  Read the book instead.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|Wow, what a terrific show...so many great talents when they were young, and high quality recordings. My grown kids came over while I was watching and asked what they called this kind of show (variety?) and why they don't make shows like them any more!

B00005JO9J|5.0|i absolutely loved Grey's it was fabulous to see it from the beginning again.  I actually sat down and watched the whole season over 2 days and could not tear myself away.  It is a great show and i will endeavour to wait and see if i can get the other seasons.  well done.
B000VNMMQQ|5.0|this is a very good action movie! i like it because there is almost no scean with out action. it is somewhat funny!
B000002KFJ|4.0|...and I will have to go with the people who think this is a necessary Sabbath album. Side one is basically why heavy metal exists at all, for better or worse. So you get it for that. Also contains the worst song from them I have ever heard, \\"Supertzar\\". Every record has a clunker, so that notwithstanding, the whole record gets a thumbs up from me.
B001GKJ2E8|4.0|My daughter who works in a movie theater watched this movie at her work.  When she came home she told me that this movie and Twilight were the 2 movies that she wanted for her birthday.  I watched it and thought it was ok, not bad, but not a \\"had to have\\" kind of movie.  I do however base movies on the fact that I know I will have to watch them a lot (because of my kids)  This one I can...My daughter on the other hand would totally disagree with me.  She loves the movie, but loves Angelina too...Hope that helps.

1573921394|4.0|Keynes published his General Theory in 1936, when the economies of the U.S. and the rest of the Western world were still mired in the Great Depression following the stock market crash of 1929 (through which Keynes himself lost a fortune). Since Keynes writes in a formal style to address classical economists of his generation some 75 years ago, readers today will find his language somewhat dated, unfamiliar and even tedious to follow; however, for serious students of economic thought and financial history, this groundbreaking work is required reading, for it is THE seminal treatise for what has become the lengthy tradition of so-called Keynesian economic policy, which counts among its adherents administrations spanning the decades from FDR's New Deal in the 1930s to Obama's program for \\"The Change We Need,\\" coming our way this Inauguration Day, January 20, 2009.    Theorists of any discipline will appreciate the precision and intellectual honesty with which Keynes carefully spells out the assumptions forming the basis of his revolutionary framework for understanding macroeconomics.  While 19th century classical economists assumed a system in equilibrium with effectively a single level of employment at some rate of interest, Keynes's General Theory purports to explain the workings and inter-relationships of the critical components of our real-world economy--output, employment, consumption and investment--and their dependence on our propensity to consume, the schedule of marginal efficiency of capital and the market rate of interest, and in turn on psychological factors, wage bargaining and the quantity of money, all in a broader formulation encompassing a wide range of economic conditions from depression-era unemployment to the elusive ideal of full employment.    Today, with our economy in the throes of an increasingly virulent recession that began with the seemingly innocuous subprime mortgage problem in the U.S. in the summer of 2007, we can only wonder what adviceKeynes would give us if he were still alive today.  The following passage from the book provides some insight:  \\"We reach a condition where there is a shortage of houses, but where nevertheless no one can afford to live in the houses that there are. . . . [T]he remedy for the boom is not a higher rate of interest but a lower rate of interest!  For that may enable the so-called boom to last.  The right remedy for the trade [business] cycle is not to be found in abolishing booms and thus keeping us permanently in a semi-slump; but in abolishing slumps and thus keeping us permanently in a quasi-boom.\\" (Ch. 22)    Throughout the course of history, there has never been an economy operating for any extended period of time in a continuous state of full employment, in which all people who wish to work can find suitable jobs.  Instead, the unfortunate reality is that the U.S. and other economies have repeatedly suffered through undesirable recessions, many somewhat benign but others as damaging as the present one.  Seeing that the Fed raised rates from 1% to 5% in 2004-2006 due to concerns about a possible housing bubble and onset of inflation, Keynes might argue that rates were raised too rapidly and too high, thereby prematurely ending the boom and inadvertently exacerbating the present slump of 2007-2009, which has become so severe that even reduction of the targeted Fed Funds rate for the first time in history to its absolute lower limit of 0% has, as yet, failed to restore economic growth.    Being Keynesians, Ben Bernanke, Timothy Geithner and the incoming Obama administration will presumably utilize all of the monetary (keeping rates low, purchasing open-market debt, etc.) and fiscal (stimulus packages, tax cuts, etc.) \\"control knobs\\" available to policymakers to jump-start the economy.  If Keynes is right, in principle, our basic problem is that both investment and consumption have never, even during boom periods, been high enough to deliver the optimally high levelof output available through full employment.  Only when we have overcome the twin problems of under-investment and under-consumption--i.e., when borrowing rates fall low enough to allow more businesses to finance their operations, employ workers, and turn a profit, and when the workers, in their role as consumers, have adequate income and consume enough goods and services to drive the economy to full employment--only in such circumstances, according to Keynes, should policymakers ever need to think about raising interest rates to counteract price inflation that could follow.    Where will the $700 billion being spent on bailing out financial institutions, targeted zero-rate policy, and nearly $1 trillion upcoming stimulus package aimed at creating 4 million jobs leave us in 2010 and beyond?  Will we ever achieve the full-employment level that Keynes believed possible through appropriate government intervention in an otherwise private economy?  Particularly in the inexact science of economics, theory must patiently await verification by clumsy and imperfect real-world trial and error.  As participants with a vested interest in the ultimate outcome of what is without question the largest Keynesian experiment ever, let's all pray that the Keynesian full-employment ideal is more than a mere \\"visionary hope,\\" that when the fog lifts Keynes will continue to be revered as more than \\"some academic scribbler,\\" that our incumbent policymakers are not \\"madmen in authority,\\" and that we, the people--wearing our many hats as workers, consumers, investors and citizens alike--are more than \\"the slaves of some defunct economist.\\" (Keynes's phrases in quotes, from Ch. 24)

B001DHXT6G|3.0|First the good... The new and updated effects are awesome.  I have always enjoyed the show and now even enjoy it more.  Five Stars to Star Trek.  To me, the Original Series will always get a Five Star rating, no matter the format.  Star Trek is Star Trek no matter what.  Also, the new effects are even more fun if watching on a HD-LCD TV.  WOW!  Now the bad and why the rating is not Five Star...First, the packing is, as a whole, a JOKE.  The much maligned packaging, breaks just by looking at it.  I opened mine up and got some little pieces in my lap. Puts a new whole meaning to the words Fragile or Handle With Care.  The only saving grace was that my discs were not damaged or it would have been returned.  Second, no episode guides and finally, the price...  I noticed that the price has gone UP from when I purchased the set.   Well, there it is, Five Stars to Star Trek, One Star to company who released it.  Also Five Stars to Amazon for quick delivery, but then that goes without saying.  Have dealt with Amazon along time and never had any issues.
B001EOQWFI|4.0|This movie is funny, but very sad in the fact that the storyline could actually be a reality some day in the future.  Kids love it, and it's even worth watching if you don't have kids.
031606792X|3.0|The story of the fourth book was constructed as as well as in the first three ones - of course the novelty of for example battles among vampires, the speed or relations between Indians and vampires was less strong but new insights in relationships, the BIG surprise (not wanting to spoil the fun of those who haven't read the 4th book yet) etc. was there as strong as ever. Have read the first three in French translation - the fourth now in English - felt no break - bravo for the translation.

1439102813|5.0|Alice is young, smart and fully enjoying life after children when she is diagnosed early-onset Alzheimer's. With her beautiful writing and clearly well researched story, Lisa puts you by Alice's side, evoking the full rollercoaster of emotions she experiences from the moment she realizes something is wrong through her journey into dementia.    Alice is smart, tough, brave, but at the core of it a wife, mother and simply a woman afraid of losing herself, yet discovering more fully who that is as a result of her disease.     I read this book in one day and enjoyed it immensely! I hope Lisa continues to write. I'll certainly continue to read her work!
0525951113|4.0|If you're a gamer, or a geek, or simply fascinated (or scared!) about what networked technology is doing to society and business, this book is for you. Or at least the first 80% is; the last 20% may or may not be. Daniel Suarez has constructed a tight, l33t cutting-edge techno-thriller with a premise that's hard to disagree with: we are now so dependent on technology that the consequences of its manipulation are almost limitless. Control information, and you control money, and then people. Philosophers and the religious reject the possibility of artificial intelligence and claim that computers will never duplicate human experience; they overlook the fact that for many a good-enough simulation is better than a messy reality, and few people really care to tell them apart anyway.<br /><br />Suarez leads us into his world step by step, using plausible extensions of familiar technologies: cell phones, GPS, intruder detection system, videogames, WiFi, RFID badges. Individually the changes have been previsioned by TV shows or Wired magazine; collectively they have a plausible and sobering power. We remember Ferris Bueller changing his school grades all those years ago, and it's \\"trivially obvious\\" that it would be easy to engineer the release from prison of an otherwise unremarkable criminal. And after watching \\"Masters of the Universe\\" destroying prestigious financial companies with a few keystrokes, we accept that a modern corporation could be blackmailed and co-opted over the Internet.<br /><br />The first 80% of the book is excellent: exciting, terrifying, inexorable, and mind-stretching. There's a collection of satisfyingly-complex characters, good and bad, and Suarez orchestrates them very nicely. And we keep reading, because we want to know: how will it all turn out? Will the bad guys transform society into a Matrix-like shell, or will the contingency and serendipity of reality disrupt the best laid plans of cyber-mice and undead men?<br /><br />I'm not going to provide any spoilers. What I will say is that I was disappointed with the resolution that Suarez chose. It's hard to tell if it was the way he always intended things to unfold, or whether he simply couldn't figure out a good ending and took the easy way out.<br /><br />So a five star book with a two star ending. I'll give it four, because I did enjoy most of it.<br /><br />UPDATE: A couple of days ago, Daniel Suarez came to Amazon to talk about \\"Daemon\\", and I asked him about the \\"resolution\\" issue. Originally the novel was much longer - well over 1,000 pages - and it was rejected by one publisher after another. So Suarez chopped it into two parts, and self-published the first half as \\"Daemon\\". It was slow to take off, but eventually a number of tech-savvy pundits got wind of it and started a buzz, which led to it being picked up by the publishers Dutton (part of the Penguin empire).<br /><br />So what I interpreted as the \\"resolution\\" of the story is, in fact, \\"climax\\". To follow [[ASIN:0554432137 Freytag's]] classic analysis, \\"Daemon\\" is all \\"rising action\\": we have merely reached the apex of the \\"pyramid\\", and will have to wait for the second half of the story before we get to the resolution and d&eacute;nouement.<br /><br />And when will that be? Well, Dutton wants to follow the standard tempo of hardcover and paperback publication, so Suarez has plenty of time for polishing the sequel. Shucks.I will say is that I was disappointed with the resolution that Suarez chose.

B000NTPDSW|1.0|I purchased the Blue Ray treatment of this classic as a requested gift.  If you already own this on DVD save your money because the HD treatment is VERY poor.  Comparing my 5+ years old DVD version which has been watched at least 5 times with the 'NEW' BlueRay treatment I have to say neither offers a better picture -- and the improved picture is what I thought I was chasing.    Two stars because it is the Godfather.  Rating the upgrade alone I would give it one star.

0307388840|4.0|There were a lot of things I liked about this book; not the least was how the author drew believable characters and gave me so many reasons to identify with each one.  Young Briony, who loses herself in her fantasies, writing stories and plays to impress her family, particularly her older brother.  And her later experiences as a trainee nurse, writing in her her journal every day as the only way to preserve her individuality in her institutionalized life.  Her older sister Cecilia, agonizing over the few choices an independent woman has in 1930's Britain after college.  Robbie trying to understand where his relationship with the child Briony went wrong.  Somehow, McEwan turns what might have been a mundane tale in another writer's hands into a page turner.  His writing is smooth, detailed and evocative, but never feels overwritten.  he painstakingly constructs the viewpoints of various characters and de-constructs many miscommunications.  He keeps the drama taught--Briony witnesses a sexual assault and fingers a family friend as the perpetrator--yet keeps the right amount of humor present, such as when Robbie sends the *wrong* love note to Cecilia. Only the ending felt a bit out of place and contrived, if unexpected.  Highly recommended.
0765342294|4.0|Ender's Game is one of those oft-praised award winning books with a cult following, and I've been meaning to read it for years. Retrospectively, I wonder what sort of affect it might have had on me in middle-school or high-school. I liked it now, but I think I would have liked it even more then. As an adult, I found the most interesting aspect about this book to be the way it portrays leadership, and I could easily see some professor incorporating Ender's Game into a \\"leadership through literature\\" class alongside Henry V and The Odyssey. As a six-year-old living in a future US, Ender Wiggen is noticed for his inherited genius (shared by his siblings) and his potential to be developed and trained to become the next great commander to lead humans against an invading alien race. Ender is sent to the Battle School, an orbiting satellite/station with a special zero-gravity room where genius young soldiers-to-be practice tactics in a three-dimensional environment. The concept is brilliantly realized, as are the details of training and the Battle Room sequences themselves. The plot itself is well-paced and gripping. My main complaint is the lack of emotion and relationship between the characters and, when it does exist, it feels forced (Valentine & Ender's relationship). OSC did a better job fleshing out minor characters like Dink in the recent novella War of Gifts, letting them show real affection and human empathy for each other. The surprise \\"twist\\" at the end was good, but not that surprising, and the last 30 pages of so simply did not fit the story thus far and ground everything to a halt. Despite it's flaws, this is definitely worth your time.
0312427646|3.0|In my opinion, this novella didn't quite live up to the incredible reviews it has received (as a 25 year old, I don't think I quite fit the target age demographic, if that says anything).  I won't deny that the book was certainly good, but slightly duller and less \\"spoofy\\" than I had been led to believe.<br /><br />The titular \\"reader\\" of this book is none other than Queen Elizabeth II. One day she follows her barking Pekineses into a portable library, and ends up borrowing what turns out to be a barely tolerable book out of politeness (the author had been made a Dame of the Empire , so the Queen assumed it had to be good, since she had already done the honors...).  Luckily, the Queen's second book is a page turner, and thus she becomes an insatiable reader, to the dismay of the household, equerry, and the Duke.  There are some amusing tidbits here: the queen perfects the art of waving from a coach while hiding a book beneath the window.  She hires a homosexual kitchen boy--another patron of the portable library--to suggest new reads (some of the titles he suggests one would imagine to be quite shocking to a grandmotherly monarch).  It is obvious that the queen begins to think about her duty and her people in new ways as she is exposed to literature (which says much for the value of fiction), although I imagine that using a contemporary and very much alive public figure as the central character would prevent the author from trying anything drastic, unexpected, or *gasp* the least bit unflattering.  Which he doesn't.  An interesting premise, some humor, a very understated (borderline yawn-provoking) style, and nothing earthshaking.  Unlike the books the queen devours, I don't feel this one changed me all that much.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Anyone that is even aware of Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog already knows what they are getting into.  A fun musical built on a silly premise with a silly plot and silly characters.  The music is awesome, and the acting is fun.  Any fan of Joss Whedon's work will like this.    Your question is, I can see this for free, online, why should I pay for the DVD?  My answer is, because I want to see more stuff like this in the future.  I want to support writers that are willing to take a risk and are willing to try a new business model.  I haven't even watched all of the extras on the DVD and already consider the purchase worth it.    The movie itself is hilarious.  I also watched all of the applications for the Evil League of Evil that were included on the DVD.  There were a couple that were really great, and most that were annoying, or lame at best.  We started listening to the musical commentary, but with it being musical, you have to concentrate a bit to really tell what they are saying, and I wasn't in the mood to concentrate.  Lyrics would probably make that part more enjoyable.    If you got this far, you already know you want it and should just buy the DVD.  If you are on the fence, perhaps you should watch it for free on Hulu to see what all the hype is about, then come back and buy the disc to support an innovative writer.

B000CNESU8|4.0|While watching this film I couldn't help but wonder if our current talk radio d.j's had studied this film backwards and forwards.  Everything plays out like someone with a crystal ball and seeing where the future of news or rather tabloid news was headed in the seventies.  I thought Ms. Dunaway gave a pretty good performance but the whole side story line with Schumacher/Holden was un-necessary-though I thought Beatrice Straight's performance was pretty good.  My only problem was the last five minutes when the Network's plan to fix the ratings seemingly came out of nowhere.  Still, this is definitely a film work seeing.

I haven't listened to it for several days, but some of the tunes are still bouncing around in my skull, notably \\"Sing the Changes,\\" and \\"Don't Stop Running.\\" There's the trademark McCartney playfulness and essential optimism. His vocals have retained an impressive range, as evidenced by \\"Two Magpies.\\"    The package includes a booklet with McCartney artwork that was (apparently) inspired by the music.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|In this Bueller...Bueller... Edition, you get the great Ferris Bueller movie, plus great extras including an interview with Ben Stein with clips from the time the movie was made and how he feels about it today and how it has changed his life for the better.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Great Western.  Unbelievable variety of great stars.  The theme song continually plays in the background and stays with you long after the end of the movie.
0956010903|5.0|You simply can't go wrong with a book like this. Jo's fantastic imagination just continues to pour through in these short stories, and a much bigger task to write Dumbledore's little entry, seeing as she killed him off in the 6th book. Deathly Hollows makes many references to this book, only for you to find yourself even more happy with what this book has to offer.<br /><br />The creative genius ivested into this book will be cherished for years to come. You'll definitely want this passed on to your kids, and then to their kids, and then to their kids....
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|My daughter and I love this movie, even bought the soundtrack. We both like Abba songs and there were some songs on soundtrack and movie I have never heard of and now I am in love with these songs.
B001LRJH0U|4.0|I pre-ordered this dvd, mainly because Viggo Mortensen is one of my favorite actors.  This movie also had good reviews by the critics.  I was extremely impressed on just how good this movie really is.  This is a western about two men torn between the same woman.  I really don't like to tell too much about the movie in my reviews, but this is a definite must-see movie.  It is kind of long, but that is the only flaw.
B00127RAJY|3.0|Pretty boring exercises that usually make people give up after a month max just because it's not interesting. Nothing like Tae-Bo, which I do when I'm bored because it's actually FUN. I also don't like the \\"motivation\\" Jillian uses: \\"Don't you want a 6-pack? Don't you want to be hot! You have to torture yourself to get it!\\" Wow, that's ridiculous. People should be working out to get healthy and, most importantly, to have fun--or you might as well just not start because you'll never stick with it.
1439110123|5.0|The author does a wonderful job knitting the various relevant pieces of the story together into one cohesive narrative about oil and its impact on geopolitics, in addition to the obvious industrial and economic impacts.  also, the book is very clearly written and \\"light\\" and its chapters would breeze by without my notice.  would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in modern history and oil geopolitics...
B001GKJ2DO|1.0|My wife and I tried watching Mamma Mia.  We both love the music of ABBA since it was the music of our youth.  And the storyline seemed promising enough too.  It's a premise that reminds me of old time London stage comedies (the ones where misunderstandings and confused identities lead to unexpected and hilarious twists in the plot).  Well, we turned it off after 20 minutes.  When the characters aren't singing, it's dreadful.  The dialog is really over-the-top; some lines are screamed instead of spoken.  Each character has a different accent too.  It's tough on my ear and jarring to my brain to go from Scottish to American to Aussie to Euro English, all in the span of 15 seconds.  And so, I silently prayed for the next song to come in order to be put out of my misery.  The songs, as ABBA fans know, are classics.  But when one listens to the songs in the movie (which aren't sung by ABBA but rather by the actors), one thinks of how far superior the original versions are.  After 60 seconds of singing, one really appreciates how far superior the original versions are.  When the song is done, one realizes how far inferior these movie versions are!  Then it's back to mind-numbing dialog that is not at all witty or well-delivered ... just loud, annoying, and obnoxious.  Perhaps in the 21st minute of the film, the movie gets better, but who knows?  We never made it that far.  Instead, we put in the Fiddler on the Roof DVD and had a good time with Tevye and Tzeitel.
B001GM28HO|4.0|An interesting debut cd by the artist known as Lady GaGa.  With the obvious fav cut for me being \\"Just Dance\\".  I found myself liking a few other songs on the cd as well.  Well actually just about everyone except for Brown Eyes which i just couldn't get into at all.  Maybe I have to be in a different mood to enjoy but I don't see myself repeating that one too many times.  I thought that overall \\"The Fame\\" was more than good enough to warrant purchase and attention by anyone looking for some music that they can get down to and have fun with.  I look forward to her next effort after taking the plunge on this one.
0061808121|5.0|This audiobook production of To Kill a Mockingbird is phenomenal.  Spacek delivers a perfect audio performance.  She is such a skilled actor and provides a realistic and touching narration.  Her Southern accents are appropriate, believable, and add to the book's depth of feeling.  It is hard to imagine a better performance - one well deserving of this Pulitzer Prize winning book.  High School students studying this book for school may appreciate having an audiobook option for listening to this work.  Listeners of any age will feel right in the middle of this emotional, social drama.
B001ED7C58|4.0|I'm a HUGE Twilight fan, I've read all the books, seen the movie numerous times, so I couldn't wait to get this CD. For the most part I really like it.  I love \\"Flightless Bird\\" by Iron & Wine (it is the main reason I bought the CD).  The other songs are fun to listen to because they take you back to that particular seen in the movie.  The one dissappointment I have is that they didn't include Robert Pattinson's \\"Let me Sign\\". (Spoiler Alert) That is the song playing when Bella is dying and Edward is sucking the venom out.  This was a very powerful moment in the movie & it should have been included.  It's definitely a better choice then his other song \\"Never Think\\" which is only playing \\"in the background\\" when he takes her out to dinner.  Other then that....I would highly recommend this CD for any Twilight fan!
B00006WUWN|4.0|The Austin Powers series in a lot of ways is like the Waynes World films in that it defines a generation by pointing out its biggest personality traits and making fun of them. Waynes World pointed out the camp, moronic nature of many hardcore old school rock fans and their dedication for the genre. Austin Powers is a character that defines the campness of the groovy 60s, not necessarily hippie fashion, but more fun loving groovy cats who just wanted to have a good time.<br /><br />The character is broadly based around James bond and the velvet suit with Beatle Boots was actually worn by a George Lazenby incarnation of Bond. Mike Myers took his humour and expressed it in a character that worked on so many levels and took him to the sky in relation to recognition, and arguably the success of this particular will never be matched. With Austin Powers, Myers has now run the risk of the character becoming bigger than the actor and the humour itself. The catchphrases and groovy look are great and present a fun atmosphere, but this now runs the risk of the catchphrases overtaking any form of introduction of new humour.<br /><br />The character is no bad thing and the silly wit from the mind of Myers only helps the movies, but unless it was Myers intention, the character has now become bigger than its creator and it is obvious in this film. The story focuses around Austin who faces a new foe who teams up with Dr. Evil. The new foes name I hear you ask? Goldmember, and his criminal calling card is turning his victims members gold. Goldmember and Dr. Evil team up to build a tractor beam that will pull a meteor into the earth and melt the ice caps. Austin, with the help of a new companion by the name of Foxxy Cleopatra, has to travel back to 1975 to save his father and stop Dr. Evil and Goldmember.<br /><br />The plot's simple enough don't you think? I suppose what Myers sought to achieve with this was character progression more than anything as we see Dr. Evils son, Scott become evil. The new character of Goldmember is something not too appealing in the film, as it seems he's there to simply promote some form of \\"look how the foreigner talks funny\\" vibe, and the joke gets really old quite quickly. After about the first 5 minutes of being familiar with Goldmember, I think even Myers realised this character couldn't achieve anything better and after his original \\"comic\\" entrance he just ended up sitting in silence a lot.<br /><br />The real introductory gems of the entire film are Foxxy Cleopatra played by the devinely beautiful Beyonc&eacute; Knowles, and Nigel Powers played by the legendary Michael Caine who looks surprisingly young. Foxxy Cleopatra is the breath of fresh air in what generally is a redoing of all the old gags. She's a woman with talent and attitude and is like many women before her, after Austins heart. Michael Caine seems very much at home playing Nigel Powers as it seems a character very close to his own personality. The cheeky cockney geezer always up for a good time with the ladies is something very befitting of Caine.<br /><br />The setting is great and the comedy is just fantastic (the new stuff anyway) but I felt the movie fell short. Apart from the genuinely amazing intro and the odd bit here and there, the film just felt a lot like the previous two with a lot of the old gags done once again. Once is fantastic, twice is okay, but the same joke for the third time becomes a bit tiresome. I have to wonder that with a fourth installment in the works, just how soon will it be before Myers decides to drop the old boring jokes and create some new ones.er of Goldmember is something not too appealing in the film, as it seems he's there to simply promote some form of \\"look how the foreigner talks funny\\" vibe, and the joke gets really old quite quickly.

0066620996|3.0|Good to Great is a well-written book that tackles the question of how a mediocre company makes the leap to a great company and sustains that growth over the long run.  The book is based on an academic study of 11 companies who fit the \\"good to great\\" criteria of the author.  Collins and his team of researchers attempt to identify the traits that these 11 companies took on at the time of their transition.  To complete the study, similar companies that did not go from good to great were also researched as a control group.    The main problem I have with the book is the generality of the ideas.  There are only about three or four distinct things that separate the good and the bad companies according to Collins, and I never got the sense that any of them were fully explored.  The \\"hedgehog\\" and \\"flywheel\\" concepts in particular seem overly generalized.  I know that they were trying to be meticulous in their research and not list anything that was not present in all 11 companies, but surely there must have been a few other things that most of these companies had in common.    That being said, the chapter on \\"Level 5\\" leadership is an important lesson to learn about \\"celebrity CEOs\\", that the truly great CEOs are those who can build a company that will last long after they retire from its leadership.  For that chapter alone it is worth reading the book.    If you want a book on leadership, I highly recommend the works of Steven Covey and John C. Maxwell.

1574535811|5.0|We (Americans in general) are poisoning ourselves daily, one bite at a time. I have read many nutritional books (not faddish diet books) over the last fifteen years.  Many have good information.  Dr. Campbell's work is the best.  It not only explains what the scientific studies reveal, but how and why we are baffled by the BS that bombards us daily.  He covers both the politics and money behind that situation.<br /><br />I gave this book and the audio CD's as gifts this year.  Every person willing to open his/her eyes to better health through nutrition or in a dietary advisory role SHOULD READ THIS WORK.<br /><br />I am not a vegitarian, nor do I ever plan to be.  I have however changed my dietary habits and am lighter and stronger than ever.  I am also much surer of my health.  No more wondering if a tumor is lurking around somewhere.

0060899220|5.0|When I first picked this book up I expected to be reading a tame, slightly dumbed down version of Bourdain's life, this is the impression I get from his show and I was expecting the book to follow suit.  How wrong could I be?  It is completely off the hook and in your face, giving you a new respect for the men and women that cook your food.  I read this book in one day, which says something about the content, it usually takes a few days for me to get through something that is more than 300 pages.  I would recommend this book to anyone that has a tolerance for obscure and slightly graphic/racey things.
0061008079|5.0|A book that withstands the time. It is a book of inspiration and life as we know it. A lesson we can all learn about perseverance and attaining goals.
0385495323|5.0|This book does a really nice job tracing the history of cryptography and cryptanalyis (codemaking and codebreaking) through the ages. The author gives some high level overview of a code, a specific example and then some historical context for how a code was used. The level of detail is just right so that the average reader can understand the basic idea of a code but not be overwhelmed by the math.
B000000OTY|5.0|Extraordinario album.  Tal vez se oiga un ligero ruido en la grabacion (es de 1993!) pero no por eso deja de ser uno de los más extraordinarios conciertos que he escuchado.
B001LRJH0U|4.0|3 1/2 STAR's<br /><br />Enter a small town called, Appaloosa.  Rancher, Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) has just offed the Marshall and his two Deputies.  His rowdy band of cowhands pretty much run things, much to the chagrin of the local town folk---a fairly common western theme, to be sure.<br /><br />Predictably, new law comes to town, with Marshall Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and his Deputy, Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen). They are quick on the draw and ready to bring peace to Appaloosa, as well as a campaign to rid the town of the lawless Bragg. We begin the, 'don't bring your guns to town,' dialogue.<br /><br />Of course, we have to have a femme fatale, so we are introduced to Rene Zellweger's character Ali, who must exude plenty of pheromones, because all appear to be attracted to her flighty, self serving character.  Too much of the story begins to revolve around her. Since she is so integral to the plot, it would have helped to have a little more back-story on her. One was left to wonder why she ever wound up in a small town like Appaloosa, in the first place, when she was clearly a gal on a mission.<br /><br />Mortensen has the best performance, as the Deputy. There was good chemistry between he and Harris and their loyal friendship came to life.  However, there was scanty dialogue between them, with long pauses of, I suppose deep introspection. And, since the DVD transfer of this movie was so poor (audio and visual), it was hard to even hear those few words, since we had the addition of the old, cowboy mumbles. Even the gunshots sounded like cap pistols, with Zellweger's heels making almost as much noise walking the hardwood floors---and we had our surround system full-throttle.<br /><br />This western just wasn't gritty enough, or realistic enough for me and character development was lacking, resulting in a disconnect regarding their fates (except for Viggo...I always worry about him :-). Then with the DVD quality so poor, I couldn't even enjoy the best it had to offer.  Perhaps there will be an improvement with the Blu Ray version? Don't know, but I think I'd wait for it.  Sad really!  Good westerns come along so seldom, you have to wonder why they would compromise on the quality of the DVD.provement with the Blu Ray version? Don't know, but I think I'd wait for it.

B000MRAAJW|1.0|I am very unhappy with this product.  I purchased the set as a Christmas gift for my husband only to find that it would not play in out HD DVD player. There was no mention of the special viewing device needed. This product was returned & I purchased a different copy that does play for us.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|the usps lost my package and told me there was nothing they could do so i wound up spending way more $ to get in a store, after we bought it it was great the season it slef, but i am tottally turned off by ever ordering anything through the mail again.
B000ATQYT2|1.0|It's a DVD, that's good, but it omitted an entire scene for some unknown reason.  We watch this every year around Christmas time and very familiar with the movie.  The scene missing was the singing of \\"the love is gone\\" not sure about the title. For this I gave it one star.
B000KX0HVY|4.0|I looked all over for a CD set that would have darn near every hit of Elvis', and this seems to be it (better than the &#34;official&#34; &#34;Elvis #1 Hits&#34;, as that one for some reason doesn't have &#34;Viva Las Vegas&#34; (!?)).But, get the 3.0 edition of this (golden cover, eco-friendly cardboard packaging), because that has a third disc with &#34;Let Me Be Your Teddy Bear&#34;, among others.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|I love nature shows and I really appreciate learning about the planet, but I could really do without all the global warming junk that is constantly infiltrating more and more of these programs. There is no such thing as man-made global warming! The earth experiences natural cycles of warming and cooling all the time. The sun is by far the largest contributer to weather patterns and not how much I drive my car around town or if the industry down the street is operating or not. There are much more important concerns for humanity to be concerned with such as the over 50 million babies that have been murdered in the United States alone since Roe Vs. Wade. I think that's a bit more important than anything.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|As a huge fan of the Beatles, I was apprehensive about how the movie would treat these classic songs - until I saw the movie.  I immediately bought the DVD, and ordered the CD.  I gotta tell ya...I absolutely LOVE this soundtrack!  Great renditions of timeless songs - fun, passionate, and beautifully done.  Jim Sturgis (sp) and the rest of the cast have awesome singing voices.  If you love music, \\"Let It Be\\" will move you to tears...You have to experience it for yourself to understand, so buy it! : )
B000VJ271A|4.0|I have seen a number of Manons in my life; the most captivating one for a long time has been Bidu Sayao, but now there is a new champion - Natalie Dessay. She captures the vital essence of Manon in a performance full of nuanced charaterization and beautiful singing. The David McVickars production takes a little getting used to but that passes. Dessay and Villazon simply brush it off. The quintessential moment comes in the duet at the end of Act One: at the idea of living in Paris, the reaction of an estimable colleague-competitor of Dessay's is, \\"Oh, that would be nice.\\"Dessay's reaction is that of teenager (as Manon really is),  more like, \\"Oh-my-God, what I've always dreamed of, do you really mean it?\\" - all summed up in the way she gasps, \\"Paris!\\" Rest my case. Her whole performance is like that. Aside from the eccentric set, there is one other blot, the worn vocalism of Samuel Rainey's Comte de Grieux. Otherwise, go for it; this is the Manon we've been waiting for!
0978053583|4.0|The Master Key System by Charles Haanel is a fantastic book for anyone looking for inspiration to improve the quality of their life. A previous review states that this book is hard to read because of the size of the font used, but I encountered no difficulty. At this price, you get a real bargain for the amount and quality of information offered. This edition is a definite improvement compared to the other editions out there - it has been polished for grammatical correctness and contains four additional chapters that no other edition has. I'm very satisfied with this book.
0307386171|3.0|Mc Ewan is very good at descriptive writing. He successfully captures a very vivid scene. However, the storyline needs some work. It seems very empty and focuses so much on the history of the characters that it neglects to adequately build on the current situation enough. The book seems to be incomplete and ended before its time.
1582701709|5.0|A secret?  I'm not sure.  Fine psychological insights? I give it a thumbs up.  The Secret doesn't fit the feel good mode of many self-help books.  It falls more into the \\"take life seriously and make it happen\\" genre.  Rhonda Byrne assembles a wide assortment of teachers, gurus and others to help get across the message of The Secret.  In short, they say you have to position yourself as an energy force in the Universe and bring your actual world in line with the one of your visualization.<br /><br />I know that sounds like new age holistic mumbo jumbo.  However, the catalyst for this alignment, the Law of Attraction, as described in the book takes those things we have heard many times before and brings them into a manageable and compelling context.<br /><br />The Secret has an official companion DVD which also is well worth your time and helps to cement the message of the book for those visual learners as well as those who want a deeper understanding of the text.<br /><br />At first, I found the book a choppy read with all its quotes and snippets from historical and modern day teachers.  For this review, however, I gave The Secret a 5 stars rating because, if nothing else, the book offers many points for dialog and self-reflection.
0307388840|2.0|I tried for weeks to read this book and still haven't finished it. It is just so so slow! Not sure I could finish...when I inquired about the movie 'Atonement' reviews were quite similar...Definitely not my cup of tea!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I strongly reccomend this product!  At first when I looked at the dvd and it said that each routine was only thirty minutes long I was thinking that this was like the other short video workouts that I have. I was sooo wrong!  By the time you finish the exercises you are sweating a lot!  Already after using the dvd for one week along with watching my diet I have lost 2.5 pounds. Jillian is tough on the dvd but at the same time the challenge reinforces your will to keep excersing.  It is definetly worth the money!
B000ZN802W|3.0|This film is interesting enough to hold your attention throughout and although there are some magical moments there is an overwhelming amount of tragic ones. There are messages and life lessons but there is also much meaningless behind it as a young man opts out from the rat race to try and survive in the wild but usually returns to the streets or country as a homeless vagrant before trying once again to survive the roughest of places. Each time he goes out into the wild the ruthless conditions he chooses escalate. He hopes eventually to reach Alaska for the purest wild experience he can have.<br /><br />Ultimately the film is about the people that the boy meets on his journey and the advice they give him and the stories they have to tell. It is also about his parents and family back home that have lost him probably due to their own domestic issues and failure to communicate. It is more than a bit of a disturbing worldview.<br /><br />Into the Wild is worth watching and has an art-house indie feel but is quite a depressing one because its stars are mostly down and outs and lonely. Its message could well be get a job, have a family and enjoy your 9 to 5 as much as it is about trying to be original no matter what it takes. It's a strange one and in a few ways I wish maybe I could unwatch it. Maybe it helps us become more aware of the destitute problem and for that it can be commended, but at the same time you feel very uncomfortable watching the downward spiral of its main protagonist because it is a corkscrew into misery that he is choosing. The ending is shocking and horrific not because it is so graphic but because there is poetry in the distress.
B001MW0IY8|5.0|This is Antony's best album yet.  Though I enjoy his previous albums immensely, I have had to listen to them several times before I realized the sheer genius behind them.  This album, however, I fell in love with from the first listen (which was only a few hours ago as it was officially released the day of this writing).  Literally every song is a masterpiece of heartbreaking and fragile beauty.  The instrumentation alone is suberb and awe-inspiring.  Add to that Antony's ghostly, gentle, and emotionally-charged vibrato, and what you have is an incredible work of art that is in a league totally of its own, far surpassing the stagnant and dull world of most contemporary music.  The songs here transcend all categorization, including that of \\"happy\\" or \\"sad.\\"  They sound instead like dispatches from \\"another world,\\" a world where our petty concerns are lost in an overwhelming tide of beauty and purity. Rarely does a CD provoke such feelings in me.  Thank you Antony, thank you.

0312932081|4.0|I have been a big fan of Orson Scott Card since first reading Ender's Game many years ago.    I moved and lost my copy so when the opportunity came to purchase the hardcover version, I jumped at it.    The book and the subsequent ones that follow Ender Wiggins through his early years, his training at Battle School and subsequent winning of the Bugger Wars and beyond show Card's depth of understanding the human condition.    The visual ideas imparted by his use of vocabulary allow the reader to clearly 'see' the story which for me makes it even more entertaining.
0312383320|3.0|Which was, not much.  I have discovered with JE that low expectations prevent major disappointment.    I have given up on any character development.  Stephanie cannot possibly marry Joe and become just another housewife in the Burg.  Unfortunately, she's not honest enough to admit that, at the end of the day, she wants the same type of no-strings \\"relationship\\" that Ranger wants.  If it wasn't bad enough she's stringing two hot guys along, Diesel is her latest conquest.  And then there's Munch, who will do anything to have his way with her.  Enough already!  It doesn't work for LKH, and it won't work for JE, either.    As far as the supporting cast, everyone behaved exactly as they have for 14+ books.  It's rather sad when a monkey is the best supporting actor.  Wulf's supernatural powers were annoying and unnecessary - Plum is about the least threatening heroine ever written.    I did laugh out loud a couple of times, but basically at the absurdity of it all.  Borrow this from the library when you want a mindless escape.
0978053583|4.0|The Master Key System By Charles Haanel is a newly released version of a classic \\"Think Yourself to Success\\" title with additional material.    Each chapter is short (2-3 pages) and each ends with an exercise to practice every day for a week, as well as a \\"self-test\\" of questions related to material in the chapter.    The material itself is similar to what you would find in some flavors of New Age Spirituality, or books such as \\"The Secret\\". The exercises include things such as learning mental stillness, physical & mental relaxation, mental focus, creative visualisation, affirmations, forging an understanding or connection with imminence (which he calls the Universal Mind, and later God), creating one's own happiness, and so on. The book's thesis is that though training your mind in creative visualization and the law of attraction, you can be happier, healthier, richer, etc.    Some of the material, particularly in the later chapters could be considered somewhat preachy or cultish but overall, the lessons and instructions for training your self-awareness are a perfectly valid tool for self-improvement.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I love Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog. When it was only online I viewed it numerous times and of course bought it on DVD immediately. The music is so catchy and just so much fun to sing to.  Neil Patrick Harris is awesome as Dr. Horrible - the bad guy wanna be who has a soft spot for Penny (Felicia Day).  Penny has a sweet, sweet singing voice and she's torn between Billy (Dr. H) and Captain Hammer.  Capt. Hammer, played by Nathan Fillion, is a riot. I love this show because it has catchy music, it's funny, it's sweet, and has a little romance.  How can you not love a superhero, villain, sweet girl and it's all set to music??  It's a wonderful treat. Thank you writer's strike (this was filmed during last year's strike by TV writers).  Thank you Joss Whedon for bringing us such a sweet treat!

6305718954|5.0|I am satisfied with my purchase and was pleased with the time i had received it. i will buy from this person again.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This was so much fun. I have pre-ordered it. It was on OVATION the last two weeks and there is a clip on their site you can watch of episode 1. A must have for the Austen fanatic! She asks Darcy to get in the ornamental pool in his white linen shirt, it is a riot!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This movie is an instant classic.  Witty, funny and downright talented. While Nathan Fillion, Patricia Day and the other actors are not be belittled, Neil Patrick Harris really steals the show with his amazing vocal talents.  Yes you can watch this for free on hulu, but the DVD has superior audio, comedic commentary and of course Commentary! The Musical.  Well worth the pittance you pay for it.
1400064287|5.0|This is one of those books that you end up recommending to everyone. Communicators, teachers, pastors, managers... it's that important. Of course, it would be sad if a book on \\"making things stick\\" didn't stick with you, but that's also a self-proving thing: the book works by using its own principles.<br /><br />Most important about \\"Made to Stick\\" is the clear presentation of 6 principles that will change how you communicate. The next time you've got sweat pouring down the back of your neck as you stare at your executive team, this book can truly bring your pulse down. By using the techniques in the book -- simplicity, unexpectedness, credibility, concreteness, emotion, and story -- you'll knock it out of the park.<br /><br />The authors also do a wonderful job of providing tons of examples, and even discuss how to more effectively look for and spot schema-changing anecdotes and examples. Great all the way around, and truly communication-changing.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought the 30 Day Shred dvd after reading numerous positive reviews on here. It was definitely a good purchase for me! I began doing the Level 1 workout every other day because the next day I would be sore from it, but after about a week of it my body adjusted and I was able to do the workout every day.  Along with doing the 30 Day Shred dvd, I began eating healthy and within the first week I lost 3.5 pounds. I notice the most difference in my arms so far, which is no surprise considering the strength workouts will leave your arms burning!  My goal is to lose 15 pounds and between eating healthy and doing this dvd every day, I know my goal will be achieved before long!  I highly recommend this video for everyone. Whether you already exercise on a regular basis or are just beginning- this dvd will help you greatly!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I purchased this DVD as a gift for friends and they love it!!  If I decide to get one for myself, I'll be able to write a more complete review.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Citizen Kane is truly a masterpiece. The first time I watched it, I didnt really liked it. By the second time, it was awesome. I give the movie 5 stars and the DVD 5 stars.
1592402690|4.0|The first thing I will get out of the way is that if you are any kind of Beatles fan at all, you will find the book fascinating; fascinating but not necessarily enjoyable.      Geoff Emerick is a wonderfully talented engineer whose contribution to the work of The Beatles is significant. His place in the musical history of the 20th century is assured which makes parts of this book difficult to understand. Those are the parts where he seems to take a swipe at almost everyone he worked with at Abbey Road Studios. John, Ringo and especially George are the target of quite a few disdainful comments while Paul, (with whom Emerick continued to work after The Beatles), comes off much better. Amazingly, George Martin's contributions and presence are minimized to the point that at times he seems to be nothing more than an observer to The Beatles genius aided by Emerick's engineering ideas. Martin's influence may indeed have waxed and waned, but there is no doubt that his presence and his contributions helped to make the band the phenomena they were. There is no indication of that here.      This is not a gracious book. I am not convinced that everything I am reading here is the past remembered as much as it might be the past reconstructed for personal reasons. And that is the pity because the name Emerick looms large in the lexicon of Beatle lovers. There are marvelous parts of this book that give us a real insight into those heady days and nights when The Beatles were the center of the creative universe. Insights that engender new interest in old tracks. And yes, great audio accomplishments where Emerick's own talent made the difference. That is when this book comes alive.      Some judicious editing and direction would have made this into an important historical account of some of the most pivotal creative events in musical history. It is now a good book that is made less by the interspersed gratuitous insults that add nothing to our knowledge or to Emerick's reputation.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my brother who is an avid rocker. He was pleasantly surprised by this CD. It was mellow yet could get the blood pumping. I even enjoyed it and I typically don't like the same type of rock that he does.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This has instantly become one of my most favorite games to play. Its easy to teach, simple to play, and challenging to be good! Anyone I have showed this game, wants to play more. Games only take 20-30 minutes. Board is made of plastic, not much there, and the pieces are nice (although they can get scratched). Wonderful game, pick it up if you can!
B000002QWD|5.0|If you like traditional christmas music, then Bing Crosby is the way to go. I love listening to his music while doing anything around the house, but it sets a very relaxing tone to whatever I am doing.
1932100660|4.0|I have just read _The_China_Study_, and I heartily recommend it to anyone interested in his/her health (and who is not?).    I do have questions, though, that were not adequately explained in the book.  Dr. Campbell presents a lot of evidence showing the link between animal food consumption and various diseases of affluence, such as cancer.  The study of China that he reports examined rural and semi-rural populations, studying what the people ate and their resulting health.  Campbell's conclusion is that a vegan diet is the healthiest choice.    But.....   are these rural Chinese really vegan?    Campbell recommends a vitamin B12 supplement for vegans.  Vitamin B12 is essential for proper neurological functioning.   Now, do these rural Chinese take these supplements?   That seems impossible, so maybe they meet their B12 quota by eating vegetables grown in organic soil, without all of the dirt removed?  (Campbell suggests this is the natural way, see page 232.)    Before converting my family to veganism -- especially my child and myself, as I am planning to have more children soon -- I really feel that I need more information about what these healthy Chinese actually eat.  I'm guessing that they eat small amounts of animal protein as broths or condiments.  A small piece of liver will satisfy 1,400% of your daily requirement for B12.    I really like the book [[ASIN:1594201455 In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto], by Michael Pollan ]].  His point is that we should eat food from time-tested cuisines.  Is strict veganism such a cuisine?  Before more of the world is westernized, I hope someone writes a book about what these healthy, traditional people eat.    In the book [[ASIN:0920470386 Fats That Heal, Fats That Kill: The Complete Guide to Fats, Oils, Cholesterol and Human Health]], Udo Erasmus makes the strong point that misusing oils, and not having the correct balance of oils, creates these diseases of affluence.  Therefore, it is also important to understand how these healthy populations prepare their food.    If any of you know of a book that does this, or can provide a link in the right direction, I would be very appreciative if you shared it.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|I bought the 2 disc version with alll the extra's on disc two. I haven't watch disc two yet. The movie disc played fine. sound and picture quality was good.    I fell off the couch with laughter when Morgan Freeman asks Clint if he's gone to town for a woman after his wife died. Clint said he promised his wife he wouldn't pay for sex. Morgan Freeman then asks Clint, \\"Do you use your hand\\"?.............LOL.....Clint jsut glares at him.
031606792X|5.0|people want to read customer reviews to get a feel of whether or not they would like the novel. They do not read reviews to have the plot outlined for them and have any suspense and excitement crushed and destroyed!!! please keep this in mind and WARN people before you ruin the experience for them.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I watched this whole series from start to finish.  I didn't start it with that intention but this series grabs you from the get go and doesn't let go till the end.<br /><br />This is a look at Nature and Global consequences of life.  BBC makes great stuff and this ranks right up there.
B000VR824S|1.0|the dvd i ordered does not work. when you attempt to play it,it asks for a region..yes, a region ,but gives no choices or other info.  i sent a note to westentertainment or whatever their name is but that has been   several days and they have not responded either allowing the return or   explaining what i need to do to make this work. no one i know has ever  seen this problem...
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|Ed Norton & Brad Pitt are great together in this movie.<br /><br />A great surprise ending and a plot that seems terrorist for an American Militia...<br /><br />A must own for fans of either actor or \\"Down with the system!\\" movies.
B000QEIORG|5.0|Yep, you heard me right.  Hard to believe Dave Grohl emerged out of Nirvana and the grundge movement, and essentially pushed the rock and roll envelope.  I am not sure I have heard melody and the frentic energy of punk meshed so masterfully.  Not a weak cut on this one and the diversity and lyrical insights are an in the face punch.  Try to find an album that finishes with a beautiful ballad like Walking After You and ends by the band/Grohl screaming triumphantly in New Way Home \\"im not scared, im on my way home\\".  Damn, if that song alone dosen't motivate the hell out of you something is wrong in your DNA make up.  This is an album that belongs in any serious collection of rock and roll, and gave this rock and roll fan hope for the next decade and more.
0307269752|5.0|I bought this book in French and after 40 pages or so, found it boring and set it aside. Lo and behold, someone gave me the English version: I was riveted. The mix of hippie life, corporate intrigues, editorial rooms, etc is breathtaking.<br />As soon as I was finished, I went to get the second volume (in French) which is even better. IMPOSSIBLE to set down. You wake up during the night and want to know more so you turn on the light and so on.<br />A must
B00005JM02|5.0|What I like to do with this DVD is (besides watching the movie) is to go into the menu and put an aqurium on my big screen TV and it's great for when you're by yourself or have friends over.  There are two really good ones that I like, and I can change \\"the aqurium\\" any time I like.  What a great idea.
B0018M6J90|5.0|This is not a movie for those who like raw action or feel the need for things to blow up in order to be entertained (though those movies can be fun, too.) This is a dialogue and a character movie. McDormand plays Miss Pettigrew, a nanny who has failed at retaining any of her previous positions for any length of time, and she is seriously down on her luck. An act of desperation forces her to take on a new identity, one she feels she is an impostor at. Adams plays a spoiled, naive actress bent on fame. When their worlds come together the audience sees a relationship develop and a transformation in both women until they become who they truly were inside. McDormand is perfectly understated in her role and Adams delightfully over the top. Though the movie is a spoof on the British parlor comedy, it is also serious in parts.
B000002HJD|5.0|All went very well with this transaction. The case cracked in shipping which was a small disapointment but item arrived on time and went straight under the christmas tree. Overall I am very happy with my purchase.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|.......and probably the best I've ever seen.  I bought this movie on a whim having never heard anything about it.  What a treat this turned out to be.  It is wonderfully written, acted, and directed.  Several subplots are ingeniously woven into a very, very funny movie.  Ignore the 1 star reviewers - one can only assume they don't \\"get\\" British humor.  Everyone I've played this for has had the same reaction to it, and judging from the vast majority of the reviews here, most people find it as hilarious as my friends and I have.
B001AQMBJQ|5.0|Why wait for an undetermined date of release for season five when you can stream season six straight from the islands broadcast centre? You wouldn't believe me if i told you the Harlem Globetrotters put them up to one of their biggest challenges yet. It's all so exciting to watch it all unfold.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|I almost didn't take a look at this movie because I couldn't figure what Tim Burton and Johnny Depp would be doing with a musical.  I'm glad I decided to check it out just for the hell of it.   I've never seen any other rendition of Sweeny Todd so I had nothing to compare it to.  So I have no idea if it followed the original or not, but I know it was very well done and very entertaining.    One of the things that just kept amazing me was just how extremely evil Depp could come across even while singing away.  He truely has the skill to switch between a very charming and gentile barber one minute and into a heartless murderer the next with such ease that it's hard to believe it's just acting.    Although the entire film was was set with a very believable backdrop for its time period there was just one little Burton special that was so outragous that it made me laugh.  Sometimes the blood gushing out was in such a large quantity that it was literally an over kill....But that's probably what Burton was going for so it didn't just go so dark that it became grim.    The rest of the cast was fantastic too, but Depp did a musical so damn well that I was compelled to give this review....
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Cheap alternative to the BR version if you want to watch this show HD. Off course, you will need a HD DVD player.
B000UJ48SQ|3.0|Does it make any sense to make such a beautiful movie, just to state a trivial truth that there are 1000s ways for a man to screw his own life?
061891868X|5.0|Lee Smolin is a man of many talents.  This book demonstrates not only his wonderful ability as a physicist, but also his excellent writing skills and ability to describe highly technical mathematical domains in a manner that those of us who are mathematically challenged can never-the-less get a chance to enjoy the view.    I am a person who is incredibly curious about \\"Life, the Universe and Everything\\", but not having the mathematical background to grasp cutting edge physics in its raw state, Lee was able to decipher the hieroglyphics in a manner that I could completely understand.  That is a special talent he has, for which I am most thankful.    This book was riveting throughout, and gave me some of the deepest insights that I have had the pleasure of experiencing in my desire to understand more about this subject.    I highly recommend this book to anyone who has a general interest in the subject as being one of the best books that you can read, understand and enjoy.
B0010AN7Y0|5.0|Great film, full of touching humour. I bought this USA version because I'd previously purchased the UK product and the quality was very poor. US version is indeed much sharper and does the movie justice.
B001LRJH0U|2.0|It contains good character development. However it has little action and it drags on and on. Watching this is like reading a textbook. You know it's meaningful but it's not fun at all.
B001AEF6CW|5.0|I got this for my boyfriend for christmas and he loved it.  It was shipped really fast and arrived before christmas, since i ordered it so close.
B000NJXC4E|5.0|Im glad kimbroughs music is finally being heard, imagine playing this your whole life and only now being properly recognized for it (its too bad he passed away). Wish he would still alive and jammed out with these fellas. Black keys does a wonderful job in not over interpreting this raw style of blues and is very minimalistic with the added background effects which only enhance this type of blues. Very strong tracks from beginning to end, only wish the record was longer. This isnt the white stripes, but I would say they fall in the same \\"Born-Again Blues\\" (&lt;-Just came up with that term) type of category.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|From the Earth to the Moon!  What an incredible DVD set!!  This is one set I will never loan to anyone!!  Packed with so much information that I never knew existed!! I highly recommend this to anyone who loves America, is a space enthusiast or a history buff!!  Can't say enough about this DVD set.  So many fine actors it's unbelievable!! I've watched it 3 times since I've received it and will watch many more times.  Fills one with such a sense of awe, wonder and pride.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|My husband and I watched the series on HBO - it was very well done. Because we watched it several times, I purchased it for my husband's birthday in January.  He was elated that he now has his own copy of the series.
159448385X|5.0|I could not put the book down after I started reading it.  It's hard to believe that so much suffering and injustices are still taking place in our time. Before when I heard \\"Afghanistan\\" on the news,  I couldn't care less. Now, I think of innocent victims, good-hearted  people affected by the thirst for power and the fanaticism of man.
B0000524CY|4.0|I believe that this is one of the scariest horror movies of all time.    Taking William Peter Blatty's rich and excellent screenplay, director William Friedkin takes it to the next level and delivers a powerfully tight and scary film.    This was helped, of course, by the wonderful performances given by Ellen Burstyn, Max von Sydow, Linda Blair, Lee J. Cobb, Jason Miller and the rest of the cast.
B001L7TDQ8|5.0|A Happy New Year!  It is a greeting and a wish exchanged in all languages in all countries throughout the world, but nowhere is it better expressed in music than at the annual New Year's Day concert in Vienna.  The joy, the fun, the exquisite beauty and the high spirits - all these are found in the music offered here, principally provided by members of Vienna's Strauss Family.<br /><br />Nineteen items are included in the 2009 program: 14 by Johann Strauss Jnr, 1 waltz by Josef Strauss, 2 items by Johann Strauss Snr, 1 by Josef Hellmesberger Jnr, and - as a special \\"novelty\\" item - the final movement of Haydn's \\"Farewell\\" Symphony.<br /><br />Daniel Barenboim presides for the first time at these events.  Perhaps the Viennese \\"lilt\\" is not as evident as some could wish, but Barenboim certainly allows the side drum to add verve to the proceedings whenever required.<br /><br />Coinciding with this joyous celebration was an eruption of slaughter and destruction in Gaza, and you'll hear Barenboim adding to his new year greeting the wish that the new year will see a return to peace in that area.
B000P0J09C|4.0|The opening scene in Full Metal jacket has been hailed by many as being priceless.  I agree.    Based on the novel by Gustav Hasford,  director Stanley Kubrick creates a fascinating movie from the equally fascinating screenplay by Michael Herr and Gustav Hasford.  The writers and the director accomplished a very difficult task with a difficult subject matter.    The cast treats us to memorable performances.  Notably, Matthew Modine, who is perfect and extracts sympathy as a private in the military.  Vincent D'Onofrio with his complex portrayal as Pvt. Pyle.  And of course, R. Lee Ermey in his unforgettable portrayal as the sergeant.    Loved the music also.
B001239A7I|5.0|I'd consider this one of the best five albums ever recorded.  Period.  Every song is a masterwork.  There is a great cohesiveness throughout.  Anyone who loves a great song should check this out.  A must own cd!
B0000942FU|5.0|Norah is Fine;!!!!!<br />  I found her from others recommendations, she is so mellow. She maybe young and her style is initially misleading, She is a young woman in a older Blues woman's body, her future is guaranteed as long as he voice stays so unique and her own material she writes stays so fine<br /> One mix up, Norah has 2 Albums that are the same, only one gives you a DVD, That is this one, unless you enjoy DVD's (I don't)save a few $$ and buy her regular CD \\"Norah Jones\\" and use the money saved to buy some of her other personal work....<br />So the answer to the question are their new and young upcoming Female Blues Artists who write their own music as good as our past Divas, lol<br />You Betcha, here is one!!!
0316017922|5.0|Easy to read explanations of how culture, ability, desire and chance all play interrelated parts in lives of extraordinary achievement.  Gets you to look at the world from a different angle.  You can get thought the book in a day or two, but will be thinking about it for a long time.

B00003CXA2|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies that I have ever seen; Tom Hanks has got to be one of the best actors of our time. The story and the time line in this movie are what I remember in my life thus far. I can watch this movie over and over again and always see something that I hadn't seen before. I really enjoy this movie and I can always enjoy it anytime that I want to now.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I received the movie quickly, in great condition.     Jesus Christ is the Messiah. He died to save you, a sinner, from going to hell. God is love. Love Him back. Romans 6:23, 10:9-10
B001NFNFIK|3.0|I am a huge fan of James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheaux books.  I have read most of them and most of them have been top notch.  Unlike most series, Burke's actually gets better and better and just when you think its peaked, he writes something better.    Having read so many of the books, I always pictured either Harrison Ford, Alec Baldwin (in his younger, lighter days) and Tommy Lee Jones as Dave.  2/3 predictions have come true.  Tommy Lee Jones is the perfect David Robicheaux, this character was meant for him to play.    In the Electric Mist is one of the best books in the series, so how come with a great book and great casting the movie is only ok?    The problem is the movie itself is very very inside.  The screen writers did too good a job adapting the story from the book.  Remember the book is a middle book of a very long running series.  As a fan and reader of the series, I knew who everyone was and how they got there.  The problem for the mass audience will be that they will have no idea who half the people are and the film does not really give any answers.    This unfortunately will be a film liked by those who have read the books, and not fully understood by those who have not.    Twice filmakers have well casted and made well intentioned adaptations of the books, and twice they have not come through as they should have.
0061122416|1.0|I do not get how anyone likes this book at all. It's boring. It's repetitive. It's horridly simple. The characters have no depth. Every character speaks like the next. The dialog is ridiculous. It's full of cliches and platitudes that have a tenuous connection if any at all.    I am baffled, BAFFLED that anyone likes this book. There is nothing here. I can possibly see a 13 year old simpy girl finding this deep. Just like a 13 year old simpy girl would find Backstreet Boy's lyrics deep. But how any grown person who has actually lived in any form of reality can find this book to be anything other than drivel blows my mind.     I read this for a book club and I am going to smack who ever suggested it.
1400082773|5.0|If you want to know our new President and what to expect from him, this book is a \\"must-read.\\" It's about his quest to understand himself as a half-black, half-white man in America. Written when he was a state Senator in Illinois, his words have the energy and candor of youth as he describes his childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia, the scorching experience of a young idealist trying to help the poor in South Chicago, and the enlightenment that came with going to Kenya where his father lived and died. You see his values taking shape, and you share in the experience. He is a gifted writer with a gripping story to tell.    During the campaign for the presidency, I read blogs and columns that asked \\"Who is this Obama? What kind of man is he? Who is behind the calm public image?\\" This book tells the answer; it puts the reader in Barack's shoes. For me as a 71-year-old white man, the book was an education that I couldn't have got anywhere else. Only a person half-black and half white could lead a person like me to experience what it's like to be black in a mostly-white land. I will be forever grateful to him for the education.

B00000ICN5|3.0|Recommended highly by a friend, but unless you like country I don't recommend that you spend your money on this.
0156030209|3.0|When you write a novel involving fantastical situations and characters who never question the wisdom of God, the reader goes rooting around for allegories... and in this novel, never really finds them.  There's lots of nearly unendurable violence, particularly in the retelling of the fictional tale in a truthful context at the end; there's gratuitous shock stuff, like Pi catching the Tiger's feces in a cup.  And then there's the floating island.  I could go on, but I'll just say this:  Keats addressed the Truth/Beauty thing, Melville addressed the God/No God thing, and I didn't find any modern interpretations of either issue.  Nothing but two stories, one \\"fact\\", one \\"fiction\\", and the only character I truly cared about was Richard Parker (the Tiger) and he turned out to be (probably) just the pretty story told by a boy who is basically an incredibly inventive liar.  The God represented in the story is basically embraced as a loveable lie.  Overly cute and clever, entertaining, but if you are looking for something new and illuminating, this ain't it.  There's also a plagarism problem, and perhaps that's part of my hostility.  There's also a boastful message from the author thanking the tax payers for supporting artists like himself so that we all can \\"dream\\" and perhaps both taken together soured me on this novel.
B00003CXDV|5.0|As a Star Trek fan since forever, this movie made me laugh till I cried. Acting excellent! Story excellent! Can't recommend it highly enough! Those who are not clued into the Star Trek formulas may still get some laughs but not as many as Star Trek fans.

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|If you enjoyed ABBA, you should enjoy this movie.  While the actors are not professional singers, they are professional actors and their efforts are heart felt and ring true.  Can't say enough about Meryl.  She showed another deminsion and rose to a new level of acting.
0930289234|5.0|I've been told about Watchmen for years by various comic book fans in my life and I finally decided to take the plunge before the movie came out and ruined any chance I had of approaching this story fresh in its original form.<br />I'm glad I did but I really didn't need to be worried.  There is simply no way the movie is going to be able to capture all the nuance of this work.<br />Far more than just a comic book, this story incorporates fictional texts from inside the story's universe that draw you into its world in a way that I'm not sure any other medium could.  The story itself unfolds beautifully panel by panel as the notion of the superhero becomes twisted about and we follow along in the investigation of the murder of a masked crime-fighter named The Comedian (one of the few superheroes left still allowed to operate by the government).  As things progress and unravel we begin to sink into the lives of various superheroes with all their tics and problems and phobias and disorders slowly coming out into the open, learning along the way that they're not always super and they're not always heroes.<br />And then the medium itself begins to twist and take on other forms.  You'll read about a psyche evaluation that one of the heroes undergoes before finding an excerpt from that psyche evaluation \\"taped\\" to the end of one of the chapters.  Or you'll come across sections of an expose tell-all book that one of the heroes wrote neatly slipped in between the panels of the comic book form.  Police reports and transcripts and bits and pieces of this universe get piled onto the artwork and panels until it feels like you're lingering over a scrapbook from a real world instead of watching a fictional adventure unfold.<br />As a fan of bent heroes and dark drama I was very taken with this work and while the ending felt like it slipped out of my grasp a bit I still think this is one of the most original works of art I have ever encountered.
B001CD6FKS|4.0|There are a lot of inconsequential reviews here, so I felt the need to write up a review for Blu-ray fans.    Let's talk tech. The transfer of Speed Racer is one of the most pristine I've ever seen. Scratch that, it is the most pristine I've ever seen, ranking with the Pixar visual kingpins on Blu-ray and probably surpassing even them. Remember that this film is basically a high-tech live action cartoon on LSD, so if you want a demo disc for your 1080p television and your Blu-ray player or PS3, this is your ticket and demands a purchase. The insanely garish color scheme and flamboyant special-effects added to every filmmaking trick in the book pretty much sum up a psychedelic experience unparalleled in present day mainstream filmmaking. I give 5 stars, make that 10 stars, for the visuals of this disc but a film is judged not merely on visuals alone.     While the look of this movie is out of this world, the story, characters and dumbed down cartoon sensibility of it all will have to knock this flick down a few notches. This is the same dumb story you expect when you go into a Hollywood blockbuster production but the Wachowski brothers succeed in making it a unique visual experience that is quite a trip, especially in high-definition!    The audio experience is not nearly as overwhelming. We get a standard issue Dolby Digital 5.1 track but I was too enthralled with what my eyes were seeing to really care. The sound is just fine. The extra features are not extensive but have enough depth to them. There is even some racing game included somewhere on one of the extra discs. I couldn't care less about this junk as I'm in it for the movie itself but I don't love it enough to explore the extra stuff they've thrown on the discs.    The film is delirious, a comedy in some ways, a demented action movie in just about all other ways. There are a few narrative disruptions in the film and you can see the Wachowski brothers wanted to throw in some nonlinear storytelling techniques. Take one scene in particular. Speed is at the offices of the evil, egomaniacal racing league CEO played by Roger Allam. ( For the life of me, this guy looks a lot like Christopher Hitchens of all people! Anyone else notice this? ). The evil CEO starts telling Speed about all the terrible things that will happen to Speed if he refuses to comply and join the corporate racing league or whatever. While the evil guy is telling this story, we actually jump right into the events as they are happening, but after the climax we are back in the office of the evil CEO and Speed talking. We are led to believe that this action scene was all just imagination of a possible future but the next scene has Speed at home, living down the consequences of being cheated out of victory, having failed exactly as the CEO predicted, meaning that the events actually happened but we've been jumping through the timelines to make unattentive audiences dizzy.     This and a couple of other nifty scenes make the point that the Wachowskis are still very apt filmmakers. I do wish they would apply their talents to more sophisticated material however.    During the climax of the film, everything comes together and the finale has an ecstatic, super-exuberant quality to it, a real triumphant coda that was sorely lacking in the dismal \\"The Matrix: Revolutions\\", the last film the bros. directed. Speed Racer has some competent actors working together. Emile Hirsch is a talented guy, Roger Allam is sleazy as sleazy can be, John Goodman and Susan Sarandon lend support as the parents, Christina Ricci is a tad annoying as the gal pal and Matthew Fox as the long, lost brother is just as cheesy as required. I was a bit disappointed that the brothers didn't reunite at the end of the film but I think the filmmakers were going for a future story angle in a potential sequel. A sequel that most likely will never be made as Speed Racer tanked at the box office.    Speed Racer gets 3 out of 5 stars as a film. Good, clean, psychedelic fun for all ages! Whoopie! But the Blu-ray sports an extraordinary visual palette that must be seen to be believed and that I give 5 stars, so overall an average of 4 stars it is. Please don't judge my merits as a film buff based on my high ranking for this film but my heart was stolen by this Blu-ray. I must go and atone for my sins of enjoying mainstream blockbusters by watching films by my beloved Antonioni and Bresson! Oh 1080p, whatever have you done to me?! ( Film buffs are now laughing at my ridiculous jokes! )
B001GQACGO|3.0|Let me start by saying I am not a fan of Beyonce's vocals.  However, I was really impressed by If I Were A Boy and then Halo.  I decided to buy this album.  I don't like the 'Sasha' side at all, but I love what she did with the ballads.  So much control with her vocals,  I don't know where this came from, but I hope she never goes back.  Halo is my favorite song, however, all the songs on the first disc are really well done.  I'm giving it a 3 because Beyonce did not have the courage to release the first disc on it's own.  That second disc is just dumb.
0425179877|4.0|Several have brought attention to Gene Kranz' ability (or lack thereof) to write with any major talent--and while that truly is apparent, those who can read between those lines, and be honest, it isn't hard to do, will find an incredibly detailed account--an insiders one at that--of life right in the thick of America's Space Race.<br /><br />Gene has an ability, through his meticulous note-taking, to bring amazing details about some of the most dramatic moments in ALL of History (IMO). He was front and center with just about the best seat in the house (other than onboard the cramped spaceships themselves) and in many instances, was critical in helping NASA keep and maintain their amazing safety record--despite some VERY well documented mishaps. Having read Apollo 13 (originally titled 'Lost Moon') I discovered that the movie only explored maybe HALF of the actual life-threatening problems they really faced--ALL of which held the potential to kill all three astronauts, and from Gene's perspective from inside Mission Control in Houston, we see in greater detail how heaven and earth was moved to bring those men home safe...and that is just one PART of a much larger story involving Mission Control at NASA. The heart-breaking disaster of Apollo 1 when they lost 3 irreplaceable astronauts while never having even left the launch pad wasn't just a loss for the friends and families of those who died, but a tremendous blow to virtually everyone within NASA--and not simply because the resulting fire placed the Russians squarely on track to beat us to the moon. This was a deeply personal tragedy to Gene Kranz, one in which he carefully, and in detail, helps us to understand better.<br /><br />All fans of NASA, Mercury, Gemini and Apollo space flight owe themselves the opportunity to get a very rare glimpse into a world that, outside of the movies, we almost never get to see--especially with such candor. Gene won't receive any literary awards necessarily for his writing talent, but he more than makes up for it with tremendous honesty and insight into what gave the Greatest Generation the Right Stuff to begin with.makes up for it with tremendous honesty and insight into what gave the Greatest Generation the Right Stuff to begin with.

B000065VA1|2.0|Believe it or not, this guy has actually written some fairly decent songs, but you won't find any of them here. His solo career prior to this was idiosyncratic and frankly, just plain weird. It wasn't terribly good to begin with and it relied too heavily on the sounds of the era to warrant being regarded as particularly unique, but still songs like \\"Solsbury Hill\\" and \\"Biko\\" were genuinely good. But then the spell is broken.    I suppose you don't rub shoulders (or in this case knees against shoulders) with the mighty guru of flop-pop, Phil Collins, without learning a few techniques on how to pitch a product that no one sane could conceivably want by making it so sanitized, so lowest common denominator, so glossily over produced,  and so commercialized to the point that even the cynics had to get up and boogie.     Prior to this record, PG wasn't selling on the level that I guess he felt he should have been. He must have undoubtedly witnessed the rise to pop prominence of Phil Collins and the three stooges collectively known as Genesis while simultaneously turning more than a little green with envy. It's usually the moneky that does the imitating, but this tour de force of musical quackery finds PG flinging feces as efficaciously as Phillip the chimp ever did.    Well, let's start where it hurts the most. No points for guessing it was \\"Sledgehammer\\", a song truly deserving the dubious distinction of being perhaps the worst song ever written, produced, and performed shamelessly and seemingly ad infinitum  in a show of public humiliation that would give a masochist something to aspire to. PG finds himself wandering dazed and confused down the precarious corridors of Tom Jones territory on this embarrassment. Bad sexual euphemisms from a middle aged man apparently intent on conferring sex symbol status on himself in spite of the nagging suspicion one gets that he probably spends more time apologizing to women after making love to them than anything else.    \\"Don't GiveUp\\", here our hero employs an old Collinsian trick of trade as he explains what a loser he is while proceeding to weep unashamedly into a woman's skirt (a guest starring Kate Bush). This latter element is unfamiliar in Collins' bag of tricks and I think that's because most of us assume he probably couldn't get a woman anyway. I believe PG composed this trite, pseudo-inspirational ditty with the expectation that people would find it uplifting and encouraging. In a manner of speaking it is, I guess, insofar as one can be eternally grateful that they aren't Peter Gabriel.    \\"Red Rain\\", not a terrible song in and of itself. It suffers from really bad production and a really bad 80's sound. The lryics try hard to save it, but fail dismally. Later live versions would however find this track redeemed to some extent.    \\"Big Time\\", sort a declaration of intent. I suspect PG knew what he was doing from the start with this stinking refuse of an album.\\"Big Time\\" is our hero apparently daydreaming and frothing at the mouth as he envisages just how much his transformastion to the tried and true Collinsian formula of flop-pop is going to enhance his commercial profile and thusly his pockets. A very serious contender for worst song of the decade, along side its hideous sibling, \\"Sledgehammer\\".    \\"In Your Eyes\\", there are certainly far worse moments on the album than this track but that of course is hardly a ringing endorsement. PG scrapes the bottom of the barrel once again for Collinsian tricks and comes up with a can't miss approach, a love song so vapid and emotionally cliched and empty that it would make Mick Hucknell blush. The only silver lining here is that the song is wisely kept under control at about 5 and a half minutes while live performances have seen this carnage carried out for 11 plus minutes to the chagrin of all but the deaf or comatose. This is also an example of PG's growing interest in African percussion, highlighting that he abuses musical stylings the world over with equal opportunity.    The rest of the album is just filler and I'd be surprised if PG himself would even recognize the titles of his own dubious ventures into the domain of the swill, so bravely pioneered by one, Mr. Phil Collins.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|\\"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things... and no good thing ever dies.\\"  Sixteen words.  Eighteen syllables.  Endless emotions.<br /><br />The work began as short story fiction which first appeared in a collection of four novellas by author Steven King.  [[ASIN:0451167538 Different Seasons (Signet)]] - which contains the original RITA HAYWORTH AND THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and gave rise to three film adaptations from the pages within, (the stellar [[ASIN:0800141628 Stand by Me]], the limp [[ASIN:0767821599 Apt Pupil]] and this film) - marked the starting line for this race, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION - starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in each actor's finest roles - marks the finish line.  But the race against time and tide that occurs across both formats has absolutely nothing to do with what the casual observer might suspect.  Contrary to what you might think, this tale has much less to do with a wrongly imprisoned man who manages a stunning and bold escape than it does with one simple ideal: Hope.  The story compels both the reader and the filmgoer to never give up on hope.<br /><br />Bettering the original text by miles, Frank Darabont's 1994 masterpiece captures and conveys the struggle, despair and - ultimately - the hope that exist at odds with each other in the life of wrongly convicted and (at first appearance) defeated Andy Dufresne.  The cuckolded Dufresne (pronounced Doo Frane - I mention this simply because when I first read the novella in high school, I could not for the life of me figure out how the pronounce the guy's name! - and played with a weariness and determination second to none by Robbins in all of his post [[ASIN:B00005V9HG Bull Durham]] glory) is arrested, charged, tried, convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the cold blooded, heat-of-the-moment murder of his Wife and her illicit secret lover.  All of this occurs within the first few minutes of the film, and following Dufresne's arrival at the upstate Maine, maximum security prison, we are off to the races.  What follows is a series of tests for the battle worn Dufresne; each subsequent hardship more brutal and vicious than the previous.  Yet all the while Dufresne holds onto the notion that hope will endure.  You see, Andy is an innocent man.  Don't believe him?  Neither does anyone else within the prison.  Not even his newest \\"friend\\", Ellis Boyd \\"Red\\" Redding (Freeman).  But Andy holds on.  And in time... prevails.<br /><br />Borrowing heavily from King's actual text, Darabont - who also penned the screenplay - moves the story into a tighter space.  Excising some of the characters (the numerous Prison Wardens of the novella have been spliced into one raging beast of a man, expertly played by Bob Gunton) and streamlining the narrative provide Darabont the means to bury the idea of fading but eternal hope straight into the heart of the viewer.  The basic premise is still present... in fact much of King's actual dialogue is used throughout the film.  But Darabont makes just enough changes to push the story in a more open and raw direction.  (The character of Red, for example, is a hard living, red haired Irishmen in the original story; Darabont cast Freeman and turned the friendship between the two main characters on its head.)<br /><br />I could go into greater explanation about how this film has affected me in a very deep and graphic way.  I could explain how the scene in which Andy, drenched in the new rain of freedom, arms outstretched to the heavens and standing alone as a free man for the very first time, sends chills down my spine every time I even envision it in my mind.  I could explain how the scene in which Red feels the need to beg for a bathroom break from his new \\"Boss\\" at the grocery store causes me to feel so sad for the lost soul that Red has become.  I could explain how the sad post script messages left by not only Brooks but by Red himself dug into the boarding house rafters bring on an insurmountable grief the likes of which I cannot define.  I could explain how the final pilgrimage undertaken by Red as he skips town and streaks southward on a Greyhound bus, reciting King's exact words along the way - \\"I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.  I hope to see my friend... I hope to shake his hand... I hope.\\" - bring a flood of tears and goose bumps forward in my psyche.  I could explain how witnessing Andy and Red's final reunion on a sandy Mexico beach reminds me of the hope I hold onto that I too will have a similar reunion with my long deceased Mother in heaven.  I could but I won't.  And I won't detail more elements of the film as many here have already done so.  Besides, has anyone reading this not seen this film?  I doubt it.  What I would like to do, however, is to have the reader consider a different take on why this film is so moving and so important in the lexicon of Hollywood.<br /><br />This film is by far one of the greatest films to come out of the 1990's... a time when America was at war in Iraq - the first time around - and the stability of our hopes and dreams were in doubt.  Sure that conflict ended quickly.  But at the time, for many members of Generation X, (myself included) an all out Holy war seemed imminent.  Having survived the Cold War and the notion of immediate nuclear annihilation, (anyone remember the made for television movie [[ASIN:B0001WTVUW The Day After]]?) we were once again thrown back on our heels at the thought of further destruction.  Our hope was fading.  Perhaps Darabont sensed this when he optioned the rights to King's novella, originally published in 1982.  Or perhaps there were other more divine sources at work.  Who knows.  Maybe it just took that long to get the script up on its feet.  But whether it was Darabont, the Gods or just the ever present weight of time... this film came along right when we needed it to.  King's tale of hope is felt so deeply throughout the film.  This eternal idea that hope never dies.  Trapped by time and circumstances beyond his control, Andy chips away at a future free from the confines of cinder and steel.  So too did the rest of us. We just didn't know it at the time.  Andy's struggle mirrored our own.  The film provided a glimpse toward hope.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2001.  Steel came crashing down and fires surged under the ground in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania.  Can you imagine a better time for the renewal of hope than September of 2001.  And again, along came THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.  In 2004, the Tenth Anniversary Edition DVD dropped into our laps as a subtle reminder that hope springs eternal.  Sure, it came three years after 9/11.  But it also came along at a time when our hearts were beginning to heal and our minds were beginning to open.  And there it was once again, reminding us that good things never die.<br /><br />It is for this reason that I believe that THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is one of the greatest films of all time.  Showing us the path in 1994, and providing us a gentle reminder in 2004.  I am curious to see what 2014 will bring.  Curious and cautious at the same time.  But I know one thing that will be there regardless: Hope.  Because, as Andy himself writes in his last letter to his dear friend Red: \\"\\"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things... and no good thing ever dies.  I hope this letter finds you... and finds you well.\\"<br /><br />It is a credo that I live by and live for.  Hope.

0345444051|4.0|This was my first Arthur C. Clarke book and it definitely will not be the last. It is a chillingly humbling story about the \\"invasion\\" of Earth by some alien guardians with a secret mission. The story is very creative and brings us through the limitless galaxy of Clarke's imagination and curiosity. Some of Clarke's vision came true, such as our ability to determine paternity and much more efficient air travel. The book serves as a reminder about the \\"smallness\\" of Man and the possibility that exists beyond the minuscule world we are aware of.    As alluded by the title of the book and this review, the book is melancholic and quite depressing. I certainly hope that Clarke's other books aren't as negative. I think that when and if intelligent alien life were to come to Earth, it would indeed be the end of mankind's childhood phase.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I was dubious about this movie for the first few minutes, but the more I watched, the more intrigued I became.  The story is a loosely plotted love story involving two young lovers and their friends caught up in the changing and sometimes violent times of the era as a backdrop for Beatles songs (I must admit I curious to see how they did Maxwell's Silver Hammer, but that song was never used.)  The characters all had incredible voices, ranging from sweet to raunchy (Dana Fuchs' vocals are a dead ringer for Janis Joplin), and the minimalist musical background really brought those voices and the lyrics to the forefront.<br /><br />I ended up watching it several times over, and still wouldn't mind seeing it again.
0545128285|2.0|The phrase \\"Where's the Beef\\" comes to mind.  This wouldn't be long enough for a chapter in the Harry Potter books, not at all what I expected.  I didn't think J. K. Rowling would do this to her readers.  The stories, especially The Warlocks Hairy Heart were very good.  109 pages with very wide margins, large type and double lined easily held all 5 stories.  Could probably have done it on 30 without much trouble.  You're really making a donation to Children's High Level Group.
B000MZHW40|5.0|I can't this about this movie without taking a deep breath!  The violence is incredible (even for the jaded audiences of today), but the more subtle forms of violence (kidnapping and indoctrination of young children) is equally horrific.  I actually had to take a break in the middle because I was overwhelmed by the mass slaughter I was seeing.<br /><br />It describes in detail the misery being inflicted on the people of South Africa by the world lust for diamonds, and I find it difficult to believe that your world view won't be changed by watching.<br /><br />I have a friend with a brother in the jewelry business, and she said  once this movie came out, it changed the jewelry business dramatically.  Let's hope the change is permanent, and that the changes will make a difference.

I'm also a big fan of the NASB and NET translations) and the quality of the publishing is B+. It's not the _best_ binding, but it's a lot better than most books now. The paper is great and the printing is amazing. It's not quite the publishing quality of a Cambridge Bible (which I also own in the ESV and NASB translations), but it's $59 vs. $140.

B000002KBU|5.0|This is one of Joni Mitchell's finest works, with every song a classic.  Those not familiar with Joni might do well to start by listening to Blue.  I've had this tape for years - listening constantly in the car for months at a time.  I recently thought it would be wonderful to get all of Joni's older music on CD and I am so happy I did.  She is probably the most talented singer, songwriter, musician that my generation worshipped. However, Joni's music is timeless and intrinsically tied to our deepest emotions - evoking memories of unrequited, lost and newly cherished love.  Her songs promote a deep look at the past and her optimism is so relevant today in the climate of our newfound political hope.
