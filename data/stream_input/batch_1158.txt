B002WYH5N2|5.0|This movie is a wonderful remake due tothe great chemistry among the main characters! A classic romance you have to see again. Ordering on Amazon was a good experience because I got the items quickly and without any problems.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Download took forever (even over 40mbps wi-fi) and this was my first app from the Amazon market so I had to jump through all the hoops first. Finally got it installed, then it just wouldn't play. I would get to the hourglass and then a blank screen. I moved it to the SD card to free up space and was able to get to the title screen, but then it froze there and wouldn't even get back to that far. I tried clearing data, freeing up memory by closing all but the most important applications. Nothing worked. The game was 75MB which is way too big for a game like this. To put it in perspective, Angry Birds is only 3MB. Obviously some more development is needed to make a port that will work properly under the fragmentation.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I absolutely love this game! Runs great on my Droid X with no issues. Grabbed as free app of the day but it is worth buying....
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great game. The rest of this is to fill up twenty words. Oh, and whiners that don't read the description are dumb.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|75mb before and now after Moving to SD Card 700kb, don't be afraid of the size. I been waiting all month for this and now its free
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Think tower defense, but simpler.  graphics and story are great.  The personality of the game is what truly makes it unique.
159420229X|5.0|I bought this book after hearing a radio interview which was very engaging. I wasn't disappointed when I got to read the book myself.  The author very nicely combines his personal journey through preparations for a memory contest with with backgrounds on how memory works and its role in the development of our various cultures.  This weaving of the personal with the historical works really well - much better than just about any other book on human science I've read for a long time.    Hey, I loved reading this book and it was like settling down with a mixture of stories and scientific hypotheses.  Okay, I'm biased since I work in evolutionary biology.  But I've ploughed through many books in this area that were unimaginative, plodding, or just plain wrong.  This book is imaginative, it's certainly not plodding, and its main thesis looks like it could be right.    I thought it was great!    Mike

B0052UZIFA|1.0|I guess you have to buy a new phone every year to keep up with all these awesome apps that are coming to the android/amazon app store. I wonder if this app doesn't work on the iphone 3g. Yes i have the OG droid and yes i will complain because to not get your app to work on a ''flagship'' device under two years of age when everyone gets a two year contract is just wrong and shows your lack of thought or inability at app porting/dev.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|After seeing the current London production of Les Miserables in April at the Queen's Theatre, we decided to get the DVD of the 25th anniversary concert.  We're not disappointed.  The concert was phenomenal, utilizing the technical capabilities of the O2 Arena, and the DVD is excellent.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I've been waiting for this game for the longest. Been tempted to download a bootleg version of this game, but I held off... and it was worth the wait. Plays like a dream. Was hoping it'd have some of the same options the PlayStation 3 version had such as multiplayer, but I guess this is good enough. Works great on my Nexus One with some minor slowdown at the completion of a level. Definitely worth a download.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|App works great on my samsung fascinate. Not sure why others with this phone are having problems. No crashes or lag while playing.
006016848X|4.0|ive been wanting to read this for years, after 3 years of marriage i finally bought it for my birthday. its a interesting way to look at relationships.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works great on droid x.  Nice graphics been waiting forever for it to make it to android.  Would love to see tablet optimized version
B0052UZIFA|5.0|OMG people, its free. Quit your crying about size and other nonsense. App2sd is real simple. Works terrific on my G2X. Plays and looks just as good as the iPhone version l.

B001AQT0OU|4.0|A surprisingly good transfer from WB.<br /><br />I was expecting a clumsy and rushed transfer from WB as part of a cash-grab package ( that<br />included Lolita ) on their just released BR Stanley Kubrick Collection.<br /><br />I'm happy to report that the PQ on this BR is beautiful.<br />Be advised that both Barry Lyndon and Lolita BRs were not given the extensive, ground-up full restoration process.<br />Nevertheless,  I'm more than satisfied with the resulting PQ from the clean and deft transfer into HD.<br /><br />The images are soft at times ( as intended and faithful to the 1975 release ).<br />Keep in mind this film was shot primarily with existing light ( using specially made ultra-fast Carl Zeiss lenses )<br />The details are intact. The black levels are deep, and the flesh tones are vibrant.<br /><br />Sunlit daylight shots look crisp with bountiful detail, especially the set battles on the green countryside with the British red coats.<br /><br />The candle-illuminated  night parlor shots are what this movie is about,  wonderful and ghostly scenes represented with ample detail of the actor's<br />faces and costume.<br /><br />The PQ  looked equally impressive on a 52\\" XBR lcd display  as well as being projected ( 150\\" screen using a Sony VPL-VW50 1080P projector ).<br /><br />SQ fidelity is delivered through  DTS-HD Master audio 5.1 with great results.<br /><br />I'm not going to join in the correct aspect-ratio debate ( 1.66:1 VS 1.78:1 ) but I'll state that the 1.85:1  printed on<br />BR box is incorrect,  the film is actually presented at 1.78:1.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />Shameful that only 1 SD trailer is supplied as the sole supplementary material.<br />The packaging is the cheapest of all the BRs I've received.  No inside card,  flimsy container with<br />cutouts in the plastic to shave cost.<br /><br />Kind of bittersweet,  I've waited so long for Barry Lyndon to arrive on BR,  and although the PQ and SQ are satisfying,<br />the flimsy packaging with 0 extras is an insult not only to Kubrick fans, but to his work itself.<br /><br />If disposable, brain-dead features like \\"Fast and Furious\\" get the royal BR treatment with all the supplementary material<br />that one could stomach,  how is it that WB treats a historically important feature from Kubrick's canon with such disdain.<br /><br />5 stars for the film<br />4 stars for the PQ and SQ<br />1 star for the packaging<br />half star for the supplementary material<br /><br />I'll keep this disc until the Criterion Collection ( hopefully soon ) gives Barry Lyndon<br />the due respect it so richly deserves on the BR platform with a full restoration.<br /><br />BTW the last 2 films in Kubrick's body of work will be available on BR Aug 16th!

B0052UZIFA|1.0|Downloaded and installed just fine... however when I went to open it, a little blue hourglass shows up for a second and then the screen is black. Can't push any buttons except for the home button. I am very disappointed as I was looking forward to playing this game.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Now, I'm sure if I was able to run the game, it would get an easy 5/5. But upon starting the app, I get PopCap's logo, the theme music in the background, and nothing else. Seeing as I got this for free, there's no real reason to complain, but it'd be great if I could get this app up and running. Patiently waiting for a patch.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Seriously. Incompatible with the motorola droid. are you serious? The Droid can do anything and everything that the new models can do with the exception of 4g and the bionic whenever it gets released. I'm highly disappointed in the developers choosing not to include the original droid.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have played this on the iPad and touch. wo. the game twice and I'm still hooked.  best app of the decade!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I can't believe they gave this away free at launch. I would have gladly paid for what is best android game. too bad it took a year too long to release. I been wanting this since I got my DROID X. was scared when description said &quot;some&quot; X. I hope no x owner misses out. sorry og
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Works awesome on my samsung epic-galaxy s.<br />game is really fun to play. At first I had trouble installing it, but now it's fine.
B003UESJF6|5.0|This one was not high on my \\"MUST SEE\\" list but the grandkids loved it and it became a nice addition to their growing collection.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I'm an avid downloader. I admit it, I steal music whenever I can.   But this... this is true art. I couldn't steal this without remorse and have never been more eager or proud to pay for music. I plan to purchase it again for a friend's birthday rather than burning a copy of my own.   The lyrics are wonderful and create visually stunning images. The vocals are strong, from her very core-- she has such a powerful sound. The music is almost magic. The harp is something one normally doesn't hear but it's so fitting with Florence + the Machine.
B004G600A4|5.0|Purchased this for the grandkids but even I really liked this one ! Great family movie that the children will likely watch over and over again.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Love this game on PC, too bad it doesn't make it past a little hourglass on my Droid Incredible.  If it did I could actually play it.    75MB, doesn't work on a bunch of phones, etc. etc. etc.  This is some really lazy porting.
1577311523|5.0|This book is as good as the credits say on the book jacket; it provides a guide to gaining insight into the abstract concept of inner peace by presenting the material in every-day modern terms that anyone can understand and relate to. This is a must read for any \\"seeker\\" no matter what religion one follows.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Been waiting forever for this to make it to android. Its a little slow loading but no other problems on my Droid X
B004IQMXD4|4.0|I am one of the biggest Stevie fans out there, but I have to say that I didnt enjoy this album as much. I may have to listen again, but it just isnt the old Stevie that I love. It doesnt matter anyways because I am a lifer! Her face is tattooed on my back, as well as her name on my ankle!!!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|This is a great port of PvsZ to the Android platform. Has all the features I lived from the PC version.  Is a very large download. Brace yourself.  Can be a bit skippy-laggy when there's a lot going on on the screen.  Overall, very happy. Would have paid a couple bucks for this had it not been today's freebie.  Running fine on my early model (Sept-Oct, 2010), nonrooted Froyo Droid X.
030726999X|4.0|The third, and final, chapter of this trilogy centers around Lisbeth's trial. Picking up mere minutes after the previous book ends, Lisbeth is transported to the hospital to recover from her injuries. She is charged with attempted murder (among other things). Mikael and her other friends set out to save her from being locked up again.<br /><br />I found this concluding book to less of a draw then the previous ones. I thoroughly enjoyed the law/courtroom aspect, but found myself tuning out during all the history lessons. I don't think they contributed to the story at all, except to make it longer.<br /><br />I love the develop of Lisbeth's character over the course of the series. You can see a slow but steady growth in her maturity and self confidence.<br /><br />I'm glad I finished the series. I'm satisfied with how everything turned out. But I doubt I'll read it again.
B0031OCY2E|5.0|At first I thought \\"The Informant!\\" would be another expose of corporate crime.    It plays like one--with a jittery voiceover by Matt Damon and realistically-ordinary shots of Decatur, Illinois factories, farms, and houses.    But it isn't--or isn't completely--an expose.    It's as much a character-study of Whitaker (Damon) as a trashing of corporate malfeasance.    The first tipoff is the music.  It's like cartoon-music, zany and manic and lighthearted.  It's so lighthearted that it's almost loony.    And that's the way Whitaker is, too.  He is brilliant, but also Eagle-Scout optimistic and wackily cheerful.    The movie does a good job of explaining a complex fraud--from the corruption of bioengineering to pricefixing to million-dollar-kickbacks.    But it does even better showing the spiral of Whitaker into delusions (that he might sell out ADM for fraud, and then become CEO, for example) and self-delusions (he tells his gardener that he is Double O Fourteen--twice as smart as Double O Seven).    Whitaker comes across as a person who believes EVERYTHING, and who confidently expects others to do the same, especially when he is spinning grandiose lies.    Most of the time, he is right.    Damon does a perfect job with the role--he is stiff, walks awkwardly, carries too many pounds, has Trump-horrible hair, and even goes BALD in prison--and of course, in the end, is even able to look on prison cheerfully as a learning experience.    Superb acting and a superb movie.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|it would be great to run the app if I was able to install it on my evo 4g. Please fix this issue
B0052UZIFA|5.0|ive loved the game for a long time its great to see it make its way to android it works and looks great on my g-tab running Mountain laurel 1.1.0
B0052UZIFA|4.0|As like it was on iOS, Plants vs Zombies is a great game. No lag for me, smooth all across the board (Samsung Fascinate by the way) and just fun, fun, fun! Yet Popcap could have done a better job porting the game.    The map, the zombies, the menus are a little fuzzy and pixelated. The only clean and smooth looking images are your plants, and if you compare it to the rest, you can easily see the difference. I'm not sure if this is consistent with all versions, but if it isn't, it should be fixed.     Overall, its a great game that can be made even better with a high-res update.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love it! It's great for when you are waiting in a doctor's office, airport, etc. You don't have to lug heavy books around everywhere you go. I also love that they offer free books!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|It is telling me this is not compatible on my device. That is really lame. I have the original motorola droid.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Worked better than expected, highly addictive. Runs a little slow when transitioning to next level, but cool other than that.
B000JMKNVK|3.0|This Lehane dialing it in I think.  He's a fantastic writer and this one starts out very strong.  The first half of the book is great but then it just falls apart with a weak reveal, weak plotting and a disappointing unsatisfying simplistic climax.      Could have been really, really good I think if he'd paid the first half off more, but the second half really feels like he dialed it in compared to his past accomplishments.    If you are new to Lehane, try something else.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|so I love this game on iPhone. I got it for Android and can't sign in. I can't type anything. WTF!!! its the simple things that piss ya off.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Evo 4G user here! The graphics are seriously lacking. There is too much pixelation at times. Sound is not great either. But what is seriously missing is the zombie that sticks his hand out of the grave when you chose a mode at the home screen! Bring him back!
0307593495|5.0|There is no doubt that Henning Mankell is one of the finest authors currently putting pen to paper today. His prestigious catalogue of work is testament to an extraordinary literary mind and a rare & gifted ability to write. His series of engrossing mystery novels featuring Swedish policeman Kurt Wallender are renowned world-wide, and have been published to wide acclaim. These are the facts. However, judging from some of the reviews posted here, there are divergent opinions on the substance and quality of his latest Wallender novel, The Troubled Man. Much is made of the the suggestion that this will be the final in the Wallender series - the final chapter strongly suggests this in a manner that will no doubt agrieve many Wallender fans. Lilian suggests that The Troubled Man is \\"A tired end for a fine series\\", while Zenreader describes the book as \\"not a book you can read by itself & enjoy\\". I beg to differ on both counts. With The Troubled Man, Henning may well have brought the series to an end, but he has done so in the most natural & dare I say, sensitive way. Wallender has simply aged, as do we all. And in The Troubled Man, we are given a most sincere & sensitive insight into the infirmities of oncoming old age. His diabeties, his blackouts, his frequent memory lapses, all these combine to bring home the reality of his advancing years, leaving him at times distressed and fearful. It is clear that he is scared of growing old, of losing control of himself, & in turn, his precious independence. As a result, there is a very dark & sombre thread that runs through The Troubled Man as the all too human side of Wallender is prsented to us. Yet despite all this, The Troubled Man is still a triumph in detection. Wallender may be aging quickly, but not so Henning Mankell. Whilst it is slow going in places (appropriate for an aging Wallender), I found The Troubled Man impossible to put down, and if in fact, it is Wallender's curtain call, then there can be no more fitting tribute to this fictional icon, than The Troubled Man. Certainly, some fans of Wallender will find the ending to The Troubled Man sad & distressing, but personally, I'm very grateful to Mankell for allowing me to share in those private aspects of Wallender's 'coming of age'. Like most fans, I will miss Wallender, but I'm thankful that we had him for the short period of time that we did. I think he made us all look at the fictional policeman in a new and different way.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Do yourself a favor and get this game. Its simple enough that anyone can play, buy has enough challenge to keep you busy for a long time.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I've bought 2 or 3 variations of this game on PC, iPhone, and now Android.  This is by far the most disappointing of them all.  Graphics are terrible compared to my buddies ipad version.  Doesn't run at all on my old HTC Hero.  Crashes and freezes on my Viewsonic Gtab.    If this game is useless on high end tablets and low end phones, then who is it for? I'd have been screwed if the app hadn't been free.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Five stars for porting it finally (-1 for not trimming down at least a playable level for older devices). Bad PopCap+Amazon trying to force an upgrade (this phone is still awesome, btw).<br /><br />I can't play it yet (original droid), and can't purchase it from my device (why, Amazon?). I was able to purchase it from the web interface, and will review it further when I can play it. I love this game, even bought the edition with the mini zombie figure when it first became available (will likely spend another $20 just for that sunflower fig). Can't wait to see what PopCap has done with it for the Android.<br /><br />Great original game, love seeing it ported, bad delivery experience. Still a net positive, but that will sour if this behavior starts to trend.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Hope people who purchased this before 2 am are getting a refund. It might be only three dollars but it's the moral behind it more than being out of pocket.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Just the right amount of head scratching and game length, it is a mobile game afterall. First go through might take a little while, subsequent runs will be a breeze.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Download and install went fine. Now when I open it all I get is an hour glass, then the screen goes blank and the game closes. HTC evo.
0307887960|4.0|This is a diet that is not hard to follow. It is simple and can help lose  weight with excersise. Ilost an additional pouund a week with what I was alreaedy doing.

Everyday items at home or in your grocery store.<br /> Excersice is an important part of every diet. Easy to read and follow.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|took quite a few tries to get the thing to download and install - kept timing out on me. BUT finally got it installed and it runs great on my Droid Incredible.  I have tons of open space on my phone since i only have a handful of things on it, so I dont know if that contributes to the smooth playing experience. I love this game and I love that I could get it for free!
B002ZG983M|5.0|I'm not a Nicholas Cage fan either.  I had every reason not to like this film but I was surprised and delighted.  I've watched it 5 times in a month - now I can't get the soundtrack out of my head.    Well written, well done in every way.  It's a kind of dark action comedy with a \\"we ain't gonna take it anymore\\" theme.  A misfit nerd and little girl take on the forces of evil.      I can't sit through \\"Iron Man\\", any of the Hulk movies, \\"Sin City\\", \\"X-men\\", or anything remotely connected to comics, yet this will probably become, next to \\"Love Actually\\", my most-watched film.    I want the sequel now!
B00000F169|2.0|I wanted to like it, I truly did. But the movie is just bad. Almost everything in it was bad. Okay I get the plot. People blow planets into pieces that might create Super Nova's, as they go off their orbits. Okay. So what about an alien? It's a jumping orange beach ball with two legs that is filled with air. What I liked about the movie was the artificial intelligence. The talking computer on the board of the ship and the bombs. Yes, talking bombs. And the bomb #20 will be especially smart. The movie runs 1h:22mins. It is not much, but I must say that it is very slow. There is almost no action in it or performance is too bad. The movie was done with a budget of 55.000$. And the ship model was more or less beautiful.
B000003NA3|5.0|In my order of preference:<br /><br />1) John Coltrane, The Complete 1961 Village Vanguard Recordings<br /><br />2) Miles Davis, The Complete Live at the Plugged Nickel 1965<br /><br />3) Cecil Taylor, Nefertiti, The Beautiful One Has Come (Live at the Cafe Montmartre, Copenhagen 1962)<br /><br />And, since jazz is the greatest musical genre, these are the three greatest live recordings, period. :-)

B004RKXN44|5.0|I had never been a big Hawke/Sienna fan; I was a bit squicked by their age difference and how immature the teenage X Psy seemed to be. However, I was shocked by how good, dare I say even \\"epic\\", this book was. Their romance was 100% convincing, and the action way more intense than previous books. The Psy agenda didn't feel like an obligatory addendum to the main story, it felt necessary and actually exciting. At any case, it would be worth it just for the appearances of Judd, Walker, Lucas, and Sascha.     I still can't get over how chill-inducing and romantic the story was! An amazing book.

B00425S1H8|5.0|These worked flawlessly in my Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit laptop.  Just plugged them in and it looked like Windows checked for updates, installed the drivers, and they were ready to use.  I think one defaulted to COM4 and the other to COM5.  I am using two of them with a StarTech DB9 RS232 Serial Null Modem Adapter (NM9FF) in a loop-back setup.  My software uses one of the ports and a device emulator is running on the other port.  Good price and fast shipping.  I have 4 or 5 older USB to serial adaptors and couldn't get them to work at all in Windows 7.  It was just easier and took less time to get new ones.  I think the main difference is this Prolific 2303 series chiset.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|My device, Droid Incredible, is not listed in the unsupported phones list, yet the game would not load. I was very excited to have a portable copy of this and then when I started it it went through the loading and played the intro music, but would not leave the pop cap logo screen. I understand having hardware issues with older phones but if the phone is not listed in the unsupported devices, it should at least run, even if it looks like crap doing so.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I've played this game as a demo on my brother's computer and LOVED it. Turns out I had it home hiding in a pile of unopened 360 games. I found that the controller hindered the gameplay. Searching the Marketplace I was really disappointed to find that although it was available to iPhone users it wasn't for the Droid2. I ended up buying it for my DS. The graphics were lacking and when playing with a hoard of zombies and a gaggle of plants it got pretty laggy. It wasn't pretty but it got the job done. This version is by far the best. I'm so happy! Now I can play everywhere I go without having to tote my DS around, sacraficing asthetics for addiction. Hurray!

I quickly bought the second book in the series, The Wise Man's Fear IN HARDBACK which I rarely do but I couldn't wait. I was disappointed to find that Mr. Rothfuss does not have other books available! I highly recommend this series.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works great on my Evo! Such a fun game. There is even some strategy involved.I think it's definitely worth $3. Use plants to keep zombies from coming in to your house and eating your brains. I absolutely recommend this game!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|IV been waiting for this to come out so long it works great you can play for hours only thing that needs fixing is when u beat a level when it shows you what you found it kinda lags just a little but its still noticeable overall great game and looking forward to plants vs zombies 2 on the Droid ;)

0143116738|3.0|This book was okay.  About 20 examples of famous people who had found their \\"Element\\".  I was looking for \\"how to find my 'element'.  How will you ever know and how do you reach that level?

B004DI7HZ6|3.0|...so, so badly. I was so excited when I read the description because I am a huge fan of all supernatural literature, especially witches. Grown up Harry Potter, anyone? Unfortunately (and my heart breaks to write this)instead of a clever, fun novel, Discovery of Witches made me ANGRY.     I was unaware that the book was over 600 pages when I purchased it, but if the story is a good one, then I feel the longer the better. It started out quite promising, as Diana accidently calls the manuscript in the Bodleian, but as other reader's have pointed out, the plot remains stagnant for a while. If this book was a marathon, then the entire terrain (save maybe three tiny foothills) is a flat wasteland.     The thing that I am MOST upset about is the ending. ARE. YOU. SERIOUS? I just read this entire book and watched the little percentage button on my kindle eerily creep closer to 100% as I continue to read pages of nothingness? REALLY? The only reason I would suffer through a sequel is because I really want to know what happens. If I had known this book had a sequel (or is part of a trilogy or WHATEVER), I would have never read it.    Also, I don't know what kind of woman the author is, but (as other females can attest) it would be nearly impossible to clear your home of any strands of hair. I shed when I run my fingers through my hair. so she is crazy.    Done. Phew.
0321127420|4.0|I am very impressed with the book condition.  It was mentioned as 'Good' but it's as good as a new book.  No need to mention about the content of the book, because it's must book for any body looking for patterns.  Overall very happy with this book purchase.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|...that left me a little bit disturbed (but in the best way!)\\"Room\\" was a book that I could not stop thinking about, even when I was done reading it. You hear stories on the news (a la Elizabeth Smart) and wonder what really happens. \\"Room\\" gives readers a look at the relationship between mother/son and the naivety of a society so enthralled with heartbreak.     Great read...not your average lazy day book, but would definitely recommend.
0345529057|1.0|Although I freely admit that Mr. Martin is extremely talented, the language in his books, and the complete lack of any moral fiber made me stop reading them. Incest, rape, murder, etc,... all described in great deal made my stomach turn. I finally took them all back to the library because they actually made me feel soiled. He could have written these books on a much higher level. Give me Edddings, Sanderson, Tolkien, Jordan and others. I actually feel sorry for someone who thinks in such dark ways. You can be a great writer without being so vulgar and crass. So if you have higher standards in words and morals, avoid his books. They could have been so good.
0802798225|5.0|Can I just say that I literally JUST finished this book and I already wanna pick it back up and read it again? ( I just might)  Can I also add that this book is now my Favorite? Oh and that its perfect? and that I might just freak out over this book for a very long time?<br /><br />ya this book was THAT good, I don't even think I could write a review good enough to give this book its justice...it was honestly just so compelling and so beautiful, it makes you realize you can never judge a person based off of how they look..or even act. It makes you realize any love is possible<br /><br />That is literally all I'm gonna write...cause to me it seems pointless to write a long review when in the end it wont even sum up how good and how much I loved this book.<br /><br />Blah I am just gushing with happiness over this book! :D MUST READ.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|works ok on Nexus S running a custom CM7 KANG     however the game has twice deleted my save file once when i was 3-2 and once at 2-3 totally not cool.     game does not remember volume/sfx settings i have to adjust them every time i open it    if i try to listen to music using music beta (untested with other music apps) music playback stops when game is running    i received a phone call while playing the game paused (as it should) when i tried to reopen the game it made my phone freeze and i had to do a battery pull to fix it
B0052UZIFA|5.0|love this game. I've had it on my laptop for 2 years. No problems on my Evo. I agree with some of the comments I've read like if you stop playing the screen shuts off. also the screen does looked stretched. my wife has a nexus s 4g that has a slightly smaller screen (4.3&quot; to 4&quot;) it look better...yes I know the nexus s has a higher Res screen but mine looks more stretched than hers. we also have an old iPhone 3s and it look better on the even smaller screen of the 3s.  a huge thanks for everyone that has a phone with a small amount of memory by being able to move this to external storage.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Best part that it's free today. But even if it wasn't, this game is addictive, if you like the strategy-type games. Just fun. Killed 1½ hours when I first downloaded it.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|It wont let me install the update!  Why????  I am not a computer nerd who knows how to get around this problem!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Either be pop cap or combo with Amazon, there should be some software/app support in this case.<br /><br />For me I am running on a Nexus One running base gingerbread 2.3.4 on the latest MIUI runing data2SD.<br /><br />All my other apps downloaded from amazon work fine, this is the first app that has some running issues. And my problem is mostly the app running in in landscape mode, first with a hourglass and then the main load screen pops up but with only shows 1/3 of the screen and very laggy. Additionally I have since uninstalled, reboot and reinstalled. From doing that, I would get an hour glass, a black screen and then goes to my homescreen.
B003UESJF6|5.0|This is a fun film for kids and adults.  As always DreamWorks and he artist who worked on this film did an outstanding job.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|great tower defense game, one of ky favorites across all platform. Bravo to amazon for getting us this game before the android market.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|So excited to see this as today's free app.  Downloaded with no problems, works great on the xoom.  Graphics are not the greatest but I'm fine with it.  Still very entertaining.    Update: Can not stop playing!
B0017I1FNK|5.0|No one can sing more sweetly about sadness and loss. Emmylou's angelic voice finds a perfect niche in the melancholy but somehow comforting songs on this album.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Great game . . . or it would be if it worked right on the Droid X. Program goes to &quot;loading&quot; screen constantly during game play so that it takes five or ten minutes to play one level. If this game was compatible on everything, it would deserve five stars. Getting it for free was wonderful but I'm glad I didn't pay for a glitchy game.
1439108277|5.0|I have very little doubt that any university freshman who has had Professor Lewin for any physics courses will never forget the experience. Why? The book's cover says it all. In the first 69% or so of the book, Professor Lewin discusses basic physics - touching upon various topics such as Newton's Laws, gravity, optics, sound, electricity, etc. The physics is very elementary such that a science buff is not likely to learn anything new here. But the highlight of these discussions is the joy of discovery that they impart to the reader. The author's enthusiasm and amazement for his subject matter is truly exceptional. Throughout, he describes various demonstrations that he's done in class in order to illustrate some particular points - and relishes his students' reactions. He goes out of his way to ensure that the students have fun and will remember what they've seen. Also located in the earlier part of the book is a bit of autobiographical information: mainly Professors Lewin's childhood in his native Holland during World War II and how difficult and horribly tragic life was at that time.<br /><br />In the next few chapters, comprising about 27% of the book, Professor Lewin discusses his professional life and achievements in x-ray astronomy. This was a treat for me because, once again, his enthusiasm does not cease to grace every page and the details that he provides were mostly new to me. Finally, in the last chapter, he discusses mainly his love for modern art.<br /><br />Written in clear, very friendly and lively prose, this book should be of particular interest as much to high school students and university freshmen for the clear information that it contains as to the seasoned science buff for the way it is expressed and for the information on the discovery and evolution of x-ray astronomy. If all science classes were taught like Professor Lewin teaches his physics classes, there would probably be more scientists in the world.
B004TACMZ8|4.0|Boy, we sure could have used this when we installed our HDTV on the wall! We had to do it old-school and tap the walls looking for the best place to bolt the mount. It worked out ok, but this sure would've made it easier! I played around with it and was able to find wood, steel and electrical with ease. The indicator circle changes from green, yellow and red, and the LCD display shows how close to the target you are. It works pretty well. Incidentally, I did recheck our HDTV mount, and we hit it spot on, even old-school style. But this would've given me more peace of mind, as I was never quite sure we did it right. Now if we ever get a 3D HDTV, I'll have this to help with the mounting. I don't suspect I'll use it much, but it's nice to have. And it comes with a cool case too. Just wish the user manual wasn't printed on such cheapo paper; very thin and tears easily and is too big to fit in the case, so I folded it in half. But otherwise, this is a good product.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Though this season diverged from the books even more than the first season, I thought it was the best of the two. Richard and Kahlan's relationship becomes deeper and more 3 dimensional, and the inclusion of Cara into the entourage was superbly done.<br />This show was unfairly cut down in it's prime, I hope someone picks it up for a season 3 .. and 4, and 5..
B003UYUQZW|1.0|As a huge fan of the Prince of Persia video game series and Jake Gyllenhaal, of course I watched this film.  Although I can't fault the film for its great visuals, what makes this flick truly abysmal is the fact that no attention was paid to plot or logic at all.  I'm willing to suspend disbelief for a good romp at the movies, but there's a fine line between suspension of disbelief and nonsensical writing.<br /><br />The movie jumps around erratically and makes no explanations for the gaping holes that emerge in the plot.  I'll give you a perfect (non-spoiler) example.  Jake Gyllenhaal's Dastan is on the lam after being accused of being responsible for his father's demise.  The whole kingdom is looking for him, so of course he heads back to the kingdom where many other kingdoms are gathering for the king's memorial.  A funeral procession is marching down the street.  We see Dastan traipsing across the tops of buildings and down through alleyways, completely unnoticed.  Okay, that's fine.  The games were filled with such feats of stealth.<br /><br />But after a quick cut, Dastan is suddenly kneeling over his father's casket and paying homage.  I should point out here that his father's casket is in a canopy that is being carried down a busy street as the focus of a procession that includes foreign dignitaries, royal court, guards, and so on all walking nearby.  His father's brother/advisor is walking next to the casket.  Dastan spends a moment or two speaking to his father's remains then flees the canopy.<br /><br />Yes.  That means that Dastan was able to slip past an entire crowd of people standing at the side of the road, slink unseen into the canopy his father was being carried in, the men carrying the canopy didn't notice the shift in weight at all, Dastan isn't heard through the canopy only inches from his uncle's ears, he then exits the canopy and leaves back through the crowd with nary a dignitary or onlooker spotting him.  Oh...and he also slipped a note into his uncle's pocket through the canopy's gaping flap without notice.<br /><br />I wish I could say that this was the only moment in the film that made little to no sense.  The special effects are stunning but without a story (or at least a vague semblance of continuity) to ground them, they're nothing more than pretty lights and sounds.<br /><br />I know some people enjoy movies like this.  They like watching the great fight sequences with their stunning choreography and CG effects.  If you prefer your films driven primarily by the effects department, then you can ignore my review and you'll probably enjoy this film.  But if you like a good story that you can follow and that doesn't leave you wondering if the director actually read the script before shooting, then I'm willing to bet you will be less than enthused about this shamble of a pseudo-adaptation.ugh the canopy's gaping flap without notice.

B002GY9F9K|5.0|Not a lot left to say that hasn't been said already, but it's a great series.  Sure, it's not entirely faithful to the books but it was still the best thing out there by far.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I'm glad that I was able to download this for free.  If I had paid for it and saw how terrible and low res the graphics were I would have been way more dissapointed. Im holding out hope that the developers come to their senses and issue an update that addresses this.  N1
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Soul Surfer is a brilliant, inspirational, and moving true store based on the amazing life and example of Bethany Hamilton. It will lead you to a more wonderful place of faith, hope, and love. The cast is outstanding and the end of the movie contains a wonderful surprise!
B004RQVVGU|5.0|After the debacle that was the 2002 re-recordings of this and _Blizzard Of Ozz_, I was a bit skeptical about this and whether or not this was going to be doctored.    No need to worry; the original bass and drum tracks are intact and all's well.      Couple of interesting things, which I suppose can be applied to both releases:    Curious that neither Lee Kerslake or Bob Daisley are credited anywhere in the booklets (other than writing or production).  Wonder if this is some kind of omission to prevent them receiving recognition for their work?  Dunno.  Just seemed kinda odd.    Also--given that this was done as a 2 disc Legacy edition, Sharon--ya think maybe you can get around to doing up Blizzard as a 2 disc edition and give a good home to the versions of \\"Mr. Crowley\\" and \\"Suicide Solution,\\" plus \\"You Said It All,\\" from the _Live EP_?  It's a thought.      Regardless--five stars and a big thanks for putting these out.  Great stuff!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|The last 3 things I attempted to purchase from Amazon are only available in the US and I've been refused sale outright. I live 30km north of the border -- the division is arbitrary and has been an intensely negative customer experience for me repeatedly.    I don't think I'll be purchasing from Amazon for some time until arbitrary policies like this are removed and I'll be contacting PopCap to let them know that there are 6.481 billion people living outside the USA, some of which would also like to purchase their applications.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great game, an easy way to loose an hour without realizing it.  Stutters occasionally on my Droid X, but even when the screen is full it usually runs nice and smooth. This is the fourth platform I've bought the game on, and it still is fun.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|this would be a great time killer, if it didn't freeze and occasionally restart my phone! tried to move from sd card to phone but still fails!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|fun and it runs great on my g2x.  i got it when it was free but would gladly pay the 2.99.  well worth it.
B004SBX112|3.0|I paid the dollar to update my free version to the &quot;ad-free&quot; version on Amazon but while I am not getting those awful ads over the score/playing field I am getting redirected to ads after about every 10th game. Anyone else having this problem?
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I was wondering if this game would ever come around. Plays great on my HTC Incredible, no lag, the graphics are great and of course the game is fun. I haven't run into any issues.   I don't understand some of these reviews when the description tells you if it won't work on your phone, and giving a 1 star rating for a Wifi download has to do with Amazon, not the game itself,  send an email to Amazon. It's a large file, and we'll worth the download.
0061990477|5.0|I really loved this book. I got into the story right from the beginning and would recomend it to anyone.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|The gameplay is good and everything but it erased my adventure mode progress and I have to start the whole game over again. :(
B0052UZIFA|5.0|First and foremost, for all the idiots out there rating this game 1 star for it not running, please throw yourselves out on the lawn, you'll save me some Wall-Nuts. Rating a product that you technically haven't even used yet is, well, dumb. I got my Droid X on the release date last year and besides some other hiccups with the phone (which aren't relevant to this review), the game runs fine.<br />Moving on to the actual game review, it is a standard tower defense type game with plants and zombies. Addicting, as you'll want to restart levels so you can make sure you don't use your last line of defense, or save your cute little plants from being eaten by the zombies (I guess zombies CAN be omnivores, there is hope for the human race yet!). I haven't had the chance to play through the entire game, and am still on the front lawn, but I can tell that this game is going to offer enjoyment and possible frustration for less-apt and apt strategists alike out there. BRAINS!!!!! or Plants, whatever is closest :b.
B004NSVF7C|5.0|This book not only inspired me but also made me want to read more. I look forward to reading more books in the future. The man must of loved books. I don't know but it was a great book.
B0040HJNKC|5.0|Like B.B. King on his latest album One Kind Favor, Buddy Guy here comes up with his strongest contribution to the blues in two decades. Not since the Grammy winning album Damn Alright.. have I heard him so full of energy and devotedness. He plays and sings a dozen songs, each of them different and challenging enough to hold my interest throughout the album. My favourites? \\"74 Years Young\\" is a song with both acoustic guitar and hard playing distorted guitar. The title song \\"Living Proof\\" is just great. And who would expect a rock'n roll tune like \\"Too Soon\\" from a man of his age? There are also slower songs. His voice never stops being interesting and on edge. He would have been a great artist even without his guitar. B.B. King's guest appearance on \\"Stay Around a Little Longer\\" is beautiful. Carlos Santana also does a great job on \\"Where the Blues Begins\\". I like the cover. I also like the lyrics telling the story of a 74 old vital blues musician, perhaps the greatest of them all. I recommend this album to all blues lovers and beyond. Hope to see you soon in Norway, Buddy!
B004V6MWFU|5.0|This year marked a landmark birthday for me - the big 40. It gives me chills to acknowledge this; time is passing at a frightening speed. This being said, much as happened in my life since first falling in love with the youthful angst of Pearl Jam. I played & sang in my own angst-filled band, traveled some, married and became a father - so many subtle layers continuously unfolding. I never lost my love for those first few albums of Pearl Jam, but I could not really relate (or) 'connect to' their more recent albums. This unique album by Eddie Vedder, however, is different. It affects me in a way that the music of my 20's can no longer do. I enjoy it more with every listen. Interestingly, I enjoy it differently with each change of environment (car, home, work, with friends). I don't tire of it... it's quietly complex and that's just what I've been waiting for from Eddie Vedder. If you can relate to any of these comments... do yourself a favor and buy this album. It's a quiet and joyful introspection that you hardly notice passing, and you'll find your finger hitting re-play again & again.
B00009YOQW|5.0|This is a fantastic toy for young kids.  I got this for my little nephew and the sound is fantastic!  It's also not as irritating a sound as other types of drums so his parents don't hate me for giving it to him!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I had never heard of this game. Before the free give away,  but I am so glad I got it.  My kids and me love it.  It might be on Angry Birds level for me.  Looks great and very cute story.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great graphics and fun, just like the web version. Simple interface changes to accommodate touch. Only slowdown I noticed is when you finish a level and get your prize (Nexus One). Looking forward to unlocking achievements!<br /><br />PS - try digging to Zombie China.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Omg I love this game would have paid but thanks amazon about time u put a good game up for free.  Haha runs amazing
0425242099|5.0|Kiss of Snow by Nalini Singh<br />* I received a copy of this book from Berkley in exchange for an honest review*<br /><br />Kiss of Snow is the most anticipated book in the Psy-Changing series and Nalini Singh does not disappoint her readers. With each book the relationships built are getting stronger and stronger, whether it's between the changelings, the mate bonds or their psy contacts and this one is no different.<br /><br />Sienna has been in love with Hawke since she first set eyes on him but she knows that she can never be his mate.  All she wants is for him to see her as an adult, not the child he still thinks she is.  She is a good solider because of training she received as Ming's prot&eacute;g&eacute; but she wants more.<br /><br />Hawke had to assume the reigns as the alpha of the SnowDancer pack at the age of fifteen.  He lost his mate at a young age and he has resigned himself to never have anyone of his own.  His wolf wants Sienna but the man will not allow himself to take her.  She defies him every chance she gets, she stands up to him and yet he still won't bite.<br /><br />Sienna is such a complex character.  She has learned to live since her family defected from the psynet.  She is now nineteen and her powers are becoming more and more unstable with each day that passes but she determined to make Hawke see her as a woman, his woman.  She is strong and independent but terrified that she will harm the ones she loves when she loses control of her powers.<br /><br />Hawke has the weight of the world, or at least his pack on his shoulders.  Not only did he have to take over the pack as a teenager but he lost his mate at a young age.  He believes that his chance at love died with Rissa but his wolf has other ideas and wants to claim Sienna.  He gives so much of himself to his pack that there isn't a lot left over and he can't keep living this way.<br /><br />Both Hawke and Sienna are about to blow just in different ways.  They have been dancing around each other so long; it's time to do something about it.  Sienna is the perfect match for the alpha of the pack.  She is able to stand up to him and doesn't let him get away with much, while being a strong sounding board regarding strategic plans for the pack.<br /><br />There are several things going on all at once in this book, yet Hawke and Sienna's story always stays at the forefront.  The pack is such an integral part of Hawke that this book would not be complete without including them.  Fans will love getting to see what their favorite mated pairs are up to.<br /><br />There are so many little moments in this book that are special and pull the reader further and further into their world.  The near misses between Hawke and Sienna add fuel to the fire threatening to consume them.  I believe the issue with the mating bond was handled brilliantly, while not disappointing, and the ending was superb.<br /><br />Kiss of Snow is without a doubt my favorite book in the Psy-Changeling series to date.  Nalini Singh is a wonderful writer that understands what her readers want and is able to deliver time and time again.  If you have not read this series, I highly recommend it.  I give Kiss of Snow 5 Flaming Hearts.nna is the perfect match for the alpha of the pack.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|wow.... twice now it has erased my progress.... erases user name and progress.. galaxy tab I don't get it.. please fix
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great game.  Thanks amazon for making this free.  Works well on the droid x.  Even on sd card.  Love this game.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|That about sums it up.  The game is lots of fun and hard to put down.  By far the best free game from Amazon so far.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|The game itself is the funniest, quirkiest tower defense game ever made. I already completed it twice on other versions. However the Android version suffers from being done to quickly. I've only played a few levels, and while the gameplay in general seems to run OK, the end of level animation drops to less than 1 fps on my Motorola Xoom, the most powerful Android device available. This isn't good enough. While the game is brilliant, it's pretty obvious PopCap skipped most of the QA, since something like this obvious bug made it through. But buy it anyway, great fun and I'm sure the problems will be patched quickly.
160094048X|5.0|Much like the cupcake book by the same authors, this is a great cook book whether you are vegan or not. I am not vegan and have a love of sugar. You can't tell the cookies are made without animal products. What I like about the book (besides the recipes) is the instructions are great, and the pictures wonderful. We have had the cupcake book for about three years. It still gets used regularly I anticipate using the cookie book just as often.
B00479SVBU|4.0|The Soundfly Aux MP3 Player Car FM transmitter does exactly what it's supposed to do. I've had FM transmitters from other brands where the signal / sound would fade in and out as you drive making it pretty useless and annoying. NOT these ... it just works.  The RDS works as advertised when playing music from the SD card. Would I purchase this again? Yes .... Would I recommend to a friend? Yes, and I've already have ... Great Product ... that I also bought the Bluetooth version to connect my phone to the car's stereo and gave this one to a family member.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Loved this game on XBLA, very happy to see it as the app of the day. installed and runs perfect on both of our droid x's. Graphics are a little grainy, but I would choose that over slow gameplay anyday!!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I would have never found or have bought this app thanks. This free app thing is real great and I hope it never goes away
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Zombie appz are not my thing, but this game is awesome! Each level is increasingly difficult, yet increasingly fun!  Strategizing and time management... ohhhh my favorites in a game. Great job!!!
B001G9F9IW|5.0|Excelente Pelicula , Fotografia , Escenas , gran argumento , un drama refrescante , entretenido y una excitante historia de pasion llevada a la pantalla en escenarios Europeos y con mucha pezpicacia .
B0052UZIFA|5.0|well done conversion for android. works great on Motorola zoom. I haven't had any problems at all. music was muted by default but that was easy to resolve.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Like this game a lot, &amp; was pleasantly surprised to see it was the FAOTD today. Even though it says it might not work on Droid x, I figured it was worth a shot. Well, it worked just fine for me. There was a bit of initial lag, but after that ran pretty much flawlessly.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Excellent port. HUGE fan of the PC version. Seems to crash mid-game about 50% of the time so far.<br /><br />RE: other comments... They *DO* have wider-screen versions available on other platforms and fill the screen with Bushes/Street on the right, more \\"House\\" on the left, and move the seed packets up top (like PC version), etc.  They will probably add different screen-size options in upcoming versions. (I googled last night and saw someone having an Android Tablet preview edition of PvZ and they show a video of it.)<br /><br />Even with the bugs (that will be addressed soon, hopefully) it is an excellent game with great graphics and game play. I am thrilled to have an on-the-go version!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This awesome game has been faithfully translated to Android devices! And I was pleasantly surprised that this plays well on the mid-range Optimus line. I'd like to see the mini-games, puzzle, and survivor options added from the full PC release, but this is still a great game as is. I've played through the adventure game a couple of times on the PC and look forward to zombie killing on the go. :)<br /><br />A quick word of advice - Since you're using your hands, I suggest you pick your plants with the hand on that edge (typically left) and plant things with the other to reduce how much of the screen you're covering.<br /><br />And anyone who gives this game a one star rating because their phone isn't supported or they have issues about the permissions needs to be shot. Either rate a product on its own merits or shut the hell up! /rant
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I dont know if it's amazon or plants vs zombies, but it won't install on my aria. I want to like it but can't.
0440242401|4.0|Sophie Kinsella has a flair for creating stories that keep me deep in the story from beginning to end.  As her character went through the experience of amnesia and slowly regaining her memory, I couldn't help but contemplate, from a personal space, what that would be like.  Truly enjoyed this story and would recommend it to a friend.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is AWESOME! If you haven't experienced it yet, you seriously need to. This is definitely worth the $2.99 asking price if you're not lucky enough to pick it up for free.<br /><br />For more of my game/app reviews and the full review for Plants Vs. Zombies, look! me up at exm.nr/anthony-orale, I almost always do an extensive review of the free app of the day!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|game won't show up yet itse says it's on my htc evo. I love this game was excited for it but now disappointed please fix.
0671027344|1.0|There are so many excellent YA books out there.  This is NOT one of them.  If the author were a bit more creative, he wouldn't have had to resort to the hackneyed themes of sex, sex, more sex, and drugs, drugs, and more drugs.  BORING.  Maybe the author thinks it's sensational and exciting - it's not.  Give us something new, please!  Even better, find another job and stop writing.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I've been eagerly anticipating this game for quite some time now. Its as good as I had hoped. Now just waiting for peggle...
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|For true Foo fans...this album has been a long time coming...getting back to their hardcore roots.  There is not one bad song on this album.  I play it over and over and because I play it so loud, I think I have converted the neighbors who were not already Foo fans!!  A must buy!!!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|this game was fun for the 5 minutes I was able to play it. after level 3 it started to repeatedly freeze. I had to uninstall it.  probably would've gotten 4 stars if not for the freezing issue
B0052UZIFA|1.0|i cant believe that this won't work on a droid...silliness and irresponsible i say. cmon developers u can do better
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|While I did finish the book, I was disappointed.  I was hoping for more historical background of witches given the main characters lineage. I agree with previous reviewers who stated that this is a Twilight rip-off.  I found myself comparing vampire to vampire.I did enjoy the daemons and their particular skills. I would recommend it as a good beach read and nothing else.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|PcS is so addictive you lose track of time, it's always just one more round. Works great on my Thunderbolt. My friends love it as well.
B0035FHWSU|5.0|Just my experience - I'm on my third pair because they're great shoes. They go from my casual workplace to hiking through a stream or swimming in a river to running around the city. They wash in the washing machine with ease, and dry pretty quickly. I like them lots more than the Newport H2's, which don't have nearly so comfortable an insole (they get kinda tacky and need more frequent washing).
B003L77GGK|5.0|I have always loved scifi but scifi with horror and drama and of course two very hot guys is even better. I was a bit concerned after season five that the show was loosing it creator and guiding force, but Sara stepped up and maybe season six awesome.
044024238X|3.0|The Undomestic Goddess by Sophie Kinsella is one of those books that you read on the beach or a plane. And not a book I greatly enjoyed. It is one of those kind of books filled with details about food and plants that I love greatly, but the main character Sam really got on my nerves. She is this all star lawyer at 29 and has been at her firm for nine years. So did she skip law school? Maybe it was seven years which would make sense but I am pretty sure it was nine. Anyway this all star lawyer smartie pants cant even turn on her oven, which I for one find surprising although I guess could happen. Anyway because her desk is so cluttered she looses about 50 million quid (British author, British setting, British money) and runs away to become of all things, a house keeper. Not on purpose mind you, but still, its a pretty faulty plot. Pretty faulty but possible. I wont go into too much details in case anyone actually wants to read this book, but one part that I found particularly humorous is how quickly she learns how to cook. Sam goes from burning chickpeas in a horrendous inferno to cooking magnificent chickens.    And now for my special rating system. For as long as I can remember I have been referring to books in food terms. So for example The Undomestic Goddess I have deemed to be a potato chip. Not just any potato chip but those potato chips that are really gross and leave grease on paper towels. Those potato chips that you KNOW are bad for you but at the same time are so good that you cant pass by them in a grocery isle. That's the kind of book The Undomestic Goddess is, when your in a book store and you know you should walk by it and get something more substantial but at the same time it kind of draws you. You think to yourself \\"I'll just read a chapter in the bath or something, if I stretch it out and read in moderation is isn't THAT wrong.\\" So you get it, wonder why the price is so high, and then take it home and promptly read it in a night just like you'd eatthose potato chips, with out realizing.    Over all, as much as I have dumped on The Undomestic Goddess it isn't all that bad as long as its not the only kind of book you read. Its one of those books I read after I have just finished a heavy duty classic and want to take a breather. If you can get passed how improbable the situations are and how annoying the main character is, its a great book to read in the bath as you drift into one of those bath induced coma-like relaxation states. If any one y'all read it, please comment below and tell me what you think. I'd also love to get book suggestions, so I can read and review what you like to read.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I was just telling my friend that the Amazon free app of the day mahjig would be awesome if they put on the game plants vs. zombies. yey!
0316113077|5.0|I think this book is extremely well-written and if you follow the directions carefully, you would really surprise yourself on what you can accomplish. Elisa writes her creative ideas clearly and the photos only enhance them. I think beginners can really learn a lot about structure and useful recipes like the royal icing and the vanilla buttercream. The cake recipes are great and remember, cakes need to support themselves more than regular single-tiered/sheet cakes so these are very useful. Great photos, easy templates and original ideas. I think this book is a must have for any cake decorator - hobbyist or pro!
B004EPYZZ8|4.0|This movie is intense, a bit scary, but sends a good message. I only reccomend this to kids at least 8 or 10 years old because of the shark scene and they might get a little bit bored with it. I did get a little bored, but I still reccomend it. Although the movie is filled with women and girls in skimpy bikinis, it still sends a good message that all things are possible with God.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|when I just downloaded it, I thought the game was boring but when I finished a couple levels, I figured its actually a cool game. also, its not one of those games that u play for an hour and u beat it. I played this game for 3 hours straight and there are still many more levels till the end. the only downside is that u cannot download it on 4G network. HTC thunderbolt
B00028HBKC|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of the best films ever done on this part of Christs life.  Mel Gibson took it to the higest level he could for what really happened to Jesus on the day He took the sins of all mankind upon Himself. Every family, Christian or non-Christian should see this film. For the Christian it is a great visual reminder of just what He willing did for us all.   For the non-Christian it may just strike the most important nerve in your body to turn your life over to the One who loved you enough to die for you. Most important, and one I wish Mr. Gibson would have taken a little further, was His Resurrection. With out the Resurrection of Christ His life & death would have counted for nothing.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Fun game with fluid and easy controls. Runs very smooth on my Evo 4G. Looking forward for more games with touch screen controls, as it really worked fine on this one.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I'm a huge zombie fan and I love playing games on my droid. got this for free from Amazon and have had some fun when I needed to have some relax-time. fun game. worth the purchase if ya need a tower defense game. Mytouch 4g.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|great, evo. miui. fantastic game...runs smooth. plays great. love it. 20 word minimum. why. 16 17 18 19 20 done
B000OVLBFI|2.0|Nick Cage makes alot of movies, about every 4th one is good, the othere three, well that brings us to this one.  \\"Ghost Rider\\" is one of the worst Nick Cage movies I have ever seen, and that is saying alot.  The only good thing about this movie is that it has Eva Mendes in it.  She is pretty hot.  Other then that, dumb plot, bad acting and sorry effects.  I would have given it one star, except for Mendes.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Great game. Plays fine, but freezes phone on exit. Have to remove battery to reset phone. Please patch this game.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|If you have an older phone... this isn't for you.   Move it to your SD card.   Big,  but worth it.
0861661605|3.0|Those who liked previous volumes will like this one. I'm not that familiar with the Threepenny Opera, so I don't know if the ending here coincides with that. I will say I quite enjoyed the prose section at the end of the book, which usually isn't the case.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|MyTouch 4G. The best game on android i played so far. extremely uh oh addictive. but too short. 20 words minimum suxx. one more word, two... five six seven not enough i am tired. no more writing reviews with that twenty words minimum  and still not enough! stupid. very.
0316743003|4.0|To be suspended in disbelief and inescapably mesmerized at the same time leaves one wondering whether he is a prisoner to his skepticism or merely a captive of his amazement.  Yet, when reading this book, in such a state of gratifying confusion was I.     Not that it is sensationalized, mind you; but because so many unbelievable details behind the development of the world's most premier classified, military technology leaves you wondering why this information isn't still classified, and even more grateful it is not.  The U-2 and SR-71 spy planes, the F-117 stealth fighter, the B-2 bomber, all the crown jewels are here (although the B-2 story is merely a tangential account), as well as some other, lesser known, and not nearly as successful programs that rose and fell during the seasons of the Cold War.  Each is an amazing tale.  The engineering challenges behind the SR-71, astounding.  Even with the technologies of today, the fact they got this plane to fly without melting the airframe or roasting the pilot inside is unbelievable.  The development of stealth--from a defunct Russian research paper, through the Air Force's intelligence moles, and finally to the desk of a talented radar engineer--is a testament to the effectiveness of a technology-oriented exploitation machine.     As is this book a testament to an industrial partnership that eluded the inescapable grasp of the missile and the equally inescapable gaze of radar--all in ways that still provide an unparalleled military advantage.  And yes, the author will remind you of this fact several times, but the constant self-aggrandizement is easy to brush aside.  After all, it's easy to forgive those who were so good.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|After hearing such great reviews for this game, I was disappointed in the lack of complexity and thought needed to win. For TD newbies, it might be fun but for fans of the genre, it will feel shallow and lacking in substance.
B001VS46DC|4.0|Big fan of \\"Live in Paris\\" and her many CDs, though I wasn't knocked out by \\"Girl in The Other Room,\\" ... but that's just me.  Very appealing performance on this DVD and if you're a fan, buy with confidence.  Besides, if you've got Jeff Hamilton and John Clayton on a stage playing anything, you're hearing top-shelf players.  Beautiful video of Rio and the Bonus Feature conversations are interesting and enjoyable. Money well spent.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I am beyond happy this finally came to Android. it is just as fun and beautiful as it is on any platform. anyone who gave 1 star is a moron with an outdated device who can't read the description.
1594202842|5.0|I loved this book!! I don't agree with all of the author's methods in raising her children, but I thought she was brutally honest, voiced her opinions openly and gave insight on her parenting style. I know this book wasn't meant to be about her husband, but I would have loved to read more about his role in this family.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Firstly let me say, holy file size Batman! 75mb?!  other than that, very fun game, it would have been 5 stars but a 75mb app is huge. overall, the game itself is very fun.  takes awhile to load but does play smoothly, HTC Aria, CM7.
B004E0Z4XK|3.0|Wow.  Like many others I read a newspaper review relating this music to the spaghetti westerns of the mid and after '60's.  I'm not sure what Spaghetti Westerns others have heard, but where is the tension, the danger?  Listen to Morricone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly theme  - hear the cries of despair and fear.  Or the Ecstacy of Gold from the same film and hear the frantic sense of frustration searching thru a graveyard with thosands of graves for the one with the treasure.  The gently deceiving and forboding romanticism of Once Upon a Time In the West.  The mournful The Man with the Harmonica.  Check out the twang and chanting (and whistling) in the themes of For a Few Dollars More and A Fistful of Dollars.  The lesser known The Big Gundown (great movie of full surprises, by the way - and marginal dubbing) with its screaming theme of majesty and building tension.  Or if you really want to go there, Navajo Joe's relentness screaming torture and chanting.  Try some other composers, like Bacalov's almost corny Django vocal theme.    The present recording is more like Morricone pop, unfamiliar to many, maybe best described as Italian easy listening.  And good stuff.    The music at hand is pleasant, has a certain mournful sound on some tracks.  So, enjoy this recording, but don't expect to hear the real spaghetti western sound.    How about if someone takes Morricone's crime scores as a takeoff point? - some really interesting stuff there.  Or his horror scores?
B0052UZIFA|5.0|great game. must have. works great on Droid inc. even when underclocked. few quirks but still a lot of fun. played pc version and def prefer phone version. app to SD is a must since its a huge file. for the guy that didn't work on his dinc uninstall and reinstall. amazon saves your game so you don't have to rebuy just reinstall. we are finally getting quality games!
B00280LYHS|5.0|This was a great series and the last was probably my favorite. In the final installment the true meaning of the prophecy is revealed and the battle with the Titian comes to a head. It is definitely  necessary to read the previous four books to understand and enjoy the story and its many characters, but well worth the time. Riordan does a great job of reminding you of what occurred in the previous books with out being repetitive, though in a few instances I could have used a bit more of a reminder. He also has the great talent of writing a book that while primarily market to kids doesn't seem like a kids book while reading it by adding just enough random references that are clever if you pick up on them but don't stand out and seem awkward if you don't get the reference. As a native New Yorker I loved the random New York references. I walk by the statue on 23rd street mentioned every day but had never know about it or noticed it until a few years ago, a few others mentioned i may have to seek out and may actually think about going in the Empire State Building. I have never been that big on mythology but after reading this series I want to learn more. I cant wait to read read his next series set in this world.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I enjoyed the VD Season 1 package...but some of the episodes got stuck when I was watching them.  They weren't scratched or anything, but thought that was odd.  Only watched them once...but will watch them again to see if it was just a fluke or if  I need to order a new set.  =/
B0052UZIFA|4.0|P vs Z is one of the only fun tower defense games out there. Very diverse and tons to unlock... get it now! :-)
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I installed this app then couldn't even play it. It wouldn't even open. I would click on it, then it would kick me back out to the previous screen.
0385528752|5.0|Refreshing. Entertaining as well as insightful. Some books tell you how to manage change. Some books change you. This is one of the latter.
B004G600A4|5.0|I LOVE Tangled... it brings me back to the old school princess movies with a new school animation technique. :)
B002UXRGM0|5.0|This series is highly entertaining and informative. Just seeing some of the life in such vivid detail is so amazing. It make me appreciate even more all the wonders God has put in His creation!
B003M5AXN4|3.0|Good but unacceptable, unneccesary violence.... why do family movie makers keep screwing stuff up for kids? Just hint at the idea of a bad guy in a way that won't give us nightmares.. we'll all get it. I promise. So sad they turn great movies into SAW garbage nowadays....
B0052UZIFA|3.0|not without its quirks. it loads very slowly and the animation you get once you beat a level is slow and choppy. can't really complain though since it was free. hoping for some updates so it can run smoother. evo 4g w/warm2.2
B004SBQAN8|3.0|The story and action was actually amusing and it could have been a great family flick... however certain violent aspects left this film a rent only and non purchase item for our family. For about the same reason Speed Racer won't ever come home with us- unneccesary violence. Children and adults alike could have enjoyed this film without several parts that almost left me thinking.. huh.. \\"is this a Saw movie for school age kids?\\" One website even wrote \\"Think of it as Harry Potter meets Percy Jackson meets Twilight meets Independence Day meets The X-Files meets World Wrestling Entertainment.\\" -Reviewer Paul Asay. If only they would have taken the bits out that pushed it over the edge with the violence such as the beginning scene and the part where the evil alien tortures the human in a way.. I'll again say is fit for Saw like movies. Also where the janitor is missing and a pool of blood is being pushed around by his floor buffer/waxer/mop thing. Subtle hints are all we need to get the point of the story movie guys.. really... look at Spider Man.. it's rated PG-13 and most of it my two year old and 8 year old could watch without me worrying a bit. Number four on the other hand I'd have to edit and cover eyes and sit diligently so they don't wake up with nightmares.... it's really too bad.. other than the gruesome-ness.. it was cute.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I first played this game on my little cousin's iphone and fell in love. I am so glad I can finally play it on my android!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Game of the year edition is awesome on pc, so I know what to expect from this app: more of the same awesome gameplay, humorous graphics and sound. There's a zombie on my lawn!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games by Suzanne Collins is one of the best books I have read. The writing is just superb.  Well thought out and really interesting. I would recomend this book to anyone.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|All I get is the hour glass and then it sends me to my home screen on myTouch 4 g
B004V6MWFU|5.0|Very nice Eddie! Quite intimate and personal!My favorite song is Longing to Belong.I love the cello with the mandolin!It is not everyday you hear this instrument in modern music.George Harrison also liked this instrument.
0307887960|5.0|I bought the US version of this book because, living in the UK and following the UK book for a year, I'd heard that this was different to the original book and wanted to see what the fuss was about. Overall it is almost exactly the same as the UK version. There is a little more information in this book for vegetarians which, to my mind, should have been in the UK book. After all, we have vegetarians here too! Having lived by the tenets of Dr Dukan for the past 12 months, and successfully losing 98lbs, I would recommend this book to everybody out there who thinks they can't stick to a diet. Follow this book, to the letter, and you will not regret it.
B0045U9WPU|5.0|this book kept me hooked all the way through. i even  started crying at the end. i really hope that lauren writes a sequel and i recommend that you try this book!!
1572814136|5.0|The Radiant deck arrived last night, and I can't put it down!  I never could bond with the traditional Rider deck as the colors were so severe and harsh.  The Universal Rider bored me.  This deck is magnificent and so very intuitive.  I've bought so many decks looking for the perfect one.  The colors and images are fantastic, and the cards themselves are supple and easy to handle.  Someone posted that the backs are one-way, but mine are not.  Someone else posted that they smell funny, but mine don't.  Perfect deck!!!!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I've played this game on both iPod Touch and pc versions, and the game play between those two and on my Samsung Galaxy S aren't much different. A straightforward tower defense game where you lay out different plants in order to keep those pesky zombies from stealing your brains. The game has some silly humor (the Help section reads \\"Help for Plants and Zombies - Game When the Zombies show up just sit there and don't do anything. You win the game when the Zombies get to your houze - this help section brought to you by the Zombies\\") and the levels do get progressively difficult culminating with a boss battle with Dr. Zomboss. Also, as you progress through the game you unlock additional mini games, including Wal-Nut Bowling and survival modes.     Several other reviews mentioned that it wouldn't load at all. After playing a bit, I've noticed that it does take a few seconds longer to load, and it does have to reload every time my screen locks, but I've also noticed that the game runs much smoother than \\"simpler\\" tower defense games (Hex Defense, for example). I can have upwards of 30 individual plants shooting at the zombies and the game will not lag at all. Other games, I can have perhaps 10 individual characters firing at the same time and the gameplay will slow down significantly if not stop altogether. I am willing to sacrifice the loading time for a smooth, uninterrupted gaming experience.    The only real negative I have given this game is that if you accept an incoming call you run a chance of having all of your player data completely erased. I experienced this once, but thankfully I wasn't too far along in the game yet. I can see how accepting a call might reset the level (which, if you exit the game or close it using a task killer, it does), but erasing entire game data seems like something programmers can avoid with a few simple lines of data. I will be submitting a bug report, and I hope in the future I can give them back the one star that this issue took away.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|What more can you say?  It's Plants vs Zombies on Android.  Works just as well as the iOS version, with maybe a touch more lag at the end of a round.  Game play seems as smooth as ever, however, at least on the HTC Evo.  If you don't already have PvZ, then this is a must-buy.  Otherwise, it doesn't seem to bring much new to the table for those who have already played.
037582913X|5.0|I loved this book when I was a kid.  It was the one book that I would read over and over and over.  I would study the pictures of Grover trying to stop you from turning the pages.  Great book.  I loved reading it to my children and will look forward to reading it to my grand-kids in the next decade or so.<br />This is a MUST HAVE book for your child's library!!!!
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|Its a must see movie, took me years to see it us i thought it was about math hahahaha.  Watch this flick!!!!
B004GJDQT8|1.0|please make it looks as good as ios version. I dont know whats so hard on making an app look as good as ios.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|love it! only thing is my phones screen  sleeps then i have to reload the game. other than that its fun as hell
B001DPC4R8|3.0|Guess what? Everyone reading these reviews knows what's on it and has already made up their mind whether they like it or not, no thanks to any of you. In case some of you aficionados haven't noticed, this record is over 30 years old, but hey, thanks for your invaluable updates. How about you amateur music critics give it a rest, do the listening masses an actual service and instead of talking about music we're all well aware of with your noses in the air, YOU TRY LETTING US KNOW IF THE BLESSED 180 GRAM PRESSING IS ANY GOOD?    Crimminy. This is almost as bad as the reviews for Dark Side of The Moon; you'd think some of you people found out about these songs last week.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Downloaded.but it wont start. I get the loading screen then my phone goes black and.returns to my app screen. Bummer I liked it on google tv. Samsung galaxy s
0811875555|5.0|Since the moment I received the art book, I was totally impressed by the artistic level of gesture, color, creativity and design the team behind Tangled achieved. Every page I take a look at, the more immersed I am in the art of Tangled. This is definitely one of my favorite art books in my collection and absolutely recommend it to any other animator or Disney fan, actually anyone who takes a look at this book will be totally absorbed by it's content.    From presentation to artistic content, perfect.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I already own 3 copies of this game on different platforms (iOS, Xbox360, PC), and I would gladly play the whole thing again on android. It's just that good.
0425242099|5.0|First off...if you haven't read the first nine books which I have listed below please do.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0425212866 Slave to Sensation (Psy-Changelings, Book 1)]]<br />[[ASIN:042521575X Visions of Heat (Psy-Changelings, Book 2)]]<br />[[ASIN:0425218422 Caressed By Ice (Psy-Changelings, Book 3)]]<br />[[ASIN:0425220168 Mine to Possess (Psy-Changelings, Book 4)]]<br />[[ASIN:0425223256 Hostage to Pleasure (Psy-Changelings, Book 5)]]<br />[[ASIN:0425226735 Branded by Fire (Psy-Changelings, Book 6)]]<br />[[ASIN:0425231119 Blaze of Memory (Psy-Changelings, Book 7)]]<br />[[ASIN:0425235440 Bonds of Justice (Psy/Changeling Novels)]]<br />[[ASIN:0425237796 Play of Passion (Berkley Sensation)]]<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend just jumping into this series.  The first books up until Kiss of Snow really do build the world and give you an understanding of the relationship between the many wonderful characters.<br /><br />If you are looking for a detailed synopsis of the book this won't be that type of review...sorry.<br /><br />I have been anxiously awaiting the arrival of this book.  I was not - repeat - was not disappointed.  A lot of times you will wait and anticipate a book and feel that it wasn't enough.  Either you get too much fighting and struggle between the characters - which leads to the hurry up already feeling, or it was put into a nice little box with a bow too quickly that you don't feel fulfilled when you finish reading the book.  I was not left wanting.  Nalini Singh did a fabulous job.<br /><br />The struggle between Hawke & Sienna to be together was great.  At times I was rooting for them and the next I was trying to see a way around the obstacles.  They kept up with the playful banter and that is something that I have grown to love about these two.  She wants him and he wants her, but they each have their own obstacles to overcome and then they have obstacles to overcome as a couple.  It was a true whirlwind in that I couldn't put it down.  I was sucked in from the first and didn't want to stop until I was done.<br /><br />I have no complaints about this book.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|don't complain if ya cannot get this to work, get a decent phone. is like your trying to run Windows 7 on a Pentium and complaining that it won't install.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is a great movie for any animated film lover.  Of course it is a bit more graphic than most \\"family\\" films, but not so much so that you can't enjoy it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I'm addicted, the game works great on my EVO shift. i've been waiting for this game to come to android for a year now and i'm not disappointed.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|works great on my droid x! i love this game! i am so addicted! love, love, love love, love, love it!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This works awesome on evo 4g. Save to sd card is great as it is a huge file. Lower end phoneso and some tablets won't work....  Rules on htc evo.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I've played this online, thought it was a cute game. Yes, it's a big download, but it installed to my SD card and takes up 736 kb on my Optimus S. It's a little slow loading, but runs great after initial load.
1596680199|5.0|I own about 30-35 polymer clay books and this one is the best of them all. It explains easily many techniques - some easy for beginners, some better for those with experience, but overall this book would keep you very busy trying new things.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|It's sad that emulator developers realize the motorola droid has the potential to be a high end device, with its 1.25 ghz capable processor and a quadrant score exceeding that of the Nexus S on 2.2 (mine reaches 1400+), yet new developers scoff at the most popular android device and deem it unworthy for their apps. It's rather ironic really; in their attempt to create some sort of 'elite' app and exclude very capable phones, the developers actually lose business from negative reviews and people like myself who won't buy the app. For your reference, I successfully downloaded and ran the app  when it was free on my motorola droid, only to find it force close with 2 short unhelpful entries in the system logs. What a shame...
B004M3H17Q|5.0|As one reviewer mentions, James Blake gives us a soulful sound on this album.  I have not listened to his music before now and it was kind of dumb luck on my part to have stumbled upon this little gem.  The music makes me think of a lazy Sunday where all the week's work has been completed and it's time to just sit back, relax, and reflect back, with pride, on all the hard work you've done.  This album feels full with heavy emotion as if Blake is singing his most intimate secrets to life.  In some tracks he successfully infuses some sounds of slow electronica (Lindisfarne I is reminiscent of Laurie Anderson's \\"oh Superman\\")and I can't help but think he is influenced by blues and gospel as well.  It all flows together quite nicely.  If you are looking for a nice change of pace then this may be a nice way to take a break from your usual music scene.  This is not typical of my musical choices- perhaps you will take that jump into something surprisingly different like I have and have a similar outcome.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game would totally be worth the full price. I've been playing it for two hours straight. I'm sure that a lot of the low reviews are from people with older phones because i haven't had any problems. The file is quite large, but after i moved it to the SD card, it's only taking up about 250k which is nice. nexus s 4g
B002XTXFU8|5.0|Bronson is one of the best movies I've seen in a great while. The camera angles and crazy story line make this product a must have for any collection. Tom Hardy's acting capabilities show that he is a force to be reckon with, especially with his natural ability to catch the audiences attention. As a viewer I didnt know much about the story of Michael Peterson (Bronson) but this film definitely brought some insight into the mind of England's most expensive inmate.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I expected at least 720 p or something to make such a huge download worth my time searching for wifi.
B002ZG9968|3.0|I had a hard time reviewing this one, because there are some good parts and some bad parts. Of course it is overly predictable and cheesy, like every other romantic comedy.  There were definitely some funny parts. Overall, it's entertaining and worth watching. The things I did not like were:  1. The way Stan acted when she told him she was pregnant was kind of silly. He accused her of lying, even though she didn't lie. They had only been on one date, and he's acting like they were some sort of serious couple.   2. At first I was happy that they were going to show a natural home birth (you don't see that very often in movies), but that was ruined by the fact that the whole thing was portrayed as some sort of hippie ceremony. Everyone was freaking out and basically overreacting to the situation, playing the drums, singing, and screaming. And of course, they had to put the part in there about the bowel movement, but they probably wouldn't have done that if it had been a typical hospital birth (anything for laughs I guess). The worst part of all was the reaction of Zoe and Stan. Zoe freaks out and acts completely immature and childish, as if seeing childbirth is some sort of scary disgusting thing. Stan acts like he is traumatized and comments that he \\"never wants to see that ever again.\\"  Seriously? I saw 2 births by the time I was 16. Do the producers of this movie really think people are that immature?  3. After they broke up and Zoe goes to talk to him, Stan goes on and on about how she \\"broke his heart.\\" Come on! They had only been broken up for a day or two, and he acted like he had been sitting at home sobbing for months.   4. They just *had* to incorporate Jennifer's Lopez's butt into the storyline.   5. There is a scene where her friend says something like \\"you don't even want to know what pregnancy does to your bladder.\\" And then proceeds to laugh and say she \\"just peed a little.\\" It seems like they were trying to incorporate \\"pregnancy humor\\" into the movie without getting too graphic, but anyone with any knowledge of it knows that this has nothing to do with the bladder. It is has to do with pressure on the pelvic floor muscles, and during and after pregnancy these muscles can be strengthened to prevent bladder leakage. Not extremely significant, but noticeable that they included wrong information in the movie.    I don't particularly like Jennifer Lopez so I didn't have high hopes for this movie. It is funny and entertaining if you are just looking for a movie to watch, but don't count on it being great.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|this thing is amazing when im in the car&amp;ne music comes on, but if only it had a wider variety of techno music. Then it would be super dope! :D It gets the job done well
B0037QGS0A|3.0|The movie starts out interesting. The drama and tension that is present in the film helps to draw you in. But at the point where Chloe was telling the wife the stories about the affair, it was so obvious that she was lying. I couldn't understand why the wife just took her for her word, without actual proof. What happens after with the wife and Chloe is definitely one of the more interesting parts of the film, although I thought they could have developed this a little more...we don't really understand why it is that Chloe has this obsession with her. Is it a mental problem, or is it just a big lesbian crush? I liked the character of the son, although not the parts where he is cussing at his mother all the time. Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore are great actors and this film did not live up to their potential.     The thing that really ruined this movie was the ending. It was completely stupid and unrealistic. The suspense and sexual tension make this film worth watching, but keep in mind it is definitely cut short because of the ending.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|crashed my HTC evo. application went missing as well from the application list. please fix this somehow...would LOVE to give you guys 5 stars.
B002ZDOXLW|1.0|I have all of Loreena's music and looked forward with bated breath to this new creation. It was, however, quite boring. Just the same old same old. Disappointing to say the least.
B000NIVJEU|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot.  There was nothing wrong with the movie, it was very entertaining just like Narnia.  What was disappointing  to me is there was suppose to be a sequel.  Still waiting, for those of us who liked the movie there  should be a sequel.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I love this game on PC and have been anxiously awaiting an Android release... however, I only get to play for a minute or two before it stops working on my Captivate. I am no longer able to interact with the game, and there is no way to resolve it short of a reset or battery pull. Hopefully an update will fix this...
0156027321|2.0|My review of Life Of Pi is that it was sort of boring and was long for no reason,but it could be appropriate for high school students. The main character Pi Petal was a very confusing young boy who never got to the point of his stories. In the book he goes on and on about the same topics which made the book boring and seem so long. He also would jump subject to subject which threw me off a couple times because I wasn't sure what he was talking about at that point in the book. However, this book for high school students is somewhat appropriate because he does introduce different writing styles, and also Pi the main character is a 16 year old boy, so its around thier age group and they could identify certain adventures with him. Overall, it was not a great book to me, but if i were a high school student i could have related more to Life Of Pi.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Click on app to open it and all I get is a black screen with an hourglass then it boots me to my DROID X home screen. Happens on my hubbys HTC Incredible too.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Loved this on the PC and happy it has come to Android.  Was concerned it wouldn't run on my Acer Iconia Tab but am pleased to say that game play is smooth.  Cut scenes between rounds are choppy but that's a minor quibble.  Game would not, however, install to my Droid (1).  Not a big deal tho since it is compatible with the tablet.  psyched to see this as the free app but I would have gladly paid the $3 for it!  Fun!
B0042816YK|5.0|Inspiring!!    Julia Roberts plays the role of a heartbroken divorced women who decides to travel to Italy, India, and Indonesia to find inner peace and balance. She goes on a 1 year journey traveling to these 3 countries searching for happiness.     I was inspired by the quote given by Ketut: \\"In order to stay happy, you must always know where you are\\". If you do know your place in the journey of life, you will accept everything that happens to you and will have inner peace, eventually becoming happy. I believe this could simply be done by grabbing a piece of paper and write/draw on it your journey through life. Put on it life's basic elements such as success, love, family, spirituality, health...etc. See where you are. See the big picture. See which areas you need to improve and perfect. Hang this paper somewhere in the house and look at it everyday. Keep thinking about it, and I believe this is how you could achieve inner peace and balance.     I heard people criticize this movie for being slow and sometimes boring. Well, the pace of the movie MUST be slow since its about achieving inner balance. You can't expect a fast paced movie about inner balance to be effective and received well. It has to be slow and need to take its time, just like the journey for the quest of happiness.    Good movie, I highly recommend it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have been playing this game on my computer for years and I love it. If you are thinking of downloading this as the free app of the day, do it!!!!!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book made me want to read more from this writer. Found it mind blowing on how the wrote from inside the mind of a child so well.
0756404738|4.0|**Possible minor spoilers** Count me among the many who absolutely loved The Name of the Wind and grabbed book 2 with tremendous excitement.  And I loved this next chapter in the story as well, but in a lot of ways it really just didn't live up to the first.    A lot of people have expressed problems with the nature of Kvothe's character development from nuanced hero into do-everything Casanova.  I get that, but I still think that the interludes in the story back to present day (same style as book 1) served to counterbalance a lot of that.  Kvothe is (or at least becomes) a very deep and nuanced character clearly, and to me, reading about the dizzying heights of fame and skill that he is gaining here mid-story just intrigues me that much more as to what is to come.    What bothered me the most was the pacing and transition of the book.  It just felt disjointed and jarring at some points.  A long and apparently eventful sea journey glossed over in -- literally -- a page or two.  An almost awkward two page move from a group of mercenaries trudging through the forest to the wild sex party portion of the tale.  And then multiple chapters dedicated to the beauty of a board game.  The unevenness just didn't always work for me and was a departure from a lot of what made the first book so great.    I don't mean to say that I didn't like the book.  It was still a great read and I'll be in line opening day to grab his next book.  Rothfuss set the bar VERY high with his first book, though, and this one just falls short in some ways.
0425242099|5.0|An absolutely wonderful read!      Waiting for Sienna to grow up so we could hear her story was hard - although we have met and enjoyed some wonderful stories/matings along the way.  I am sorry anyone felt the book dragged; I totally disagree.  Ms. Singh has built a world and building a world requires a continual \\"fleshing out\\" to maintain continuity.  Every component that she added kept us informed and up to date on other characters we have grown to love.     My only complaint was that it ended and that I now have to wait for the Ms. Singh's next release.
B004G6009U|5.0|This is a fantastic movie for all ages. I've watched it more times than I would like to admit and love it just as much the *th time as the 1st. The characters are well-developed and interesting. A must-see.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works perfectly on my Nexus One.  The animation after finishing a level is a little slow and jerky, but other than this game is awesome and very addicting.  Get this game.... you won't be disappointed.
B00415EYJ8|5.0|i have always been a big cure fan. more specifically, a fan of their early years (pre \\"kiss me kiss me kiss me\\"). meaning, i like the depressing, angst ridden, punkier cure. all of these songs are from that era. this collection is all of the songs that were included on the \\"cassette\\" version of \\"standing on a beach\\" (later released as \\"staring at the sea\\" on compact disc). the problem with the cd version, is that the b-sides were not included in the collection. now these songs are available again, and on cd. if you are new to the cure, then you need to hear this crucial part of their history.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works perfect on my LG Vortex. Sun seems to come faster than PC game. I love it and recommend it.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Great game. I think everyone knew what to expect and dev delivered. Size is a little large but I can live with it for a solid game. Please update to remember volume settings on exit, 5 stars when volume setting fixed.
B004U52VPS|5.0|I Love , love , love Angry Birds Anything!!! My 5 yr old daughter & I played with it for hours. I was sooo excited when I saw that there was even a real game. I have Angry Birds on my cell phone as well as my laptop. Now I have a tangible game that I can put my hands on too. It takes some getting use to but I love the challenge of it. Next, I'm going to buy all of the plush birds and piggies too...I don't think that the guys at Rovio knew that it would be such a success. Thanx to all, now I've gotta get back to my game...
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I played this game a lot on the PC, I think I even unlocked everything, and so far I'm enjoying this game as much as I did back then except on my galaxy tab! Thanks PopCap! Now how about some Peggle?!?! :)
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Really great game if you like tower defense, runs pretty smoothly although the graphics are not impressive.<br />Locks up and requires a force close to exit when it does so, which is like once every five minutes. Popcap's signature polish is not evident, nor was it evident in the OS X port of this same game. I guess they only know Windows.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|doesnt download on htc my touch slide 3g. i dont know why. Has anyone else had this problem? Its not on the list of phones that does not work
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I bought this item for the top gear sport pet stroller as it didn't come equipped with a cup holder, I saw this for less the ten bucks and decided to give it a try based on reviews and I am really glad I did, it works great and it doesn't get in the way when I fold the stroller up so I am able to just leave it attached. The dual cup holders allow me to carry a beverage for myself and a bottle of water for the pooch as well when we go on those hot long walks. The extra compartments are an added bonus with enough room for cell phone, keys, toys etc.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I've tried to open the app multiple times and it won't play. I'm just glad I didn't pay $2.99 for this POS.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I really thought this game would SUCK on a small screen but guess what not only is it flawless looking the game play is outright AMAZING!
B002SSUQFG|4.0|This is my first mechanical watch, and so far I absolutely love it.  I was concerned at first about its size, as I have a very small wrist and didn't want something bulky.  When it finally arrived, I found it to be an absolutely perfect fit-- not over-sized at all.  The mechanism seems to be keeping very accurate time so far, and it was very easy to set.  The band is a little rough but is easily replaced if you are so inclined.  Overall, great watch for the money if you are looking for something streamlined and unique.
B004VPAXHU|4.0|I had downloaded \\"Running Up That Hill\\" in college almost 10 years ago and loved it, but lost it to some failed hard drive years ago.  Upon hearing the cover version in an ad recently, it got me thinking, \\"What WAS that song???\\"  Eventually, I found Hounds of Love and was basically forced to pre-order this supposedly better new-for-2011 \\"remaster\\" (which apparently already had a great remaster in the late '90s).  In the meantime, I illegally downloaded a version of unknown vintage: 12 MP3 tracks wrapped in a zip.  Over the past few weeks, I have become attached to the nuances of that version.  So, basically what I had been anticipating in this new release was something along the lines of the MP3s but without the slightly muddy compression.  The disc arrived today.  I popped it in my near-audiophile level stereo and was shocked by the subtle muddiness of tracks 1-5.  It was so palpable that I did a quick check to see if I had messed with the equalizer.  Equalizer was off.  I was set for digital input, 2 channels, no effects.  Track 6 and onward are crystal clear compared to the first five.  All I can figure is that perhaps the original tape required some noise cancellation, but honestly I would rather have a bit of hiss if it means getting closer to those angelic vocals.  Perhaps it's all in the ear of the beholder, but I am curious as to whether other purchasers of the 2011 release notice the same issue.    Update:  I take back most of what I said about the muddiness.  I ripped it to uncompressed wave files and am currently listening to \\"Cloudbusting\\" via iPod and OEM earbuds.  It sounds exquisite!!  But still not as crystal clear as the second half of the album.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|My only complaint is that I can't create a shortcut and have to launch the game from the Amazon market app.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I've been waiting for this since I switched from an iphone to my Droid. Looks and plays exactly as I remember. No stuttering on my Optimus S, which isn't the beefiest phone for games.  Unrelated: I'm not sure why a developer would want their app free for a day, the amount of 1 star, rating killing reviews is always amazing to see. People are even rating this poorly so they can complain about Amazon. Some people really are stupid.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|The apologize installed fine over wifi however when it is started up on my device the app is squeezed into the left half of the screen. since it is squeezed into glad the screen you can not select buttons correctly.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Exactly the same as the pc game. Graphics are poor quality but the gameplay is still fun. glad I could get it for free. works fine on the Thunderbolt
0425242099|5.0|I've waited a long time for Hawk's story.  I found it well worth the wait.  Hawk and Sienna's relationship progressed at just the right pace.  I really enjoyed Walker and Laura's story as well. The book was jammed packed with action and a really good read.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Finally, I have waiting for this game since I got my first android phone.  Works great on the HTC thunderbolt.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|why can't I just rate the game? It's a great game but doesn't need a 20th word review... just stars.
0307887960|3.0|I did the diet for the 3 days then tried adding the vegetables with the protein.  This diet is so hard to follow if you miss your fruits.  I did loose the 5 lbs in the 5 days, but it came right back the next week.  This is not a diet that I can continue with.  Just as an aside...forget making the oat bran pancake.  Just eat 1/2 a portion with the splenda and it tastes good and more filling than the pancake.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I picked this up on the day it was released.  Though not tablet optimized, it still looks and plays great on the A500.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|As a fan of Dream Theater,I had sort of stopped listening to their work after the first live album (Once In A Livetime) for no particular reason other than my paying more attention to my previous prog rock favorites like Yes or Kansas. However,since hearing the title track from this DT cd on Youtube,I have discoverd them all over again and can't believe what I've been missing. As for the Octavarium cd,I find it to be the perfect mix of music for first time fans of this group of incredibly talented musicians.  Four thunderous metalic songs(Root of all Evil,These Walls,Panic Attack,and Never Enough) are set off by the more radio friendly  I walk Beside You,and the soft ballad Don't Let It End. The cd concludes with two huge epics,the 9-11 inspired Sacrificed Sons,and the mind blowing title track,Octavarium. With this piece,(it's hard to call it just a song!),DT showcase their 70's prog influences with stunning effect while maintaining complete originality in the composition. From start to finish this epic song takes you on an emotional journey you won't soon recover from,and if you are like me,you'll want to immediately  replay this 24 minute masterpiece. I  highly recommend this cd,and also recommend you get every thing else released by Dream Theater since Metropolis II Scenes From A Memory. What a phenomenal band!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this game... but I'll try.  It hits that mark of elegant design that doesn't need over the top complexity and retina drenching interface to engage the player.  I only took a break to write this quick review because someone wrestled the game away from me to play it themselves. :-)
0060765488|4.0|My wife and I started reading to my daughter when she was still a baby, and have made that a common practice throughout each of her first five years. This is the first \\"real book\\" -- i.e., a book that couldn't be read easily in one sitting -- that my daughter and I have shared. It was a really great first.<br /><br />I never read The Chronicles of Narnia as a child, nor had them read to me. While the first few chapters held my daughter's attention, I wasn't exactly impressed. I thought the writing was a bit clumsy, a little too heavy on 1940s British vernacular. I also thought the characters -- the children at this point -- were poorly developed. However, once the kids are in Narnia \\"for good,\\" the entire tone of the book changes, as does the writing quality. Particularly, the scenes near the end are very well-written, exciting, and evoke a lot of emotion. My daughter would always want two chapters before bedtime, and as the book drew to a close, I'd want to read her a third or fourth!<br /><br />We are now reading Prince Caspian, which I'm told is really the second book in the series (although the books have been reordered after the fact, so that even The Lion, The Witch and, the Wardrobe is no longer Book 1), and we plan to go through the whole series. Many people consider the Chronicles series to be some of the greatest books ever written -- adults, I'm talking about. I don't think I agree with that at all, as I don't think I'd really care to read them on my own. However, as an experience to share with my daughter, the books are excellent: Good enough, rich enough with symbolism to keep my attention and interest, and magical enough to keep her excited and wanting to read.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|I've been following this game for some time, eagerly updating when they added new recipes and even recommending some myself. It is a brilliant implementation; requiring the user to engage in creativity and intuition to figure out increasingly complex combinations/recipes. Instead of relying on obscurity or dexterity like so many games, it makes you tap your imagination.<br /><br />Works great on tablet and phone formats.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great game. it is just as good as the pc version. great free app of the day. only downside is the big file
B00445JSX2|3.0|Well, first I'm a HUGE DM for many years and have all their releases and love all other live DVDs they put out but I can't really understand what happened here. I'm really disappointed.    The 5.1 sound is HORRIBLE, I simply quit to try to listen and move to the stereo sound which is ok, but also VERY weak. All the electronic stuff was very low, dunno if was really like that on the site or was just a bad mixing (rock mixing) or was really intended to be like that, dunno.    But this together with the bad sound quality made the DVD even worst, since it's a music DVD, so at least the sound must be perfect!    The show is good since DM even when they are in a bad day the shows are fantastic... David's voice wasn't half good as in the last DVD and to get worst the video quality is not the best either, aside is not all that crap that I already read around.    This is a 5 star bootleg, but that quality can't be accepted by a band with the size of DM.    So aside the bad quality, the show is great and have amazing moments like always and will worth it in the end, and you as fan like me will buy it anyway doesn't matter if some not-deaf/blind fans like me telling you the truth.    Buy it without fear, you will like it anyway aside the weak production quality.
0743455967|5.0|King is one of the best writers of our time and knows what hes talking about. I feel lucky to have the chance to read this book. His advice is true, like saying if you want to be a writer you  must write and read every single day and theirs no way around it. great
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I love Plants vs Zombies - I have it on no less than 4 other devices (ipod touch, Mac desktop, PC laptop, and Xbox 360). I love that each edition has its own different ways to play, and they have all endured as fun and playable, even after months of playing. Needless to say, I was psyched when PvZ came out for Android, and even more so to get it free yesterday.  However, since I installed it, I have yet to get the game to open.  Very disappointed. Usually I'd say its a game worth paying for - but this time, I'm glad I didn't.
0062060554|5.0|This is one of those books that you open just to glance at the first page and see whether you will like it only to discover yourself five hours later still glued to the book, desperate to find out what happens next. Writing a novel whose main character and narrator suffers from amnesia and doesn't remember most of her life when she wakes up in the morning carries a risk of creating a book that is repetitive. S. J. Watson, however, made Before I Go to Sleep so fascinating, full of surprises, mysteries and revelations that there isn't a single boring page in the entire novel.<br /><br />Christine, the main character of Before I Go to Sleep, wakes up one morning only to realize that she recognizes neither the man who sleeps next to her nor the house she is in. Even her body is alien to her because her most recent memory is that of being a twenty-year-old student and now she is a woman in her forties. Christine discovers that she lost her memory many years ago and now has to find out who she is anew every single morning of her life. When she finds a diary she has been keeping to remind herself of what she has been doing every day, Christine begins a complex and painful journey to self-discovery.<br /><br />Before I Go to Sleep is not only a fascinating suspense thriller. It also makes you think about what constitutes the nature of human identity. What makes our personalities? What are we without our memories? How does one go about reconstructing a life that has been shattered by a horrible tragedy that has robbed you of everything you cherished and lived for?<br /><br />The novel is so professionally structured and so meticulously plotted that I was really surprised to find out that Before I Go to Sleep is S.J. Watson's debut novel. I am extremely glad that I discovered this promising new writer through the Amazon Vine program and will now be eagerly awaiting new books from him. If you like psychological suspense novels, make sure you get this book. It is masterfully written and very believable. I visited the author's website and learned that movie rights to the book have been acquired and the filming will start this year. That is one movie I will definitely be watching.e.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1WN2871ASNJK2]](I am running this game on my HTC Thunderbolt - Model ADR6400L - Droid o/s 2.2.1)    I've gone through Plants Vs. Zombies on the pc and was excited to hear that it was available today for droids!    I just upgraded my phone two days ago from an old flip phone and one of the first things I searched for in the app store was this game. Sad to see it was not out a few days ago but extremely glad to see Amazon offering it and (after learning about the new Amazon app store) installed it as soon as I could.    Now, about the game on my thunderbolt - When loading it, the initial screen where it lays out the grass for \\"Loading\\" did take a small bit, but after that it ran a lot more smoothly than I was expecting. Graphics are nice and it's great to be able to pick this up and play a level on the go. I look forward to getting all of the achievements and I'm sure I'll have to wrestle the phone out of others hands once I show it to them. I can't recommend this enough to everyone. Enjoy the game and protect your lawn, there's a Zombie on it!    (I recorded the video in low quality for bandwidth purposes, the video is just to show you how responsive this droid version is.)
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I downloaded this yesterday, and I can't stop playing. I think I may be addicted. But it's totally worth it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have the EVO and it works great! This is a lot of fun. i love that you can have different profiles. Fun sound effects.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|been waiting forever for this, great game. could use a high resolution, on my epic its not as crisp as on the iphones smaller screen.
0817439390|5.0|I believe this book has won the heart and mind of million of photographers of all levels.  This is probably the best book on the subject of photographic exposure.  Bryan Peterson really has a unique way of using words.  Sometime I think he has missed an opportunity to be a great writer.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|The first time I started it up it worked fine, but now it will not go past the page with the hourglass on it. After that the app just crashes. Power cycled my Droid 2 twice still nada. This app needs an update.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Just like the PC version. I'm so excited to finally have this game on my Android! Runs well on my EVO.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Please. Great game, but losing my stuff every 5 minutes gets annoying. 5 star when fixed. Fill in words to get to 20
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Darn it...freezes up then my Samsung Captivate was locked up. Had to remove battery from my phone to clear you the issue.
B004SBQAN8|1.0|The story itself is good, but the acting and directing are all mediocre. One example is that there is no emotional buildup whatsoever and all of a sudden the dude and the girl are madly in love and cannot live without each other. What?    This whole film is plain awkward. What a waste of time.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|i deleted everything. I freed up 100mb of space on my phone's cache, and it's still saying that there is not enough space to install this app.
B004M66YSA|5.0|because I dont like any of their other albums, except this one! Everything came together on the cd...its the band most produced collection of songs (thanks to Flood and Alan Moulder, those guys arent cheap and the cd is worth every cent they cahrged!!!), the songwriting on this release is strong and consistent in its melody making; top notch stuff. More guitars than on their other releases on this cd (flood). If the next cd is just half as good as this one, ill have to consider myself a fan...<br /><br />oh yeah, if you never heard of this bad they sound like blah, blah and blah; with similarities to blah (see the other reviews), what I can tell you that everyone agrees is that borrow heavily from 80's pop, but are creative enough to add their own flavor to the stew.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|The game is fun, when it is running.  Sadly, no support for the original Motorola DROID.  Other, more complicated, games run just fine on it.  Was able to run it on my Viewsonic gTablet, but game would freeze after a couple levels.
0756405890|5.0|This is one of the finest fantasy tales in decades.  You would have to go to the levels of Tad Williams to get the combination of character development and strong writing.   Absent the banal dialoge the held up the Jordan pith. (I know, bazillions of readers disagree, but this is my review). I read this first book when it came and and the sequel took so long to get to market I had to re-read it again - which is my only negative.    This book will also appeal to historical fiction types as the amount of \\"magic\\" and \\"fantasy\\" involved is at a minimum, however, I expect that to change as the series develops.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|Rather than basing this version of Robin Hood on any of the ancient legends about this fictional character, the film makers of this excellent, well acted, and dramatic movie base their totally different version in small part upon actual history. Robin is not the fine, nice, gentleman portrayed in the other films, but a low class expert archer who is a crook with a conscious, who accompanies King Richard on his crusade to Palestine and participates somewhat reluctantly in the king's robberies and slaughters both in Palestine and on his return trip to England when the king and his rag tag army destroy cities, murder people, rob them, and rape women. When the king and one of his principle knights are killed, Robin disguises himself as the king's knight and returns to England hoping to use the disguise to accumulate wealth. However, he discovers that the knight has a wife, Marian, and he comes in conflict with the heavy-handed murdering King John, who succeeds his brother Richard, and who, like Richard, has his men kill and plunder fellow English people. Robin and John also have to face King Phillip of France who is attacking England with the same despicable goals in mind.<br /><br /> Other than the character of John, the depiction of the time, and the attack by the French, this is all fiction. But the movie portrays the reactions of the Barons to King John's acts and their insistence that he sign a document that diminishes his arbitrary authority, his ability to kill and plunder at will, that at least the freemen, but not serfs, cannot be punished except by law. John agrees to it, but then reneges. This is where the film ends.<br /><br /> However, the Barons were able to force John to sign the document later - which came to be called the Magna Carta, the Great Charter - in 1215. John dies in 1216. The Magna Carta is modified somewhat in 1297 and becomes, many English people feel, the basic constitution of the land.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|I paid for this?  what a ripoff!   shame on all those glowing reviewers .  were they all planted?  i think so  .
B004SBQALA|5.0|A surprise hit!!! My entire family enjoyed it, despite mostly all 4 of us were uninterested when we rented it!!! Pleasantly surprising how much we loved the characters despite the high schooler vibe, overused and overplayed like in most PG13 movies, this movie had a deeper spin on it . Bought this blu-ray through amazon, it works great and the shipping was super fast! Great movie, highly recommend!!!
0736092269|5.0|With over 450,000 copies sold, this book is arguably the best book of its kind. What's it useful for? Mainly to help the reader (from the weekend athlete to the athletic trainer to the professional bodybuilder) figure out what exercises work what muscles.<br /><br />It's neatly divided up into sections (arms, shoulders, chest, back, etc.), so all you really have to do is flip to one of these sections and it will have detailed pictures of various exercises and exactly which muscles are involved.<br /><br />A great reference to keep have around, I give it five stars easy. Readers who lift weights regularly might also be interested in [[ASIN:1457527243 Bulletproof Your Shoulder]] to avoid shoulder problems a lot of lifters eventually get.
B003UYUP58|5.0|I have worked in cancer research, I'm a bit of a science geek, I have also worked with vaccine production and have a husband a 10year + survivor of ALL and I take an interest in History, so this book ticked all the boxes for me. I loved the history, the examples of how far we have come in our discoveries and treatments but yet it is still a realistic book. Cancer will probably always be with us in some form. We have survived so well as a species due to survival of the fitess, mutations and change, Cancer as a disease is also surviving due to its ability to mutate and change. A book for everyone because it is a subject that touches everyone the science bits are well written I'm not sure how easy for people without a real science backround to follow but a must for any science geek.
B00136Q79I|4.0|I have to admit, after listening to this album a few times, it grew on me.  At first I wasn't too fond of Tom Araya's singing, as it can be hard to understand what he's saying at times.  But the flow of the songs and the attitude behind them hits you with pure adrenaline rush.  Disclaimer: Unlike a lot of you hardcore Slayer fans, I don't condone evil, death and certainly  don't extoll the deranged Nazi scientist, Joseph Mengele.  That said, just listening to the song Angel of Death passively and not paying attention to the dark lyrics, it's a very catchy song.  I also like postmortem (the part where Araya screams always gives me a goosebump!).  All in all, a great album.  A bit overrated?  Perhaps.  But this is all subject to debate, right?  Quality and content wise, Reign falls short of THE definitive speed metal album and arguably one of rock's all time great albums, the legendary Master of Puppets.  Suffice it to say, it's in a class all its own.  Lyrically and musically, MOP is a superior album.  End of debate.
0977326403|5.0|This is a great supplement to the book Good to Great.  It is the \\"last chapter\\" of that book.  This monograph takes the Good to Great principles and applies them to non-profits and schools.  It is a great book to show the application of the principles and that the information in Good To Great has legs and can transfer to other areas.  I would not read this first or as a stand alone.  One really needs to read Good to Great first, then this mongraph.  This book is a wonderful way to wrap-up the concepts and to really start to think of them and apply them.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Pretty addicting little game! I have a Droid X and it works fine on my phone...only thing I've noticed is it self pauses when you get notices, etc on ur phone...which I donn't mind since I'd rather not get eaten by Zombies!  Glad I downloaded for free yesterday!
0061537969|1.0|I love dog books, and I really was interested in this one because it was from the perspective of a dog. so I picked the CD up from the library. The characters were under developed, and Enzo the dog sounded like a fraternity guy in a college dorm trying to sound intellectual rather than a philosophizing dog. And I didn't buy the idea that he is a philosopher by watching a lot of television. Do children who watch too much TV start philosophizing? No! And the author tried to make it good by very slowly killing the main character's wife, but he missed the fact that we need to get to know and love the characters before we actually care about one of them dying. It was so slow that I kept on saying to the book on CD \\"JUST DIE ALREADY! QUIT DRAWING IT OUT!\\" It was so painfully bad, that I didn't even finish listening to the book. I kept waiting for it to get good but it was so dumb I could cry. On top of that, I hated the cursings - I had a 2 1/2 year old daughter listening too! Maybe one or two bad words are ok, but it was ridiculous how many sursings and sexual comments and references were in this book. It was a piece of junk. \\"Marley and Me\\" is an awesome book, not this one. Have a camp fire and roast this piece of pitiful trash of a book.
B004SKIPXW|5.0|This movie was AWESOME!!! If you like terratino movies you will like this.. In 3D this movie was a blast.. I can see alot of people not liking this movie, This is just like a Quintin movie in the fact the way it was shot, the motions of the camara, This is the way the movie was ment to be if anyone reads the back of the dvd case, so if you dont like terratino movies, dont get this and give it a 1, thats a waist!!! Im not pointing out the bad points that i didnt like, because people are so differnt, and will like the points i dont, but there is one spot in this movie i loved, i thought it was funny because this is a MOVIE,,, ENTERTAINMENT if anyone can understand what that is!!!!   Tell you the one spot,,,, Millton goes to a hotel room with this girl, they start to whooom whoooom,, LOL, While they are \\"\\"whoommen\\"\\" Guys come to Kill Millton, and he starts shooting the people WHILE he is \\"\\"Whooom whooomin\\"\\", What a kick i got out of that in 3D it was really good!! so if anyone likes quintin movies GET THIS BLAST!!!
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I am a 35 year old woman who recently purchased a [[ASIN:B002I08UWU Nintendo DSi XL Burgundy]]. I have spent a lot of time reading reviews of different games here on Amazon to try and find several I would enjoy.<br /><br />I am so glad I found this game. The only people I would not recommend this game to are those who don't enjoy reading. This game involves lots of (very compelling and engrossing) reading. This title is rated M, and is intended for adults only. Themes are violent and may be disturbing if you are offended by profanity and adult themed and / or violent content.<br /><br />If those are non issues for you, buy this game! There are multiple endings to discover. I've completed four, and every time I was left stunned and surprised by the outcome. I like this so well, I will probably play through all of the scenarios. Although you must repeat the puzzle / mission segments each time again, you can quickly skip through dialogue you've encountered before.<br /><br />The resale value for this game is excellent. When you are finished with it, you can get most of your money back. A nice little bonus. I hope to see more games from this developer in the future. I would buy on the release date for sure.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|No problems at all! Great game. Installed it to my SD card and started playing. Stock Droid X. However, I have an unlimited plan, I should be able to download over 3G. Just sayin...
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great great game. Love it. I'm addicted to it already. Don't complain about the long load. After all the game is free. If you don't like it go to the ios and pay for every single app that amazon has given out for free.<br />Thanks again amazon!
B000F8O35U|5.0|all my little grandchildren love this movie it was well worth the price which was a value to boot.  I would definitely recommend this movie for old and young as it is very entertaining and the music is fabulous!
B000TGCR38|5.0|The story of an attractive Jewish woman in the 1940s in Holland, who joins a resistance to save the lives of other Jews. Before her introduction to the resistance, she nearly gets murdered along with about 20-30 other Jews on a boat that was supposed to take them away to a safe location; her parents were among the murdered. After that incident she dyes her hair blond and seduces a Nazi officer, a Captain. Before she realizes it she is in deep and the heads of the resistance want her to find out as much as she can, so she spies on the Nazis and what their plans are. Little does she know that some of the main guys in the resistance are working with the Nazis to round up rich Jews, kill them and split the money among themselves. Watch this for a great story and she has great pair too.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Game was free yesterday and I got what I paid for...nothing. Game won't start. And I had to go thru the pain of setting up 1 click to get it.
B003INBNXO|5.0|A semi-biographical account of Yip Man, the first martial arts master to teach the Chinese martial art of Wing Chun.For those who don't know, this is the man that trained Bruce Lee. This is his story, his struggle, the Japanese wanted to conquer that part of the world, China and expand from there. All the man wanted to do was teach martial arts to disciples...he tried to do this with people breathing down his neck at all times and challenging him to fight every 10min lol. I've never seen anything like this
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Love this game, great graphics...game has to reload everytime the screen timeout though. Other than that it's great. Lots of levels in adventure mode
0439796644|5.0|I am absolutely pleased regarding my order from Brookebooks.  I had ordered it from another site several weeks before, and it was frustrating experience.  That order was cancelled by the distributor.  I then ordered two copies of War Horse from Brookebooks and the books were received within days.  I was contacted by them several times--- telling me that my order had been shipped, and then asking me if I was pleased by their service.  Definitely yes.  The two paperbacks arrived in brand new condition as stated.  I am impressed by their courtesy and follow-ups.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is pretty much one of the top 3rd best iphone games in existence. Now it's finally available for android!  Seriously can't rave enough about how great this game is.  I started with the PC version and loved it so much I also got it for my macbooks,  ipad,  ipod touch and today my galaxy s.  Soooooo cool. Best game released for android so far.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Playing on the Evo 4G works great smooth ,....can't put it down. must have for android users. got it for free but its worth every penny.
0143038419|5.0|This book was inspirational to me in so many ways. I will say it dragged at times. There were times where I could not put it down and there were times when I was bored with it. Liz Gilbert elaborates a lot and can be overdramatic, but at the same time her writing it clever, brilliant even and hilarious. There were times I literally laughed out loud. The ending just blew me away. I was so happy for her and now I am so excited to read \\"Committed\\". I was deeply moved by Liz's bravery to go out into the world on her own and face her fears. I have studied Buddhism and Hinduism so I was enthralled by her spiritual persuit and exploration in India (and also Indonesia). I am someone who loves to travel so reading her adventures was deeply enjoyed. Eat, Pray, Love is now like a personal bible or handbook for me which taught me to enjoy life, face my fears, pray relentlessly and open my heart. Thanks Liz. AMAZING read, highly recommended. Haven't seen the movie yet but I am looking forward to it.
B000003MZU|5.0|El mejor CD de Juan Luis Guerra. Las letras son únicas y la música incomparable. Una compra que vale la pena definitivamente.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I've played through PvZ on my PC, and absolutely love it! It's totally addictive. I'm sure it's great on Android... however, it won't run on my Archos Internet 101.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|For those familiar with the game from Xbox or other type platform, this is the exact same thing only made to be played anywhere at anytime! Very fun and entertaining!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Well worth purchasing as this is a movie that you will want to see several times.  This gives real insights into how autistic people think and view the world.  I heard Temple Grandin speak about a month after I saw the movie and she validated what was shown on the film.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great game on EVO 4G. Responsive, stable, but most importantly it's fun! Got it free on App Day but would pay the $2.99 for it anyway.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|One of the best games from the computer is now on mobile and it is better than ever. Great graphics you just touch to pick up and put stuff down. download it while it's free
B0052UZIFA|5.0|quick load and no problems running on droid x. great and addicting game.. dont review it badly because it won't play on your phone.. it says which phones and tablets it doesnt work on.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game runs great on my Thunderbolt.  Absolutly love it!!!    I don't understand why people leave 1 star reviews for a game that doesn't work on their phone when it clearly states in the description that it doesn't support some older devices.    That would be like leaving a horrible review for Diesel just because I drive a gas powered car.
B0000VCZKM|3.0|I received exactly what I ordered - Annie on DVD - the disc was \\"used\\", which definitely shows on the disc itself. Skips only in the menu, so we're able to watch the movie (which is good); other than the skipping, it was a very smoothe transaction :)
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Works great on my Evo but when there are a lot if zombies you can see the lag occuring.  I also have the galaxy tab and sometimes it freezes on me. But the game is addicting so play on!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This might be even better on my G2X than it was on the pc. It's just a great android port.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great job bringing this game to the small screen. I'm addicted to the original and now have it on my phone so I may need to check into rehab.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Very annoyed that it is Wifi only.  I have a 4g phone so I won't need to worry about proximity to wifi but Amazon uses radio type to measure bandwidth rather than actual throughput.  First and likely lat time downloading from Amazon app store at least until they make so improvements.
B00004CXT5|1.0|Come to find out this movie does not play in the USA!!!! I will never by a movie off of Amazon ever again!
B002MQYOFW|1.0|This was not a book.  It was nothing more than a long newspaper article.  Not only was it a surface most brief coverage of the topic, it was suspect in some of its \\"facts\\"  Total rip off!!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I've been looking forward to playing PvZ on Android for a while now, so I was psyched to see it on here at last.  It's a great game and totally worth the money!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great graphics and good times.  No messy pixels or slow downs.  Runs nicely, good tunes, good times.  Its a must get
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This used to be my favorite game on my ipod touch before I sold it. So happy that I can now play it on my phone! The game feels literally exactly the same as it does on the ipod touch. I might have wished for some android specific optimizations but that's ok.     Performance seems fine as far as I can tell on my mytouch 4g running CM7
B0052UZIFA|5.0|excellent game. thank you pop cap for finally joining the android revolution. i can see myself wasting lots of time and battery playing this game.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|The game is a great little casual tower defense game, plays almost exactly like the pc game which i played to death last year. Graphics might be a tad lower resolution than the pc version but that is to be expected with the difference in computing power between the two platforms. Not a single issue on my HTC G2 and i played through about 15 levels in the adverture mode so far.  You know what is annoying? People rating apps poorly because they don't work on their device when it clearly says in the product description that it doesnt work with all devices. Especially when it's a free download that day. It's free people stop complaining!
B000001E7L|5.0|love it, great service
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I am so happy that PvZ is now available for the Android. Because it is graphic intense it takes a while to download, even with a fast Wi-Fi connection, but it is worth it. I downloaded it to my Incredible then moved it to my SD card before opening it. Works perfectly. A very happy customer.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|sad that it is not designed to work on an original droid.   it was only 4 or 5 months ago that the droid was still on the shelf.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|This is by far the best Lady Gaga album ever, even though she's only released 3. I love all of her songs and these are the best. All of the songs are amazing. She's amazing. Okay, it is different, but no good artist stays the same throughout their entire career and Lady Gaga is certainly not one of the artists that does. She changes her style with each new release and manages to do it perfectly. And that's what this album is. Perfection.
B0052OWGYW|4.0|Nothing really spectacular here. Just a well made action movie. About what is to be expected from a hollywood big budget summer action movie. The script is tight, the acting is good and the action is great. It is a good popcorn action movie but really not more than that. You won't be talking about it at the water cooler tomorrow. But you won't be complaining about it either.<br /><br />About the remake<br />This is a very loose remake of an old Charles Bronson movie by the same name. In that original work [[ASIN:B00006FDAP The Mechanic]]  Charles Bronson is an aging hit man who takes on a young protege (Jan Michael Vincent) teaches him the ropes of being a hit man. That movie, while dated, is special.<br /><br />This movie loosely follows that same idea with a lot of modern updates. - more action, less dialogue, bigger explosions.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|i can't get the game to open. is anyone else having that problem? this is so frustrating!i i am going to uninstall it
0891419063|5.0|This book was amazing! The first hand account of a young marine and Peleliu and Okinawa is filled with spectacular detail. This book is the closest thing you get to combat with out being there.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this is the best handheld version thus far. I have it for the iPhone as well and this version is worlds better on the EVO 4&quot; screen!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I fell in love with this game on my xbox 360 and now I'm thrilled to have it in my pocket.  Works great on my Droid X.
B003UESJEM|3.0|This movie is kinda dull but is average overall because its entartaining enough to watch because of its subject matter and execution. 7.5/10
B004QXJZXA|4.0|First, if you're looking at this film then you know what Le Mans is. The cars, the challenge, the drivers. It's all there in this film. The race footage is amazing and the engine sounds are worth listening to (even sans video). While the \\"story\\" does bog down through parts of the film, the race keeps everything going and keeps the movie focused. The blu-ray transfer is very crisp and I have no complaints. If you're wanting any special features, keep wanting. There isn't much in this blu-ray version except a small \\"Making of\\". Other than that, not much except the trailer. Then again, the movie alone is worth it.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|My husband and I were both very disappointed and confused why this is labelled a droid app from the droid appstore and then at the bottom it says that it's NOT compatible with DROIDS????  LAME!!!!  rather a bummer to get all excited about a fun game being free for a day, only to find out that we can't use it :(
B002UPA4ZY|2.0|The video and audio quality is not really good compare to most DVD should be. Feels like cheap production or those bought in pirated store quality.
B004SRNH10|5.0|it opens up a lot of apps for testing, development and entertainment. its solid for all of the features it offers
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Good fun! Runs smooth and very addicting! Did have one issue with a force close, but no big. I have found my timekiller! -HTC thunderbolt
B004XDYJRU|5.0|It works! lol I picked up this app to try and see if I could pick up my rock station, WJJO 94.1 and it comes in clear, better sound quality then Pandora! i will use this every day!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|The game is there - I am by no means saying the game is bad. However, there are white lines around graphic elements and the graphics look a little underrezed and washed out. Not a deal breaker, but a little disappointing for a Class A title release.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|It often fails to even load up it just goes blank then to my home page. It also force closes on me when I do manage to make the game loaded. is this the consequences for getting it for free?
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Works petty well on my droid x. It is alil glitchy at the end of the levels tho.<br /><br />It sucks that it is wifi only download. Amazon can't you make it downloadable apk for pc with transfer to phone through usb.<br /><br />For those complaining about graphics, it is probably like that because of survival endless, if its on here, I haven't gotten through adventure yet so idk. But on other versions it gets ridiculous.<br /><br />Overall, this game is amazing, I have it on xbox and pc and I've been waiting on a droid version for awhile now.<br /><br />Would like to see<br />1) swype for sun, not click<br />2) better sound<br />3) low, mid, high graphics settings<br />w/ forced low on survival endless If needed.<br /><br />Btw, anyone know if we have mini and survival endless on here?
B0052UZIFA|1.0|wish I had picked this up yesterday when it was free.  I bought it today, listed as compatible with both of my tablets.  I get a splash screen with an hourglass, and then it closes back to home screen.  I used taskill to shut all background programs, and it still would not open.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Very different from what Gaga has made in the past but still good in its own way. Feels a little more on the generic side than her last album but I still like it alot especially since she is still provocative and pushing people to understand the world in a broader sense. I love you Gaga!
0140277447|5.0|Until I read the Rape of Nanking, I was familiar with this tragedy only as one of many atrocities by the Japanese during WWII. Now, it takes its place alongside the Nazi's extermination camps as a horror I will never forget.  This book is riveting, horrifying,  fascinating, infuriating -- but it also gives you hope.  A few individuals of Nanjing's international community, led by John Rabe, a German businessman, were able to save thousands of Chinese from certain death at the hands of the Japanese troops.  This is their story as well and you owe it to yourself to learn how some people can be good, and do the right thing, when evil surrounds them and hope seems lost.
B00003CX5P|2.0|I had planned to keep The Phantom Menace from my son for as long as possible, but he's four now and into everything Star Wars, and it was playing on Spike TV this weekend, and...well, he's been exposed. And at the same time, I've been re-exposed, and although I appreciate the visual effects, I can't help but think how unnecessarily complicated it is. Star Wars (that is, the inanely retitled \\"A New Hope\\") was simple without being overly simplistic. It was a fantastic example of good storytelling. It also benefited from Lucas's lack of time and money: He simply couldn't include every little thing he wanted to, so he had to streamline the story--and it all worked for the better. On The Phantom Menace, on the other hand, Lucas was free to indulge himself, with no limits on budget, and no one to say \\"No.\\" End result: a huge, noisy, visually sumptuous mess.<br /><br />I wrote the following shortly after seeing TPM in the theater for the first time. Other than changing \\"Disney\\" to \\"Hanna-Barbera,\\" which is more accurate and reflects my great respect for Disney and my ambivalence toward H-B, it remains unchanged--and relevant.<br /><br />What we have here is a poorly written story, acted out by great actors (Jake Lloyd excepted) with fantastic special effects and a whole mess of stupid (as in unintelligent) aliens. Star Wars was an adult movie, written for adults, that happens to resonate with kids because it encompasses universal desires and themes (getting off the farm, becoming a hero). TPM is a kids' movie; it's a Hanna-Barbera cartoon; it's lowest-common-denominator filmmaking at its most expensive. For some unfathomable reason, Lucas decided that he needed to please every conceivable audience member with this movie (including every kid alive), and he managed to upset quite a few of them. (Jar Jar Binks is just annoying, and completely worthless to the story; Boss Nass, however, is one step removed from Uncle Remus. Heck, you might as well put spears in the hands of the Gungans and put them in blackface. Maybe they'll do it in twenty years for the Special Edition. And don't get me started on the Trade Federasians.)<br /><br />So let's talk logic: How does a little slave boy manage to haul two huge engines and a pod to his backyard, and how did his master not know about it? How did he pay for them? What's the point of having a slave if you just let him go home to Mommy at night? How did two sniveling, cowardly incompetents make it to the top of the supposedly ruthless Trade Federation? (\\"Oh! Jedi coming! Crows de brast doors!\\")<br /><br />Worthy opponents? All the bad guys, except for Palpatine (and Ian McDiarmid brings a lot to the role), are cardboard cutouts. They're all stupid and just plain evil--even Darth Maul, whose sole purpose is to look cool while he's fighting. They could have dumped Maul and let Sidious do the fighting. (Qui-Gon sees under the hood and there's a flash of recognition in QG's eyes as he dies...) In Star Wars, by contrast, everyone was pretty dang smart--notably the bad guys. Luke was naive at first, but he wasn't stupid. And no one was in the movie just to provide comic relief--all the laughs arose naturally from the situations: \\"Listen to them, they're dying, Artoo!\\" (See \\"tension and release.\\")<br /><br />Worse, in TPM, almost everything happens BY ACCIDENT (despite what Qui-Gon Jinn says about there not being any accidents--and no wonder, since their whole universe seems to be one accident after another): Jar Jar accidentally wastes a bunch of droids while kicking one off; Jar Jar accidentally drops exploding balls on the droids, saving his people; Anakin accidentally flies into the droid control ship and accidentally blows up the power generators. This, my friends, is no way to plot a movie. Accidents and coincidences are the plot devices of hack writers.<br /><br />Look, I was the biggest Star Wars fan alive, once. I still love to watch it, and it still gets me \\"right here\\" when I do. [Although nowI will only watch Adywan's \\"Star Wars: A New Hope Revisited.\\"] Star Wars (I can't bring myself to call it \\"A New Hope\\") was a solid piece of filmmaking, one of my top three favorites of all time. TPM looked like my Star Wars and it sounded like my Star Wars, but it lacked the soul of my Star Wars. I couldn't connect. If you can, that's fantastic. In fact, I envy you. Because I just can't look past the glaring faults and huge plot holes and say that it was--in any sense other than being an entertaining diversion for two hours--a good movie.w Hope Revisited.\\"] Star Wars (I can't bring myself to call it \\"A New Hope\\") was a solid piece of filmmaking, one of my top three favorites of all time.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|It doesn't work on my htc evo. It takes forever to download, so it was a complete waste of time.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have been waiting for this game as long as I waited for Angry Birds. And I am not disappointed. This is a great port, and so far retains all the fun and excitement of the original. I have only played a few levels so far, and it already feels very deep (just look at the achievements screen to see what I mean).<br /><br />I have a Moto Droid X 2.2 and it runs just fine.  I realize some people are upset that they cannot play it on their device. I know that is frustrating. But don't give the game a low rating because of that. I would prefer the game is well done and has high standards than it be able to play on every single phone. What if it could play on every phone but had terrible graphics? That would not be a good compromise. So get a new phone, because this will not be the last time this happens. And I don't think the developers should be punished for that. It is a limitation of Android. So deal with it.<br /><br />Now just gotta hang in there for Cut the Rope and all will be right in the universe...
B002TQKS14|5.0|This is one of those books that will annoy your friends -- because you'll keep telling them about parts you remember from it. (Doubly annoying for my friends, because I can never describe the anecdotes as clearly and succinctly as Michael Pollan does.) This, despite the title and cover, is not one of those books designed to scare you from eating meat. It's a fascinating look at the big food industry, and smaller alternatives. I won't try to confuse the issues here, suffice it to say that there are fantastic descriptions of what \\"organic\\" food really means in today's world, the crazy way the industrial food machine has evolved to keep itself going, and intriguing looks at some back-to-basics approaches. There is even a very well thought out internal debate from the author as he tries to decide whether or not to go vegetarian.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Ok, so when I play the game I can play well on my galaxy tab7 but it sometimes forcecloses and locks up. When it works its fine but it is sometimes crappy and laggy, but only at the end of the game. Wifi only..ok but should be a little less than 79 meggs! And for all of the laggs,plz fix!
030746363X|5.0|I have only gone through the four hour body fat loss part of the book, however its working for me.
B00003CXA6|5.0|The movie is well done. It does a great job of showing how men from all walks of life fought for their belief. Also, brings out how men from both sides were friends, brothers, etc. It made me feel the anguish.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I am playing on a Droid X2, and the gameplay is addictive. However i am about ready to hang it up until the next update. My issue is that in the middle of gameplay, as it gets very busy - it pauses. Then i have to hit 'unpause' and continue. This is not a major bug, but it really disrupts gameplay and can happen several times in a given level.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This game makes my eyes bleed on my Galaxy Tab 10.1&quot;. This is a horrible port worthy of less than one star.
0425242099|3.0|I love this series and have been waiting a long time for Hawke and Sienna's story. The first 3/4's of the book dragged a bit for me, despite being full of character's I love. The angst regarding Hawke's \\"true love and mate, Rissa\\" also had me fed up to the point where I felt like Sienna was getting a raw deal. I agree with the other reviewer who thought Kit was dispossed of a little too neatly. The action and true romance for me did not kick in until the last 1/4 of the book. There was a filler romance between Walker and Lara did not particularly hold my interest, but at the time there was not a lot of progress between H&S, so it was okay. We see quite a bit of Judd and the Ghost, which I always enjoy. Definately read it! Lord knows we've waited long enough, but I would approach it with more mid-level expctations than I had.
B004LZRSBY|5.0|As a child of the 80's this is a great DVD. I was a fan when \\"Take on Me\\" came out. They made one of the best music videos of all time. However I never got the opportunitly to see them live. So the DVD will have to do. What a great Blu-Ray DVD. Amazing video and audio quality. It really makes your HD TV and Blu-Ray player shine. Its just about the best DVD as far as quality that I own. If you are a child of the 80's I don't think you will be disappointed if you purchase it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this one of the most addictive games i have played in a long time.  its worth the money.  it's basically a tower defense game
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Love the game.  Doesn't get too hard (yet) and it keeps a silly vibe throughout gameplay.  You have to think about what you are going to do, but it isn't like you have to really concentrate. Sometimes the game can slow down during a zombie rampage and 1,000 things are happening on the screen, but it doesn't bother me.  Good stuff, well worth the 2.99
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Runs well on rooted B&amp;N Nook Color, slow enitial load up but after first boot runs quite well.  Just waiting for some over all optimizations and better graphics that scale for a 7&quot; screen.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|It goes straight to sd automatically shrinking the large file. It plays smooth and over all game exceeded my expectations, I had never played the pc version. Evo 4g.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Runs great on my droid x. Fun stuff! Cant stop playing it and I played it for about 3 hrs straight. lol :-)
B003UESJHO|5.0|The Fighter is quite a good film. The themes of family, courage, pride and rising to a challenge are well explored here and because these themes are so universal it makes a great story--one that is based on real life, too! Of course, this isn't the first film to examine these issues; but The Fighter does it all with panache. While the acting by the entire cast is superlative, Christian Bale steals practically every scene he's in as he portrays Dicky Eklund, a local boxing legend living in Lowell, Massachusetts. In addition, the choreography couldn't have been any better; and the cinematography left nothing to be desired.<br /><br />When the action starts, we quickly meet Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg), a mostly unsuccessful boxer being managed by his mother Alice Ward (Melissa Leo) and trained by both his unreliable, drug addicted half-brother Dicky (Christian Bale)and Mickey O'Keefe, a police sergeant in the Lowell police department.  Although Alice, Dicky and Mickey have nothing but the best of intentions as far as Micky's career is concerned, Micky is seen in the boxing world as nothing but a \\"stepping stone,\\" a boxer other people fight and almost always beat as they climb their way up the ladder. Micky yearns for a more successful career in professional boxing; and Mark Wahlberg's acting is so fine that I really felt for Micky.<br /><br />Things become more complicated when Micky's life starts to change: he meets a gutsy young woman named Charlene (Amy Adams) who, although she is herself a college dropout, has spirit, a sharp mind and true belief in Micky's ability to go further in the world of boxing. She encourages Micky to take an offer to train year-round in Las Vegas; this causes a major upheaval in the family as Alice and Dicky are shocked and hurt by the realization that Micky just might go to Vegas to train for real--and this would mean they failed to help one of their own become successful. Things get even worse when Dicky is arrested and Micky's hand is badly hurt by the police when he is also arrested for trying to interfere with Dicky's arrest.<br /><br />There are some very good plot twists and turns that I won't mention for fear of spoiling it for you; suffice it to say that the characters in this film experience quite a bit of action and soul searching along the way. Look for an excellent performance by Mickey O'Keefe as himself, a police sergeant in Lowell, Massachusetts who also trained Micky along the way; and Jack McGee does a wonderful job of playing Alice's husband George. Frank Renzulli plays Sal Lanano and Sugar Ray Leonard has a cameo in the film. There's also an interesting subplot about the making of a film about Dicky.<br /><br />The DVD comes with an optional running commentary and there is a \\"making of\\" featurette that I particularly enjoyed.<br /><br />Overall, The Fighter is a very good movie that I would recommend for anyone interested in gritty dramas based on real life events with action and suspense--as well as family issues being played out. Fans of the actors in this film will also want this for their collections.police when he is also arrested for trying to interfere with Dicky's arrest.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|I am a thirteen year old girl, and I thought that this book was okay. Katniss is really a strong character. It is easy to see throughout the entire novel what see wants-to protect Prim, her little sister. This is what drives Katniss's actions throughout the entire series. See is entered into the Hunger Games because of her urge to protect Prim from harm. I was disappointed in Peeta's character, however. I found it hard to see his motives in the Games. He was unreadable, which doesn't correspond with his character, who seems to Katniss to be open to her. The plot was good, though I found it a bit gruesome. Overall, this book was fine.
1934030554|5.0|This book is awesome!  It divulges many ways that you can use the power meter to help your training.  It heavily revolves around using the Training Peaks WKO+ software, so be prepared to buy it too.  It doesn't keep secrets.  It could be used by coaches or technically savvy people who would like to self coach.  If you're not a numbers person, it may go a bit too far.  At the moment, even though it is on it's second edition, it still has no rivals.  I would like to see more books written about power training.  Right now it has the market cornered.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works great on my droid x! Such a fun game. Long download time and requires wifi but game itself is awesome!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|The game is great. Super fun. I've played it dozens of times on various ipads. However, when it comes to playing it on my phone, that's another story.    All is well initially but as the levels increase and become more complex the game begins to lag. Also after 10-15 min of play my phone becomes red hot and completely shuts down. Then the phone goes through this cycle of restarting then shutting down 2-3 times. Quite frustrating. They need to make this game more compatible to the Android system.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|ive been waiting for this game to be ported into android and it did not disappoint. Ive other versions of this game on pc and the 360 and now i can finally take it on the go.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|New levels are not fun. Now, the monkeys are able to balance in mid air when there is CLEARLY absolutely nothing there holding them. These levels are practically impossible to beat. Suks,
B0000CABBW|3.0|The movie IS good. Castle-Hughes did do a good job. I simply didn't realize that the \\"whale riding\\" only happened in the last 15 minutes. I spent the whole movie going \\"Ok, speed this up,,,talking talking talking.....we GET it, he's upset she's a girl!!\\"    The scene where Paikea cries on stage because the grandfather isn't there to see her is very sad though.     I wonder why it wasn't set a hundred years ago or so though. Too bad the \\"island people\\" weren't in more ethnic looking garb (sorry, I loved Apocolypto for that reason) and so many of the actors having british rather than \\"polynesian\\" accents kind of threw off the authenticity too. For me anyway.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|well I'm enjoying it one my mytouch 4G and its pretty awesome. as long as you have a 600mhz and above processor you should be good.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|PvZ has been one of my family's favorite games across a number of devices and platforms (iPod Touch, Windows laptop, Nintendo DSi), so we were looking forward to the Android version. While the new version has the same great gameplay, it's clear that this version was rushed and needs more work to get it as polished as the iOS and Windows versions.    1. The loading time is MUCH longer on our two Android devices (HTC Incredible and Motorola Xoom) than on an old iPod Touch. Also, the loading animation stutters and is choppy.    2. The onscreen fonts in some places seem just a little off and crude.    3. The end of level animations are MUCH slower and choppier than in other versions.    4. The game is clearly not optimized for tablets and Honeycomb. The graphics are jagged and there are clear gaps and seams in the graphics on some screens. Also, the game doesn't take advantage of the increased resolution of the Xoom.    So, overall, it's great to have PvZ on the Android platform. The gameplay is still as fun and addictive as ever. However, the game itself needs polish and seems unfinished in spots. It also needs to be optimized for Honeycomb to take advantage of Android tablets.    I'm hoping that PopCap will put in a little more work to polish the app and push out an update.
B000WTBMBK|5.0|definitely one of the best and interesting album of these years, deep, true, underground, daring,sweet and powerfull, melancholy but never depressing.  A modern mantra that come from a dark emotional place of the mind. It speaks a universal language, the language of feelings.  hyperdub is a great label. and burial is def his brightnest star. For music lovers.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I've been waiting for PopCap to release a game on the Android OS for a long time, and I must say that Plants vs. Zombies, is an excellent start! The game runs perfectly on my Motorola DROIDX. And I have to say for all of you can't run it on your phone, and feel the need to leave a bad rating, it's not the game's fault that you choose to buy a cheap crappy phone.<br /><br />And I have to thank Amazon and PopCap for offering this as the &quot;Free App Of The Day&quot;!! A superb choice and a amazing game. Now if we can just get Peggle on Android, well I'd be one overly happy customer! 5-stars all the way! If you haven't played this beautiful, hilarious, and killer game, then I suggest you give it a chance. And once you do, you'll find it hard to remember a time when you didn't play games as outstanding as Plants vs. Zombies on your Android phone!
B002OFWG7E|5.0|I really like the Foo Fighters so of course I love their greatest hits.  Its nice to be able to put a CD on and like every song on it.
B000LT2IHI|5.0|This is the best toy my grandson has ever had. He played for hours with this. It assisted him with standing up and motor skills. This went on all trips for his entertainment.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Horrible slowdown compared to the older iphone 3gs. Force a reset on my epic 4g twice. Not worth the money or the free.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Running on modded gtab (because an unmodded gtab is useless). I get inconsistent freezing, sometimes in the main menu, sometimes during the game. The only thing that's consistent is that it always freezes.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Freezes on G2x running  CM7. Seems to be a lot of Tegra 2 issues. Game is fun while it last. Looking forward to an update soon.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|I love this film. Thought it may repel some and maybe controversial and snobbed. This film is a very powerful, evoking film. Showing you, just how complex, diverse and interesting human beings are. There is NOTHING wrong with love. We as humans try to understand it and put a line through it, but there is NO limit, or line because love is indefinent and defined as a never changing aspect of life. It's true, love doesn't change for ANYTHING, it is always there even in tough times. This film will bring you to tears. If not, then it will move you in many more ways than one. It truly will, when I watched it I was blown away by the videography, acting, scenes, EVERYTHING just fit together to make this story the way it is and I take my hate off and appluade this studio for doing this film. I'm so happy it was released in the U.S.. truly I'am since we are a \\"melting pot\\" we need to accept diversity and realize that love has no boundaries. ALSO, keep your sex life, to yourself, it is no one's business who you sleep with at nite (and no I don't just mean sex either.) I loved this film, I would recommend it to ANYONE! (Who has an open mind, of course.) ^__^
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Fun fun fun! The game not only looks beautiful but it runs exceptionally well. It is exactly what you have come to expect from Popcap. Easily the best game on android.
B002VWNICC|5.0|L A Confidential will remain the best film noir (modern) made in at least the last 50 years.  Every actor performs at peak.  The screenwriting is perfect.  The music is haunting and unforgettable.  Casting was surprising but turned out to be excellent and sets and costumes are period exact.   Keep buying the re-issues to keep this classic in your library.  The only other movie I can compare L A Confidential to is Casablanca for first class movie making and lasting value.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This has some good food for thought, although it does have somewhat of a political slant.  Regardless it is a good insight to where and how our food is being prepared.  I definitely recommend watching.
B001412W28|5.0|I have NEVER heard another group come close to capturing the sound that System can produce. Their songs have SO much energy, and more importantly, MEANING! I love them as much for the lyrics as the sound. I cannot stop listening! There was only one song on this album that I am not in love with (U-Fig), and I love Hypnotize and Lonely Day. All the other songs I would rate 8, 9, or 10 out of 10!
B004G5ZXVQ|2.0|COLLAPSE INTO NOW continues R.E.M.'s comeback of sorts, their rediscovery of high energy and a rock 'n' roll spirit after their controversial and critically panned mellow efforts of the middle of the last decade. Unfortunately, part of their solution is to again raise the volume of all parts to the point that the album can't breathe. This is certainly yet another \\"loudness wars\\" casualty, though not as bad as the previous album.<br /><br />While guitarist Peter Buck returned to the fore on the band's last album, COLLAPSE INTO NOW sees him really relish the opportunity to record again. \\"All the Best\\", \\"Blue\\" and \\"Oh My Heart\\" have the flashiest guitars, but if you listen close, he's always doing something interesting.<br /><br />R.E.M. began as a band of limited musical virtuosity whose strong suit was Michael Stipe's idiosyncratic vocals, but on COLLAPSE INTO NOW it's curiously Buck who keeps things going along, while Stipe has almost become a liability. Stipe's voice has become a hoarse yell with little range (just listen to \\"Saturn Returns\\" from REVEAL to see how much he's lost in the last decade). \\"Blue\\" and half of \\"Everyday is Yours to Win\\" employ spoken word instead of actual singing. Stipe's lyrics too are getting awfully dull, with \\"Uberlin\\" employing the singer's stock theme of loving some particular cityscape, and many of the other songs are vacuous pop shout-outs.<br /><br />I'm not one of those fans who thinks the band was finished when they signed to a major label in the late 1980s or when Bill Berry left. Indeed, 2001's REVEAL has never left my regular playlist. But I do feel that now the band's best days are behind them. COLLAPSE INTO NOW isn't bad, but it's mediocre and serves only to dilute the band's discography.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Great fun.only problem I've had is when I select the special item at the end of a level the animation is laggy.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is a fantastic game.  Have been waiting for the Android version since I played on my friends iPhone.  Got it for free, but well worth three bucks.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a sci-fi version of La Femme Nikita, in many ways.  I just couldn't put it down.  The writing was captivating and the story just as much fun (and generally unpredictable).  The characters had some depth, too.<br />The book was as much fun for adults as for teens.  (I can only speak for the adults.)  The only criticism was that the book is being made into a movie and the movie promos basically say what will happen in the book (so if you plan to read the book, DO NOT read anything about the movie until you finish the book).
B0052UZIFA|4.0|It is a no brainer to get this game.  Simply awesome.  Although I miss the Michael Jackson zombie that was in the game originally.
0553582038|5.0|Thank the seven that I read the reviews to \\"A Feast for Crows\\" before I read the book; they set my expectations so low that only a total disaster would have disappointed me.<br /><br />I started out HATING \\"Songs of Fire and Ice\\"...I couldn't stand all the minor characters with their dumb backstories, and the heraldry and Ser this and Ser that...until I got to about page 100 in the first book.  Once I \\"got\\" what Martin was going for I was totally hooked and didn't stop reading until I was done with the four books.  Then I got the fantasy flight card game, and started the HBO series, but that's another story...<br /><br />Anyway, I can imagine if I'd had to wait years and years for A Feast For Crows to come out, and then wait another 8 years (or whatever) for the 5th book to show up, I would have been mortally wounded and frustrated.  However, I'm a late comer to this world, and I just finished the 4th book and the 5th is coming out in a matter of weeks.<br /><br />Ok, this really isn't about me, what I'm trying to say is that a new reader to the series isn't going to hate the 4th book as much as someone who was there from the beginning.  I love just hanging around in Martin's world, and if the machinations of the Dornish (creating yet ANOTHER regent to go to war over!  genius!) and Cersei's cold-war with the Tyrells, and Arya's stay at the House of Black and White, and Brienne's adventures in her search for Sansa, and Littlefinger's fight with the Lords Declarant don't move the story along enough, well heck the 5th book will be out soon!<br /><br />I'm the last person I though would be defending this book, but reading them all at once gives a different perspective than having to wait an increasing number of years between tomes. So if you're new to this as I am, don't be afraid of \\"A Feast for Crows\\".  It's a pretty darned enjoyable read.<br /><br />Like everyone else, I'm looking forward to all the Tyrion and Dany chapters in the next one!<br /><br />PS: Martin has to be the most patient writer in the history of writing.  If I'd been writing \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\", I would have had the OTHERS all over the place.  somehow, he has managed to show them only a couple of times (though people invoke them as a curse on almost every page) since we saw one battle Waymar Royce in the first pages of the first novel.

0762434279|4.0|I've read this book two times in the Past 10 years.   The first time that I read it, it was truly an eye-opener.  The second time, it looked like it lacked all the necessary information.  This book is written in a passionate an energetic way. It is able to succeed in showing us that we are complete financial illiterate. Gives us the basic philosophy behind the financial independence. It is not a practical \\"how to do\\" book. The language is simple and effective. A must buy book. However... If you truly aim for financial independence, this book works only as a motivational starter.
B0046LVCEM|2.0|Hello<br /><br />I had some time ago borrowed and read the book, and it was witty and informative. Read the other reviews about the content of the book.<br /><br />However, now I bought the Kindle Version, and found out that none of the various figures that are crucial to explain certain ciphers have made it into the Kindle Version.<br />Another example: When Singh explains that he has 'hidden' a text by marking some letters on this very page with a little inconspicuous dot below, it defeats the purpose if the Kindle doesn't display those dots.<br /><br />Seriously, get the book, but the real book, not the Kindle Version.<br /><br />Cheers
B00275EGX8|5.0|The best movie I have ever seen! The Hurt Locker\\" opens with a statement presented as fact: \\"War is a drug.\\" Not for everyone, of course. Most combat troops want to get it over with and go home. But the hero of this film, Staff Sgt. William James, who has a terrifyingly dangerous job, addresses it like a daily pleasure. Under enemy fire in Iraq, he defuses bombs. 5 stars, no wonder it won 6 Oscars
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I am a college student. In my first class today, which began at 11:00AM, I started getting incredibly bored 20 minutes into class. I opened this app and began playing Plants Vs. Zombies. I then heard the professor say \\"alright thats all for today, I'll let ya'll go.\\" Yesterday, she let us out 45 minutes early, so I assumed this was the case today. I looked at my watch, and it was 12:30PM. It seemed like only 30 minutes passed.    Good way to pass time.
0425242099|5.0|Sienna Lauren and her family escaped from PsyNet several years ago.  They asked and received refuge amongst the SnowDancer wolf pack.  Since joining the pack, X-Psy Sienna and alpha wolf Hawke have been at war with one another.  Both respectively know in their gut, their gender battle has become a means to conceal their attraction to one another.  Hawke's mate died when he was a child so he fears taking the next step in the relationship with Sienna.  She refuses to step out and risk her heart too as she expects her cold fire skill that she struggles to control will kill her before she turns twenty-five.<br /><br />Meanwhile the Psy Council deploys plans to destroy the SnowDancer and DarkRiver packs.  That is the opening gamut to destroy the opposition to the Council.  Although this will speed up her death, Sienna vows to use her power to save her clan while Hawke pledges to keep his beloved safe though he is unsure how to stop her from deploying the rare cold fire.<br /><br />Psy/Changeling fans will love this great entry that contrasts the long anticipated heated relationship against the backdrop of a heated war.  The story line is fast-paced and loaded with action on the battle front and romantic fronts (there are actually two loving relationships in Kiss of Snow).  Nalini Singh provides what may be the romantic fantasy of the year.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
0393338827|5.0|I love how Lewis researched and developed the protagonists in this book. Each of the main characters started out as a separate chapter and slowly (and in some cases with years of research) came to reach a similar conclusion about the sub prime mortgage scene. From that point on, the characters are intertwined as the sub prime apocalypse unravels in a narrative not unlike what you'd see in a Hollywood movie. Unknowingly crossing paths, and riding on each others coat tails, our main characters are on a hunt for treasure paved by the ignorance and greed of major financial institutions and credit rating agencies. I have not been as enthralled in a book in this category since \\"When Genius Failed\\". Had to finish it in 4 days! A++++++++++++ would read again!
B003UD7JEE|5.0|One of the best new shows to come out of the CW, although it did take a while to grow on me. It actually has a strong pilot and there's nothing you could call actively bad about the first few episodes, but I must admit that it wasn't really must-watch tv fo me at first either. This all changes at about midway through the season when the writers start piling on the twists, and you are left on the edge of your seat every episode. I'd say the episode when Nikita gets trapped in Division is when the show really goes from good to great    An absolute must-watch overall, and I've got my fingers crossed for some great extras as the three leads all seem very appreciative of the fans, and I'm sure they would love to do commentaries and take part in interviews discussing how it all got started etc. I would love commentaries featuring all three leads, so I really hope someone someone considers asking them as I know that Maggie especially as a lot of imput into the show, and would surely love to do something like that for the fans    My one quipple is that I'm not very keen on the cover! It'a a bit too sexualised for my tastes, and I would feel awkward buying something like that from stores to be honest, or asking for it for a gift. That might just be my own hang-ups, but I know that Maggie wasn't thrilled either with the sexed-up bikini shots from the pilot, so I wish they could use a picture that shows off a litte less thigh...    No complaints otherwise though, and I've already planning to ask for this boxset for a Christmas gift (with hopes of the cover art not causing to many raised eyebrows among my relatives LOL)
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Does not work on my Droid X. Why does it only work on some??? Fix this ASAP and make people happy!
B003U4UNPK|1.0|The show itself is great. But if you're going to pay $21 for ONE season, might as well pay $7.99 for a month of Netflix and get ALL the seasons at once there!
B004Z2TUGE|2.0|It was an okay movie.  I was disappointed that all the action seemed to be in the last twenty minutes.
1603420398|5.0|Excellent book for those who enjoy visuals in full color.  The product was sent quickly and is highly recommended.  Very motivational.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I was thrilled when I heard PopCap was bringing PvZ to Android. I'd played on my iphone but haven't played since switching to Android (even though my iphone sits in the dresser as a makeshift itouch). The gameplay, graphics, etc. are comparable to those on iOS, which I expected and appreciate. However, as others have said, my phone going to sleep constantly is frustrating. I have a large screen and set the timeout to only 15 seconds to preserve battery... which means unless I keep a finger on the screen, my game doesn't stay open. Please fix this one issue!   (Now if only I could somehow magically port my iOS game progress....)  :D
B003V99B16|5.0|Ordered for my wife.  She listens to it daily.  Nice to listen to as you fall asleep.  Sweet dreams!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Pros:  It has by far the best graphics I have seen on Android.  There are certainly differences but fans of the original game should not be disappointed.  Good controls to be able to manage on smaller screens.    Cons:  If you pause and lock the screen it has to reload into memory when you turn it back on.    Bugs:  On my Sprint Epic 4G the game quits and I lose my progress if the phone rings / text message / alarm goes off.  I suspect it could have to do with Android inactive app garbage collection.  I guess this game calls for airplane mode.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|I don't know one thing about Facebook and I don't have any interest in it what so ever. Having said that, I thought this film was very entertaining. Yes, I was hesitant to watch it, but my wife convinced me and I'm glad she did. I purchased the Blu-Ray and I plan on watching it again in the future. Incredible acting.
B004DK5CW4|4.0|This was a great old-fashioned family film, in the vein of the pre-animation days. Based on the true story of Secretariat, the last horse to win the Triple Crown, and his 'housewife' owner (who made headlines herself at the time), played by Diane Lane. The racing sequences are masterfully filmed, and kept me on the edge of my seat even though I knew how they ended. The family drama was perhaps a little weak, in the sense of being not completely fleshed out, but other than that, this film was very solid and enjoyable.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is an entertaining game for people of all aged. Highly recommended to get but be careful it is very addictive.
B001AQT0OU|1.0|This disc will not play on my LG BD300 Blu-Ray player. I have other Region Free discs that will. Downloaded the latest BD300 firmaware and no luck. The film itself is a 5 star film. The disc plays fine on my Sherwood BDP-5004 BR player.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I was happy to see this pop up in free apps this morning. Almost immediately after I installed though, icons started to dissapear off my desktop. I had to remove the game and restore my settings. Because I wanted to play the game, I tried again. Same results. I'm done.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have been waiting a long time for this game to come to Android. Worth the wait! Even if you didn't get it for free, its still worth $2.99
B001CEE1XA|4.0|It's as simple as this......if you like the Clone Wars TV series, you'll enjoy this film. If you haven't, then you'll be wondering what the heck is going on and who are all the new characters. Even for you Star Wars fans.
B001HN6918|5.0|This is one of the very few films where I can say I liked the sequel better than the original. All the best aspects of the original are here - the stunning Chinese scenery and settings, Jack Black at his most amusing, odes to classic martial arts movies - but I actually felt the story was a bit stronger. The new 'bad guy' is a Peacock bent on reclaiming the kingdom he was banned for after attacking all the Pandas in the land. The Peacock is beautifully animated, as are all the other characters. Jack Black's Panda must confront his 'inner demons' to move to a new level in his martial arts, and it adds a depth that wasn't there in the first film. Overall, an excellent film for the whole family.
0783225733|5.0|What more can I say?  Needed this for a business meeting and it arrived in perfect condition and just in time for my meeting.
B001AQMBJG|1.0|This Blu Ray Disc will not play on my LG BD300 Player. I have other Region Free discs that do. I just downloaded the latest Firmaware and no luck. It plays fine on my Sherwood BDP-5004 Blu-ray player. The film itself is a 5 star film.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this game, very addicting I can't put the game down. I hope they make more like this one!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Finally it has come to android. I love this game, my kids love this game. Game runs smooth no problems what so ever
B004A8ZWT2|1.0|I will keep this short. Angelina's character was horrible. She barely spoke the entire movie. When she did, she was so monotone that it drove me and my friend's crazy. The storyline was bad and very predictable. Depp is definitely forgettable in this film as well. I never saw the original film but it doesn't matter. IT'S BAD!
B000CNE092|5.0|Being familiar with Don Bluth films such as An American Tail and All Dogs Go To Heaven, I was quite unprepared for Anastasia.  It is quite simply a masterpiece, a significant step up from the more familiar early films.  From the quality of the drawing (rich & vivid colors, capturing light most remarkably) to the original music (yes, they burst into song but the melodies are quite compelling and not syrupy at all) to the well-known voice talents, this film really drew me in.  The story is not at all what one would expect for a movie aimed at kids:  Russian Tsar Nicholas II's entire family was arrested, confined and eventually brutally executed by the Bolsheviks in 1918, but it was speculated at the time that one young daughter, Anastasia, escaped from the palace and so survived.  The film's focus is on the orphaned girl and her search for her family, it is handled well and even believably (although DNA evidence has since disproven the possibility).  As well, the bonus features on Disc 2 of the Family Fun Pack edition included \\"The Making of Anastasia\\", a behind-the-scenes look at the entire production with commentary by Gary Goldman & Don Bluth, which was excellent.  I highly recommend this as a must-have for the family collection.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|A fun little time waster, plenty of available options and upgrades to keep things interesting while defending your home against waves of zombies. Played it until my battery got low, plugged it in (with a wall charger), and it still wound up dying, so this thing must eat a ton of CPU cycles. Seems to a bit during new item pickup animations on my Nexus One, so anything weaker than a 1GHz chip might suffer some performance issues.    This thing's a blast, though. Totally worth the price.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|When attempting to open the application, it starts, goes to a black screen and closes. Doesn't give an option to report an issue. Using droid incredible
B0052UZIFA|5.0|ive been playing on my ipad for the longest time, good to see for android. the best part is that nothijg has changed
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I don't usually bother with writing reviews, but this game is fantastic!  It is simple enough to understand and play, but gets more and more challenging throughout. I'm not even sure yet how many variations of plants and zombies there will end up being because I've played it for hours and still am just a portion of the way through. 100x better than any other game I've tried so far.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|What started as a quick 5 min check out game turned into a 2 hour zombie killing session.. Beware, very addicting :-)
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I am seriously annoyed.  I can not get this to even open.  I hope that there will be a fix soon. when I can actually play I will be adjusting my review.  UPDATE:  I for got to update this...It fixed REALLY quickly and I don't have the EVO anymore I have the samsung galaxy S2 and it works
B004GCPJDQ|4.0|Very nice.  Turn off mouse (Very important, doesn't charge when on, only downside or it would get 5 *'s).  Put it on and it's at 100% when you use it again (at least for me ;)
B0052UZIFA|1.0|i have a samsung moment which the website showed the gamme would work for.  i have over 100 mb free on phone, and over 1 gb of space on sd card.  i am unable to even download the game, keeps saying not enough memory to show the game.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Long awaited, but worth the wait. This game is easy to learn, highly entertaining, and very polished. Please give this game a try.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I knew when Popcap said both in May this one would be the last day. The wait was worth it. I didn't put my Xoom down all day. Every time I got a strategy right, and bored, it changes up. Perfect timing. Graphics only lag picking up the flower/note at level end. Great game!
0553062182|4.0|A while ago, I read [[ASIN:0761123695 The Introvert Advantage: How to Thrive in an Extrovert World]] by Marti Olsen Laney. This book came up on Amazon as books I might find interesting because of that, and reviewers mentioned it too. A Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) is essentially someone who's more sensitive than others - to moods, to settings, to stimuli, and so on. The world is an overwhelming place to be, especially for introverts, and even more so for HSP.    Like \\"The Introvert Advantage\\", this book has a list of statements to which you answer True/False (or Yes/No) and then you tally up the results and see how much of an HSP you are, if at all. I got 18/23, so definitely a HSP but not a terribly severe one according to the questionnaire. Perhaps that's why I felt for the most part, the book wasn't as appealing to me as the Laney book, and she in turn is clear to point out that there's a difference between being shy, being introverted and being a HSP. Aron's definitions seem muddled and while she too points out that there's a difference between the three, the difference is a bit more unclear.    To me, it seemed that HSPs are shy, timid cry-babies who live their lives being scared most of the time. That's not really what the author means at all, but that's how a lot of the book came across. I'm quiet, I'm not actually very shy at all, and I'm not scared of going to parties, I just don't like them. There's a difference.    As the book went along, though, I did feel as if it was starting to make more sense and speak to me more, but I never felt quite the same \\"OMG, that explains MY WHOLE LIFE!!\\" feeling from it. It does make a few very good points that I can take away from it, and sure, it does explain a few things that aren't necessarily covered by being an introvert (you can be an HSP if you're extrovert as well, it says, but introversion is a lot more common - to which I say \\"yeah, duhh\\" because to me, they seem to go hand in hand).    In the end, it has somepointers that you could show your doctor and others that you can show your boss, and I just feel as if I should write down the ones for \\"working with a HSP\\", frame them and put them on my desk, because I agree with them wholeheartedly and they are, for lack of a better expression, \\"so me\\", and if you're a very introverted HSP, people assume a lot of things about you, most of which aren't particularly kind, let alone true. It's nice to have something to refer to.    \\"The Highly Sensitive Person\\" is a useful book if you think you might be a HSP or know someone who is. It's another step in figuring out why I am the way I am and helping me understand myself, and for that I'm grateful. Even if I'm not a shy, timid cry-baby.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|It would be five stars but when I receive a call, text, etc.  Or if the screen cuts off you lose the game your on and you have to restart the level your on. Besides that it's a 5 star game I love it iam so addicted. Sprint samsung epic 4G!
B0008ENICU|5.0|Hilarity and drama all in one. Rosalind Russell has become my new favorite actress. Norma Shearer made me smile as soon as her character came on screen. Joan Crawford is perfect as the seductress.
B004DL5K2K|5.0|While I enjoy the original Black Sabbath albums about as much as any guy my age, I've never been fanatical about Sabbath in general or Ozzy in particular. Therefore the butchered 2002 CD re-release with the original bass and drum tracks removed and re-recorded was not enough to tempt me into replacing my vinyl copies. But this 2011 release is another matter. Not only are the original performances restored, the sound is crisp and clear. (The two bonus tracks aren't themselves worth making the purchase, but they're also nice to have. The more I listen to the acoustic mix of \\"Goodbye to Romance\\", the more I prefer it to the original version.) Listening to this album with fresh ears, I was also surprised that--unlike the early Sabbath albums--it doesn't sound all that dated. Recommended for new and old fans alike.
B00005JKZV|5.0|This second part of the trilogy is beyond reproach as the characters are caught in the middle of the storm.  The mise en scene (this is includes the characters, scenery, picture, props, et al)was spectacular.  As everything was filmed in New Zealand, the beauty of the country cannot be dimissed.  Peter Jackson's attempt of creating and establishing communities with their own characteristics ring true as well as the actors go over and beyond just acting, they give life to the characters so it feels as though we are watching something that could be real; we are transported to a world that is not us watching a movie, we are watching an adventure.  THUMBS UP & THUMBS UP!!!
0425242099|3.0|I rarely notice book pacing if I'm caught up in the story, however, with Kiss of Snow, about half way through I was muttering \\"Just get to the story already!\\"  I felt as if I was treading water waiting on the party boat to arrive.... and when it did, it was a party barge, not a cruise liner and someone had drank all the beer and the band was on 1 hour break.<br /><br />IOW, in KOS, A lot of cutting that could have been done, with a simple tightening up or combining of scenes, with quicker resolutions to some issues would have kept the romantic tension high and increased the drama instead of slogging it down to a near catatonic stop before the 'boom' that was the rushed and over the top ending.  There were easily 100-150 pages that could have been cut with judicious editing and re-arranging of events.<br /><br />Yes, I know there was a lot of information to impart.  Yes, I know there was a lot of loose ends to tie up.  Yes, I know the author's intention was to build passion between Hawke and Sienna...but the exact opposite happened.  Yes, they needed to have their emotional revelations---but not one or two sentences and then days pass as other events happen.  After a dozen confrontations with teensy bits of info given, many that read the same as the other (knock on door, make out, phone rings for emergency-leave, repeat x 2.  Dancing on bar-- Hawk comes...dance on bar again, Hawk comes.  Romantic tension in dojo x 2.  Run in woods x 4 etc)  Plus many of the same conversations repeated- instead of building to an emotional climax, you're emotionally drained and wanting it over.  Or feeling used.  As with anything,  dragging the tension out too long, numbness sets in.  By the time the two finally have their big moment, in the last quarter of the book,  you're simply too tired to care. It was uber-anticlimatic and frustrating and too little too late.<br /><br />Especially when the undercurrent was a constant state of \\"we're about to go to war.\\"  Yes, I can suspend belief as well as the next guy, but whe you have the leader of the pack taking off to finally rub pelts with his sweetie when the enemy is about to attack at any moment, your eyes roll.  Especially when it's clear that the Wild Monkey Sex could have happened much sooner with about a half dozen less of those above mentioned repeated moments which were simply redundant, filler and not building towards anything but reader exhaustion.<br /><br />When you slog to the middle of battle readiness to suddenly have a party zone happen because the enemy is having a case of Montezuma's Revenge, the 'contrived as heck' bell rings.  Your changling soliders that are on battle ready status suddenly pull a Judy Garland-Mickey Rooney moment of \\"I know, let's build something fun!\\" that again, was contrived and eyerolling.  When you have a scene from X-men suddenly happen in the end of your book, you think \\"WTF just happened here? I know this chick from the movies!\\"  At this point, I was commited to finish, but so disappointed and frustrated, I had to make myself finish.<br /><br />I will say that the ending is where all the energy lies and where the pacing is fast and interesting.  Yes, there is a bit of a deus ex machina finale with Sienna's gift just fixing every little ole thing that was wrong (or maybe that's a Mary Sue Moment, I don't know).  My issue is not only with the story but the manner in which it was delivered-- the story was adequate and could have been stunning in a condensed size with less packing peanuts and a smaller box.<br /><br />I will re-read the last few chapters to clear up a few questions in my head.  I'll probably skim the book again for some scenes that I enjoyed, but re-read the entire thing?  No way in heck!

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love the game! IT looks good and plays well on my T-Mobile G2 and Nook color tablet. Beware it murders battery power so make sure and plan for that.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Does not save the most recent level completed in adventure mode, if a phone call is received during gameplay. Forced me to start the game over from the beginning, but it saved my username for some reason. Did not save my achievements. Also, the app is incredibly slow to load, and appears to freeze for almost a minute before the app will launch. On a Motorola Droid2 global. It's unfortunate, since I love this game on the iphone, and never had these types of problems. This app is still too buggy to have been released.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this game is loads of fun.  its very addictive.  plays well on my ego.  I highly recommend this game to anyone. fun fun fun.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Unplayable on my phone.  Performance is very laggy and unstable.  In 4 attempts, the only way I could terminate the app was by power cycling.
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|Kudos to Director Caruso for another nail biter! Even though it was a bit shy on the why of the aliens I thought it was action intense and great acting on the part of all involved!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Not sure about 3 bucks for it. It's fun in small amounts but kind of a simple design and decion based system. Another food product by popcap
B004K4AUZW|5.0|\\"Born This Way\\" by Lady Gaga is a musical kalediscope of pop, rock, and dance, (with different songs that actually work together).  The appeal to many of these songs on this compilation is that many of the meanings to the songs have various meanings to them such as the quirky \\"Government Hooker\\" and the \\"Fashion of His Love\\".  I am only guessing that \\"Government Hooker\\" is about being many things to those around you (subconsciously acting in accordance to how someone expects you to act). \\"Fashion of His Love\\" appears to be comparing how a love of certain fashion is almost related to when you intensely care about someone. However, my two favorite songs on this catchy cd are \\"Heavy Metal Lover\\" and \\"Edge of Glory\\".  \\"Heavy Metal Lover\\" seems to be a musical track about group love.  \\"The Edge of Glory\\" is a daring song about taking controversial chances in the personal life arena.  The easiest way to determine if you are going to like \\"Born this Way\\" is if you are open to enjoy pop, rock,and dance music. In addition, I have recently been to one of her concerts where she put much effort and fun energy into her musical performances. This compilation is similiar in the sense that you get a sense that she put forth much of that exciting energy and fused it in her songs on the \\"Born This Way\\" collection.
B002ZG997C|5.0|As a fan of comedies, I as skeptical about watching this movie.  I have found that through my life anything that has suspense or extreme drama causes me unease; this was not one of those movies.  I really enjoy the story and the acting was wonderful.  Great lesson!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Very rare that I give something a full five stars, but I love this game! It's great whether it's on my PC, my Nintendo DS, and today, courtesy of Amazon, it's now on my phone, gratis. Was a little concerned that even though my phone - a Virgin Mobile Optimus V - wasn't on the \\"not compatible\\" list, that it might still not run it, since there are a few apps here and there that my phone won't run. Gave it a download anyway this AM while I was still within my home wi-fi network before I went to work, but didn't get a chance to try it until lunch, when I actually had to force myself to stop playing so that I could actually eat (lunch, not brains, lol).<br /><br />And no worries, it works GREAT on the Optimus V. Definitely lives up to the PC and DS versions I've played before. Wasn't sure how plant placement would work on such a small screen using my finger to move things around, but they give you the option to either tap the plant to select then tap again where you want it to go, or tap and drag it to where you want it. And I like the white cross-hair bars they put on the screen so even if your finger is in the way and you can't actually see where you're placing it, the cross-hairs tell you exactly where it is. It's actually more accurate than trying to use the stylus on my DS, IMHO. Thank you PopCap, for making this game for Android, and thank you Amazon for making it free today. Now I don't have to lug my DS with me if I want to play it on the go. Excellent game, whatever the format!<br /><br />\\"Zombies... they're coming...\\" \\"BRAAAAAAINS!\\" :D
B0052UZIFA|2.0|This game only takes up 252KB(0.252MB) on your phone, but the total download is 75MB(74.64MB to be exact). The game is installed to your SD card, so you need at least 75MB free to even install(which I did have). It took several attempts to download via Wi-Fi because of the size. Others may enjoy this game, but it is not worth the time and effort it takes to download this abnormally huge game in my opinion. The game is defense style, but really slow and boring. I love playing [[ASIN:B004UBUK4Q HexDefense]], but this is just agonizing. Plants shooting stuff at zombies? Really?! If the size were much smaller, I would maybe recommend a purchase @ $1.49.
B004X0XA82|4.0|First of all, I like Fleet Foxes...some of the time. I have 2-4 songs off their EP and first album but never got into the work as a whole.     Why? Because it's beautiful but it all fades together. It drifts off into harmonic space without ever coming back to earth.     I do like this album. I bought and listen to the entire thing often. Always together. It seems to work best as a whole. It reminds me of being 20 and optimistic and curious and simultaneously in love with and troubled by the world. The sound remains the same (soft folk melodies and harmonies dripping beauty to an almost uncomfortable degree) but Pecknold is more focused this time around. He's asking more questions, pushing himself, then coming back to what comforts him, around and around.     There's not the pop quality certain of his other songs have (\\"Mykonos\\") but there is a step forward lyrically and internally. This guy is so young, talented, and optimistic. It makes me want to see where he goes.     Favorites: \\"Battle Kinzie\\" (even better live) \\"Helplessness Blues\\" \\"Lorelai\\" \\"The Shrine/Argument\\"     *Note: if you do not like folk, particularly atmospheric folk, you will not like this.*
B0052UZIFA|5.0|amazing game. it plays perfect on MT4G.just as good as ios version.thanks to popcap for finally releasing this game on android.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Thank you PopCap for bringing the wonderful PvZ to Android.  Its a great game and I am thrilled to have it on my phone.  Hope more of your games will be ported soon. And thanks for the free download.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Absolutely love this game!  I had problems getting it past the load screen on my LG Optimus T, but I followed the instructions that a previous review had and it worked!  Thought I would share it again!<br /><br />If you are having problems getting it past the loading screen, go to your settings - application settings - manage applications - find plants vs zombies and click 'clear data'.  I did this and I haven't had that problem again!  Have fun!!!
B004RKXN44|5.0|I've been waiting for this book since we first got a glimpse of Hawk and Sienna and this book did not disappoint. It was amazing!   Hawke and Sienna's chemistry was spot on an beliveable especy given both of their pasts. This was an explosve book for an explosive couple I expected nothing else from the amazingly talented Nalini Singh!!
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I just got a matching pair of sonic screwdrivers for me and my daughter.  She is absolutely thrilled and has been using it to open every door in our house.    I had planned to buy a Gen 11 for her and this one for me, but the reviews for the newer one were so disappointing that I went for a set.  The construction seems pretty solid for toy-grade plastic.  It seems durable enough if handled with some care.  In our testing the UV pen nib seemed a little dry.  That's not a major feature for me, so it's not that big a deal.  I'll probably spend some time figuring out a way to refill it, though.    Lights and sound effects are dead on, and from a short distance it looks more solid.  If you're a fan of Doctor Who this is a great addition to your collection, or your wardrobe, or your toolbox... depending on your level of commitment.  I think any fan would love to receive this as a gift.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|I'd like to ask George Lucas and Steven Spielberg why...why did they make and release this piece of crap?  They certainly don't need the cash, and they just as certainly weren't under the impression that they had an Oscar-winning classic on their hands.  This movie sucks on multiple levels.  It sucks as a story because...there's no story.  It sucks as a thriller because...you got it, no thrills.  It sucks as a sequel because it smells so bad it calls the whole franchise into question.  Plus, the special effects were mediocre and unnecessary.  George and Steven knew they had a stink-bomb and they knew it long before the wrap party.  I just thought they had a scrap more integrity than this, that they wouldn't unleash this dog and sic it on their loyal fans.  That's what I get for expecting any degree of integrity from anyone in Hollywood.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|After such a long wait it is really disappointing to see the awful quality of the graphics in the android version.  what the hell, popcap? !
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Addicting game! Graphics are good and it flows well, can not complain! Id say this has been my favorite free app yet!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I'm not sure what the heck people are talking about but the graphics are beautiful on my Driod x. The only time the pictures get pixelated are when it zooms in the new plant. I haven't beat the game yet but I don't see a minigames option.  As another person said I would like the screen to stay on so it doesn't have to reload the damn game everytime.  I would also like a graphical setting.
B004R10L4S|1.0|I give this film one star for being .999% pure political propaganda. Perfect movie for Communist Penn. He loves to drag America through the mud.<br /><br />I esspecially hated the part where Penn is constanly berating his companions when they have an opinion about the crisis on the news. It screams \\"shut up average americans\\" because your opinions are just based on racism and ignorant anger; and people like you need to let societies politacally motivated elite handle these complicated matters.<br /><br />This is an elitist lefties dream movie.
B0041KKYCY|4.0|I haven't seen the original movie yet (have it on order from Netflix) so can't compare the two yet.<br /><br />I can't say I enjoyed \\"I Spit On Your Grave\\" because I don't believe it is the type of movie most people ENJOY.  But it was haunting, thought provoking, viscerally wrenching.  I think, as a woman, it really had an impact on me.  What would I do in the same circumstances?  Maybe not as extreme as the victim in the movie but who really knows how far we will go unless we are pushed over the edge of all reason.<br /><br />The physical rape scenes were hard to watch but almost as hard to watch were the verbal and emotional rape sequences leading up to them.<br /><br />There were some vague \\"huh how did that happen' moments after the rapes that could have been explained better.  The revenge scenes were brutal - but fit the crimes. The movie definitely deserved its NR rating.  This is not one I would recommend anyone under the age of 18 seeing and a lot of adults won't want to see the violence either.  But I think it was well made for the type of movie it is.  Good actors, good camera work (too good sometimes).<br /><br />Edited June 6, 2011:<br />I just watched the 1978 version [[ASIN:B004BLTNM0 I Spit on Your Grave - Day of the Woman]].  I was very impressed with it.  Both versions have their strengths.  The cinematography on the original was superb - clear, wonderful color, interesting perspectives.  There was no background musical score and I think that added a lot to the movie - you could hear every sound and the silences added to the drama.<br /><br />The 2011 version had much more of a psychological/emotional buildup to the rapes, which added to the scare factor.  And the revenge sequence in the newer movie was much more brutal.  Also, I thought the part of Matthew was much better played in the newer version, not such a caricature of a mentally troubled young man.<br /><br />In the 1978 version, there was more nudity - male and female; much more solely physical rape scenes - I can definitely understand the NR rating, ESPECIALLY for 1978. An extra on the DVD for this version is a discussion with the director, Meir Zarchi, which was enlightening.<br /><br />The stories aren't exactly alike but both are very good, for the genre they are. Both actresses playing Jennifer Hills - Camille Keaton (1978) and Sarah Butler (2010) did outstanding jobs.R rating, ESPECIALLY for 1978.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|This movie is for older teenagers and not for young children due to the materials that is filmed in this movie
0857680986|5.0|As probably many others who purchased this book I was working off of the PDFs that are readily available online. When I saw they were reproducing this book I immediately pre-ordered and was anticipating the date it would ship. When it arrived I was blown away by the quality and how good it felt in my hands. I am not one to buy a book just to display, but this is one beautifully crafted book. As others mentioned it is worth every penny and so much more, especially to those of us who have never actually seen the original and are working off of scrapped together PDFs.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Plants vs Zombies is a great game. I've been addicted to it since I downloaded it yesterday.  And it was free!!!
1400052181|5.0|Fascinating reading, all the aspects of this story held my attention to the very end. The author's research is commendable.Everyone should read this tribute to science and the questions it presents to all of us today.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Love the game on my ipad. So I got this as soon as I saw it last night. Playing a bit and it's been slow and choppy so far. I have the sm samsung droid charge, which was released 3 weeks ago and it really shouldn't be this bad. Hope they update it soon to fix the memory leak and performance issue.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Do note that i mentioned that it runs nicely, not great, on my phone . that is because the game dies work and actually runs pretty smoothly with no glitches or errors. so far there has been no force close happening, which is very good. however, at certain scenes such as when receiving new plants, the cut scene stutters badly, like a movie runninf at only 5-10 fps. and at times, the animation also suffers. graphic looks pretty smooth although at times you can see some pixelation. now all these issues might be because the atrix 4g has a QHD screen, which has a higher resoution than most phones, and propably this game isnt optimized for such resolution. and then again, they did mention its not optimized for tablets' resolutions .<br /><br />great game nonetheless! i've played it in pc before and it's still as good as always.
0307719774|5.0|I am a lawyer, but not a writer. I recently found a diary I wrote in high school, but in the 20 or so years since that time, I have not found the patience to write much other than what I am required to write at work. I was inspired by the blog [...] to start writing at least something every day. I found this journal and thought it was perfect for me - I don't even have to come up with a topic if I don't want to.     I have written in it every day (with a few catch-up days) since I bought it over a month ago. The questions are simple and I generally answer them on the first line or two. I then write another line or two describing my day. The perfect amount of space for someone like me who is very succinct and does not want to spend a lot of time on this.     The only thing I wish the journal had was a ribbon to keep my place. Other than that, it is perfect and well worth the price.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I purchased PvZ for my iPhone and it was one of the games I'd lose that made me hesitant to switch to an Android. I made the switch anyway and just kept my iphone charged so I could play PvZ. This downloaded fine over my wi-fi and loaded the first time (and each subsequent time on my VM Optimus V (a pretty low end device).<br /><br />The game play is just as good as my iphone, although it loads much faster on my Android. I love that each of my kids can have their own game and not mess up my save. I wish more games offered the ability to switch users.

B0001EFTVA|5.0|The main characters of Tokyo Godfathers are three homeless people: a middle-aged alcoholic named Gin, former drag queen Hana, and a runaway girl named Miyuki.  The film opens on Christmas Eve, with the three rummaging through the garbage.  As they look, they hear a cry of a baby.  The three discover a newborn baby girl, with a note asking someone to take good care of her, as well as a bag containing clues to the parents' identities.  Hana names the girl Kiyoko, which means \\"pure child.\\"<br /><br />As the three go on a journey to find the baby's parents, they rescue a high-ranking yakuza man who is trapped under a car.  It turns out the man knows the owner of the club that Kiyoko's mother used to visit; the club owner is marrying the yakuza man's daughter.  The yakuza man takes the three and the baby to the wedding, where they learn the baby's mother is named Sachiko, and are provided an address.  However, the party is interrupted by a Hispanic man who was disguised as a maid; he turns out to be a hit man.  After trying to shoot the yazuka man, the hit man takes Miyuki and Kiyoko hostage.  The film continues the adventures of the three and what they must go through to try to return Kiyoko where she belongs.<br /><br />Like Kon's other works, nothing is as it seems on the surface.  As the three characters go on their journey to reunite Kiyoko with her family, secrets about each one is revealed.  The animation in the film also helps to punctuate the story being told the film.<br /><br />The DVD release of Tokyo Godfathers is packaged with an illustration by Satoshi Kon.  The copy of the DVD that I have came with an illustration of Miyuki.  The DVD itself contains a making of documentary and previews.  The documentary runs for twenty-two minutes, and it has Japanese language with English subtitles.  The documentary provides background on the film, as well as on the main three voice actors.  The three voice actors are also interviewed.  The documentary also includes interviews with Satoshi Kon and some of the members of the production staff.  It was a rather well-done documentary, and the interviews with Satoshi Kon reinforced how much the anime industry lost with his passing in 2010.  The previews on the disc are for Tokyo Godfathers, Astro Boy, Cowboy Bebop: The Movie, Cyborg 009, Memories, Metropolis, Returner, and Steamboy.<br /><br />Tokyo Godfathers is a great anime film to watch at Christmas time.  However, with the violence and brief bits of nudity, it's not an all-ages film.  On the DVD box, it says that the film is rated PG-13.  Tokyo Godfathers is a very well-made film, and should be in the DVD library of anyone who appreciates the work of Satoshi Kon.<br /><br />I wrote this review after watching a copy of this DVD that I received as a gift from my husband.and some of the members of the production staff.

B004V9J3HM|3.0|Ok  Don't get me wrong. I am a huge fan of Neal and Spock's Beard. The musicianship is superb as usual as well as the production. The problem I have is that since Testimony all the albums have sounded the same. They all have the same formula and contain the same religious lyrics.Maybe Neal, it's time to go back to your basics, get out of the preaching and write a great rock and roll album! Just an idea.
B00005OC0G|1.0|Yikes...this is frightful.  Ms. Mutter's performance is a mess in so many ways and places that a taffy pull was the metaphor that kept intruding on my consciousness....s-t-r-e-t-c-h and fold and s-t-r-e-t-c-h and fold the music to the point of making me yell something rude at the speakers.  I don't listen to music to hear the performer play the instrument per se, I listen to hear the performer play and perhaps illuminate the music.  I didn't get my nickel's worth here.  The only illumination was the glow from my impatient-with-the-antics eyes glaring into the middle distance.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I can go on playing this for hours if it was not for my dead battery life. great little game.

0792163710|5.0|This film is the archetypal treatment of the killer who is trying to make good, only to find violence following him.  All the films of the same theme after this pale by comparison and there are echos in so many contemporary films, even the Bourne Trilogy.<br /><br />Alan Ladd, of whom I think as a film noire actor, delivers a warm and sensitive performance, perhaps the best of his career.  He takes a job as a farm worker, in a town where there is a serious conflict.  The farmer is a good and simple man, who understands a lot about Shane; his son admires him as a romantic figure, idolizing him as a tough, real man in comparison to the hard working father.  The mother is attracted to him, too, but Shane will not make unseemly moves and even seeks to downplay the son's admiration.  Of course, Shane is drawn into the conflict, which is a tragedy for his hopes, even as he does the right thing.<br /><br />It is very sad that Shane knows he must move on.  His fate, it seems, is sealed.  Just as I did as a child, I found this wonderfully moving.  There are many fabulous scenes, such as the one where Shane and the farmer enter a brawl in the city, while the son watches and bites a peppermint stick with each punch.  The child understands much more than he is credited with, indeed, he is the emotional center of the film.  It is a genuine masterpiece even if it became a formula for later, inferior productions.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  This is hollywood magic that truly works.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|The Pacific is an experience that you never want to personally take part of unless you love grime and blood and deliberately want to lose your humanity.  The War in the Pacific during War World Two had several unique circumstances that set it apart from the European Theater. Many viewers found these circumstances so disorienting that for a moment they thought they were watching a mini-series about Vietnam War and not World War Two.  These people then unjustly give \\"The Pacific\\" a bad review, citing excessive foul language (more then what was used in Band of Brothers) massive splatter movie gore, and several sex scenes. Some viewers seem to think that movie is insulting to the Marines of the 1st Division that did a lot of fighting, portraying them as dehumanized killing machines that executed prisoners and gunned down civilians.<br /><br />The harsh reality of the situation and history is that \\"Pacific\\" did accurately portrayal the meat grinder that is Pacific Theater of Operations of World War Two.<br /><br />A common Japanese Soldier of the Imperial Army is more sadistic then an elite Waffen SS storm trooper, combat wise. Imperial Army fanaticism could easily be compared to the fanatics of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, they literal compared American and British soldiers to demons, much like how Islamic fundies refere to America as \\"The Great Satan\\" and warn if they don't stop American troopers they will rape every woman and child, and majority of Japanese foot soldier bought it hook line and sinker, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of POWs. The common Japanese army soldier had even more distain and revulsion of us then we did of them.<br /><br />Japanese Warrior culture also had a thing called gyokusai, literal meaning \\"Glorious Death\\", which lead to literally thousands of Japanese soldiers dying in World War I era charges into machine gun area fire. During the Battle of Saipan 22,000 civilians, not soldiers, civilians, committed suicide, and out of the 31,000 combatants that where there, only 900 surrendered.<br /><br />The hideous amount of gore, not just blood but entrails, exposed rips, shredded arms, and even one hallowed out head that one leatherneck casually threw rocks into only adds to the nauseating verisimilitude of what our grandparents went through that tarnished the souls of otherwise good people. Profanity was ramped the ration of soldiers dropping f-bombs in the pacific to soldiers in the Atlantic is easily 5 to 1.<br /><br />Marines are human, meaning they cuss, they bleed, and from time to time the even copulate.

014241543X|5.0|Maybe I've been living under a rock, but I'd never heard of Gayle Forman's If I Stay until just a few months ago when the blogosphere started buzzing about the novel's sequel, Where She Went. I really wasn't sure what to make of it when I first saw the cover and read the dramatic title. I pretty much just brushed it off until I saw so many people raving about it. Could it really be that amazing? My curiosity got the better of me and, being the person that I am, I had to start with the first book in the series, so I picked up If I Stay, even though I wasn't sure what to expect.    If I Stay explores the life and tragic car accident of teenager Mia. Born and raised in a quirky, non-traditional family, Mia has always loved classical music and, most importantly, playing cello -an unexpected contrast to her parents' love of rock music. Despite this, she pushes through, and follows her dreams. Until the day of the car accident that left her life in pieces -pieces that she may never be able to put back together.    Though short, If I Stay is a compelling, unforgettable novel. In less than 10 pages, I had been completely pulled into Mia's life, become fully invested in her and her family, and even cried. Forman does an amazing job of building characters and painting a chilling, believable experience that feels all-too-real...almost like the author had been there before. The emotions in this novel are incredible, real and honest. I cried more than once throughout If I Stay, and thought it was completely worthwhile.    The story is told through a series of multi-viewpoint flashbacks that go between the accident and its aftermath, and the story of Mia's life and family, ranging from their dysfunction and quirks to endearments. From Mia's middle school days as a budding cellist to her unexpected relationship with Adam to her acceptance to Julliard, Mia's powerful story comes to life on each page.    Beautifully written and intense, If I Stay is one of the most amazing and unforgettable books I've ever read. Haunting and beautiful, yet inspirational, Mia's story will stay with you long after you finish reading it. One of my favorite reads of the year so far.
B0051YDTKS|5.0|O.k. I'm 37 years old and have listened to Ozzy Osbourne since I was in elementary school. I have listened to this album and many others for years. The vinyl recordings are going to be the best sound quality for sure. But in 1995 they [Epic records] remastered the entire Ozzy catalouge up to Ozzmosis. In 1995 Bob Ludwig remastered the albums for CD. At the time they sounded far better that the original cd pressings. poor, weak, muffled sound just like most first cd pressings. Now in 2011 we are getting another remastered recording and this blows away the 1995 remasters. Now hopefully Bark at the Moon and The Ultimate Sin will get the same treatment, maybe even No Rest for the Wicked and No More Tears, although they sounded fine on the 95 remasters. Get these two cds now, your ears will not be disappointed, mine weren't. Out Fools!!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I don't always play games on my Android phone, but when I do, I play Plants vs Zombies. And then I drink Dos Equis.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Glad its finally on android.  I've never played the other versions but this one runs very smoothly on Htc incredible.  Game is simple and addictive
B0052UZIFA|3.0|...the SLOWDOWN! as the levels get filled up with plants and zombies, the action is brought to a crawl. C'mon Popcap...My Galaxy runs some heavy Gameloft action smooth as a baby's butt so Plants and Zombies weak graphics shouldn't make it blink.  I wouldn't hesitate to get this. It's a fun game, it's balanced, it's got longevity, but it shouldn't also be annoying to play.
0312370849|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Sarah's key is a voice of 2 different women at 2 different times. Like so many of the other people who have written a review on here, I have to agree that I would have liked to heard more from Sarah. Towards the end a lot of the excitement I felt the first 173 pages kinda fell off. I would have liked it to started slower then had the excitment more towards the end. If I wrote a review before I had finished, it would have been 5 stars no doubt.    I  will keep this book on my shelf for many years. There is a lot of truth in this book and it draws you in to research more. I read it within 42 hrs. I still feel it was well worth my time and money.

B0028IDXDS|5.0|This was the only pacifier my daughter would take. I didn't like the way you could see her sucking on it so I bought one of these. It truly is the BEST! She holds on to the monkey while sucking on the pacifier which I think soothes her, and can even grab the monkey and bring it close to her to start to suck on. Also, it's so easy to find in my diaper bag or in her car seat while driving. I could never go back to just a regular pacifier!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is a Great game!  Works super on my Droid X.  I love it.  Thanks Amazon!  Give it a try you will love it.

The packaging and clarity of the colors brought out the 70's \\"vibe\\" to a tee. Led Zeppelin III Was an awesome album back in the day but with this perfect vinyl collector's disk it really will add years to the Zep legend.  Thank You, DDH
015603008X|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who had been wanting to reread it. The price was good and it shipped out quickly and arrived when anticipated. As far as the story goes, it's a classic novel that all should read.
B000J10ER4|5.0|Ok I am writing NOT about a product I have purchased yet a distributor that I purchased from his name is James K. Bradshaw or at least that is the name of said person I bought this movie from now all I will say is this guy is a LIAR I SPECIFICALLY ordered a BRAND NEW NEVER OPENED Dvd of Superman returns and what do I get? He bought it from BLOCKBUSTER it was USED AND towards the end of the movie it has a small section where it starts to skip for a few seconds. Now I didnt have the PATIENCE OR money to wait and send it back for him to give me a NEW one IF he would have given me a new one BUT when I SPECIFICALLY request a NEW dvd AND make it a point to check the NEW box I EXPECT a NEW dvd wouldnt YOU? Anyway THAT is the only MAJOR problem I have had so far using Amazon and I will CONTINUE to use Amazon for the foreseeable future

B0041KKYEM|5.0|So many people have dismissed the acting in this movie, and the characterizations, as one-sided, and have stated with assurance that they knew what was going to happen, that I must put my two cents' worth in. This movie is -- among other things -- a remarkable portrayal of narcissism in the flesh.    Narcissism, clinically defined, is the condition which makes the person act as if they are the only person of any importance in the world. Not only is she the center of the world, but she deserves to be there and anyone who does not recognize this and pay homage is simply too stupid to exist.     It's also a horribly painful way to live. We all have some degree of narcissism, but I don't know anyone who's ever felt that they are or were given all the positive attention they have ever wanted. Some psychologists say that while the major problem during Freud's time was neurosis, the corresponding problem today is narcissism. I think they're not far off.    Just a thought or two to chew on: what if we look at the movie with Nina and her mother as the main focus? It's clear that the mother is pushing Nina to fulfill the role she had wanted (and expected) for herself back in her youth, before her pregnancy with Nina forced her to stop dancing. Nina has been affected in such a way that she will do ANYTHING -- including some pretty overt self-destruction -- to make her mother love her. And it appears that no matter how beautifully she performs this role, she will not satisfy her mother; should she perform \\"perfect,\\" she will only incur her mother's wrath for bypassing her achievements.    The last words of the movie suggest some consideration of this angle. As she's dying, Nina says, \\"I felt it! I felt it!\\" and the director asks her what it is she felt. She answers, \\"Perfect!\\" and then dies, apparently in bliss. That's a question worth spending some time chewing on: what happened in the first 20-something years of this woman's life that she can finally be at peace ONLY when shewas performed a piece so perfectly that it necessitates her death.     Sad. And hardly superficial acting- or story-wise.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Plants vs. Zombies is an awesome game on every platform I've played it on, except this one. The download is too big, it uses too much memory, and it crashed my phone. Some of the graphics are crisp, but a lot of the graphics look blurry and muddy. This version also seems to not have any of the extras found in other versions. Overall this is a second rate port of a first rate game.
0857680986|5.0|I have copies that instructor's have given me and I've downloaded the PDFs. But nothing beats this book. The quality of the book is great. This book is a classic. I'm glad they've reprinted it.
B004EWFUQY|5.0|My family and best friends are on it.  We started in mid-May and the weight loss has been incredible.  Best yet is we can see how we will eat this healthy for the rest of our lives.  No cravings, no feeling of restriction or denial.  I highly recommend this to everyone.

B002NEFL8W|2.0|I wanted to love this grip, I really did. I shoot a lot of portraits, so I finally convinced myself three weeks ago to buy one. I bought it from a friend, who hadn't owned it for long and sold it to me a for a reasonable price.    When I first got the grip, I quickly learned how to connect it into my 7D, even though I found the wheel locking mechanism awkward. My first impression was that the grip was very large and not nearly as comfortable to hold as the normal grip. It has a similar rubberized coating as the body, which is nice, but the area where the grip protrudes is too shallow to allow my fingers to rest comfortably, and it is much more square than round. The shutter button feels springier and shoots much quicker than the normal shutter button. This took me a while to get used to. But after the first couple weeks, I appreciated the extra balance that the grip provided and loved the stability of the portrait orientation. It felt a little bulky and added some weight to the camera, but I got over it.    Then, a few days ago, after removing the grip and replacing it gently, I got a warning on the camera's LCD screen that read, \\"Camera cannot communicate with battery.\\" I fretted for an hour, restarting the camera, fully recharging the battery, searching Google for answers, etc. Finally, I found the culprit: a broken metal pin/connector where the grip inserts into the camera. Not one of the main pins, but rather the small silver connector beneath them. When I touched it with tweezers, it rattled and shook and was clearly dislodged from the plastic, somehow. I tried to replace it to its original position, but then it fell INTO the grip, where it is now lost.     The grip still works--it still provides power to the camera, but it cannot show the battery charge level; it just shows a blinking empty battery icon.     Will I be sending this to Canon's repair service? Probably not. In the past, it is has taken me months to get items repaired there (including my old 5D, which had ONE bent compact flash slot pin and cost $50 to be repaired), and I'm not going to spend the money to get a cheap metal piece put back in the grip. Yes, I'm upset that I spent a fair amount of money and it broke so quickly, but what can you expect from such a cheaply-made, mass-produced item? I enjoyed the grip, but now that I'm shooting without it, I actually like not having so much bulk and weight.     In any case, please be careful about connecting and disconnecting the grip from your camera, and seriously consider whether you need the extra bulk and weight.     Buyer beware.
B00005JKZV|4.0|This is one of the best movies of 2002.It is not quite as good as the 2001 original but it still lives up to it.All the original actors come back such as Eligah Wood Sean Astin Viggo Mortenson Orlando Bloom John Rites Davies Hugo Weaving and Ian Mckellen returning as The newly formed Gandalf the White also Christopher Lee returning as Saruman.Also new faces Such as David Wenningham Barnard Hill Mirenda Otto Brad Dorif with Karl Urban as Eomer and Andy Serkis as Gollum.The storyline is complex.The Acting is superb.The Action sequences were cool but a bit overbearing.The Visual effects are ledgendary.Overall this film is awsome much better than Star wars episode 2.
0439023483|5.0|I read this in ONE NIGHT.  I'm just starting Catching Fire and no time to review this.  But I think 5 stars says it all.  Great book!!!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I get a notification that I can get Plants vs. Zombies for free. I install Amazon's app in about a minute and when I go to download the game, it says I have to pay $2.99!  What kind of crap is that??
B004V9J3HM|5.0|Let's start off by getting something straight. You either like progressive rock with its numerous \\"widdly bits\\" and extended solos, or you don't. If you don't, look elsewhere. And you either enjoy Christian lyrics, tolerate them, ignore them, or are offended by them. And if you're offended by them, look elsewhere. As usual, Neal is not afraid to share that Jesus changed his life. After all, this is his \\"Testimony.\\"    Having gotten that out of the way, Neal has delivered another great slab of progressive rock that further cements his place as one of the top talents to ever emerge in the genre. Testimony 1 was new ground and risky, as Neal left his comfortable life with Spock's Beard behind to follow a calling he often questioned himself. After releasing a string of outstanding concept albums, he now returns to the story told back in 2003. For the most part, though, it's really more of a deeper look at the story already told, rather than a lot of new information further down the line of the narrative.    Neal is often accused of being to \\"samey\\" in his releases. Frankly, I find this kind of dumb criticism. An artist is who he is, and Neal doesn't sound like other artists to me. He's like the Christian rock version of Iron Maiden. You buy an album of theirs because  you want more of what you already know you like. When Maiden deviated from the plan and \\"evolved\\" with a new singer, it was a disaster. Their comeback was fueled by a return to the classic form that people knew and loved.    There are some new things in T2, despite it very comfortably fitting in the cannon of Neal's work. Randy George's bass work really stands out, and the bass is superior to that on T1. This is a very accessible listen, without being poppy. The hooks set in quickly and it doesn't require a lot of patience for it to settle. This is due to the strong melodies provided. At times, it's a little dirtier in the musical timbres. It has some nice glances back to T1, without over trotting on familiar ground. The guys of Spock's Beard contribute guest vocals on a track that features that Gentle Giantish acappella things that are so cool. Guest vocalist Matthew Ward adds some nice background highlights. Legendary guitar player Steve Morse makes a stellar appearance on Disc 2. Mike Portnoy is solid and consistent, perhaps even a little more tame than on some of Neal's previous work. \\"Tame\\" is a very relative term. I think the lyrics are stronger than on some of Neal's previous efforts, and overall, it's just a really fun listen.    Many are saying that \\"Seeds of Gold\\" from disc 2 is the best thing Neal's done. I can see how the case can be made.     One could do well to have their very first exposure to Neal Morse with this record. It's much stronger than the previous release, \\"Lifeline,\\" which had some very high highs but a few lackluster tracks.     T2 is emotional, spiritual, technical and phenomenal. Get it.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I loved this game on the PC, and it's surprisingly just as good on Android (Epic 4G)!  It did crash my whole phone the first time I used it, but not since, and it does take too long to reload the screen after the phone sleeps, which it does frequently if you have your screen time-out set low, so these are the only reasons I didn't rate it 5 stars.
B004G600A4|5.0|My kids and I have watched this no less than 20 times!  The storyline is cute, the songs stick in your head for days (but they're funny so it's not annoying).  Many laughs for both kids and adults!  All in all, well done Disney!  Love the banter between characters, amazing animation, and sososososososo funny!  Each person in our family gives this movie two thumbs way up!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!<br /><br />This is ridiculous. I'm through wasting my money on the versions of Star Wars I do not like. What if Di Vinci altered the Mona Lisa by taking away the famous smirk and replacing with a full blown smile with teeth. It wouldn't be the same. The altered trilogy is a crime against humanity and I wish all Star Wars fans would ban the Blu Ray versions until the ORIGINAL versions are captured in High Def.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|This app keeps force closing...i cannot get pay the hour glass despite reboots and battery pulls. Might work fire some but not ok my Droid X...
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works great on my Thunderbolt.  Played for two hours with no problem.  Glad to get it free, but well worth $2.99.
B003E6K1VK|5.0|I bought the E7 to use on my laptop at work.  It arrived yesterday and is working perfectly.  Plug and play. I use the Sennheiser HD448's which are very low ohms (32) and really don't need an amp.  I prefer the sound of headphones that are flat with little bass but there are times when you need to punch up the bass a little.  This amp works great and sounds great for that.  I also use the Bose in-ear earbuds.  It works great for them as well.  I am very pleased with the quality of the sound.
B0007O38XU|4.0|I have never seen a comedy that is worth watchiung for just one joke but I've got to tell you \\"Pizza The Hut\\" comes awfully close!
014241722X|3.0|Easy read and interesting story line but not a challenging read that we have some to expect from Grisham.  Fun book that is appropriate for all ages 10 and up but not one you would want to read again for a long time.
0307346617|4.0|Told in short little stories giving you insight 10 years after the war started.  Nicely done.  Tidbits of info given in early stories are later fleshed out in other stories helping to bring it all together as a book.  The book does end with a whimper and some ominous looks at what the future may hold for the post WWZ world.    Some original, to me, stuff here what with tactical and strategic responses, underwater threats. etc.  I had not read the survival guide prior to this but may now.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Fix it! Worked fine on 2.2, but freezes on 2.3  please fix it as I want to play!   Trying to get over twenty words more... Love the game, I just want it to work!
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I have an iPhone with an Otter Box Defender case.  This product makes it possible for me to use an iHome device while the Otter Box case is still on.  Please note, to prevent extra torque on the iPhone, I added an extra plastic brace to the iHome device so the iPhone can rest on the support when this adapter is used.  I brought the adapter and the iPhone with me when shopping in stores for an iPhone device to make sure all play nicely together.  Very good product, but you do need to consider that the adapter will raise the iPhone higher, and thus might need some extra support to prevent extra torque.  But for me it is a great product!!!!
0307946711|5.0|*SPOILER ALERT*     How I found this book? It's actually quite an interesting story. I was on IMDb.com looking at upcoming movies Anne Hathaway was starring in. I came across the upcoming film One Day and saw that it was an adaptation from a book, so I checked it out on Amazon and from then on was obsessed with it. I read this book in 2 days--well not exactly. I started reading the book while laying in bed on a Thursday night around 10 p.m. I stayed up until about 5 a.m realizing that I had to get ready for school, which would start at 8 a.m. Then the next night, I completed the book. My first impressions of the start of the book was that Dex and Em would eventually marry and live happily ever after, but when I finished the book I was genuinely shocked. I really enjoyed this book, so I contacted the author, David Nicholls, and we exchanged a few emails expressing how much I loved this book. I have not read other books written by Nicholls because I am a little skeptical on each of the story lines, but I will hopefully read them. Overall, I thought this book was beyond words with points in the story I found very spontaneous and lovely. Be Sure to read it, it is not something you want to miss.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|I bought this to use with my Samsung Vibrant Galaxy S phone, but it didn't work for me.  This had a generic camera tripod base you can buy for cheap almost anywhere.  The black plastic attachment for your cellphone had a hook on it you are supposed to pull back far enough to slide in your phone.  This may work for smaller cellphones, but my Vibrant was too big to slide in.  I was worried I'd damage my phone by forcing it into the attachment.    I ended up getting a different device.  The Dobi Design Ultra Compact Mini Tripod Stand worked better for me.  It has a big spring clamp with Rubber pads that held my Vibrant securily.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I really loved playing PvZ on my former iPod 3G, but caused by the change to Android my desire to play it has awakened again, but what does amazon? They have an America-exclusive App Store and also the rights to have this great game 14 days exclusively there?! I mean if amazon wants to make profit from selling apps there they should at least make it worldwide and not America-exclusive to gain more money and make all people happy(And the Euro is also more valuable than the US Dollar :)) Some hackers found a solution to play this also here in Germany in German :) so this is a really pointless action from amazon to prevent the other people to play this, because they already can. I will buy it in the Android Market, but I´m pretty disappointed from amazon, they could have done it better than they did.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I am sad. Wanted to play but I guess I'll have to wait until they Fix It For EVO!     ID10T
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Despite the claim in the descriptions, this game crashes to menu when ran on my Droid 2 Global. Does not work on most android phones from what I've read. I am surprised to see this low quality from Pop Cap Games.
0316044695|5.0|this account of modern-day warfare will give you some insight into the caliber of men fighting the wars of this country...they are volunteer warriors who seek little recognition for their daily sacrifices while we sleep warm in our beds at home, depending on them to keep us safe.  you will ask yourself after reading this book...\\"where do we get such brave men\\"?
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Yay! It's finally here lol. It's pretty good for the initial release version. Could use a little work but overall its awesome!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is very addicting and very fun. For $3 you can't really go wrong. I have a droid charge and it works great. It does reset my home screen when I close it, not sure why. Otherwise no complaints! Highly recommended!
B0041KKYEM|5.0|This was a movie I was fascinated with. I was confused a bit about the whole Natalie Portman scratching and seemingly to be growing feathers out of her. The dancing and bizarre twist is what I liked.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I downloaded during free trial and it has yet to open. if I uninstall, I'm stuck purchasing it. perhaps an update to come soon??
B004WJRJUE|4.0|The heavy metal band from the 80s Twisted Sister has re-issued their 1982 debut album 'Under The Blade'. It's digitally well remastered plus 4 never before released tracks from the Ruff Cutts EP, namely \\"What You Don't Know Can Hurt You\\" (marginally better than the album version), \\"Shoot 'Em Down\\" (great version, wonderful guitar & melody. Much better than the album version.), \\"Under The Blade\\" (great melodical guitar, again much better than the album version. The base track of this song sounds like that of U2's \\"Bullet The Blue Sky\\" which was released only later in 1987, so may be U2 was inspired by this track) & \\"Leader Of The Pack\\" (cover version of this 60s classic). There is also \\"Shoot 'Em Down(Live at Reading)\\" (a great live version, they can really play magnificently live!). The tracklisting used in this re-issue is the UK version (Twisted Sister was for practical purposes overshadowed by the legendary heavy metal band Kiss in the US & they 'felt they had more success' in UK & Europe, hence may be this preference). The bonus DVD has 1982 live at Reading concert (they really can have fun & entertain, great perfomances considering this was at their neophyte year. This material has never been released before plus some recent interview of this band). On overall, loyal fans of Twisted Sister now have the band's debut album remastered (UK tracklisting) plus 4 previously unreleased Ruff Cutts EP tracks & a bonus DVD of their performance at Reading in 1982, a must sought after collection by all Twisted Sister fans.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|1. When disabling music during gameplay, the setting is only saved for the level you are currently playing. After you complete a level, the game turns the gameplay music back on! You have to keep resetting every level! Please fix.<br /><br />2. Please update/improve graphics, especially the level complete animations. (The animation where you pick up a new item after defeating last zombie on each level)<br /><br />Positives:<br />Gameplay on my DroidX running Gingerbread 2.3.3 (4.5.596) ran smooth. NO lag. For anyone complaining about lag, point the finger at your Hardware manufacturer and NOT this game.<br />Did I mention this game is ADDICTING? If you didn't get it while it was free, make sure and buy this on sale!!!!!<br />Google Market could learn a thing or two from Amazon about user App Market experience.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Resisted for awhile, finally gave in, and now I don't know how I lived my life without this amazing game.
1433503794|5.0|I can't say enough about this volume.  Besides the obvious, it is God's Word presented in the ESV, the study resources contained therein are tremendous.  Things Christians need to know but normally have to go to many other places to find.  From an understanding of God's plan of salvation, to the canon, Bible doctrine, and how to read and interpret the Bible, this one book is an essential in the library of anyone wanting to know and apply truth to their lives.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Really love the whimsical style and soundtrack of the game. The zombies are really fun to fight and the gameplay is well crafted. Most importantly, it runs very smoothly on Android. HUGE app becomes very small if you install to sd.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|the game is great but it has very low resolution, use higher quality sprites man, other games have that, I'd be willing to wait longer for the larger file size to download, Samsung captivate
B004TTMYQG|4.0|Feature-rich option with functional UI. Not as pretty as the native app, but works much better, with a month view that's actually useful.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is by far one of the best app games to download!   You truly get your $'s worth, and if you have a decent phone, you won't be disappointed.   It rivals if not succeeds Angry Birds!  The Android Market just got left in the dust if you ask my opinion.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Even though you've most likely heard of this game before, it bears repeating that is as just as fun as everyone says it is. Definitely pay for ad-free version because the ads in the free version are obnoxious. Gameplay can be trial and error at first, but eventually you will be an expert at flinging birds at those obnoxious little pigs. Expect little pigs to appear in your dreams. This is one of those games that just burrows itself into your mind.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love it wow what a great game a+++ angry birds plants vs zombies is on your heels buy this game now
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums ever (by any band) and it was HUGE symbolically in the evolution of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as a band because they were on the brink of possibly breaking up and then John Frusciante re-joined the band making everything good again.    This album is brilliant and Frusciante uses a lot of the \\"less is more\\" idea in his playing. He especially utilizes this in the album Californication because he was still recovering from his drug addiction and his arms were still healing from the gangrene his arms had endured (somehow).     One could say the band was reborn with this album because of the return of Frusciante and I completely agree with this stance. The Chili Peppers have matured on this record and while keeping a few aspects of the sex/funk/ rock they were known for a decade earlier (Around the World, Purple Stain, Get on Top), they have a few more serene pieces such as the self titled track and Scar Tissue, the latter for which I will be forever grateful because it got me into what has been my favorite band for a while now.    This is easily one of the best albums of all time and while I mentioned a lot about Frusciante, the other members are on their game as well of course. I'm so glad I bought this album when it came out and it defined a pretty significant time period in my life. I can't say that about many albums!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|game is great on other platforms but they did a crappy job porting over the game to Android. the graphics look crappy in my HTC thunderbolt. a bit on the blurry side. they could have done better. save your money.
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|Good movie that deals with clairvoyance, near death experiences and three different stories that end up coming together. The cinematography is fantastic as well as a few intense action/disaster scenes. I would say out of all the Clint Eastwood directed movies this one is probably the least impressive but still decent and worth seeing. It still surpasses most of the mediocre films these days.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|A little pricey for a card reader, but did the job for us and our LX5 and Canon T2i.  You'll need to read up on how to get everything out of the ipad when complete, but my main requirement was to just get my photos onto the ipad immediately for viewing.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|It's a lot of fun to play.  If you need to waste some time and kill zombies...this is the game for you.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I've been waiting for this on Android for a while and I have no complaints about the game. I works just like it does on the ipod .
B0052UZIFA|5.0|awesome game. it works great on htc thunderbolt.  good load Times and it runs very smooth. especially nice when it's free.
B003274QH6|5.0|Forgot how much I loved the first season and watching it with other people who are only watching for the first time makes it hold up extremely well on re-watch.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|I bought this as a gift and as for my part I was happy with the delivery time as the dvd case look as promised.  As for the receiver she seemed happy to receive it.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|just like the iPhone app, except I don't see the guide for all of the different plants and zombies, I am addicted to this game though so I am thrilled its on Android finally
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Briliant game. I have been waiting for an android port before I got my android phone. Runs great on Epic 4G! This will be the 4th platform I have played this game on. Addictive, with just the right amount of gameplay depth.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|While there's a little lag between levels, this game plays just as well on my Evo 4G as on Iphone or PC. I got it for free but I would gladly pay in order to enjoy this game!
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I grew up in Montana, so naturally I grew up with Garth Brooks. Every radio station we got in the little town I lived in played country music exclusively, which means it was impossible not to hear Garth's songs almost every day. After being saturated day in and day out with country music, I don't listen to much of it anymore but I still love Garth Brooks.<br />Although I don't have this collection yet, it looks relatively complete & I look forward to listening to it soon.

B001BNFR6W|3.0|So I didn't see the other reviews saying how bad their copys of Will & Grace were and I bought it. I though it was my DVD player being cheap. NO it was the discs. I was mad becuase this is my favorite show in the whole world. I speant all that money on it and its sucks. NBC really needs to fix oh the discs are placed in the box set. All the discs have little scratches on them. Like I can still watch it but it freezes on me all the time. DON'T BUY IT. Try buying season by season.. Maybe that will be better.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I was excited for the game to come out.  The game is fun, but it looks like crap and is laggy in some sport on my dual core tablet.  Feels like they didn't put a lot of effort into the port.   It should be better than this.  To me it shows a lack of respect for the android community.      I got for free, so I suppose complaining is sort overboard, but I would have been happy to pay for a better job.
B000007491|5.0|This Album kicks ass, not what you think Supertramp is, you can tell Richard Palmer helped out with that Progessive feel. This album has the music feel of band's like King Crimson and genesis. Hell Yeah.
0345505387|5.0|I have read all of Ms. Gabaldon's Outlander books 7-8 times each, and was thrilled to have a story written from Jaime's perspective. It adds to the already wealth of detail that I find so riveting about all of these books. It now proudly sits next to my first edition copy of Outlander. Thank you Diana Gabaldon for the feast of imagery and, as always, a superbly written graphic novel!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this is the quality of game i consider a must for the industry.  it may not be the style of game people like, but it's pure quality, regardless.  heck of a freebie, thanks amazon.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|This game is an excellent way to kill time. Very funny concept for a tower defense game. My only problem is that the graphics are pretty lacking and I get lag when I beat a level and get the winning animation. Other than that, not bad. Droid X running Liberty 0.4.
B003VS0CXI|5.0|This is one of the classics. I drive my grown kids crazy with buying children's movies, but my son did admit this one was one of his favorites.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Tried on Archos 70, crashes  after loading. I would ask for a refund if it cost me anything. Angry Birds runs, why doesn't this?
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This version of Angry Birds follows the same classic gameplay that both the original game and \\"Seasons\\" both follow. The key difference is that you are no longer fighting pigs. Instead you free other birds, fight monkeys and search elusive golden rewards.    The most difficult part of this version of the game involves the monkeys. They have \\"intelligence\\" built into their character models so that they can regain their balance making it more difficult for the player to dispatch them.    A nice feature is that the levels have given dates for when you can expect an update to be released.    If you enjoy the original and \\"Seasons\\" this is more of the same, but it is a great way to pass the time when you find yourself in wait.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Graphics are great on my Evo Shift. Saved to SD card so it doesn't take up so much memory. It will make your phone hot if you play for a long time, but it's a great, addictive game. so happy to have it on my phone!
B0043X7WLA|4.0|Stevens has not made an easy work to access, but give it time and it grows on you. Individual songs stand out, but The Age of Adz really requires repeat plays from beginning to end. It's become a go-to album for my commute, and it shows artists are serious about making sure shuffle isn't the only way to listen to music anymore.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|It's quite a bit of fun, and a really well designed game that can keep you consumed for hours. I'm sure it will be a big hit if you like fun games.
1932100385|5.0|I actually read this book in the library and found the information so compelling that I wanted my own copy and decided to become a vegan. This book reads like a well written college textbook: very scientific with lots of documentation and gobs of information.  I bought a copy for my son and told my brother who was diagnosed with colon cancer last August about it. Before his diagnosis with stage 4 colon cancer after a routine colonoscopy he was considered one of the healthiest 61 year olds his doctors knew. Exercised regularly, correct weight and no health problems with yearly testing.  I expect this book will help him.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I guess it's true that you get what you pay for.  I'd be extremely pissed if I paid anything at all for this, since it doesn't even get past the loading screen on Archos tablet.  Don't waste your time.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I played this game on the iphone a couple of years ago and I'm so glad I found it on Android!   Very engaging game play.   Will keep you involved for hours! I highly recommend it!

B000660UN0|5.0|Every so often I'd hear a great blue-sy tune on the radio or tv, only to find out it's Clapton. I kept telling myself to check out his music, and I finally did so. This CD is a keeper. I think all that he's had to contend with in his life, has made this cd sound..so...righteous.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Fun game.   It works just fine on my Droid X so i wouldnt worry.  of couse mine might be an exception?  why a 20 word minimum????
B0052UZIFA|1.0|No wonder they waited so long to release it, its garbage!  The 50mb version that leaked a few weeks ago is superior to this copy (If you can get that one to run).  At least once per minute it would pause itself and reload like it was running out of memory on my rooted Droid X2 with all the bloatware removed.  Serious memory hog!  Really do not understand why they won't just port the flash version from the web since most Android devices can play flash games.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Received the product quickly and it arrived in the condition as described. I have purchased from this seller one other time and will purchase from this seller again if the opportunity arises.

B004A7UVLC|5.0|The second movie in the new Sherlock series was rollicking good fun.  The Blind Banker is a twisted little mystery with lots of players and lots of history.  Great fun to keep up with, and things keep changing at a rapid pace.<br /><br />We get to see a little more of Sherlock's history in this one.  I loved the exchange he had with the banker/old friend that hires him to investigate some vandalism in the bank that wasn't theft related.  The spray-painted clues were timely and well presented.  The title is somewhat misleading, though, because it only comes from a picture that holds part of the message.  The picture has a man whose eyes have been painted over.  Still, the title is definitely intriguing.<br /><br />The mystery is well put together and unfolds on several levels at once.  All the pieces interlock and it all makes sense.  My wife and I were able to stay ahead of some of the curves, but it was only just a step or two.  There was no telegraphing in this story.<br /><br />The Chinese element of the story was well done.  I liked the bits and pieces of history that are woven into the story, and the acrobats were interesting and whetted the appetite for more.<br /><br />John Watson also gets a girlfriend in this story, and that plays into the Sherlock Holmes canon because Watson was supposed to be a ladies' man.  However, Sarah (Zoe Telford) gets a first date that's way more exciting and dangerous than she'd ever imagined.  She's still around in the third movie, so it will be interesting if she becomes a part of the series.  She'd be a breath of fresh air when in the company of Mrs. Hudson and Sgt. Sally Donovan, the first who seems somewhat dotty and the second who seems overly abrasive and dense.<br /><br />I did feel somewhat miffed because the ball was dropped regarding Watson's apprehension for graffiti.  There was considerable mention of him having to go to court, but we never get to see the resolution of that.<br /><br />The multiple mysteries - what was going on and why the people were killed as well as where the missing item was - are fun and a mystery enthusiast can put it all together just before Sherlock reveals everything.  Benedict Cumberbatch (Sherlock) and Martin Freeman (Watson) continue to amaze in their respective roles.ll as where the missing item was - are fun and a mystery enthusiast can put it all together just before Sherlock reveals everything.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I first played this game on an iPad at the apple store and couldn't wait for it to come out for android. It runs without a stutter on my droid 2. No bugs or crashes noted so far. The game has tons of unlockables that change your strategies and keeps the game from getting dull. I definitely recommend getting this app as it is certainly on the shortlist for best android game to date.
B00499K9E0|5.0|I'd heard of the new Sherlock series released by the Masterpiece Theater in October 2010, and I'd been really interested.  I'd grown up reading Sherlock Holmes stories and imagining the Great Detective and Dr. John Watson plunging through the fog-shrouded streets of 19th century London, and I'd enjoyed Jeremy Brett's interpretation of the character.  I also love Robert Downey, Jr's, portrayal of Holmes and am anxiously waiting for the second movie in that series.<br /><br />This Sherlock is a bit different, though.  It is set in present day London, and Watson is a survivor of the Afghanistan War (it's interesting to note that back in 1887 when the first Holmes novel came out - A Study in Scarlet - Watson was a veteran of the Afghan wars then too).  As a kid, I'd seen Sherlock Holmes transported to the future in The Return of Sherlock Holmes and in Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century (an animated series).  I wasn't sure how this series would work out.<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch (as Sherlock Holmes) and Martin Freeman (as Dr. Watson) totally won me over, though.  They've got chemistry between them that lights up the screen.  The murder is loosely based on the first Sherlock Holmes novel but it plays out quite nicely in this 90-minute movie.<br /><br />Watson, always the more human of the duo, is an intriguing character and I can't wait to see what they do with him.  Martin Freeman is excellent in this role.  However, Freeman is also on tap to play Bilbo Baggins in the two Hobbit movies, so his time is undoubtedly going to be precious.  Thankfully there are six episodes of this series (three haven't yet aired) that will be available.<br /><br />Cumberbatch is a wonderful Holmes.  Quirky and energetic and a pleasure to watch even while he's lying on a couch pondering problem (the pipes have been replaced with nicotine patches), Cumberbatch delivers the Holmes fans expect, but he gives them something extra.<br /><br />I loved the sequence of Holmes and Watson racing across the rooftops as they tried to intercept a suspicious taxi.  I'm glad that the series seems to be equally adept outside a flat as it is inside one.  I'd wondered if we were going to be stuck on sound stages.<br /><br />The series also builds on the Holmes myth.  We get to see Holmes's brother, Mycroft, and there's mention of Moriarty, so that bad boy is coming.tercept a suspicious taxi.

0316044695|5.0|\\"Lone Survivor\\" is a non-fiction book about the courage and strength that soldiers need in order to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan. The book is very captivating and interesting in most parts, however sometimes it gets a little repetitive. Even with this repetitiveness I couldn't stop reading it. It's as if I was in Afghanistan fighting with the navy seals.   I got a little annoyed at the beginning of the book when the main character, Marcus Luttrell, is in training camp. I definitely got bored at this point. But, when Marcus and his squad go on a very important mission to take out an important Taliban target the story gets very interesting. There is a lot of action and shooting... and gore during these firefight scenes. I would definitely recommend this book to any action addict or somebody that wants to read something that is extremely awesome. This book was one of the best I have ever read.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Installed to SD card with no problems.  Only takes under 1 mb of internal storage which is better than lots of games.   Takes a little while to open but seems to work fine in the game so far once it loads
B0052UZIFA|5.0|As a hardcore Ios Plants versus Zombies player, I really hated leaving my old 3G IPhone behind for this Samsung Fascinate. No PvZ! Fixed by Amazon and Popcap and free out of the gate. Haven't run it yet. It's PvZ. I was playing it on an 8g IPhone 3rd gen before. If it's not at least that good it would be pretty odd.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Does not work on Nexus S.. .a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is why companies dont give stuff away for free. I've played it, without slowdowns, crashes or freezes. It looks just as good as it does on the ipod / Iphone. The issue with android fragmentation is not Pop Caps fault. Have an isssue with your phone not being able to play this or netflix (which the original droid can but not my droid X) call Google or switch to Apple on your next contract renewal.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I like the fact that this game is free today but I'm kind of mad that I actually went out to buy this on my iPhone 4. I should've just waited but in the end it is kind of worth it because I got it on a whole different device running a whole different OS. I like how smooth it runs on a dual core phone but a WiFi download is really not necessary.    In the end it is a very good game, very fun to play in school(counting the fact that it's nearly over [:). If you haven;t gotten this game today and any other day then I would say it's just your luck but it's a definent buy.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Great Product. Plug and play for me and my application I was using. Pin pointed my location indoors in 10 seconds.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Fun, even though I hate tower defenses. Would be great if instructions were better. Also eats battery. Still love it.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Game freezes after a few seconds after the initial loading screen. The graphics are blurry on the tablet as well. Definitely not a HD version.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|It is a bit laggy on my iconia honeycomb tablet.   Game play is responsive but when you get a new item it is jumpy. Overall amazing game and glad it's on android :)
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I am really disappointed with this game because I chose to uninstall the app store from my Evo 4G and the game will no longer play. Amazon, unless you fix it you just lost a lifelong media buyer.

B0041KKYEM|1.0|If you're looking for lesbian sex between two known actors, then this film has what you want.  If you're looking for a good film, look elsewhere.  The story fails to explain anything relevant other than to suggest that to dance well, ballerinas need to have an orgasm.  To be fair, this is the symbol of Natalie's frustrations and struggle to rise above being a child and become an adult but to also be fair, its hard to see the point.  The psychotic elements are typical and don't follow much of a theme and the overall script is purely abysmal.    Further, the actual dancing is minimal, especially considering it is supposed to be a key part of the storyline.      My suggestion is that if you want porn, buy real porn.  Otherwise, recognize that the best part of the film is Natalie's eye makeup in the end.
B002ZG981E|1.0|The movie is not at issue here. The movie is great, a classic piece of science fiction.    What is at issue here is the quality of Warner Brothers DVD mastering and transfers.     They are the worst. There must be something they are trying to create that is in the form of copy protection for the DVD. The result? The DVD moves in and out at a constant rate, pixelated, digitized and awful looking. This is the same company who's bright idea is to sell people DVD-Rs for $25 for movies they don't want to produce on a regular basis.     This is easily the worst picture quality I have ever seen in a DVD. It is disgusting. I noticed it and was kind of annoyed, first on this DVD. Then I noticed it on \\"Going the Distance\\" also on Warner Home Video and the pieces began to fall into place.     I am certainly going to call Warner Home Video on this matter and will not buy another Warner DVD until this is resolved. Warner, to me has always had a bad reputation for making crummy DVDs, with high failure rates in Mexico, and this occurrence is the straw that broke the camel's back for me.    Warner has sunk to a new low. Selling defective DVDs right out of the box, that become defective in short succession, selling DVD-Rs for more than full price...now...they are selling DVDs with unacceptable quality picture.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|that's about All i have to say about it.  it is an amazing game and very very very addicting. i like playing at night Moreso than the day and I'm not a huge fan of having to waste seed slots on Lily pads but, aside from that is awesome.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Loved it, loved it, loved it. Couldn't put it down. I was sorely disappointed when I finished it because there was no more. I've pre-ordered the next one and cannot wait to download it!     If you like/love Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden, then this series is for you! The protagonist, Atticus O'Sullivan, has all the wit and snark as Harry. He even has all the dumb, blind and bad luck of Dresden. There are vampires and werewolves who are actually Atticus's lawyers and yes, they manage to work together.     Great Urban Fantasy without all the \\"fluff\\" that most of the genre has. Just true, down to earth and gritty, like \\"fantasy\\" should be.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I could not get it to work at all. Typing in my name was as far as I got. The buttons were very difficult to press, and it wouldn't start a game. Uninstall.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Could not install due to memory managment, with a 95mb download which is almost half the total 250mb memory of the 'Pandigital Novel\\" and then even after clearing space would not install, too bad it could not be downloaded and installed via USB so that a PC/MAC would do all the decompression of the 'APK' file.
B004SBQAN8|3.0|In a nutshell...Number Four is fourth in a series of nine aliens who have fled to earth to escape but now there are only six aliens (Loriens).  Number 3 gets killed early on and Number Four a.k.a John Smith is made instantly aware due to a brutal brand that appears on his leg (oh...this happens during a night of wild partying on the beach).  Apparently, all Loriens receive the brand as the others are killed in numerical order.  Now come the \\"killers\\" the alien hunters or Mogadorians.  Okay...stick with me here...since the killings are sequential, #4(Alex Pettyfer) knows he's next, so with his protector, Henri (Timothy Olyphant), they instantly pack up and take off, burning every souvenir, photo, even the license plate off their car which...duh...is metal, so of course there's that tiny scrap of evidence that will lead the Mogadorians right to them.    Confused?  So was I.  There was a Gecko that snuck into Henri's bag and then turned into an adorable puppy when they reached Paradise, Ohio and we hear the words every parent dreads, \\"Can I keep him?\\"  Henri, for all his Yoda-ish knowledge, of course has no idea that the puppy is some sort of alien.  We know it's not a Gecko and we know it's not a puppy...but what the heck IS it?  Okay...still with me?...John decides the second he sets foot in their new house that he's bored (whine) and wants to go to school.  Henri reminds him to blend in, not stick out, not give any clues to help the Mogadorians find him.  Day one at high school is a nightmare of bullying in the First Degree.  Why on God's green earth would a kid, who recently narrowly escaped with his life, knowing he's some sort of \\"chosen one,\\" and going through major teenage angst WANT to go to school...and, after meeting the butt-head, big man on campus, WANT to go back?  I think that may have been something they covered in the book...but got left on the cutting room floor.  The whole time people are being slammed into lockers, having their locker explode with red goop, you know...typical bullying stuff, I'm thinking, \\"Just LEAVE.\\"  But...ah-ah-ah...the allure of school and the daily humiliation is Sarah (Dianna Agron)...who, wait for it, is the ex-girlfriend of the Head Bully.    This movie had so many clichés (OF COURSE Loriens only fall in love once in their lives and that just so happens...wonder of wonders...to be our heroine) and confusing plot lines (why were the evil aliens chasing our Number 4?).  I just never got into it.  Fortunately, Number 6 (Teresa Palmer) shows up and then there's some pretty good fight scenes that liven things up.  But, if you took any really cheesy romance/alien/teenage angst movie and combined it, you would have \\"I am Number Four.\\"      I think that the only redeeming value of this movie was the very end with the fight scenes (enter cute puppy alien who actually is one of the good guys).  Those were entertaining and almost helped make up for the other hour and a half of boredom.  They did hint at a sequel...after all, here was Number 6...he was Number 4...all that's missing is Number 5 and 7 through 9.  But please, dear Touchstone, hear my plea.  Let \\"I Am Number 4\\" be the last...unless you want to do something wild and crazy and make an ORIGINAL film that is fun from start to finish.    My advice?  Wait for it to come out on HBO or regular t.v. and learn from my mistake...don't waste your money.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I can't put this game down! It starts off easy but definitely gets harder. Super fun and I think it's one of the best games on android. Sure it may not be for everyone but I definitely think everyone should check it out.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|Ever since I have heard \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\", I fell in love with this band. They are not a flash in the pan or a one hit wonder. The band is headed by Mark Foster whose musical genuis shines in ever song on Torches. Torches provides an eclectic look at who Foster the People is musically. It is interesting that there are no pictures of the band on Torches, however I feel that they want to have their music stand on its own. My favorite songs on Torches are \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\", \\"Houdini\\", \\"Helena Beat\\", \\"Don't Stop\\" and \\"Waste\\". With only ten songs on Torches, it is just the right amount of music to have the fans love the current work, but also crave for more. Foster the People is hear to stay.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I loved this game on, my laptop. Now on my galaxy s its everything I dreamed and more. I would recommend this.

This gun jams often and some times destroys my darts.  The scope is way off. If you aim at some ones head the dart will go over.  I like the scope on there becouse it gives the sniper detail.  It feels like a real sniper and has great grip.  It shoots far but some times it only shoots a couple feet.        Great gun
B0041IT1HA|5.0|I'll try to keep this brief; just a few lines.  I usually don't write reviews, although I buy products on Amazon all the time.  I felt, however, that I needed to write one for this set.  Maria Lettberg's playing is superb in both musicality and technicality.  A perfect example is her performance of Op. 8 No. 12.  She executes the etude technically well, but also plays it with a fiery passion surpassed only by Horowitz and Hamelin. Every piece in the entire box set is played at the least very well, and many pieces (mostly later Scriabin, especially preludes) surpass  any other recording I've found.  Ms. Lettberg obviously put a tremendous amount of time into this set, and it shows.  Not only is the set complete, save posthumous works, but each individual recording shines by itself.  Highly recommended.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Great fun, addicting game.  All the praises are warranted.  I knocked off 2 stars because the game just drains my battery to the point of not being able to play for more than a half hour from a full charge.  Along with that, the battery gets HOT.  Also, when exiting, it will restart HTC Sense (could be my ROM tho.).  HTC Evo 4G btw.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|The fact that amazon would make an application that is unusable on two versions of DROIDS but not the original Droid is simply a let-down. After downloading the Amazon App Store application and getting my hopes up on playing Plants vs. Zombies, I soon find out that I am unable to enjoy the experience.<br /><br />This is a rip-off and a let down. Amazon, you have disappointed me, and I will not soon forget it. At least make sure your beloved apps are compatible with all or none; it is unfair to advertise a free application and/or game that at least HUNDREDS of users cannot play, causing them to be punished because they were the original consumers that helped make the Android phones what they are now.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />A Disappointed User

B004X0Y5GI|1.0|Stevie where did you go? I listened to this new album today and was shocked.  No harmony, no electric guitar, mellow sounds, no stories...........- Not what I expected.  With the possible exception of track 3, the entire album falls short of my expectations of Stevie, after following her for 30 years.  Where is the excitement and passion?  What about the instrumental and vocal harmony of her past albums?  It seems gone.  Maybe Stevie's age is catching up with her.  As a member of the Woodstock Nation, we have joined society and have successful paying jobs, but our passion for change and expression have never died.  I think Stevie has.    Aurora, OH

0743497465|4.0|This story has a lot of great plot twists, which Dan Brown is great at. Unfortunately, I read this after Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons and Digital Fortress. I see the exact same situations in all the books. I don't want to spoil the book, if you haven't caught on to the cookie cutter story telling of this writer, it's a great book. Which is why I rated it a 4. But if you have read other Dan Brown books and began to see a pattern. Well there is one. I am aware this book was written before the other books, but I would write the same review for any of his books. Alone, they are easily 4's, Angels and Demons I'd give a 5. But after a while the pattern emerges. And then it becomes too predictable.
0061537969|5.0|Quick, easy, and emotional read. I'm an avid reader and our May 2011 book club selection was this novel. I am an animal lover, so I expected to enjoy this book... little did i know I would read it, cover to cover, in less than 24 hours. Garth does an amazing job of making you FEEL - happy, sad, angry...everything.<br /><br />This is a book that can be enjoyed by adults as well as young-adults (children can, but some of the language/subject matter isn't appropriate).
0812550706|5.0|I have reread this book at least once a year from my first time in 8th grade to now, 21 and still as big of a fan as back then.
B004K4AUZW|3.0|Before all you \\"little monsters\\" come to her defense, let me preface by saying I think that Gaga is a VERY talented person who puts out a very positive message. Be who you are, not what someone else wants you to be. Now, onto the latest edition to the collection, \\"Born This Way.\\"    I was very excited to get this album, but after the release of the \\"Born This Way\\" single, I thought to myself \\"Uh oh!!\\" Not a big fan personally, and it has NOTHING to do with the whole Madonna sound-alike story either. It depends on what Gaga songs you like as to whether or not you will like this CD. I personally LOVED her first CD and Fame Monster, but this one doesn't pack the same PUNCH like her first CD. The songs are too artsy to me, and some are quite simply annoying. It just doesn't have the same catchy, dancy feel to it. Here is how I see it. If you went to a bar or a club two years ago and Poker Face or Just Dance came on the speakers, even if you didn't like Gaga you were bobbing your head. I thought those songs were brilliant and I truly thought she was on her way towards 2 decades of success, and dare I say be the modern day Madonna or Michael Jackson... To me personally, none of these tracks have that quality to them, so in my humble opinion I think that this was a slight step back for her. Don't get me wrong, she isn't going anywhere anytime soon, but I think she needs to incorporate what made her so successful from the first CD instead of trying so hard to deliever a message in all of her songs in a non-exciting way.
1400052181|4.0|The research for my Honours degree in Cell Biology relied largely on cell culture. I have a passion for this field and I had heard of HeLa (pronounced hee-lah) cells and some of the work done with them. But I had never heard about their origin and history, so when I saw The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks I knew it was a book I had to read.<br /><br />What often puts me off about books dealing with science is that they can be quite flat and lifeless. I am happy to report that this was not the case with The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. The facts are there, but Rebecca Skloot has managed to present the very human face of Henrietta, her family and the scientists who are a part of her story. The book is well structured and reads like a novel. It drew me in to the story.<br /><br />HeLa cells are extraordinary. They thrive in a tissue culture environment and have allowed researchers to make huge strides in numerous fields - from tissue culture itself, through gene mapping and cancer research to the development of life-saving drugs like the polio vaccine. These cancer cells, taken from a tumour on Henrietta's cervix, are a marvel. It has been estimated that in the fifty years since they were first cultured that more than fifty million metric tons of HeLa cells have been grown in laboratories around the world. To give you an idea of scale - if these HeLa cells were laid end-to-end they would wrap around the world at least three times. But what about the woman who made all of this possible?<br /><br />Using records and interviews with family members Skloot has managed to bring Henrietta Lacks to life. Her story and that of her family plays a large part in The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. There is a very human side to this book that was interesting to read. Skloot puts the times and actions of the various family members and researchers into a context that gives the reader perspective. But she doesn't shy away from the ethical questions raised by Henrietta's story.<br /><br />The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a science book about people. Rebecca Skloot has done a great job weaving the strands of fact into a story that will make you think.Henrietta Lacks is a science book about people. Rebecca Skloot has done a great job weaving the strands of fact into a story that will make you think.

B00000I41J|5.0|There are no words for a good review. Words like 'beauty', 'magnificent', 'fantastic', 'briljant'... you could use all of them and then still miss what this album reflects: extraordinary musicians who make extraordinary good music with a solid melody and rhythm, with feel, swing, suspense... From the first bar on you will be taken to a studio where a group of musicians sits in for a session of world class jazz! They make you feel like you are there and part of their performance. And what a performance!!! They all play their hearts out and take you through a world of emotions like you never experienced before and probably never experience again!    There are hundreds of excellent albums made. Only a few can be called 'extraordinary world class excellence'. This album goes even beyond that...

B000QCS8TW|1.0|After all the hype online and on TV with the new series, I was really looking forward to this book. However, I found it tedious and boring. There are intriguing chapters, but the plot was fairly predictable before I was halfway done.  Too many characters lead to underdeveloped characters.  Yes, girls did get married at 13, but reading some of these scenes felt....dirty even if it may have been historically accurate.  The gap b/t the young playing at war and the adults living through it was too large a gap to bridge for me.  Knowing the story continues on and on through more books made me tired just thinking of it.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is such a fun game. Get your sun plants ready! Because, it is time to kill some zombies. When I first heard of this game, I thought it sounded rather dumb. That was until I played it. It is so much fun.

B004NK3MN0|4.0|The Submarine EP from Arctic Monkeys' frontman Alex Turner is a very strong and wholly enjoyable release that is certainly worth checking out if you have an interest in either the artist or indeed the film.<br /><br />The EP is short and sweet, with no fat or unnecessary padding and Alex's usual standard of lyrical excellence is present and correct, making the EP worth investigating for that alone anyway.<br />There are no complaints to be made on the production or performance fronts and the quality of songwriting is fairly high all around.<br /><br />To summarize; This collection of lyrically interesting, mostly acoustic numbers is a welcome addition to anyone's music collection
B0052UZIFA|5.0|been hooked on plants vs zombies since I got it on steam. now I can enjoy it on my phone.
B004QMRHHW|5.0|Amon Amarth have been on an upward trend over the last few studio albums, rising from relative unkowns to cult heroes to a genuine big deal, especially with the previous two albums which launched the band into the wider public consciousness and resultantly lead this album to be one of metal's most anticipated albums in years.<br /><br />The band do not disappoint and deliver more of their trademark Norse themed, twin guitar melodic death metal from the beginning of the album to the end. The songs are as catchy yet savage as ever, the musicianship is phenomenal (especially guitar solos) and the production job is top notch making the album sound absolutely fantastic on all levels.<br /><br />Whether you enjoy the album or not will depend largely on whether you have had enough of the Amon Amarth formula, this album presents no large shift in musical direction and no abandoning of the lyrical or vocal styles associated with the band up until this point and what you get is essentially another Amon Amarth record along the same lines as the previous two, with all the technical and songwriting progress the band had made until that point.<br /><br />Should you have tired of this forumla then by all means, feel free to give Surtur Rising a miss, but if you haven't then this album is something you will want to be getting in on as soon as possible.<br /><br />Opener 'War Of The Gods,' and the fast and dramatic 'A Beast Am I' are easily among the best songs the band have released in recent years, and the album draws to a close with the grand and melodic 'Doom Over Dead Men,' which distills perfectly everything Amon Amarth have come to represent.<br /><br />In summary if you want a flawless sounding, perfectly executed Amon Amarth record, with great songs, great musicianship and the trademark Amon Amarth sound then Surtur Rising will not disappoint.

B000002IPZ|4.0|1990's Souls Of Black is a truly enjoyable album from the bay area thrash band Testament. The album features fan favourite semi-ballad 'The Legacy,' and the famous title track 'Souls Of Black,' so right from the get-go you know that this album is worth your time.<br /><br />Sometimes this album is overshadowed by the reputation of the band's previous three albums The Legacy, The New Order and Practice What You Preach, all of which are undeniable classic albums of the highest order, but if you enjoyed those records then you will surly enjoy Souls Of Black as well, continuing the melodic yet heavy thrash style from the Practice What You Preach album.<br /><br />Opening, as all the best thrash albums do, with a short acoustic guitar intro into an out and out thrash number the album gets going to a strong start, with the very catchy 'Face In The Sky.'<br />From that point on the album never dips in quality, with songs like 'Love To Hate,' and 'One Man's Fate,' being as good as anything you'd expect from Testament.<br /><br />Each area of the album is of the highest quality; the music is strong, the lyrics are strong and the production is strong.<br /><br />In summary, don't miss out on Testament's incredible fourth studio album, critical claims that it sounds rushed just don't hold up against a fair and educated listen. If you like thrash, especially bay area thrash and especially by Testament, then Souls Of Black is an album you want to be listening to.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|If you've played the 360 or PC versions of this game you should know what to expect. Great port for android.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|Trying to install it on Xperia x10a, Amazon says it's compatible but after downloading it my phone tells me it is out of space and for me to free up space.

1439102724|4.0|I've read several of Ms. Picoult's novels and have been greatly impressed by her ability to create characters that are complex, believable, and sympathetic.  In \\"Sing you Home,\\" the three main characters are quite complex persons whom you come to care very deeply about, and you can't wait to find out what's going to happen to them.  Ms. Picoult's ability to combine a complex plot and remarkably well written dialogue with controversial and difficult ethical and legal issues makes her, in my opinion, one of our country's most gifted contemporary novelists.  As a lawyer, I particuarly enjoyed the take-no-prisoners, extremely entertaining court-room drama that comprises much of the last half of the novel. And, as always, Ms. Picoult has done her homework.  The book gives the reader interesting insights into such diverse topics as in-vitro fertilization, music therapy, the role of genetics and environment regarding sexual orientation, and the legal technicalities of same-sex relationships.  Ms. Picoult knows her stuff and writes authoritatively when these topics appear in her novel.  I learned a lot reading \\"Sing You Home,\\" and, I believe, am a better person for the experience--more compassionate and less inclined to judge difficult issues too quickly without knowing enough of the facts and evidence.  Along the way, \\"Sing You Home\\" made me tear up on several occasions, but it also made me laugh out loud many, many times.  Indeed of her many gifts as a writer, Picoult's ability to skillfully blend heartbreaking passages with passages that make you laugh out loud might be her greatest talent.  Anyway, if you care about people and you love a great story, buy this book and enjoy!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I had heard of Plants vs. Zombies before but never tried the game out until it came out for Android.  It's a desktop tower defense style game but it offers up enough new features to make it stand out.  The graphics and sound effects are great and really add to the experience.<br /><br />The first few levels act as a tutorial explaining how to use the plants to fend off the zombies from your home.  At the end of each of the beginning levels you win new plants that can be used in future levels to protect your home.  I've only played the first 10 levels, but have already come across 4 different types of zombies, some fast, some slow, and some armored.  I've also come across 2 different types of game play.  There is the normal desktop tower defense style and bowling which allows you to send nuts rolling down 'alleys' to take out zombies.<br /><br />Overall this game is well worth the price of admission.

I dont feel I can do Marcus or this book justice trying to review it.  Just trust me, GET THIS BOOK and read it!  I have read like hundreds of books, and this is in my top 5.  I am a 40ish *sigh* conservative, civilian female.  I am trying to get the \\"real\\" scoop of the war and what our troops are going thru from first hand people.  NOT THE MEDIA.... puhleeeez!

B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great color, sound, and playability on the Charge. Loads a little slow. Overall great port. Very fun and funny. I've played this on the computer and was a little worried about a droid version but it works great!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Its a great game but not for my ASUS tablet. Everything is stretched and looks horrible. I just hope this gets updated for tablets.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|For some reason it doesnt want to open, it just goes to the hourglass symbol then crashes which is disapointing because i like the game i have it on my pc and i wanted this for when im on the go
B0052UZIFA|3.0|on nook is sluggish. the sound effects are awful. the game pace is slow and complicated. for such a big memory you'd expect something better.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|I heard about this book in a tech podcast I usually listen to, so I downloaded the sample. That was Saturday night. After reading the sample I had to buy the book and keep reading, If It wasn't because of other activities I had to do I would have finished Sunday night, but it took me until Tuesday night!. I'm sad it ended. Excellent novel. Nice surprise.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I have to confess that for most part of the book I was entertained, it was a good story that was easy to read.  But the end of the book is just lame, really this book could easily be 10% shorter.  The story is simple, nothing too fancy or elaborated but it was good.  But at the end everything goes to hell...
B0052UZIFA|5.0|The only thing close to a flaw I can see is that the initial load time can be pretty long sometimes.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|My Phone:  Samsung Vibrant Galaxy S<br /><br />I honestly didn't expect the Android port of the PC game to be so high quality!  Aside from the seed-selection bar being changed from a horizontal position at the top of the screen, to a vertical position on the left, the game actually looks nearly identical to the PC version.  I honestly wasn't expecting the sprites to be of so high a resolution; nor, did I think it'd have the game's actual sound effects and accompanying music. I've played previous phone adaptations of PC titles and had grown accustomed to dumbed down, mediocre ports that only share a resemblance to their full-featured counterpart, having to cater to the lowest common denominator of Android phones, such as the launch Android phones, the Motorola Droid, but instead Popcap just excluded that phone entirely so they wouldn't be limited by it.<br /><br />Pros:  Runs great, faithful adaptation of the PC version, full music/sound effects and impressively high-resolution graphics<br /><br />Cons:  None yet!  Haven't had any crashes, glitches slowdown or errors.<br /><br />The rating for this game would be a lot higher if it wasn't brought down by complainers using the game's rating as a means to moan about their non-standard resolution phones, personal lack of WIFI access, or their questionable choice to install beta, user created ROMs with stability issues.  Just add two stars to Plants Vs. Zombies rating when considering it's actual average rating, and you'll have a more better idea of what to expect from the game's actual fun/quality, provided you have a decent phone.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|I had the privilege of watching the movie Sucker Punch, directed by Zack Snyder, and I use the word privilege specifically. I don't know that this movie was actually made for me.<br /><br />Sucker Punch is a movie that many have critically drubbed, to the point of labeling it varying degrees of schlock at best, and a video game movie at worst. What critics don't seem to realize about that last charge, of calling it a video game, is that the video gameish aspects of it are in fact a conscious and well wrought choice on the director's part. Sucker Punch is a movie about multiple layers of perception, of imagination, and of fantasy used to mask the very dark and sometimes inconceivable horrors that befall the powerless. This is a movie about the powerless finding power where they can in order to shape their own destinies. This is also a movie about making hard choices and doing what you need to in order to cope. These are nuances lost on a great many critics.<br /><br />There are two, maybe even three levels of fantasy working at any given time of this movie. I say maybe three, because I'm not completely convinced that the asylum itself, with its own stylized version of a 1930s pulp story of institutionalization doesn't also constitute some fantastic version of an actual reality. The three layers we're privy to in the movie are the institution, which sandwiches or frames the narrative, the brothel/dancehall, and the video gamey action sequences. Each layer of fantasy is one more layer of protection for the main characters of the story, a layer of lies they tell to get themselves through the rather raw and painful reality of their lives. Had the director peeled those layers back completely, one would of have seen exploitation of the powerless at its most absolutely visceral.<br /><br />So how do these layers work? The institutional layer is the closest to an objective reality. This is merely a funhouse reflection of the world in which these girls find themselves. In this world Baby Doll was almost attacked by her evil step father, and her sister killed before an attack could occur. I wonder if closer viewings might not support a reading of crisis not averted. In this world Rocket was merely thrown into the institution, and her sister followed. Rocket's style and dress, even her haircut and instant crush on Baby Doll suggests she was institutionalized for her unspoken but present sexuality. Again, these things are merely a superficial spackling that vaguely romanticize the institution.<br /><br />The second layer is the combination brothel/dancehall where the girls are trained in the art of dance, where dance is as thinly veiled a metaphor for sex as one can possibly get without a pole and a feather boa. This layer, more than the first, shows signs of conforming to the girls' perspective of the world. In this version of the world, the orderly is the boss and has all the power, whereas the kind and compassionate doctor of the institution is more Madame/mother figure who finds herself subordinate to the boss, mostly by dint of her gender. As we discover near the end of this movie, the power dynamics between the boss/madame actually belie the real dynamics between the orderly/doctor, when the doctor asserts authority over the orderly that the madame never has. This act, which would have been a usurpation of power in the brothel world, suggests that the power dynamics are, as previously stated, based solely on the girls' read of the situation.<br /><br />The third layer is the most problematical for critics and the one that makes most sense after an objective review. Again, I call this the video game layer. This is the layer that the girls retreat to when they engage in \\"the dance.\\" In this layer girls have complete power over their environments. They are superheroes, batted around, beaten and bruised, but for the most part (and until fantasies start to bleed into each other) indestructible. There is a reason video games are a popularform of entertainment: they give power to the otherwise powerless. It doesn't matter how strong you are, quick you are, intelligent you are in real life; video games are the great equalizer capable of turning even the weakest among us into gods among men, or goddess among women in this case. This is a world where the girls all have power over their environments, where their skills, and their talents, and their ability to work together allows them to succeed. Also consider that the villains of these pieces, clockwork Germans, mechanical soldiers, knights and trolls, are all generic fantasy creations, cartoonish in their simplicity. Again the girls turn them into monsters they can reasonably defeat because their only hope of defeating the monsters in the other layers is through surrender.<br /><br />That's why the fantasy needs to be there. These girls exist in a world where their skills are dismissed and where their talents are graded on their curves. Bob Chipman of The Escapist said that \\"This is a movie that invites the so-called male gaze, and then spits in its face.\\" These girls exist in a world where exploitation is the norm, so they quite logically retreat to worlds where they can transcend that exploitation.<br /><br />This whole thing brings me to how these layers interact. Each layer is a buffer of protection against the very harsh realities these girls, Baby Doll specifically, have to face. The video game layer is their attempt to find empowerment to justify their having to debase themselves to get what they need to survive. In the other layers, the only talents that will allow them to succeed are their abilities to dance (brothel world), seduce (institution world), or submit to sexual exploitation (unseen reality). The fact that so many layers of fantasy are required to make these acts even remotely palatable goes a long way toward suggesting just how much these girls must go through to win out in the end. As Scott Mendelson says in his review on the Huffington Post \\"'\\"Zach[sic] Snyder just made While he raped me, I closed my eyes and imagined myself somewhere else: The Movie.'\\" It's an apt epithet for a disturbing movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately, few get past the sexy girls kicking monster butt. Closer examination drains the titillation out of the movie, when you realize that it's dealing with very real, very vile exploitation. While not a perfect movie -- I would go so far as to call Sucker Punch a beautiful mess -- it is definitely a movie that fills the screen with flash and dazzle, but it's flash and dazzle that begs to be scratched, begs to be dissected, begs to expose the very real and very twisted underbelly, the reality we never see, the reality that is only hinted at, and is only made the more disturbing by its absence.o the otherwise powerless.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I started playing this game thinking I would only play for a few minutes but after an hour I realized I was addicted. simple graphics but a lot of fun.

B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|So I've got a decent sized CD collection, most of it being rap, this is still in my top 5 favorite CD's of all time. I love this CD, so much in fact that I actually went to go see him in concert and it was amazing. Here is the song by song review:  1. Grenade: 5/5 This is hands down one of the best on the CD, though it's incredibly overplayed.  2. Just The Way You Are: 4/5 Its good, but its so girly, and again very overplayed.  3. Our First Time: 2/5 The only wrong thing with this album. Its so sexed up and nasty, I don't like it very much.  4. Runaway Baby: 5/5 Absolutely incredible, this is the most upbeat song on the album and its also one of my favorites.  5. The Lazy Song: 5/5 This song is really funny, and a fun, easy listen.  6. Marry You: 5/5 Yet another great song on the album, and nice upbeat tune with some mildly amusing lyrics. Just a nice song for the album.  7. Talking to the Moon: 5/5 I didn't realize how awesome this song was until he performed it at the concert. The thing I love most about this song it the great hook to it.  8. Liquor Store Blues: 4/5 It's alright, but not great. One of the weaker songs on the album. I  9. Count on Me: 5/5 This is just a fun little happy song, the performance at the concert was great. I just like how happy it is.  10. The Other Side: 5/5 This is hands down my favorite on the album, I don't care how awesome Grenade or Talking to the Moon were, but this song takes the cake. I absolutely love this song and its a perfect way to end the album.    Final Score: 9.0/10

The clarity and practicality of Mike's tips are surprising and refreshing. It just felt so much more systematic and \\"doable\\" than so much of what I've read in the past. Very approachable. I also very much enjoyed going through Mike's online supplemental resources.    I made a couple of key changes in the way I approach a mixing project as a result of this book, and it's making a noticeable difference in the quality of my mixes, and in my enjoyment of the craft.    Thanks Mike!

0307594009|4.0|In this compelling novel Anne Frank is forced to go into hiding when the Nazis are threatening her family.  She is moved to an annex above her father's work place.  Since her family and some friends are near the work place, some of the employees that work for Anne's dad can now help them survive.  During their hiding many truths come out and there is a lot of fighting.  This book is fascinating in many ways. To find out how it ends you'll just have to read this magnificent book.<br /> Is this book really a \\"downer\\" in the words of many mad parents, librarians, and even teachers?  This book, in my opinion, is very well written.  The diction in the book surprised me as I thought a thirteen year old girl would never use such anecdotic words. This book has a lot of voice in it which makes her words sink in and stay there.  The Diary of Anne Frank also teaches us how lucky we are to not have war going on in our country.  It is hard to take into perspective that this book isn't fiction. It is true.  In my opinion this book is amazing and what makes it amazing is the true words written by Anne Frank.<br /> Although this book is usually always interesting, there are some boring parts.  Be prepared to just get through the boring parts.  In most of these sections the families are just fighting.  Unfortunately the fighting is usually about the same thing: Anne.  Other than the constant fighting and some boring parts this book is awesome.<br /> I loved this book because I have a great interest in Holocaust literature.  This is a book for middle school students, mostly around the age of 12-15.  I would recommend this book for girls because Anne talks about \\"girl stuff\\".  Just remember that this is a factual story and you will be truly amazed at Anne's positive attitude towards the whole war.  Please read this book as it has amazed me and many others.
B002BWQ6H6|1.0|I found this book overly sappy, long winded and written as if only to tug emotions. I found the writing to be extremely pointless and tedious. After the first section about the monk living in NYC in the 70s I did not care about any of the characters. I was so disappointed because this book had come highly recommended but I truly hated it and found it painfully boring and tedious to read. I admit that I actually skimmed some sections just to get through it. I felt it had a pro-religious undertone which also did not interest me. I do not recommend this book at all.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Love this game. Had on my iPod Touch. The wifi download blows though. This game is, challenging but easy to learn.  You don't have to be a die hard gamer to play it.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This app locks up every time within a few seconds of launch on Viewsonic G-Tablet running TnT-Lite v 4.4.0.  Audio keeps running, but the video freezes and no amount of poking does anything.  Have to force close.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|This is another classic game on par with Angry Birds. However, the port needs some speed and stutter refinements. The end of level animation is very pixelated and choppy, but tbe game is fantastic and fun over all.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is a blast. Runs smooth. My daughters love it as well. Have had no issues with it so far.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Love the show.  I just started watching it last fall and laughed my butt off.  Sheldon is freakin' hilarious.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|It's like a thrilling movie playing out where only a few people know what's really happening. This is a terrific book and kept me glued to it all the way through!
B001AQT0OU|3.0|Recently I ordered Barry Lyndon Blu-ray, which hasn't arrived yet. What has arrived is an email from Amazon informing me that I have received, as a gift for making the purchase, a video-on-demand of the same movie. Sounds swell, doesn't it? But read the find print. You'll have two weeks in which to watch it--after which it's unavailable. And within that two-week period, once you begin watching it, you'll have 48 hours in which to complete your one-time viewing.    What a gift this is, Mr. Bezos! Whoop de doo!
B00005N6KG|4.0|I had a pair of these all through college and for 2 years after. The other reviews that say that one side of the headphones stops working are probably true, though it took my old ones 6 years for that to happen. I figure for around $10, that's way beyond my expectations. So far so good with my new ones. These are super comfortable and stay put when I am running. The sound quality is really good for such an inexpensive product. I will continue to buy these as long as Sony keeps making them, as I haven't been able to find a set of headphones or earbuds that fit my ears and stay in place like these do.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|This CD contains the beautiful music of Morricone, primarily works written for films, and beautifully executed by the master cellist, Yo Yo Ma.  This is a must have for those who treasure the talents of Yo Yo Ma and the skills of Morricone.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Can't put it down. Best game for your phone by far. I'm so glad I got it when it was free otherwise I'd be missing out.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Well, I finally give in and downloaded this game in the final hour of the free day, because I'm not excited about zombie games. took a bit to download but plays surprisingly well on my tab.  i really was surprised because last time I downloaded chuzzle which was totally NoT compatible with tablets and that doesn't display well but still have because chuzzles r so cute and I played it a lot on the pc. anywho, the bad about zombies is that u don't get to save your plants once u step out the game, it's a whole redo, and there's no point to boost ur ego. I like points/numbers :)
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Downloaded yesterday onto my Droid X and so far so good! My spare time will never be the same. No complaints, and already blowing through level.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love plants v. zombies so much that I'm playing it through again! Would recommend this to anyone that listens. Good graphics, addictive game play and a sense of humor. What is not to like?
B0052UZIFA|5.0|a great price today (free)! Works awesome on my Xoom and also on my HTC Thunderbolt! I played this game on the PC till I beat it, so I wouldn't  have paid for it, so thanks Amazon!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|good story, but it was mostly dark @ the beginning...Dnt watch it unless your in a Dark room. but other than tht it was a great movie.
054531058X|4.0|The familiar theme of a futuristic society takes a new twist in this compelling story of 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen in District 12 of Panem, a post-apocalyptic North America.  Collins' story-line is thought-provoking and alarming, as we learn that Katniss and her male counterpart Peeta, must fight to the death against each other and 22 other District Tributes at the annual Hunger Games.<br /><br />I was nervous while I read this book.  I could not imagine how Katniss and Peeta would manage in such a violent arena.  I worried at every turn about the dynamics between characters.<br /><br />There are many conflicts and difficulties and how Katniss, Peeta and the other Tributes confront their problems, align with enemies and for some, ultimately fail, is both fascinating and disturbing.<br /><br />This will make a great movie!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Showed which channel is strongest coming from wireless router so i was able to change router's default channel to strongest channel so all wireless units now connect faster and stronger. A must have app!!!
B0051QIGP4|1.0|This download cost me $0.99 and I still feel like I overpaid. I found myself switching over to her first album instead.  This album feels pretentious and self-absorbed to the point of being flat-out irritating. Overall, it's a good deal for avid fans but those who preferred \\"The Fame\\" may want to skip this one.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Fantastic. And Free for limited time. Great New Layout. Only complaint is that sound always is on by default.. Other than that flawless.  Would remove a star if it doesn't have the mini games..
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I've been waiting all month for this to be the app of the day! Runs quite well except that my Epic 4g crashes hardcore after about two levels of playing at a time. Seems like it is just me though from the other comments.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|BE AWARE! Why does it ask permission to access the calls and their identities? I've just read an article about these infected apps that accesses thing that it doesn't need for whats it's made for. BE AWARE!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Great game,  I've played the other versions, but in comparation to the ios version,  this looks like crap on my droid x, especially the low resolution graphics.  With that said,  the game is responsive, but chunky at times. And the stretching looks horrible.
B002VPE1XY|1.0|This case was hyped to me from Amazon as a case for my recently purchased Lumix camera.  The case was too small for the Lumix and seemed cheaply constructed.  On the other hand it was very inexpensive.  I sent it back.  You get what you pay for.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works perfectly on both my devices. Great time killer and pretty fun compared to most apps. Get it and you'll be happy.
B0036S4C6G|2.0|Well, so much for Pulitzer Prize Winners.   This is the first Pulitzer-winning novel that I can't even finish.  The characters are not interesting and I have absolutely no empathy for them.  Try as I might, I'm having a very hard time finding anything positive to say about this book.    What a disappointment.   I saw the author interviewed some time back on the Charlie Rose show wherein the author said it was a book about time.  Time is an extremely interesting concept to try to capture -- too bad that the author completely failed in her attempt.
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|There are 2 discs here.  One is a DVD of the concert (with bonus material of some other performances, back stage stuff and fan interviews), the other is a music CD of live performances.  Both are excellent.  Besides the great music the thing I like about it is that the audience doesn't ruin the recording. So often live recordings are ruined (to me) by whistling, shouting and overall obnoxiousness of the audience (maybe that is just a US thing).  Not so here, these folks came to listen to music, not become part of the recording. A couple of times the lead singer of The Killers, Brandon Flowers, asks the crowd to sing along, but that's about it.   As musicians, The Killers are very good, particularly the drummer Ronnie Vannucci.  Before you purchase, check out 'Human' from this concert on youtube.com for an idea of what the rest of the dvd and cd is like.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Having never played a Plants vs. Zombies game before I wasn't sure what to expect. Now I'm wishing I had jumped on this series sooner.   The touch controls are damn near flawless on my Evo, the animations are super smooth, the game play itself is very fun, and it was free!   I would have gladly paid for this.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Droid 1 doesn't work. Archos 70 crashes.  Tegra tablet just shows black screen.  Angry birds and every other must have app works on all three devices- even Netflix.  You can do better, Popcap.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|All of the bad reviews on here are crap.  This is a great movie.  Anyone who says otherwise is a joke.  Movies are about the imagination. Maybe some reviewers should grow up or probably grow young.  A must see thrill ride.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|This is truly one of the greatest, most addictive games ever created.  It will load on the Gtab...but sadly crashes in the midst of gameplay.  I'm hoping that they release a high def version that will run better on the Tegra 2.....curious if other Tegra 2 tabs have issues with this.....sigh.....if it had run, my life would have been close to perfect.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|just tried and after putting down for a few mins and ur screen goes off to save pwr, you cannot get screen back on.  you need to reset the phone which means pulling out the battery.  plus this is terrible quality anyway so they shouldnt hav even released this until it was made correctly for mobile phones.  thats popcap 4 ya, jus trying 2 make a dolla
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I was playing the game and got a phone call and was at 2-8 and got a call and it started my game from the start I have a nexus s wtf
B004XWLN20|4.0|This was a great show, and am excited that they have already announced a full series box set.  While I own the first 7 seasons on dvd, I am contemplating selling those of ebay or craigslist in order to buy this collection.  The only thing holding me back from pre-ordering is the fact that it is not available in BLU-RAY.  I just bought a PS3. Now that I have one, if I buy a movie or box-set, I want it in Blu-Ray when ever I can.  I know that the Smallville has been available in HD for some time, and if they did not shoot all 10 seasons with 1080 resolution they can al teast re-master those seasons so as to include them in a Blu-Ray release of this box set...It really would be a bad bad business decision not to do it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|i have been waiting a very long time for this game, worth the wait and the best part is that it was free!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|works great on my t-mobile g2, but i hate the wifi only download thing. would be 5 stars if i could download over 4G. my 4G connection is just as fast or faster than my home internet via wifi so there is no reason to stop me from downloading over 4G.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|love pc version and when I saw it for free. I jumped on it ASAP.  load time not long at all for me and the game play is as smooth as everyone says
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This works great on my captivate. Everything works fine and have found no issues. The only negative is getting a load screen no matter what you do if you leave the game. Even if I just lock the phone. No other game does this, but this game is so addictive who cares?
B000F9RB8A|5.0|Love this movie. I am not as big a fan of kung fu movies as my husband is, but this is a movie we can both enjoy. Action, romance, comedy, and drama all packed into a ridiculous movie.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|PvZ is one of the few games I have been playing steadily for the last 2 years.  I have it on the PC, Xbox, and now on my phone.  It is easily one of the best pound for pound games out there.  Just wish there would be a PvZ2.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Plants vs Zombies invades yet another platform, landing on Android at long last. It's the same game that has wasted many an hour on consoles, iOS devices, and computers, so if you've already played it, you won't see anything new here. You have to defend your home (front yard, back yard, and roof) from the attacking zombies using the only tool at your disposal: an arsenal of plants. There are a couple dozen of plants and upgrades to combat the increasingly inventive intruders. At its core, PvZ is another tower defense title, eschewing complex level design in favor of creative enemies over a limited span of terrain to develop the challenge level. The Adventure mode spans 50 levels, 3 venues, two of which feature 10 night stages (where the sun can't provide resources). There is enough content for sure to justify spending $2.99 and a real steal for those who got it for free on its launch day.    The game itself is a five star effort for sure. However, this version does have one or two problems. For one, there is an awful lot of slowdown at the conclusion of each level. I thought that it might have been an issue with the aging processor of my Nexus One, but the same thing happened on a much more powerful Tegra 2 in my Transformer tablet. The file size is a whopping 75MB, give or take, which can cause trouble for those already low on storage. Thankfully, it can be moved to an SD card on Android 2.2 thru 2.3.4, leaving behind less than 700KB. A more permanent issue though are the visuals. Despite Android tablets finally starting to gain momentum, this version was designed for phones. Missing are the high definition assets we've seen on the console and PC versions as well as the iPad-only \\"Plants vs Zombies HD\\". The layout may be fine for older phones, but even the 5-inch screen on my Dell Streak was begging for something better. On the 10.1\\" Asus Transformer, the low-res visuals were downright depressing.    Plants vs Zombies is a great game that is certainly worth playing. If you use an Android phone, this is certainly a viable option, but tablet users might want to hold out for an HD version instead of plunking down $3 on this download. The description clearly states it is not optimized for tablets and it means it.    Compatibility Notes (Device - OS version - Chipset):  Nexus One - 2.3.4 - Qualcomm SnapDragon 8250     +...Did not install to SD card; works  Dell Streak 5 - 2.2 - Qualcomm SnapDragon 8250     +...Works  Viewsonic gTablet - 2.2 with stock 1.2-4349 - Nvidia Tegra 2    x...Inconsistent results; random freezes and force closes  Asus TF-101 - 3.0.1 - Nvidia Tegra 2    +...Works
B0052UZIFA|4.0|The graphics are very nice, and the gameplay is fantastic, only complaint is that when getting a new seed it lags hard. Great start though, worth the price of admission if there will be patches.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I love the artwork, and it's a neat idea. The gameplay is intuitive and not too difficult so as to remove the game from the casual genre. With that said, the game is just good. It get's repetative quickly and doesn't break any new ground in the castle/turret defence catagory. I do like the game, and I know I'll play it on the train tomorrow. Buy it, you'll like it more than I did I'd bet.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|luckily i got this as amazons free app of the day.  that means i paid to much.  you cant rate a game that you cant play.<br /><br />i have a view sonic gtablet with stock rom.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this games way way too addictive! at first it feels like it could be a slow easy game then before you know it, it has started speeding up ad you get frantic looking for little bits of sunshine! oh man why did ib do this? BECAUSE ITS FUN!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|runs great on my htc TB! just what I expected. have yet to see any of the lag or bugs that other people are speaking of
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Have you watched the video. what the Hell is that! I'm not downloading for that reason alone. I'll give it a five though because my comment has nothing at all to do with the game.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I just tried this on my Droid X with the new Android 2.3.3 update and it seems to be working great
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I've played this game on other platforms and was excited to see this application.  But it's utterly crazy to require a wifi connection to download.  Reverse this decision Amazon or in won't be using your appstore
B0052UZIFA|4.0|A fun game that will burn through your time.  Graphics could be improved a little but are still very solid.
B000Q6ZG5C|5.0|The first two movies of the series - Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets - are the only ones that ever made to DVD in the expanded editions.  Unfortunately, those editions are no longer available.  For those who own them, they are relatively clear videos and the expanded portions are important.  Unfortunately Warner Brothers does not seem to want to issue them any more, and those that followed, beginning with Prisoner of Azkaban, won't be issued that way.  \\"Director's Cut!\\"  As the director wanted it.  Actually, what it means is WB set the time limits, and the directors made the best of it.  Prisoner of Azkaban would not improve much with the extended edition, but the transfer4 to Blu-Ray is a major step forward anyway.  The picture is clearer, and for a movie that has this much darkness in it, that's important.  The others in the series - Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows part one - all improve with the addition of Blu-Ray.    They would also improve with the extended editions.  My suspicion is that WB will issue a 3-D version of the movies in the extended edition and be able to soak us yet again for more money.    I am a late comer to Blu-Ray, and I haven't been won over yet by 3-D.  But these movies really do improve with the clarity of the emission.    Now if ABC Family can show extended editions, why can't WB issue them?
B001TH8UUA|1.0|I bought this cable to be able to connect my HDTV with my laptop and/or blue ray disc player. No problem with the Blue Ray, but with the laptop, the signal disappears randomly for a period of 2 or 3 seconds. I get another cable from Best Buy and problem solved: No more interruptions between the laptop and the HDTV. My laptop have an Nvidia video card with 1gb of dedicated video memory and works great with the cable i get from best buy.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I love this game. I played it oon iPad before. but the resolution on my T-Mobile G2 isn't sso crazy. could be better. but still thanks for bringing to Android. perfect time kkiller
0671042858|5.0|I admit it. I'm biased. I have read all of King's work. I love most of it. There have been a few that I appreciated as being well written, but didn't connect with emotionally.<br /><br />This book, however, was fantastic.<br /><br />And I really, REALLY connected with the tough little girl who happens to love Tom Gordon!<br /><br />This is classic King and yet also happens to be New and Improved, Wise, Mature King.<br /><br />A delightfully fast paced, action packed, heartbreaking, scary, thought provoking, masterpiece. Buy it now, and remember this:<br /><br />If you go ANYWHERE where you might end up lost in the wilderness, make DAMN SURE you let someone know where you are going, when you will return, when to call the search party if you don't check in, and some means of starting a fire and boiling water!!!!
0743299795|4.0|\\"An excellent book which goes very deeply into the history of the car industry. The authors also clearly support through comprehensive research on comparison between traditional mass production systems approach and lean production systems approaches on the global car industry. This book is still quite relevant even in today's car market, or any industry for that matter when one considers moving to a lean environment. Mass production approach and theory is becoming less and less relevant and sustainable in a 21st century business, this book could already see this as the 21st century was approaching, this book was written in 1990.     This book does require deep study, and can be challenging at times if you are someone who needs extra time with reading and understanding statistical information. In my opinion it is well work the extra time and effort.\\"
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I cannot believe all the people complaining when they get something for free. i thought this game was awesome even when it was on pc. This game is 70 MB but is worth the download.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|I am a new fan of Lady Antebellum as I have never cared for their name and therefore didn't pay much attention to them.  But I love the song \\"Need You Now\\" so I bought this CD and I became a huge fan.  The three of them work so well together.  I particularly like Hilliary Scott's voice and style.  Her voice is quite unique and very crisp and clear and I can even understand her words.  That is rare these days.  Their country/pop sound is amazing.  i bought their first CD after this one and also am enjoying it but they have improved their sound in their second CD.  I can't wait for the next one which I believe is coming soon.
B0026IA0QS|5.0|People go on and on about the artistic credibillity of Alejandro Jodorowsky but let's face it, most of his fans like him because they're wierdos who want to see the strangest possible thing on their screens.  Admittedly I'm one of those wierdos.  But I can honestly say that this is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen.  It contains enough crazy scenes to satisfy the die hard Jodorowsky fan, such as an elephant ejaculating blood out of it's trunk for no aparent reason, but unlike his other films like THe Holy Mountain, the wierdness takes a back seat to the story which flows at a perfectly timed beautiful rhythm.  I would recommend this film to any arthouse fan.  Though it may be too out there for the mainstream, it is full of enough substance to satisfy anyone who wants to see something that they've never seen before.  Boom.
B000ERU9S2|5.0|I have to agree with the previous poster that this film is great and can be viewed over and over.  I read on Rotten tomatoes from the critics more often that they felt this movie was okay.  In the end it comes down to personal preference.  Although I do believe quality is an important factor in any film ie; story, characters, direction, special affects and writing.  Robert De Niro has some of the greatest one liners in the film and Jean Reno as a supporting actor opposite was a perfect choice.  I'm someone who likes to watch the extras or the making of for my favorite films.. I watched the extras on the second disc.. and was a little borish.  However it was still nice to get feedback from the actors..
B0052UZIFA|5.0|LG Optimus V this games works perfectly on this phone. I love the computer version and now on the go I can play it on my phone.
B003UESJH4|4.0|Well, this movie has gotten so much press thanks to its Oscar nominations and wins, that you probably don't need a whole lot of convincing to watch it (if you haven't already).  As a result, I will keep this review a bit short and provide a quick review of what I think is great about the movie and more importantly the special features provided.  Watching the movie is one thing; it is a 5-star movie.  Buying it is another.<br /><br />The movie itself seems like a great educational tool for anyone not so much because of the history but because of the courage displayed by Albert (King George VI).  I was first intrigued by a coworker who \\"accidentally\\" showed it to his kids as this movie has an R rating.  Well, after watching this movie, I seriously think an R rating is overkill.  PG-13, maybe; R, no.  There is so much value in a movie like this.  This is not to say that your 8 year old should watch it.  There are definitely themes to this movie that would bore a child that is not at least in their teens, but if a child can appreciate World and/or British History to some extent, it should be somewhat interesting.  Plus, what person or child doesn't have some fear of public speaking.  Generally speaking, this movie is about overcoming this obstacle.  Granted, the condition faced by Albert is more than a fear of public speaking, but it is a lesson in not giving up.<br /><br />The issue of language that got this movie an R rating, is ridiculous.  There is one scene where Albert goes through repetition with some vulgar language (2 minutes maybe), but they are by no means used with any meaning other than showing that he knows the words and can say them.  They aren't used in sentences or in a derogatory manner.  Most people have heard these words, including our children, and that certainly shouldn't trump the value of this movie. It definitely isn't advocating their use.<br /><br />As for the DVD itself, I have to say that the special features provided aren't fantastic.  There is a little making of video that is ok, but if you aren't much into these things, there won't be much to learn.  I did enjoy the inclusion of the real speech as recorded as well as a speech the King gave at the end of World War II.  It makes one appreciate the documentary nature of the movie as well as the acting that went into it.  I'm normally indifferent when it comes to Oscars, but Colin Firth definitely earned his win.  Last, there is an interesting little feature about the speech therapist that is really interesting from a reality point of view.<br /><br />So, is the DVD worth purchasing? It probably should be if you were a huge fan of the movie.  It is however, definitely worth watching even for your teen (and ideally with your teen).  The R rating is ridiculous unless you really find bad language that offensive.of video that is ok, but if you aren't much into these things, there won't be much to learn.

B0052UZIFA|4.0|it's a good game but i have an undervolted and overclocked DROID x and it freezes and gets super hot. i have set the cpu to a lower clock speed so it doesn't get too hot
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This sucks that it won't load on a dell steak 7 with android 2.2.2 update.  anyone have a fix?  Downloaded this app twice...  Stupid amazon!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this game is purely fun, funny, and addicting. I totally recommend. I should've paid for this game but I got it free thanks to Amazon free app of the day. I never heard of this game. did research and found out that it's popular in the world of Apple os and I'd be happy to paid for it if curious to see how this game goes for the first time playing it. best game ever.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I own for pc, ipad, and xbox. Works perfectly fine on my stock droid x! Super fun and addicting, but you need to progress several levels before the strategy really kicks in.
006054094X|4.0|This is one of the best written and researched books I have read. It captures the Chinese explorations c1421 in vivid detail. However, I belive time will tell that there were others who traveled these routes before the Chinese and were the ones who gave the Chinese the maps to make the journey. This is borne out by the fact that the routes that the Chinese took were obviously touring routes rather than exploritory routes.     Minzies himself writes that the Chinese met civilized Europians in places far from Europe.
B001E45XT4|5.0|At first I was a bit skeptical because of the price. But let me tell you--these are the absoulutely best head phones in this price range. I wasn't looking to spend to much money for gamming head phones and these are perfect. If you have any doubt in your mind about comfort, quality, clearity, let this review eliminate that. These are absolutely amazing for this low price! GET THEM NOW.
B004UC1WN8|4.0|Compared to Brave her last album before this one, I LOVE IT! Majority of the songs in my opinion are likeable! Of course the strongest song on the album is \\"On the floor\\" in my opinion i think the weakest song is \\"Good Hit\\". As for the other songs:    I'm Into you: This song features Lil Wayne which in my opinion i don't think he's needed. But the song is good, and a very good summer song with a good beat. 8.5/10    (What is) Love?: Well if you watched the movie \\"Backup plan\\" and stayed tuned to the end credits this song is played, and doesn't change at all on the cd version which was released a long time after. Pretty good song. 7.5/10    Run the World: Good song. 8.0/10    Papi: Great song with a great heavy beat, it makes you want to get up and dance. 8.5/10    Until it beats no more: Love this song, I love the fact that Jennifer slows it down bit from all the dance tracks, and In my opinion i think she sounds great in it. 8.3/    Invading my mind: Co-written by Lady Gaga, great dance track, love how Jennifer's voice sounds in this song. One of the best songs on the CD. 8.6/10    Villian: Haven't heard too much of this song to write a review Sorry!    Hypnotico: LOVE THIS SONG!! Best song on the album behind \\"On the floor\\" 9.0/10
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Finally out for Android. Very nice animations and great gameplay. So fun and addictive I can hardly get any work done.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|This film is absolutely fantastic. It's now one of my all time favourite films.  Laura Dern is brilliant in this, I'm surprised this role didn't garnish her with any awards like the oscars or golden globes.  If you have a taste for the surreal and bizarre, Inland Empire is your type of movie.  It's beyond creative and I just adore David Lynch for making these type of movies, for artists and intellects.  Inland Empire's plot is mystical and puzzling, it's like a woman's decent into complete total madness.  It reminds me of Natalie Portman's role in Black Swan, but this movie is 10 times better. I was in a trance while watching this, it took me 3 days to watch and each night it just got better and better.  I can't praise this film enough.  I hope David Lynch continues to make art, he's one of the best of his kind and I love him.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|have long loved this on iOS and now get to let it suck the life out of the Thunderbolt. Have played enough to see how it acts when a phone call come in, and it resumed nicely. Couple of lags when a lot of action on screen but think it has more to do with my phone than the app itself.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|i played this on a friends phone it was fun dont get me wrong but it doesn't want to work or is incompatible with Motorola Droid 1. why on 2 and x but not 1? dusk for a free download that wont work i give it a 1 as a game 2.5 to a 3
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I've been trying to download it for the last couple of days, but the wifi in my hotel and at work is too slow and crappy to download the whole thing before I get disconnected, and the amazon app store seems to be too dumb to resume the download.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I simply can't believe all the negative reviews I've been reading. This is the best show on television, well-written, amazingly suspenseful and utterly unexpected. One minute you're laughing, the next you're crying. You actually feel sorry for this monster, this serial killer born of blood. The show twists your insides and plays with your head. In the last season you hope against hope that Dexter will finally find someone who will truly understand him unlike Miguel from a prior season, who only used him for his own purposes. Dexter has found that he needs love and acceptance and you want Lumen to love him...and she does. I think she may make another appearance. At least I hope she does.
3836503050|5.0|In my opinion, Gil Elvgren's pin-ups are the best and this book proves it. Lots of pictures and the story behind them. The quality of the book is insuperable, Taschen is great. If you want a pin-ups book, this is the one to have.

B004K4AVAG|4.0|This album is very stylish with powerful and unwavering vocals from Lady Gaga on every track; her vocals unite a very electic and sometimes internationally flavored album. The production values on this album are through the roof and terrific. Lady Gaga manages to make a hybrid album from a wide variety of 80s sources: new wave in the manner of Depeche Mode, 80s pop in the manner of Madonna, 80s power-pop in the manner of Pat Benetar and 80s rock in the manner of Bruce Springsteen. It is also influenced by late 80s girl pop, and there are 80s sound nuances, 80s vocal hooks, and hints of 80s optimism interlaced through the entire album. This album also incorporates 90s dance music, German disco, and Latin-flavored pop. It even manages to pay homage to Queen and The Eagles in the same song - You and I, not an easy feat for any artist. The biggest downside for the album are the lyrics, sometimes the lyrics are just cheesy (not in a good way), obvious, strained and synthetic. On the plus side, Lady Gaga spares her listeners from a ballad, and she embraces a clever mosiac of soundscapes. The album flows quite well from start to finish as any well-crafted album should, and most of the songs work better in their album format than as stand-alone singles. Suprisingly, the album continously builds up momentum through tbe arrangement of its songs, and it exits on a high note. All and all, Lady Gaga has made an impressive pop album (good pop albums are always a rarity) and a cleverly constructed pop album that is multilayered and improves with subsequent listens.
0446691437|4.0|Not a difficult read, the War of Art is delightfully laid out as an inspiration to all artists.  Whatever you may be focusing on in your life where you must be creative and you must take some risk this book puts your heart at ease and says just go for it, you really have nothing to lose.<br />This book I'm sure I will a reference for years to come, it offers encouragement down the path of being an artist and really opens your eyes to all the fears you may have to face before they are upon you.  Before you set up on a new path in life or if you are ready for a new change this book is a wonderful read.<br /><br />@JephMaystruck

006072448X|4.0|You cannot deny that this novel is compelling. It may be self indulgent and bloodies its dead horses but the plot is gripping. There are no sympathetic characters in this novel and our Kevin is indulged in seemingly implausible ways. His father is particularly one dimensional and the author is distractingly obsessed with overweight and obesity. In fact she's more tolerant of mass murder than pudginess... pretty weird! But still a good read and heartbreaking tale.

0425242099|5.0|I LOVED this book. I loved how Sienna called Hawke on his cowardice, I loved her stregnth, I loved the evolving war with the psy. I think we have seen that scale down a bit in the previous books and given the lead up and the finale of the last book I'm glad it was given the attention it deserved here. I loved the side romance between lara and Walker ( better than a short story in an anthology) and I cannot wait to see who has cubs next!!! I do miss Faith's character from the series. I feel like she was so strong and as such a strong foreseer she should be a strong advantage in the upcoming war. I am also waiting to see who Kaleb was guarding in the previous book. Still, the depth that is slowly being added to Nikita's character is beautiful and intriguing. It was nice to see that the X-psy designation lived up to its reputation- with Judd flaming out all the time- we needed a new resident Badass. I am waiting to see the roles of vasic and aden continue to develop. The only thing is- I wonder, after this book- who will come next? So many of the original characters are either too young to have their own books- like Kit, or don't really interest me- like Rina and Barker- or are already hooked up- like half the snow dancer lieutenants. I think it is time to involve the psy in some of the romances again. Anyways- Nalini, as usual, does not disappoint and her books- as you can tell from this review, left me completely satisfied, while still begging for more!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Doesn't have all features from the pc version but has enough. Love it and don't b afraid of the size of ur screen cause it looks good anyway.
0857680986|5.0|Andrew Loomis books are highly recommended by so many professional artists, and now we have one of his most famous books back in print! The book is large enough to give excellent full page spreads of Loomis' beautiful artwork and very helpful writings, yet it's not too big that it's uncomfortable to sit down and read through. I highly recommend this to any mature aspiring artist and even if you're already a pro, this is still a necessary book for your collection.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|What an awesome, hilarious game! Graphics look fine, runs great on my Optimus V. Maybe it's a bit slow to load, but it's totally worth it.
B000TGJ8IU|3.0|If something is labelled as \\"Ultimate Edition\\" I expect it to have only the best. This set is not available in Blu-Ray.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|game is like most other tower defense games, but with some really good concepts and fun things that make it different
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game rocks  it is a lot of fun to play but everyones gotta be hating everything.  droid..... your almost 2 years old.  heck droid 3 is almost out....... update your phone! im sick of all the dumb hicks who cant read and blame it on developer.... btw wifi is amazon policy.... game is 700k when on sd card.  and it took about 2-3 minutes to dl on my wifi.  popcap this game is fun.  yoy guys did great!

B001N1DPDE|5.0|just got this thing today! Haven't used it yet but I can tell it is definitely made for survival chores and very tough, probably last for years! If you want a fighting knife, it would work against a mountain lion, but may piss-off a Kodiak bear! I can tell this will be a very dependable tool!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Been looking forward to this game coming out for quite some time. Thank you pop cap and amazon! I recommend it.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I purchased the download during the 99 cent promotion period.  I figured the one song that I wanted would have cost more than that so I had nothing to lose.  I guess I wan in the minority since I had absolutely no problems downloading it.  I have to say it is the best 99 cents I have ever spent.  I love the entire CD - which is something I can't say about most of the CD's/Albums (yes I grew up with albums)& I can't stop listening to it. have even placed the entire CD into a playlist on my i-pod so I can listen to it at work.  Great Job Gaga! - looking forward to your next CD!
B004BJMEO6|5.0|This is the most enjoyable lesbian film I have ever watched. It really stands out among other popular lesbian films. I enjoyed [most of] the acting, the script and picture quality.     The main storyline was realistic and grew in intensity as the movie progressed. I could feel the chemistry between the pair.     I first watched this on Netflix and enjoyed it so much that I bought it and had to come write a review.
B004WJV6OY|5.0|Totally Awesome.  Totally Awesome.  You will want to watch it over and over again!  Acceptable for anyone who likes music.  The two bonus cover songs: ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER and BLACKBIRD in the dvd EXTRAS are indeed a bonus!

B000HC2LI0|5.0|This box set is AWESOME.  I LOVE West Wing, and I think that the file-style packaging is genius.  I only wish that they included episode titles with the episode numbers listed on the backs of each season.

B004RQVVGU|5.0|Wow...  Even on my sub-par factory-issued bottom-of-the-line car stereo, the 2011 remaster of \\"Diary\\" comes through crystal clear and with booming bass; \\"Believer\\" never sounded so good.  And thank god Ozzy grew the spine to demand that his vindictive wife reinstate the original rhythm section tracks.  Oh, and the inclusion of \\"new\\" live Randy material doesn't hurt either, though I suspect that it may be a polished-up copy of \\"Bat's Head Soup\\" (can anyone confirm or refute? Thanks!)
B001R4MEUM|5.0|This is one of he Classic albums of Rock and Roll, and possibly the best ever released by Genesis. The album tells the story of a dream by Rael, the main protagonist, who lives in NYC. As dreams go it is full of interesting insight into Rael, his problems, and his concerns, which are typical of a teenager in that day. The album is heavy in symbolism and the musical performance is first rate. If you have never heard this album, you should.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|It has been a long time since I have enjoyed a movie as well made and acted as The Kings Speech.  Just so well performed and presented.  I appreciated every aspect of the acting abilities of all the cast and the composition and delivery of their dialog.

0913866156|5.0|This is the third Deck of Thoth I've owned now so I certainly was not expecting anything different. In the image fro the seller it reads \\"oversized\\" or maybe it was large, either way my other two decks were supposed to be the same thing, & the image from the seller read that the deck was held in a lady's hand..these cards are huge & I love it! Yes the exclamation point is needed,I can hold them on the second(middle) knuckle of my fingers & the top of the cards rest almost three full inches above my wrist. The detail is great for someone with less than great vision as myself. Where I used to wear reading glasses to use my other decks I don't need them for this one and that makes me very happy. I have used rider-waite decks and other kinds but nothing is better than the deck of Thoth. If you do not have the book though it's a must in my opinion to help with the symbolism as it's supposed to be read before you go off making your own interpretation for a reading. I am 100% happy with this deck and the price was a STEAL. Also if you have any questions feel free to ask I'd love to help anyone that I can with an issue on this incredible deck.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Game doesn't play on archos 101. Glad it was a free download.  You think games on android are pretty much not good.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Well-polished game, essentially a puzzle game with parts that move on their own accord in a predictable manner. The graphics turn zombie annihilation into whimsical entertainment.  Some of the later puzzles require real thought. Enjoyed it enough to play through several times.<br /><br />Points deducted for lacking features present on the iphone version, which allow you to earn additional mini games.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|While I did enjoy this movie, I enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons.  The visuals and the women in it were great to look at, but there was zero substance in this movie.  The plot was confusing/relatively non-existant.
B004ISVH6G|4.0|Really liked number 1 and most of the disc.   Did find some of the songs kinda of dark.   The pictures were not as complimentary as they could be as John Waite is a very nice looking man!  ;-)

0061733199|5.0|The greatest tools any survivalist can have is knowledge and experience. The SAS Survival Handbook is a great resource for the former, and gives you an opportunity to gain the latter. Armed with the knowledge in this book the reader has the potential to greatly increase his or her chances of survival. The book is very thorough. Not only does it cover all of the required survival topics, but it does so with a wide variety of well thought-out options. I've read a few other survival books that were good, but this is the single one I recommend for people new to the outdoors. Read it, practice it. You may owe your life to it someday.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Wow works great for my rooted mytouch slide love this game kept saying not compatible with your phone but still tryed and it worked!

1400052181|5.0|HeLa cells were the first immortal cells grown in culture ~ the most commonly used human cell line in research. HeLa cells have been used to develop the polio vaccine, and they have been used in research across just about every area from cancer to cosmetics to radiation. The original cells came from the tumor of a woman named Henrietta Lacks, who died shortly after being diagnosed with cervical cancer. Prior to her death, her doctor gave a researcher named George Gey a sample of her cells. The cells divided over and over again, unlike most normal cells that die out after a certain number of divisions. They are still dividing today, 60 years after Henrietta's death.<br /><br />Rebecca Skloot heard about Henrietta during a science class when she was in high school. She became fascinated by this woman whose cells had become immortal, and decided to tell her story. That's what she does in The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.<br /><br />She tells the history of HeLa cells, from the time they were taken from Henrietta through today, when more than 60,000 scientific articles have been written about them. But she also tells the story of the woman named Henrietta Lacks, a woman who grew up on a tobacco farm, moved to Baltimore and raised a family. She tells the story of Henrietta's children, who struggled to come to grips with the knowledge that their mother's cells were taken from her (without the consent of Henrietta or her family) and used to further research ~ and make lots of companies lots of money over the years. Yet her children can barely afford to go to a doctor themselves.<br /><br />It's an amazing story from the perspective of science. The fact that these cells have had such an enormous effect on all sorts of research is remarkable. I'm sure anyone who has worked with HeLa cells would find the book even more interesting. But Skloot has not written this book for the scientist. She has written it for the general reader. While she talks quite a bit about the science behind the story, the real focus is on Henrietta's children and Henrietta herself. It actually reads a bit like a memoir of Skloot's experience researching the book and getting to know Henrietta's family. And it reads like a biography of Henrietta and of her famous cells.real focus is on Henrietta's children and Henrietta herself. It actually reads a bit like a memoir of Skloot's experience researching the book and getting to know Henrietta's family. And it reads like a biography of Henrietta and of her famous cells.
B004FOA84A|4.0|its fun but it really could have been a longer game or have a free play mode with it. I downloaded it as the free app off the day and beat it in no time at all. its worth it as the free app,but probably disappointing to spend money on.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this is a great app to enjoy and pass time with. very addicting game and not too hard on the battery. HTC incredible
B0052UZIFA|5.0|its almost exactly like the computer version minus all the extra puzzles and challenges. its very addicting and also quite humorous.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|When an author's writing is two for two, you start getting really excited about the third one. And then they do a belly flop like Mockingjay. As a writer myself, it could make me cry tears of frustration.<br />First things first: I wasn't looking for a fairytale or a happy ending. Mockingjay has a bad pass at the latter. 1984 and Brave New World were so much more powerful/satisfying at the close.<br />  The pacing was very rushed, and many important plot points were relegated to narration. Characters died randomly with little impact, no one really seemed to care. I hope that's not realistic.<br />  The over all message seemed to be \\"War is evil, but there's no escaping it, so fight if you want, or live in denial. Nothing you do really matters.\\" How . . . inspiring? Who are we kidding.<br />  Somewhere along the way, Haymitch and Katniss lost their humanity & character development. Worse, Katniss lapses into a passive heroine. As the characters droop, so does the point. War is evil and it destroys, war turns people into monsters and machines. We saw it better in Terminator. But conflict can also bring out the best in people, and make them do more than they realized- see Marcus Lutrell's \\"Lone Survivor.\\" What ever happened to what doesn't kill you makes you stronger?<br />  I always thought the love triangle was weak and annoying. Mockingjay made it a bigger deal, and used the pointless death of a character to &lt;clumsily> resolve it.<br />*Spoilers*<br />Peeta is underused, and when Katniss gives in to him, it's exactly that: she passively assents to her \\"feelings.\\" Gale is discarded like a dishrag, which annoyed me even if I didn't care about him.<br />  The only character I did care about by the end was Finnick, and no one in the book seemed too affected when he died. I wonder if Annie read the outline?<br />  Anyhow, it's not worth a read. Buy \\"The Road,\\" \\"1984,\\" \\"Brave New World,\\" or \\"Farenheit 451\\" instead.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is by leaps and bounds the best game for the Android platform. Its graphics are buttery smooth, the gameplay is well balanced and the buttons very responsive. There are very few games worth shelling out money for, but this one is well worth it. (or get it today while its FREE!)
0743454537|1.0|This book had everything going for it in the beginning. The chapters are short, something that I love, and the author pulled the main story, and even an anectodal story about a guy who insured his cigars against fire, then made a claim on them after he smoked them, stright from stories I read about years ago.     The book is enjoyable enough, and a very quick read. I made it through the 500 pages in two days, and was prepared to write a review about how enjoyable the book was, but then the end happened.     I don't think I have ever read a story in which the author so completely eviscerated her entire book, (certainly all the main characters) in an ending. In just one example, the oldest boy goes from being a drunk/drug addict loser, whom the mom states multiple times that she wrote off years ago, becoming a heroic police officer, simply by having his dad confront his pyromania once. I could go on and on, but that would give the story away. What a waste of what could have been a nice story about medical ethics, and parental/minor choice.
038534273X|4.0|A fascinating read of the first 10 years of Google. The book introduces you to all the famous faces of Google. The only down side of this book is not introducing some of the other major faces of Google. Can be a little to praise worthy of Google at times.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|So... let me first say that I enjoyed the first two books very much. Before I decided on the final book, I had to read the reviews.  I flipped through many, many of them but the majority that I got through kept saying it was going to be disappointing.  I figured I would read it first and then form my own opinion about it later.  Well, here's my opinion: I'm empty! This book soooo did not leave me feeling ANYTHING.    You know, I suppose I would have been fine with the ending... Katniss and Peeta both in their states and everything else (there's can't always be a rainbow and unicorns kind of ending, can there?).  The problem I have with this book is that it was so rushed and very little detail (except about the actual fight itself).  Everything that happened I kept having to turn back the page because I thought I missed something (like Prim dying?..I literally turned back and said \\"Wait? What?\\") I just want to say that I wish Collins would have focused more on character development for the characters that she makes a point about introducing.  And can I say that I really started to NOT LIKE Katniss in this book?! Romantically, I felt so bad for Peeta and how Katniss treats him - she's so selfish - and I can't say anything about Gale because even though I was hoping in this third book that Katniss is out of the arena and reunited with Gale that we can see more of how Gale really is, I still feel like he was really flat. I have no emotions for him because unlike Peeta, I can't seem to really read into how he TRULY is.  What his personality would be like.  I felt like I knew Peeta's personality enough to maybe predict what he would do in certain situations but not Gale.. and this is what disappointed me.  Both characters, who were rather a big part of Katniss's life.. seemed to fall flat.      There are a lot of elements in this book that I would have liked to change.. I like happy endings too but I can accept that fact that it's not always like that.  But if it was supposed to make me feel SOMETHING, then give me SOMETHING. If it's supposed to be tragic and sad, make me CRY!  If it was supposed to make me reflect, I am surely not reflecting! I've read other books with a not-so-flowery ending but it left me feeling something inside - like by the end of the story, I could connect with the characters and they would really stay with me.    This book did not do that.  I felt nothing for the characters, especially not Katniss. Collins just took it all away - all the emotions I had begun developing for the characters.  It's gone. Everything and everyone is flat.  The story was too rushed.  All the answers were rushed.  All that time she spent on more than half the book describing battles could have been used to do something more.

B002IVLH60|4.0|...which isn't really saying too much.  Pearl Jam passed their prime about 12 years ago, and it has been very difficult for them to repeat the brilliance they had early in their career.  I think it would have been just an average album back in their hey-day, but this late in their career, I think it is surprisingly good.  This album is a quality release, and is a must for any Pearl Jam fan (unlike a few of their previous offerings).
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Happy to see this finally on the android platform.  Challenging, but not over the top.  Took about 6 hours to beat.  Definitely a must have game.
B00068CVJ4|4.0|...but then again, that would mean The Mars Volta wouldn't.  I actually discovered At The Drive-In because I'm a huge Mars Volta fan.  I really like the sound they had, and even may have preferred the singing style in ATDI (too much falsetto weirdness in TMV sometimes).  These are some really great rock songs, and as musicians, they are very talented.  My only complaint is that it sounds like this album could have used a bit more production.  Don't get me wrong, I love the raw sound, but at times things sound out of tune, the harmonies don't quite harmonize just right, and the dynamics could have been a bit more dynamic.  That's the only reason I don't give this 5 stars.

Finally, ten books later we get to see his story.  I knew of course, that he was somehow going to end up with Sienna, but I had no idea how it was going to work out.  I have also heard quite a bit of talk about her age being awkward since she is only 19, but that never seem to be an issue in this book.  Sienna has experienced more than the average Psy in her 19 short years and her maturity level and actions often reflect this.  The relationship between her and Hawke also has a slow, almost aggravatingly so, build therefore everything feels natural and not forced.  I find it extremely interesting that now SnowDancer and DarkRiver both have Psy women keeping the attention of the alphas.     Speaking of DarkRiver, we do get little glimpses into their lives in this book, which I appreciated.  Especially since Sascha is pregnant and has been for a couple of books now.  I wanted to see if she actually has her baby and just check in on her and Lucas.  The first book has always been one of my favorites and I loved getting updates on the characters from it.  Sascha functions as the heart of her pack and this often bleeds over into SnowDancer and their members.  They are all interconnected and Nalini has done a great job of weaving their lives together.    Another bonus was the other story being told throughout this one.  We got an additional couple finding their way to each other:  Lara, the SnowDancer pack healer and Walker Lauren, one of the Psy that lives with the pack.  They have a completely different courtship from any other couple we have seen before, but I am glad it was just interwoven into this story and not it's own book.  I like watching them bond, but I am not sure an entire book with the two of them would have held my attention.    Alright, back to Hawke and Sienna.  If you have read these books before, you know that Hawke lost his mate when he was young and as a result he has never opened his heart to anyone else.  Sienna refuses to let that excuse fly.  She practically forces Hawke to open his eyes to the possibility of being happy again and uses some very interesting methods to get her point across.  The best was the scene in the bar where she lures Hawke to her.  I was dying laughing at his reaction to her behavior and watching Kit get in on the action by helping Sienna out was just as amusing.  You will have to read to see what I am talking about because any other detail and I will ruin the fun for you.    My favorite scene with Hawke and Sienna though is in the woods when Hawke gives her a 20 minute head start and tells her to run.  The chase was on and it was awesome!  The playful aspect of their relationship was just as thrilling to watch as their tender moments.  This book has become my favorite of the series for so many reasons, but it has also affrirmed my love for Nalini's writing.  I am not sure who is up next in the Psy/Changling world but I know I will always be picking these books up to see what Nailini has in store for us next!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I download a few of these apps and this is the first I've ever reviewed.  Thanks Amazon for this great game.  My THunderbolt loves it.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Can't download even on a good wifi connection. I don't know about the graphic quality of the game since I can't download it successfully but from the pictures I've seen they don't look mind blowing, specially for the size of the app.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I picked this book up because my best friend said she loves it and has read it many times. I had the thought that I might be able to get closer to her and tap into her mind. Well it worked. Upon reading this book I found myself constantly lost within the pages living the life of Sam Roth. He and I have so much in common that my best friend now calls me Sam. She and Grace also reflect each other perfectly and so I cal her Grace. This book has changed my life in ways I could never have imagined. I loved every single word I read.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I always check the description to see if the dev was nice enough to put a list of devices that might not be compatible with the app, it seems that some people who gave this one star didn't check it first as some of the complaints are related to phones listed as incompatible with the app. Though it can still be a hit or miss as I'm running a My Touch 3G Slide and it works great on my phone even though it is listed as incompatible when I went to download it. For those of you see that your phone is on this list and still try to download only to see that it doesn't work, don't complain as the dev already told you in the DESCRIPTION that your phone will NOT work.<br />Plants vs. Zombies will not run on the following devices:<br />--Motorola DROID (works fine on Motorola DROID 2 and some DROID X's), Devour, Flipside<br />--Samsung Transform, Intercept<br />--HTC Aria, MyTouch 3G<br />--Sony Ericsson X8<br />--Sanyo Zio<br />--Kyocera Echo<br />--LG Ally
B000PY52EU|4.0|It's a very odd movie but not in a bad way it would be good on it's own but what really make's this movie is the sound track. Gritty delta blues at it's best. I understand Samuel L Jackson learned the guitar for this part, He learned it very well.
B00003CXA6|5.0|I got this to watch before my son's field trip to Gettysburg. It was very well done, and enjoyable to watch. It helped me to envision what I would see once I made it to Gettysburg. I would suggest this to anyone who has an interest in the Civil War. It really helped me to picture the men there and their struggles, both physical and emotional. I will watch it over and over, in the years to come.
B000002GKT|5.0|What can I say? This is one of those seminal live albums that take me back to my youth. I had this on 8-track (yes, 8 track), then had and lost the CD, so now I have the CD and the mp3 backed up on an external hard drive.<br /><br />This is culled from Humble Pie's performances over several evenings at the old Fillmore East. All of the performances have been released as a download and I sampled the mp3 and found that what's here really is representative of the band's performances which, for the most part, consisted of most of the same songs every performance. In the end, I saved myself some money and just went with this. I mean, seriously, how many times do I need to listen to &#34;I Don't Need No Doctor?&#34; (Great song, but one nice version -- the one here -- is enough.)<br /><br />If you are unfamiliar with this, I highly recommend it. Play it loud. I can still remember driving from Dallas to Memphis back in the '70s with this playing LOUD in my ol' 1974 VW Beetle. Ah, great memories...
B004K4AUZW|5.0|This cd is great. I project a few songs won't make the radio seen, like Hair and Americano but the other songs are great.  It's a must have. Her voice is good, the music is better and her message is clear. She was born to stay, a born winner!!!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|i dled it today just to find an idle icon ending in a non functional app. :( i guess it doesnt work for htc incredible...
0307272702|5.0|This book presents excellent information with plenty of information to back it up.  I began reading with a preconceived idea about the information, and I learned that I needed to change my mind.  Thank you Gary Taubes for writing this book, and for spending so much time putting the information together.
B004SBQALA|4.0|This is a sci-fi movie that everyone could enjoy. It started off with a bang (exciting action), had mystery, a love story, monsters, conflict and ended with a explosion of action! I thought the acting was good enough and the direction adequate. The movie was entertaining and I look forward to the sequel and prequel. However I'm perplexed by one thing. Why were the protectors so weak? The \\"numbers\\" being protected where a lot stronger than the protectors. Make's you wonder . . . .
B0052UZIFA|3.0|game plays OK but gets choppy on a transformer which is weird its got a fricken Tegra 2 inside. would rate higher if in hd
B0041D843M|4.0|I got this book on a suggestion from a friend, who had been following the \\"diet\\" advice in the book for 8 months, and I wanted to see what could possibly convince a person to radically change there life so quickly.    The information contained in this book is excellent, informative, and convincing. It also is very one-sided, and I highly suggest before you make any changes to your lifestyle you take the time to read the well-thought out replies on the internet to this book (a simple google search will turn up lots of them) so you can see both sides of the the interpretation to the data.    With the above in mind, I also found the book very, very repetitive. The author constantly goes over the same or very similar material in a haphazard way that leaves you thinking that you've already read what is being discussed. I feel the book could have been organized a lot better and made the entire read much shorter easier to sit down and digest. It's very factual, and I only found it mildly entertaining to read. I think the excitement over the idea of living a better life is what got me through it, not the actual book itself. This is the only reason I gave the book 4 stars.    Since reading the book (and numerous count-arguments written in reply to the study) I have started moving towards a plant based diet. While I am convinced after reading The China Study that this is the best approach to leading a long and healthy life, I've found it very difficult to adhere to, both practically and socially. Expect to have trouble finding a restaurant to eat at unless you live in a major city. Expect you're friends to think you're nuts as you try to convince them to sit down and read this book. Expect your family to think you're doing something totally unhealthy and unnatural. And expect to have a great conversation piece to go with every healthy meal you eat.    If you are on the fence about reading this book, it is worth every penny it costs (and then some) and the time it takes to read. I am convinced my life (and yours) will be better for it. If nothing else you'll have an excellent understanding of the health problems you are likely to face and some insights as to what may be the cause of them.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Good value, fun game, lots of replay value. I wonder about why it's listed to not work with some devices, such as the OG Droid.<br /><br />Oh, wifi only is LAME. My 4G in Seattle is faster than my home or work download speed.
B00005NNMJ|5.0|This is probably Accept's crowning achievement right here, the aptly titled \\"Balls to the Wall.\\" Udo again is in fine form, the songs flow really well, and the Hermann Frank/Wolf Hoffman guitar duo is practically unstoppable on this go around.  The rhythm section is rock solid, the drums thunderous.  Production has that super-clear 80's loud snare-driven mix that makes the songs snap.  Sometimes Accept's lyrics could be a little strange, but what the hell does it matter when the music and vocals behind it sound this good.  Classics on here include the title track, Head over Heels, London Leatherboys....just about the entire album.  Yes, it is really that good.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|The entire second screen is dedicated to text in between puzzles and there's no voice reading it to you. So if you don't like reading, you won't enjoy it. It reads kind of like a pulp novel which is kinda cool. And since it has multiple endings, it's a little like choose your own adventure books. Entire screens have text like \\"Junpei pushed the door open and it slowly creaked open, its cries echoing down the vacant hallway...\\" It has sound effects for such instances though for dramatic effect. The plot has a lot to do with pseudo-science and myths related to the Titanic, so that was pretty interesting. I have no idea how much that stuff is actually legit though.     The story is kinda like Saw in that Zero (the antagonist) gathers up 9 people, puts them in a sinking ship and makes them solve a bunch of puzzles in order to survive the 9 hour time limit. Saw with puzzles instead of ridiculous death traps. You spend the game looking for the way out: a door marked with the number 9. Along the way you try to piece together who everyone is, why they're all there and what Zero's deal is.    The puzzles are challenging and some are just plain infuriating. These puzzles definitely wouldn't be good for younger kids, neither is the story for that matter, because you need some basic knowledge of science and math for some puzzles. There's one puzzle where you have to count the atoms in molecular formulas. Not every puzzle is like that though, a lot are logic puzzles.    It's a game of reading, puzzles, and more reading and puzzles. If that's ok with you and you're looking for a mystery puzzle game, then this is a pretty great one.
B0012GMYI2|5.0|Accept have always been a favorite of mine.  This album is partly responsible for that, for it is the first recording by Accept I heard.  This album is veritable metal classic, replete with screeching, Brian Johnson-esque vocals from the man Udo, and some good old fashioned gutiar mayhem from Wolf Hoffman.  I know some Euro-metal, at least to me, seems to have a distinct lack of emotion but that is not the case here.  Fast as a Shark, Restless and Wild, Princess of the Dawn, Flash Rockin' Man, all Accept classics.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Laggy beyond use, poorly programmed dialog boxes with blank interfaces. Sound is very choppy and constantly freezes for several seconds at a time. Can't even use this on my Droid Incredible.
B000MR9D5E|1.0|I purchased this dvd for my granddaughter for Christmas 2010.  She has just opened it and there are no discs in the box.!!!  Ugh![[ASIN:B000MR9D5E Planet Earth: The Complete BBC Series]]
140131046X|4.0|Mitch Albom had been raised as a conservative Jew in South Jersey--he even attended a yeshiva as a youth. But after graduating from Brandeis, he considered himself a man on the rise and a \\"citizen of the world.\\" His only gesture to his religious background was to attend the High Holy Day services with his parents at their synagogue, the synagogue of his youth. He had never felt the desire or need to seek out a spiritual home in Detroit, where he was now based.     When the now-retired Rabbi comes to hear the author speak and asks him to give his eulogy, Albom, thinking the rabbi is probably going to die soon, acquiesces and decides he needs to get to know him better. What starts out as an attempt to get background information becomes an important relationship that brings Albom back to his Jewish roots to a questioning extent (and questioning is the quintessential Jewish modus operandi).     Meanwhile, Albom starts a hands-on homeless charity, and investigates a once-beautiful but now ramshackle church run by Henry Covington, an ex-addict, as a possible source for beneficence, as they have a homeless \\"program.\\" Albom is a bit cynical and mistrustful of Covington, having seen a lot of ex-addicts regress to their scamming ways. And the program is anything but traditional--it's about love and trust and acceptance and giving, even if the person being given to is an addict or a thief.     How Albom begins to understand the vertex and the vortex of two very different holy men gives him a \\"connection\\" to his own spiritual beliefs and needs.     I read this book from midnight to 2 a.m., unable to stop reading until I was finished. Albom is one of the most accessible writers alive and I never regret reading his work. Recommended.     Updated to note that Henry Covington died last year. I am grieving a man I never met. RIP
B0049P1VHS|5.0|What a refreshing and entertaining show.  Special effects are exceptional, and the interpersonal relationships create balance and relief between well placed scenes of mayhem.  A little too realistic for some people, especially children, but well made and realistic enough to keep the viewers' belief that anything can happen next.  Nobody is safe from the gross and agressive walkers.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|What can I say about Dexter that hasn't already been said. The show is riveting, the character development is fantastic, and never before have you felt yourself so strongly rooting for the 'bad guy'. MCH's portrayal of Dexter is just awesome. You find yourself loving and hating the other characters (Deb - so strong, but also such a wimp!) and LaGuerta (so awful, but has her good side). One of my faves is Masuka, he's just so dirty.     Just... watch it. Buy it. Stream it on Netflix if you want to check it out before committing to buying a season. But you will want to own it.
B000F9RB8K|5.0|Comment: It is not too often that I use the words \\"great or wonderful\\" to describe a film... but I will when it comes to this one. I can only categorize this movie as a love \\"tragedy\\". This story definitely goes outside the box. Just when you think you know the plot it changes to something completely unexpected. All the characters were played by just the right actors and actresses. The settings were breathtaking. This Blu-ray format is perfect for this type of film taking advantage of \\"spanning vistas\\" and a beautiful canvas of colors. I recommend this film as a \\"mature\\" family film of the highest caliber. I was a little saddened to see it end like it did.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Won't get past the first load screen without it crashing and sending me back to my home screen. Kinda wanted to play this and see if its as good as I've heard, oh well. Maybe they'll have it fixed before I forget all about it.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|In his latest films, George Clooney portrays men who are established in thir career, and yet not content with it.  This role is no different.  Clooney plays Jack, an assassin on the run across Europe.  As others are trying to kill him, Jack finds his way to Rome, Italy and eventually in a small town, tucked away in the mountain.  Jack keeps to himself and spends days surrounded with his daily routine of exercise, book readings about butterflies and visits to a local brothel.  He is also tasked to prepare a custom weapon for his female colleague, and he approaches such task with knowledge and dedication.<br /><br />As Jack realizes that his cover is blown, he is trying to determine his next step.  We start to wonder if Jack is loosing his edge, or if he is gaining access to his long repressed humanity.  Slowly, Jack is determined to find his own path to redemption by retiring from the business and starting over.  It is the violent ending that shatters this story and reminds us that life is short, pretty as a butterfly and often times transformative even if transformation happens too late.<br /><br />There are some beautiful European actresses in this film, all classical beauties.  But I truly enjoyed film's slow pace and director's relish in storytelling.  Movie is apparently made after one of the Martin Booth's books.  I love spy novels, but have never read any of Booth's books.  I think I will try him out so I can compare what is better - a book or a movie....
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works just fine on my HTC Desire Z (G2)...fail to see any problems with the graphics. Never played this game before..glad I did! My home wifi is faster than my &quot;4G&quot; connection so I always download that way....
B000000OA6|2.0|This record has 2 very good songs- Innuendo and The Show Must Go On. In these 2 songs Freddie's voice sounds great. But the rest of the album is weak because Freddie's voice sounds unpowerful and even defected. He sounds like any other ordinary 70's hard rock singer. It's too bad because the tunes are great and shift from 80's pop back to hard rock. Very sad. This record could have been much better if Freddie hadn't been so ill.    Freddie had left behind in this album 2 of his best songs, but the rest of the album is very weak.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|After debating for a while on buying this Ebook at the big price of fifteen bucks, I went ahead and sprung for it, in spite of the middling reviews some people put on here.  I'm no 'starred reviewer' but I just want to say that if you enjoyed book one, you will enjoy book two.  Rothfuss has an unassuming and 'catch you off-guard' wit that I ADORE! I am very glad I bought this second novel and now wait for book three with satisfied patience.<br /><br />To Mr. Rothfuss:  Thanks for creating some of the most memorable characters I've ever read...<br /><br />Happy Scribbling!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|was force closing on my evo when I first downloaded. uninstalled and tried again and works great. so if it's not working on your phone and it's supposed to, try downloading again. fun game. worth the trouble.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Was having a good time yesterday playing this when I was on a serious need for a time waster.  Perfect right?  Fun gameplay, smooth animation, even though load time and shutdown are molasses-slow.<br /><br />Well this morning it greeted me by name as I decided to go further up the levels, but as I started adventure mode, it started teaching me the game all over again and I was back at level 1-1 instead of the 4-something I was at.  This is a serious blow to me wanting to repeat all that time to recreate my progress with a chance that this bug will just strike again...i know this was free but things like this happened in other platforms of this game throughout the years according to some quick searching for a solution; I figure that Pop Cap would have this problem fixed by now...2 stars toll fixed.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is amazing. The phone adaptation of it is amazing, and in my opinion, easier to play than the console versions.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Thank you Amazon for making this game free today.  Works great on my amazing Epic 4g.  All you people with crappy phones shouldn't leave bad rating just because you have a crappy phone
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is one of the most enjoyable, simple-yet-complex gameplay, and polished experiences I have had on a smartphone.  To be fair, I used to love this game on the computer.  I actually feel though that it works out even grander on the touchscreen.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Been wanting to play so happy it was free today it works great on my droid x and who cares if you have to use wifi its free and wifi is everywhere thanks amazon
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Locks up on my gtablet running CM7.  I have to force close it, looks to be a memory usage issue, so I put it on my captivate running cognition.  It reboots the phone every couple of levels, likely because memory issues as well.  They need to go hunting for memory leaks, both of these are reasonably powered Android devices and if it doesn't run on them, it will likely have trouble with most Android devices.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|awesome entertaining levels with many different ways to complete each puzzle. funny graphics and sound to support it. can't wait for the next one to come out!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Everything goes super choppy on the new plant award screen on my evo, but otherwise runs great. Not sure what the hype was all about. The game is polished, though. Edit: After updating my Evo to gingerbread (2.3.3) via the OTA update, exiting PVZ now causes my Sense launcher to reload (the HTC loading scree appears) up exiting. Obviously some sort of memory allocation error.
0802714544|4.0|Le Carre's masterpiece is so layered and so complex that it almost takes two readings to understand. This is the best espionage thriller of them all.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I love this game for PC so I grabbed the app as soon as I saw it. Crashes while loading though.. Droid X
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I loved this game on the XBOX 360 and it's great on the Samsung Epic.  Excellent graphics for a phone game and smooth gameplay.  Some people would 1 star a free app that printed $100 bills.
B003ODL004|2.0|Well, when it was first heard in The Last Samurai, it was different, simple, yet epic. Then it was used again in Batman Begins in a more darker, mysterious and subtle approach. Then, The Dark Knight introduced that same two-note motif in it's most aggressive performance ever. Now, for Inception, well, it's epic again... or is it?    After four soundtracks released with this Two-Note motif approach, you start to wonder if Zimmer is really trying to convince himself that he is still doing something different and creative. As a listener, and a fan of Hans Zimmer, you really feel that this is not different or epic at all, like when it was first heard. In my personal opinion, I find it to be a complete lack of effort from this composer, and it worries me. If you listen to Hans Zimmer's compositions, apart from these two-note motif inspirations, you will find an array of beautifull unique compositions that do not resemble each other (The Lion King, Spirit, Gladiator, Pearl Harbor, Tears of the Sun, King Arthur, POTC: At World's End, The Holiday) and still convey a sense of grandeur and emotion. Even The Da Vinci Code used a bit of this two-note motif prolongation in the masterpiece song Chevaliers de Sangreal. So...     until when are we still gonna be amazed by a two-note prolongation? I really can't say I wanna buy this soundtrack because it's yet another variation on the two-note motif heard already in The Last Samurai, Batman Begins, The Da Vinci Code and The Dark Knight. Since I already have all of these soundtracks, I'm really not interested in hearing it again.    What started out as a good and innovative idea has become, ironically, an excuse for staying in the same comfort zone that worked so well, initially, for The Last Samurai. It's no longer creative nor innovative, it's the contrary: a complete lack of creative thought in the composition process and a very predictable outcome.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I've been playing this game all day!  Highly addictive but it makes my phone really hot and has actually made my phone restart about 7 times today.  Besides that its been great.   Looking forward to a update that fixes this issue. Evo 4G
B0052UZIFA|2.0|The app launched the 1st time, but then crashed on launch the following 5 times.  I was then able to launch it and made it very far in the game only to open it back up and be brought back to the beginning.    Enjoy the game, but not the bugs.  Makes me not want to play again for fear of going back to the beginning.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|A very fun game. However, some of the graphics are a little screwy on my Thunderbolt. For example, the item at the end of each round that gets zoomed in on is very pixelated. Other than that, a great game!
0060594896|4.0|Jack Canfield's (et al) robust volume summarizes of his life long learning and is filled with some fresh perspectives and great reminders of the attributes, character, attitudes and networks that create success. Excellent motivational book and certainly filled with insight. Sometimes Jack leans a bit toward the materialistic aspect of success resulting in a focus on the temporal measures of success \\"justified\\" by reminding the reader that wealth is good because allows one to do honorable works. A slippery slope to be wary of in my opinion. With that caution in mind, a great addition to anyone's bookshelf.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great graphics, awesome sounds, funny, challenging, and all around fun.   I got this when it was the free app of the day on Amazon, but I would gladly pay for it. For $3, if you like &quot;Tower Defense&quot; style games, this is a gem.   Runs perfect on my Evo running gingerbread.
B004EQAVHI|4.0|Consumately directed and acted, and ... extremely depressing! I watched it to see if Keira Knightly is ever less than perfect. She isn't. But I have to ask: what is the point of a story like this?
B0052UZIFA|1.0|this app just crashes during launch on my moto droid. can' get it to work. so i can not give it a good review..
0307887960|4.0|This book was definately an easy read, I was able to read almost 100 pages in just a few hours. Dr. Dukan breaks down each of the four phases clearly and makes it simple to know what you can and cannot eat. I had trouble finding the oat bran, and the first phase (attack) is really difficult to follow, yet the results are worth it. I lost 5 lbs in the first 3 days!
B000W1586S|4.0|I know I like an album when I can listen to most of the songs without having the impulse to skip to the next song (or the one or two after that [or another album]).  With one or two exceptions, everything on this collection is enjoyable to listen to and reflects a 21st-century band with more than a little talent.  I bought the album because I'd heard the band's \\"Boots\\" song (which isn't on \\"Hot Fuss,\\" mind you) and was pleasantly surprised.  Bush's [[ASIN:B00005RVQJ Golden State]] is similar.  No outstanding commercial hits, necessarily, but consistent quality in every song.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I'm addicted! this is not a good time during finals week....but so fun. I love all defense type games. the graphics are cute too.
B004EPZ06G|3.0|The Hangover 2 is a mildly entertaining case of deja vu since a lot of the film is as if Todd Phillips just simply edited the script of the original and replaced the tiger with a monkey and the baby with a monk in a wheel chair. While the wolf pack \\"Phil, Stu and Alan\\" go through similar stages of hell in about the same order as they did in the first. Then when the film realizes it left out Mike Tyson, even he's lazily thrown in there for the hell of it.<br />  Yet, I can't say I kept my eyes off the screen through-out the Hangover 2. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis are a fun trio to hangout with even if the same material all over again is a waste of their talents. But if Phillips decides to make a part 3, he needs to be much more creative than simply just giving us similar situations...in the same order.
0439023483|5.0|Excellent reading which was chosen for the Masters level program I teach for children' lit! The students are reading the third book from. Collins's trilogy!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Richard Armitage makes this series. He is  the perfect choice for the character who, in the book, is forceful, masterful, hard, and capable of great love for one woman. He is also a loving son and a kind brother.    I felt that many people could have played Margaret Hale, and was not too enamored of the actress. She did an okay job acting wise but the character she portrayed to those who read the book is not up to par.  In the book, Margaret, eighteen or nineteen, is often described as queenly, noble, dignified, restrained; she is the softened female version of the masterful Thornton.  You can see her in her middle age becoming like his mother, loving and tough (of course, not as tough as he is). I don't see those qualities in this actress. But it's not a terrible choice. It works. The actress does have the large expressive eyes that Gaskell refers to, and the beautiful mouth.     I was not quite sure why she refused his proposal.  The series did not make it clear enough. The book, of which I have read about half, makes it plain. After she showed her love for him in front of all the world by throwing her arms around him to protect him from the mob, she was ashamed and embarrassed. For those times, that was forward and un-maidenly conduct. So when he came to propose, she felt that he was presuming. She wanted to show him she was not so easily gotten. That's not how she puts it to herself, because she does love him. Her conscious rationale is that she does not love him and that she would have thrown her arms around anyone.    Armitage is perfection, as he stalks about frowning. When we and Margaret first meet John Thornton, he is beating the you know what out of some worker. That is not in the book, but it is a master stroke by the series' producers. At one point in the series, Margaret is feeling that Milton is \\"hell\\" and then we see John, as if there is a link between him and that place. Thornton, in the series, continually has an air of suppressed violence and restrained passion. Seems like he could do anything at any moment - but he won't. And therein lies the secret of the attraction of the alpha male in fiction. Edward could drink Bella's blood, but he won't. What we want is restrained violence. Why such a character is so devastatingly attractive even in this feminist age (and the more liberated we become, the more the fictional male becomes like that, it's the secret to the success of British historical dramas), I will leave to psychologists to explain.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book was so hard to put down because I just had to know what happened next! As a mother, I truly understand where the character \\"Ma\\" was coming from. Very good read.
0553582445|5.0|I stayed up until 2:00 in the morning to finish this book.  It was so nice to get back with Fitz, Nighteyes, and the Fool.  I really missed them.  Robin Hobb rehashes some of the happenings from the Assassin books which was a good thing for me because it brought back the memories.  I think one would miss quite a bit in the Tawny books if one did not read the Assassin books. I enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the next one.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Its an okay port. The animations are pretty fluid and the interface is what you would expect but the only complaint I have is that the game suffers graphically wide and feature wide from the original pc version. A suggestion would be to add the vs mode from the ps3 version and use wifi to do online matches. But all in all a 4 for this app but semi poorly ported because of programming within the application itself.
B00511ONPG|5.0|I responded to a request from the author to review this book.  And I am really glad I did.<br /><br />I, like most marketing professionals honest enough to admit it, am constantly trying to better understand how to use new platforms like Facebook, Twitter and other \\"social\\" networks in marketing.  While I had heard some of what is covered in this book before, there is a lot I had not, and Dave's writing style is easy to digest and learn from as I went through the book.<br /><br />Highlights for me were the sections on:<br /><br />\\"Likes are more important than links\\" and how a strong Facebook strategy can drive a lot of traffic and attention to your core messages.  Ten years ago, it was all about building a web site, optimizing for SEO and driving cross linkages.  Dave makes some great arguments about how a holistic approach to Facebook can drive far more reception and attention to your core marketing efforts today.  Interesting and thought-provoking.<br /><br />\\"The Brilliance of the Facebook News Feed\\" and the pages on how Edgerank works to drive notice of your messages and how it all works together around likes, time of day, etc, etc.  Very clear explanation of how Facebook algorithms work, and what this means to a marketing pro.  These few pages are must reads!<br /><br />And the areas around creating your company's own Facebook presence; what works and what doesn't; etc are all thought-provoking and already causing some discussions inside our own company about our strategy for Facebook and how we should (and should NOT) use this as part of our overall efforts.<br /><br />Great book.  Well written.  Must have for anyone trying to navigate Facebook and understand how to better apply it in the marketing mix.  I'm sharing three more copies with others on my team.<br /><br />Gary Lee<br />CEO, mBLAST<br />[...]
B0052UZIFA|3.0|This is a good game but it pauses radomly while im playing and goes to a loading screen. Does anyone else have this problem?
B002TXZRRM|5.0|I have read all the books in this series and really enjoyed them. One of the things I love about this author, in everything he writes, is that he can explore real issues and write a thoughtful, meaningful book without all the pretentiousness, downbeat elements and consciously elevated writing that so many \\"literary\\" writers seem to go for. This is a real soap-box issue for me. Sometimes I like a really escapist read, but sometimes I want a book that makes me think, yet does this have to mean I must plough through all this dense writing and catatonic characters who are so alienated and never seem to behave like normal human beings? Surely not! Alexander McCall Smith has a wonderful humanity and lightness of touch. I recommend his work to anyone who is looking for that kind of in-between read - life-affirming and thought-provoking without being a chore to wade through.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Absolutely wonderful if you want to have a book to read,  anytime, anywhere. I have this on my tablet and it works great! Sure, it doesn't have all the features of a Kindle, if that is what you desire, you should probably buy a Kindle! THANK YOU, AMAZON!!!!!
B000002IJA|5.0|When I first heard this album it brought me back to the day to when I was in high school and I was listening to the radio and AC/DC'S shook me all night long came on and I rocked it in my room.  The other songs are good too.  Thank you again.  I would buy from them again.
B00062RCBW|5.0|NOTE: This review is of the ORIGINAL, 2002-2004 *collection* of boxed DVD sets of each of the show's 7 seasons, NOT the *newer*, \\"all-in-one-green-green-box\\" 2007-released set. That NEWER set is said to be of *significantly* INFERIOR quality, both in packaging and in dvd quality.<br /><br />As anyone considering buying this set (obviously) already knows that they enjoy watching Star Trek The Next Generation, I won't bother to review the show itself but rather this particular collection of DVD boxed sets. As far as the show itself goes, suffice it to say that even though the original airing of the last episode in the last  7th) season occurred in 1994, at least as of 2009 it was *still* rated as the most-watched science fiction television series even in RERUN syndication. Star Trek The Next Generation is arguably not only the best of all of the Star Trek television series, but is also considered by many to be the finest science fiction television series IN GENERAL produced to date.<br /><br />First, the packaging of this set - it's absolutely FABULOUS! I cannot POSSIBLY overstate how GOOD the packaging is. Each season is packaged in its own box. Within each box is a well-crafted dvd \\"holding case\\" that FOLDS OUT to display all of that season's dvd's. Each dvd is held tightly in place, and when the set's folded up it fits PERFECTLY into the season's larger box. The boxes are of TREMENDOUSLY high quality, clearly manufactured to the highest standards. The boxes are made of VERY heavy-weight, well-fitting paper/cardboard but with some sort of polished and plasticized exterior finish to ensure exceptionally long life. The graphics and color scheme reflect the original design schemes of the tv series itself. Imprinted on the interior of each box's front cover is a listing of that season's/set's dvd's and the title of each episode on each dvd (including special/bonus features). Between the quality of each season's exterior box and the interior dvd holding case, the packaging will protect the dvd's - and the packaging's printing - pretty much FOREVER.<br /><br />Also - Within EACH season's box is a fold-out brochure that lists each episode of that season's set by title, original airdate, \\"Stardate\\" (!), and disc/dvd number, as well as a brief description of that season's special/bonus features. The first season's brochure also includes an introduction to the collection by Executive Producer Rick Berman and a photo and brief description of the show's regular characters. Subsequent seasons' brochures include brief but interesting notes on that particular season, and a few little-known but interesting facts about the show and/or its characters. The final season's boxed set brochure includes a message from Mr. Berman thanking all fans for their continued loyalty to the series. Each season's fold-out disc case has a special sleeve for long-term safe storage of that season's brochure, and the sleeve can also accommodate that season's boxed set's external packaging information sheet if you wish to safely store it there.<br /><br />The physical dvd's - Again, EXCELLENT manufacturing quality. The imprinted label of each dvd is graphically matched to the series' design, and color-matched to that season's dvd color scheme. Each has imprinted on it the season number, disc number, and the title and official episode number (!) of each episode on that disc. Each disc is held tightly in its place in the dvd holder and is appropriately *thick* so that it will not bend excessively when pulled off of its holder. Each disc's holder has a plastic push-button \\"spindle\\" that when pushed in makes releasing the disc very easy, and each spindle's \\"prongs\\" are thick enough that they will not break off upon repeated use.<br /><br />The series' AUDIO quality - Each dvd has both a regular, 2-channel stereo track and a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround track, selectable from each EPISODE'S main title screen OR your dvd player's audio control buttons/menus, whichever you prefer. The audio quality is EXCELLENT in EITHER format. If your a/v setup doesn't include Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround capability but your dvd player and/or tv has a \\"simulated\\" surround setting and/or an enhanced \\"stereo separation\\" setting (sometimes referred to as \\"SRS\\" or the like) you'll still get EXCELLENT audio quality out of the 2-channel audio track with no audible background \\"hiss\\" or distortion; the musical and audio effects' soundtracks consistently sound clear and distinct, with very good frequency distribution and dynamic range. There is no \\"audio commentary\\" track for any of the episodes.<br /><br />The series' VIDEO quality - Is generally EXCELLENT, particularly given the manner in which the television series was filmed, composited and transferred from film to video to begin with. The episodes were apparently given a \\"lite\\" restoration. The episodes are presented in their original standard-definition \\"full-screen\\" aspect ratio. As such, picture quality is best when you have your dvd player set to \\"up-convert\\" to 420p and connected to a high-definition tv (preferably a plasma or an lcd that has full-array LED backlighting with local dimming, due to the importance of black level depth and retention in this particular television series). When you have such a tv set and dvd player, color balance from scene to scene and episode to episode is generally very good, as are the collection's inherent contrast and black levels. When your set's color, contrast, brightness and sharpness settings are set correctly, many of the scenes and shots actually look as if they're in high definition - no kidding! BUT - there are also many (brief) moments when the series' age and *original* manner of film-to-video transfer are evident with momentary shots that appear more blurred and slightly grainier. But overall, video quality is very good to excellent.<br /><br />Overall, *this particular* set's video and audio quality is CONSIDERABLY better than anything you're likely to get from any OTA, cable or satellite channel for sure!<br /><br />DVD program structure -<br /><br />When you first load a dvd, once you get past Paramount Home Video's copyright screen you're presented with a brief but BEAUTIFULLY-presented video collage of the series' main characters set against a stunning starfield background, the Enterprise then dashes across the screen, while the series' musical theme plays. You're then taken directly to the dvd's main title (\\"root menu\\") screen while the musical theme continues (in a loop, of course). Each dvd's main title screen has colorful, animated graphics that are beautifully rendered and consistent with the series' general graphic design scheme; it also includes a rotating sequence or collage of brief scenes from each of the episodes on that dvd. Episode titles and their original episode numbers (!) are presented for playback selection, but there is no option to have all episodes on the disc automatically play sequentially. Once an episode is selected you can then choose from \\"Engage\\" (play), \\"Communications\\" (selection of which version of stereo audio you want, and whether or not you want subtitles - English is the only language available), \\"Chapter Log\\" (the episode's chapter markers), or \\"Return\\" (to the dvd's root menu).<br /><br />Each season's set has its bonus features on its last disk; most are quite good, informative, and add value to the set.<br /><br />And each episode on each and every disc plays back PERFECTLY, without ANY skips, stalls, freezes or breakups.<br /><br />In summary, in spite of this being an older dvd set without a few of the more \\"advanced\\" features that most newer dvd's in general offer (such as multiple language subtitles and sequential autoplay of all episodes on a dvd), *this particular*, older studio release is an INCREDIBLE and the BEST collection of all 7 seasons of Star Trek The Next Generation, FAR superior to the newer single boxed set in virtually ALL respects. Given that the (albeit inferior) newer boxed set has been out now for awhile, in all likelihood this older yet SUPERIOR \\"boxed-by-season\\" set will continue to be available ONLY until distributor warehouse and retailer supplies are exhausted. Consequently, some retailers are offering this particular complete set for over $1,000!!! Here on Amazon you can get it, as of this writing, new for $249.99 - with free Super Saver shipping - via newbury_comics (a very reputable retailer) with \\"Fulfillment By Amazon\\"  but as of this writing they have only 12 of these sets left available... Oops! Make the 10 now (although they may be able to get more that's not really likely, and other retailers have stock left but at significantly higher prices due to its declining availability).<br /><br />This TRULY is a SPECTACULARLY BEAUTIFUL \\"Collector's Edition\\" set that *NO* STNG fan will want to be without. I have a number of \\"Collector's Edition\\" TV series dvd sets, but THIS one is BY FAR the most STRIKINGLY beautiful set of them all - if I had a locked vault to store it in, believe me I'd do so - it's THAT beautiful of a set.<br /><br />Given the VERY real likelihood that a forthcoming Blu Ray set will be extremely expensive, and that this DVD collection is a FAR superior set and package than the newer one currently out, if you want the BEST STNG collection and DON'T order this one VERY soon you *WILL* regret it. So order it, and order it NOW!!!<br /><br />5 STARS ALL THE WAY!!!<br /><br />6/16/2011 UPDATE: Be sure to read the COMMENTS posted to this review for the latest on this series' anticipated Blu Ray release!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Hi<br /><br />After purchase it arrived very quickly.<br /><br />I and my family really enjoyed this movie & I recommend it to everyone. It has fantastic values which we all need to learn if we dont already practice them.<br /><br />cheers<br />Thaddeus
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Jamie McGuire is the \\"next big thing\\" in literature.  She is an amazing writer that knows how to keep the reader on the edge of their seat wanting to know what is going to happen next.  Beautiful Disaster was a book that I could not put down.  Travis and Abby are the type of couple that everyone wants to be and their love for each other is intense and McGuire makes you feel every inch of the passion that the couple has for each other.  Although the relationship between the two wasn't always the best for them, their love for each other overcame everything.  The character of Travis is one that will have girls falling in love with him because he is so sincere yet so frustrating at the same time.  The reader will find themselves cheering the couple on, page after page.  After reading this book and the author's other book \\"Providence\\" I would sincerely bet that Jamie McGuire's writing will one day be the next Hollywood Big HIt Movie that everyone is going crazy over like \\"Twilight\\".
0425242099|5.0|I never write reviews but I thought I would jump on to give my quick thoughts. I loved this book! I was a little disappointed with the last couple of books in the series, I love following the changelings and the whole Pys side only doesn't do it for me as much. Kiss of Snow was similar to the books in the beginning of the story. It is pricey, but it was worth it!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Great game,  sloppy port. It crashes during half of my game sessions, and it's a bad crash: I have to rip out the battery. Framerate is also bad part of the time, even when no other apps are running. When the game actually works it's great, but the frustration isn't worth it.
031261246X|5.0|Mark Russinovich does a tremendous job with this book.  I work in the Information Technology field and the story is excellent.  He does a great job capturing what a few very smart, nefarious people can do.  Should be a wake up call to the security industry. From a story perspective, it flows very well and is truly an enjoyable read.  His expertise in this field clearly comes through, but he does it in a way that the casual reader can understand.  I highly recommend this book.
B003ODL004|4.0|The album although as I suppose with many artists is a take off of previous work or inspirations, and since Hans Zimmer has had some good inspiration over the last few years, I was personally happy to see it extended onto this album and this movie.    Now my BIG gripe:  What really charged me up about this movie was the spectacular trailers and especially the amazing music for them.  And like the Dark Knight soundtrack to a lesser extent where it not only lacked the expansion of some of the key emotional crescendos we heard all over the previews, but for the Inception soundtrack it lacked the music altogether.  How could the 2 minute track with the dramatic tuba (I'm guessing) bursts timed to somewhat misleading, mysterious and ominous video be missing from this CD?  It REALLY boggles my mind....  There are untold numbers of re-cut and remixed videos and trailers on YouTube set to this music as a testament to its inspiration to others.    I agree that there is plenty of similar sounding music and other amazing emotional, leading, crashing and diving tracks, but what kept this from 5 stars to me is the missing trailer music track.  Not the be outdone, I downloaded the best version of the song supposedly from Zack Hemsey I could find from the inter-webz, added it back to the CD and re-burned with the bonus tracks for a total of 15 tracks (which I'm tempted to `share' just punish the producers for such a bizarre oversight...)    In the end its a great movie, full of things to keep me re-watching it for the action or the unanswered questions or just the emotional content of a man wanting his family back after he made a terrible unknowing error in judgment, and the soundtrack is right behind that, bringing me back to different parts of the movie, but with just that one disappointment that cost me some frustration with studio.      If you liked the movie and how it made you feel, then this CD was replicate that while you drive, exercise or do other things not next to a TVor DVD player (or BluRay player if you're fancy ;)
0061997811|5.0|This book is a great resource not just for fans of the Harry Potter series but for movie fans in general.  With interesting behind-the-scenes stories and photos as well as interviews with the cast and crew, Harry Potter Film Wizardry gives a fascinating overview into what it takes to bring an epic series of films to life. As an extra bonus, paper prop replicas of Harry's Hogwarts acceptance letter, a ticket to the Yule Ball, and \\"product catalogs\\" from wizarding companies such as Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes are included within the pages, making this a must-have for all avid Harry Potter fans.

B004LZRSDM|5.0|Great to re-live the final concert in Oslo. We were seated far away, but video gives us close up views.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Fun game with decent graphics and very addictive, no freeze issues. The zombies are hilarious! Great way to pass the time if you are waiting in a doctors office or for any other appointment.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works great on the droid x. Loads fast and game play is smooth. This game is a great time killer.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Deborah Harkness takes care to develope each character.expertly positions each before taking the reader on a fun ride through the supernatural
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I loved it... I managed to finish the book in less then 24 hours... I love how it ended it had a real bonnie and clive feeling... It kinda felt like that was the start instead of the end, like there is so many more stories that can come from them!!     The story just came alive as i was reading it, just like i was part of the it...
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Once I got to the first night level the game would freeze and crash every single time. It was fun before that but now its unusable.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|If you are after that \\"thump-thump\\" kind of exaggerated sound don't buy these. The K240 headphones are \\"accurate\\" and don't add anything to the sound.  People who are mixing or editing sound prefer \\"accurate\\" but many music listeners prefer the accentuated bass.  These headphones let you hear what is on the track an add nothing to that.  The sound is transparent, as if you were not wearing headphones.  Also being \\"semi-open\\" this means they do not block sound in either direction.  This open design adds to the not-wearing-headphones sound but is not practical in some settings.  Remember these are STUDIO headphones.  They provide accurate sound for engineers and are best used in a quiet studio setting.  If you are a music listener at home then the best use of these headphones is for classical or jazz in a quiet living room.  or for critical listening to any music, for example recently I was trying to listen to Paul McCarney's bass guitar lines in some new and old recordings. With these I can hear every note and also how he played the strings with his fingers.  The K240 provide an accurate, reserved sound for that kind of listening, not the popular flashy and thumpy sound.<br /><br />Serious headphone users will find they need several pair but one pair should be these.
B004SKIPXW|4.0|There's no question, in my mind, why this movie got bad reviews. No professional critic would ever give this film a good review for fear of the fallout from those that would find it deeply offensive.    In spite of the lack of any real moral high ground, I give credit to those involved for being brave enough to create such a film. I find it surprising this didn't garnish an X rating. Not just for the nudity and sexual content, which is the most I've seen in a long while, but for the level of violence which defines this work.    I docked it a star on a few points. Some of the effects were pretty; well; faky, unrealistic and downright silly. Not a huge factor in light of the premise and genre, but enough.    The acting was OK. William Fichtner, as previously noted, is good as the accountant, adding his usual flare with a few twists. Cage is promisingly not annoying or arrogant. His gun fighting is top notch and cool, as is the car action.    Don't watch this if you're sensitive to graphic violence because this movie is all about violence and evil for it's own sake. There are no men in white hats here.
0316069884|5.0|I've read about half of this book so far.  It really details how animals are raised or harvested (seafood).  I've read other books like In Defense of Food (focus was more on plant foods), which touch upon some of these topics, but this book details it much more.  So far this is not a nutritional guide.  It does not promote nor deter vegetarianism.  It simply details factory farming and where other animals we consume come from.  Other things I've read, offer similar stories.  While the general public is not allowed inside factory farms, I'm willing to bet a lot of this book is truthful as I've read other similar documentation.  It's sad to think that most Americans are left in the dark on where animal products come from.  We are so far removed from what we are eating when we order a meal at a steak house.  There are no bones in our meat, we never saw where the cow lived.  What did that cow eat?  Did the cow live on a pasture and eat grass?  Did the cow live with no room to walk in front of a corn trough?  Was the cow indoors it's whole life or go outside?  Did the picture of the red barn house on the milk container actually exist?  I recently told someone I thought cows shouldn't eat corn in my opinion.  \\"Why?\\" they asked.  \\"Well, what does a cow eat?\\" I asked back...  \\"corn?\\" they said.  Think about it...  when you think of cow in your mind, where is it?  In a corn field?  In a green pasture?  What are we doing to factory farmed animals?
B0013IKUIK|5.0|I love this album.    Maybe you will, maybe you won't... I guess it depends on what you want your listening experience to be.    Its all about what you want out of an album.  You pry won't be dancing much to this one.     This album is beautiful, there really is no argument there, its gorgeous and pure.    Much of the lyrics on the album are undecipherable.  Bon Ivers voice is really the main instrument here  and if you've missed that, you have missed the point.  The point is atmosphere and soul, at least thats what I feel.       Its a really nice addition to anyones record collection, and if you have a record player, get it on vinyl, you wont  regret it.     Bon Iver is like a fine wine, he only gets better with age.     To the haters that gave it one star, my guess is you'd rather listen to Dave Mathews Band or Jack Johnson.
B004DMIIO6|4.0|For the Modern Japanese Martial Arts Film Aficionado, Visually it was like watching Cashern (makes sense since it was the same director) with a Robin Hood like twist. Its Fantasy Medieval Japan with western Knight Armor. It is very CGI heavy with action sequences that look like it could only really happen in Anime. Like  most Asian Action Films these days its filled with action humor and tragic situations. If you liked \\"Dagger of Kamuei\\" , \\"Cashern\\" and \\"Shinobi\\" then you should probably go watch this. Im a huge Supporter of the Genre (so naturally I am biased) and I don't really think this film is for everyone but I am a Japanese martial arts film junkie and I rank it up there with Dagger of Kamui and Shinobi. I don't want to Spoil anything so you arent going to find Spoilers in this review. Not a movie for those that expect the film too take itself to seriously because even though some of the situations in the film are quite intense it is offset by action sequences that are too fantastic to believe such as jumping from roof top to roof top without breaking a sweat.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Addicting game. Hours of fun. It's a Popcap game so you know it's good. The price is right for this awesome zombie home defense game.
0670022411|1.0|Read this novel based on a review in the newspaper.  Pretty much a disappointment.  Diana flips back and forth between being a strong woman and a romantic novel heroine given to fits of the vapors.  She falls to pieces regularly and needs to be supported by her bossy vampire/man.  Not too many likable characters.  Even the lesbian (?) witch aunts who start out pretty good, descend into tediousness pretty quickly.  All in all, way too long and a disappointment.  Don't waste your time.
0307408833|1.0|No matter how much time or money you spend on a nice layout for your book, that's not really going to mean much if the recipes are disingenuous.  Many, if not all of these recipes do not come out like the items in the shop.  I, for one, think the stuff in the shop is very good, but not spectacular like many claim. So in most cases, I'd just skip this book, although a few items are probably ok.  The best tip I can give to is buy quality baking products (good vanilla, flour, etc), that'll get you further than obscure ingredients or celebrity cookbooks.  Because I, too, think some of these are false recipes, it gets one star.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Play the game no-stop for 5 hours right after I got it. Why? Because I want to see if it has the survival mode with endless. I was extremely disappointed when I found out the truth. Hope PopCap will include it into the future updates...
0316044695|5.0|While I have always been a great admirer of the military, my father served in WWII, I was completely changed by this book.  Very hard to put down, and at times, very hard to continue reading.  I great story of survival, but more than that, it is about those who died....their selfless honor and sacrifice.  I will never forget them.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Fun game but it constantly locks up and freezes on the gtablet forcing you to force quit the application and then restart.  Having to replay the level it locked up on has gotten tiresome.  When they fix this issue it will be a great app.
0425242099|5.0|For those of you who have no idea what this Psy/changeling series is or who have just never taken the time to try it, well now is your time to get caught up! You will have ten books to feast on. Trust me they are such a delicious read.        Throughout other books we have gotten a taste of who Hawke is but in this book we find out about his past. I loved reading about why his wolf is so close to the surface and the reason he became alpha at fifteen. Even though the story was sad it was necessary for he and Sienna to fit together. After reading Kiss Of Snow I see Hawke in a whole new light. Is it wrong to be jealous of Sienna when she's not a real person?        Sienna had for some reason always come across as snotty to me. I could not have been more wrong! Being taken away at five, going silent by age nine, and  the things Ming did to her as a child. It made my heart break for her as she finally broke down and told her story. Sienna is an amazing woman, I knew she was an X-Psy but I honestly had no idea what that would mean. How tormented her life was by that designation.          Most of the story is spent with Hawke and Sienna. I was worried at how she would work out the age difference, but it was handled beautifully. Even though Sienna is nineteen she has had to be an adult for some time. After Hawke caught up with reality no one has a problem with the age gap. I really enjoyed the fact that Nalini Singh wrote their love out slowly, allowing Hawke and Sienna to get to know each other on a different level since he has been her alpha for so long. I loved that they played games because Sienna had never played as a child. There dance was beautiful.        There were a few side stories going on as well. Lukas and Sasha have their baby. As the characters from the first book you always want to know what is happening in their world. Also Walker (Sienna's uncle) and Lauren (the SnowDancer Pack's healer) have a very sweet romance going that end in their own mating Dance.         Through all of this the war that has been brewing between the Changelings and the Psy has begun. Thus the action in this book is high as well. There were just no low points for me.        If you can't tell I loved it!    Happy Reading,    Rebecca  [...]
B004X2M3SI|4.0|This season of Doctor Who is dark, mysterious and borders on the horror genre more than science fiction! Though I love Doctor Who and I enjoyed Season 5 with Matt Smith (his first season as Doctor Who), I can't help but feel like this season--so far--does not live up to previous seasons.<br /><br />UPDATE: Please note the blame for Episode 6 not being uploaded is not with Amazon but with BBC, which has also decided to postpone the episode on BBC America despite already airing it in the UK.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I got this GPS watch back in September 2010.  I use it at least once a week, mostly for hiking, not running or biking.  It's a useful little gaget.  Sometimes I get frustrated with it because it tickles the ideas of so much more that it could do if fully reliable/prorammed.    Pros  -Up to 4 customizable display screens where I can choose to display 3 fields to display the ~40 metrics the watch keeps on my workout (Current Pace, Average Pace, Pace last lap, etc.)  -Relatively small (I know some might quible about this and smaller would be better but I remember doing field research with a GPS device in the 1990s that was less accurate and weighed about 3 pounds.)  -Pairs with lots of other gagets - heart rate monitors, foot pads, etc  -Hey, it's a tiny little GPS device on your wrist!!  It's just fun knowing all these details about a work out I used to have to guess at or spend a great deal of time trying to calculate  -Garmin website where all your activities are downloaded and comparable, trackable, etc    Cons  -Battery is flaky.  Specs promise 8 hrs, I rarely get 6 hours.  I feel silly quibling about this too since my old research GPS ate ~10 AA batteries a day but it's annoying.  I wish there was a better, smaller battery that lasted longer  -Watch does not turn off and thus eats its short battery life even when you don't want it to.    -I must remember to turn GPS 'off' to save battery life.  If I accidently leave GPS 'on' while driving to my hiking start point, I can use up 30-50% of the battery life before even starting my work out.  -Poor downloading of activities.  The ANT transfer fails a lot of the time.  I get frequent error messages requesting I send stuff to Garmin Technical Support.  They help but it's annoying to have to go thru this process.  I just want a reliable transfer.  I recently hiked the Grand Canyon and cannot for the life of me get that work out to transfer to my computer.  I can see it on the watch but the computer refuses to download it.  The watch won't give elevation info on past works outs - only the computer will.  Not being able to see this special activity is obnoxious.  -It doesn't like slow people.  Since this is designed for runners and bikers it seems to have a hard time tracking slower paces.  Even when I'm fairly confident I'm hiking a consistent pace, the watch will vary from 15:00 min mile to 25:00 min mile - so it's tough for me to know.  Overall average pace is more reliable than current pace.  -Distances are not particularily accurate.  My 405CX consistently gives different distaces than those posted or those on my hiking partners Garmin 410 forerunner.  Someone isn't correct.  (FYI  The 405CX's distances are less than those posted.  The 410's distances are less than 405CX's)  -Garmin website now uses Bing maps instead of google maps.  Bing's are worthless compared to google.  I can't figure out how to get it to switch back.    -Garmin website defaults to making all your workouts and details public.  I'm still not sure if I've set everything to private or not - there's more than one setting.  Hey Garmin, some privacy please!!!  -Display changes even when you don't touch the watch in ANY way.   It sorta has a life of its own at times.  It goes to the navigation screen all the time without being asked.  Other times it seems determined to show the clock instead of my workout screen.  -Banner displays pop up on watch screen and won't go away.  For example when it's detects a heart rate monitor it beeps at you and displays a reminder accross the screen.  There's no way to get the reminder to go away leaving the screen unreadable for 15-30 seconds.  If you work out with other Garmin people, this can get tedious, as it goes around 'detecting' everyone else's gagets constantly.  -It reminds you continuously when your battery life is going down.  I'm on the trail, what do you want me to do about it?  There are no outlets!!  It seems like it wastes quite a lot of its remaining battery beeping at me every 10 minutes telling me it's about to die.    Anyway, I've rambled enough.  It's a fun gaget but what it can do reminds me of all the things it can't do or doesn't do well yet.  I'm hoping Garmin continues to improve its offerings.  Having this level of detail is just awesome!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I'm glad to see that we are now getting quality apps from quality developers on Android!  I will buy future games just to support this kind of development!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|First off, kudos to Amazon for making this the free app of the day.<br />This game is so much fun, easy to pick up and learn, EXTREMELY difficult to put down. Who doesn't love a good zombie game?<br />Even at $1.50 this game is well worth the money and will keep you entertained for hours!
0316056863|5.0|I thank this book for my recovery from a terrible 100F fever. In a very Fey-styled funny way, Tina Fey accurately described how a female works in a male dominated world. Her story is very encouraging for people who want to pursue a career in improv, acting, writing, managing, or anything you can think of that requires hard work and talents.   You definitely need to work hard even if you have talents.   You definitely need to show your talents at the right moment to the right people after years of years of hard-working preparation.   You definitely need to have a comedian heart to laugh or make fun of many unfair realities.   Oh yes, she touched on these many tough serious issues in life, but you will laugh line after line, page after page. It's a real entertainment reading this book while getting some hard-core life-experience education!  Get the book and read it cover to cover and send it to your best friends to read. Tell them to do the same before recycle it for other purposes.  Enjoy!
0743201140|4.0|I want to acknowledge Hines Books for going the extra mile to satisfy a problem with my order. No one is perfect and I appreciate that Hines Books responded to my request immediately and resolved the problem to my satisfaction.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Opened this not really expecting to like it but I quickly found it entertaining and challenging. Good mindless fun! Lol
0811875555|5.0|This book is no disappointment: it is packed with top notch development art. What an excellent resource for animation students, BG painters, concept artists, and fans alike. It's worth the investment for just the Glen Keane drawings alone.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Beautiful Disaster is enchanting. I could not put the book down. I just had to know what happened to Travis and Abby. I hope she tells the story of Sheply and his girl. I am waiting for the arival of her next book.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Get this as soon as possible. I spent a ton of money to build a home theater and this movie makes that investment pay huge dividends. the rodgers and hammersten  score is infectious.  and the austrian background is cinematically breath taking. Julie andrew and christopher plummer are as mmagical on screen as bill holden annd kim novac in picnic. The children are on screen just enough and never a pain in the caboose. this movie will leave you whistling doe ray me.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I have added a new name to my favorite author list. Jamie Mcguire writes in such a way that it makes it hard to put the books down. I loved beautiful disaster as much if not more than providence. I can't wait for requiem in 9 days! The characters have good back stories and personalities that make you feel like you really know them. Plus who doesn't love a bad-ass tough guy that has a good heart and a smart girl with some attitude. I would love to see either book made into a movie of some sort. ps I have read and re-read this book about 15 times since I purchased it!!!!!!!!! yeas it's that good!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Runs great on Samsung Continuum, but keeps erasing game progress. I have gone as far as 2-2 before it reset to first level. It's frustrating. I will not recommend this till this issue is fixed. Deleting game now.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|It's a great port to android. What would be great is if it had a couple exclusives like, oh I dunno a zen garden or something else from the pc version.  If they brought back the MJ zombie I'd buy a copy for any of my friends that wanted it. 4 stars Epic4G
B004K4AUZW|5.0|I don't know why this is, but when I try to convince people that Lady Gaga is actually good no one pays attention because I'm a crazy fan of hers. But seriously, one thing is being a fan, another is knowing it's good. I'm a fan of High School Musical and I know the movies suck and I can't say no to that... But Gaga is completely different.<br /><br />Born This Ways is a ride through Gaga's mind, seeing things from her political views to her love for fashion and her experiences as a rebellious teenager. Born This Way, the song, as she describes it, is a gateway drug to the album. It's an amazing pop song, with fresh beats and very literal lyrics (critics say that's not good, but they also say lyrics that are to hard to understand aren't good either...) Marry The Night, a very probable single, is a fantastic up-beat piece with incredible vocals - one of my favorites, just like Hair is, which is about Gaga's struggle as a young woman to free herself through her hair and her parents not letting her. Other Gaga classics include Schei&szlig;e and second single Judas (which might not have gotten a lot of attention, but that I find very interesting and great, especially the way she puts her cheating boyfriends into the Judas betrayal story).<br />But I can't restring myself to the now-usual (and updated) Gaga songs. The album is made of many new sounds like The Edge of Glory, a song released as a promotional single, that rose to number one in several iTunes stores worldwide, making itself the official third single. The tune is a sort of ballad that sounds amazing just with a piano and her voice, but that with the whole Gaga-Fernando Garibay (remember Fernando from the 'Alejandro' lyrics? He produced the fan-favorite 'Dance in the Dark') production shows a complete new leveled Lady Gaga, with huge vocals and even a solo by Clarence Clemons from The E Street Band.<br />Also Government Hooker, featuring Gregorian chants, and that is about people knowing things are wrong in the political system, but not doing anything because it gives them money. Another remarkable songs include Fashion of His Love, MJ-liked to my ear, about Alexander McQueen; Highway Unicorn (Road to Love) with mad vocals and great variations in the song; Black Jesus ' Amen Fashion, a very electro-driven song, I'd say; and possibly Americano, which I don't like at all but can recognize that it is a very fresh kind of tune, with a latin music thing going on and a strong message.<br />The never forgotten ballad of the album is Yo&uuml; and I, which sang live sounds incredible, but that with the electric guitar playing in the background makes it even more amazing. I could say what the song is about, but she doesn't want people to know (I'm sure you'll easily find the inspiration with a little Google-ing, if you want to).<br /><br />I hope this is enough for you to get the CD, but if it isn't, I'm sorry. I tried my best to show you how Born This Way isn't some kind of ordinary, forgettable album; it's a pop masterpiece, with a whole lot of rock, jazz and electro influences, setting The Fame Monster as background. So get it, because I'm pretty sure you'll be less cultured if you haven't heard this piece of art.t not doing anything because it gives them money.

B004RQVVGU|5.0|Diary of a Madman is a Top 10 alltime classic metal album. Randy Rhoads at his mercurial best and sadly the last album recorded before his untimely death.  This version has excellent sound quality and the bonus live disc makes this a great bargain. The best songs on this album are Diary of a Madman, Over The Mountain, Flying High Again, Believer, SATO, and You Cant Kill Rock and Roll. The live disc allows you to hear this version of the band in all their live glory. Do yourself a favor and get this version of the album. Great sound quality for a great album.
B004RKXN44|5.0|I've been waiting for this story since I started reading the Psy Changeling series and it was worth the wait!    I knew Sienna and Hawke would not be like other couples; he had a lot to overcome because he lost his mate while he was still a child and she knew just how dangerous being an X-Psy was to everyone around her. He thought she was too young and she thought he hated her - talk about starting with strikes against you!    This is the love story that we've all been expecting, I've read some of the reviews and I think some of us have built it so high in our minds that we would never be satisfied. I knew that Sienna and Hawke were made for each other, I knew they would be together. I just didn't know how but the resolution is great. All of this happened during one of the most dangerous periods of Psy Changeling history and it was definitely a tense, thrilling storyline along with the love story.     I loved the second thread of this story and catching up with the other characters is always fun. I wouldn't change a thing!    The more I read this series, the more I realize just how complex Silence is and how much effort Ms. Singh puts into her character development and the Psy/Changeling world itself. We get more history with each book, getting information in segments helps me remember it, well done!  I feel as if I am there watching the action, when I'm reading these books, I can see the characters and the forests. I'm living it with them!     Now, I can't wait until I find out who the \\"Ghost\\" is - I have an idea but who knows, if I'm right! Keep them coming Ms. Singh!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|The app works great on my Galaxy Tab.  However it causs my Epic 4G to reboot if I play more then one level.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|This story is full of everything, and it really helps shine a light on the history of a troubled  nation in revolution. A must!
B003L77FYS|1.0|The series itself is marvellous. But I sharply criticize the DVDs of the second and now also the third series, as the subtitles are only in Spanish an French. Is this a new policy to avoid orders from Europe?
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Feels like a quick port. Works great on my Droid Incredible but on my Viewsonic gTablet (where it looks awesome, btw) it crashes and force closes randomly. Come on PopCap, if your going to port at least put some effort into it...at least this isn't as bad as Chuzzle.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|works great on htc incredible. best game since angry birds in my opinion. can't stop playing it! you do need wifi to download it, so be aware!
074350061X|4.0|As Linda Howard's #1 fan Mr. Perfect sellers must know if you are a fan of Linda Howard's genre this being her first book is extremely difficult to find. If your looking for CD format the price range is incredibly over priced. However, if you purchase it on cassette the cost seems reasonable. Buyer beware the product sent to you maybe be inferior quality. Linda Howard's, Mr. Perfect audiobook is as always a not a disappointment to this fan. As she has matured in her complexity in mystery story writing over the years she is in my view the best author in this genre today. Suggest buyers google who you are purchasing from prior to purchasing.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Booted one time, but didn't get a chance to play. Now it would show an hour glass and then a partial screen of the menu. Has to press home to exit. Evo, MIUI 5.27
B0051QIGP4|5.0|The best purchase ever  :)   I listen to this album all day at work and just love it !  I find myself humming many of the songs :)
076115678X|5.0|I really liked this book. I've always had naturally curly hair but have never had any special tips on how to care for it. Curly Girl gave me those tips, from types of shampoo to use (this had made a tremendous difference!) to how to shampoo to which type of curls I have. I didn't know there was a difference until now. It does show tips on how to cut your own hair, which is a bit far-fetched for me but maybe I'll try it soon. It's almost impossible to find someone who knows how to cut curly hair. I've only had two really good haircuts in my life. I wish I had found this book many years ago.
B003CNQPNS|5.0|I originally bought this for my husband for his birthday, but my 6 year old son has fallen in love with it. We are about 1/2 way through and no problems w/the sound or DVD quality.
B004RKXN44|5.0|Loved this installment - strong characters and a stroy line which got better with every chapter. New charaters coming to light and I am anxious for future installments.
0345529057|4.0|This is a great value for the books that you get. However, my only complaint is that the books were \\"NEW\\" but did not come in a New condition. The box was slightly torn and appeared to have been used. Fast shipment and everything else though.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nicholas Sparks typically delivers an emotional turn of events rather handily. Safe Haven was darker than most of his other books but this was a pleasant surprise. The antagonist of the book was quite mentally ill and it was actually uncomfortable peering in on his thoughts. He was a compelling and dangerous character and also refreshing. I did not like him so don't get me wrong but I did like the way it was written. There was an ominous tone in the book which gave way to joy from time to time. I recommend Safe Haven and like many before me have said got the the point where I just did not want to put it down!
0307346617|5.0|I must admit, I didn't have high expectations. I was looking for a beach read but I couldn't put it down. The story reads like a documentary. While you need to accept the premise of Zombies taking over the world, the vignettes tell the individual stories of people who survived this near apocolyptic event. What I enjoyed was the author's ability to theorize possibilities and as the tale unfolds he brings in the human condition and the likely responses that we would have to any unforeseen event. This is one of the few books in recent memory that I took my time with because I didn't want it to end.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I have this for my DS and when I saw it for free in the app store I had to pick it up. It's a very fun and addictive game. The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because after I mute the sounds, the settings aren't saved the next time I open the game.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This is the best calendar app for a mobile device I've used since I owned a Palm Vx many years ago.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|got the on day1 for free. would have paid full price no problem no questions asked awesome awesome game. highly recommended.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|I'm very impressed with all the composition of the masterpiece!  Amazing how this animation and CGs were made.  I enjoyed again with the making of feature. Always amazing!    The only thing i noticed is the japanese box is even better with the incredible Black Box attached to the orange box - with the movie pellicule.  But it's a worth buy!  Now I'll just wait (2012) for the Evangelio 3.33, the Quickening (Q) and penultimate movie of the series.    I hope they release before the end of the days, when world will collapse in 2012 HAHAHAHAHA
1416550550|3.0|It took me a while to get through this book - it was not a page-turner for me.  I COULD put it down and almost had to force myself to stay with it.  I kept thinking that after all, here were all the elements of a promising read:  a gothic setting, complete with a cottage by the sea; a couple of convincing villains; even a secret garden.    But the structure of the novel (jumping among three plotlines, with three timeframes and a host of unexciting minor characters to keep track of) became so confusing that it slowed the momentum of the plot.  I've seen this approach work in the past but here it just did not.    Had the writing and editing been more skillfully handled, this novel could have been a top best-seller.  It could (and should) have been tight and compelling.    It is an ambitious novel.  The premise is wonderful, and there are some well-written passages.  But I dislike the author's annoying habit of tossing in sentence fragments:  \\"She stared out of the window towards the cove.  The line of trees, the sea beyond.  Stretching forever and forever and forever.\\"   Reading that kind of staccato prose is like having to brake suddenly for a stopsign over and over again.    I know many of you disagree with me, but I feel this type of story has been written before, much more successfully.  If you like this, then  you would love Daphne du Maurier, the absolute master of this genre.  Give her novels a try, and you'll fall under the spell of a truly great writer.
1400044162|4.0|I enjoyed this book for many of the reasons that other people have listed. It is well written, well researched and the characters were intriguing! However, I was surprised to see that no one noticed the apparent contempt for Americans and Christians. I was hesitant to write this and I know I am running the risk of seeming like an overly sensitive American Catholic, but I find it hard to believe that this wasn't noticed by other people. The contempt felt by Africans about Europeans and Americans is understandable, but I sensed a contempt by the writer herself which may be a result of her young age. I am a person who sees the worth and dignity in all people so it was disappointing to see all Anglo characters (except MAYBE at times, Richard) in this book characterized as phony and/or clueless. I normally don't review books that I read especially when other people have pointed out my observations which is why I was compelled to point out this flaw.
0142000671|5.0|Published in 1937, Of Mice and Men tells the tragic story of George Milton and Lennie Small, two displaced migrant ranch workers during the Great Depression in California.  George and Lennie have an unusual bond and travel together, George taking care of Lennie who is mentally disabled.  George's life would be much simpler without Lennie, and yet he sticks with him, even fleeing with him from the last ranch after Lennie was accused of rape.  George knows Lennie didn't mean any harm; he only likes to touch soft things like mice, rabbits and puppies (and in this case, a girl's dress).  Unfortunately his feeble mind and brute strength are often a deadly combination for many of these creatures he loves.  The girl was unharmed, but frightened and cried rape.  The two men escaped and moved on to another ranch where they found work and dreamed of buying their own farm someday where they could \\"live off the fat of the land.\\"<br /><br />\\"The best laid schemes o' mice an' men / Gang aft agley.\\" (The best laid schemes of mice and men / Go oft awry.) - a line in a poem by Robert Burns which inspired the title.<br /><br />Steinbeck's writing is simple and descriptive.  The characters draw you in to the story.  Towards the end I found myself reacting out loud to what was happening and found myself nearly in tears.  The ending is incredibly sad and yet the only way it could have ended.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B002ZG976U|4.0|I loved this film.  The music and dancing were AWESOME and I was completely thrilled that it wasn't \\"showgirls\\".
B004KSQN7C|3.0|I didn't get the delux CD just the regular one, and the only problem is , well the album is good but when it comes to a song about a crush, so rapper is in the song and it's someone pretending to be Nicki Minaj, and the whole part messes up the song totaly. I mean who ever wrote this song could have done a better job. MC Lite would have been better, with a beter rap.
B003SOMYNQ|5.0|I recntly relooked at the classic movie, Gregory Peck et al, and thought it would be interesting to read the book.   I found it to be a gripping good story, that holds up well with a message that still speaks to us with strength and meaning even in these 21st century days.  A worthwhile read.  Also, the (used) book came quickly after my purchase, and was in much b etter shape than I expected. All in all, a very positive experience.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Like others have said, the game feels like a lazy port. I have the iPhone version of the game as well, no lo-res graphics there. The majority of the game looks slightly blurry due to the low resolution graphics. It really slows down when the seed packet is collected at the end of the level, I can't wait to see how the game performs in later levels with more zombies. With a large file size like that, you'd expect more. There are tons of other games out there that have just as many levels and better graphics with less than half the file size of this. I'm glad I got this app for free, please hire someone who knows the Android OS better. HTC EVO 4G
B0042816YK|5.0|This movie incorporated all the goodness, peace, and longing for a happy life that we all seek. It was nothing like the movies of today that are filled with sex, violence, and horror. It is an exceptional movie!!!
B004V6MWFU|5.0|It's short and sweet: 35 minutes of a man and his uke. It's not a stripped down version of something else; instead it's just a voice you love singing from the heart.
0316098329|5.0|When I started this book I did not know what it was about.  It took me a little while to get into it, but somewhere in the middle of the second chapter I was ridiculously hooked - so much so that I could not put the book down until I finished the entire thing!  It was a weeknight, had work in the morning, stayed up until 4 AM.  Amazing read!  Have not been this excited about a book for a long while.
B0009VRHLK|1.0|This is about the most misleading and deceptive title one can imagine.    You won't believe this but somebody I know actually bought this movie sight unseen thinking it was actually about a brown bunny!  He thought it was a kids movie.  He didn't watch more than 10 minutes, saw it wasn't what he thought, and tossed it aside.  It was with several DVDs that he said he was through with.    I watched it.  It was, as many people say, a lousy movie.  No heroes or heroines, lots of pain and despair, ugly degrading sexual assault of a drugged woman, wasted time and a boring pointless storyline.  I would imagine that some of the guys who bought the movie copied the 5 minute oral sex scene toward the end to a hard drive and threw the DVD away.    A few small positives:  I kind of like road movies, i.e., movies about trips, and there were 5 or 10 minutes of road scenes that were interesting. Also, an underlying theme is the bad things that can happen to a woman who gets hooked on drugs.  People need to be warned about this but there are far better vehicles to do it.  Finally, Gallo plays a psychopath who uses other people, women in this case, entirely to satisfy his whims.  A good example of who not to be like.    Overall, a waste of plastic.
0061726826|4.0|Welcome to Lena Halloway's world.  Lena lives in a society that is carefully managed and monitored by the government.  Long ago this society came up with a cure for deliria (love) and feels that their world is better for it.  After all deliria (love) is nothing but a discussing disease that affects the brain.... it causes you to be unable to sleep, have anxiety, irrational thoughts, and do things you would normally never consider doing if not for the deliria.<br /><br />And when you put it that way, Lena has to agree who would want to go through that?  The society \\"cures\\" you when you turn 18 by running an operation that leaves you no longer desiring love.  After the procedure is complete the government will line you up with someone who they feel will be a good match for you and you will be married and live happily ever after with your X number of children, all without the annoyance of deep emotion.  Why would the government steer you wrong?<br /><br />Lena has 95 days before her cure and she ready to move into her future and counting down the days to her procedure.  After all everything she needs to know is in the book of Shhhhh, and all the warnings she needs is in the banned book called Romeo and Juliet which is not a love story at all but an example and a warning as to what happens when you are infected with deliria.<br /><br />Then one day everything changes when Lena meets a boy named Alex.  Alex is mysterious and self confident and when Lena is around him she feels her heart race and her and her skin turn hot.... surely this is the start of the fever that infects a person with deliria!  As Lena spends more time with Alex, carefully dodging the ever watchful eye of her aunt and the others who have been \\"cured\\", she starts to wonder what really is true, and what will be the ultimate cost of freedom in a society that does not believe in choices.<br /><br />Laurel Oliver has done it again.  Delirium is a story that I was not sure about picking up (much like her first novel Before I Fall).  I didn't know if I would like the subject matter and when i first heard about this book I felt it had a techy feel to it that I was not sure was for me.  Yet I had to admit that it took me a while to pick up Before I Fall as well, and I came out of that read gushing about the inner story line and deeper meaning of the book.<br /><br />While Before I Fall and Delirium are too very different novels, I felt the same about them.  Yes they are YA and I can see how they would really appeal to the YA 's out there and that can be enough - but in each book I ended up finding something deeper within the story.

Yet I had to admit that it took me a while to pick up Before I Fall as well, and I came out of that read gushing about the inner story line and deeper meaning of the book.     While Before I Fall and Delirium are too very different novels, I felt the same about them.  Yes they are YA and I can see how they would really appeal to the YA 's out there and that can be enough - but in each book I ended up finding something deeper within the story.  In Delirium I am thrust into the knowledge that some day society may try to control that in which we now count as rights and freedom.     I enjoyed Lena for her strong will and her \\"succeed or die trying\\" attitude.  Even when Lena is trying hard not to love (oh by the way - that word is a banned word!) it still shows through in her friendships and of course, eventually with Alex.

B004H4XI5O|5.0|Not just a how-to on memory, but an overall users guide to the brain. Facinating read and I think differently after reading it.
B004K4AUZW|2.0|This chick has no talent whatsoever. Her music sounds electronic rather than having actual instruments going with it. It's all just computerized and boo-boo gaga! Every song has her screaming... do you think people want that? Uh... no! We actually desire nice music having some pop, soft jazz, or even a little twang. But n-no... Lady BooBoo-Gaga wants to be all creative and artsy which made her really look bad. That one video, \\"Judas\\" made no sense at all and I had to figure it all out too long. \\"Born This Way\\" makes Lady Gaga dishonest because she wasn't born with clothes on, just a birthday suit. Also, Lady Gaga could lose her voice so technically she was only born with a heart, brain, and bones. Should we follow Ms. Gaga on Twitter and be her friend or should we start disliking her 'way-too-creative-side' for once? For me, the radio isn't streaming good music anymore which disappoints me deeply. All I hear is \\"We wanna make the world dance, forget about the price tag!\\"... who cares, our economy is showing that already dumb-dumbs?

Jackson created music only because He wanted to, now people are to sell his property. If you agree, please respond!
0316056863|5.0|I just loved this book and am so bummed it's over. Just like her mother, I was crying with laughter over anecdote in the last chapter, but will not spoil it here!  Among the reasons I could not put this book down:  1) I went to UVA too and had similar experiences w/ disappointments in love, but she makes the unrequited crushes so poignant, humorous and perplexing and brought so many memories of guys behaving like guys (loved the anecdote of pride coming before a fall on humpback mountain :) ... 2) Like most of us, she had a weird, depressing entry level job ... I love her descriptions and esp. how her improv classes made life bearable, even joyous while her day job sucked. (Thanks for sharing advice on improv as a life lesson on why we should all be agreeable) 3) yes,  it's a career management advice book too (&#34;... there is not one management course in the world where they recommend Self-Righteousness as a tool.&#34; and her descriptions of how M. Lorne liked to promote from within, get the best work from the writers/cast, etc) 4) loved characters & descriptions & all she learned at high school drama camp...stories about improv as it applies to life have changed my way of thinking and problem solving 5) thank you for the stories about the honeymoon they made me so happy that i've never been on a cruise ship vacation before and now never want to! 6) loved the inside scoop on how she learned how to do her Sarah Palin impression....and her love letters/describing what it's like (love) to work w/ her best bud Amy (et al) from SNL.  SUCH a fun read. Thank you Tina,  love you and your stories! And the leaps/connections you made in telling them to us and sharing of your true love of motherhood too (the crazy week of Oprah/SarahPalin SNL return/daughter's birthday w/ Peter Pan theme was such a great glimpse into just another day at the office of working mom trying to have it all and managing it for at least one glorious weekend... we even got a graphic/cartoon to keep it all in perspective of your long, insane hours at your dream job.  .... Keep the stories, performances and perspectives coming... please! Wish I had a sequel to read!

B00117W1KS|3.0|The original song that is played when the reaper goes after the female runner in the woods is \\"Don't fear the reaper\\" by Blue Oyster Cult.  I can't find the song they feature on this version and it's driving me crazy. Otherwise good episode and decent quality.
B00004YA0T|3.0|These were the first (other than the 4th and 7th symphonies) Bruckner recordings I listened to, and on first acquaintance I was favorably impressed. Since then I've heard a host of other recordings, and frankly find most  of them superior to these. The abrupt shifts in dynamics and tempo create a \\"start-stop\\" effect which can almost make one seasick. I've now heard most of the complete sets of Bruckner symphonies, and while none are ideal, the Karajan (sound quality varies) is probably the closest. Barenboim's Berlin series sounds terrific and has several high points, and Maazel's recent Bavarian Radio Symphony performances feature excellent sound and playing albiet with some slower tempos which I could do without.  Jochum and Gunter Wand, another supposed Bruckner specialist don't have any individual performances which stand out IMHO.

B000XCZGV8|4.0|I love David Fincher. To me, there is nothing better, more exciting, visually interesting than a David Fincher film. He is a stylistically distinct and consistently innovative storyteller and filmmaker. Zodiac is David Fincher's sixth film and is the story of a cartoonist, a journalist, and a cop. It is not necessarily the story of the pursuit of a serial killer. It is more the story of the lives, careers, and marriages destroy by those obsessed by the pursuit of a serial killer. This is a serial killer movie devoid of chase scenes, shootouts, cliched confrontations and confessions. Jake Gyllenhal plays Robert Graysmith, a geeky guy who finds himself obsessed by the cryptic letters the Zodiac sends to the San Francisco Chronicle. The letters also intrigue rarely sober veteran crime reporter Paul Avery, played by Robert Downey Jr. Over the next several years, the two newspapermen and a San Francisco cop Nick Toschi, played by Mark Ruffalo, find their lives consumed by their efforts to determine the identity of the Zodiac. Zodiac isn't a typical serial killer movie in which the focus is on the blood and carnage. The focus here is on the lives of the people who are inadvertently touched by the killer. Fincher again proves himself a masterful filmmaker who has delivered a classic crime drama that unfolds slowly over the course of nearly three hours and refuses to pander to a bloodthirsty, attention-deficient audience.

B002BU0DPE|5.0|I have gone through 6 different headsets in my time as a gamer, and this has been the best one by far.  The sound is excellent the mic is very clear and you can adjust almost every bit of audio you hear just from the headset.  Although it is great there are a few small thing i would like to point out.  At the point where the speaker attaches to the headset there is a weak point, be VERY careful about that. Also, the wires could be a bit longer, i find myself a little close to the screen at times.  Overall amazing item, go ahead and buy it now.

0792839730|3.0|\\"A Bridge Too Far,\\" the hugely budgeted 1977 war epic, is such a jumble of larger-than-life talents it's a fascinating curiosity. A film that could not possibly be made today, and frankly was difficult to make in the 1970s, it details one of the largest military offensives of World War II. Dubbed Operation Market Garden and the brainchild of Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery, 40,000 British and American soldiers were parachuted behind Netherland enemy lines to capture bridges Germany was using for escape. For multiple reasons, the maneuver was a disaster. Based on Cornelius Ryan's 1974 bestseller [[ASIN:0684803305 A Bridge Too Far: The Classic History of the Greatest Battle of World War II]] (with a screenplay by William Goldman), the film is obviously a project of love for producer Joseph E. Levine ([[ASIN:0960128018 A bridge too far: Notes from a film maker]]).    There's no doubt great heroism was displayed during the epic struggle, and one must applaud Levine's attempt at detailing what was a colossal military failure. The many talents mentioned, including a distractingly breath-taking cast of James Caan, Gene Hackman, Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Anthony Hopkins, Robert Redford, Laurence Olivier, Ryan O'Neal, Elliot Gould, Dirk Bogarde, Edward Fox, Liv Ullmann, Hardy Kruger and Maximilian Schell, keeps things interesting throughout the long three-hour running time. But it's a furiously uneven journey, with each A-list actor wasted in roles amounting to little more than cameos. \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" would have been better served to focus on one (or two) specific characters and show this elaborate battle from their viewpoint.     I first saw this as a child and left the theater scratching my head. [[ASIN:B000EHSVS2 Patton (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]] or [[ASIN:0792838408 The Great Escape]] it was not. I have watched it since and appreciate director Richard Attenborough's ([[ASIN:B000KX0IOA Gandhi (Widescreen Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:0783230532 CryFreedom]] and [[ASIN:0783113315 Shadowlands]]) attempts at detailing the confusion of war leading to the sacrifice of thousands of lives. This is a well-made film, with brilliant cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth, but it's still extraordinarily difficult to follow. Vignettes come and go and just when you are interested in a specific character, they disappear as we jump to yet another locale. Generals plan, staring at obligatory maps. Lieutenant-Colonels are stranded by traffic jams. Polish generals are trapped by poor weather. Portable radios refuse to work. German resistance is surprisingly strong. Pockets of soldiers are isolated. Some bridges are destroyed, others guarded and one is even rebuilt. \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" is, if anything, a great cure for insomnia.    Now for the good. The airborne drop of thousands of soldiers must rank as one of the most extraordinary scenes ever filmed in an era before CGI. Multiple towns are reduced to rubble in amazing sequences so authentic it feels as if you're watching a documentary. Despite the screenplay's determined disarray, a few actors bring the chaos to life. Hopkins is brilliant as British Lieutenant-Colonel John Dutton Frost, a loyal and subtle leader who holds a bridge before being surrounded. Caan makes an appearance in the film's best scene as a dogged soldier who forces a doctor (an uncredited Arthur Hill) by gunpoint to save his captain. Surprisingly, Redford's appearance practically saves the film. He skillfully plays Major Julian Cook, a U.S. grunt forced on a suicide mission to cross the Waal River by daylight in leaky row boats. He succeeds heroically, though loses half his men in the messy process.    Otherwise, actors as accomplished as Hackman and Olivier barely have a single scene. Connery spends much of the film trapped in a civilian attic. While I have no doubt these incidents are historically accurate, and an unusually large amount of survivors served as technical advisers, this is ultimately a film only the most rabid military enthusiast could love. I'm the first to admit when reading about historical battles, I often fantasize about great actors portraying the generals and how the story would play as a film. Levine, when reading Ryan's book, did just that - a Bostonian daydreamer with a vision rivaling an obsessive Cecil B. DeMille ([[ASIN:0743289552 Empire of Dreams: The Epic Life of Cecil B. DeMille]]). Sometimes less is more. You'll get none of that in \\"A Bridge Too Far,\\" of interest for that reason alone.

B001PB3RU8|5.0|You can put albums and artists into one of two categories- 1) radio hit + cranked out quick tracks album fillers that suck or 2)Tireless radio tune with depth + whole album of tracks with similar quality.  This album falls into the second, my new favorite artist Florence is tirelessly creative in her music, conveying beautiful emotion, poetry, and meaning in her unique way. A rare raw talent. The way she scales her voice reminds me of Joni Mitchell, one of my favorite artists:)   This album suits every mood from rebellious with \\"Kiss with a Fist\\" to endearing with \\"You got the Love\\" to energetic with \\"Dog Days are Over\\". The whole album has another worldly but somehow familiar sound and is truly original art. In my opinion every track can stand on its own and the whole album is a home run. Also check out some of her music videos to see more of her creative style.
0061726826|5.0|Delirium is a powerful story set in a dystopian society where love, or amor delirium nervosa, is a disease. And at the age of 18 one is cured of this illness and is matched with a spouse. The story follows Lena, whose past causes her to fear love in a way that is indescribable, that is until she does the unthinkable, she falls in love. To me this book slightly resembles The Giver, which I read in middle school and loved.   Lauren Olivers writing is so descriptive that it makes me feel as if I am right beside Lena following her throughout her journey. I felt myself trying to push Lena. I finished the book in only two days (would've finished faster if I didn't have to work). I am extremely excited about the next to books that will complete this trilogy, even though I believe that the book could have stood on it's own. I was enthralled by it's captivating language. I will find it hard to await Lauren Olivers next book.

B004QSQML8|4.0|By this point in time, most of you probably already know whether you are fans of Legend or not, so I won't spend much time detailing the various pros and cons of the film. Suffice it to say, in my humble opinion, the film is a beautifully rendered unapologetic classical fantasy, and for that, I think it succeeds admirably. While it certainly isn't one of Ridley Scott's best films, it is undoubtedly one of his most beautiful. The world he creates is stunning to behold - full of ravishing color, sumptuous detail, and an overall sense of storybook wonder that has rarely been matched.     It is because of the film's visual splendor that I have eagerly awaited its release on Blu-ray. Even when I happily purchased the Ultimate Edition DVD a few years back, I remember thinking that it felt like there was simply too much detail for the standard definition frame to handle. The DVD certainly gave a wonderful impression of the film's beauty, but many of the details seemed to get lost in the mix. As such, it was with a sense of great anticipation that I finally procured a copy of Legend on Blu-ray.    The first thing you'll find when playing either version of the film is a written introduction from Ridley Scott about the source elements used in the transfer process. In short, the Theatrical Cut is transferred from a 2006 HD master, and the Director's Cut is newly transferred in HD from the only remaining \\"answer print\\" of the film. Scott discusses the limitations of answer prints, and he seems to feel that the Theatrical Cut has the overall better transfer due to the sources used. Having read this, I prepared myself accordingly and proceeded to do some back-and-forth comparisons of the two versions.    Interestingly enough, I disagree with Scott's sentiments on the two transfers. The Director's Cut is my preferred version of the film, so I decided to sample it first. The opening scenes in the forest provided exactly the type of presentation I was hoping for: richly detailed, awash in vibrant colors, and organically film-like. A big smile swam across my face as I watched, for I felt like I was finally seeing Legend in all of its detailed glory. To be sure, the presentation isn't perfect, and there are times when the print shows its age and limitations: certain shots appear softer than others, and there's the occasional shot that looks downright murky, but on the whole, the film looks just as good as I'd hoped it would. Having given the Director's Cut a decent sampling, I then decided to check out the Theatrical Cut for comparison. If the Director's Cut looked this good, I couldn't imagine how great the Theatrical Cut would look.    To my surprise, despite the supposedly higher quality elements, I found the Theatrical Cut transfer to be less desirable than the Director's Cut, and I can point to one primary reason why: edge enhancement. Depending on the individual viewer and one's sensitivity to edge enhancement, the severity of this issue could vary quite a bit. As for me, I'm pretty sensitive to it, so I immediately noticed it when comparing the opening forest scenes to those found in the Director's Cut. The various leaves and blades of grass all have artificial sharpening halos that make the image appear less three-dimensional and film-like. It's certainly not the most egregious use of edge-enhancement out there, but it's definitely noticeable. To be fair, the image still looks miles better than its standard-definition counterpart, and there are certain shots in the film that look better than they do in the Director's Cut, but in my opinion, the Theatrical Cut just doesn't look as organic as the Director's Cut does. My guess is that this disparity in quality between the two transfers has mostly to do with their relative age - the Theatrical Cut transfer being a few years old and the Director's Cut transfer being brand new.    The other notable difference between the two transfers is the color timing. On the whole, the Theatrical Cut appears a bit more saturated than the Director's Cut. The greens tend to pop a little more (partially aided by the aforementioned edge-enhancement, no doubt), and Darkness' red complexion feels a bit more prominent. Don't get me wrong, the Director's Cut is still full of color and vibrancy too, but it appears to be a shade more muted than the Theatrical Cut. To be honest, I think the quality of the color will mostly boil down to personal preference; they both look good, they're just a little different.    As far as the audio is concerned, I have to once again give the edge to the Director's Cut. The overall audio clarity is more pronounced in the Director's Cut, whereas the Theatrical Cut mix tends to sound a bit murkier. Furthermore, Jerry Goldsmith's orchestral score sounds full and rich, whereas Tangerine Dream's score sounds a bit flat by comparison. This is not to say that the Theatrical Cut sounds bad, rather it simply doesn't have the same richness as the Director's Cut. Admittedly, I'm not nearly as attuned to audio transfers as I am video transfers, so I apologize for any lack of detail in this regard.     Aside from that, we're treated to the same extras as were found on the Ultimate Edition DVD, so you won't be getting anything new in the supplemental department. I know the reason most people will be interested in picking up the Blu-ray is for the high definition transfer, so I hope that my thoughts on the matter have been helpful in some way. To summarize: in my opinion, the Theatrical Cut looks good (despite a dated transfer with some notable edge-enhancement), and the Director's Cut looks great (despite the supposedly lesser source material). However, depending on one's preferred version of the film, as well as what one looks for in an HD transfer, the pros and cons of this Blu-ray may vary from viewer to viewer.
0670021652|1.0|I found this book so confusing and self indulgent that it was one of the most boring books I have ever tried to read. Perhaps I expected too much from the author who wrote Eat, Pray. Love but wow what a load of gibberish and drivel. I felt no romantic connection between Felipe and Liz. It was two different people who were mechanical robots and self centered. I would not recommend to anyone even on a rainy day! Boring with a capital B! Don't waste your time or money.
B00005K9LN|4.0|The first time i heard this album i didn't like it, simply because i was expecting something different. I expected something different from them. Especially since everyone kept telling how good they were and how they influenced all the bands i love now. I heard it didn't care for it then I heard Painkiller then i fell in love with judas priest! went back to this one to give it one more shot and fell in love with it!!! took me a while but won't make that mistake again.    Love every song on here except \\"United\\". i just don't like this Stadium type of songs!     Stand outs would have to be \\"Rapid fire\\" \\"The rage\\" \\"Steeler\\". Absolutely love this songs!!
0061544493|5.0|I really like this book and keep referring back to it for the helpful information.  It is written very fun and with humor.  Lots and lots of helpful and \\"I didnt know this\\" information on putting outfits together and where to buy the clothes.   Awesome!   Every woman can learn and thing or two out of this fashion fun book.
0545123267|5.0|Also reviewed on my blog, the Vintage Bookworm. [...]<br /><br />This is my second time reading Shiver. My first time reading it was in early 2010, I fell in love with it then and I think I possibly love it just a little bit more reading it the second time. This book is just....beautiful. The writing flows together almost lyrically and add in Sam's bit of poetry it fits together so well. The whole novel is told in alternating perspectives, between Grace and Sam. Sometimes I hate when books have that, but not with Grace and Sam.<br /><br />I love seeing how everything unfolds in the eyes of both Grace and Sam, their different points of view on everything and how they both feel about each other.<br /><br />This isn't just about werewolves, it's about doing absolutely everything to stay with the person you love. Even giving up your wolf side to become fully human. The love they have for each other, way before they truly ever met each other as human to human is just completely magical and beautiful.<br /><br />The emotions in this book are so strong that you just have to feel them all too. I cried so much in this book that its ridiculous. Even this second time around. All of it just completely makes me utterly speechless.<br /><br />Not only do I love Sam and Grace, but I love all the supporting characters too. Isabel, Rachel, Olivia. Especially Isabel. She has the perfect attitude of sarcasm and angst.<br /><br />If you haven't picked up this series yet, do it now. You won't be sorry! If you're in love with love, and werewolves, you'll be in love with this book.<br /><br />Cover: The cover is gorgeous. Simple, and gorgeous.<br /><br />Also, as a side note, if you haven't noticed Shiver's font is in blue, and not the normal black. And the second book, Linger, is in green ink. Which I think is absolutely cool!

0312430000|5.0|I am a process guy. I spend my life working with others to optimize their business operations (mostly Information Technology operations), so disciplined execution is a religion to me. Gawande's Checklist Manifesto was recommended to me by some colleagues and I'm thrilled that it was. I bought my copy and read it right through in two sittings! I loved it!<br /><br />The best solutions are often the simple ones. The checklist is such an example. Who'd think such a silly little concept could make such a huge difference? Well, I, for one, have seen it work. I've used and recommended checklists and similar methods for years. Especially in the world of IT, a culture of \\"high priests\\" not unlike Gawande's medical world, the thought of \\"dumbing down\\" such complex work to a menial checklist is viewed as absurd and insulting to the Techno-Illuminati. We always seem to OVER-complicate things.<br /><br />I love how Gawande digs into the topic of complexity and how it's destroying our ability to execute effectively and accurately. In Gawande's world, complexity kills - literally. In my world, complexity kills too, but financially. We need to bring some order to the chaos and stop the \\"killing.\\" The Checklist Manifesto is a beautifully lucid and easy-to-read guide to simplifying a complex world.<br /><br />Congrats to Atul Gawande on a magnificent piece of work!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|By far one of the best mobile games to date. tons of unlockables means hours of play to be found in this game. However, it's not wihout its quirks. The game appears to be a resource hog, causing all background apps to shut down, thus, locking up the phone on occasion. Also, the devs didn't implement a screen timout disable, meaning your phone will go to sleep if you don't touch the screen for a moment, requiring a reload of the game. Graphics could be WAY better. This game is well worth your time, as long as the developers support and update their product.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|first off the resolution is terrible. second i cant even see all of the game when i open it and lastly it doesnt play. the only thing i can do is open it, load it and quit from the game and even quit the game takes forever. hopefully there is an upadate to fix this issue soon since i paid for it
1439102724|4.0|\\"Sing You Home\\" will not disappoint if you enjoy Jodi Picoult's books. This one, about a woman who discovers that she is a lesbian, and a fight over frozen embryos with her ex-husband is thoughtfully and tastefully done. While the \\"happily ever after\\" ending is a cliche (and you'll be able to guess what happens as the end nears), the book itself is a good read. You won't be disappointed!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|this is as fun as I remember the PC version being. However, I don't understand why it doesn't remember my volume levels, I always have to lower it.
B003ZYU3T6|5.0|This is in regard to the Criterion Collection Blu-Ray edition of [[ASIN:B003ZYU3T6 Modern Times: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray]]].  The transfer is indeed unbelievably beautiful.  Audio is great, too.  Only quibble I have is that Criterion used Chaplin's 1954 cut, in which he edited the Tramp's song.  The complete song footage is included as a supplement, but it would have been good to have seen the movie without the edit, which today seems illogical. Chaplin was a fantastic actor, comedian, composer, writer, and sometimes director, but I question some of his choices as film editor.  I hope subsequent Chaplin releases by Criterion will give us the option of watching the complete original theatrical cuts.  Owners of the older David Shepard-produced Chaplin releases on Image DVD will want to hang onto them.  Owners of the Chaplin films on Warner DVD will be ready to ditch them.
0670022411|2.0|Please don't read this book, it was sooo long & boring! It started out great, grabbed my attention right away. Then about 100 pages in the vampire is literally wining & dining the witch~vampires drinking wine & eating food???? Ugh,I don't think so.  If you want to read some great witch books, read the Mayfair witch series by Anne Rice. Now that's some good stuff!  Read the one star review by Jana L Browning, it sums the book up perfectly.
0452285186|5.0|This is a clever, funny book. To those who gripe about it being too short, maybe they thought it was Tolstoy and not a book of comic illustrations. Yes, it's shortish. But is that how you buy books... length-based purchases? I base my purchases on content, and this book is spot-on (as is the other bunny book). So give me quality over quantity... and this is original, disturbingly funny quality.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I was excited to see this game, and it's fun enough but very rough around the edges. I'm on an Evo and there is some laughable lag in parts, maybe down to 1fps! I think they just did a mediocre port and launched it prematurely.
0525951652|1.0|I am really conflicted about the issue of paying more for an ebook that a paper copy or hard cover, since I view this practice as obscene. I almost didn't buy this book until I read the reviewer comments and saw that most of the poor reviews were related to the price, not the book itself.     I absolutely refuse to pay more for an ebook than a hardcover or paperback edition. The publishers' reasoning that customers buy ebooks only because they are cheaper is not valid. I buy ebooks because I travel and don't want to be weighed down with 1-2 lb books and to save paper. I don't like to read paper books any more--they can be heavy and cumbersome, or, in an increasing number of cases, have print so small I have to use a magnifying glass!     Amazon's observation that sales are down for ebooks when the publisher sets the price makes sense to me. If I must have a title for one or another reason (e.g., book club), I try to use the library, and, if I cant, I buy the hard- or paperback because at least it has costs for the publisher. Do authors make higher a percentage of royalties on ebooks? If not, I can see no excuse for price gouging and hope other readers who feel as I do join me in a boycott of ebooks priced higher than the hard copy. If publishers are motivated only by the marketplace, maybe this will help motivate them to price ebooks fairly.
B00005QEO1|5.0|Permanant vacation\\" was a blast of a cd and this one it's followup was a monster hit with several gigantic hit singles on it. At this point the band live was better by far even than their drugged out era.  The songs on here were very strong and even better than the fun Pv cd. This high streak continued with 'get a grip' too but that's another story. This one was  one of 1989's biggest cds worldwide by any standards. And that should tell you how good it is in a hard rockin way.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|i love this game..works really well on droid x responsive touch controls among some of the best i have used
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Once you start playing this game you won't be able to put it down!   Even better than the PC version-love the touch controls!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|One of my regular searches on the stores was for this game. Beat it on pc... Now I have plants in my pockets. Works great on my droid X.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Very addictive. Runs without trouble on my droid x. I was wary at first because the title did not catch my interest. But this game has tremendous replay value. Highly recommended.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I got this game for free and it works great on my EVO 4G. It plays just like the PC version. Get it now!
B004SBQAN8|3.0|Part Teenage Soap Opera, part Sci-Fi actioner, I Am Number Four has trouble deciding what it wants to be - until the very end.     The Teen angst riddled main character is an alien hiding out on Earth. He has special powers but very little common sense. He meets a girl, falls for her, then has to contend with her Ex; moaning and complaining along the way. At one point I was rooting for the bad aliens to get him. *Yawn*..    But then things got interesting at the end, TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE...  *ZAP* *BANG* *SLASH* *MONSTER ATTACK* *GUNPLAY* = It was good enough to wake me up, since I fell asleep watching the lame first hour.    A decent rental - Just do yourself a favor, FF to the end.
B004DL5K2K|5.0|The music on \\"Blizzard of Oz\\" speaks for itself--some of the best music Ozzy EVER recorded, Sabbath or no--so I'll focus on sound quality. Basically, these 2011 remasters, done by the esteemed George Marino at Sterling Sound, are now THE definitive versions of this all-time classic album. The 1995 remaster was pretty good, but this is less compressed and more detailed. You can really crank it up until your speaker cones are at the opposite end of the room--which is nice in this age of heavy compression. The music also flows more liquidly than the 1995s. I generally don't like the sound of analog, but this new remaster does remind me of a VERY well done LP.    So, if you're at all interested in sound quality, this newest 2011 remaster of \\"Blizzard\\" (and \\"Diary\\" for that matter) gets two thumbs up. This is how remasters SHOULD be done!
B004EPYZOO|4.0|This is one wild movie. It has everything: Sex, violence, car crashes, and demons!  If you liked \\"Crank\\", then you will love this movie.  Nicolas Cage stars as man out to rescue his grand-daughter from a group of Devil-worshiping, gun toting crazy people. Hot on his trail is a demon eager to drag him back to Hell.    Add generous portions of T&A and you have one memorable movie.   Hilarious!    Buy it.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|was really excited to see this game available for the android. but once I got it installed it showed the hour glass and then the screen just stayed black. guess I'll just stick to playing it on my xbox 360.
B003616M3O|2.0|Manu Katch&eacute; surrounds himself with a great group of musicians for his recording \\"Third Round,\\" and because I've been on a bit of an ECM binge lately, I bought a copy without listening to any preview. Big mistake.<br /><br />Perhaps an analogy will speed matters along. Suppose you spend a week on your favorite beach, and each day is pretty much the same, great weather, balmy days, breezy evenings, each day blurring into the next as nothing exciting or different happens. You may have had a good time, but the trip itself will not be memorable.<br /><br />See, I've listened to \\"Third Round\\" a couple of times, and each time, I grow frustrated at the sameness, the smoothness, the consistency. Many ECM recordings I have heard are minimalistic, but even the ones I dislike were challenging at some point. This one simply fails to engage my interest as a listener.<br /><br />I'm sure many will label this music as soulful and shimmering, but it feels tired and pale to me, much like many of the offerings from the \\"triple Z jazzz lite\\" genre instead of the real deal.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Downloads this on my phone. Runs very fast. Solved the adventure mode in only one day, and open up the quick play. Installed on captivate. It runs well. Lags on my htc aria. It is very similar to the iphone version.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|love this game, seems exactly the same as on my ipod touch.  never force closed even 1 time on my driod 2
B000FC1MCS|5.0|I'm a picky reader and must say I was enraptured by this story. More of a character study than a complicated yarn, this book takes you inside the thoughts and feelings of a boy with Asperger's syndrome to the extent that you might see the world differently after a while reading. While the book isn't perfect, I gave it 5 stars due to the amount that I enjoyed it and felt satisfied after finishing it. Mr. Haddon did a great job.
0545123275|3.0|At first glance, Shiver entranced me. The word choice is beautiful, the characters aren't your typical YA. Unfortunately, things rapidly decrease from there. Main character Grace is captivated by the wolves in her backyard. This is basically the whole story. There is no clear explanation of WHY. From what I understand, she falls in love with 'her wolf' because of eye color and 'he's cute'. Right from the start, Grace and Sam are intensely in love, simply because they've been stalking each other for 6 years. Now, I don't know about you, but I don't picture the foundation of a world-shattering love as staring at each other. Besides Grace and Sam,the characters are completely vague, thin tendrils of personality. Shiver contains almost no plot/suspense besides 'oh no, you're gonna be a wolf! just spending time together waiting for the inevitable'. Besides the crystal clear scenes and beautiful word choice, this isn't much of a story. In fact, towards the end of the book, the author basically says 'yeah, that character everyone worried about died fifteen minutes later' then continues the next chapter like effect nothing happened.The ending skipped key scenes, basically going 'and this happened, then this happened, then THIS-' you get the idea. The original spin on werewolves is genuine, but do we really need another romance?
B001EN71CW|5.0|I'm starting to like this, but as I'm only on episode 2 and I don't want to spoil the show, I'll confine the comments to general. Lovely clear blu-ray with cinema quality sound and the bit with the Captain and the Hood 'I will hunt you down' is pure classic. It's looking good :-)
B004NSULHM|1.0|I tried...and tried...and tried.  I finally had to give up and admit that it's garbage.  Maybe I'm missing something.  Perhaps Radiohead is trying to push the artistic envelope by being as grating to the ears as possible. If so, they succeeded. It doesn't impress me, though.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Awesome app.  I have been looking forward to this arriving on android and I wasn't disappointed. Well done! I have already wasted a chunk of time on this one.
1435122968|4.0|Pros:  Beautiful cover, great and fairly thorough collection of Lovecraft's writings. Very pretty and well made book.    Cons:  The name of the series \\"leatherbound classics\\" is misleading, as this is not leatherbound.  I have the Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy from the series which actually is leatherbound, with padding inside.  I really liked it, and wanted another.  This book is merely a hardcover, though the hardcover is very pretty.  A better description/picture may have prevented this.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|THE PURCHASE GOES THROUGH BUT THE APP WILL NOT DOWNLOAD.   BEWARE! THERE IS NO WAY TO REFUND!  THIS IS RIDICULOUS
B004P8ITGU|5.0|Theodore Boone, like all Grisham's heroes, is passionate about the law and justice. Unlike the rest of Grisham's protagonists, Theo is a boy of 13 who is not cast in the Doogie Houser MD mould--he's not a boy genius. So he has a regular school life, where he tries to help his friends with the legal problems they or their families might face, using the resources at his command. So what happens when an immigrant schoolmate of his tells Theo that his cousin might be a witness to the biggest murder trial to hit Strattenburg? Grisham manages to work things out in such a manner that the climax, when it comes, is believeable, though not as spectacular as those in his adult books. He uses Theodore Boone to depict life in a small town from the perspective of a teenager, who is aware of how issues such as divorce and immigration affect his peers.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|There is a bit of \\"street philosophy\\" between the two main characters, Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx, that I found actually quite important to me and have thought about as reference points repeatedly since seeing this movie... Judge for yourself on that count, but it does at least hint at possible reasons for a kind of callous disregard for life that Tom's \\"Silver Fox\\" character, as Tom describes his character, shows us; and in contrast you have Jamie Foxx who, in the movie, is perplexed, surprised and bewildered at Tom's hardness as a hit man. Yet watch as this observation by Jamie molds his own behavior and character. Another stand out specific was a scene where Jamie Fox, the taxi cab driver, is stuck in a very vulnerable spot with skinhead hardcore street punks, ...and then what happens next has a kind of sudden impact, as Tom Cruise, hit man extraordinaire, arrives and \\"rights\\" things. Usually it's a visually striking image that grabs the eye into entertainment enlightenment, but this scene has both visual and audio impact. So I watched this full scale assault of a scene again and again because it was so well done. There is another shocker of a scene (a hit) that is so up close, intimately personal, and it incorporates a violent change of mood, emotion and human connection that adds a kind of heart felt pathos that may only be matched again by the end of the movie on the rail car. Watch how a strange and dynamic relationship develops between Foxx and Cruise, one mixed with revulsion, respect and even a kind of teacher relationship with Cruise as the teacher, not to mention his last line of the movie which is really a key commentary of our collective cold culture of which Cruise mastered to full effect and profit for as long as his ride took him.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great game! Super fun and addictive! I was so excited to see it for android.  Runs great on the sprint evo 4g.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|I read this when I was about 19 and could hardly keep myself from hitting the road after reading this book.  True freedom of adventure is so hard to come by, but this book will take you there.
0783225857|5.0|Great Movie. Just a word of caution during purchase though.  I selected this movie thinking I was also getting a free movie rental. Somehow I ended up on one of Amazon's other seller's and didn't get the free rental. Both pages looked nearly identical.  Normally I wouldn't care, but I had plans for using this additional viewing which unfortunately now is not an option. I take the blame for my stupidity. I didn't see the switch take place so I'm just cautioning those that follow in my footsteps: the offer is only extended to purchases from Amazon. If you want the free rental, make sure you don't accidentally get switched to \\"sold and shipped by\\" someone else.  Just saying....
