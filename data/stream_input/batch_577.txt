B0000012Y1|5.0|This is the Lohengrin of all time. After having listened to this performance for many years on LP, I am thrilled to have it on CD as well. James King has a voice of bronze and Janowitz is an angel as Elsa. The supporting cast is wonderful as is the orchestral playing.
B00000APLB|3.0|...it is a good Stones live record,worth the price. But I still prefer Ya-Ya's,Flashpoint and Stripped (haven't heard Live Licks yet).But if you are a true fan,get it!It is double!
B000BNX3B4|3.0|Most people I've talked to really liked this movie, so I feel in the minority with my rating.  I liked the concept of the movie and really wanted to love it.  I waited for it to come out on DVD and rented it right away.  But, when I started watching it I just couldn't grab on to the role of John Cusack as the romantic leading man.  He doesn't fit that part for me, at least in this movie he didn't.  It's too bad that Dermot Mulroney had to be the bad guy in the movie.  He would have fit the romantic lead role a lot better for me.<br /><br />Just my opinion, but the casting didn't work for me in this flick.
B000089RV6|5.0|this is a great, if not the greatest piece of hard rock record.Every song is on hi-voltage.No surprise they haven't a greatest hits album - for this band this have no sense at all.
0140120416|5.0|I bought a much more expensive textbook for my Russian I course in college. The New Penguin Russian Course cost a fraction of what I paid for my textbook and it was a lot better. There is a lot of vocabulary and pronounciation help. There could be more exercises, but considering the compact package the book is in, I think that it's way above average. I'm really happy with my purchase.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|The Christmas season wouldn't be complete without seeing The Christmas Carol, but in our family's option, there is only one perfect \\"Family\\" remake of this Christmas classic. That is The Muppet's Christmas Carol.  With Michael Caine as an excellent Scrooge, the screenplay is superbly written. The musical score is wonderful (worth buying the soundtrack CD)! True to Muppet form, the characters are entertaining for the children, but the humor and countless puns are great for the adults, making this the perfect FAMILY movie.  You'll have to watch it several times to appreciate the antics going on in the background. Watching this movie has become a Christmas tradition for our family.
B000002C1V|1.0|I'm an avid fan of all of Pink Floyd's albums - but I can honestly say that I cannot stand this one. <br /> <br />Yes the music is nice - it is a nice piece of work, and I certinaly can't deny that Roger was a fantastic songwriter and musician - but it is, quite literally, a solo piece of work by Roger, with the rest of the members from Pink Floyd being backing instruments mainly, and I think that is an insult to the Pink Floyd name. <br /> <br />Pink Floyd are a BAND. They are suppoed to write together (or as much together as they can stand of each other), play together, sing together and whatnot. If Roger Waters wanted to produce a solo piece of music on his own, then that would have been fine, but to do it under the Pink Floyd name... I do believe it is an insult. If the whole of Pink Floyd were more engaged in the album (and the four members had been in the band) then it wouldn't be half as bad. <br /> <br />This album was also certinaly different from the others, with the opening lines being, \\"Jesus Jesus what's it all about...\\" It's just not Pink Floyd at all. And a whole album based on the War? <br /> <br />Classic examples of Pink Floyd's Greatest Songs would be \\"Animals\\" and \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\" - I wouldn't recommend this one to a new, curious Pink Floydian.
B0009I7NNA|3.0|like many out there who got this album, its because of bat country, quite possibly one of the greatest metal songs out there these days. after hearing that song i thought, if they can do more stuff like that, this could be a really great cd. the only problem? they couldnt do more like it. bat country is the only song with really catchy lines or riffs, not to say every song sucks, (BC, trashed and scattered, beast and the harlot being some highlights.) but as you get down to around track 5, you think to yourself, hey havent i heard this already? the songs start sounding all the same, filling solos really start getting annoying. a solo is just that. you play 2,3 and in some really special songs, more, you dont play them all the time. now a ton of solos from a modern metal band should be a good thing, and usually is, but they really over-did it here, and this is coming from a huge metal solo fan.  <br /> <br />the next thing is the vocals. we all know the story by now, shadows has throat surgery and loses the ability to scream. completely clean vocals should be an extremly good thing coming from a modern metal band, and again, it usually is. but something is different here. not to say shadows cant sing, but with how many lyrics there are in each song, a scream or growl would really add a lot to keep them from sounding too much the same. his voice is good, but it gets annoying quick, and they use the studio effect where it sounds like 2 people are singing at the same time WAY too much. also, in one song, shadows tries to scream, hes got a really good scream as heard on waking the fallen, but here it made me sad.  <br /> <br />the riffs in general really arent metal riffs. some are, the main verse riff in beast and the harlot, most riffs in bat country, the opening riff in sidewinder, but other than those and a few others, its mostly just punky, rock riffs. <br /> <br />the lyrics arent bad, probly the only thing i dont have much to say about for this album. so overall,as a huge 80's metal fan, hearing about this album, hearing bat country, i thought this would be great and in a few places it really is, compared to some stuff out there. but when people start thinking this is true thrash metal, or true metal in general, it makes me mad. theres a hundred bands from the 80's and even 90's, who do it much better and even a few modern ones who do it better. i think avenged sevenfold was shooting for the \\"return to the 80's metal\\" sound, but kind of missed the mark. in my opinion, compared to their previous albums, avenged sevenfold has truly \\"sold out.\\" even if the same album was made, with shadow's voice like it once was, id say the same thing. to many punky, poppy riffs. i really do appreciate that someone is at least trying to bring that sound back but its just not here. <br /> <br />P.S. the drummer is the best part of this whole cd, hands down.
B00007KGCQ|4.0|A surprisingly good film considering it is a sequel, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, provides us with another adventure involving the dynamic trio.   <br />Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore, Demi Moore, Matt Le Blanc (!), and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well, allowing for a highly entertaining movie.  Be sure to keep your eyes open for short, but sweet guest appearances by celebrities. <br />On the negative side, Justin Theroux as the Irish (???) villain and Crispin Glover as \\"Thin Man\\" (???) are ridiculous to say the least, and take away from the overall enjoyment of the movie!  <br />In short, the plot is average, while the setting, the special effects, and the music are EXCELLENT!   <br />Overall, though not a masterpiece, it is definitely a movie worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment! <br />
B0000B1OFL|4.0|With the thought that most remakes are terrible peices of trash that shouldn't of been made in the first place.  I was pleasantly surprised with this remake of \\"The Italian Job\\".  You get time to know a little about the character but doesn't hesitate to give the action and comedy quickly.  Good acting all around.  This movie is a good rental for the occasional watching.
B00004RF98|5.0|If you love the GE commercial of the Elephant dancing in the jungle, you will see the original in this movie.  I think it is Gene Kelly at his best and he was a pioneer (if that is an appropriate word for a dancer)in the casual dance.  Fred Astaire had always done \\"formal\\" dancing--tails and all, and Gene Kelly danced in sweaters and penny loafers. Enjoy this movie for the story as well as the music.
B000E97X66|5.0|The Born to Run tour were Bruce Springsteen last shaky steps to the performer he would become. Three years down the road his shows would be a well oiled machine. Exciting as those future shows would be, they would never have the urgency of this perticular tour. Spingsteen was going for broke with his Born to Run album. He seemed very much aware that his reputation needed more than just that album. He needed to solidify his status as rock's most exalting performer.    Born to Run was a new concept for Spingsteen. The stripped down writing and music of the album were a long ways from his dense debut and sophomore outing. And with the drummer and keyboard player replaced, a guitarist added, the band was still feeling each other out. On top of that he appeared to fall victim to his own hype. Being billed as the savior of Rock and Roll pulled up the stakes.    Born to Run took Springsteen to Europe for the first time. He was to play two shows in England, both in the Hammersmith Odeon. The first Hammersmith show presented on this disc. became a mixed blessing. The band played a little over two hours. Short for an E-Street show. Springsteen seemed like he didn't want to outstay his welcome. On the other hand he did want to show what the band was capable of. Wich wass complicated by the hype that preceded this show. The expectations were high. Springsteen's nerves are very tangible on this disc and throughout the night. Probably why the show got mixed reviews of the English press.    Hearing it 30 years later these reviews are a mystery. No band today delivers what Springsteen did back then. No artist shows the balls Springsteen did. Even though he was still forming his live act he felt confident enough to play with the material on stage. Note the different versions of Thunder Road, She's the One and For You. The latter a pure magical performance. Even though the band had been touring for just a few months they sound as a tight unit. Most notably on Lost in the Flood and the show stopper Quarter to Three.      The E-Street band has often been referred to as the best barroom band in the history of Rock and Roll. This record proofs that they deserve a little more credit than that.
B0006GAI6O|4.0|Okay, let me start by saying that I do like the Japanese version of this story better.  But the American version isn't the dog poo others are trying to lead you to believe either.  John Clark (Gere) is staring at middle age and is search for something different.  Problem is that he doesn't know what he wants and ends up finding it in weird round about way: he wants to dance.  The main mistep is the fact that we're lead to believe that Clark believes that an affair is what he wants.  It is why he goes to the dance hall in the first place.  The reason he goes night after night.  He wants to get close to Paulina (Lopez).  It isn't until Paulina tells him no way is that ever going to happen (of course, you're thinking she's out of her mind.  But hey, it's J.LO) does Clark have to do some serious soul searching on whether he wants to continue the classes.  Stanley Tucci was halarious as the wannabe giggilo Link.  But yes, there is plenty that doesn't translate well in the American West.  There is a serious problem in a marriage when a husband creates another branch of his life-friends and what have you and doesn't tell or feels like he has to hide it from his wife.  And given what was presented, Clark had no reason to do this.  I'm not saying that the man couldn't do these things, but he most certainly should tell her.  But no.  Clark wants to talk in the dead of night when his wife is asleep and then act like he's not being listened to.  C'mon buddy-wait to the woman is conscious.  The side story with the detective was just filler and felt like filler.  But it is still a delightful film and Gere is absolutely dashing in a black and white tux and holding a single red rose.  That alone was worth the ticket price.
B00062PN6I|3.0|It takes about 2 weeks to ship since it's from an outside vendor. The headphone is a bit tight on both ears & it completely covers them, making your ears sweaty after a while. <br />The sound's ok but I couldn't hear a big difference between those & my Sony's. The biggest drawback is that they come w/ a 1/4\\" stereo plug. That plug doesn't fit on your pc or ipod. You'll need to buy an adapter that converts it to 1/8\\" stereo mini jack if you want to use it for that purpose. I found one at RadioShack for $3.

This is a well executed game of cat and mouse and one will be surprised of the one who ends up with milk spilled down their fur.  There is nothing more dangerous than a well executed plan in this two hundred year old story.  The main concern of this story is the power struggle between the devious but intelligent protagonist, the Marchioness de Merteuil and the Viscount de Valmont.  They have been formerly lovers and are now engaged in a relentless battle of mutual domination.<br /><br />The twist and turns will have you shaking your head, but you won't be able to turn away.

B000BISBDY|3.0|I own some of Johnny Cash's older albums as well as the spectacular 2-CD The Essential Johnny Cash.  But since I didn't have any of his American recordings he did with Rick Rubin, I got The Legend of Johnny Cash for the six songs representing those albums.  It's rather obvious that this collection was aimed at young people who have heard and liked Cash's music but wouldn't otherwise be caught dead in the record store's country music section (and who am I kidding; that includes me).<br /><br />In that sense, it's a good CD.  It includes the biggest of Cash's big hits: \\"Cry, Cry, Cry,\\" \\"I Walk the Line,\\" \\"Ring of Fire,\\" \\"Hurt,\\" etc.  But as a definitive greatest-hits collection, The Legend of Johnny Cash falls well short.  \\"I Still Miss Someone,\\" \\"The Ballad of Ira Hayes,\\" \\"The Rebel- Johnny Yuma,\\" \\"The One on the Right is on the Left,\\" and (probably most bafflingly) \\"Daddy Sang Bass\\" are all absent from here.  What's more, \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\" is the *studio* version- anyone at all can tell you that the definitive version is the live version recorded at Folsom Prison itself.  This CD is only an hour long- that leaves plenty of time for more deserving cuts.  The six American Recordings songs collected here are all great, and I think I'm going to spring for the albums themselves.  \\"The Wanderer,\\" featuring U2, also made it on here; I think that's one of Cash's best ever.<br /><br />If you want a single-disc Johnny Cash collection, you could do worse.  But I still think that The Essential Johnny Cash is a better bet.  Even though there's no American Recordings material on there, it still includes every other song this collection does, plus many, many more great songs.
B00005JMXX|3.0|There was nothing new in the doomsday epic \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\". Be sure, the cinema photography and the special effects were good, and the story line was decent, but the movie lacked in several respects.  Mostly from the director, who could not have possibly watched the final cut. If he did, he was full of himself and missed out on what he actually created. <br /> <br />The acting in the movie was mediocre at best, not that the actors themselves were bad, but again this falls on the director. I can imagine my mother, cousins, aunts and uncles... all those ladies that watch soap operas, real people and how they would react in these situations... it just didn't fit. <br /> <br />You may want to add this to your collection, it is far from a A movie, but a step above the B movies of the 1970's, If you need to, rent it, watch it explore it love it for what it is. Doomsday movie collectors, this really is a must for you. For the rest of us we hope for something better.
0783219695|4.0|The movie is fine but the box is slightly scratched. Hope better precaution will be taken during next packaging.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is a tour de force - a film about fated love thwarted by human repression. Ang Lee calmly unfolds the canvas on which he has captured the heart and spirit of Annie Poulx's raw and honest short story. The spectacular Western landscapes represent the spirit of purity and endurance, and Brokeback Mountain is that special place where love can be freely expressed. Jack and Ennis are only visitors to this paradise, but while there, they discover a love that will endure through the rest of their lives. But back in the harsh mundane world, Ennis' internal struggle to deal with this love is the heart of the movie. Tied down by his fears, Ennis refuses over and over to build on their relationship despite Jack's many entreaties. So they struggle to recapture paradise in occasional rendez-vous over the years until tragedy strikes and Ennis must endure with only memories of their paradise lost.
B0000UJL96|4.0|\\"Star Trek VI\\" is the film that redeemed the disappointing reactions that the fifth movie drew out of loyal fans.  I for one, enjoyed that movie, even though it's my least favorite...but that's another debate for another review. <br /> <br />After the Klingon moon Praxis explodes and permanently damages the atmosphere of the Kronos, the Klingon home planet, peace talks begin between the Federation and their longtime-nemeses.  The bitter and deeply-resentful Captain Kirk (William Shatner) is chosen to lead the soon-to-be-retired Enterprise crew for one last mission, that is to escort Klingon Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner in a wonderful brief role) to Earth.  After an embarrasing dinner-in-space between the two races concludes, and many of the crew members are more-than-buzzed, the Klingon vessel is attacked.  Since the Enterprise was the only within range of the Klingon vessel, Kirk and Dr. McCoy (the late DeForest Kelley) agree to surrender themselves and suffer the consequences, in hopes of saving the peace talks.  There's just one catch: Who indeed attacked the Klingon vessel? <br /> <br />What unfolds is a mystery sci-fi adventure, where multiple tales intertwine.  There's the tension on Earth between interplantery diplomats, Kirk and McCoy's struggle to survive their prison sentence, Captain Sulu's (George Takei as a former Enterprise crew member) dilemma between following orders or assisting his former starship-captain, Captain Spock's (Leonard Nimoy) sponsorship and mentoring of another promising Vulcan (Kim Cattrall in a very good performance), and finally the Enterprise's investigation of the conspiracy.  This is an unusually complex story for \\"Star Trek\\" movies, which typically focus on two threads at most.  Nicholas Meyer was brought back to helm this movie; a wise choice considering he directed what is widely-considered the best of all \\"Trek\\" films - \\"Star Trek II\\" (I agree with that praise). <br /> <br />I love these movies, and have revisited all of the movies' Two-Disc DVDs from \\"The Motion Picture\\" to \\"Nemesis\\".  In \\"The Undiscovered Country\\", I've come to admire the colorful characters, fantastic visual and sound effects, and a metaphoric tale that addresses the dangers of prejudice and racism...out of ten films, \\"Star Trek VI\\" is one of the boldest. <br /> <br />I've also noticed a few shortcomings in each movie.  In this film, one of them is a DVD-exclusive edit, where a brief flashback technique is used as the names of the conspirators are revealed.  I won't reveal which scene that is, but those who've viewed the film know which one I'm talking about.  It's not a huge deal, but it's distracting and doesn't fit the visual style of the rest of the movie.  Another criticism applies to the entire movie - It's too rushed!  For example, the trials of Kirk and McCoy have no sense of time.  Did it all occur within a day?  Did it span across a few days?  It was a \\"show trial\\", but either a lot of ground was covered and not given enough screentime, or General Chang (Christopher Plummer as a Gorkon's chief-of-staff) was an overly-gifted prosecutor and Colonel Worf (Michael Dorn in an underused role) was the most useless defense attorney in the galaxy.  I'm leaning towards the 'lack-of-screentime' theory.  Another case is the time spent on Rhua Penthe, the prison planet that Kirk and McCoy are sentenced to.  They spend very little time there before they figure out some key puzzles of the conspiracy, get into a few scuffles, and escape their doomed future.  The screenplay, which even creator Gene Roddenberry had objections to, had a labyrinth of ideas and character studies that could've been expanded.  Yet, the ideas come off as preachy, and the mystery is a little too easy to figure out.  I know Roddenberry wanted \\"Star Trek\\" and his vision of the future to be accessible to all viewers; I agree with that, but cinema is the medium to expand visual art into another realm, not simply to make simple art look prettier. <br/> <br />Nevertheless, this is a very good film, in spite of all of its flaws.  The idea of prejudice and acceptance is one of the bravest \\"Star Trek\\" has tackled; this sixth entry portrays that concept with an adventuruous mystery with some Shakespearen flavor, outstanding special effects, breath-taking suspense, and a heart-warming farewell from the original Enterprise crew. <br /> <br />This \\"Trek\\" movie is definitely worth checking out, thanks to this spectacular DVD treatment.  The Extras are all worth watching, and the commentaries (both the Text trivia track and Audio track) are insightful and the best of the \\"Star Trek\\" DVDs. <br /> <br />All-in-all, I would like the film to be more than it is.  But I enjoy it a lot, and the Extras are some of the best in the \\"Star Trek\\" Collection.  Science fiction fans and Trekkers will love this one.

047119350X|4.0|Voet and Voet is an excellent introductory biochemistry textbook.  The focus leans more towards the chemical aspects as opposed to the biological, which allows it to fill an important gap among undergraduate texts.  The scope is broad and comprehensive, with clear writing and informative illustrations.  While the book is a valuable resource, the price is truly outrageous.  For those adopting textbooks for classes, I recommend assessing whether the added chemical rigor is worth the added price for students.  Serious and motivated students of biochemistry will likely appreciate and benefit most from this book.  Check out the contents (e.g. at a library or college bookstore), and make sure they meet your needs, before taking the considerable financial plunge in buying this book though.
B000002H2H|5.0|Ride the Lightning was Metallica's first real step towards greatness. This cd starts off with Fight Fire With Fire, a song with a mellow intro that explodes into a menacing riff. Following that is the partially Mustaine written title track. For Whom the Bell Tolls is next. This song has the best bass on the cd. All of the other songs on this cd are very good, especially Creeping Death, which I feel is the only song on here that could be held at the Puppets level. We can't forget at the end of the cd Cliff Burton's Call of the Ktulu, the greatest of the Metallica instrumentals. This is a very solid album, all the songs are at least 3.5/5 stars. My least favorite is Escape, but it is still a very solid track. The difference between this Metallica album and the next one is that this one (other than the first 2 tracks) lacks the sheer knockdown power of Puppets. I don't mean this one won't make you want to go on a headbanging rampage, I just mean it doesn't have enough effect to be labeled a classic like Puppets, or Megadeth's Rust In Peace. Overall, very solid album, a must have for any metalhead.

B000001E8P|5.0|In 1995 Pulp managed to do three great things. First off, they gave a fantastic performance at Glastonbury that put the other acts to shame. Secondly, they released Different Class and thirdly, Jarvis Cocker invaded a Michael Jackson performance at the Brits. Well, ok, maybe two great things.    In the mid-nineties the media, and thousands of 'sheep' trying to be cool by following everyone else, were hyping the battle for best album between Blur and Oasis. Unfortunately, both bands failed to deliver anything thought provoking or different. What's The Story (Morning Glory) was a good album, filled with anthems for a generation, but lacked any real depth to it and was weaker than Oasis' debut effort.  The Great Escape by Blur again was weaker than its predecessor Of course, those thousands rushed out and bought them and raved about them in all the `cool' music magazines.    However, 1995 produced at least two better albums. One was Stanley Road by Paul Weller and this one.    The first thing that makes this album stand out is the lyrics. Cocker is a master of writing witty lyrics that make you laugh and smile and are also a brilliant observation on everyday life. He writes about anxiety, struggles, frustrations, excitement, love and bewilderment and his singing pushes this to an extra level where you can feel all of this emotion in his performance. A clear contrast to when he is talking in a near-monotone voice. The songs and Cocker's singing contain so much energy where needed and the quality of the vocals can be surprising sometimes.    All the songs are truly fantastic, over ten years on and they still sound just as good. It was a breath of fresh air when it was released and maybe it is because it doesn't sound like the rest of the `Brit-pop' that it doesn't sound dated.  Pulp go to show that it is ok to look nerdy and to be different than what is considered cool. Cocker is a vast contrast to Liam Gallagher and yet he displays a presence whilst performing on stagethat Liam could never achieve, with a voice that can portray more emotion than most of the `cool' bands around at that time. Different Class? Yes. Better Class? Definitely.    Track listing:    1. Mis-Shapes: A catchy anthem for people who look `different' saying how it's ok to look geeky and not as cool as the rest of the crowd, and how these people are going to take over someday.    2. Pencil Skirt:  A pleasant little tune about Jarvis, a girl and the problems of young love.    3. Common People:  This tune was the anthem in Britain during the summer of 1995. Common People quickly became the `anthem' of the year, and rightly so. It was more infectious than anything Blur or Oasis had to offer that year. Awesome lyrics, fantastic vocals and brilliant melodies.  Even the amount of times this was over played on the radio couldn't kill its effectiveness and brilliance.    4. I Spy:  More great lyrics, haunting undertones and another excellent example of Cocker's vocal prowess, his low tones give this song its edge.    5. Disco 2000:  Very catchy disco tune that you can't get out of your head, more great humorous lyrics.    6. Live Bed Show: A song that grows on you, tells an interesting story.    7. Something Changed:  A run of the mill love song that sounds a bit out of place but still a nice little tune.    8. Sorted For E's & Whizz:  A song about going to raves and the morning after, lovely tune and interesting images left in the mind.    9. F.E.E.L.I.N.G.C.A.L.L.E.D.L.O.V.E:  An odd song that isn't without its good points, takes a while to get going though.    10. Underwear:  The angst of teenage love is expressed in this great song.  Great lyrics and stunning vocals.    11. Monday Morning: Catchy upbeat tune, lyrics are top notch.    12. Bar Italia:  This one really grew on me, a nice end to a fantastic album.

B000EGDC14|3.0|I originally purchased this album when it was released in the U.K. back in August of 2005.  The U.K. edition contains only eleven songs and no bonus disc, and when I first listened to it I didn't really like it.  I felt that the album was too short, Alison Goldfrapp's vocals were pretty but not stunning, and the lyrics lacked that unique, slightly twisted quality that was so much a part of Black Cherry and Felt Mountain.  To me, Supernature is much less challenging and much more conventional than I had expected it would be, and while it is still not my favorite Goldfrapp album, I don't despise it quite as much as I used to.  I don't think that Alison and Will intended Supernature to be the intellectual effort that was Felt Mountain or the sexual affair that was Black Cherry.  It is an album that was inspired by glam rock and disco, and thus it is more playful and fun and doesn't take itself too seriously.  Basically I was expecting substance and I got glamor instead, but the album has grown on me since then and it's not all bad.  The inclusion of the bonus track \\"Beautiful\\" on the U.S. deluxe edition is a major improvement over the original release.  The original release was too short and ended with \\"Number 1,\\" one of the weaker tracks on the album in my opinion (why it was released as a single I'll never know).  \\"Beautiful\\" closes the album with the bang that the U.K. edition was missing.  The material on the DVD is all very good excluding the animated feature \\"Jaako and the Poet in Frappworld,\\" which looks like it was created for and by a five-year-old.  I do not think that Supernature is Goldfrapp's best work, however, it is glitzy, fun, danceable, and will undoubtedly initiate legions of new fans.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|In \\"Sky Captain\\", Joe (Jude Law\\" fights to save the world from a mysterious onslaught of hulking, flying and blasting machines bent on...some diabolical mission.  Along with a nosy newspaper reporter (Paltrow) and with some help from the one-eyed commander of a brigade of British fliers, Joe tracks the machines across the world.  Joe's weapon of choice: a P-40 Hawk tricked out with all sorts of James Bond type gearJoe links the machines with a mysterious scientist named Tottenkopf, and a mysterious plan called \\"The World of Tomorrow\\".  Can Joe solve the mystery before...well before it's too late? <br /> <br />This was an immensely disappointing movie.  Virtually everything in \\"Sky Captain\\" is borrowed from somewhere else - from the \\"Indiana Jones\\" movies to the Fleischer \\"Superman\\" animated shorts of the 1930s; from \\"Flash Gordon\\" to \\"Jurassic Park\\", from \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" to \\"Far Horizons\\" - so that you spend less time enjoying the movie, and more time combating a stiff case of deja-vu.  When it isn't regaling you with its grasp of other films, TV shows or comic books, \\"Sky Captain\\" tosses you generic CGI combat scenes - like those between Joe and a squadron of flying robots through midtown Manhattan, or Angelina Jolie and her squadron up against the robots below the waves of the Pacific.  Rather than transitioning from one scene to the next, \\"Sky Captain\\" just jumps into different famous movies - even the identity of the mysterious Tottenkpf is a form of homage.  The special effects aren't all that special - though the CGI seamlessly blends live-action with computer animation, the overall effect breathes less life into the animated parts than simply turn it all into a big cartoon.
B000E8NRR6|5.0|Production-wise, it's flawless.  It's only natural to assume that Donald Fagen would be one of the pioneers of the digital age of music reproduction.  His output has always been superior in a sonic sense.  Whether listening to Steely Dan albums from the 70's, or the new releases from the last 5 or 6 years, or his solo work, he and the hard working engineers (Roger Nichols, Eliot Schiener) behind the boards always make the music feel as if it's being performed fresh, right on your dash, or in your living room.  Morph the Cat is no exception, in fact it snaps and pops better than any of the aforementioned.  The sound quality in headphones or on a decent 5.1 setup is unparalleled.  I don't even have to turn my volume knob past the halfway mark to get that good feeling with this one.  The title track sets the tone right off the bat, bassline driven smooth melodic funk.  \\"H-Gang\\" is the natural hit.  \\"What I Do\\" is my favorite right now.  The people who have complained on amazon about \\"underproduced sound or no video\\" obviously have a ways to go as far as grasping the concept of dvd-a sound. Yeah, I'm caught up in release day emotion, but I swear, this one will stay in heavy rotation for years to come, just like the rest of Fagen and Becker's stuff.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|I have had the extreme pleasure to have seen Michael Buble in concert recently and I can tell you for sure that if you are a fan, you have to have this DVD/CD set.  Michael Buble is a born performer and he loves his fans.  Everything you see on this DVD is true.  He interacts with the fans and jokes around a lot.  I appreciate that he does not detach himself from the audience while performing.  He is also very generous with his praise of his top notch band....and yes girls he actually does run through the audience during the middle of a show.  I have been to a number of concerts from every genre there is in music and I can honestly say his show is one of the best I have ever seen.  From the opening number, \\"Feeling Good\\" to the final number, \\"Song For You\\", there is not a bad song in the bunch.  If you are not fortunate enough to see him live, then this set is definitely the next best thing.
0440219078|5.0|This book shows you just what life is. No other book has showed me this like this has. The giver is not light, three day then quit reading. Most people will read it to the end on sihgt, like I did. <br /> <br />To avoid giveing away the valuable plot, I will say that the world of civilization is a disturbingly organized, planed, emotionless land. People lack anything \\"Bad,\\" but also lack anything good. The great thing is, this will challenge your definition of good for the rest of your life. You will never look at war and hate the same way again. Hell really is repitition. <br /> <br />~Lowelife
B000060OFT|5.0|A fresh spin on Shakespeare's classic, 'Romeo and Juliet,' this film brought to life what was merely words on a page during high school literature class.  <br /> <br />Garnished with colorful, neon settings and fairytale-like costumes, this film did a wonderful job of respecting Shakespeare's original dialogue. Backed up by a modern-day soundtrack, I highly recommend this film as an aid for teaching classic literature to today's youth. <br /> <br />The chemistry between Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Juliet (Claire Danes) is the glue that holds this production together. Their playful, young love for one another is displayed perfectly throughout the film, and the colorful setting and props only add to the romance. I especially love the director's spin on the balcony scene, relocating it rather to Juliet's in-home pool.  <br /> <br />As Juliet, Danes maintains a character of innocence with intelligence, a balance I think Shakespeare originally intended for the young Capulet. As Romeo, DiCaprio displays an ever-convincing soul torn by lovesickness - every lady's dream come true. Honestly, in all of his films, I've never seen the boy act so incredibly in love as in this movie. Their chemistry, combined with that of the full cast, makes this film truly unique in itself.  <br /> <br />While some of the director's \\"tweaks\\" to the film may be too much to bear for the older generations, I think most people will find this film breathtaking, the way Shakespeare intended.
B000001FE0|1.0|I been busy and want to tell you that there is a defect in the cd   3 songs do not play how can i return for a new cd? this is the first time i ordered and will be my last. very disappointed
B0001HAISQ|5.0|Well shot & edited.  Acting is very good.  The English accent can be difficult for children.  The big problem, as with all tapes now, are the interminable commercials and advertising at the beginning.
B0000DJZAH|4.0|5 stars for Tommy redbook CD layer and 3 stars for the stereo SACD transfer. What can I say this is a classic album that I have wanted to purchase on CD for sometime. For me it is very important to have the best remastering I can find. By that I mean closest to the original vinyl, but with the benefits of digital music. Tommy is an immensely enjoyable album so I went for this Deluxe hybrid SACD release. This Tommy is probably as good as it gets on CD but the stereo SACD layer was a bit of a let down. I am a huge fan of SACD's but on Tommy I was much happier listening to the non SACD stereo layer. In standard CD playback this is a very impressive and enjoyable remastering. I have not heard the 1996 reissue that other reviewers claim will be the same as the non SACD layer of this disc but liner notes claim the stereo layer was also remastered in 2002. It would surprise me if the 1996 Tommy was this good but I can not say for sure.  The stereo SACD playback was dynamic crisp and detailed, it just did not have the flesh and life found in the standard stereo layer. This is the first SACD I have purchased that I do not playback with SACD when possible. As for the bonus tracks maybee they could have been better chosen, but they are never the less a pleasant addition. (This review makes no judgement on the 5.1 playback as it does not interest me )
1401308201|5.0|For lovers of the musical \\"Wicked\\", this book is a must-have!  The look of the book from the padded, distressed appearance of the cover, the foxing on the pages, the photos, the history of the show... it all adds up to a wonderful read and a great addition to other theatre books.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity had, at least the best writing, characters, and dialogue of any movie of 2005.  Most movies don't give you both action, drama, darkness, and humour. And with Joss Whedon's writing, you get humour when totally unexpected. He's brilliant. <br /> <br />I watched this movie with people who've never seen the series and didn't know anything about it and they loved it as well.  If anything, it leaves you wanting more so you'll want to check out the Firefly series after seeing the movie.  The series fills you in on the characters and you can't help but fall in love with them.
B000DZIGDU|1.0|Maybe this is a case of a really good book made into a bad movie...I don't know, but when all was said and done with the film, I was left sitting there wondering why on earth was this even made into a movie? It's completely BORING. Some are saying boredom IS the point of the story. Well, hell, I can sit around my house and leave my front door wide open indirectly inviting maniacs to enter my home, but if a maniac never comes, should I write a book about the experience of waiting for something to happen???? This film might appeal to some intellects and they might even see something artsy about the story, but for the average movie goer, skip it. If you're a movie maker and you have an uneventful plot, at least give some depth to your characters and some enjoyable dialogue. I've enjoyed people's private home movies with kid's birthday parties more than this. What a disappointing snooze.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|i love it <br />i love it <br />i love it <br />i love it <br /> <br />its amazing. i cant stop loving it
B000BW7QX6|5.0|Loved the original series but was blown away by the film. It expands on the un-answered question left by the untimely demise of the series. Even if you haven't seen the series the film is easy to pick up with the character dynamics, and adore the way no one is spared, which means you can't predict the end before it comes. This is one to watch over and over. Hope we can push for more films or to resurrect the TV series.
B000E1155E|5.0|A (beer) breath of fresh air! As a 20+ year vet of the music biz on both sides of the Atlantic, I have no hesitation in saying that this is the most stunning and exciting debut rock album since The Clash's '77 wake-up call, \\"The Clash\\". It makes me homesick for Sheffield...and I don't remember ever having been there.
0316776963|5.0|I have never read a book like this before in my life.  A few years ago, a friend and I spotted 'Me Talk Pretty One Day' in a local bookstore.  It looked interesting, so we both picked it up, opened it to any page, read only one paragraph.  We both hurled laughter across the entire store at the same time.  I always wondered if the entire book was that funny.  My question was answered in 2006.  I decided to use this week of Sring Break to read it and I am so glad I did.  I have never experienced a book bringing on this kind of laughter.  I would assume that I should not be reading it in public, as I've had some stares from people due to my fits of uncontrollable laughter.  But who's concerned about that?  This book is the absolute best laugh I've had in years.  Highly, highly recommended.
B0007GAERG|1.0|This is a new take on a very old, tired sound. All of her songs are starting to sound alike. I used to be a fan, but apparently she has run out of ideas. Skip this cd.
B00005JLEU|5.0|My daughter and I were at home and saw that this cartoon was going to be on cable.  I saw the ratings it was given and I was curious of a cartoon that would get such high ratings so we decided to watch it.  It was so charming, funny and whimsical that it actually affected us.  I got online the next day and ordered it.  Very sweet  and entertaining cartoon!
B000E5N62U|4.0|I have been a Steely Dan and Donald Fagan fan for more years that I care to admit here.   I purchased this CD yesterday and listened to it on the way to work today.  From the first bass lines and the sound of the keyboards to the slap of the snare, I settled in for a comfortable ride. <br /> <br />Although there is nothing really new here on this CD (music wise), we are introduced to some new characters and new stories which are always a pleasure to receive from Donald Fagan. <br /> <br />This is jazz for people who don't buy jazz CDs but too interesting to be just background music... but I doubt you'll be humming any of the tunes after the first few listens. <br /> <br />I reccomend this CD to fans of both Steely Dan and Donalds solo work, but I'm afraid those who are not yet fans will not be converted on the basis of this single CD.... a shame really. <br /> <br />For me, I have added to my collection, I am happy with the new music, but I'll soon be revisiting some of my classic Steely Dan CDs.
B000065V1V|3.0|This album does not equal the Bowie albums from the 70s but is better than most of his 80's and 90's output. The music displays an energy and enthusiasm that has been missing for quite some time. I particularly like the 3 cover songs on the album - Cactus, I've been waiting for you, and I took a trip on the Gemini Spacecraft. The last is a cover of a song by the Legendary Stardust Cowboy. BTW the lyrics of the last cover are very similar to the Frank Sinatra song \\"I Thought About You\\". <br />The original songs on the album don't work that much for me except for \\"Slow Burn\\", \\"Sunday\\" and \\"I Would be Your Slave\\". <br />Worth it for people who are more than casual Bowie fans otherwise start with the older Bowie albums.
B000E1155E|5.0|Other than some CDs purchased to replace old LPs, this is the single best CD that I have heard and purchased in the past couple of years.  The sound is sharp, vocals are grand and the songs interesting.  My first listen was in the car on the way home from work... I honestly sat in the driveway to hear the rest of the CD before turning off the engine!   <br /> <br />These guys artfully combine new and old with some great hooks.  I've never placed a review on Amazon for a CD.... but this CD is so good, it needs to be shared with others!  A bargin price too!  I paid $9.99 at the local Newbury Comics..... compare that with the price for recent releases by David Gilmour, Donald Fagan among others....   If this is the future of the music industry, the industry is saved!!
B000AYEIZY|5.0|When this band formed in the mid-1960s, Eric Clapton envisioned Cream as a blues trio.  As history has shown, things didn't quite turn out that way.  Forty years later, Slowhand finally got his wish.  There are blues numbers here in abundance from the likes of Willie Dixon, Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, T-Bone Walker, Albert King, and Skip James.  Recorded 37 years after their final proper concert at this same venue in 1968, time may have ravaged their looks, but definitely not their playing.  As another reviewer has stated in these pages, Cream acts like a band this time around rather than as a group of egotistical soloists going for the jugular night after night as they did \\"back in the day.\\"  The jams for which Cream are renowned are kept to a tolerable length.  Most songs on this collection clock in around 5-6 minutes.  Those that do go long (Stormy Monday, Spoonful, We're Going Wrong, Sunshine, Toad) do not suffer as a result.   <br /> <br />As it was back in their heyday, each member is afforded his own showcase.  For Jack Bruce, it's \\"Rollin' And Tumblin'.\\"  On this number Jack, accompanied by his harmonica (no bass), Eric playing the slide, and Ginger Baker on the drums, stuns and amazes the crowd with an energy that belies the fact that the man nearly died in 2003.  Eric Clapton's showcase is the T-Bone Walker classic \\"Stormy Monday.\\"  This is a new song for Cream as it was never on an official Cream release until this collection came out.  Slowhand demonstrates that when he wants to, he is the master of the blues guitar.  The man was simply on fire the night they recorded this song.  Ginger Baker's showcase was, of course, the drum solo \\"Toad.\\"  By and large, drum solos are usually excuses to head to the bathroom or the concession stand.  Not so here.  \\"Toad\\" is simply compelling.  It's isn't boring - it's Ginger Baker demonstrating that yes, the drum IS a musical instrument.  By the time the solo ends you don't realize it had gone on for over seven minutes.  It's that good! <br />    <br />The big surprise of this whole collection is Ginger's song \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\" from \\"Wheels of Fire.\\"  On the DVD that visually documented this reunion, Ginger told the interviewer that he was \\"threatened with execution\\" by his family if he didn't play this song.  At a little over three minutes, this is the only hint of psychedelia that Cream shows throughout the set.  Slowhand plays it straight - not a wah-wah pedal to be heard, and frankly it isn't missed (much).  Jack Bruce is in fine voice throughout.  Of interest is the band's different take on White Room.  Instead of Jack Bruce singing the entire song as he has done since he wrote it, Jack sings the first two verses, Eric takes the refrain of those two verses, then the two swap roles for the third verse and refrain.  Eric's song \\"Badge\\" had never been played live by Cream as it was recorded at the end of their 1960s run, and here Jack Bruce proves once and for all to hear that if you took his bass lines away from the song, there would be no song. <br />    <br />There are lots of plusses on this collection.  The jamming is kept to a tolerable length, hence more songs to enjoy.  The volume is lower than in their heyday, so the musicians can hear each other, and the interplay between the musicians makes for some outstanding music.  One need look no further for proof of this than Cream's take on \\"We're Going Wrong\\".  Thirty-seven years ago this band was full volume pedal to the metal jamming.  Today this band plays like adults - it swings!  Credit that to Ginger Baker, who plays more like a jazzer these days (when he does play).  There is one minus - no \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\" (they fixed this oversight when they played MSG in October 2005).  Other than that, this collection is a worthy addition to Cream's legacy.  Buy it now!
B0008ENICU|5.0|Everyone knows who is in the cast and the plot. My review: An excellent movie!!!!
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I awaited the Nov. release of this film with impatience, after hearing about it in Bath, England last fall. I am a huge fan of Jane Austen. After viewing the film at the theatre, I was mystified - was this the same story? It seemed to venture very far from the book, which is my favorite and re-read many times. So when I saw it was coming out on DVD, I took it home and watched it again, with the same result. <br />It wasn't until I turned on the Directors comments and heard his thoughts on the film that I understood what had happened. He obviously was looking at the story from his young, male point-of-view. In his comments I saw him repeatedly misunderstand the points of the story.  <br />I think the first issue I have with the film is it's lack of elegance. I have nothing against farms, but this was an Estate with a farm in the book. It set an uncomfortable tone for the Bennetts and made them much less genteel. How could young ladies with this up-bringing even get the attention of \\"Gentlemen\\", much less marry them? (As looked at from Jane Austen's time.) <br />However, I must say that as a film without the historical context in mind, I thought the actors were very good and captured their characters superbly. The filming was excellent, with wonderful scenery and moody scenes with dark colors. And after that misty morning scene of Elizabeth and Darcy, I give kudos to the Director as well! <br />Would I recommend it? YES!
B000007MVU|5.0|This is a beautiful album that does just what it implies in the title. It takes you on a sentimental journey of beautiful music and memories of times gone by.  Ringo is a talented drummer, but I also love to listen to him sing! <br />
B000E5N62U|4.0|as i get older, i wonder what is wrong with most people. i realize that tastes vary but i have only listened to half this album so far and i am amazed at how great the arrangements are and how lush the melodies and beautiful the lyrics. just listening to an album in these terrible days of pop music where great musicians get to stretch out in solos and backed by beautiful arrangements is a rare treat. so far, i would rate this even up to the Nightfly. While one might argue that the base melodies might be better on that release, the playing here is far more sophisticated and polished. I'm sure someone is making good jazz rock somewhere but as a middle aged guy i don't know where to look so i rely on donald and walter to impress me every few years. I hope it continues for a long, long time. I happen to think that the melody on h gang and morph the cat are excellent. as for there being nothing new here, i suppose that is true but only one artist in a 1000 can be so brilliant that one album is completely of a different style than a previous one. well, i've now listened and studied the whole album and believe it's donald's best. mona is perhaps the best song on the album, just a great melody . enjoy it all.
B000BM6AVA|4.0|First off, 95% of nu-metal sucks, other than maybe soad, slipknot and flaw still hold my attention. This is an album worthy of 4 stars. Serj is a great vocalist. However, Daron YOU SUCK as a singer. I've been a fan since the \\"System of a Down\\" album. Which is classic, along with Toxicity. The lyrics have also lost alot of serious value. It is alot of goofy and corny type stuff now. Which is alright but can get obnoxious at times. Also, I am not one to act holier than thou if I have been listening to a band longer than a few others. However, it is REALLY annoying to hear people who have only heard this album talk like they know everything about SOAD. So, please stop it. Song's like Kill Rock N' Roll, Hypnotize, Tentative, U-Fig, and Soldier Side make this album really good in fact. However song's like Lonely day (What is worse, Daron's vocals or his sappy cheese filled lyrics?) just bring the album down. If you are new to soad and are impressed with this album, check out \\"System of a Down\\" and \\"Toxicity\\" to really be blown away. Also, look at the song \\"She's like Heroin\\" Serj's parts are great and make the song listenable,, then Daron's singing is just God awful. Seriously, who gave this guy a mic? I would have given this album 5 stars if Serj had done all the vocal's. I do recommend this album though, as long as you can deal with Daron's vocals. By the way i found a band thats better than system of a down go listen to a a sample at [...]
B000E8QVWY|5.0|<br />I finally got a copy of Walk the Line. It was as good as I had heard. Both Joaquin and Reese did a super job. Actually, not really being a Johnny Cash fan, I would have to say I liked Joaquin even better than the original. (Sorry Mr. Cash) <br /> <br />Reese seems to be the all American girl that is hard not to love. I'm so happy for her winning the award. She deserved it. Both leads are so talented for being able to learn the music they had to learn for their roles. Bravo!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Mesmerize may be the shortest album to come out so far this year, but it's one of the freshest, wildest rides of the upcoming summer. Clocking in at a mere 35 minutes (what?!!!) you may feel shortchanged - until you listen to it. In those 35 minutes SOAD packs in enough wallop to get your blood pumping and clear out the cobwebs from your mind - and your speakers. In addition to being (for the most part) fast and furious, the lyrics run the gamut from criticism of America's current policital regime and its destruction of our youth to a hilarious adolescent rant on penis size and all that that encumbers.  <br /> <br />As usual with this band the vocals are challenging and complicated featuring plenty of freshly weird harmonies and an almost operatic furiousness that bar-for-bar matches the hard edged, guitar driven melodies.  <br /> <br />Now if only they'd include a few more U.S. cities on this tour! Damn, this is one rockin' good disc . . . Get it . . . NOW!!!! BY the way i found a band thats better than system of a down go listen to a sample at [...]
B00000JPYQ|5.0|This CD really brought back memories! I can't believe it took me this long to reunite myself with this \\"old friend\\". If you are to own only one UFO CD this is the one to have. It starts a little slow but really gets going fast and the digitally remastered CD is a great polish to an all time great. Possibly the best live recording to come out of the 70s. Recorded at two locations while touring with Blue Oyster Cult it is indeed a CLASSIC!
B000089RVX|5.0|the first time i saw evanescence was when i was browsing through one of the many cd departments/stores in town. since i hadn't paid my cable bill in awhile, and the radio stations down here [are bad]. (the only alternative station was shut down, blleeccckkk!) i took a look at the cover, read the list of songs and generally assumed it was another female attempt at 21st century folk rock, and dismissed the album. i realized that i had made a huge mistake when i heard the song \\"bring me to life\\" while staying up late, watching mtv. i know many have said it's \\"linkin park-ish\\", but it's a new twist on the whole \\"rap rock/epic rock/dark rock\\" genre (or wherever you choose to place it), plus amy lee is an amazing singer. you hear more of a classical (as well as goth, and hard rock) influence in the songs, other than the usual rap beats, and computer blips, which i'm very sure that most of the population is sick of by now. what really saves it is the haunting true-to-life lyrics that read like a diary of a troubled soul... by the way i found a band thats better than evanescence go hear a sample at [...]
B000BTJCRM|5.0|I will keep it short, this is absolutely one of the best CD's you will ever hear. As the first song is appropriately titled Colossal, this band is about to become Colossal. So if you can, go return your Maroon 5 CD's, your Hanson CD's, and go out and get something that will blow your mind! Even though it is only available as an Import until May 1st, go out and spend the extra money; like you need food, and like you need water, trust me you will need this CD(and no I don't work for the band).
B000050HTO|1.0|I always heared about little bobby dylan this, little bobby dylan is good that, you never will or did you ever hear sutphing like little bobby dylan?  no i did not and we'll prefer to call those the good old days.  I just hope he's reading this review because i have a fresh opinion and some pretty advice for him to hear (if he can after he done listened to his own self till he's deaf of hearin):  don't say it undaneath ya breff little bobby dylan.  sing it out like a loud and proud woming that you have become or that you maybe are.

6305428042|4.0|I do love a good witchy woming.  And would you know that there are one more than two of them in this flick that makes licking a tail of a paticula rat fun..F-U-N it is to the max I say.  The problem with this kind of a sexy film is that while it is a good kind of effort, you speck me to believe it?  No, I don't believe for one diggity dang second.  Ain't no such thang as a witch or two otha witches.  But boy, if they was, I would be flyin so so very high.
B000BT97AO|5.0|Mirrormask written by Neil Gaiman benefits from the astonishing effects of the Jim Henson Company that realizes the unusual artwork of comic book industry pro Dave McKean.  The acting by the entire cast never lets you down, and the young protagonist  Stephanie Leonidas offers an exceptional performance.  In short, it's an intelligent childrens story entrancing as well for adults.  Oh, and it has one heckuva a musical score. <br />
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Great series that ended too soon.  DVDs are good, but not great. Not a whole lot of extras, but worth it if you like the series.
086140324X|4.0|Being a science fiction reading, I'm not much of a fantasy reader, but for those that read either genre, they know that there's occasionally cross-over appeal, and I'm in a country where not only are Terry Pratchett books everywhere, they have also been translated into the local language, Estonian, so I thought I'd have to read at least the start of the series.  This is a funny, tongue-in-check novel.  This is for everyone that enjoyed The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and unfortunately since Douglas Adam's books dropped in quality after Hitchhiker's, for anyone wanting to continue reading books in the same vein. <br /> <br />One can say after reading this, that the events in this novel could possible be the definite definition of why things that happen happen.  Ever have one thing after the other just go bad and then to worse, and then one day something bad doesn't happen, maybe even something sort-of good, and you stand there in astonishment.  Well the explanation could be the same as the reason as in the book, due to an going bet between Fate and Lady Luck, with occasionally the Lady winning.   <br /> <br />The most endearing character in the novel must be Twoflower's trunk, full of gold and other assorted items (with assorted meaning just about everything).  And if you don't think a writer can make a piece of luggage an expressive character, think again.  (For SF readers, the trunk may remind oneself of the briefcase in Michael Swanwick's Stations of the Tide.)  And then there's the bi-protagonist's, Rincewind's, acceptance of events cast down by fate: \\"after hurdling over the she-bear and her cubs, and the hungry pack of wolves that suddenly appeared, as I climbed the tree to get away, I took my hand back from the branch with the snake on it and wondered if it was poisonous and reproached myself; of course it'll be poisonous\\". <br /> <br />The real danger here will be the desire to continue on with the 27+ novel series.  The plus side is that it's a fast read.  Being a relatively slow reader, where reading 100 pgs in one day is a big deal, I finished this novel in a record (for me) two days.  This is a great light novel for such things as an extended airline flight and you want to arrive in a good mood.  The Colour of Magic, published 1983, 285 pages, 4 stars.
B000060K4O|5.0|Ghostbusters was a huge hit back in 1984, and the ubiquitous presence of Ray Parker, Jr.'s theme song was a seemingly nonstop presence on the radio for months and months - I'm still trying to get that silly song, which seemed awfully cool at the time, out of my head.  I was a kid when the film was released, so it's no surprise the film was funnier to me then than it is now, but Ghostbusters has actually aged fairly well.  Typified by Bill Murray's deadpan manner, the humor here is all about delivery and timing and atmosphere.  It appears as if Bill Murray is making up at least half of his lines as he goes along, which means he is in top form.  Dan Aykroyd plays second fiddle in the lineup, but Aykroyd has always played a mean second fiddle.  I wouldn't be able to identify Harold Ramis by name just by watching him perform, but he's definitely a full-fledged member of the Ghostbusters comedy tri-fecta (not to mention co-writer with Aykroyd), which actually becomes a foursome midway through the film with the addition of Ernie Hudson.  I still can't say I care for Sigourney Weaver all that much, but she certainly adds something to the film as the guys' first customer, the object of Dr. Venkman's (Murray) affections, and eventually the conduit for Zuul's incarnation into the world of man.  Supporting actors?  Ghostbusters has you covered with Annie Potts as the Ghostbusters receptionist and Rick Moranis as the rather hapless Louis Tully.  Up until his possession by a demonic dog, Moranis still seems to exude a little of his Bob McKenzie persona (although he does not imbibe copious amounts of beer or utter the word \\"hoser\\" a single time).<br /><br />As far as I know, Ghostbusters is the only film in which the Environmental Protection Agency comes very close to causing the end of the world.  Everything's going great until EPA agent Walter Peck (William Atherton) shows up at Ghostbusters HQ and accuses the guys of storing hazardous waste on the premises - which eventually results in the shutdown of the ghost storage system and, in short order, ghostly anarchy all across New York City.  Things had looked gloomy early on when Dr. Venkman (Murray), Stantz (Aykroyd), and Spengler (Ramis) lost their university positions and research grants, but three mortgages later they had landed on their feet with the formation of their unique ghostbusting business.  Sure, one could question the legality of atomic-powered backpacks and untested laser-like weapons that could theoretically give time and space the mother of all hiccoughs, but there's no question that they did get the job done.  Even if it means getting slimed by some pesky green monsters, the guys soon gain national exposure by effectively putting poltergeists and disagreeable spirits out of business.  Then the EPA comes along, releases of all the trapped troublemakers into an atmosphere already saturated with very bad vibes, and the next thing you know ancient Sumerian demons are moving into penthouse apartments and laying plans for hell on earth.<br /><br />Obviously, the entire story is played for laughs, from the silly sliming hijinx of the ghosts to Murray's indubitably subtle style of non-serious intellectualism.  You can't even take Dr. Veckman seriously as a scientist, as he's more concerned with picking up chicks than actually learning anything - until his newest love interest starts hovering four feet above her bed.  That's sort of a wake-up call.<br /><br />Admittedly, all of this craziness was funnier when I was twenty years younger than I am now, but Ghostbusters has actually aged extremely well - even in terms of the special effects.  Vintage comedy never goes out of style, and that's why most of us, for decades to come, will be incapable of thinking anything other than \\"Ghostbusters\\" whenever we hear the words \\"Who you gonna call?\\" and cannot help but laugh whenever anyone happens to utter the phrase, \\"Yes, it's true.\\"ly results in the shutdown of the ghost storage system and, in short order, ghostly anarchy all across New York City.

0670033375|5.0|While this is typcally Jared Diamond, chuck full of logic, and data to support his background, and many passages are very dry and slow reading, it is a book of profound importance.  He, more than in the Third Chimpanzee, or Guns Germs and Steel, provides a relevance to our past, present and future, that the other two could not.  Full of prophetic examples, he once again accepts valid arguments which need to be explored against his hypothesis.  Then he does so in enlightening fashion.  His factual background, examples, and logic are an extremely useful resource for anyone interested in our future.  If only interested before reading, one becomes genuinely concerned as they progress through this book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0060392584|5.0|I've been a fan of Marilyn Manson since about '95 (when I first saw \\"Sweet Dreams\\" on MTV), so when this book came out back in '98, I snatched it up immediately.  I couldn't put it down from the minute I opened it, between fighting with my then fiancee and trying to finish my Career Development Courses, it took up every other waking hour I had to spare.  This book will enthrall you and if you have a weak stomach, will sicken you, but I promise you, you won't be able to put it down.  If you were ever curious about how Manson got as depraved and unapologetic as he is, you need to read this book, it'll open your eyes!!! It takes you from his rather normal formative years to how he was six months before Mechanical Animals was released, after reading this, I admit, the whole androgynous David Bowie-esque album didn't suprise me.  Every Manson fan should own this, if you are curious, love or hate him this is a great read, if you have the money, get this now!  Trust me you will have a very hard time doing anything else but reading this book, it's like freaking crack...
0399245030|5.0|I picked up this book to help my 5yr old daughter read, and fell in love with the book. The story is so sweet. The pictures humorous and touching. It's a well crafted and lovely book. And I recommend it for any adult who loves a good short story.
0375758992|4.0|This book gives a very real idea of what life is like in southern Africa and why it steals the hearts of those who grow up there.
B00005T30L|5.0|Ghost World is that movie you watch once, impressed far beyond your expectations and hooked with its catchy laugh out loud dialogue and clever humor. If you don't buy it, you'll be renting it sporadically from then on. I never read any of the comics relating to this film and you don't have to. Enid and Rebecca are best friends and total opposites, the only thing they share is their complete apathy toward most of the people they know. Everything in their eyes is overrated and they kill time poking fun at others and humilating them for their mere pleasure and entertainment. It's cruel, yes, but it's quite funny too. Enid secretly is at a breaking point in her life, unsure of who she really is and what she wants from life, she changes hair color, hobbies and jobs as often as she changes her socks. But the real laugh is on Enid when a nasty prank on average guy Seymour, sparks a scandalous attraction and jealousy and acceptance slowly take hold of her. Though the age difference between Seymour and Enid is acknowledged, you never shake your head with disbelief. It's a journey they both need to take in their lives, however unaccepted it may be by society rules. Eventually, Enid and Rebecca grow apart and the story never disappoints in showing us the agonies of real life. This little gem belongs on your shelf of favorites if it finds a place in your heart. And while you're laughing uncontrollably, I'm sure it will.
B0002OERI0|4.0|First and foremost, stop sitting down to write a review with the mind set that you are about to tear down the \\"teeny boppers\\" who think Green Day is punk. The Sex Pistols are the most mentioned band in these reviews aside from Green Day. The Sex Pistols aren't great musicians, their music is sub-par and is only worth listening to for a history lesson in anarchist punk rock. Stop comparing modern bands to old school bands, the result is always a disappointment borne of overwhelming nostalgia. Appreciate this album for what it is. Green Day are incredible musicians, slightly overplayed but very catchy and their shows are very energetic. This is not a forum for eletists to bash the youth of today for calling this album punk rock. True, the corporate music industry has sadly defined a new punk rock genre that is not what we knew back in the day. That does not excuse this cacophony of vicious remarks on the personal character of Green Day fans (simply because they call Green Day punk). Whew! I apologize to those of you who don't care about whether Green Day are punk or not, this should have been a review but I think this needed to be said.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and plan on seeing it only once.  While it was very good, it was very disturbing. <br /> <br />This movie deals with the characters fall into a drug induced world and the horrible consequences that over take their world.  Each character has to deal with their addiction to drugs in their own way, one losing an arm, another slipping into a horrible world of sex for drugs, and another simply going crazy.
B0000024W3|1.0|I'm listening to this album for the first time right now.  I came to Amazon.com to see what other people have rated this album, and am surprised that some people gave it 5 stars! After reading some comments, one person said it took several years to like it!  I'm not going to wait that long, so I'll just give it 1 lousy star.  Look, here's a clue about how to recognize bad music: when the artists starts singing \\"la la la\\" like in the song Wigwam, that's a good indication that the song is NOT FININSHED YET!
B00079ZACM|5.0|Without doubt a film far before its time!  Excellent in alll departments, particularly the crowd scenes and the battle charges! A difficult time for British interests in the Middle East durung that period.<br /><br />John Clements played his part with care, understanding, and an outstandingly gifted  portrayal of a so called coward turned hero!<br /><br />Ralph Richardson also showed us his acting skills with a great performance of a somewhat naive but highly patriotic British military Officer.  King and country before anything.<br /><br />Marvellous scenes in pre-second world war Britain together with the post-Kitchener era in the Sudan!<br /><br />This film should have won the Accademy Award for that year 1939
B000DZIGDU|1.0|This film is disappointing on several levels. <br /> <br />In Swofford's world, there are no honorable servicemen. Every Marine is a failure who joined the military to escape jail, troubles at home or boredom with life; all Marines have trouble following the most basic of orders; and staff sergeants follow their platoons -- whose members never separate -- from basic training to specialty schools to deployment, kind of like how teachers in TV high school dramas follow their students to college. <br /> <br />This would be no big deal if there was a purpose to those portrayals, but there isn't. The pacing is torturously sluggish, the infantrymen are portrayed with a gung-ho \\"Semper Fi!\\" attitude that rarely exists among the people on the ground, and the random bits of anti-war dialogue from one of the Marines are so hilariously out-of-place they sound like a bad Robert Fisk impersonation.  <br /> <br />It's kind of like the director wanted to revel in the primal experiences of a Marine company about to go to war and explore the complex range of feelings of his characters, all while portraying them as pigs and idiots. So it's hard to drum up empathy with the cast, and it's especially difficult to see what the point of this movie is. <br /> <br />The movie's plot reminds me of Tigerland, another film that shows military guys gearing up for war without any of the actual combat. And there is something incredibly promising about exploring that experience -- the nervousness, fear and even anticipation of being sent to off to war and combat, fizzling out in odd feelings and frustration when it becomes clear war (for these guys) isn't going to actually happen. But this movie does almost nothing right in terms of capturing those feelings. It feels like a badly developed TV movie. <br /> <br />There were very few things I liked about Jarhead, but some of the comraderie sequences were decently funny and there were lots of nice shots of the Marines moving through the desert, set to catchy interpretations of traditional Arab music. Unfortunately neither of those things make the movie worth watching. When it was over I felt like I had wasted my time.
0316096199|4.0|I ordered this book because I read The Lovely Bones and couldn't put it down.  Not quite as excited about this piece, but I think that has to do with the emotional density of some of the work, especially since it is a memoir.  I would recommend it though because Alice Sebold is a powerful writer with amazing courage to have made it through those ordeals and then share them with the world.
B0007M22TI|5.0|I love celtic music and this one has beautiful people and music wrapped up in one. I even bought the music CD!
1400049628|4.0|I found most parts of the book enlightening, and am glad that I read it.  However, it still makes me wonder about what there could be faced should a different kind of zombie come about.  Say the 'virus' mutated, and allowed for faster and semi-intelligent zombies.  Although much of the book could remain unchanged, there would still need to be some tinkering too plans should this arise.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|What can i say?  <br /> <br />I'll keep it short and sweet because it really is this simple -  <br /> <br />If you liked the original cut of Sin City then prepare to go gooey eyed and weak at the knees for this extended version.  <br /> <br />Rodriguez and Miller have outdone themselves, pure genius and the extras are well worth the price of the disc alone.
B000002UHG|3.0|I had this CD for awhile.  liked it initially as I was wanting to hear more 'floyd'. It is a decent companion to the 'division bell' but overall it is a downer (theme wise)  Since it is dealing with his wife's battle with depression, that is the theme.  I lost interest with the album after awhile tho.  It is nice to have something from him again tho, someones title of \\"regaining his confidence' is true.  Rumor had it he was making another, but years have passed and nothing came out.  The album has some moments tho music wise, just wish it was more 'happier'.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|David Gilmour has certainly come a long way since his early Pink Floyd albums. His artistic nature has been released in On An Island and is running wild. From psychomelodic to jazz, the album presents a side of David that we haven't seen before.
B00005ATQM|5.0|Although iv'e had this album since it came out and knew it was an all time classic, i wondered how it would transfer to 5.1 surround sound. I wasn't to be disappointed, the sound fills the room and brings a whole new dimension to an already classic album. Even some of my friends who are not into Metallica have to admit that it sounds fantastic. A definite must for any Metallica fan or anyone into 5.1 DVD audio for that matter.
6305508550|3.0|The opening credits in Office Space say that the movie is based upon a collection of shorts.  This is evident as the movie rolls on.<br /><br />The first section shows everyman Peter dealing with the inanity of a fictitious high tech company.<br /><br />Then Peter gets hypnotized and develops a Chance-like zen quality where he simply decides that he no longer wants to go to the office.<br /><br />\\"I'm not going to go there anymore.\\"<br /><br />\\"Are you quitting?\\"<br /><br />\\"No.  I'm just not going to go.\\"<br /><br />Naturally, as in Being There, the simple truth leads to tremendous professional success.  This could have been developed into a funny theme where the simpleton rises through the company viewing the disfunctional working world through a simpleton's eyes.  But the screenwriter has different ideas.<br /><br />In the third part of the movie Peter decides that he and two co-workers will rip off the company with a computer fix.  Naturally this goes poorly and he is no longer the simple man of Act 2, but now a typical comic lead character.<br /><br />Office space is laugh-out-loud funny in spots.  It shoots fish in a barrel by pointing out how terrible the working life can be.  But it never really pulls together into a solid movie.<br /><br />It is cute and fun.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|David Lynch has a tendency to direct obtuse, artistic think-peices.  Often Lynch leaves the impression that he is filming dreamscapes which make perfect sense to him immediately upon waking, less sense as the day progresses, and little sense to the audience he is recounting the dream to.  The emotion is always intense and there is a place for this art, which alarms and threatens with only vague explanation.  The Straight Story is a remarkable narrative by any messure, but perhaps more remarkable considering it comes from Lynch.  The emotion is as intense as ever, but the plot is completely comprehensive and digestable.  A man embarks on a journey to make amends with his ailing brother using the feable means available to him.  Along the way his values and good nature are embued on those that he passes on his jouney.  The wisdom and revelations seem profound in their simplicity, and Lynch lets the strength of the story capture his audience.  Lynch's usual disorientation, confusion, and contradiction is cast aside to tell a remarkable story based on true events.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|just picked it up. I like it, after listing to it for the last few days, i will just say 'atom heart/meddle' acoustic sound is here again with the contemporary 'division bell' sound too.  Bottom line if you like the Division Bell and something mellow, this is for you.
B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|Tom Selleck is an all around actor who really makes this movie. Good entertainment. A real thriller.
B00008DDRX|5.0|I saw this as a kid in a theatre and it's haunted me for decades - it puts you in the middle of the 1970 lemans race - with Steve McQueen as the star.  I'm actually a filmmaker and I have a hard time figuring out how they incorporated documentary footage of the actual race so well with the \\"re-created\\" footage shot with the narrative in mind.  There is minimal dialoge which is refreshing - forcing you to watch the movie like you'd spectate a racing event - yet the narrative information is there in abundance on screen.  It's even more amazing to realize that McQeen had nearly won Watkins Glen right before this race and was planning on contesting it but the bond company forbade it in case he crashed and they couldn't finish  the movie.  Also turns out that this was the 'classic' year of Lemans, for soon afterwards they changed the course, and put restrictions on the cars because they went too fast.  if you like McQeen, cars, porsches, ferraris, and auto racing in general - this is a must-see - you'll love this film.  The crash sequences are out of this world - how they did them I will never know.  Sometimes I just watch it as a document of the race and the era.  It even has a great score.
B00005K3LW|4.0|The 3rd, and final, movie in the Die Hard Trilogy brings a dramatic close to this great series.  While not quite on the same level as Die Hard 1 & 2 (the original script was not meant to be part of this or any other series), Die Hard 3 is still a great movie.  Bruce Willis teams up with a White hating Samuel L Jackson as the two must work together as they race through New York solving various riddles in order to stop the bad guys.  A thrill ride you must see, especially if you've seen any of this series.  Definately worth owning.
0790737345|5.0|I love this movie, and have seen it many times. Could watch it many more, as well. It shows what some people can and will do for love. And what some SHOULD do, but won't.
B00007K02F|2.0|The movie was an attempt to tell the story in the book Jane Eyre, but it does not even come close to doing it justice.
0393327655|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book. I was looking to read a scholarly book in which the author made a reasoned, tightly-argued case for secularism. Instead, I found a volume of tired arguments, generalizations, and misunderstandings of Catholic beliefs and practice, and prejudice against Catholicism and Islam, while he gives a \\"free pass\\" to Reform Judaism and Buddhism (and lessens the 'blow' on any religion which supports Israel unquestioningly, including fundamentalist Protestantism). <br /> <br />I do not know enough about Muslim theology to determine whether or not he has the same lack of understanding and knowledge of it as he does Catholic theology.  Frankly, the book reeks of the same old anti-Catholicism that has plagued this country since before the anti-Catholic \\"Know Nothing\\" riots of the 19th century. <br /> <br />It's not a book advocating secularism; it's a book filled with half-truths and insinuations about Catholicism (and presumably Islam) in order to attack it (them). <br /> <br />I was surprised by this given the copious endnotes. <br /> <br />I don't recommend this book except to those interested in the study of the history of anti-Catholicism in this country.
B000E5N62U|5.0|Wow, what a winner this is!  This is the best thing that Donald Fagen has done since 1980's Gaucho.  Even better is it in my opinion then his second solo CD, Kamikiriad.  Matter of fact, this sounds exactly like a Steely Dan CD.  If you wouldnt have told me what it was, I might have asked you if this is some lost Steely Dan album from the early 80's they never released? So unlike the more funkier, jazzier newer releases by Steely Dan (although good, at times songs kinda run together, same beat, instrumentation, etc. This is smoother, better textured, and more musically diverse. A lot of the sound is in the mood of the Gaucho CD, but more musically adventurous.  Quite frankly, I am surprised that Donald Fagen could have come up with something this good, at this point.  It is a pleasure to hear a great classic artist come up up with something pleasing like this in 2006.  Hat's off to Fagen, another true gem to please his and Steely Dan fans!
B000053VAZ|5.0|I loved this movie. Johnny Depp is amazing in it. It definitely showcases his talents very well. And it shows that love is possible no matter what handicap you have. No matter the obstacle, love will find a way!
B00005NTJK|4.0|Benefit in my oppion sustaines classic rock in the 60's and 70's. I would pit this album in my Jethro Tull top 5. Because a little while later Jethro Tull started to cross over to a techno sound, and it was starting to sound like they were palying for fairies and pixes. <br /> <br />Benefit is a great cd from almost every aspect. Marvin Barre displayed, complex guitar riffs and mind-boggling, metal solos. Clive Bunker displayed great drum foundations, but this definatley wasn't his best album out of his 4. There were no drum solos and not enough drum leads. Glen Cornick had a great album aswell, not his best, but a great performance espectually on \\"Teacher.\\" Ian Anderson also had a great performance, but his lyrics just weren't deep enough compared to his lyrics in \\"Aqualung\\" and \\"Thick as a Brick\\". Some people might argue thay there wasn't enough flute, but i say there was just the right amount, espectually on \\"Sossity, You're a Woman.\\" Anderson's vocal were outstanding one of or the best part about this album. <br /> <br />I can't get enough of this underrated masterpiece. Benefit, will be a huge benefit to any1 who likes calssic rock. <br /> <br />Key Songs: <br />Inside  <br />Play in Time <br />To Cry you a Song <br />Teacher

B000683VI4|5.0|I finally rented this movie after hearing so many great things about it - and I'm so glad I did! This is the best movie I've seen a very long time...an amazing love story. When I saw the DVD on sale at target for ten bucks, I was in heaven! I've also read the book after watching the movie and I really enjoyed the book...but for some reason I love the movie so much more. The acting in this film is beyond words...it's really amazing. You feel like your there going through it with them. I would recommend this movie to anyone - it is a treasure. I never get tired of watching it...and I find myself discovering something new everytime. I wish everyone a love like this - a love that true...that deep and profound. Don't settle...for anything! I've also really enjoyed reading these comments. I did read one comment where someone said they felt the second love scene was really just about physical attraction and not a deeper connection. I understand what your saying and I totally respect your opinion. But I saw things differently. I saw the passion and the longing they had for each other...and how much they couldn't stand to be away from each other anymore. I could never see Allie being that passionate about or with Lon. And the scene where Noah and Allie see each other again for the first time in years gives me chills everytime I see it! It takes your breath away. They just look at each other...and it's amazing! Watch this movie with your soul mate or if your single like me - this movie gives you hope and something to look forward to. Enjoy!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|One should have many moods, and be unafraid to show them. This work plays out in a most enjoyable fashion, ranging from the silly (Night Zombies), to the sublime (Come On! Feel the Illinoise!), to the most serious (Casimir Pulaski Day).<br /><br />Keep your mind and ears open, and you will not be disappointed.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I had the opportunity to see the opera at the Opera House. I fell in love with it. I then went to the Theatre to watch the movie with my husband. It was just as great. Now I get to relive it again and again.
0800141849|4.0|I love this movie, but unfortunately, when I ordered it, I did not notice that it was not in widescreen format -- this was truly a disappointment!  Nor can I find the widescreen version on Amazon.com.  Other than that, I highly recommend the movie for all the reasons so well-stated by previous reviewers!
B000AMJDHY|4.0|This is a pretty good cd. Not amazing but better than most bands. Their sound is like a mixture of The Killers and Fall Out Boy. I have no idea what the person below was saying about how fall out boy is crap but they gave this 5 stars. that is ridiculous because if anything Panic! at the disco is a knockoff of fall out boy. The song names even sound exactly the same. But all in all if you like technoish rock then you should buy the cd.
B00000HYXB|3.0|I do like this album, and still listen to it from time to time, but as a \\"masterpiece\\" ... er, maybe not. Perhaps Blind Guardian has a following, and within their collection of works this rates at the top, but I have albums from metal bands I would rate much more highly: Therion (Secret of the Runes), or The Gathering (Mandylion), to name 2 \\"theme\\" album examples.
B000050XEI|2.0|Where's the beautiful and timeless music of _The Celts_, _Watermark_ (my favorite album ever), and _Shepherd Moons_? Definitely nowhere to be found on _A Day Without Rain_.  I had been disappointed with _The Memory Of Trees_, but at least that album still showed a spark of originality on songs like the title track, \\"Tea-House Moon\\", and a couple others. Though _A Day Without Rain_ has a few beautiful songs like \\"Wild Child\\" and \\"Fallen Embers\\", most of the album follows a totally predictable pattern. Will Enya ever return to her _Watermark_ and _The Celts_ glory days? I'm starting to lose my hopes.

0375507256|3.0|This was an unusual novel in that it really wasn't a novel but more of a series of essays ,written in different styles,and at the end difficult to conclude that there was a coherent theme. On the other hand, some of the writing was quite insightful and thought provoking.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I had to listen to this album 2 or 3 times before it really began to grow on me, but now it's one of my favorites. As a \\"work\\", it's excellent. If this represents the current \\"state of the art\\" in alternative music (it registers as alternative to me, anyway), then things are looking pretty good.<br /><br />Recommended highly.
0895260131|5.0|and should be required reading for every U.S. citizen who loves freedom, opportunity for those who wish to pursue it, the Bible and the red, white and blue.  This book provides clear explanation of the Islamic principles and counters with examples from the Bible.  True differences are pointed out and it is frightening when one invisions the possible future if we allow ourselves to let fear of bluntness and this notion called political correctness drive our actions.  Like one reviewer wrote, Bush really does need to read this book, as does every good U.S. citizen!
B00005JMXX|5.0|I loved this movie for the special effects and also the storyline.  Made me stop and think how true this could possibly <br />be and what may happen.  Would watch over again.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|My least favorite song on here is \\"Let it Well Be.\\"  My favorite song on here is \\"Future Lovers.\\"  I love this song because it's so different from anything she's ever done.  This song is best listened to while driving in your car with the volume pumped up.  I also really like \\"Push\\" and \\"Like it or Not.\\"
B00004STPT|5.0|I really like this CD.  I am currently indisposed so my discriptions are not so detailed.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I purchased this CD for the song \\"DIRTY\\" but I did enjoy a few other tracks. As a whole, the CD wasn't bad.

B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't at least a 2-Disc Special Edition of this movie. The movie is entertaining and gives another depth of the forever told story. It has also brought a lot of fans to Ms. Austen.<br /><br />I've been quite a fan of Jane Austen's books for quite a long time and have gotten to see the most beloved version of this story with Colin Firth. To all of those who have seen this version I strongly recommend that you try not to compare MacFadyen to Firth (I mean how can you?). And take it for its own interpretation of the book. (Although I was bit mad that they left out certain characters.) But all in all I'd recommend this movie.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Sure, You may see Hung Up and Sorry on TRL and Confessions... has already sold 2x what American Life did but, AL is still the better album.  Don't get me wrong, I like both albums.  American Life has more substance, more depth and better beats.  It has a great techno-vibe, and Confessions has this slow-dance feel (Forbidden Love, especially).  I almost feel that she sold out a little. American Life as a commerical failure in the US, so she retreated in these poppy, radio-friendly songs.  Again, I love Confessions...it just doesn't have the edge.  In American Life, Madonna wore army fatigues and harshly criticized American materialism (ironic isn't it) and it was tough and cool.  Confessions seems like generic pop music.  If you want an in-your-face, anti-materialism, honest album, buy American Life.  Go ahead and buy Confessions too... but American Life first.
B000002A3T|5.0|this is no mediocre floyd album.feeling and emotion are abundant throughout. throw this in the boombox on a great fishing day or on a long roadtrip; works best when listening by yourself in reflection!
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Walk the Line covers the early life of J.R. Cash beginning with his childhood in 1944. We saw his dirt-poor family picking cotton, his hardened-by-a-hard-life father giving no quarter, no rest, and no approval.  Jumping to 1952, the country boy in the Air Force was stationed in Germany where he bought his first guitar. After his hitch was up, he married his childhood sweetheart Vivian and moved to Memphis.  Vivian didn't share John's love of music and disapproved of him and his friends \\"making a band\\".  He stumbled upon Sun Records where he and his two friends recorded his first songs in 1955.  Cry, Cry, Cry and Hey, Porter debuted at #14 on the charts.<br /><br />John went on tour with other up-and-coming singers who had a new sound, a new look and a new attitude, among which were Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley.  Being on tour in those days did not mean having an advance crew, roadies, busses and vans: it meant a caravan of cars with the musicians and their instruments driving through the night to the next gig.  The young musicians relied on \\"uppers\\" to keep them going. John met June Carter at the Grand Old Opry in the late 1950s. They toured together for awhile.<br /><br />The movie depicts bad behavior: enjoying the groupies spawned by the new spate of young male rock and country singers, drinking, gulping down pills, missing or messing up performances, really embarrassing stuff.  There is a scene wherein June is angrily throwing beer bottles at the guys on stage at an afternoon `rehearsal' because they were drunk-it really happened!  Sudden fame is hard for anyone to handle and Johnny Cash was no exception.<br /><br />The meat of the story is how the young Johnny Cash found his own particular sound, how he nearly self-destructed and was saved, and how he and June finally came together.  Oddly enough, and fortunately for the director, all three threads of his story merged in 1968, so it was a good place to end the movie.  Walk the Line is not about the Living Legend Johnny Cash; it is about the young man trying to find his place in the world of the music he loved.<br /><br />You might wonder if certain scenes really happened, or did the writers put them in for dramatic effect?  The answer is yes, most of them really happened and no, a lot of what was shown is not in their biographies.  It was still too hard to talk about when they wrote them. John and June talked freely, however, to the writers and director who wanted to make a film of his life.  Johnny told the director that if he did this movie, not to leave out the bad parts.<br /><br />It's an honest movie, with award-winning performances by both Phoenix and Witherspoon.  Recommended.it is about the young man trying to find his place in the world of the music he loved.

1892005034|1.0|All the hype surrounding this book is for naught.  Rosenberg simply condensed (simplified) into a few pages the wisdom of all other self-help book writers.  Unremarkable.  For those members of the Church of NVC, please expand your reading library.
B00005NTN5|4.0|This movie is pretty good.  It's got some action, some romance, some mob stuff, and good acting.  The lesbian scenes are ok, nothing too graphic, it isn't a porno but it's more explicit than your average movie.  All the actors do a pretty good job except for the mob boss's son.  The only real downside to this movie is jennifer tilly's annoying voice.  It's a really interesting movie all the same. I recommend it if you like the italian job, or any kind of crime plotting/mob movie/lesbian movie.
B0006J28BO|5.0|This was my first viewing of a Studio Ghibli movie and I am very, very impressed.  The story of young Haru (Anne Hathway in the English dub), trying to find acceptance is truly spectactular.  The art work is nothing like you've ever seen, the colours vary from bold, soft, dark to reflect the scene you are seeing.  Even if you don't care for, hate or love or are neutral on anime this is a feature you can enjoy since it's not too simple or complex.  It's a refreshing movie that may remind you of the old Disney movies.  Though this movie is G it isn't too kiddy or (obviously) too adult.  Everyone from a small child to an adult can enjoy this.  You don't need to rent it first, this is worth adding to your collection!
B0006B2A2E|5.0|I agree with almost everyone, including some negative reviews.  When I first watched the film, the photography was difficult, the voices were obscure, and the film dragged for the first half hour.  However, by the end of the film, I realized I had watched a superbly acted film, with an equisitely crafted storyline.  I was confused by my conflicting feelings, so I watched it again the following day.  Armed with the knowledge from my previous viewing, the photography, sound and tempo were all just perfect.  I had missed much in my first viewing. <br />The fact that one may not relate to the actors to me is irrelevant.  This was a brutally frank study of relationships, expectations, and the futility of putting limits on emotions. <br />Every actor was at the height of their game, and this film is definitely worth your time.   <br />I suggest you not expect it to be a romantic or comedic film.  Just a study of 2 folks wrestling with being together.
1400043662|3.0|I like magical realism as much as the next person, but I'm not entirely satisfied with what Murakami has in this novel. Although there is a germ for several fascinating stories, none of them play out to a satisfying conclusion. There is an Oedipal subtext which is well done, even if the identity of the father is never known. But I found myself raging at the author for not doing anything with the intriguing characters of Johnnie Walker, Col. Sanders and some of the other characters that flitter in and out of the plot.<br /><br />His writing is beautful thoughout and I particularly enjoyed his thoughtful characterization of the gender-bending librarian and Kafka's possible mother.<br /><br />It's a book that will stay in my memory, hence the three stars. But I longed for a satisfying ending with some ends tied up, and didn't get that satisfaction.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|this movie is so good if you just call it requiem people will know what movie you're talking about.  good directing/cinematography. all the acting is great too, even the wayans brother.  you really feel for all the characters in this movie, some directors can make you care about 1 or 2 characters.  this director makes you care about all 4 of them. i'd recommend this if you like realistic/innovative directing/good acting/or drug movies.
B000A78Z82|5.0|I hesitated to write a review on Devendra's work for a while, just because I don't have enough time to put into it.  So, keep in mind that it is actually better than what I may say here.<br /><br />This is music is beautiful; from songs, to lyrics, to singing.<br /><br />You may ask yourself why is he obsessed with children?  You know, Chinese Children, I Feel Just Like a Child, and Long Haired Child... But I tell you - can one not have fun?  Put it on, enjoy!
1878424777|4.0|I learned a lot from listening to this CD.  I definitely goes into my \\"listen to more than once\\" collection of self-help CD's.<br /><br />The author does a good job explaining the Four Rules and why they would be life changing if we can adopt them.  I am still working on applying them to my life which is why I say I need to listen to them more than once.<br /><br />This book is good for anyone who wants an easy to understand beginner book to metaphysical philosophy.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|The best of a kung fu movie and british comedy. This movie is a delight.  <br />A beautiful weaving of the different story plots into one cohesive movie, bringing them all together seamlessly in the end.  <br />I loved it more the second, third ... each time I watch it the more I love it.
0143034901|5.0|I am an avid reader, reading dozens of books a year.  This book was far and away the best thing I have read since my last Saul Bellow.  It has mystery, intrigue, is well-written and is utterly captivating while making the reader feel that a work of great weight, depth and literacy, is being read.
0684824906|3.0|By overdone, I only mean to posit whether the subject could have been covered as well or better on a trifle fewer pages.  It is an excellent book.  I can not argue with the sagacity of the premise that these individuals - all forces in their own right - were used with such deftness by Lincoln towards his objectives. Certainly one would be hard pressed not to be impressed by the fresh look at the inner workings of  Lincoln team.  It is to be recommended to anyone who has been through the Lincoln biographies and for whom the true meaning of politics and the struggles of personalities and leadership are of interest. However, I can not help but feel, as do a few other reviewers that a good portion of the tail end of this book looks a bit like raw research being blurted onto the page.  It is still interesting, but less so than the beginning of the book. I find myself wishing for a stronger and more timely finish. So it is overdone by virtue of being raw.  There you go - I must be hungry again. Anyway, excellent book, enjoy it!
6305718954|5.0|Pauline Kael once said: \\"Movies are so rarely great that if we cannot appreciate great trash, we have very little reason to be interested in them\\".<br /><br />How right u were and R girl...

People love`m - despite \\"what-their-names-said\\" hehehe...<br /><br />On a level this is great trash, it isn`t The Exorcist, but a LOT more fun... Patricia Arquette is just ace in this one. Gabriel Byrne? Just as fun - he looks like my friend - the actor Andrew Raymond Barnes - they ARE LOOK-ALIKES:-)))<br /><br />On the whole it`s psychedelic, pretentious... but never... ever... boring....<br /><br />It`s goodlooking and the production values are first-rate:-)
B000066C6Z|5.0|Kidding! Just thinking about this movie cracks me up. Did I say that the In-Laws was funny? Now, THIS movie is a riot! OK, now so it is a Zukerman film so be prepared for some potty humor and if your comedy is very high brow, well you may not appreciate the fine artistry of this comic genius. However, for those of you who are NORMAL (as opposed to \\"abby normal\\") you will laugh your ____ off! By the way, Val Kilmer plays a great \\"straight man\\" and you will actually be amazed at his performance as a rock star - not bad at all. So tempted to repeat my favorite spoilers - but won't. Hillaryeous!
6305280762|5.0|The 70s brought a cycle of catastrophe-films(revived in the 90s), and none was better than this all-star-cast epic. It`s brilliant.

1401200923|2.0|I don't read many comic books, but I enjoy Batman and I enjoy talented artists. The artwork in this comic book is awesome ... great drawings, great use of color. The storyline, however, is amateurish. Admittedly, you must approach all fictional writing with a degree of \\"suspension of disbelief\\", however this pushes the bounds of what is tollerable. Spoiler: c'mon ... a 10 year old boy wants his parents to die so he can be an orphan? And then plots his revenge against Bruce Wayne for 25+ years after his Bruce's dad was able to save the mother? DESPITE now himself being a world famous physician? The plot brings every villan into suspicion ... seems like a weak attempt to get all of Batman's most famous enemies on the cover to sell more comics. The writer gave us no sense of the torment of the antagonist, no real motive. Were his parents abusive? Why the displaced agression towards Bruce? The writer wasted valuable storyline on dead ends rather than building real suspense and drama. I am going to continue to read Batman graphic novels in hopes that there is something better than this out there. I wished the writing lived up to the art work.
0307276902|5.0|A Million Little Pieces by James Frey is a chilling, detailed, honest acclaim of battling addiction. James Frey entrances you and you find yourself satisfied with his success. <br />     The novel is about James, a drug addict, alcoholic and criminal since adolescence. After knocking on death's door, James I sent to one of the greatest rehab clinics in the country. There, he finds love, friends, and finds himself. <br />     They way Frey tells the story is so gripping that it keeps you from putting this incredible book down. His neglecting of all grammatical correctness is compelling in that you are hearing the experience with Frey right in front of you. It is a fascinating tale of tragedy and triumph that should be read by most everyone at least once. Regardless of the controversy surrounding Frey's account of fact or fiction, the novel is entrancing and praise is well deserved.

B00008AY3L|1.0|I second the comment from M. S. Hillis.  The copy protection on the new ben harper cd means I won't be buying it.  Further, if you go to the virgin website and try to leave feedback your message is not accepted.  I guess that explains why they never get any complaints... <br /> <br />I simply hope this is not a problem that will occur with all virgin releases - if it is, guess I'll have to listen to different labels.
B00005221M|5.0|This is really a wonderful movie to watch.  Visually it is beautiful-just plain good story telling about real events.
B00000JSJC|5.0|I've read some ridiculously bad reviews of this movie by people who lack the intelligence to understand it. <br /> <br />This is how a dark movie should be folks. <br /> <br />*****SPOILER read on*********** <br /> <br />All parts of movie are great but for me when Mace (Angie Basset) is getting beat with night sticks by the evil cops...and this young black kid fights back and the whole crowd jump in...you want to jump out of your seat it is so exhilirating! :)
B000E1YVZU|5.0|This movie is a perfect specimen of what a musical gone movie should look like.  This movie is very powerful with wonderful vocals  and a life changing storyline that touches the viewers heart.  I am watching this movie for the first time, without hearing the original broadway musical and I am telling you that this movie is perhaps the most entertaining and inspirational movie I have seen in a long time. The acting is great and the energy that is presented is felt right thought the screen. Great movie!!!!!

0783225903|1.0|Really this satirical take on Orwells 1984 is nothing more than a messy arthouse flick. I first saw this movie back in the 80s, my ex-brotherlinlwa was raving about it,to be honest I thought it wasa load of crap back. <br />Acouple of weeks ago, I picked it up for ten bucks at movie warehouse, and thought I would give it another go, well I really struggled to stay awake when I watched it last sunday, and my verdict is the same as it was back in the 80s, \\"a load of old toss\\". Don't waste your money.
B00005KHL5|5.0|\\"The Landlord's daughter\\" \\"Cornriggs and Barleyriggs, and...CORN RIGGS ARE BONNNNYYYYY\\" With one of the all-time best soundtracks (the songs are absolutely amazing!), and a great story of a modern-day society living according to Pagan rituals, a great setting on an Isle of the coast of Scotland (Summer Isle) and a great cast (including the great CHRISTOPHER LEE!! as Lord SummerIsle), this movie is a must-see. Like a fine-wine, this film gets better with age. The more you see it, the more you have to see it. The Wickerman could be one of the most underrated films in history; it is truly a masterpiece. The film is very hard to come by, and try to get the full length 107 minute version (although, in a pinch, the 98 minute version will suffice). If you buy/rent it, you must watch it at least twice in a row, to appreciate the sheer genius of the film. Is it a horror? Well, not really. It defies categorization.
B000AYQJJ2|4.0|I was elated to find a DVD of this pioneer concert.  The Billy Preston performance is worth the purchase price.
B00005JOFO|5.0|The greatest reviews for this film are, in a sense, the many thoughtful reactions of people on the Ultimate Brokeback Forum:  [...]     These people have created a supportive internet community where people sort through their feelings of elation and depression occasioned by this profound film. Many people have reflected on their lives and begun important changes as a result.

But this book will make you laugh- a book full of gentle humour. These are quoted from the 1st page of this book, 'Here are a few random secrets of mine, off the top of my head: 1. My Kate Spade bag is a fake... 4. I weigh 128 pounds. Not 118, like my boyfriend, Connor, thinks... 6. Sometimes, when we're right in the middle of passionate sex, I suddenly want to laugh... 8. I've already drunk the wine that Dad told me to save for twenty years... \\" See, all women should understand those little secrets, right? :-)
B00005JOWF|1.0|Violet (Jovovich) is a Hemophage, infected with a blood sickness.  Hemophages are exiled from society and actively hunted down.  With the disease though comes extraordinary agility, strength, and dexterity.  Violet is the Hemophages' best hope to deal with Daxus (Chinlund), the military leader.  Violet's job is to find the doomsday weapon he has created, and destroy it.  The doomsday weapon is a child named Six (Bright), and when Violet is unable to kill him, her own people set out to find her too.<br /><br />\\"Ultraviolet\\" is a bad movie.  The acting is bad, the special effects are bad, the fight scenes are bad, the dialogue is bad, and even the story itself is less than stellar.  These are too many stikes for the film to overcome and whet is left is a laughable mess.  Sadly, the opening credits are the most engaging part of the film, and seem to hint at the promise of something good.  Do not bother with this movie, even on DVD.
B0002A2WDQ|2.0|Aside from an inspired performance by the late Joe Seneca, this film is a throwaway. Joe's character, Willie Brown, is the only one we care about.  Ralph Macchio is every bit as annoying as he'd been in the Karate Kid and the story...well, Joe wants to break a contract with the devil.  Need I say more?  The final showdown with the dark lord won't put any of your neck hairs on end, and the outcome will be predicted by your 12-year old.  But also in that scene late in the movie, there's some pretty flashy guitar picking going on, thanks to uncredited virtuoso Steve Vai.  Hallelujuh for that part.

B00006L7XQ|2.0|You got to be a die-hard Johnny Cash fan in order to like this CD. Johhny gives it his all, but it's a sad ending to a wonderful career. Johnny's voice is shaky, and he can only hit notes at a very limited range. Many times he's off-key, and background singers have to carry the songs. Even with the help of great sound mixers, this CD is pathetic. All-in-all, if you rate this CD as a tribute to a great star and a great career and ignore it's flatness, you will obviously love it. If you want to buy it for Johnny's singing ability, forget it. This CD isn't for you.

B00008IAMD|5.0|Rather than talk about the entire album, which is really great, I just want to remark about \\"When the Man Comes Around\\" In the liner notes he mentions he never spent more time writing a song than this one. It truly shows as this is arguably the most finely crafted ballad of his wonderful life. I have never heard or read a more intuitive and profound interpretation of the \\"Book Of Revelations.\\" The theologians have always been mystified by this work, but the piece withstands any criticism. This is a genuine message being expressed through a worthy messenger and it's being expressed in a way that listeners can relate to. That's really what poets and troubadors do and maybe Mr.Cash was the last great troubadour of the 20th century; anyway, I'll miss his music and I'll miss his kind ways.

B00005RZV4|5.0|Ever since Trent Reznor and his band made a mud-drenched splash as Woodstock 1994, almost all music fans have known that Nine Inch Nails put on a fantastic live show. NIN's first live disc (which was recorded on the \\"Fragility: 2.0 Tour\\") proves that their live songs make their original, studio versions sound tame and controlled. \\"And All That Could Have Been\\" is about as intense and full of vitriol as industrial metal gets. And, from the opening wallop of \\"Terrible Lies\\" to the dark, introspective \\"Hurt,\\" which closes out the album, every song is a hit.<br /><br />The crowd is only rarely audible, and they know when to shut up (like during the ballads), so the audience noise never gets in the way of the music.<br /><br />Tracks like \\"Terrible Lies,\\" \\"Head Like A Whole\\" (both singles from NIN's 1989 debut, \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\") and \\"Starfers, Inc.\\" pack a powerful, cathartic, adrenalized punch. Plus, these songs sound even louder and crisper, here, than in the studio. Elsewhere, electronic frenzied, techno-lite cuts like \\"Sin\\" and \\"March Of The Pigs\\" are heavy on new-wave keyboards, and \\"Piggy,\\" \\"The Frail\\" (a piano interlude), and \\"The Great Below\\" are very slow and ambient. Songs like \\"Suck\\" and \\"Closer\\" bring the best of both worlds; these songs have a stomping rhythm section married with synths and other atmospheric instruments. And, lastly, the ballads (\\"The Day The World Went Away\\" and \\"Hurt\\") are very touching and beautiful.<br /><br />So, this album *IS* all that it could have been, and more. It's no less than great, and it's as close to being perfect as live albums get nowadays.
B000021Y7X|5.0|I bought this with the knowledge that this was a grea concert to begin with but never have I seen it.  It is a regular concert legnth with many sub sections and different performances.  It has excellent sound quality (5.1 DD, and 5.1 theatrical surround, and ofcourse stereo).  the images is in 16:9 execpt for the two bonus songs, they are 4:3 and of much less sound and video quality but still great to watch.

B00005K3NY|4.0|Updated for Blu-ray:<br /><br />Please Note: Because Amazon combines these reviews into a hodge podge mixing old, new, domestic and imports in many cases, I've revised this review to include both the Criterion new release (7/15/14) and the original MGM DVD. Unfortunately, Amazon still doesn't get (or care) that a re-release of a title isn't like a book where there's little variation beyond the cover and type face and there are sometimes massive differences between the original version and reissues.<br /><br />Best remembered for the exploding heads seen in the film, \\"Scanners\\" is more than a shock horror film combining director David Cronenberg's interest in creepy conspiracies (indeed, the paranoid conspiracy of \\"Scanners\\" could have come from a Philip K. Dick novel)and much larger themes about humanity.<br /><br />Criterion's blu-ray release more than one-up's the DVD from MGM; the film is the best it has ever looked with a sharper image due to the 2k restoration and transfer done by Criterion (supervised by Cronenberg himself).<br /><br />What truly distinguishes this set aside from the transfer are the healthy amount of special features included. We get Cronenberg's film \\"Stereo\\" which is thematically related to \\"Scanners\\". We also get a new interview with actor Michael Ironside discussing the making of the film. \\"The Ephemerol Diaries\\" is a 2012 interview with lead actor Stephen Lack. Cronenberg himself appears in a 1981 interview excerpt from his appearance on the CBC's \\"The Bob McLean Show\\".<br /><br />Rounding out the special features is a new documetnary on the making of the film \\"Scanners Way\\" documenting the visual effects for this groundbreaking film and the production issues Cronenberg faced.<br /><br />We also get a booklet with an essay by author and film critic Kim Newman.<br /><br />The set features both a 2 disc DVD (movie and special features)and a single Blu-ray (both).<br /><br />My only complaint is with the packaging. Although handsomely designed, I'm not a fan of cardboard packaging that Criterion has lately gone to for many of their releases. The packaging is flimsy compared to a Blu-ray case and, although the case that holds the discs is protected in a cardboard slipcase, overall I believe these type of cases don't stand up to wear and tear as well as plastic ones AND if you need to replace the case due to damage, there's not much one can do. This is a minor complaint but I do wish that Criterion would listen to their many customers and go back to the plastic cases with a slip case.<br /><br />MGM DVD ORIGINAL RELEASE REVIEW:<br /><br />David Cronenberg's \\"Scanners\\" was the first film I saw by this imaginative director. Cronenberg's film may lack the big budget of a Hollywood production but what it lacks in money it makes up for in an imaginative well executed story. This tackles the same story (essentially although it should be noted that Cronenberg had the idea well before \\"The Fury\\" release)as Brian DePalma' \\"The Fury\\" and while it lacks true star presence in the lead role the supporting cast more than makes up for it. It's not a perfect film (some of the performances by the actors come across very flat)and it lacks the sure hand that guided \\"The Fly\\", \\"Dead Ringers\\" and \\"Videodrome\\" but the fire and intelligence is there.<br /><br />Cameron Vale (Stephen Lack)believed to be schizoidphrenic because he constantly hears other voices in his head is recruited by Paul Ruth (Patrick McGoohan) to help track down a man named Darryl Revok(Michael Ironside. Revok like Vale is a scanner--someone who can read other people's other thoughts but it seems that a scanner like Revok can also be used as a weapon. Revok has other plans--he doesn't just want to be the weapon but use his skills to rule. Vale allies himself with Kim Obrist the only person he finds he can trust in this war between Ruth's company Consec and Revok.<br /><br />Stephen Lack (as noted elsewhere)has a complete LACK of presence in the role. Luckily McGoohan and Ironside more than make up for his weak performance with strong, eccentric and memorable performances. O'Neill is only slightly better and appears to be in this film only so it could get U.S. distribution after the success of \\"The Summer of '42\\". Regardless of the film's deficits Cronenberg's thoughtful visual and gory film (hey a head explodes)demonstrates his flowering ability as a director.<br /><br />The transfer looks pretty good in this transfer to DVD while there aren't any extras beyond the movie trailer, the film itself comes unedited. A commentary track from Cronenberg would have been nice but given that this was released in 2001 on DVD and this probably isn't a huge seller (more a cult film now)I'm not surprised that it comes so bare bones. Still the price is right.ily McGoohan and Ironside more than make up for his weak performance with strong, eccentric and memorable performances.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|This is the first David Gilmour album I've purchased - being more of a Pink Floyd fan, but having owned this album for a week now; I can confirm OAI in my opinion is excellent. Yes, it's generally fairly slow paced, but that doesn't make it bad. The people who seem to think Gilmour can't produce a decent song without Roger Waters are in the main, totally blinkered to the waters style of writing. This isn't a Waters or a Floyd album. OAI sounds just great the way it is. Waters penned lyrics would be totally daft on such a beautiful set of musical tracks as these, tracks that all relate to Gilmour's past. Polly may have added most of the lyrics but the music is all Gilmour's - and the music came first. <br /> <br />Gilmour has finally been released from the burden of Floyd to produce music the way he wants to, and that makes OAI a pure pleasure to listen to. It still has the Floyd sound in places - how could it not. But this is a David Gilmour album. Slow sensual songs with wonderful guitar peaks in all the right places. The whole album works wonderfully as a single musical piece, but made up of many different musical styles. Highly recommended to anyone that likes mellow, thought provoking music. <br /> <br />This review was written without any `Robotic loyalty'. Everyone's entitled to an opinion, not just the people who expected something different, and then come back to knock OAI because it doesn't sound like a 29 year old Pink Floyd album that they'd all been wishing for. OAI is David Gilmour, not Pink Floyd.
B000069AUI|4.0|To me, a great band is one that achieves exactly what it sets out to do. Of course, it's a bonus if the band happens to share aesthetics similar to my own, but that doesn't necessarily have to be the case. With Coldplay, they have reached their goal of creating a catalog of melodic and engaging songs, and this is only their second album! A Rush of Blood to the Head adds a bit of muscle to their lush debut, Parachutes, so it may take some getting used to by fans of that album, but it isn't really all that different. Chris Martin is still obsessed with emotional self-control, love (or the lack of it), and songs that contain no fat. In this case, that means no solos, no flashy interplay, and no excessive lingering on predictable and/or redundant song structure.<br /><br />A Rush of Blood to the Head is the kind of album that screams out to be a critic's favorite, but it also has everything it needs to be populist, too. It doesn't take long to recognize the album as one of the year's best. There are moments that are earth-shatteringly gorgeous, due as much to the tasteful interplay of the band members as to Martin's rich melodies. Martin consistently writes the most engaging and original melodies since...boy, it's been a while since we've had an album this melodic, hasn't it? \\"In My Place\\" is so lush that it's something of a miracle, managing to sound like an understated anthem of sorts. \\"The Scientist\\" deserves some type of award for plain greatness but if you're suffering from a broken heart, you might want to avoid it, since its lyrical content is as sad as it is addictive;  \\"Nobody said it was easy, It's such a shame for us to part.<br /><br />  Nobody said it was easy, no one ever said it would be this hard.<br /><br />  Oh, take me back to the start.\\"<br /><br />Just as sad and lovely is \\"Warning Sign,\\" as the cry in Martin's voice rises, singing, \\"but the truth is, I miss you.\\" It's the understated simplicity of it all that makes the song so effective.<br /><br />Throughout the disk, the musicianship is near perfect, remaining understated and in dedicated service to the song. Coldplay is so refreshing as a band because they don't hide behind pretense or studio gadgetry to cut through, just beautifully formulated tones and intelligently constructed parts that suit the mood of each song. Repeated listening reveals the formula of Martin often performing the first verse solo before the band joins in, but it works so well that it barely deserves mention. I have little doubt that I'll love this album in twenty years as much as I do now.  A  Tom Ryanthe disk, the musicianship is near perfect, remaining understated and in dedicated service to the song.

B0000033K2|4.0|The conundrum of John Coltrane's career was that he was one of the most focused and dedicated horn players of all time, while continually searching for something that apparently always remained just beyond his grasp. His tenure with Atlantic Records captures the time that Coltrane came into his own, as a bandleader with a vision, and yet it also captures the restlessness of that vision, and its ability to continually transform itself into something outside his grasp. In this way, Coltrane's music is very much like life itself; while moments of self satisfaction and peace of mind are obtainable for a short while, our very nature as human beings makes certain that anything so desirable remains tenuous. Listen to Coltrane as he stretches out and his dedication to the music is beyond reproach and cannot be questioned. He lived his music as a metaphor for life, and that is why his approach to jazz has endured the test of time. His questions are eternal, and the flashes of brilliance that seem to provide answers, however fleeting, make the quest almost heroic in nature.<br /><br />The Heavyweight Champion is subtitled `The Complete Atlantic Recordings' for good reason. The seven disks included herein compile every known recording that exists in Atlantic's catalog. While such exhaustively inclusive box sets usually indicate that there will be endless repetition, false starts and abandoned ideas, that is not the case here. With the exception of disk seven, which is deliberately segregated from the rest of the box because it documents (quite fascinatingly, actually) a recording session with all of its stops, starts and musical revisions, this box set contains no more than two takes of any given title. The reason for this is that the warehouse where Atlantic's tapes of all unreleased sessions (again, with the exception of disk seven) were stored was destroyed by fire. However unfortunate the historic consequences of this disaster might have been, the result is a well-focused collection of music that portrays John Coltrane as one the most restless and insightful musicians of his (or any) age.<br /><br />All in all, Coltrane recorded thirteen sessions for Atlantic, dating from January 1959 through May 1961. Considering, then, how this collection represents only two and change years of Coltrane's legacy, it is remarkable to hear how much growth and change had taken place in so short a time, especially since it all sounds as if it evolved naturally, rather than from commercial or business influences. Coltrane followed his own muse - often into a corner - but it was his willingness to risk himself that draws any attentive listener inside his vision, trying to see just what he was reaching for. Like Coltrane himself, this box set doesn't provide any unequivocal answers, but it does provide all of the recorded evidence that exists, which means that all the questions are right here to behold. And, as anybody familiar with such things already knows, the way to discovery is in asking the right questions.<br /><br />A-  Tom Ryanction of music that portrays John Coltrane as one the most restless and insightful musicians of his (or any) age. <br />All in all, Coltrane recorded thirteen sessions for Atlantic, dating from January 1959 through May 1961.

I passed through my teenage years quoting Dr. Dyer & believing what he states in this book. I really think it helped me to take some very good & important decisions in my life. I decided to buy it now because I had the spanish version (My first language) & I wanted to refresh my memory but in English.

B00000GAIW|5.0|On a whim and a one-click-to-buy impulse I finally bought the CD of this classic Jethro Tull album the other day. It's been many years since I listened to my scratchy old vinyl copy, but I remember now why it was one of my favorites.  <br /> <br />Aqualung was released in the early '70s. There was an awful lot of  \\"progressive rock\\" around in those days, produced by myriad groups like Yes and Emerson, Lake and Palmer. It was an era of Great Pretension. The murky and inane lyrics of practically illiterate English rock stars were subjected monthly to fawning exegesis in the pages of Rolling Stone, and the music was heavy with ethereal (and still novel) banks of synthesizers and 20-minute drum solos. <br /> <br />In the midst of this abysmal arena-based \\"serious art rock\\" era, Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson (J.T. is a group, not a person) produced a work of real intellectual content, a searing indictment of organized religion and hypocritical society. Perhaps the targets are a bit obvious, but they're the perennial ones, especially tasty to the nascent alienated adolescent. Aqualung has, unlike so many other works of that era, aged well to my ears. The signature Tull sound of acoustic guitar, flute, \\"English folk\\" style melodies and raw heavy metal realized on this classic was never surpassed even by the group themselves. Guitarist Martin Barre's bank of Marshalls blisters throughout. It is a rocking album that tells all the organized institutions, the ones you're learning to hate at 15, to stuff it. Yeah, it was just the right thing at just the right time for me. <br /> <br />I remember listening to that lime-green Chrysalis 8-track tape over and over through my first car's puny stereo speakers, as they emitted a puff of dust at the first power chords of \\"My God.\\"  <br /> <br />There was a time I was convinced Ian Anderson was the greatest musical genius in rock. He tried too hard in later years, though, and produced stuff as pretentious and self-indulgent as anyone. (What the hell was A Passion Play all about?)  Ian has retired the tights and codpeice but is still living well, a salmon farmer in the English countryside. A grayer but (I hope) still angry Tull tours the U.S. regularly. Their best lyrics are as relevant as ever: <br /> <br />If Jesus saves-well, He'd better save Himself <br /> <br />from the glory glory seekers who use His name in death... <br /> <br />-Hymn 43 <br />

B00004S35Z|5.0|In the period of time from 1971-1976, Stevie Wonder could do no wrong.  His output during this stretch is truly unassailable, and it isn't likely that any artist of any genre will ever have such a prolific period again.  That is probably the reason that Fulfillingness' First Finale, released in the middle of this time frame, doesn't consistently receive the praise that is routinely heaped upon Stevie's other albums from this era.  Nevertheless, Wonder's \\"forgotten child\\" is a masterful achievement that ranks right up there with the other three classics he recorded at that time. <br /> <br />On FFF, Wonder compiles an eclectic group of songs touching on various topics, but manages to tie them together with a commonality that isn't matched on his previous effort, Innervisions, or his next, Songs in the Key of Life.  The most recognizable track to most listeners is the funk/reggae hybrid \\"Boogie On Reggae Woman\\" which Stevie whips into a soulful stew with great interplay between the piano, synthesizers and harmonica (all played by Wonder, of course).  Then there's the scathing social commentary, \\"You Haven't Done Nothin'\\".  The best way to describe this track is ludicrously funky.  The ambiguously trippy anti-drug song, \\"Bird of Beauty\\", is one of the most bizarre tracks in the Stevie Wonder canon, and it is juxtaposed next to one of his most straightforward and plaintive soul numbers, \\"Please Don't Go\\". <br /> <br />So, how does he make these seemingly disparate tracks fit together as a cohesive album?  It's hard to say, exactly, but it works.  Musically, many of the tracks have an ethereal, dreamy quality.  Wonder makes use of more backing vocals than usual, adding another texture to several songs, and the harmonica playing is some of his best ever.  The most evident thread throughout the album, though, is Stevie's honesty.  This may be his most candid album.  Obviously, he's candid on all of his recordings, but he has never worn his heart so plainly on his sleeve.The pair of spiritual songs are vastly different in sound, but equally bold and truthful in subject.  \\"Heaven is 10 Zillion Light Years Away\\" attacks (or rather, counter-attacks) critics of Christianity with the same verve that \\"You Haven't Done Nothin'\\" calls out the government.  \\"They Won't Go When I Go\\" is a sad, brutally honest, piano-driven track about the fate of non-believers who are close to him.  It's a real issue any faithful person deals with, even though no one likes to talk about it.  The frank break-up song \\"It Ain't No Use\\" is a fantastic kiss-off, and  \\"Too Shy to Say\\" is the most gut-wrenching unrequited love song since Van Morrison's \\"Cyprus Avenue\\".  The album is rounded out with the lush opener \\"Smile Please\\" and the delirious \\"Creepin'\\".  Somehow it all comes together to form a forceful artistic statement that has rarely been matched. <br /> <br />Fullfillingness' First Finale is easily the least accessible of Stevie's classic records.  Even the title is unwieldy.  It is a mature album, and Wonder's stark delivery doesn't really invite the listener in, nor does the lack of pop hooks.  Once you do give it a listen (and a few more), however,  the layers begin to peel away and you start to uncover a beautiful work of art.  If FFF had been released by another artist, we would laud it as a supreme, career-defining statement.  It seems for Stevie Wonder, in the 70s, that was simply par for the course. <br />
0060899190|5.0|This book is superb as it really breaks down walls and the idea that it isn't okay to speak the truth.  Each secret revealed in this book reveals a little bit about each of us that we either knew was there but didn't want to admit it or something that we never realized about ourselves.  As I turned the pages I kept saying to myself, \\"I've thought that all the time\\" or \\"I feel the exact same way\\".  It's nice to find out you're not alone with your deepest demons.  There is someone out there like you and you don't have to know who it is because it is just a comfort to know that you are not alone.
B00006IRJU|4.0|Easily their strongest album since the Flowers' debut, Man of Colours was to become Icehouse's commercial and creative high point.  Had you seen them back in the day, you may remember the ladies swooning for frontman Iva Davies.  Beyond the rock star good looks, he is a talented songwriter who, as the album title suggests, can paint a vivid picture with simple words.    Like much of Icehouse's work, the overall feel of the record is somewhat moody and melancholy, but with hints of optimism.  The melodies are consistently catchy and moments of pure pop abound throughout.  \\"My Obsession\\" is a slice of radio-ready pop heaven about being in denial over lost love.  The album tracks reveal even deeper treasure, from up-tempo rocker \\"Nothing Too Serious\\" to the neo-Western setting of \\"Heartbreak Kid\\".  Man of Colours has an almost voyeuristic feel, as if walking downtown from window to window, peering in on the characters inside and getting a different story each time - good, bad and ugly - then hopping in the car on a warm, overcast night and going for a slow drive with the top down.    Time has not necessarily been kind to the production here.  In particular, cheesy synths and the big, echoey snare sound can ocassionally be distracting and place the album firmly in the 80's, dating it somewhat.  But beyond those minor missteps, the record remains as enjoyable a listen today as it was in 1987.    For those familiar with the original U.S. version of this album, you'll notice a few differences on this imported reissue.  Firstly, the remastering is superb and very warm-sounding, revealing depth in fidelity not heard when this album was first issued on CD early in the digital age.  \\"Crazy\\" is present in its shorter, single remix, and \\"Electric Blue\\" is likewise a slightly different mix (possibly also a single remix).  Two of the bonus tracks come from 1989's Great Southern Land and were exclusive to that compilation, now out of print, so it's nice they included them here.  Some of the relevant b-sides are also present but it would have been more rewarding to round up all of the stray, long-lost b-sides rather than including mostly boring, extended mixes of the album's biggest hits.    If you haven't heard this album in years or are looking for an entry into romantic pop, this is an excellent starting point.

B000BQ7BX2|4.0|This 11-disk set collects recordings by the late Gary Bertini and the  Cologne Radio Symphony orchestra into a full Mahler symphony set. It  includes the 9 complete symphonies, \\"Das Lied von der Erde\\", and the  adagio from the unfinished tenth. The recordings are from the late 1980s  and early-mid 1990s; some are live, some studio. Some of this material  has been available on earlier EMI releases, through the Musical Heritage  Society, and perhaps elsewhere. The result is a set of fine performances  at an excellent price.    A comment on the sound: its very good throughout. However there's  slightly more dynamic compression than is typically used in current  recordings. Some audiophile purists may find that unfortunate, but not  objectionable. Frankly, it makes these performances more listenable when  portable or on the road.    Bertini, born in what is now Moldova, developed his career primarily in  Israel. He is not well known in the US. So I turned first to the booklet  packed in the box, and its colorful essay by Kyo Mitsutoshi, a Tokyo  based music critic. Mitsutoshi quickly dismisses the pantheon of  venerable Mahler conductors from Walter to the present day, telling us  that in the Bertini recordings we will hear nothing at all resembling  those legendary interpretations. Rather we should expect a Mahler of  \\"florid beauty\\", \\"the pinnacle of Mahler interpretation\\". So it was with  considerable trepidation that I ventured into these recordings, and have  now listened through all 11 disks. I am delighted to report that these  performances are nowhere near as bad as the liner essay had led me to  expect! Perhaps Mitsutoshi's hyperbole is exacerbated by a poor  translation. But relax, it is only Mitsutoshi's prose which is \\"florid\\".    Nevertheless, Bertini's approach is one which firmly places Mahler at  the height of late 19th century romanticism, rather than at the vanguard  of 20th century musical ferment. This is most evident in the slowest  passages, whichBertini often takes quite slowly indeed. The finale of  the third clocks in at 26 minutes, more than 3 minutes longer than  Horenstein's reading. The last movement of the ninth is nearly four  minutes longer than Solti's. Does it work? Well, Bertini wants us to  hear the lyrical side of Mahler, and he masterfully draws that out to a  limpid simplicity that is refreshing for the jaded Mahler ear. In  Bertini's tempos and instrumental balance, I hear things I've not heard  before. Mahler's slower, introspective passages are interpreted in a way  that makes audible new aspects of Mahler's genius of orchestration.    But what's missing in these tender passages, is the quiet desperation  which should be simmering below the surface. Bertini eschews most stock  Mahleresque technique. There is little of the rubato we have come to  expect woven into the fabric of Mahler, or the supple shifts from light  to shadow, summoning and dismissing moments of desolation and hope  within a few bars.    Instead, Bertini relies more on traditional romantic, sweeping contrasts  of tempo and dynamics. And there certainly are powerful contrasts here.  If some of Mahler's genius is lost, its done so intentionally in the  service of Bertini's rigorous romantic vision. But something is indeed   missing, when landler movements evoke confident waltzers gliding   over polished floors, rather than tentative, lilting country dancers.    But there are plenty of times when Bertini's vision works magnificently.  The Cologne orchestra puts tremendous resources of sinewy brass and  silky strings at the conductors command, and Bertini knows how to use  them. The epic opening movement of the 3rd is wonderful indeed, building  controlled long dynamic lines and delivering satisfying, measured  crescendos on target.    Some performances warrant special note: the middle movement of the fifth  is very nicely done; the orchestra is caught up in a wild whirl, while a  strident horn seeks rapprochement with a frenzied orchestra. The eighth is   a fine live performance, paced quite smartly. Conductors have long  differed over interpretation of the popular adagietto of the fifth.  Bertini splits the difference here, opening at quite a quick clip, but  slowing as it progresses. The total run time of 10 minutes is somewhere  between Zander's fast lilt and Bernstein's funereal rendering.    The \\"Das Lied\\" is the gem of this set. The orchestral textures are  wonderfully transparent. The songs for the tenor, which in some  performances serve as intermissions between the mezzo's songs, are  decisively rescued from this fate by Ben Heppner. Marjana Lipovsek gives  a heartfelt performance with more spirit, (and less gratuitous  portamento) than on her recording with Solti. There's a drive and  urgency here which is quite a surprise after listening through Bertini's  10 symphonies, with not an inappropriately languishing tempo lingering  anywhere. I think this will become one of my very favorite Das Lieds.    I've been riveted by Mahler's music since I discovered it when I was 17,  many years ago. I no longer seek definitive performances, but hunger to  hear the richness of Mahler mined by a variety of artists. This set  offers a lot to explore. I would discourage someone relatively new to  Mahler from springing for this set, despite the attractive price.  Instead, pick and choose from recordings which lie more to the center of  the received tradition. But if you've been there and done that, continue  your journey with these fine, if eccentric performances.

B0001Z52RU|4.0|Excellent movie.  Really psychological.  It was deep and I had to have it in my collection.  My personal opinion is that it was a Sixth Sense type of movie.  I highly recommend it!
0525457585|2.0|After being such an ardent fan of the movie. I decided to read the book. The movie and the book are very similar, but different. I think the movie changed the story for the better. I was dissapointed in how quickly this book reads. This author is not a descriptive writer by an means. Compared to the writing style of many of todays writers, he just doesn't measure up in writing ability. The movie was excellent, but the book is just ok. I couldn't visualize all the characters and places in this book, because the author fails to give the lengthy descriptions I am so accustomed to in todays books. New authors never seem to get the credit they desearve and old fabled books like this one get way too much credit. <br />   The only reason why I am giving this book 2 stars is the author is an extrordinarily creative writer and does give a great message to kids, don't give up on your dream. Even this however is a rehash of the old 'Walt Disney' slogan. From all the great things I read about this book from other reviews I had lofty expectations, unfortunately this book fell well short of the quality I was expecting.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I loved this movie as I was growing up and wanted to see if my kids would like it to so I got it!

B000002ITM|2.0|I cant believe there are so many positive ratings given to this sub-par Testament release.  Testament must have taken hints from Metallica and tried to attract a different audience.  This is not a horrible album, but compared to any other Testament album, it is easily their worst.  Only the die-hard Testament fan, or those into commercial metal should pick this up.
B000301YY8|5.0|This CD is MAZING from start to finish! James Blunt is a great singer/songwriter! His song writing is very personal and, yet, comes out very melodic and catchy. He has a very unique voice that just captivates you and pulls you in to each and every song. With A CD filled with ballads' it does not fail to please at any point on any of the CD's 10 songs. There is really no one to compare him to musically. Which in my eyes is a GREAT thing....too many clones in the industry these days. He is a standout and this CD is a MUST HAVE for anyone who is looking for an amazing CD by someone who is not only \\"different\\" but has a well crafted talent.
1594200653|5.0|The two adjectives that come to mind after reading this work are magisterial and comprehensive.  Although I am no expert on the subject, this is probably the most definitive history of postwar Europe to date.  Historian Tony Judt (one of my favorite reviewers for the \\"New York Review of Books\\") was born in London, educated in Paris, and is currently director of the Remarque Institute in New York, an institution dedicated to the better understanding of Europe in America.  In this work, Judt takes us through 60 years of European history, from the wasteland of 1945 to the peaceful and affluent Europe of 2005.<br /><br />After the self-destructive mayhem of the early 20th century, Judt shows how lessons were learned and institutions designed so that the horrors would never be repeated.  He speculates that the European model may yet be the model for other nations or groups of nations to emulate in the 21st century.<br /><br />As Judt rightly points out in his essay on European memory, Europe was able to rebuild economically and politically by forgetting about the immediate past.  There was much to forget.  It was shameful how many people collaborated with the Nazis and how few resisted.  He claims that it took only 1,500 Nazi officials and 6,000 German policemen to control France, a nation of 40 million.  The Netherlands was not much better.  After the war, it would have been even more destructive to seek retribution, even though there was some settling of scores.  The Allies, as well as the Soviets on their side, used former members of the Nazi party to administer the occupied countries, since most of the talented people were part of the Nazi regime.<br /><br />In the immediate aftermath of the war, the period from 1945 to 1949, there was a sense of hopelessness, and it even looked like Europe was doomed as a civilization.  Ironically, it was the beginning of the Cold War that saved Europe.  Western European countries were forced to cooperate with each other on a scale not seen before.  France and Britain originally wanted reparations from Germany, not only because they felt entitled, but they wanted to keep Germany weak.  However, in the face of the gathering Soviet threat, they decided to make West Germany a integral part of Western Europe.<br /><br />In addition, US funding of the Marshall plan and the creation of Nato allowed Western Europeans to work furiously to rebuild their economies.  During this period, they had an economic growth rate that within 10 years made them wealthier than they were before the war.<br /><br />Nato was designed to be a defensive organization.  After the uprisings in Germany in 1953 and Hungary in 1956, it became clear to the Europeans that the US was not going to intervene in Eastern Europe.  This actually created further stability in the West.<br /><br />Judt is very good at showing how the Common Market got started and how it became the European Union of today.  It was a response to the utter destruction of World War II, and it was also a response to the threat of the Soviet Union.  The Social Democratic welfare state was a response to those circumstances.  The Europeans were looking for a social model somewhere between the untrammeled capitalism of America and the command economies of the Soviet Union.  The welfare state in America is a term of obloquy, but in Europe it is considered one of their crowning achievements.<br /><br />In the light of these experiences, it is easy to see why Eurpeans favor negotiation and consensus to power politics and military action.  When Mikhail Gorbachev decided to stop supporting the moribund Communist regimes of Eastern Europe, they unravelled on their own without a shot being fired.  The European wait-and-see attitude served them well.  On the other hand, when Yugoslavia disintegrated, the weakness of their model became very clear.  Europe is a transnational entity, not a superpower.  Nato, being primarily defensive, was unable to stop the genocide on its border.<br /><br />As Judt reminds us, the Europeans forgot the Holocaust in order to rebuild.  It should be added that they need to remember it in order to become a model for the 21st century.cide on its border. <br /> <br />As Judt reminds us, the Europeans forgot the Holocaust in order to rebuild.

B000244FDW|5.0|This was my first introduction to Pride and Prejudice on Masterpiece Theater, and to Jane Austen. For me it was love at first sight. I can remember being glued to my TV every Sunday night and when the series ended I was devastated. My Sunday nights simply were not the same, not to mention the times during the week when the program would come into my mind and I'd think, \\"Only two more days till I get to see the next episode\\". Obsessed? Perhaps, but loving every minute of it. In the end I needed more of Jane Austen and in the years since then I have read all her books and, I believe, seen every film which has been made of them, including the newest version of Pride and Prejudice, the original with Lawrence Olivier and Greer Garson, and the one with Colin Firth. I was VERY happy to recently find this version on Amazon and immediately ordered it. Being my first introduction to Jane Austen, this particular film version is one of my favorites, although I have some feelings about the actor's extreme interpretation of Darcy's prideful manner, I highly recommend this film to everyone.
B000929AJQ|4.0|First off let's get this out of the way. This is not Trents best work. to me that title goes to 1989's Pretty Hate Machine. This is different than any other NIN album. But however With Teeth is still a good album and proves to me Trent is still not a has been or a sell out. Igot it the day it was released. I think we may see better work from Trent he is still in his prime. Trent is a truly talented induvidual. I doubt we will ever agian see another Downward Spiral but we may see something on the level of Broken. Trent has once agian proved he can come back from the dead with great music. I appreciate this album, i don't give it 5 stars because i have to admit there is some filler. i.e You Know Who You Are, and The Collector. but there are far more great songs than lousy songs. The big radio hits are The Hand That Feeds, Only, and the newest one so far which is also the best so far Every Day is Exactly the Same. And I herd With Teeth on the background of some commercial on the radio. My personal favorite song is All the Love in the World. Other great songs are Sunspots, The Line Begins to Blur, and Right Where it Belongs. I think it's afe to say if you want to get into Nine Inch Nails this could be the first album you get from them. Reznor claims there will be another album by NIN later this year which I look forward to, he also says he might release something as Trent Reznor instead of Nine Inch Nails. but in the mean time we can sit back and enjoy his previous work.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Growing up, I loved the early Japanese cartoons like Speed Racer, Star Blazers and Battle for the Planets. I saw this movie first when it was called Warriors of the Wind and was amazed at the style of animation. It was the first full length Japanese anime movie I saw and loved it. Then I found out later that Warriors of the Wind was a poor hack job of a port of the real movie. So I was hoping to see the real version of this amazing movie. When I heard Disney signed a deal with Hayao Miyazaki to bring out all of his films, I was excited. Was alittle disappointed when Nausicaa was not in the first batch of films to be released but I did in enjoy the first set(Castle in the Sky was my favorite from the first batch). The day Nausicaa finally did get released, I bought it the first day and took it home to watch. I was not disappointed. The original film was way better than Warriors of the Wind. Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is still my favorite Japanese Anime film.
B00005JOWF|1.0|Do not see this movie. Don't let your friends see this movie. Don't let your enemies see this movie.<br /><br />Dialogue is the worst I've seen in years. The actors all look waxy due to the \\"Sky Captain\\" effect. And the plot is dum (and can't afford the b).
B000DZIGDU|3.0|Oh, look! it's two hours of half naked buffed up actors yelling at each other, dancing in tents, slapping each other on the chest and laughing and singing and sweating and being annoying. I understand that's the point of this film, but it gets boring. Especially when we're dealing with the ever-hard-to-look at Jake G. I usually gag when Jamie Foxx shows up in movies, but he was the least-bad thing about this one. It's worth a casual look since it is a very well made movie, just don't expect anything other than yelling, singin, dancing men in tents.
1878424319|5.0|Some of the strongest, truest statements are made with the most amazing brevity.  This \\"book\\" of a mere 130 + pages is an example.  It may not be huge, but the statment it makes is.  We are all living in our own man made hell here on earth, think about it, and if you don't agree, sorry, you're just plain ignorant.  I've already re-read the book 3 times, and will continue to do so until I consider myself a warrior for positive change - it starts with each and every one of us to make this a better world to live in - I believe we can do it!
B00001OH7O|4.0|While his most superlative discs were still yet to come, Hunky Dory is the first in an amazing run of essential Bowie 1970's albums (actually there are no really essential albums after the 1970's, but that's getting a tad churlish).  Of course you've heard the hits many times - Changes, Pretty Things, Life On Mars - and many will already own those on compilations.  But I think Bowie is an artist ill-served by hits compilations (similarly Prince), because so much of the power & joy of his music lies in the fact that he crafts albums as individual sonic statements.  If you like that classic Ronson fat Les Paul sound - and let's face it, who doesn't? - you won't go wrong here.
B00001U0E1|3.0|Don't be afraid of the word Shakespeare in the title! This movie is not a junior-high history lesson. It's light, funny, romantic, and a totally irreverent look at Elizabethan England.<br /><br />The idea is that Shakespeare is not some grave, great poet, but a young guy trying to make his way in the theatre. He's written good plays, but nothing truly transcendent. The conceit is that an ill-fated romance--the one great true love of this life--with a beautiful, smart woman is what inspires him to write his first immortal play: Romeo and Juliet.<br /><br />The film never plods. The screenplay is rich with romance, emotion and action. The plot weaves several stories and themes. You can enjoy it as a simple love story with some action and basic suspense about producing a play or you can get much deeper into movie's complex tapestry of ideas and in jokes. But most importantly the film's mood is always light and is never overblown.
B00020HEG6|5.0|I think John Williams is an amazing musician and captivates you with his music.  Listening to this CD made me feel like I was actually watching the movie all over again.  It's fantastic!!!!!
B000E5N62U|4.0|As other reviewers here have noted, it does take time to truly take in everything in any new Dan or Fagen record.  I've yet to  get in deep with this one but my initial reaction is...if you liked the last two Dan albums, you'll dig this one.   It's very much more of the same.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Grey's Anatomy is so addictive that you will not be able to watch just one episode. It is rare to find a television series where ALL of the Actors contribute to the show. The Creator of this show has shown us that there are some shows worth watching, in a day where every television show seems to be a carbon copy of another television show. This show is clearly unique, well executed and superbly written. And you will find yourself making up Mc-isms to everything (must watch the show to find out what Mc-isms are). Truly not suitable for the youngsters in the house but great drama/comedy for the Adults in the family.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|For dog lovers of all ages, Walt Disney's new 50th anniversary LADY AND THE  TRAMP is a must-own paradise.  Restored and remastered beyond its original sound and color by the Disney wizards, this also marks the first time the 1955 CinemaScope movie is available on home video in wide-screen.  So if you have an old VHS copy, give it to charity. <br /> <br />Lady is a home-bound and naive Cocker Spaniel who gets involved with a scruffy, but likeable, brownish-gray mutt named Tramp.  They get in all sorts of mischief with all of the other dogs in a serene turn-of-the-century small town.  The animation and set design details are perfection.  A dark highlight is nasty Aunt Sarah and her \\"We Are Siamese\\" Siamese cats, Si and Am, who get Lady into constant trouble.  Another dark scene that may scare small children occurs with Lady and the Tramp in the dog pound and a parody of Death Row Warners movies.  A comic highlight has a beaver recruited to chew off Lady's face muzzle that Aunt Sarah had put on.  And a romantic highlight has Lady and the Tramp sharing a spaghetti dinner (and kiss) together with \\"Belle Notte\\".  The songs are lovely, never sounded this clear before, and the CinemaScope compositions are exquisite.  They have both been grandly restored and remastered.  Walt would be awed. <br /> <br />Disk one of this two-disk set includes the 76 minute movie in either CinemaScope or full screen \\"pan and scan\\" (your choice), plus a music video of \\"Bella Notte\\".  If you choose, you can also listen to the movie in either French or Spanish.  Disk two runs forever-there is a Games and Activities section for families that I didn't even bother with.  Backstage Disney alone runs a full three hours-unseen deleted sequences; deleted songs or alternate takes; a lengthy documentary on making the movie and another on why is took twenty years to get a workable screenplay; original 1943 storyboards that reveal a very different story with just Lady; and \\"Finding Lady: The Art of the Storyboard.\\" <br /> <br />You will definitely want to add this newly remastered LADY AND THE TRAMP to your DVD library before the studio puts it on moratorium.  Shop around for the best price.  Suggested retail is $30, but you should not have to pay more than $20.  Amazon.com has it for half-price, a bargain $14.95.  Enjoy! <br /> <br />
B00003CXSM|5.0|the movie is great but I received my items in good Condiation.  I will buy products again.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I was able to go see DT at the Pantages Theater on 3/10, INCREDIBLE!!! I didn't think that this album was that great until I heard them play 5 out of 8 songs from the album including Octavatium. I then realized that this album is almost as good as Scenes (my personal favorite album from DT). Too many of you pay attention to lyrics, who cares, for everyone of you that hates the lyrics, there are ten more that either like the lyrics or don't care. I like the \\"Sappy\\" and \\"sweet\\" lyrics, just because you could actually learn a thing or two about life from Petrucci's lyrics. <br /> <br />I'm a 60's and 70's fan, because it's so much better than anything after 85'. DT is probably the best band I have come across so far in my search for some hope of rock returning to its greatness of the 70's. They are heavily influenced by 70's hard rock so it's great to listen to them.  <br /> <br />Full Circle is a cool song cause of all the references, but then they continue to blow you away all the way to the end. I'm listening to it right now :) <br /> <br />I Walk Beside You is also cool because it's their first good song that uses the under-5 minute format, and they still rock. <br /> <br />These Walls is a great song too. I just liked looking for all the references to the #8 within the album booklet. <br /> <br />Hopefully DT will continue to get better and then they will finally get the respect they deserve. 'Cause, they are nothing like the horrible bands today that scream and yell over horrid guitar parts. Oh, Myung is just unbelieveable. I would compare him to Entwhistle of the Who, he is just that good. <br /> <br />I recommend this album and I suggest you pick up some of their other albums like, Awake, Images and Words, A Change of Seasons, and Scenes From a Memory. <br /> <br />Let it Be!
0898705525|5.0|Once I had the good fortune to be in a discussion group for this book. Like most book reading groups, most of the members didn't read the book, skimming or glancing at it, barely cracking the cover. However, this book was different. It exercised a spell even on those who didn't read it. Why? Because Chesterton is so given to aphorisms that even if you don't follow his logic (or illogic some might contend) or don't agree with his arguments (or random trains of thought in another view), you still might be caught by some pithy epigram or turn of phrase.<br /><br />I heartily throw in my lot with all those who think this is GKC's best non-fiction book, but I'd rather tackle the opposite concern of the problems it poses for the casual reader. One reason is that Chesterton often resorts to metonymy as a kind of shorthand, which means he uses a piece to represent a whole. In a bad writer, this amounts to stereotyping (of which Chesterton has been accused). In a good writer it nevertheless anchors the work to a time and locality.<br /><br />In Chesterton, it means you need to either be an anglophile or have a good grip of things British. You don't know that gaol is a jail or Pimlico slang for prison. Bedlam represents a madhouse. Taking this idea to extremes, he often uses a hot button word to represent an idea (and nearly always an idea opposite to that commonly held). Anybody else would accompany such passing thoughts with reams of footnotes and disclaimers, but Chesterton eschewed both, and instead goes for the naked effect.<br /><br />The example that comes to mind is that he seems to be arguing in favor of the Inquisition, when in fact he's making some other point altogether. For most readers that conjures the horrors of Torquemada as lampooned in Mel Brook's movie History of the World Part One. GKC however, is referring not to the Spanish excesses, but to the gentler, kinder version on the continent which at its inception not only had no truck with torture but in fact forbade it.<br /><br />As most readers are aware, Chesterton was Anglican (Church of England) when he wrote this book, although his thinking is arguably Anglo-Catholic. It's also largely a book of thinking out loud rather than a settled, finished statement. Some chapters therefore read easier than others, The Ethics of Elfland and The Flag of the World being the premier examples.<br /><br />So many readers are so happy to discover Chesterton that he is quoted everywhere from Rolling Stone to Looney Tunes (In a Chuck Jones Foghorn Leghorn cartoon the chickenhawk's pop is named G.K.Chickenhawk). I think that's a good thing because these days many people are not readers, preferring video games or some other entertainment, and of those who are, many don't \\"get\\" Chesterton. While this may prevent a full scale Chesterton revival, it opens doors for those who, like Phillip Yancey and Dale Ahlquist bring him up every chance they get, and gives those of us taken by his ideas or at least a few epigrams a chance to scatter the largesse.n fact forbade it. <br /> <br />As most readers are aware, Chesterton was Anglican (Church of England) when he wrote this book, although his thinking is arguably Anglo-Catholic.

B000002MNL|5.0|This is Morrissey's greatest solo album.  Melancholy and witty, as usual, with music that is more haunting than his prior solo albums.  This is mature Moz, and compares favorably with his Smith's days, although nothing nothing can ever replicate his collaboration with Marr.    Of course I'm preaching to the choir if you're a Morrissey fan.  But if you're a new fan, buy this album immediately.  There's no debate, no debate, no debate.
0380789019|5.0|One of the prime qualities of a genius writer is that he actually *takes* you there. From the first few pages of Neverwhere, Gaiman practically teleports you into London Below: you begin to see the sights and the figures, hear the voices and smell the odors on the underlife of London. More than this, you hear, see, and smell it through the eyes, ears and nose of poor old Richard Mayhew, the anti-hero protagonist of this tale. You actually feel the anxiety (hysteria, more like it) of realizing that you have been yanked out of your life and dropped into a strange new world, where you are suddenly an absolute beginner again. And you just can't stop reading it.<br /><br />Neverwhere was the first Gaiman non-graphic work which I read, after totally enjoying the Sandman series as well as some of his magnificent graphics works such as Signal To Noise (with Dave McKean). I have to say I was hesitant to buy it at first, in fear that I might be disappointed, as if some of the magic might go away when the work is reduced to pure text. I couldn't be more mistaken. The magic is there, and much more of it.
1932100385|5.0|Why do Americans spend more money on dieting, nutritional supplements, and pharmaceutical drugs than other societies and still have the highest rates of obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer?  Is it just bad luck and genetics?  Prior to reading the China Study, I have had some assumptions about diet and related maladies - especially the \\"high protein\\" craze (if carbohydrates cause obesity, how come other cultures that consume large amounts are not all over weight?)- but had not come across a reliable, scientific look at the associations.   <br /> <br />The China Study investigates the relationship of the foods we eat and the diseases that afflict us.  It not only relies on the actual \\"China Study\\", but numerous other studies and articles from peer reviewed sources.  The first 2/3 of the book concentrate on the actual studies and the diseases discussed (diseases of affluence).  This portion is very informing, but is not the most exciting reading and may loose some readers looking for a more emotional, brief explanation (200 pages is pretty brief, though, to discuss the diseases, related studies, and dietary correlations).  The latter 1/3 of the book focuses on applicable diets and the politics/business of the medical/food industry.  The dietary part is brief and not specific on exactly what you should eat, how much, etc., but gives a readable explanation.  The last section, \\"Why Haven't You Heard This Before?\\", is very interesting and contains Dr. Campbell's own as well as other non-conventional doctors' experiences with the status-quo medical systems.  (An interesting note:  The drug company AstraZeneca has just released a study showing their drug, Crestor, can reduce plaque in arteries, and is being heralded as the first \\"pill [that] has ever reversed the years of damage that lead to heart attacks.\\" (Bloomberg.com) Look on page 129-130 of the China Study and see the results of Dr. Ornish's study (from 1990!) on dietary changes and reversal of blockages.  Asa result of the study, AstraZeneca's stock rose to its highest level since June 2002.) <br /> <br />This is an excellent book and makes valid argumentation for a plant based diet.  It should not be the end all investigation, though, and I will be interested to look for conflicting materials and other studies of similar aspects.  <br /> <br />Be forewarned:  you will be faced with a dietary dilemma after reading the China Study. <br />

0689835604|4.0|My 17 month old daughter loves books.  I recently bought her a new selection and this was one of them.  It keeps her busy and she can study the different pages and recognize body parts such as hands, teeth, etc.  She also likes to play peek-a-boo with the baby at the end. <br /> <br />My only complaint is that I've had the book for less than a month and with repeated readings a few pieces tore out and I had to tape them back in.  I know that is a possibility with little hands and lift-the-flap type of books but I thought this was awful soon.  My daughter loves her books and doesn't throw them around or rip or tear at them.
B000007T1M|5.0|Although I like all of their albums, I think that System of a Down's old stuff is better than their new stuff even though the latter is still awesome. Reasons are that their old stuff is more political with stronger messages and more emotion. Their old stuff is also heavier and the guitars sound more clear. Serj's voice is better in the past because like the guitars it sounded more clear. Also there are less weird filler tracks. Their self-titled debut could be my favourite album along with Toxicity. It had catchy Armenian influenced riffs and wasn't too radio friendly like Toxicity. All System of a Down albums share one problem, they're too short. Toxicty was their longest album at 44 minutes which isn't too long. This album is 40 minutes long but it's still very impressive and we didn't even talk about the songs yet:<br /><br />Suite-Pee: 4/5 Begins with an odd riff then explodes immediatly. A great start to the album although not as good as Prison Song from Toxicity. The most controversial language on the album.<br /><br />Know: 5/5 Now here's an awesome song! Serj's voice has lots of melody and does his trademark growl in the chorus. Also has Daron Malakian's trademark stop-start riff which on this album is in almost all the songs!<br /><br />Sugar: 5/5 Ahhh Sugar... definately the catchiest song on the album! It's also the most popular song and had an amazing and funny video as well. Daron says the song title in a funny way and has Shavo Odajin's bass audible in the chorus!<br /><br />Suggestions: 5/5 Begins with an acoustic guitar and then begins. Not the heaviest on the album but still has great moments with some of the best lyrics here.<br /><br />Spiders: 5/5 Beautiful... just beautiful! Another huge hit from the album and one of the three beautiful songs on the album. It's about the problem with remote viewing and how it prevents your dreams and inner thoughts from being sacred. Another amazing video as well (all of SOAD's videos are amazing).<br /><br />Ddevil: 3/5 About controlling your brain and to prevent doing stupid things. Don't really care much about this song. Shortest song on the album and I'm not so found of short songs.<br /><br />Soil: 5/5 Very catchy and even vulgar song. Serj's multi-octave voice really shines here just like it did on Suggestions. If you have young kids then switch this song as just like Suite-Pee it has a lot of swearing.<br /><br />War?: 5/5 Another hit off of this album and yet another high-quality video! About our excuses for world-domination and how we always fight the \\"heathans\\". Great break-out moments and one of the most intense songs on this album!<br /><br />Mind: 5/5 Get ready people as this is not only the longest song on the album but the longest SOAD song of all time (6:16)!!! It's about the CIA using a controversial method known as mind-control. This is another beautiful song which starts off very slow, then it stops, then it explodes through the rest of the song, and finally ends nice and calm again. Awesome!!!<br /><br />Peephole: 4/5 This obscure song is about a controversial study that states marijuana to be safer than alcohal and tobacco. Sounds like a circus song and is weird but still cool!<br /><br />CUBert: 3/5 This is a confusing song. It starts off with Daron's signature stop-start riffs. This song is too short and confusing though.<br /><br />Darts: 4/5 About the confusion of God existence. The ending of this song kind of remainds me of a Korn song with the somewhat tortured vocals. A good song with a cool chorus.<br /><br />P.L.U.C.K.: 5/5 The last beautiful song on the album. What's strange is that on every other SOAD album the ending tracks are ballads that are only mildly heavy. This song could be the heaviest on the album yet it has the strongest message out of all the songs, a dedication to the victims of the 1915 Armenian Genocide. It slows down near the end though. Very very awesome song that has great drum rolls and Daron's riffs never sounded better!<br /><br />So you should definately buy this album! Although I love and own all of their albums, System of a Down's older stuff is better!and own all of their albums, System of a Down's older stuff is better!
0060723513|1.0|I thought this book was a little far out so I checked the author out on the internet and found that she had made up the entire story. Supposedly this was a true story. The writing is poor and the story is quite unplausible.
B000062YAZ|5.0|WARNING: The following album contains lyrics releating to Satanism, necrophiliacs, and the holocaust. If you have weak nerves and are a wimp (like \\"I Love Fall Out Boy\\") then avoid this album!!!<br /><br />Okay enough of that crap, now let's get to the damn review! This was Slayer's finest hour, produced by the great Rick Rubin and released in the year of thrash, 1986! 1986 was the year that Metallica's Master of Puppets, Megadeth's Peace Sells... But Who's Buying, and Slayer's Reign in Blood! Wow what a year! This album is short but very very sweet.<br /><br />Kerry King is the guitarist that made me play guitar. His bloody fast riffs and menacing look can only be competed by James Hetfield and Dave Mustaine. Slayer's second guitarist Jeff Hanneman is no slouch either, he just doesn't have as much solos as King. Dave Lombardo is such a superb drummer that he will make the mediocre as hell drums of Simple Plan's Chuck Comeau cry with his double-bass and his loud pounds! Tom Araya is a great vocalist and bassist. He doesn't really \\"sing\\" he kind of does a chant thing but it fits the anger of this album. His bass work is very audible and he's probably along with Cliff Burton and Peter Steele my favourite bassist.<br /><br />The songs on this album are brief (except Angel of Death and Raining Blood) but are very energetic and convey that energy only stopping to make brief breathers on Jesus Saves, Criminally Insane, and Raining Blood. My favourite songs are Angel of Death, Jesus Saves, and Raining Blood. The songs I like the least are Piece By Piece and Postmortem because they don't have any solos but are still great. Raining Blood was the song that got me into Slayer!<br /><br />1986 was the year of Thrash Metal and Reign in Blood is one of the greatest metal albums of all time! It's not for the easily offended and the die-hard Chrisitan (*cough* Mr. Noel Kelly). Everyone else should get off their asses and buy this album! IT'LL SURELY RAISE YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE!!!
B00004RF8J|5.0|This is a great movie to watch when you just want to laugh!  No thinking required!
B000002MFQ|3.0|How do you rate this?  Do you rate it on its own merits, as a rehash, or one of many Oldfield outputs to milk every last penny out of the name Tubular Bells?    FIRST, LET'S LOOK AT THIS ON ITS OWN, AS IF THERE WERE NO OTHER VERSIONS OF TUBULAR BELLS:    I give it 3 stars.  Released in 1992, this is a nice, mostly instrumental CD.  It is 58 minutes long and has very good sound.    The first 25 minutes are a great flowing suite of progressive rock music.  It kind of reminds of Focus in how well the music flows from one section to the next.      Things start to go downhill after the first 25 minutes.  It first goes into The Bells, which has a nice rhythm and theme, but is silly and goes on too long at 8 minutes.  There is a great bassline, while an announcer calls out the names of different instruments that play a riff.    From there, things just fall apart.  The next 17 minutes are some New Age Scottish/Irish influenced folk music. It is a lot like Oldfield's second album Hergest Ridge. It is just boring and goes on too long.  This is followed by the really wierd Altered States, that consists of some wierd vocals that sound like someone is trying to clear his throat, plus a mommy singing and a girl asking questions.    Things get back on track with the nice accoustic guitar and vocals number, Maya Gold, and then finishes off with a little Blue Grass number.    NOW LET'S COMPARE THIS TO THE ORIGINAL TUBULAR BELLS:    I give this version to 2 stars when I compare it to the original.      Although the original Tubular Bells was a ground breaking album that helped increase the popularity of Progressive Rock, it was only a 4 star album.      There were some great passages in the original Tubular Bells, such as the theme that was used in the movie, The Excorcist (which in turn made Tubular Bells a smash hit).  But, it does have some minor excesses and pretentiousness that mar many progressive/art rock works, such as the silly part where there is an announcer that calls outeach instrument as it does a solo and the vocals that sound like someone trying to clear his throat.    Tubular Bells 2 is an extended, updated version of the original.  The first 25 minutes are as good and might even be better than the original.  There are some interesting vocals and instruments in this new version.    But, after The Bells, Tubular Bells 2 really falls apart.  It no longer flows like the original.  What is sounds like is one of those CD's that had a bunch of crappy bonus material tacked on to the end.  The type of bonus material that should have stayed on the cutting room floor.    I don't think the first part of Tubular Bells 2 is different enough from the original to recommend buying it.  And the second part is a disaster.    NOW LET'S LOOK AT IT COMPARED TO ALL THE VERSIONS OF TUBULAR BELLS.    I give it 1 star.    There are at least 7 versions of Tubular Bells:  The original  The original live version  The original with orchestra  Tubular Bells 2  Tubular Bells 2 live  Tubular Bells 3  Tubular Bells 2003    Just how many ways can you milk this beast?  Especially when it was just merely a good piece of music.  If Oldfield is going to keep remaking this, he shouldn't be just doing slight variations on a theme.  He should go for one really great version.   And get rid of the master of ceremonies and clearing of the throat.
B00006F1IJ|5.0|I heard a song or two on the radio in my car one day and I just had to find out who these guys were. I called the radio station to find out. Jamaica Heartbeat and Shoot the Loop were the songs. I was hooked! This CD in particular is one that I NEVER get tired of listening to. Every song is enjoyable and relaxing. The entire CD takes me to a variety of far away places. I would absolutely love to see them in concert. A very talented group of guys!

B00000DHTF|5.0|Tracks proves one thing: Bruce Springsteen can write a bad song or two. But for fans of the Boss finding a rare Bruce blunder can be just as interesting and revealing as finding a rare Bruce gem. And Tracks is loaded with gems. Most of the 65 songs are as strong or stronger than the songs on the albums they were cut from. Tracks is a must for true Bruce fans.
1594200440|5.0|This book turned out to be a sleeping giant for us.  I chose a few copies for our \\"whimsy pile\\" and before I knew it we had been innundated with requests from thousands of our book distributors.    I think the strange title may dissuade the average reader, so for us its popularity is entirely due to word of mouth.    Several thousand orders later, this has been a runaway success.    The spotlight review gives you a taste of the book, but, like the laughter it generates, it works best when you experience it yourself.     The book is much more than another humorous novel, it has a great poignancy.  The relationship between the middle aged daughgter and the elderly father makes it a must read just for this. Her discovery that her father is so much more than....well read it and you will understand.    Not recommended for any readers with painful sutures/stitches or cracked ribs.

B00008BXJ6|4.0|Not my favorite AC/DC album of the Bon Scott era but a classic nonetheless (and their first American release). Get it for two songs, no not T.N.T. and High Voltage, everyone knows those, but for It's A Long Way to the Top and Live Wire. If you already have this CD and are wondering if the digitally remastered version with booklet is worth the money, hell yes! The bass on Live Wire cranked up will shake every picture off your wall.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|AWESOME MOVIE!  I really enjoyed the flick.  Though, I'd have to say that this movie is definitely for those who have some understanding/interest in the supernatural. <br /> <br />The devil was played beautifully...
B00008BXJG|5.0|The last album of the too-short Bon Scott era. Solid from start to finish. Mutt Lange's first production tightened up the band's sound but almost, I say almost, made the boys a bit too Top Fortyish. Polished and not as raw as the superior Let There Be Rock. A classic nonetheless. And yes, this digitally remastered version is worth the extra few bucks.

B00097A5HW|4.0|This, Shakira's latest Spanish-language album, is the first of two parts (the second being its English counterpart, \\"Oral Fixation Volume 2\\").  The title (and cover) allude to the possibility of Ms. Shaki's wish to have little ones of her own, in the future.  The songs cover the range of emotions (predominantly those of love), and the beats and rhythms range from full throttle rock n' roll (\\"Escondite Ingles\\"), to sultry ballad (\\"Obtener Un Si\\").  Of course, one of the most popular tracks featured on this album is \\"La Tortura\\" (featuring the Spanish pop artist, Alejandro Sanz).  There is no doubt about it, that this song is hot stuff. It combines the intoxicating Middle Eastern-inspired beats, where Shakira channels her beautiful Lebanese heritage (on her father's side), with percussive, rock elements.<br /><br />The strength of this album rides on Shakira's tremendous vocal prowess, its range of song styles and musical inspirations.  An example of how mainstream music has shaped Shaki's style is heard in \\"La Pared,\\" whose hook is directly lifted from \\"Clocks,\\" by the rock group Coldplay.  For the most part, this is a very strong album (though, my vote is for Donde Estan Los Ladrones, when we talk about the strongest albums of Shakira's career.  That album is simply in a class by itself.)<br /><br />Check it out!  You will fall under Shakira's spell (not unlike many other music lovers out there)!
B000EHRVP6|1.0|The movie is way overrated. The story is good, but movie was not. There were way too many sex scenes and made up a majority of the movie. It wasn't as gory as advertised. I thought the remake of The Hills Have Eyes was much better.

B000E6UK5K|4.0|I really like this new cd from DG.  It's not PF but neither were the last two PF albums.  I haven't really been into PF since Roger Waters left.  I liked some of Momentary and could really care less about the Division Bell cd.  I didn't even go see them in concert for either of those albums. <br /> <br />In my opinion PF should have renamed after Syd left.  Totally different stuff you know? <br /> <br />So lets take this new record by DG under review...I wasn't expecting very much at all from this.  In fact I wasn't even sure why I bought it.  Probably because 99% of the music out there today is pure crap.  So I took a chance...I'm glad I did. <br />I love the instrumental tracks and really love Take a Breathe. <br /> <br />Blah, Blah, Blah...I liked it and I'm very hard to please.

Before you scoff, try watching a couple of seasons. And sorry, I tried to like Buffy, but...
B000E6UK5K|4.0|David Gilmour, who is best-known for being the lead singer and guitarist for the legendary Pink Floyd, just released his new solo album, On An Island, this past March.  And let me say, you'll truly feel like you're on an island with this album of his, swept away by the musical genius of Mr. Gilmour. <br /> Mr. Gilmour, who just turned 60 this past month, has been rather inactive musically with the exception of his studio-work since 1994's release of Pink Floyd's The Division Bell.  His solo efforts have been few and sparse and only include his self-titled debut in 1978 and another record, About Face, in 1983.  But this makes this record all the better and it's the next best thing to Pink Floyd records. <br /> The album begins with the atmospheric instrumental, Castellorizon, which features a full stringed-orchestra backing Gilmour's very emotional guitar soloing.  Following it is the title track, a beautiful piece and personal favorite which features Graham Nash and David Crosby on back-up vocals.  Next is the Blue, another relaxing and melodic track.  The laid-back feel is broken however by the next track, Take A Breath, a very catchy and dark rocker which is highly reminiscent of several Pink Floyd songs.  Following it, Red Sky At Night is Mr. Gilmour's debut on the saxophone.  This Heaven, a quirky rocker precedes this and leads into Then I Close My Eyes, a song which may make you close your eyes...  Smile is an emotional acoustic piece, A Pocketful of Stones is a string-based ballad, and Where We Start is a great way to end the album. <br /> Overall, this album isn't for everybody because of the mellowness and numerous ballads.  However, my advice is to not to judge this album based on this-instead, let it grow on you so that you can take in the whole image that Mr. Gilmour is trying to convey through his music.  This is highly recommended material-4 out of 5 stars.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|One of the Best movies I have seen in a long time.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|And I really liked the movie. The cover of \\"king of the road\\" alone is worth the price.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|In the past Enya albums, I have come to expect a certain feel to the music.  This one, however, didn't seem to fit that mold.  That, by no means, indicates that this is a bad album because it is good.  It just doesn't have the same feel. <br /> <br />The first song, Less Than a Pearl, has a feel from an elder time.  It has the feel of ritual to it.  It's an interesting sound, but not the easy listening I am accustomed to from Enya.  The second song, the title song Amarantine, does have the flow of past albums.  Anyone can listen and appreciate the beauty of her voice. <br /> <br />The next two songs, It's in the Rain and If I Could be Where You Are, are both ethereal songs of longing for a faraway love.  Enjoying these songs, you can't but feel her sense of tender sorrow and she aches for her departed love.  Pure Enya. <br /> <br />The River Sings and Long Long Journey are good songs, but they puzzle me.  I have taken to viewing each Enya album as a beautiful mosaic.  These two songs don't seem to fit as they draw attention to themselves.  They are not bad songs, but they are different. <br /> <br />The remaining songs are simply poetry.  They are songs that you can either consciously listen to them or just let them seep into your subconscious while you do something else.  Either way, the music will move you. <br /> <br />Although this album doesn't quite feel like the others, this is a good album.  I would recommend giving this a listen. <br />
0393327655|3.0|I have to agree that many of the hurts of humans are related  or proveked by religion. But, I think that the word religion is no longer and should no longer relate to God, that is because religion has become an individual's idea or opinion of who God is. I think , no you think, and then a religion is created. One's opinion of God doesn't mean that that is the character of God. God is God and that's it...Thus yes...religion is a great dangeour for a society and it has been. But don't blame God...that's all..
B00006LLLN|4.0|Most live albums I listen to tend to be rock, and they tend to sound like a live performance.  There is no proverbial safety net, so the singers may not quite hit the notes, and the guitars sometimes have a little too much feedback.  Regardless, the crowds love it. <br /> <br />Given that, I expected to hear much the same from Alison Krauss and Union Station.  Wow!  The musicianship of these people is fabulous.  The playing is flawless.  The crowds love it, but the crowd does seem more polite, but I am sure the audience is just in awe of the quality. <br /> <br />This two-disc set has a lot of the songs from New Favorite, but it has a few others.  I was surprised to hear the live version of \\"I am a Man of Constant Sorrow\\" from Oh Brother, Where Are Thou.  The recording is in Louisville, Kentucky, so when the name of the state comes up in the song, the crowd lets out a big roar.  Great songs with great rapport with the audience. <br /> <br />The songs range from instrumental to vocal.  \\"Choctaw Hayride\\" is an instrumental romp that will get your toe tapping, and \\"Down to the River to Pray\\" will have you merely enjoying the voices a cappella.  Alison sings most of the leads while Dan and Ron also lend their voices to lead on a few songs. <br /> <br />This is a refreshing live album, and after hearing it, I would definitely want to hear them in concert. <br /> <br />
B00005V9QJ|5.0|Superb. I usually avoid live albums, but after hearing 'Somebody Already Broke My Heart' on the car satellite radio, I knew I had to order this album right away.  Sade's dreamy voice floating over solid jazz backups and the group's synergy with the audience create a completely electrifying listening experience.   Extended, updated versions of 'No Ordinary Love' and 'Is It A Crime' plus the haunting 'Cherish The Day' make this comeback album a total winner.  You're going to want to own the concert DVD as well, which contains additional tracks, plus the vision of Sade herself dancing to 'Paradise.'  CD or DVD, both experiences are worth owning and sharing with friends.  Oh, and yes: listen for the thunderstorm just before the band launches into 'Sweetest Taboo' --- like all the music on this album, a 'quiet storm.'
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This cancelled tv series (that I didn't see on tv) is fantastic. If you're a Star Wars/Star Trek fan you will love this as well as the movie, \\"Serenity.\\" Capt. Tightpants (Malcomb Reynolds) surely gives Han Solo/Capt. Kirk a run for the money in sex appeal and guts. I only wish for MORE MORE MORE.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|This soundtrack is quite simply one of the best soundtracks I have ever listed to.  \\"A Love That Will Never Grow Old\\" by Emmylou Harris and \\"He Was A Friend of Mine\\" by Willie Nelson are incredibly moving songs that complement the film wonderfully.  Rufus Wainwright is one of my favorite artists and does not disappoint with his two songs.  My favorite part of this soundtrack, however, are the short, melodious instrumental scores between the main songs.  This soundtrack is unforgettable, poignant and evocative of the heart-wrenching story told in the movie.  If you liked the movie, you will listen to this CD often!
B00004R9A4|4.0|\\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\" is a delightful kid's movie for children aged 4 and older. David Tomlinson (of Mary Poppins fame) and Angela Lansbury are well-cast as proprietor of a [bogus-or so he thinks] mail order college of witchcraft, and his surprisingly adept student, respectively. By modern standards, the movie is a bit over-long; my children are accustomed to 75-90 min films and \\"B&B\\" is over two hrs in length. Also, very young children will need to be provided with some historical perspective. Even so, you will not go wrong with this movie.

630463949X|5.0|This DVD is great like most reviews have said. Just couple of other minor points: <br /> <br />The DVD has subtitle, i.e. lyrics, as they sang that you can turn on. <br /> <br />The DVD starts playing by itself. No umpteen minutes wait for a menu to appear before you can select play.
B00005MAM2|1.0|I have heard many people say that they like the anime more than the manga because the manga has a confusing ending, but after seeing both the anime and the manga... Well, I have to say that I like the manga better. Sure, the manga did have a confusing ending, but the ending to the Akira movie is even more confusing to me!   Even though both the anime movie and the manga both have confusing endings, I have to say that I prefer the manga because it takes you so much further into the story.   I dont think the movie is as good as the manga, but what more can you expect? They tried to cram 6 volumes of story into a movie that's less than 3 hours long.   Anyway, after seeing this movie and reading the manga, it is my oppinion that it's just not as entertaining.   I would have absolutely loved this movie if they had've based it completely on the book, but since I read the manga first... Well, the story just seems way too rushed when compared to the manga.    Pros: The art work of this movie is very impressive, all of the scenes in this movie were drawn very well, and the action will keep you on the edge of your seat.    Cons: Although some people love the music in this movie, I happen to find it terribly repetitive and highly annoying!  Like many of Otomo's other movies, this movie feels really long while you're watching it.  Even though this movie is under 3 hours long, you'll feel like you've been watching it all day until it comes to the point that you're hoping and waiting for the movie to end!  SPOILER WARNING!!! (IF YOU HAVENT YET SEEN THE MOVIE DO NOT READ BEYOND THIS POINT!)  Towards the end of the movie, Tetsuo discovers that Akira, the one that he's been searching for, is dead. When I saw that part in the movie, right after hearing the Colonal say, \\"Akira's been dead for years\\" I actually said outloud, \\"What the hell?!\\"   Akira wasn't dead in the manga, and I think that it's really stupid that he died in the movie. Also, at the end of the movie, Akira appears asa sweet lil boy, but in the manga he was one sick twisted little freak! I just dont get why they changed it so much!    If you've already seen the movie then I highly recomend buying the manga! You will be amazed how much further the story goes.    If you've already read the manga and want to see the movie then I recomend that you either rent it or buy the much cheaper VHS before making the decision to buy this DVD.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|I bought this series not really expecting to like it. Now, after watching every show it is my favorite Star Trek, and I think whoever made the decision to end it should be smacked, then fired, then smacked again. (Security!)<br /><br />I still do not like Scott Bakula as the Captain. I kept waiting for that other dude to show up and tell him he had to wear a dress to fix the time continium (Quantum Leap).<br /><br />I realize that playing a captain that is supposed have noone elses experiences to have learned from has got to be tough. But its like Scott was trying to hard.<br /><br />Connor Trinneer could have been likeable as a character if it weren't for his country accent. That kept pulling me out of the story. I am supposed to believe that they still have red necks in that year??? ... and that he is an engineer on a starship?? Who came up with that character??<br /><br />Jolene Blalock - T'Pol OH MY @#%$!!! That woman is HOT!!!Georgous!!! FINE!!! She played T'Pol very well. Even before we knew of T'Pol's affliction/addiction she seemed tired, not herself. When we find out about her little problem it all makes sense. And she is HOT! Someone please tell her to put out an exercise video. How did she get her stomach to look so tight? And she is HOT!<br /><br />Linda Park was an interesting part of the crew as Hoshi. She played her well I thought, and brought an angle to the show that I didn't expect. Building the first data base that future translaters would build on is just plain cool. She was very sexy in the last few shows. I think she could have been allowed to be a little cuter during the whole series, but she definately made up for it at the end.<br /><br />  Reguardless of what some of the other reviews say the storys were very well written if you see the whole series. Each story built on top of the last, and you found out that the little missions that they did were part of a bigger concern that was coming.<br /><br />  I was kinda sad when I got to the last show. These guys didnt get a real chance. If Deep Space 9 got seven seasons, these guys should have gotten 10. I mean DS9 is STUCK in one place. How stupid a concept that is. Enterprise was doing what Star Trek is famous for. Going out there and meeting new races, dealing with problems and situations that no one has come against before and over coming them. That is the essence of Star Trek. That is what Enterprise did VERY well.<br /><br />  Toward the end it seems that they are trying desperately to save their show. Sexier outfits etc. What ruined this show like all good Sci-Fi shows is IGNORANT programming directors who slot the shows in horrible spots, then move them, then move them again. All the while not advertising them. I kid you not, I never knew this show existed until I saw and bought the boxed set! Does that tell you what a horrible job they do advertising Sci-Fi shows?<br /><br />  If I ran the Sci-Fi channel I would get rid of all the black and white twilight zones and junk, and put some REAL shows on, like this one, BSG, Farscape, etc.<br /><br />  I think all Sci-Fi fans somewhere deep inside think that by watching/reading Sci-Fi in some way we will be better prepared for the future and the adventure that will come. If we didn't have a little imagination, we wouldn't enjoy Sci-Fi. Enterprise came up against some new situations. I will have to use some of those tricks should I ever find myself face to face with an emotional half dressed Vulcan girl. (Just incase).<br /><br />In short.<br /><br />1. Battlestar Galactica<br /><br />2. Star Trek Enterprise series. Season 1 - 4.<br /><br />** Someone PLEASE bring this series back **got to the last show. These guys didnt get a real chance.

B00004U45G|4.0|Review no.115. I've been wanting to get a copy of this 2-CD release for awhile now. Simply too many new and upcoming titles out there at any given time to get like everything you believe might look good,right? Total of twenty songs here for your listening enjoyment. Many Zeppelin classics like, \\"Custard Pie\\", \\"Sick Again\\", \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\", \\"Ten Years Gone\\", \\"Your Time Is Gonna Come\\", the jamming \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\", \\"You Shook Me\\",\\"Out Of The Titles\\" (you don't that one everyday)and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\". Way to go! No complaints there. Black Crowes have never been one of my favorites anyway, but THIS I like. Sure, it's rekindling the old school Zep scene. But, who cares? It's really nice. Only Black Crowes cut I noticed right off the bat was \\"Shake Your Money Maker\\". Sort of relieved they didn't include \\"Black Dog\\" or \\"Rock & Roll\\". Both are good tunes, it's just I'm sort of burned out on them at the moment. Vocalist Chris Robinson did a decent job of 'filling in' for Robert Plant, I thought. A should-have for most Zeppelin fans.
B0009I7NNA|1.0|I went from liking this band to totally hating them.  I dont know how a band can can from an average record to this garbage.  These guys dress like a bunch of **gs, and think they are cool.  The only people who like them now are the stupid people who tatooed the band logo on to their body somewhere, so they have to like them, it's like a deal with the devil.  \\"While agreeing to tatoo this band onto your body for eternity, you have to sware to love this band and it's music for their career, no matter how bad it is.\\"   <br /> <br />Dont buy this record!!  If you really must hear it, illegally download it.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|Easy going, melodic music.  Touches of old Jefferson Airplane, Grateful Dead, Bob Dylan and Eagles.  It is with the Cardinals that Ryan Adams is at his best in my opinion.  2 CD's for 12 bucks is a bargain.  This set is worth much more!
B000000H5K|5.0|This album got me into these guys..I always like refreshing change in metal, and I loved how the band brought in their south american heritage in this music and combined it with thrash metal effectively like in the song \\"Ambush\\", \\"Itsari\\" <br /> <br />It's too bad that Max left....Soulfly is alright, but Sepultura was so much better...Max, get back together with the rest of your band, bury the hatchet and reborn one of the best metal acts in years. <br /> <br />the last great album by these guys, before max left, is \\"Under A Pale Grey Sky\\" A two CD, live recording of them playing in London.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|All 4 of the TV movies in one place, Limited extras but if you are a Tremors fan its great fun.
B00006FDCJ|3.0|This must be rated high by viewers because of it's cast; certainly not as a result of it's quality as a movie.  <br /> <br />Midway through this film I forgot what it was all about then at 1h  5 mins I then remembered that the whore was cut up and her friends set a bounty on the cowboys who did the deed. <br /> <br />It was then I  realised how stupid it all was...the men cut up the whore ...so what !!( remember this is 1880 and women especially whores are there for the taking) and who in their right mind would kill for these unarmed whores when they can kill the whores and take the money. <br /> <br />I completely forgot about the guys who cut up the prostitute;infact I felt no hatred for them as I normally would for a movie villian.  <br /> <br />In this town of big whisly the real villian seems to be within.
0790729369|4.0|well well..the scene at the stop lights when meryl had her hand on the door handle was a classic...geez you guys have to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> <br />Meryl at her best Clint in a fine role. <br /> <br /> <br />I watch mostly unknown movies and seldom see films with major stars in the cast but this one actually has two top flight names in the casting list and I actually rate this film highly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Set in the 1960's in a quiet reserved town a lonely married woman finds love when a stranger comes to town; while her family  is away for 4 days these two strangers fall in love. <br /> <br /> <br />I recommend this. <br />
B00005YU1O|5.0|I'll tell you one thing first up. <br /> <br /> <br />If you are an idiot or if more than 2 people call you an idiot today or if you consider yourself to be an idiot dont even try to understand this film. <br /> <br /> <br />This is a thinking person's film and it takes a lot of patience to really understand the depth of thought necessary to understand a film of this type.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|To put it as plainly as I can ......  <br /> <br />This is EXQUISITE and well worth the 12-year wait! <br /> <br />Cheers, David!  Job well done!!
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Historically accurate naval war movie that offers insight into superior managerial leadership and personal relationships. Strong acting, writing and direction and a good plot. <br /> <br />The extra disk shows fascinating details of how the movie is made using both computer animation and live footage to create truly realistic scenes.  <br /> <br />For a fan of this genre it is well worth the price.
B000DZIGDU|3.0|... I found myself increasingly annoyed in the commentary with William Broyles.  All wars are different, but there's an old saying: each army is fully prepared to fight the previous war.  Whether the French in World War II or old Vietnam cadres commenting in the face of either Gulf War.  Broyles seems to assume the worst of soldiers and command and totally misses the generation differences between the Boomers and Gen-Xers--yet has previous made sweeping universal conclusions on military conduct and presents them as \\"compassionate\\" fact. <br /> <br />Listening to the Vietnam-in-Iraq wishy-washy commentary in this movie only serves to make one wonder how it affected the screenplay and thus the structure of the movie. <br /> <br />A flawed movie, which could have easily been another Apocalypse Now or Platoon in better hands.  It regrettably joins the plethora of bad coming-of-age Vietnam movies of the early 80s, and in about the same timeframe. <br /> <br />Cinematography:  ban bleach-bypass!  It was OK in Three Kings, but is way overused by now. <br /> <br />And the cover of the regular DVDs: check out Jamie Foxx's expression.  A classic, especially after the later Brokeback Mountain.
B000E1YVZU|2.0|Musicals (and Operas) aren't my forte - although I did enjoy CHICAGO and MOULIN ROUGE - so I was hesitant to check out RENT. But after reading about its notable comparisons to La Boheme, and how consumption was replaced by HIV/AIDS, I was intrigued enough to pick up a copy and find out what director Chris Columbus (what an unfortunate name) did with it.<br /><br />I guess I should've stuck with my original movie-musical/opera instincts.<br /><br />RENT is exactly what it claims to be, a musical; and perhaps a bit too much of one. At every opportunity - whether it seems justifiable or not - the cast breaks out into song. I know, I know. It's a musical. What did I expect?<br /><br />Maybe I've been spoiled by the two aforementioned postmodern musicals. CHICAGO AND MOULIN ROUGE told stories through both good narratives and great songs. And they didn't force-feed the audience musical number after musical number after musical number. Let me explain further ...<br /><br />RENT is a modern parable about bohemians living in New York's East Village. They're either all struggling artists, lovers, or victims of the HIV epidemic ...or, sometimes, they're all three (depending on which character you choose to follow). They all live in a substandard building and are having trouble paying the rent (begin opening chorus here). Anthony Rapp stars as Mark Cohen, a failed movie-maker who's coming to terms with the loss of his overtly sexy - and apparently bisexual - girlfriend Maureen (Idina Menzel). He's also been filming all of his friends lives and it is this that gives most of the movie its emotional weight. Adam Pascal plays Roger, Mark's roommate. Roger is dealing with his HIV status by remaining a shut-in after having lost a girlfriend to AIDS. But then Mimi (Rosario Dawson) moves in downstairs and Roger is tempted to fall in love again. But his HIV status and his broken heart keep them apart ...in addition to the fact that Mimi is a drug addict and is HIV positive, too. Jesse L. Martin plays Tom Collins (ha-ha), an out of work MIT instructor who returns to the Village to find his friends self-destructing and, amazingly, to find love in the arms of another HIV positive man, Angel (played by an excellent Wilson Jermaine Heredia).<br /><br />It is Angel - I think - that is supposed to represent the glue that holds these ragtag bohemians together, but we see so little of him (up until the hospital scenes where he's dying) that this aspect was nearly lost on me.<br /><br />There are some decent film moments. Some of the more memorable ones (for me) were during the opening when the power to the building they're all living in is shut off and everyone burns something to stay warm, then throws the burning embers out the windows of this multi-story structure (nice imagery). I also liked the scenes involving the HIV support group that showed its members gradually disappearing, a reminder to viewers that HIV tends to be fatal to a huge percentage of those that become infected.<br /><br />But the songs just couldn't hold the movie together. Most of them had the exact same tempo (with the exception of maybe one or two) and blurred or blended together, making me not really care what they were singing about. And with a musical so packed full of songs, that's pretty bad.oo. Jesse L.

B0000AFQRZ|4.0|When i saw the dvd in store,i did not know there was a special edition with another disc,so i made a mistake of buying the DELUXE edition.I had seen the film years ago and i must admit that they did a fine remastering job.The complete A QUICK ONE WHILE HE IS AWAY is the most welcomed addition.This was the prelude of their rock operas.When in good form,THE WHO were the best group of their era in live performances.Apart from WHO'S NEXT,they were never as good at making records.This group only came alive on stage.This is what PETE actually says when he admits that he is another person on or off the stage.The anarchic spirit made the group unique,but also killed their drummer KEITH MOON, who could not stop the teenage wasteland syndrome.This film was actually made by a fan of the group who understood them,and it shows when they perform WON'T GET FOOLED AGAIN in the end.Don't forget to buy the SPECIAL EDITION
0790729601|4.0|Eraser is Arnie's last wholly enjoyable actioner before the rot set in. Overshadowed at the time by The Rock, it's a much better proposition by far. Co-written by Wild Bunch scribe Walon Green and co-starring Peckinpah regular James Coburn, it's full of subtle and not so subtle Sam Peckinpah references in general and The Killer Elite in particular - not only does that film's star, James Caan, play the Robert Duvall role this time round, but after the film's dockyard bust-up he even ends the film walking with a cane again. Fortunately, unlike Peckinpah's laziest film, the action scenes here are handled with a gusto and energy by director Chuck Russell that both embraces and excuses their absurdity, whether it be Arnie playing chicken with a jet while hanging from a parachute or taking on a reptile house full of killers and escaped alligators (\\"You're luggage!\\"). And if you like Alan Silvestri's score, you can hear it again in Judge Dredd! <br /> <br />The DVD doesn't have much going for it - just a trailer and widescreen or fullscreen versions of the film - but it's not the kind of film that needs much in the way of extras anyway.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I am a huge fan of Star Wars and have been since age 10.  I now have complete set of all of the movies and love to watch them.
B0007CNXUK|4.0|Finding Neverland is a bit of a charmer that's much better than it has any right to be but not nearly as good as it could have been with a bit more nerve. Whereas The Lost Boys (no, not the vampire one), Andrew Birkin's BBC take on the relationship between J.M. Barrie and the Llewellyn-Davies children who inspired his greatest work, was all sombre darkness and little light, Marc Forster's film could do with a little more shading, and it's a tribute to Johnny Depp's abilities that he manages to avoid turning Barrie into Tinkerbell or, worse, Mrs Doubtfire. His understated charm gives the whimsy wings even when the direction and photography fails to quite convince. It's the smaller moments that really convince - the genuinely touching moment with a widow after the premiere of Peter Pan beautifully touches on the sense of loss that fuelled the play, as does the moment he notices the oldest of the children suddenly growing up.  <br /> <br />The other players meet with mixed fortunes. Kate Winslett is just Kate Winslett, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, Freddie Highmore impresses as Peter, Dustin Hoffman is reliably worldworn, but Julie Christie's wicked stepmother is always on the brink of parody (but then Christie never was much of an actress). Rhada Mitchell tries hard to avoid turning Mrs Barrie into a heartless stereotype, but the script is so busy celebrating Barrie's free spirit that it only briefly touches on the way he shuts her out of his imagination. The DVD also includes a wonderful in-character out-take of Depp expressing his admiration for the capacity of his dog's bladder that is worth the price of the disc on its own. <br /> <br />
B00005R62K|5.0|To metalheads, this album is a CLASSIC! There was absolutely nothing like this when it came out. Even though the band's last two albums were heavy for their time, this album kicked the heaviness up a notch. Several notches in fact! Exciter is a metal classic, and a perfect opener. Rob wails like there is no tomorrow and the solos on here rule. Gotta love the double bass that Les Binks throws in here. This is old school speed metal, no kidding! White Heat Red Hot slows things down, but still stays heavy. This track is pretty darn catchy, I love Rob's vocals on here. Better by You Better Than Me is another catchy tune, but it is a cover of a Spooky Tooth song. I love the guitar on here, sounds like classic rock rather than heavy metal but it still rocks! Savage starts off with some high yells by Rob and this song just smokes, the chorus is definitely a highlight. How the heck can a man reach those notes? Heavy riffs on here too! Invader starts off with some cool guitar effects (sounds like a UFO landing) and goes into a kick ass song with a darn catchy chorus, I know you will sing this one to yourselves! Even the guitar solo is catchy! <br /> <br />Saints in Hell is a HEAVY song. The riffs on here are so heavy, I mean they practically beat you upside the head. I LOVE it when Rob shrieks \\"Wake the dead, the saints are in hell!\\" You know you love that! Heroes End has some killer riff-work, and just flat out rocks. Stained Class has that famous galloping riff we all know and love and some of the notes Rob hits here are amazing! The guitar solo on here is very melodic, and I love it when, towards the end, the song gets heavier. Back then, those were probably some of the heaviest riffs ever heard! <br /> <br />Beyond the Realms of Death is a f*cking masterpiece. The acoustic work is beautiful, and when the song picks up and Rob begins his yelling, your mind will be blown I guarantee it! No one can convey the emotion that Rob does during the slow parts! Glenn's solo is breathtakingly emotional, while K.K.'s is fast paced and crushing. It all ends with Rob's brilliant shriek of \\"BEYOND THE REALMS OF DEATH\\". Very nice. The bonus tracks include a cool live version of Better by You Better Than Me and Fire Burns Below. It has nice keyboard playing and is very experimental. Too bad it wasn't released earlier (I hear it was meant for Turbo or Ram it Down, I can't remember). I am sorry but you NEED to have this album if you want to be a metalhead, this pushed metal LIGHT YEARS beyond what it was at the time. No one else played these heavy riffs at all. So buy this album and enjoy what these guys gave us!
B000002U9Y|5.0|Why people are calling this floyd's \\"sophmote jinx\\" album is far beyond me! Was their debut all that much better? The songs on this album don't totally flow together like some of floyd's tend to,but maybe separation was the intention with \\"saucerful...\\". I think that folks who can only get into \\"the wall\\",\\"dark side...\\",or \\"animals\\" might have difficulty discovering the depth of songs like  the title track; dismissing them as \\"noise\\",\\"druggie banter\\",or \\"playing around\\". Do you really need to understand the music you listen to,have vocals on a song,or be able to play the songs exactly how they sound for the sounds to be thought of as good? I listen to the Melvins,Sigur Ros,and Bluebob and 99% of the time I have no idea where the songs are going or why they are taking on the forms they do;they're still impressive pieces of art none-the-less!<br /><br />p.s.if you like floyd check out buckethead's \\"electric tears\\" or \\"colma\\" albums to listen in on another inventive mind at work!
B000002GYI|4.0|In the early 80s, keyboard dominated music was the new cool thing, and a lot of it was in debt to this brilliant German band. Computer World came out in the midst of the bands they influenced, so the timing was perfect. Computer World starts things off nicely, some great synth playing here. I love the way these guys can carry emotion with electronic intsruments. Very nice atmosphere. The voice that goes \\"Business, numbers, \\" etc. I believe was made on a Speak and Spell toy. Pocket Calculator is a very happy-sounding song. Sounds like one of those old Atari video games. The lyrics are a little corny, but oh well, these guys just sang what they wanted to sing! Very cool song. Numbers is an okay song, it doesn't do much for me though. Not that it is bad, it is just okay. Computer World 2 has the same synth melody as the first Computer World song, but played differently. It provides a very nice, calm sound that is great to relax to. <br /> <br />Home Computer starts off with some more \\"Atari\\" sounds, and then goes into kind of a dark melody. The keyboards on here are quite stellar. Very melodic and catchy. It's More Fun to Compute is rather creepy, the synth sounds are very dark and can send a chill down your spine. Still a pretty good song though. Computer Love is a flat out beautiful song. The way the words \\"Computer love\\" are sang is just magnificent. Lots of emotion, not just in the singing, but in the synths as well. It is seven minutes long, but I wish it were longer. <br /> <br />I warn you, Kraftwerk songs can get quite repetitive, but I don't mind it at all, probably because they make such wonderful music! I don't even like dance music, but these guys are definitely blessed with pure musical talent. If you like 80s music, I would recommend this one. Even if you hate dance music as much as I do, I would still look into it!
B000683VI4|5.0|I read the book and watched the movie 3 times. The movie was as good as the book which is not always true with movies that are produced from books. Applause to the director, producer and artists that starred... it is a number one film on my list!
0312117337|5.0|Apart from the sheer beauty of the cards and wisdom of the supporting text these cards are also amazing as they are so useable.  No long studying of tarot required.  From day one they have added to my daily growth and provided support and clarity when need.  I would recommend them to everyone!
B0000026J1|2.0|Yep, much as I love this band and have copped plenty of flack over the years for doing so, it has to be admitted that the wheels fell off for this one.<br /><br />First of all it's a total sell out. They wanted to be pop stars and not rock stars. In fact one of the reasons for John Norums departure was the desire of Joey Tempest to target the pop audience. Not a recipe for longevity and the boys should of known it.<br /><br />Secondly the songs sound like keyboard washed out takes of good songs. There are some hooks in the songs, and some emotion in the ballads though a reworking of ballads from earlier in your career in search of a hit is never a popular ploy with the fans.<br /><br />More grunt and less soft rock pomp should of been in order. Also not doing the north american leg of the Def Leppard tour would have to rate as one of the worst business decisions in hard rock history......<br /><br />But this was a temporary low
B000E6UK5K|5.0|<br />This is not a Pink Floyd album. It's important to get that out of the way because many people will want this to be a Pink Floyd album and will be disappointed because it's not. However this is an excellent David Gilmour album and he has a number of guest musicians on hand to deliver the goods, including Rick Wright. The album is well crafted and there is plenty here for the rock fan (including Floyd fans!) including some wonderful guitar solos. There is a lot of fun music here ('This Heaven' is so funky!). 'Then I Close My Eyes' is one of those laid back slow relaxing tracks - delicious! 'Smile' is a nice blend of acoustic and slide guitar. 'Where We Start' is a really lovely song. Even if you're a doubtful buyer, this album is well worth taking a chance on - you are unlikely to be disappointed, unless you are expecting to hear Pink Floyd...
B00005NNMK|4.0|This album was a serious contender in so many ways. I'll just justify my four stars in dot points and leave it at that because it's just so hard for me to try and pick apart one of the two albums that opened my eyes to the world of hard rock (the other being Slippery When Wet).<br /><br />#  Production values. Recorded in Switzerland and it sounds darn fine. This was a really modern sounding record and the vibrancy matches releases of today<br /><br />#  Full bodied songs. OK, apart from the hits we all got sick of (The Final Countdown sold 7 million copies alone) the songs have a full band feel. The world doesn't stop for the excellent vocal abilities of Joey Tempest - instead all the band gets some time in the spotlight.<br /><br />#  The playing is top notch, these guys didn't sit around drinking all day. Sometimes they practiced too! The fact that when Europe was on a hiatus these guys were in demand for other bands shows that their musical abilities were respected<br /><br />#  Last point, that being that these guys were heavier than many people gave them credit for at the time, or since for that matter and really, when it comes to crunch factor, they pretty much buried John Bon and his buddies.<br /><br />Nuff said.
0060254920|3.0|I saw alot of good reviews on this book, so I thought I'd get it. <br />It is not one of my favorites.  I have a 3yr old and we love books.  Better choices out there.
B000E33VWW|4.0|Truman Capote is still one of the most unique figures in American fiction, a gifted writer who never lived up to his promises, producing only a handful short stories and novels, yet managing to far surpass the quantity of his work as a self styled breathing piece of art,a quirky icon of jet set living, superficial glamour,addiction and the tragedy that was inevitable. His most famous work, a groundbreaking new type of novel, In Cold Blood, is also his most revealing. It is a story of brilliance and the depth that he sank to in order to achieve it. The film Capote spans the six year period in which the author gathered research for his nonfiction book, including the lies, exploitation, regret and heavy prize that went into producing one of America's greatest works of literature.<br /><br />In 1959, in the midst of celebrating the success of his novella Breakfast at Tiffany's, Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) discovers a small article describing the brutal murder of four family members in Holcomb, a sleepy little nest in Kansas. He doesn't hesitate long before traveling there, taking his trusted childhood friend Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), or Nelle as he calls her, with him. His strange lisping way of speaking and unusual demeanor at first cause only curiosity and suspicion, but with intelligence, resourcefulness, a little bribery and the help of his Nelle he manages to win the trust of the grieving locals, including the no nonsense chief investigator Alvin Dewey(Chris Cooper). It isn't long before two drifters, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino), are caught and charged with the murders. With his usual tactics of persuasion; Capote manages to approach the killers and is immediately fascinated by the sensitivity and vulnerability of half Native Perry Smith. By opening himself to the lonely man and arranging for an appeal by finding them a new lawyer, Capote gains not only Perry's trust, but important material for his book. What starts out as a somehow peculiar but tender friendship,soon turns into cruel manipulation on the part of Capote, as he puts pressure on Smith by exploiting his loneliness and finally halts all attempts to legally help them, knowing that the only satisfying end to his book could possibly be an execution.<br /><br />It is not so difficult to realize the dedication and love that went into making this film. Hoffman, though sharing only a vague resemblance and being taller then the actual Truman Capote, gives a fantastically disciplined performance. Truman Capote was an act, a one man show, all his vulnerability hidden beneath a loud, trashy and often vulgar exterior.Hoffmans Capote is an intellectual bearing an almost fictional character of loudness and exterior appeal,so used to betraying and hiding his true goodness in a world of superficiality, that the ultimate breakdown becomes inevitable. His good conscience and quite strength is Nelle Harper Lee,Catherine Keener in an absolutely likable performance,who is aware of his betrayal and does not pretend otherwise. She persuades Truman to give one last heart wrenching visit to Perry and Richard, confronting him with the truth, even though she realizes that it is tearing him up from the inside.Although Truman later pledges to Perry that he did everything in his powers to help them, showing true regret and deep felt grief, there is no more deception in the final moment. Perry knows what Truman knows. In the end there is nothing but darkness waiting for both men. Perry is dressed in a hood moments before he is hanged, breathing heavily with fright in the dark, while Truman must carry his own personal hood for the rest of his life. \\"There is nothing I could have done to save them, he tells Nelle. \\"Maybe, she answers, fact is, you didn't want to.\\"<br /><br />Although perfectly imitating Capotes demeanor,Hoffman's Capote is yet a bit more appealing and the collapse of his moral character more dramatic then what happened in reallife. The real Capote was certainly more of a superficial and vulgar character then film allows and an important factor of his eventual downfall was the social alienation he experienced later in life, rather then only the methods he used to obtain research information, however unscrupulous.

0446691437|5.0|I stumbled across this book thinking it was the Art of War - boy was I surprised and delighted.  It is the best book I have read in the last three years.  It has taken me close to 150 books to find this gem.  I haven't been able to put it down since I got it.  I re-visit it almost daily.  It has changed my entire perspective on how I start each and every day.    You MUST read this book if you are feeling a general dissatisfaction, a measure of restlessness, a low grade misery, or you are just plain disgusted with the way your life is heading. Pressfield calls these experiences Resistance.  He then tells you what to do about them.   You may not like all of what he has to say or even agree with it, however it will force you to decide what is important to you and above all TO ACT on it!  What ever \\"it\\" is.  Whether it be writing, painting, or study you don't have to be an artist to benefit from this wisdom and his instruction. As a student, I felt he was speaking directly to me.    Here are three things that stuck with me:  \\"There never was a moment, and never will be, when we are without the power to alter our destiny.  This second, we can turn the tables on Resistance.  This second, we can sit down and do our work.\\"    \\"We have two lives:  the life we live and the unlived life we dream about. Resistance fills the gap in-between.\\"    The hard part of sitting down to study -  is not necessary the study itself it is the sitting down part.  \\"The battle must be fought a new every day.\\"      From a student that didn't study - but does now.

B00004SAJK|4.0|My \\"old buddies\\" might say that when Michael Schenker left UFO that was the end. Not So! You still have Mogg, Way, Parker and the great chemistry developed over many years of rocking together. Granted, Paul Chapman has a different style than the great Schenker (few could match the precise shredding power of the wonderkid). Mechanix is still a good Rock-N-Roll CD. I might go as far to say the sweetest ballad (slower tune) ever recorded by UFO was \\"Back Into My Life\\" #3 on the CD. If you'r looking for old school UFO you won't find it here. What you will find is a familiar sound and all the ingredients that made UFO great. Check it out, that axeman Chapman ain't no slouch! ALWAYS NEVER THE SAME!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|We totally enjoyed this film!  It does help to have read the book first or watch it twice :).
B00004NJJQ|5.0|Another fine classic from the masters. Possibly one of thier best! I've listened to this \\"Jewel\\" hundreds of times over the years and I never tire of it. Besides the better known Doctor Doctor and Rock Bottom (along With a couple easy going ballads thrown in to disply their diversity) it contains perhaps the best UFO song ever recorded in Space Child. It's still quite amazing why UFO never got the recognition they deserve. Pioneers, Rockers, or whatever you call them, UFO leaves a legacy of great guitar work and originality for connoisseurs of all ages to discover and enjoy. WELCOME TO THE BEST!
6305907145|5.0|Well done!  It is up to par with the other Jane Austen films. A must see and own!
B00003OO3O|5.0|If you are new to UFO, Shame on you! They are probably the best Rock-N-Roll band you've never heard of! This CD is along the same lines as their No Heavy Petting, Obsession, Lights Out and, Phenomenon albums. ALL are great and from the same era. Force It is so easy to listen to and, like most UFO albums, there are no bad songs to skip. A unique blend of scorching guitar from the great Michael Schenker on rockers like Let It Roll, Shoot Shoot, Mother Mary & Out In The Street, to the flowing ballad High Flyer and the light and airy tune Love Lost Love. The versitality on this one make it a keeper for sure! A special treat for true Rock-N-Roll fans everywhere. Shhhhh...next thing you know everyone will want one! THIS KID LOVES IT!
0312995423|2.0|After DaVinci Code I had become great fan of Dan Brown and was on a reading marathon to complete all of his publications. The expectations were high and were met decently enough for Angles and Demons but this book did not. Beleive me, half way through the book you can easily realize how the plot was to end. NOT WORTH IT.
B00003CXRM|4.0|This is a good family type movie. George Clooney does a great job with his character.
B0007M22TI|5.0|All of the performers in this concert featuring Irish female singers is extraordinary.  The clarity in tone and pitch for all of the singers is first rate.  I really loved the little blond hottie violin player who plays as well as she looks.
B00007LTIA|5.0|Back in college, I had a classmate who was wild into the Grateful Dead. I think I kind of rubbed her the wrong way, because \\"Truckin'\\" was all I knew of the Dead, but I was a major Yes fan.<br /><br />If you like Yes, this is about as good as it gets. Four songs, each an album side. Rocking, but meditative. Intricate and thoughtful, but energetic. The liner notes give the \\"blah blah blah\\" (which I learned from, don't get me wrong), but the music sounds really good, after all these years of now-scratchy LP listening. Sounds great on an iPod!<br /><br />Well, time has gone on, and I've listened to a lot more of the Dead. I appreciate the Dead more than then, but having re-immersed in \\"Tales,\\" I am really really pleased. (BTW, there are a couple alternate versions in addition to the original album lineup. On first listen, they're at least okay.)<br /><br />Oh, if you want three minute songs like they used to play on the radio, this album is definitely not for you. Try \\"American Beauty\\" (or Yes Fragile).<br /><br />Signed,<br /><br />A Fan
B000BNI90O|5.0|Cannot really put into words how great this is.  Cannot wait for the versions for TT and ROTK to come out.  Was not really a fan of the soundtrack in it's abridged form, here you get everything.
B000E5N62U|4.0|This album seems to get better every listen.At first I was thinking this is not Nightfly.This album sounds more like Steely Dan's Everything Must Go.Its filled with smooth jazzy sounds from subdued to perky.Although none of the tracks really stood out like his other albums its still Fagen singing about the dark side of life.If you like to relax this is for you.If you want a perkier album resort back.Songs that did stand out Security Joan,What I Do,H-Gang and Mary Shut The Garden Door.Its worth buying......Definately!
B00006JDVV|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I was very impressed by it. The story was creative and different from all other dragon movies I have ever seen. I was expecting this movie to be a King Authur with Dragons type of movie, so I was not expecting anything great except a stunning performance from Gerard Butler. This is a great movie to own if you have surround sound because the sound effects, especially the dragon's roar, are great and will literally make you jump out of your seat. I was also impressed by Christian Bale's performance. For all of you Matthew McConaughey fans, you will want this movie. He is almost hard to recognize with his beard and shaved head, but he is sexy and sports a great body along with Chrstian Bale. Gerard Butler's performance is fabulous as always. He is the comic relief in this movie. The only thing that bothered me about this movie was that they had a helicopter in 2010 when the entire world was burned... so where in the world did they get the fuel to make it fly? I am glad I bought this movie though, I think it was a great addition to my collection. I recommend this movie to all people who enjoy something different but scary at the same time, to all people who like dragon movies, and to all fans of Matthew McConaughey, Christian Bale, and Gerard Butler.
B000E6UK5K|3.0|David Gilmours On An Island is laid back rock.Although I could listen to it all the way through I found myself drifting off.Oh thats not a bad thing when you're relaxing but not driving.Songs like Take a Breath,Smile,This Heaven,and The Blue are just some examples.Its not a great album but its listenable.Perhaps it will grow on me more when I'm painting my house then to bring it out at parties.I mean I wouldn't want to put anyone to LA LA Land.He's showing his age thats for sure.If I had to do comparisons......It sounds more like Pink Floyds Animals than anything else.Enjoy it....Just get in some strong coffee!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|The Phantom of the Opera is the best movie I have seen in years. Having read Gaston Leroux's version, and not seeing the stage version, I was expecting a horror story. When I realized it was actually a romance I was hesitant to watch it because I am not a fan of romance movies, but as soon as the overture began playing I was complelely sucked in. The music was unlike anything I had ever heard before and I fell in love with it. I also did not recognize any of the actors except for Miranda Richarson and Minnie Driver. I also knew who Gerard Butler was from Tomb Raider but did not recognize him at all. I thought the three main actors (Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, and Patrick Wilson) were singers they picked off Broadway or the Opera. Their performances were breathtaking. This is the only movie that I can watch a hundred times and cry everytime. Gerard Butler breaks my heart as the Phantom. Emmy Rossum was amazing and incredibly beautiful as Christine. Patrick Wilson was a perfect Raoul. I was a little disapointed that he did not have as much screen time as I was expecting, because in Leroux's version the story follows Raoul through the story. In Andrew Lloyd Webber's version the story seems to follow Christine. I think Raoul could have been included in a little more of the story, but I still give the movie the highest rating I can give. Altogether, even though the movie is quite a bit different from the book, it will still remain one of my favorite movies of all time. This movie is one of those films that sucks you right into the story, and you start to feel for the characters, especially the Phantom, as though they were real people. You will fall in love right alongside Christine and Raoul and your heart will break right along with the Phantom's. It is an experience you will never forget and one you will want to have again. I recommend it to everyone.
B000BHHVPO|4.0|I went to the Philadelphia show and so I missed a bunch of the other acts from around the world so I bought the DVD. I was not disappointed, it had, if not every, than close to every song preformed and I was even able to see myself on the third disk, pretty cool. Sound and video are pretty good, def dvd worthy. Only thing I fault is that it takes a good chunk of afternoon to watch, it draggs out a while. But overall, as long as the skip button works its a good compilation of world class artists.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Equilibrium is incredible. Having seen The Matrix, I was not particularly interested in watching this movie because I was expecting a copycat. Don't get me wrong, I really liked the Matrix, but I had no desire to see a film that tried to imitate it. I was very wrong. Equilibrium was way better than the Matrix, and is nothing like it. Some of the fight scenes might make you think of the Matrix but the two movies are not alike. Maybe it was the sword fighting and the gun fighting in the same scene that made it so great. Or maybe it was a clean shaven, slicked-backed-haired Chritian Bale. Christian Bale's performance is unforgetable. The incredible fight scenes and the way you can see his emotions starting to erupt in his eyes through his emotionless face. I also liked the lack of romance in this movie. I can't express how many action movies have gone to crap due to a sudden romance in the middle of the movie. There is some attraction between John Preston (Christian Bale) and Mary (Emily Watson) but there are no kissing or sex scenes or even a real romance between them. The attraction was needed to show that John Preston was starting to feel emotions, but it was none of that \\"Im in love with you, I want to marry you\\" junk that ruins action movies. I highly recommend this to everyone who loves a good action movie with incredible fight scenes. I also recommend this to everyone who liked The Matrix, I challenge all of you to compare the two films. I know that you will find the film to be equally good or better.
0307276902|5.0|this is a fabulous book. bottom line, if you want to read an amazingly written book that you cannot put down, then get this book. some details might be exaggerated, but pretend it is a fiction. memoir or fiction...it is still an amazing read. and my friend leonard was better.
B0001I55OC|4.0|I saw the movie before I read the book and really did enjoy it. I just recently read the book and I love it too, but If I had read the book first I probably would not have liked the movie nearly as much. That is why I think this movie does not have a very good rating. If you have not read the book, this is a very exciting movie and has an excellent score to it. I recommend the soundtrack as well as the movie. If you have read the book, then don't waste your time because you probably will not like it. I agree that the book was better than the movie, but I think the movie does deserve some credit. You will definately want this movie if you are a Paul Walker fan or a Gerard Butler fan. I myself was very fond of Gerard Butler playing Andre Marek. He made an excellent romantic warrior. Altogether, I think that Timeline was a very good movie and very exciting.
B00005K3NR|5.0|<br />Greetings. A year ago I wrote a review about this film in which I condemned it. I was wrong. The fact of the matter is that this film is a masterpiece. This film draws you in and makes you sympathize with Carrie. She is treated as an outcast and subjected to unspeakable acts of hatred by her peers. When I watched the film, I lost all sense of objectivity so much so that when she was humiliated at the prom I became angry with the movie itself. I forgot that the ability of a movie to draw the audience in, to make it sympathize with the characters, is the mark of a great horror movie. That is why some of the Universal monsters from the 30's and 40's, Frankenstein and the Wolf Man, are considered classics. You feel remorse for these characters because they are outcasts, forever cursed, and unable to controll their violent natures. And so it is with Carrie White: a shy, angry victim of horrible abuse who eventually gets pushed too far. I apologize to the filmmakers for my earlier ignorance. <br />Moreover, this film is more important now than ever before. We all remember those terrible killings at Columbine High School. To anyone who wonders why such a thing could happen, I suggest you watch this movie. We'll never know for certain what prompted those kids to storm into that school with guns and kill with no remorse and no mercy. But \\"Carrie\\" presents us with some possible answers. I think that underneath all of the horror in this film there is a positive message: we need to treat one another with love and dignity. I am an avid \\"Star Trek\\" fan. I believe that we can bring about that kind of productive, positive future--if we learn the lessons from \\"Carrie\\". <br /> <br />P.S. <br />   Dear Ms. Spacek, <br />       <br />       I once read somewhere that you were not very proud of your role in this film. You should feel very proud!! It took a great deal of courage for you to accept this role, in my opinion. Violence in our schools is a horrible problem. Your film brings that problem out into the limelight. That is the first critical step in solving a problem: exposing it. I think that it should be required viewing for all high school students. By talking about it with their teachers and parents, maybe we wouldn't have anymore Columbines. You're a terrific actress as are all of the other actors and actresses in the film. <br /> <br />                         Sincerely, <br />                             Steven M. Cohen <br /> <br />  <br />
0441172717|5.0|let me just tell you all one thing... i loved this book... i have told (literally) hundreds of people about this book and much to my surprise they have read them all. i am floored by the imagination that this author had, this vision of a far off place that and an entire universe that relies heavily on the substane known as melange. yes the first installment is quite heafty and i do suggest reading continuously for this is not a book that can be read and then stopped and picked up later ( i know i did it and frequenlty caught myself going back to say where was i when that happened). this book has an incredible character development and in most books i would have a problem with how people can measure great distances and tell how much sand there is out there by making an educated guess, but with this book i came to understand that those guesses were not educated ones and they were the product of years of training and practice in the ways of the sister hood. i am not here to critique this book in any way , but merely offer my feelings about the book so that others can experience the adventure i had in the depths of my mind when everything in the world was silent and i was out on Arrakis, in those stillsuits right behind paul all the way to the last page ( sure some translation was needed, thank gaia for that damned encyclopedia/dictionary in the back of the book). <br />i know that what i just said is so cliche, but i dont care, people dont need complex thoughts written down or very harsh words to say that a book was not good, or that the plot needs more work, but what they do need to know is whether or not the book was worth the read. i am here to tell you all it was. i swore i would never read a series of books in my life, but i renounce that claim and am here to say that i am now a dune junkie. hello sci fi sagas and series, my name is tyler durden (this is my alias)and i am here to stay. so for those who are afraid of the stigma that comes with being labled as a scifi freak of nature, for all those people that are trekies and star war people who are apart of the extended universe (even though i may never fully understand you) keep on treken and may the force be with you and for those who speak the language of the freemen bi-la kaifa.
B00004Y6NP|4.0|I've always been a half-hearted Dire Straits fan.  I own several of their albums and I saw them live on this tour.  It's hard for any music fan to dislike Dire Straits, but I do find them hard to \\"love\\".  I suppose the main reason for that is that Mark Knopfler's style is so unique that it's hard to escape.  In some ways, every Dire Straits album sounds almost the same to me.  This is the main reason I can't give Brothers In Arms a 5-star rating.  In fact, I'm not even sure I'd agree that this is their best release.  Both Making Movies and Love Over Gold are also extremely good releases. <br /> <br />Despite all that, there are some great tunes on this album.  Check out So Far Away, Walk of Life, The Man's Too Strong, and Brothers in Arms for great examples of what makes Mark Knopfler one of the best guitarists of his day. <br /> <br />The other outstanding aspect of this album is the recording itself.  The sound quality is superb, much like Love Over Gold.  I could listen to this album over and over merely for the sound. <br /> <br />There probably aren't many people out there that are completely unfamiliar with Dire Straits after Sultans of Swing and Money For Nothing.  If you are, I'm not sure there's anything I can tell you to help you to decide whether or not you'd like this album.  For the other 99.9% of us, though, if you like any Dire Straits at all, you most certainly will not be disappointed with Brothers In Arms.
B000063JDE|3.0|Director David Lynch's \\"Blue Velvet\\", a definite moiety of the theatre of the absurd, puzzles me as to what relevance it has to any sense of reality.  Lynch gets kudos for his ability to shock the viewer with his bizarre characterizations and plot but to consider this film a masterpiece is a stretch.<br /><br />Frequent Lynch troupe member Kyle MacLachlan plays Jeffrey Beaumont a straight laced college boy and inhabitant of small town Lumberton.  He's brought home owing to an accident and subsequent hospitalization of his father.  Strolling home after a visit with his dad, in a field nearby his home he discovers a severed human ear lying in the grass.  He brings it to the local police detective Williams but is intrigued by the mystery of it's presence.<br /><br />He soon meets up with Det. Williams high school hottie daughter Sandy played by Laura Dern.  She tells MacLachlan that her father has suspicions that the ear is somehow connected to a gal that leaves in an apartment near to the field.  In a sophomoric bit of snooping they decide to break into her apartment.  While inside MacLachlan has to hide in the closet as she unexpectedly comes back home.  The gal is a frazzled local night club singer played by Isabella Rossellini.  From his hiding spot he observes the arrival of Dennis Hopper, who is excellent in this movie, playing drug addled sadistic psycho Frank Booth.  Hopper who apparently has kidnapped Rossellini's husband and son, has forced her to be his sex slave.  After slapping her around for awhile and indulging in some depraved sexual byplay, he departs after threatening her.<br /><br />The shocked MacLachlan feels sympathy for Rossellini.  He gets more deeply involved in a sick, perverted world that exists just below the surface of this sleepy, typical middle American town as he investigates the strange goings on around town.  He gets more than he bargained for as he and Dern experience the crazed world created by the evil Hopper.<br /><br />As an aside, Dean Stockwell is amusing as a heavily made up pimp of a bordello frequented by his good friend Hopper.  In addition infrequent screen presence Brad Dourif of \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest\\" has a bit part in this weird flick.an aside, Dean Stockwell is amusing as a heavily made up pimp of a bordello frequented by his good friend Hopper.

B000EBD9TY|5.0|Yes, this is an iconic performance given by Brando as the loutish Stanley, who operates on a different level of sexual manipulation than the equally manipulative Blanche. They both know \\"Death--the opposite is desire\\" and the struggle to win is as riveting now as when the film was first shown. <br /> <br />But the audiences with whom I have seen this film have come to see the brutish Brando tear his T-sirt and cry Stella, but have all left discussing one of the greatest performances ever committed to film, that of the great Vivien Leigh. <br /> <br />She not only drifts out to madness is a sea of words, but she is alternately cruel and vulnerable as she does so. It is truly harrowing to watch this intelligent creature struggle so hard to find the salvation she seeks in this squalid New Orleans of the 50s.  <br /> <br />Brando has claimed that Leigh was the perfect Blanche--and, as such-the film becomes about this tortured creature (whose very worst punisher is herself)perhaps more than the play ever was. The Pulitzer radio broadcast indicates that even the original Blanche (Jessica Tandy) was unable to make the Williams text as organic. <br /> <br />The new dvd edition promises a lot of extras and a glowing new transfer. It's about time that this great performance of Leigh's got all the right home video attention!
B00005JKOI|2.0|Fun to watch film, great plot with good teens, bad teens and the influence of peer pressure in high school.  A real blast looking back at James Spader who starred in many great films and currently on Boston Legal and Jon Cryer currently in 2 and a half men.  Both were great in their opposing sides of the track during those highly impressionable years in senior high.  Regardless of the years that pass, the high school pressure is the same.  Not sure what happened to Molly Ringwald or Andrew McCarthy, Annie Potts, but Spader and Cryer are on an obvious roll.
B00003CXB4|1.0|Maybe I'll get flack about this, but here's an opinion from an angle I don't see anyone else presenting. <br /> <br />Does anyone care what kids are unconsciously learning from movies like this? Yes, Disney did a fine job of blending great animation, music, humour, and plot. But what messages are children learning in this movie?  <br /> <br />Children love the music in this movie. Just show it to your kid enough times and they'll be going around the house singing the songs and acting out the characters. Three of the most notable songs are windows into the personalities and agendas of the main characters. There's Scar's song when he's singing to the hyenas about how everything will be great when he becomes the new king, and how he's going to achieve this by killing King Mufassa. The whole scene is lifted right out of those old news reels of Hitler addressing the Nazi army, right down to a goose-stepping hyena army. What's a child learning from this behavior? Getting what you want/power through violence. <br /> <br />Another main song is \\"Just Can't Wait to be King\\", where young Simba sings about how great it will be to finally be king- no one will tell him what to do anymore, he'll do whatever he wants, and order everybody around. This is a great attitude to teach a child who doesn't listen to his/her parents, or who has behavior problems.  <br /> <br />Another biggie is \\"Hakuna Matata\\", (Swahili for \\"no worries\\"). Simba's new friends Pumba and Timone counsel the grief-and-guilt-laden Simba not to care about the past, or really anything, or anyone else, just live for yourself, \\"eat, drink, and be merry...\\" This is a great one for teaching kids about responsibility, and NOT dealing with real-life issues.  <br /> <br />Sure, these songs are all done in fun, and yes, in the end, Simba learns what it really means to be a leader (responsibility), and defeats his murderous Uncle Scar, but interestingly, there's no song to reinforce that. Young kids pick up on the attitudesin the individual scenes and songs- defiance, rebelliousness against authority, power through violence, self-centerdness, indifference... Young kids don't have the attention span to connect these attitudes with their consequences.  <br /> <br />There are several overt tribal spiritual messages in the movie as well, not to mention a couple of violent scenes, which might be too much for some kids. <br /> <br />A lot of people will probably think I'm reading too much into this. But young kids are very impressionable, especially when they're engrossed in something like a powerful movie that holds them spellbound.  <br /> <br />Long story short, it's important to watch TV and videos with your kids, and screen what they watch first. It allows you to see what they are (unconsciously) learning, and correct any ideas you don't want them to imitate. And yes, the endless commercials at the beginning of the DVD are rediculous. I don't think anybody can beat Disney on trying to capitalize on a captive audience.
B00005JO1R|4.0|This review is not to argue the merits of the film. \\"Walk the Line\\" is a wonderful story of love and redemption. Reese Witherspoon deserved her Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of June Carter, and Joaquin Phoenix's performance is of equal caliber. It's a great movie, definitely worth seeing. <br /> <br />The reason for this posting is to tell people that the Collector's Edition is a waste of money. The bonus features in this more expensive version are a huge disappointment. After watching the film you would hope to see a revealing documentary about the real people. However, there's no footage of Johnny or June singing, no interviews with them, nothing but a couple of still photos. The three bland featurettes are just a series of clips from the film and some interviews where people \\"talk about\\" Johnny and June. What a wasted opportunity. <br /> <br />If you want to buy the movie, stick with the basic version and save yourself a few bucks.  <br />
B00000JCOV|5.0|SLIPKNOT!  While not the first band to play this form of speed metal they are the first band to really take the mainstream by the horns and gain MASS success.  For anyone who says that this band isn't commercial is missing the point that is Slipknot.  This is the first band of this brutality to BECOME commercial and that in itself is why you either love or hate them.  The people who pass them up because you can hear them on the radio are fooling themselves.  Slipknot proves that you don't have to be broke and play out your days in an underground club to be metal music.  You don't have to ONLY get airtime on 'Headbangers Ball' to be concidered heavy.  Just listen to 'EYELESS' which is brutal and 'LIBERATE' or the opener '(sic)' which is even moreso...I mean even 'WAIT AND BLEED' which is their radio single is still brutal!  It's in no way a sell out.  This is one freaking killer album by one brutal band and whats awsome about Slipknot is that throughout all of their releases they have stayed true to themselves and have still retained the media's support.  YES, you will hear them on MTV, but that's because the world loves them.  They are no better than the underground metal acts, but the point is that they are no worse either.  They just knew how to work the media to gain popularity where no other band had done so before.
B00005JOIF|3.0|Any movie on this highly volatile and flammable topic by default invites curiosity and audience. The movie however turns out be a spaghetti mix that makes a vain attempt to show both the Palestinian and Israeli perspectives.  <br />The protagonist in the form of Avner starts of as a quiet team leader, turns into an obsessive head-hunter, defies initial marching orders and after a near-complete mission suffers from pangs of repentance. The end is too hackneyed for a sensitive, volatile and serious topic.  <br />In my opinion, this movie should have been directed from a reporter's perspective who does not take sides, but very simply reports on the events from a neutral perspective.

6305949980|5.0|Where do you begin with this movie?  I've loved it since I was a teenager and saw it in its original theatrical release.  As time goes on it has become a must watch during the Halloween and Christmas holidays as well as something that I have been able to share with my nieces and nephew.  I love this movie and is one of my true all time favorites.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is a CD every dancing music lover should definitely own. <br />I really enjoy listening to all the songs on the CD; they are great, thank you Madonna. <br />
B0007GAEGC|3.0|The short version:  You can tell these ladies aren't standing between a real orchestra and a responsive audience.<br /><br />I grabbed this disk from the bins because I'd been stolen by their broadcast on PBS.  It was live, and they glittered in appearance, voice and personality.<br /><br />One of the signature things about \\"Irish\\" music is the simplicity of the instrumentals in reverance to the vocalist, and the power and spirit of said singer.  To that end, this album is as much lullabay and pop as it is classical, which is not a bad thing as it keeps tradition alive.<br /><br />I was entranced by the PBS production, yet on further reflection I realize the pull came as much from their drawing forth crowd reactions as from sheer musical poweress.  While none of the voices is weak, neither are they awesome on this album, and so unfortunately did not live up to my expectations.  Would I give them a second try?  Sure -- but I'd listen to the disk first before I bought it.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I was very disappointed with this movie and surprised by my disappointment. I had been looking forward to a big screen version for a long time.     But the screenwriter took too many liberties with her script, adding lines that were both out of character and out of place. There's really no need to embellish when you have a book as good as Pride and Prejudice. The departures from the text not only distracted me, some of them actually made me cringe! \\"You have bewitched me body and soul,\\" Darcy whispers at one point. It sounds as if the writer is attempting to write like Austen (or any author, for that matter, pre-1900), but she doesn't know how! And it gets even worse when Elizabeth explains to her father (and I'm paraphrasing as I don't plan on watching the film again soon), \\"We are SO similar! He and I are both stubborn.\\" Clearly, the screenwriter has abandoned all attempts to even sound like Austen. And \\"goddess divine?\\" - she cut some of P&P's best lines to add THAT!    The quality of the acting is okay, but Keira Knightley doesn't exude the grace and wisdom that her predecessors, Jennifer Ehle and Greer Garson, did. She looks lovely but too fierce. I think it may be her jaw. She delivers her lines as if she may bite at any moment. I never envisioned Elizabeth Bennet as an angry sort of girl - spirited, yes, but not spit-in-your-face angry like she is in this movie. I think Rachel Weisz would have made a great Elizabeth (although she might be considered too old for the part - hey, if Emma Thompson can play Elinor Dashwood...)    Rosamund Pike, on the other hand, is perfect as Jane - much better than the actress in the A&E version. Matthew MacFadyen is appropriately swoonworthy with an impressively deep voice (and tall enough, too, as Mr. Darcy should always be). Brenda Blethlyn is good, but I had this strange deja vu watching the film, as if she had played this role before. One more thing: what's up with Bingley's hair? He looked like Conan O'Brien or the villainin The Incredibles and acted like a buffoon. It doesn't make much plot sense b/c he should be worthy of Jane's affection and admiration.    For fans of the novel, I can't recommend this film. The filmmakers have played too fast and loose with the details that make Austen distinctly Austen. Instead, check out Sense and Sensibility for how an adaptation should be done.
0780020685|5.0|I am new to Samurai films but I heard about this one quickly and it wasn't disappointing. Very suspenseful with a few comic moments too. We had to watch it in two sessions as it is long.
B000E6UK5K|3.0|I can see why people might not like the CD.  Dave's guitar work and songwriting is very distinctive so of course you recognize it right away and it sounds like Pink Floyd.  But then, it is not like Pink Floyd in many ways too.  Sounds as if the Rick Wright influence is not there which I'm not sure if he helped on this album or not, but maybe that has something to do with it. <br /> <br />On a whole, the album is laid back.  Most Floyd albums have a lot of laid back sections, but they are normally interspersed with some Rockin',  this album doesn't really have that.  Also, that spacey feel of floyd is not quite as intense, but still there a little bit. <br /> <br />Also the lyrics on many songs seem to be written or heavily influence by his wife.  There is certainly nothing wrong with the lyrics, they are perfectly fine, but not exactly Floydian. <br /> <br />It is very true that some people will find a way to like this album because it is Dave Gilmour.  I forget who it was, John Lennon maybe who said \\"I could record myself coughing and people would think it's great\\".  And then there are people who will say it's rubbish just because it isn't exactly like Pink Floyd, which is really no fault of Dave's since he wasn't going for that. <br /> <br />All in all, I say the album is not a must-have, but if you're a huge fan than you will probably buy it and think it is good.  Dave claimed in an interview that it is some of the best work he has ever done.  I am sorry but I would have to disagree.  He also very much said he has no interest in touring with Floyd again, which sucks!  Roger Waters seems like he wants to now and it would mean a lot to me to be able to see them as I have never had the chance. <br /> <br />It is not exactly fair to qualify the goodness of the album with how close it is to Pink Floyd music, but I think a lot of people are yearning for more Floyd music and this is as close as it gets for the time being. <br /> <br />I will review each song below and compare them to Floyd work just to give you a sense of what they are like and since most people buying this album are Floyd fans. <br /> <br />Castellorization - Instrumental \\"intro\\" song.  Reminiscent of the instrumental intro songs on Momentary Lapse and Division Bell, but lacking the Rick Wright touch.  Eventually we hear Dave's sweet guitar and it is sweet.  The song seems like mostly an intro for the title track, and it does a good job in this respect. <br /> <br />On an Island - Probably strongest song on CD, laid back but good.  Starts off sounding like some of the earlier floyd albums in the awkward period after Syd left but before Roger rose to power, where the band was really finding themselves.  Later the guitar solos sound more like the later floyd stuff, like animals/wall era.  And for a flash I heard a few bars that are very much like Shine On You Crazy Diamond. <br /> <br />The Blue - More laid back.  Hard to compare to any floyd song really.  Dave's voice of course makes it sound a bit like floyd, but musically not floyd at all.  Not bad, but not really to my tastes.  The solo is of course cool, most like Division Bell solos probably, but exactly like them. <br /> <br />Take a Breath - Verging on upbeat!  I like this song alot and it probably rivals the title track for the best song on the CD.  Doesn't exactly sound like other Floyd stuff, if anything Momentary Lapse era sound.  The solo is Division Belly. <br /> <br />Red Sky At Night - Saxaphone Interlude.  Laid back saxophone, most like Division Bell I guess.  For what it's worth, I think it is Dave playing the sax.  Nothing wrong with the song per se, but I think it would be better if it was used to lead to something else which it doesn't really. <br /> <br />This Heaven - Comparitevly upbeat.  I like this song too.  Has a certain style to it, not sure how to put a name to it.  Has a strange time signature or something, but it is cool.  Hard to compare to any Floyd, suppose Momentary Lapse if anything. <br /> <br />Then I close My Eyes - Opens with a short \\"Number Nine\\" like introduction, but changes to a laid back instrumental with guitars of all sorts and a piano blending together for a pretty piece of music.  Division Bellish I suppose.  All in all, I could do without this song <br /> <br />Smile - Acoustic song.  Very laid back.  I like it.  The kind of song I'd like to play on my guitar on a warm summer day in a meadow somewhere.  Like the post-Barret pre-Dark Side era.  You know those few songs that were acoustic rather than psychedelic.  Maybe like \\"If' or \\"Fat old Sun\\" from Atom Heart Mother. <br /> <br />A Pocket Full Of Stones -  Starts off like spacey Signs of Life, turns into Being Green by Kermit the Frog when he starts singing except it is piano.  Hard to compare this to any other Floyd stuff.  The song is a bit weak to me. <br /> <br />Where we start - Another laid back song, but I like this one much better.  Not really like other floyd work, but I guess the solo sounds a bit Division Bellish. <br />

0393327655|1.0|My review will be as Sam's writing should have been....SIMPLE and CLEAR.  Mr. Harris writes in a complicated style.  His vocabulary is no doubt meant to impress his professors and scholar friends alike.  Unfortunately they don't buy his book in large numbers, the average person does. But his choice of vocabulary(read--keep a dictionary handy!)is not easy. Also, He starts an idea and in the middle of the sentence goes somewhere else...very easy to get lost!! He may have a worthwhile message but his presentation style will cause your eyes to rollback in your head just before you lose consciousness!
B00009V7P8|5.0|if it wasnt for me taking a chance on the movie closer and watching it and hearing his song \\"the blowers daughter\\" i probably would have never heard of damien rice. i enjoy his music. even tho i dont own one of his cd's but soon i hope*....i listne to the snippets of his songs all the time on amazon.  but i watch the music video all the time that is on the closer dvd. but yeah i would recommend him to anyone anyday.

B0000AQS0F|4.0|The series had a great story line as well as a great cast and crew.  It is a shame that it did not continue past the first season.  I enjoyed both the series and the movie based upon it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is an odd duck. It's a kind of science fiction western. It borrows conventions and language and settings from both genres. But this is one duck that soars. As we get to know the ensemble cast they start to become welcome visitors into our home, and the wacky universe in which they live, with characters swearing in Mandarin Chinese, starts to make a strange kind of sense. There's action and adventure galore, but the writing is also extremely funny.     Plus, if you enjoy the TV series (with all too few episodes), then you'll love the movie \\"Serenity\\" that continues (and to some extent concludes) some of the plotlines in the TV series.    If you haven't seen this series (or the movie yet), you're in for a treat.
0380730367|4.0|When a former client of Patrick Kenzie kills herself mere months after he warned off her stalker, Kenzie, out of a profound sense of guilt, investigates.  After reconciling with his former partner and lover, Angie Gennaro, the two stumble upon a the truth: that the client was systematically stripped of everything in her life until she committed suicide.  The responsible party is a man who does not like to be crossed, and has now set his sights on Kenzie and Gennaro.    After the ambiguous villains of \\"Gone Baby Gone\\", Dennis Lehane returns to a more traditional type of villain for his fifth Kenzie/Gennaro book, \\"Prayers for Rain.\\"  While nowhere the monstrous serial killer Lehane created in \\"Darkness, Take My Hand\\" (the second book in the series), the villain of \\"Prayers for Rain\\" is sinister, smug, brilliant, and sadistic, inflicting pain and death because he can.  Kenzie and Gennaro, in turn, want to stop him out of a sense of justice and vengeance.  The tension mounts as the detectives must struggle to protect their own loved ones and safety while finding a the key to bringing down an invisible and brilliant killer.      As with the rest of this series, Lehane explores the basic theme of power: who has it, why they want it, what they do to get it, and what they do when they have it.  At the beginning of each novel, the most powerful character is the villain.  They exercise their power violently, harming people because they can, and because their victims cannot fight back.  It falls to Kenzie and Gennaro to exact revenge, which is usually pretty gratifying, if problematic, since our society generally frowns on revenge.  Nonetheless, sometimes justice is not pretty, and it's understood that Kenzie and Gennaro are in the best position to fulfill that justice.    While \\"Prayers for Rain\\"is the last Kenzie/Gennaro book for the time being, Lehane has not written a \\"last\\" book in a series.  It would be easy for him to pick up this series if he so chose.  I hope he does,as I have enjoyed Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro's company for the past couple of years.  \\"Prayers for Rain\\" embodies much of what is great about this series and Lehane as a writer.  It's sharp, taut, intense, funny, and gripping.
0060763280|5.0|I look for one or two things out of a book such as this one to affect me.  This one had a huge ah ha for me.  I had never seen why my income always always always stays the same.  I saw clearly what was going on, why I am \\"programmed\\"  to make a certain amount of money.   <br /> <br />This gave me a lot of freedom to look at ways to make more money.   <br /> <br />I also saw how much I dislike wealthy people.  This is poison for my making more money.  <br /> <br />I am around wealthy people all the time, I enjoy their company much more.  Wealthy people are nice generous people.  I never would have admitted that before. <br /> <br />I have been involved in Landmark Education for years, the company that took off with The EST training, this book had many similarities with breaking from your past and seeing life as a \\"story\\".   <br /> <br />A very good read, I look forward to reading it again, with what I know now.
B0002EQ7E2|5.0|A lot of people have expressed surprise at this great Paul Simon album but I'm not sure why.  One of the reasons given by Paul as to why he broke up one of the more successful vocal duos ever was his intention to pursue a different musical direction, one that involved his great love for rhythm, and we get large doses of that on this album which incorporates not only African rhythmic styles but also Cajun folk rhythms.<br /><br />We get complex time signatures and constantly changing rhythms not only in the music but also in the acapella vocal stylings of \\"Diamonds On the Soles of Her Shoes\\" which is full of syncopated rhythms.  Fans of Paul are very familiar with his love for rhythm from earlier great tracks like the Grammy winning \\"Late in the Evening\\" which would have fit in well in this album as well.<br /><br />This version is also special as it comes in a digipak packaging and the sound quality has been remastered very, very well for a great sound.  The bonus tracks are an excellent plus as well, the demo version of \\"Homeless\\" the standout of the 3.  This is probably the best version of this album that is currently out there and is a must for all fans of great rhythmic music.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.

It has the sound and the fervor of a California drive or a California night during the time period.  The musical sections are beautifully put together and the singing is very good.  This album was something i had never even heard of before.  After i listened to it I decided to tell all my friends about it.  It has great grooves and even better atmosphere.  It is definately an album that is good for a long drive.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|A seminal masterpiece!  The first significant Hollywood movie to showcase a \\"real\\" love story between two men, demonstrating to the world that gays are humans too.  Not only a heartbreaking love story that spans human history. It is a story revealing our sadnesses on so many levels-from Ennis' chances at a relationship ruined by his father's  conviction that survival may be more important than love; to the hurt of so many women who are the victims of a gay man's need to \\"pass\\" in a world that will not accept the open existence of their meaningful love relationship.  Hauntingly beautiful scenery weaves brilliantly with Santaolla's cowboy country music, the music of indulgent heartaches, to permanently cast the story in melancholy memory.  Youthful actors Heath Ledger, Michele Williams and Jake Guyllenhall play out these roles with a genius recognized only in the most brilliant denizens of the silver screen.
B00006AW2G|4.0|I enjoy this album and as a whole it is a strong album.  You cant always get what you want is an all time favorite of mine and the rest of the tracks stand up and are very good.  Its a bit on the short side.  Overall if you like the stones this is the 3rd album of theirs you should get.  Exile on Main Street and Sticky Fingers are better overall.  Exile on Main Street is one of the best albums of all time in fact.  SO after that, buy this!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was intelligent, funny, original, and unique.  The characters had individuality and depth, and were very well acted.  The people who cast this show were either geniuses or very lucky, since I can't imagine a better choice for eight of the nine main characters, and the ninth was quite good as well.<br /><br />My brother bought me the DVD box set for Christmas, and in the next two months I watched every episode at least three times, and most of them more.  The only bad thing about Firefly is that it only lasted half a season, and every time I watch an episode I end up mad at Fox for prematurely terminating a show that had more potential than any other series I have ever seen.<br /><br />This is what television should be.

6304708521|2.0|MMT has long been one of my favorite Beatles' albums, and I was expecting this movie to be just as good.  After all, even though it originally bombed, a lot of other films which are now considered classics also did very poor business and got scathing reviews when they were first released.  Part of the reason why it originally got such horrid reviews was that it was shown in black and white, even though it had been shot in color and was really meant to be seen in color, like for some of the musical sequences.  You wouldn't get the full impact in black and white.  Just like there are some movies you can't picture being in anything but black and white, there are some movies that only belong in color.  This is one of them.  And it was also aired on Boxing Day, which wasn't the ideal day for most British people to be watching movies on television.  But even now that we can watch it at a more opportune time and see it in its original color, I still agree with the critics who originally lambasted it.  This really was a big ego trip for Paul.  He used to be my favorite Beatle, and he really does seem like a nice guy, but only a die-hard sycophant would deny that he does often come across as being a bit of an egotist and perfectionist, and trying to rewrite Beatles' history so that he comes across as the band's savior and the leading creative force, like when he once claimed that he, not John, was really the avant-garde one.  Writing a few songs like \\"Helter Skelter\\" and \\"Fixing a Hole\\" doesn't change the fact that many more of his songs were ballads and lightweight cheesy fluff (not that there's anything wrong with that type of music in moderation).<br /><br />Anyway, this movie is nothing like YS, AHDN, or 'Help!'  It lacks their wit, humor, and fun.  Even most of the musical performances aren't as great as the ones in their other movies, despite the fact that we're talking about 6 really good songs here.  There doesn't even seem to be any plot to it at all.  The concept that was so common in England at the time, getting on a bus and taking a day trip to nowhere, might have played out better had there actually been some substance to this film.  Basically all we see are some musical performances, some dream sequences, a few scenes of The Beatles dressed up as wizards in a laboratory, Ringo fighting with his Aunt Jessie, and the tourists doing not much of anything exciting.  I normally love surrealism, psychedelia, and all things avant-garde, but this movie just didn't do it for me.  There were some nice avant-garde and surreal scenes, like the \\"Flying\\" sequence, but they were overwhelmed by the lack of a plot and substance.  This is even worse than a bad home movie, although since The Beatles are in it, it can't be completely dreadful.  If you want to see a psychedelic, surreal, avant-garde, drug-influenced movie from this era, see something like 'Yellow Submarine' or 'Head.'  Those movies might be really weird too, but at least they have substance and plots, and inspired imagery and themes.that was so common in England at the time, getting on a bus and taking a day trip to nowhere, might have played out better had there actually been some substance to this film.

0684824906|5.0|the publication of this wonderful book with george bush in the white house is most telling, since the contrast in management styles are so diametrically opposite in these 2 republican presidants.  while bush professes admiration for lincoln, he certainly has not tried to learn from him.   that lincoln would have drawn his most determined adversaries into his cabinet, and in the process, converted them to devoted followers and friends is in such sharp contrast to our current president, who has stacked the cabinet and the white house with sycophants and blind followers.  where dissent and debate were the hallmarks of lincoln's presidency, abject conformance marks our present government.  lincoln avoided serious mistake because he got independent advice and counsel from the strongest politicians of his time.  bush has stumbled into one crisis after another because he has not had advice from independent thinkers.  in addition to illuminating the workings of the lincoln cabinet, this well-written book provides much insight into the personality of our greatest president and the turmoil which affected his public and private lives.  that this book is so well written is no surprise given the known literary talents of the author, and i found it difficult to put the book down, so compelling was the narative.  highly recommended reading.

0802130208|5.0|The first time I read this book I laughed so hard that I had tears coming out of my eyes and was snorting.  This was awful as I was on the train from NY to Boston and while I should have been embarassed and put the book down, I remember thinking that I had become Ignatius J. Reilly himself; I really didn't care what anyone thought.  Besides, the book was so fantastic, I couldn't put it down.    Fifteen years later I re-read the book for my bookclub and was so surprised to find that it just wasn't AS funny as I remembered; the depressing angles of the story stood out more that time around.  I also had the high expectations of humor I had placed on the book to contend with.  Maybe it was that I had a mortgage and four kids and was not prone to snorting in laughter on trains anymore(....that, on it's own, was a little sad.)    Well, here I am, four years further along and I have read it again and I am back to crying with laughter.  Ignatius is one of the most memorable characters you will ever take away from a novel.  He is lazy and clumsy, inept and a snob of sorts. The descriptions of him with that awful green hat and his damp mustache, his \\"valve\\" problems and his sloth-like behavior will leave you howling.      Ignatius leaves such an impression on you that you will start \\"seeing\\" him places.  He IS that odd guy who's always at the bagel shop...he's the one you cross the street to avoid when you are with your children...maybe he's that guy snorting in laughter in the corner of the train.    This should be on everyone's summer reading list.

6304806418|5.0|Well, most of what is to say about this movie has already been said. Madonna does shine in this movie (in fact I would argue that theatre is much more her strong suit than music alone). You can tell that she went to school to perform in the arts more so here then in anything else I have seen her in, as the dancing, movement, and passion by which she presents Eva Peron is quite moving. <br /> <br />I think its important to keep in mind when comparing this movie, it is more relevant to compare it to other works by Tim Rice/Andrew Lloyd Webber then it is to reality. This play was written back in the mid to late 70's, about 20 years after her death. It was not like today where you could simply Google a plethora of information on someone...so what is present in the play is knowledge based more on folklore and media present at that time than it is on fact (not to mention the overthrow and exile of the Peron regime itself from Argentina until the early 70's). This also beacons the question of can we truly know the full truth about those who are idolized in such a way as Eva Peron is. <br /> <br /> There are some very clever present in the play-on-words in this movie, as is in all Andrew Lloyd Webber plays (the reference to Buenos Aires as \\"BA, Big Apple\\", as both New York and Argentina have a Broadway district, both having around the same population and art/dance focus). Also, the only reference to what actually killed Eva Peron is mentioned in only 1 line in the play (this is because at the time, only people very close to her knew what was happening, as the rest of Argentina could only see her getting physically weaker). In the movie, it shows a lot of the lower class people working in slaughter houses, as at the time Argentina was the world leader in beef exportation, as Europe was still war torn and was importing a large amount of it beef (this is what really had a lot to do with the political changes at the time, as the economy for Argentina as a result was booming). All of these little nuances are what make Andrew Lloyd Webber movies so loved and timeless (and some would argue overly so). <br /> <br />So while its true that you won't get scads of historical knowledge out of watching this movie, you will get a general idea of the political and social structure of Argentina during this time period.  More importantly, it gives you a glimpse into how social climbing was not so easy, especially for women in those days. It's all about how 1 woman in just the few years she was in power shaped the political and social playing field for years to come. The music in this movie is incredible (and will get stuck in your head).  <br /> <br />If your truly interested in finding out more on the life (and death) of Eva Peron, I recommend some of the more popular books on her life (Amazon has several), as well as \\"Santa Evita\\", which loosely chronicles the very bizarre escapades of her body after she died. A must see for play lovers. <br />
B000028U0Y|5.0|First, I would tag myself as a new fan of Johnny Cash via Walk the Line. But stangely enough, I can separate my feelings for the movie from Johnny Cash the man.  But the movie whet my interest and since then I've invested a lot of money and time in Cash CDs and books.  I'm very intrigued by the man and his music. <br />Folsom is a reminder of what Cash was-an Everyman who was not afraid to get his hands dirty and truly had compassion for the less fortunate in the world.  He \\"clicked\\" with many in his audience and indeed has \\"clicked\\" with many others all over the world. <br />Cash is a poet and a storyteller in his music, whether it's \\"25 Minutes To Go\\", \\"Cocaine Blues\\" or \\"I Still Miss Someone\\"- and like a poet he will pull at your heartstrings, while at the same time making you want to smile....
B000E8QVWY|3.0|I was really looking forward to this movie, but it was really focused way too much on Cash's pursuit of June Carter.  What I really was expecting was more about Johnny's music career and more about his life in general.  The movie basically ends around 1970, no mention at all of Johnny and June's life after that. <br /> <br />I think Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Cash was very good.  I had reservations about his singing at first, but I guess he was portraying Johnny in his early days as not having as strong of a voice. <br /> <br />Reese Witherspoon was her usual adorable self, but I don't think she pulled off June Carter that well.  She really didn't look or sound that much like June.  I will say that Witherspoon has an excellent singing voice (I would almost expect her to release an album), it just isn't June's unique voice. <br /> <br />Overall this is a decent movie, but it really mainly focused on the Cash/Carter relationship over a relatively short timespan. <br /> <br />
B00005214X|5.0|When the Beatles broke up all the fans knew that John Lennon and Paul McCartney would release good albuns. However, the first one of the four to present the fans with a nice albun was George Harrison and probably one of the best among all of the work done by John, Paul or George. He wrote \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" for the Abbey Road albun, two great songs remind us that not only Lennon and McCartney could write beautiful songs. <br />All Things Must Pass is not only a great albun it is also a sweet way to remember a great romantic composer.
B0000028M7|5.0|This album is so great and so emotional it could make you cry. There's lots of stuff about it being depressing but i don't feel that when i listen to it but i see what you all mean, i think its dark, sad and emotional but i don't feel depressed when i listen to it. Junkheads a very underrated song and probably my favourite but then again there aren't really any stand outs on here its all pure greatness. The playing on this album is great and Layne Staley has a voice up there with Chris Cornell but the one tiny thing on this album that doesn't stand out as godlike are the lyrics, the lyrics have a powerful message and are delivered greatly but the way they are written is very basic and at times cheesy e.g \\"whats gone wrong, i can't see straight, been too long, so full of hate\\" - hate to feel, at times they are good though particularly on rooster and the way Layne sings them you don't even notice. That aside you can't beat this album and anyone who doesn't own it should.
0140131558|3.0|If you like a conundrum with no clear answers, you might like this book. I found it well-written, but not the type of novel I generally enjoy reading: gauzy, strange, nonsensical in places. The third in the trilogy is by far the best, in my opinion, so if you're tempted to give up, hang in there.
B000002LRX|5.0|Next to alice in chains dirt this is probably my favourite album ever and Patton plays a huge part in making it great. Mike Patton is one of if not the best frontmen of all time and this is the first time his genius really shows in faith no more. Faith no mores first album the real thing was a funk metal commercial piece of garbage i thought personally and this album and the following two are what made faith no more one of the best bands ever. Alot of \\"fans\\" who liked the real thng might not like this album or the following two but they can go to hell because this album right here is faith no more and mike patton at their very best. The best tracks are kindergarten, land of sunshine, midlife crisis and jizzlobber but they are all great in their own way.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Well, I'm neither a feminist nor an S&M fan.  I loved this film.  S&M is the frame for a story full of hesitation, emotional pain, and longing.  Not only for Lee, but for the heartbreakingly tragic Mr. Grey. The film allows each of them to grow and to risk love; to allow for pleasure that isn't entirely about pain by the end of the story.  It's also funny without being silly.  I spent part of the film flinching, part laughing, and part being turned on. The characters are three-dimensional and empathetic towards each other, in strange but moving ways.  Well done, but too sexual for the timid and too much plot and character for those who like porn.
B000002GK1|5.0|Soundgarden are my favourite band but i can never decide what my favourite soundgarden album is it really just depends on my mood but to non soundgarden lovers it probably depends more on your taste in music because each of soundgardens albums are very different. If you like heavy dirty grunge you'll like this album, for something cleaner and more arty superunknown, for something more 80's ultramega OK or louder than love and for a summer psychedelic feel get down on the upside. Every soundgarden album is great so get them all because you can't judge them on one album.

B000003TA4|5.0|I'm giving this five stars just because i'm sick of spandex wearing, teased hair having 80's glam \\"rockers\\" and self proclaimed metalheads crying about how nirvana ruined metal. Nirvana didn't ruin metal and kurt didn't ruin guitar nirvana brought back music guys can listen to as apposed to bon jovi or poison or whatever other bands you's are still crying about losing. Also there are still plenty of good guitar players these days they just play heavier better music. Nirvana aren't a great band but they're not bad either and this is not their best album (that being in utero) but its not that bad either (or that good). Nirvana are overrated but can everyone please stop with the \\"i hate nirvana they suck\\" because its really getting old. And finally to \\"mr. punkrocker\\" i would just like to say your even worse then the glam rockers and metalheads you bag nirvana and then mention three completely overrated punk bands atleast make it interesting and say some bands like circle jerk or the subhumans or something, nirvana aren't a punk band but there still more punk then you buddy.
0451191153|4.0|Ok, there's a lot that can be said about this book. But I'm only going to give the ups and downs up Rand's Fountainhead. <br /> <br />Ups: <br />I was hooked on the story. Howard Roark is a admirable character and I just loved the way he was portrayed. The same can be said about the other characters. I really enjoyed the first quarter and the second half of the book.  <br /> <br />Also, I don't understand the 'still' dialogue. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. I think the dialogue is quite good, but unbelievable at times. <br /> <br />Downs: <br />The whole objectivism thing is too radical. While I love the pro-individualist part, I can't get past Rand's elitist attitude. Dominique Francon, while she doesn't ruin the story, is so unbelievable at parts. I mean, the whole \\"I go to work only beceuase it amuses me. Muahahah\\" nonsense is rediculous. It isn't possible to act so cold. Ok, enough rambling. <br /> <br /> The only REAL bore in the book is the middle, which focuses on Ellesworth M. Toohey and Dominque a great deal. Once you're past this, the novel picks up its great pace again. <br /> <br />If you're into the whole philosophy thing, or if you think that you're better than everyone else, buy this book. But for those who just want a good story, buy the book as well.
B00000JG41|5.0|This is Mr. Bungles best album by far, there are weird songs like none of them knew they were robots and the stand out track goodbye sober day, beautiful songs like retrovertigo and then everything else is just everywhere which makes this album mind blowing. Vanity fair is probably the second best track on the album and really shows how great Mikes voice is as do retrovertigo and pink cigarette. An easier listen then other Bungle albums but still very weird and very cool.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Cinderella is the most popular fairy tale of all time.  There are several versions of the story that we might have all read at different points as children.  This had \\"chick flick\\" written all over it, but I was pleased with the results as they fleshed out this tale as best as they could. <br /> <br />Drew Barrymore, the world's most successful comeback child star, plays Danielle, a young peasant girl in France.  Like the fairy tale, her father remarries, gains a family of a step mother and two step sisters, then suddenly dies.  Danielle is left with her new family but finds the true nature of her step mother to be cold and cruel (played wonderfully by Angelica Houston).  Her bitter jealousy of Danielle's good qualities and contempt is obvious.  What the fairy tale versions did not always hint at (with the possible exception of the Disney animated movie) was that the step mother is plotting for her own daughter to be in favor with the royal court and marry the prince.  It makes for many hilarious situations with Danielle and her step mother and sister (see that scene when she knocks her over and her feet go flying over her head).  Her younger step sister, while the weaker and clearly not the favorite of the two, makes for Danielle's unlikely ally.   <br /> <br />While Danielle tries to keep the peace and home and make the best of her situation, the prince of France one day comes right to her door.  Prince Henry is suffering from a combination of cold feet and growing pains, and when a willful Danielle comes into the picture he is taken aback.  While at first there is animosity between them, but the love will naturally grow.  They incorporate some more modern themes in this story that your average so-and-so in those times might not have been thinking of (education, free thinking, justice system, etc.) because a vast majority were illiterate.  Plus, Danielle is strong enough that she doesn't need the prince to come rescue her from the evil neighbor who bought her.  She slays the dragon herself and has a humbled prince come before her asking her to take him back.  And her fairy godmother is none other than Leonardo DiVinci himself. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful take on the most beloved of all fairy tales and leaves wonders to the imagination.
0307276902|3.0|After being rejeted by many publishers, J.Frey decided to call this story a factual recount of his experience.  Well, we all know what happened next.  If you can get beyond his discussions of truth and honesty and the idea that any \\"facts\\" in this piece are either not true or questionable, then you'll might just enjoy the story.  It is poetic at times in the way that he gets into the mind of an addict.  It's an enjoyable FICTIONAL ride.  How important is truth when you are a drug addict?
B0000A118M|1.0|I have to disagree with the majority of folks here who consider this cd the jazz end all. I find it grating, and darn near unlistenable. I have built a small but quality jazz library the last few months. Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Kenny Burrell, Grant Green, Cannonball Adderley, Stan Getz, Chet Baker, Wes Montgomery, Bill Evans and Thelonius Monk to name a few. This guy is by far my least favorite. His playing on Miles Davis cd's I have and with Monk is largely enjoyable and I know he's a giant. But this stuff?. The live recording on disc two was so grating I couldn't make it through. It sounded to me like a bunch of Geese being slaughtered. Give me the other guys anytime.

0671015206|4.0|The basic principle of wealth is to generate cash flow from assets.  The Millionaire Next Door reveals that true wealth comes from owning a business that generates significant cash flow.  It is very difficult to become wealthy while working for a paycheck because you can only work so many hours per day.  The wealthy save and invest their money and leverage the time, talent and expertise of others through a business entity. The majority of Millionaires are very disciplined and have a high level of self confidence.  These traits keep them from buying non-wealth producing items such as cars, jewelry, and furniture to impress others.

B000063UR2|5.0|This was a gift for my fiancee on his birthday.  As a child he had watched this movie and was in love with it since then.  But for the past year this has been a difficult CD to find.  And when I did find it from another vendor it was expensive.  I was so grateful to find that not only did amazon.com have the special edition dvd but it was also much cheaper to buy from them than other vendors.  I thank amazon for making it possible for me to find this DVD and get it in time for his birthday with their next day delivery that came NEXT DAY.  This is one reason why I began shopping with Amazon, and I will continue to shop with them for future purchases.
B000000W5L|5.0|I didn't own this on vinyl so my first exposure to Exile was on cd.  My immediate impression was, 'this is in serious need of remastering'.  Mick's vocals were all wrong - mixed so far down that it was hard to understand him.  The whole thing sounded like a murky mess.  'What a shame', I thought.  These songs seem like they'd be good if they didn't sound like they were all record in someone's basement.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />Exile was never intended to be a sonic masterpiece.  Sometimes a song is great if it sounds like it was recorded in someone's basement.
B000003TAR|5.0|This is one the best Nirvana albums of all time.  Heart shaped box and all apologies are pure classics.  Penroyal tea and Rape me aren't too shabby either.  Do yourselfe a favor and order this album, you won't regret it.
B00065VTU4|5.0|I put this off for a long time because I always heard during these sessions Clapton wanted to move away from the guitar 'God' image. I knew the hits and liked them but didn't think the overall vibe would be that great.  Well, I was wrong.  This deluxe set shows EC working through some nice gutiar parts.  He starts off the first song (Motherless Children) creating a little guitar havoc with some electric slide.  Then he moves over to slide on a dobro guitar.  In fact, there is plenty of slide guitar all over these tracks.  Since this was recorded not too terribly long after Clapton's comeback from herion addiction I wasn't sure if it EC playing but I checked the notes and sure enough it's him.  This is a true guitar treasure with great songs.  No, it isn't anything he did with Cream and it doesn't have the wall of guitar sound he and Duane laid down on Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs but 461 Ocean Blvd rocks nicely.<br />The expanded tracks on disc 1 are all good.<br /><br />The live disc is a real treat.  Eric seems grateful to be back and playing in front of a hometown audience.<br /><br />And to think it had not been that long ago Clapton was having herion delivered to his door so he wouldn't have to ever leave his house.  The real difference maker is in the photos on the cover of this disc and in the notes.  Compare them to Clapton on the cover of the Rainbow concert album (when he was still a user).  They look like the photos of two different people.  Needless to say he's looking healthy during the 461 sessions.<br /><br />True, there are 3 tracks that can be found on the Crossroads 2 box set.  But that should not be enough to keep the true fan away.  And if you're a casual fan who will never buy the box set then this double cd is a perfect purchase.
B000E6UK5K|2.0|Like many David Gilmour fans, I bought this CD with great expectations.  I listened to it through twice in the hope that I'd missed something, but I fear that I didn't.  The voice is still like honey, and the guitar work remains exceptional.  But the whole album is like a whisper . . . hypnotic and soothing . . . with neither a wail nor a roar.  No one can begrudge David if this is where he is in life.  But part of what made his whispers in the past so powerful was the thunder that often preceded and followed them.  And on \\"On An Island\\" there's not a cloud in the sky.
B00004Y6OA|4.0|I kind of forgot about this album for a long time.  Last year I went on a Van Halen buying rampage and bought most of their collection on cd from amazon.  Glad I included this one.<br /><br />Van Halen released Women and Children First as a follow up to their first 2 studios albums.  There isn't much for the top 40 crowd to get very excited about.  'And The Cradle Will Rock' comes the closest to being a hit single.  It's a great song, marking the first time Eddie moved over to keyboards in the studio.  Actually, it's a Hammond organ and adds a ton of atmosphere to the song.<br /><br />For the rest of the album the tried and true formula of letting Eddie go crazy on his guitar always works and when that happens here the results are predictably good.<br /><br />Not an essential purchase until you get VH 1, 2, and 1984.

B000B2YQX4|5.0|I review music on its individual strengths and weakness and not moronic comparisons to Violator or other DM records of the past. The bottom line is, as a body of work, this record features superb songwriting, arrangements and synthesizer programming.  The music is simply that good. A previous reviewer cited the ending of Sinner In Me as an example of incredible synthesizer production.  He's right.  My mind was blown. <br /> <br />If PTA was Depeche Mode's debut record, then most you whiney boneheads wouldn't have Violator to compare it to (gasp!) and would actually have to review it on its own merits.  What a concept!
0385513755|3.0|Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code is a standard thriller, well written, but blasphemous to many readers.  It uses as its premise the bogus theory that Jesus Christ married Mary Magdalene and had children with her.  Further the book alleges that Mary was in fact the Holy Grail, and that the Catholic Church was covering up this marriage (and children) for thousands of years.  The book makes numerous such assertions to support this premise, too many to name here.  Many readers are deeply offended by this, others are delighted.  But this controversy is why the book is a best seller.<br /><br />A few thoughts.  Brown uses the Catholic Church as one of his villains and this is a common, politically correct technique in today's hypersensitive world (Catholicism is one of the few \\"acceptable\\" villains now). Brown also mischaracterizes basic tenets of the Christian faith to support his alternative history.  But Brown does tie his plot threads together nicely in the end, and his imagery does an excellent job in putting the reader in Paris and other locales.  He is an excellent craftsman of words.<br /><br />If you can swallow the basic premise, the adventure is interesting and contains surprises and romance to satisfy most readers.  All things considered it is a good read.
B000BISBDY|5.0|Especially when they keep releasing these amazing cd's filled with this mans guts and glory. Johnny Cash on top of having a successful  in his honor, is blessed with a greatest hits cd worthy of any fan new or old alike. Folsom Prison Blues remains my favorite song but after hearing some of his best track after track you begin to think everyone is your favorite. One of the best things about this is that it all fits on one cd, so no more scrambling between 2 or 3 to find your favorites, as its all in one place. Just a great, great cd definately recommend everyone checking it out.
0307276902|4.0|I was totally overwhelmed by the story, wanted all my children and grandchildren to read it ( I am a recovered or recovering?? alcoholic) I felt it was kinda unbelievable, some of the situations and so harrowing!!!! I also drank at a young age and had bad experiences and went into AA at the age of 22, but never anything like Frey. (I later went back out) I now have 35 years of sobriety, I reasoned that it was worse for Frey because of the drug addiction involved,but I know that most young people today if addicted have a dual problem. I sent the book to my daughter and her children because these things do run in families,genetics etc. I was sorry to hear that Frey had exagerrated his experiences in order to get published.Although I had found them hard to believe and in a sense I was relieved to find out that he hadn't really suffered that much, he was so young. Even so it was a riveting tale and one that would have been a best seller as a novel anyway. I think he has more stories to tell and should be allowed to tell them. I will certainly buy anything else he gets a chance to write. I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact I thought it was all true.

B000E5N62U|4.0|As a listener of 'Steely Dan' and Donald Fagen, 'Morph the Cat' is like a comfortable pair of jeans -- it's an album that is instantly listenable.<br /><br />And while comfortable and familiar, with the signature crisp drums and bassline riffs, plus beyond-tight vocal harmonies, and the Pointer Sister-like backups, this ain't no rehash of other efforts.<br /><br />Sure, it sounds like 'Steely Dan' -- thank goodness -- but 'Morph the Cat' is fresh, interesting, and great to listen to.
B000E5N62U|5.0|When a Donald or Dan album is released it's event worthy of a tick on some kind of celestial sun dial and never a question of if to buy but when.  The nicer your hardware the more atmospherically engaging the experience is still holds true.  Sounds great on these tin can imac speakers.<br /><br />Morph seems to be technically similar to Everything Must Go with each lyrical lick and wandering harmonica intrusions.  Should these be compared to the Nightfly or Kamakiriad?  Trilogy?  If so this is the first one I wasn't grabbed in the first play thru.  But for as long as I've listened to Donald Fagan I know that the very best songs like Dr. Wu take some getting used to.  The inarguable genius method of the first track instills chaos at first but after the third play sound starts to sound familiarly natural.  Starts off with an atmosphere reminiscent of True Companion up until the introspective What I do.  Brite Nitegown picks it all back up.  Great Pagoda and Mona seem to draw from Negative Girl.  Security has Cousin Dupree wrapped all around it, beautiful.  Not sure why Garden door trails on and on like a repeating regret from missing your turn exit but it hauntingly works.

0913866156|4.0|Conceptualized by Aleister Crowley and illustrated by Lady Frieda Harris, Aleister Crowley's 'Thoth' Tarot deck is a wonderful example of the revival of Art Nouveau style that came out of the WPA era. The colors of this particular edition of the Thoth deck seem a little more subdued and earthy than earlier editions, but it is still pleasing to the eye.<br /><br />  Many of the human figures have a great sense of drama and movement to them and much of the background imagery is both organic and industrial, giving the deck a very modern feel. Quite a few of the cards seem like stained glass windows, like 'Adjustment' - Crowley's version of 'Justice'. My personal favorite is the 'Queen of Disks', featuring a woman wearing a horned hat, with a small ram looking questioningly from the corner of the card.<br /><br />  The minor arcana are fairly standard, with simple depictions of cups, swords, discs and wands. Each one is different, but it's still easy to say, \\"Oh, that's the three of wands!\\" People who find imagery of pentagrams disturbing may find relief in the Thoth deck as the discs have Hebrew characters or other small symbols on them instead of the familiar five-pointed star.<br /><br />  For someone new to Tarot, or someone more familiar to the Rider-Waite standards of Tarot design, some of the names of the major arcana might be confusing, and the Golden Dawn decks reverse the positions of the 'Justice' (called 'Adjustment') and 'Strength' (called 'Lust') cards. I personally have trouble with wands being associated with fire and swords being associated with air - to me, it should be the other way around, so that's how I read the cards. The one other thing I don't like about any of the 'Thoth' decks I've had over the years is the size of the cards themselves. I have petite hands, and the Thoth deck is wider than most cards I've used, so it's hard to handle and shuffle the deck. The card size is only advantageous to the artwork - the larger landscapes mean more to see.ee.

Pool Hall Richard. <br /> <br />Listening to The Faces on this compilation, years later in mid-life, makes me realise just how good these guys really were.  Their boozy reckless bawdy image is at odds with the quality of their writing and playing.  Cindy Incidentally & Pool Hall Richard are gems.  And the tracks included from the early \\"Small Faces\\" album (Rod & Ronnie Wood version), which I'd never heard before, were a revelation to me. <br /> <br />For a time there in the early 70's Rod & The Faces were worthy contenders for the title of greatest rock 'n' roll band in the world.  It's embarrassing to see Rod churning out that rubbish today (surely he's already got enough money).  And whilst Ronnie has been clocking-on at the Stones for over 30 years (and looks like them!), to me he did his best work in The Faces with his own sound & co-writing. <br /> <br />

B000AA305M|4.0|an epic work of grandeur by the consummate performer who sings circles around most of the others. There is strong songwriting and expert playing by all the musicians involved.<br /><br />As for this ridiculous \\"copy-protection\\" scheme, couldn't the record company have come up with a better solution that offers more value to the consumer and less restriction over their ability to enjoy the product they have purchased?
B0001BS4Q0|1.0|There is only one good song on this entire album, and that was Breathe Me. <br /> <br />And whoever told this woman that she could sing should maybe be shot. <br /> <br />Her voice is breathy, whiny and overall pretty annoying. I'm a little offended they compared her to such great artists as Fiona Apple and Imogen Heap. <br /> <br />

B000E5N62U|5.0|6:00 AM (EST) I ran to the local Walmart to purchase a copy of Fagan's newest masterpiece, only to be dissapointed by the store's lack of logistic sense. They hadn't shelved their new release albums yet! I was upset, but not without hope. I decided to buy the album at Best Buy during my lunch hour. Any how, I bought the disc (which had already been marked down to $11) popped it into my truck's cd player, and that was it. I was hooked. To sum it into words; mix \\"Kamakiriad\\" with \\"2 Against Nature,\\" throw in some \\"Everything Must Go\\", and a dash of \\"Gaucho\\" (especially in \\"Mary Shut the Garden Door\\"). I must emphasize this album's connections with Gaucho specifically, as the rhythms are quite similar in the sense that they are slow, depressing, mysterious, yet still catchy. The lyrics bring you back to the darker side of human life; suicide, gangs, a mysterious cat that consumes people. The refined lyrics and smooth composition connect it to 'Dan's last two albums. Steely Dan and their respective solo spinoffs seem to get better as the years go by. I look at this album as another chapter in the crazy stories of hapless (hopefully fictional) characters that line the pages of Fagan's vast book of stories.
0060751967|4.0|Loved the beginning and middle.  I found it funny and full of action.  Strange and different take on the vampire. I mean, who ever heard of a vampire--once upon a time monk?  The scene with the sex doll was hilarious (especially when they were moving it around--like into the trunk).<br /><br />I found the very end to become a bit contrite.  I thought it could have been pulled together better than it was.  Otherwise, great read and an looking forward to more.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I do not really even like country music but i always liked Johnny Cash. His style and way he did it just always stood out. You really have to give him credit for giving his all and even making this album in the first place especially in such poor health. I saw the video for Hurt one night and kept thinking about it it was stuck in my head I decided to look on this site to see if the whole album was as good. The next day I bought it and I am not the least bit disapointed You can just tell his sincerity. When you think about the fact that he died shortly after it really makes you think. Of course he doesnt have sound like he did when he was young but for a man over 70 he sounds very good. This is an album that anybody can appreciate even if you dont like the music and i think everybody should listen to it sometime because its just that good. I would rather listen to something like this than someone who has a beautiful voice but no real love for their music I think he knew he was going to die soon when he made this. Do yourself a favor and listen to this album and this is coming from a huge rap fan/artist  <br /> <br />R.I.P. <br /> <br />John R. Cash  <br /> <br />Everyone you know comes back in the very end
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|it is a truth universally acknowledged ... that no other film adaptation can ever measure up to the 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, at least according to austen purists.  and i agree. <br /> <br />therefore, i will not attempt to compare this film to its predecessors but rather just review it on its own merits. <br /> <br />i like this new adaptation.  it is quite a different take of the novel.  it is a grittier rural england that gives the story a bit more realism.  unlike other period adaptations that tend to be very picturesque and clean depicting a very ideal world, the setting, particularly of the bennet household, gives it a more genuine feel.  <br /> <br />keira's lizzie & matthew's darcy have such a wicked chemistry when they're together, that alone is worth buying the DVD.  knightley's performance is a bit stilted in some scenes but overall, she conveyed a delightfully strong-willed and witty lizzie.  macfadyen, who had very big shoes to fill, i think did a good job with the material he was given.  he brought a vulnerability to darcy, played quite well by macfadyen ... man, that voice ...  mr. collins, who was always one of my favorite characters, was delightful. <br /> <br />a lot of liberty was taken transforming lizzie's character from a very open character throughout the novel to one of an open but gradually secretive character in the movie.  but still, it is consistent with the particular flavor of this adaptation.  <br /> <br />the film certainly lost a lot of the witty dialogues that made the novel the literary work of art that it is.  however, there was enough to still carry the movie through. <br /> <br />i would have loved to see more scenes that showed darcy becoming more attracted to lizzie and vice versa, but i suppose it was effectively maneuvered & compensated by the two actors by making the viewer feel that whenever they were together, they seem to be only aware of each other. <br /> <br />one of my disappointments is mr. bingley's character.  i thought mr. bingley could've been portrayed better.  same goes for mr. wickham's character.  although rupert friend's acting was barely tolerable, so i suppose i should be thankful that i was not forced to see more of it.  also, the two youngest girls annoyingly overdid their giggles, most likely due to the fact that they had nothing much to say throughout the entire film. <br /> <br />all in all this is a delightful movie.  i watched it expecting to be disappointed but was pleasantly surprised that i liked it.  i may yet watch it again. <br />
B000E6UK5K|4.0|We need to keep in mind we are reviewing an album NOT David or Nick or Roger or Pink Floyd. So lets keep to that. I think this is a great effort and it shows David has put in a lot of thought and soul into this album. The songs are mellow and have a rather fresh rhythm to them. A welcome effort and a great one. Of course we should not be comparing this to a Pink Floyd album but reviewing it in the correct context i.e David's solo effort. Give the man the credit and sit back and enjoy some fine music.
B0000714BP|5.0|This is one of my favorite comedies of all time!  It has a great soundtrack also!
B00003CXBH|5.0|Read the other 4 & 5-star reviews... this movie is flawless.  It grapples with some of the greatest and most difficult questions of religion, spirituality, and humanity.  The cast is ridiculously awesome.  Jeremy Irons' character is a great role model for anyone who considers themselves a learner in the life-long process of becoming more like Christ.

076113719X|5.0|I Love this calendar!  Between my husband, myself and our three kids, there is room for everyone.  It is great for keeping track of all our separate events, who's got what going on which day.  I had another 'mom' calendar before but it was set up to where you had to enter all the names in every week.  With this one, I just fill our names in at the beginning of every month and I'm done.  I was disappointed when I couldn't find it in stores, but so happy when I ordered it on Amazon.  I have had this same calendar for several years running.  If I could, I would just sign up so that a new one would automatically be sent to my house at the beginning of every year.
B00005Q66T|2.0|I was disappointed - I was looking for dance music.  The Confessions on a Dance floor that also purchased was much more useful overall and I think better.  Madonna is reasonably well produced, puts a lot of energy into her work but it is not A work - somewhere between C/B with a few songs B+/A- - Hung Up is actually pretty decent and the single has some interesting re-mixes.

0312330537|5.0|I loved this book and was swept away by the main character, Linbaba.  I appreciate the expanse of a life well-lived and this story points to such a life through vivid images and wonderfully fluid prose--with many instances that leapt from the page and touched my heart and mind.  I was sad when the book ended and so enamored of the story and the use of words, that I immediately read it again--this time highlighting those passages that truly touched me.  It's a keeper and one that I would not hesitate to highly recommend.
B000002U82|5.0|The dark side of the moon ranks in the top five albums of all time after SGT PEPPERS from the Beatles.This fantastic album contains super songs like money,us and them and eclipse.You got to get this in your collection.Five stars.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|\\"Serenity\\" takes everything wonderful about \\"Firefly\\"-- the complexity, humor, excitement, and characters that feel like family members-- and pushes it all to another level. This is an incredibly intense, downright scary film. The quality of writing and acting is beyond belief, and the special effects, while not really central to the film, are consistently great. Familiarity with the backstory from the show will make your experience with the movie even deeper and more shocking, but even on its own \\"Serenity\\" stands as the equal of any adventure movie ever made. Five stars is not enough to describe the astonishing feat that is \\"Serenity.\\"
B000002J09|5.0|Led zeppelin's Zoso or fourth album is the greatest heavy metal album ever along with Machinehead from Deep purple.this classic album contains masterpieces like Black dog,Rock and roll and When the leevee breaks.Highly recommended.Ignore the haters and the naysayers.Buy this.Led zep rock!!!!!!!.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I actually heard about the film serenity through my cousin. First I thought - western, sci/fi - oh my god <br />But when I saw it I understood why this film has 8 out of 10 stars at [...] - Its fantastic .... <br />So the next step was to see the whole series - which took me about 3 days. This is such a wonderful series ... I think everybody who likes sci/fi should see it. <br />In other words this show has brilliant characters, a perfect theme song, a totally different view of the universe and these facts make the series unique. <br />
B0001WTWCO|5.0|I absolutely love this beautiful film.  I saw it many years ago and was too young to really appreciate everything it has going for it I guess.  So, if you happen to be one of those who have not watched this since the first time, or one of those who seem to have such negative feelings about it, please do yourself a favor and rewatch this.  If you have never watched it, DO SO NOW. No one can really miss what a beautiful film this is, can they?  I have read every  review here because even that brings back so much of the intense beauty of this film.  This cast could not have been better chosen.  Everyone seems like the \\"real character\\" and of course Fiennes is always great.  It never even occurred to me to find anything offensive about the fact that, especially during a war, people had affairs.  This is just plain truth.  However, maybe the real problem with those who find this offensive is that you find yourself wanting this couple to have it all.  You don't care that this affair is illicit. You understand the affair. You want these lovers to be able to be together.  This couple should be together. (She's married to a man who is so emotionally frail he would rather see her dead than allow her to be happy with another man.  So this marriage was in trouble anyway.)  But this film is about far more than just this affair.  The use of the flashback telling of this tale makes you painfully aware of what a beautiful, vibrant man the patient was and then the wreckage he became. There is so much pain and suffering involved in all this.  At times it is hard to watch....you feel so desperate for these people.  Even so, this is one of the greatest tragic romances in film, I think. I watch this  over and over in any given year.  Don't take anybody's word for it....watch it for your own benefit.  You won't be sorry if you do.
B000002UAX|5.0|I bought this for my fiance and he really loves it.  Couldn't find this anywhere else but at Amazon.
B00003CXA4|5.0|I lived in India for two years in the early 60's and can confirm the atmospheric authenticity of this film. At that time,there were ONLY 350,000,000 persons living there and I met so many who knew the Mahatma personally,including Mr. Nehru himself.   Could any film ever faithfully convey the nuances of that extra-ordinary man and those phenomenal times,and with sensitivity? Probably not, but with the included rare films of Gandhi-ji himself and Ben Kingsley's comments, this film represents a courageous effort! It sows the seeds for deeper study... Recommended highly!
0385513755|5.0|I've read the story book first in the original publication, and I'd have to say it's quite a good mystery book, easy read.<br /><br />But this version with the art work and illustration included is excellent, it makes so much more sense for the reader now that they can visually identify and confirm what the author's talking about. It's so much easier instead of searching on the web for the images. =)
0671015206|4.0|I wish I could have read this years ago. I would be well on my way to retirement.
B000E5N62U|5.0|Membership in dan fandom requires an appreciation for the catalyst of Steely Dan...Donald Fagen.  Yeah, I agree with the others who say Morph is not The Nightfly.  But nothing ever will be.  Nightfly is the gold standard and still sounds as cool today as it did in '82, and it always will.  But this is Fagen, it is New York.  And Morph has got something that keeps you hanging around for more, much like Nightfly does.  Great Pagoda of Funn is vintage raw Donald Fagen and reminds us why we have loved him for 34 great years...and counting.  If you haven't seen Steely Dan or Fagen live, do so if you have any chance.  It will be the greatest musical experience you ever experience.  He dedicates this effort to his mother's memory.  She'd be mighty proud.
B000E6UK5K|3.0|I am a long time Gilmour, Waters and Pink Floyd fan, but have to say this is a weak album. Sounds too much like an attempt to sound like Pink Floyd. Not unlike Divison Bell or the MLOR. Waters can succeed without Gilmour, but Gilmour always falls short in his attempts. They both need each other to be great again. I have trouble listening to this album all the way through. Couple of good songs, but definitely no classics here.
1592400876|5.0|This is a great book for anyone who is interested in improving his or her writing. The author explains things simply and clearly, and, to keep the book entertaining, she includes many amusing examples of ambiguities or misstatements that resulted from the careless use of punctuation.

0743490304|3.0|fun book, just like his others.  some parts tend to drag, but overall very entertaining.  if i had to choose, this one is better than digital fortress.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|If it ain't broke, don't fix it. It's a regular disapointment to me that most artists don't seem to know what exactly is special about themselves. Clapton gets lost in the ideas of whatever producer he's working with, and (Jeff) Beck chases the latest trend to the horror of his original fans. Gilmour's sound and style has been perfected, and is not in need of change.

B000BEZQ18|5.0|A great CD for the music from the movie.  It is amazing how listening to the music can bring back the emotion from seeing the film.  Gustavo Santaolalla is a genius at representing emotions through music.   <br /> <br />
0953104907|4.0|Although the superficial first chapters are geared to the clueless, they do provide the background knowledge that anyone would need before hitting the middle part of the book which gets down to the nitty gritty and shows the actual building of an electric guitar, and that's what I bought it for. This book comes close to being all you'll need to get you going!
B00000K19E|5.0|La historia es una de esas ya conocidas: unos pocos se unen para organizar la rebelin contra el Imperio omnipoderoso del mal, encarnado esta vez por mquinas de inteligencia artificial creadas por los mismos hombres en un acto de hybris, antes de perder la guerra contra las computadoras y en consecuencia ser condenados a una vida de esclavos, meras fuentes de energa para los aparatos.    Y para que nadie se de cuenta de su triste destino, la gente vive en eterna ilusin, un mundo creado por computadoras, enteramente virtual: la vida como simulacion del cmputo. Y claro,los rebeldes son unos hackers geniales, que a travs de su hroe (Keanu Reeves) salvan a la humanidad al despertarla de su sueo creado por las computadoras.    Nada nuevo, entonces. Pero lo que me gust mucho es el tono de la pelcula, entre de irona y patetismo, con muchsimas citas de otras pelculas, del gnero western en particular (una escena de high noon en el metro, con peridicos volando en el viento, en vez de sagebrush), los special effects muy logrados (y casi todos hechos con la compu), y la contradiccin puesta a propsito en la decoracin: telfonos ya anticuados en un mundo totalmente computarizado, el submarino que sirve de base a los rebeldes con aspecto de la nave del Capitn Nemo, muebles gastados en un ambiente de Blade Runner,etc, etc.    Es casi una parbola de una sociedad dormida, narcotizada por una mezcla perfecta de discursos polticos, ignorancia forzada y voluntaria y la television... la vida como simulacin, y la gente contenta...(comentario original despu?s del estreno, 1999)
B000002P5W|5.0|Not quite as earth-shattering as Are you Experienced or Electric Ladyland, Axis is, nevertheless, Hendrix's most pretty list of songs. 'Little Wing' and 'Castles made of sand' are eviedence of one of the greatest composers of popular music.<br /><br />One of my favorite tracks is the one that shows the most jazz influence - 'Up from the skies'...
B00003CX5P|1.0|This movie is a depressing waste of time for any true Star Wars fan.  The story is incoherent, the acting is weak, Jar Jar Binks is the most annoying Star Wars character ever, Jake Lloyd's Anakin is a close second, and the fact that half movie revolves around the pod race, which is really just an excuse to show off special effects technology, makes this the worst Star Wars movie of all!  I'll never forget how amazingly dissappointed I was when I first saw this.  It lacks all the spirit of the originals, and is a soulless phony.
B000002JNN|5.0|NASTY BIZNESS REALLY.... The 1990 album by AC/DC tore the rock world up upon initial release (#2 on the charts). Since about 1983, the powerhouse had somewhat fallen between the cracks. Drifting futher and futher away with each release in the eighties.. not that every AC/DC disc ain't worthy of five stars, its just that some are a little bit weaker than others. RAZORS EDGE cut the boys in, with this record they were officially gods of rock and roll... and the biggest tour boat for the next few years to follow. \\"We're not worthy!....\\"<br />THUNDERSTRUCK opens this thing. You can feel chills down your spine when the boys come in. Yeah, they sound a little ragged, a little older, and a little worn down, but they sound more powerful than ever all at once. As Brian Johnson chokes out the opening lines a heavy wave of satisfaction rolls over you... ITS TIME TO F'IN ROCK!!!!!<br />Next on the plate is FIRE YOUR GUNS, this song is just another pure rock satisfaction. This showed just about every other rock outfit at the time where to stick it. Its so good LOUDER! YEAH YEAH YEAH, YOU WANT SOME FUN?....<br />MONEY TALKS rounds in at number three. This was the next big single, and is a great time too... these are the lyrics you expect to hear from the worlds down and dirtiest rock and roll band... life is good. After that is the eerie sounding title track, which is a little different than what a fan may be used to, but pretty damned good just the same. The oddly placed MISSTRESS FOR CHRISTMAS is a flounder, but still, really not that bad.<br />After that you get ROCK YOUR HEART OUT an old fashioned rawker, then ARE YOU READY? a sort of 1990 type song, but still very enjoyable... GOT YOU BY THE BALLS, you know there has to be a song like that on here at some point.. and well... just keep rocking with your hand in the air, cuz AC/DC kicks your ass no matter what. Grab this disc and cruise the streets with the sound UP and the windows DOWN, remind people what it means to have a good time!!!!! YES!!! Heeeeere Coooommmmmeeees thhhhe raaaaazzzzzooorrrrsss eeeeddddgggee!S!!! Heeeeere Coooommmmmeeees thhhhe raaaaazzzzzooorrrrsss eeeeddddgggee!
B000BBOUU4|1.0|Was Tim Burton on acid for the entire duration? This film is all syrup with no substance and seems 'rushed' as a previous reviewer stated. Why remake something that was already done and done with a grace,charm and style - all without the use of sickly slick computer generated effects. Johnny Depp as Wonka did not impress either. Without any outside influence, I found him to be very 'michaeljacksonesque' and grossly inferior as Wonka when inevitably compared to the genius that Gene Wilder contributed to the character. Wilder is a genius.Period. Depp is ...well.. not! This like most 'remakes'- Planet of the Apes comes to mind are just travesties and should be comitted to the bin.GIVE IT A MISS..
B000089CJI|5.0|The Postal Sevice.  Most people know them, whether it be from the superstardom of Ben Gibbard, the genious music of Jimmy Tamborello (DNTEL, Figurine, ect.) Iron and Wine's cover of Such Great Heights featured on Garden State, among other reasons.  The Postal Service, as already mentioned, is composed of Ben Gibbard (Death Cab for Cutie) and Jimmy Tamborello (DNTEL).  Give Up, The Postal Service's first (and most likely only) album is one great pop record.  Beautifully crafted electro-pop with stellar vocals from the great Gibbard.  Melancholy, yet happy.  Give Up is great.  A must for fans of indie, electronica, or just great pop music.
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|Walt Disney has never been very interested in staying authentic to the fairy tales, fables, and legends that it uses as fodder for many of the animated movies that they make. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, ALADDIN, CINDERELLA, PINOCCHIO, and company are all quite different than the original stories they are based upon (in fact, the only time animated Disney movies have attempted to be authentic was in the telling of MULAN--why is that?). Therefore, it shouldn't be surprising that in CHICKEN LITTLE about the only things that remain from the classic tale which was to be a warning of believing everything you hear are the names of the characters and the idea of the sky falling.<br /><br />In this version of the story, Chicken Little is a teenage chicken that has yet to have a growth spurt. In fact, he hasn't grown much at all since he was born. So, Chicken Little has a few issues about his height. Also, his mother died when he was younger and he's being raised by his dad. Chicken's dad was a huge baseball star when he was in school and he had dreams that his son would follow in his footsteps. Unless Chicken starts to grow, that's probably never going to happen.<br /><br />Besides the whole height thing, Chicken Little also another issue he has to deal with. One fine sunny day, Chicken was up in the top of the bell tower at school and swore he was hit on the head by a piece of sky, but some acorns were. Chicken became infamous instantly. A year later he and his father are hoping to have put the past behind them, but with the upcoming movie about to be released of Chicken Little's misadventures, it doesn't seem likely. As Chicken tries to work through issues with his dad, he's once again knocked in the head with a piece of sky and this time he keeps it to show his friends. That piece of sky leads Chicken and his friends to discover an alien spaceship with assumed plans to destroy their world. It's then left up to chicken and his friends to try to save their town and the world.<br /><br />CHICKEN LITTLE has some really interesting characters. There's Foxy Loxy, Mayor Turkey Lurkey, Abby Mallard (Ugly Duckling), Goosey Loosey, Runt of the Litter, and Fish Out of Water. These characters have some really interesting personalities, but the best thing about them are the actors who perform their voices. Zach Braff voices Chicken Little, Joan Cusack voices Abby Mallard, Steve Zahn voices Runt of the Litter, and even Patrick Warburton gets in on the gig as an Alien Cop. The film is also noteworthy because it was Don Knotts last performance (as Mayor Turkey Lurkey)./><br />CHICKEN LITTLE has some really interesting characters.

B000002GQH|5.0|<br />Exactly like the original LP & the music quality very good.  Would like a complete collection and will definitely be ordering again.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|It's been out 27 years, where have you been? Yes The Clash are punk but you dont need to be into that to enjoy London Calling. Forget the Sex Pistols, this is a band who truely do something for music.   <br /> <br />Upon listening to this for the first time you may be surprised by the wide variety of styles contained within.  Overall the album is hugely fun to listen to and contains many great lyrics and melodies.  When a band release an album of this stature other bands within their genre must be cursing under their breath.  Other bands aspire to produce something this brilliant and fun.  After all, music is meant to be fun in part and how many albums actually are? <br /> <br />London Calling- one of the few 'cool' albums that are actually great.  Buy this if you have any value in music.

B000BOH8XW|4.0|I hear good and bad things on her second CD following Fijacion Oral 1. I love Shakira and always will, and I admire the fact that all her songs seem to be like a diary of my love life! Every hit song just knocks me on my head, as she seems to astonishingly describe the pains or happiness a woman goes through in relationships. At least for me it does! I can relate a lot to \\"Don't Bother\\"...boy was that a reality check for me! But you got to get her 3rd release of Oral Fixation 2, with added song \\"Hips Don't Lie\\"...every latin woman knows that when we move our hips, we don't lie. We mean it! \\"AND I'M ON TONIGHT, YOU KNOW MY HIPS DON'T LIE AND I'M STARTING TO FEEL IT'S RIGHT, ALL THE ATTRACTION, THE TENSION, DON'T YOU SEE BABY, THIS IS PERFECTION\\"...With our moves we don't lie, and it's what makes men go gaga over...after all, THEY DON'T LIE! And if you've seen the video, she looks incredibly awesome...I haven't bought the 2nd album, but I am going to wait for the other release, and i'm sure my hips will be moving to perfection on the dancefloor!

It is a very hands on plan covering all the important aspects of a successful transition and the foundations for a sucessful career in the organization. <br /> <br />I recommend specially chapters 5 and 6 that cover alignment and expectations. <br /> <br />The great value of the book is that it comprises all the experience accumulated by numerous managers and strategies that have allowed many of them to climb the organization in a very solid way within a strategic frame.  It provides answers to many questions that every manager has and has to go through a coach or many books to find suitable answers. <br />

B000001FS3|5.0|What can you say about U2? Quite alot apparently. There are those that love them and those that loathe them. Whatever you say about them, there is no denying that The Joshua Tree is something special. No doubt this is the album that put them firmly on the map despite being around for about ten years and releasing considerable efforts such as War and The Unforgettable Fire. Most people knew them but when Joshua Tree was released tens of thousands actually owned a piece of their work.    Over twenty years old the album still holds its own and actually starts off sounding like a greatest hits album. Such classic singles such as With or Without You, Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For and Where The Streets Have No Name are just so good and well known that its easy to forget that they all come from one album. I believe that this is the point that Bono found his true voice. In earlier releases he sounded like every other new band to come out during the early 80's, but here his vocals are spot on and the start of the Bono that we have all come to recognise and, most of us, love. This in itself breathes freshness into the bands sound but add that to superior song writing and The Edge's new guitar sound and we have a giant leap forward from the Irish lads.    There is a nice mix of songs here but they all help with the overall feel of the album. It's easy to emagine being in the desert that is pictured on the cover as the sound perpetuating every track give off that feel of the desert. Every song seems to fit perfectly after the previous one taking us alone through this journey of the desert. All great albums should have this sense of wholeness within it, rather than being just a collection of songs, even if they are great ones. To me this is what Joshua Tree does. Put any other U2 song in and it wouldnt fit, take one of these ones out and the album would collapse. Each track relies on the others to balance out this mood.    However good your music collection may be, ifthis is not included then you having a glaring chasm in it. This is U2's best. Even if you do not like U2 then you should at least try this album. It may change your mind and, if not, then at least you are being open minded.    1. Where The Streets Have No Name: A great opener for an album. This track slowly builds up to the hit that it is well known for being.    2. I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For: Another classic single, this track can be read on many levels. Perhaps this is one reason why it was so popular. People identified with it in different ways, people's questioning life and answers, looking for that special someone or that drive in life. All or none of these can be applied to this song. Bono surely has his own interpretation of it but he purposely leaves it ambiguous for the listener.    3. With Or Without You: Maybe the best known, and over played, track of the album, and perhaps their entire career.    4. Bullet The Blue Sky: My least favourite of the `big songs' on here, this track is still quite powerful and deserves its place. The guitar and drums in the intro again evoke the desert feel.    5. Running To Stand Still: It's a tragedy that this track isn't more well known. This is such an understated song, Bono tempers his voice well here, not overdoing it but putting the exact amount of feeling into it. A beautiful and simple pleasure, easily one of the best U2 songs ever.    6. Red Hill Mining Town: Some of Bono's finest vocals are present on this track. Bono screams `I'm hanging on, You're all that's left to hold on to' and you can feel it in his voice.    7. In God's Country: A catchy song that doesn't quite impress but is a good listen nontheless and should never be skipped when listening through the album.    8. Trip Through Your Wires: The harmonica that opens the song seems a bit out of place, especially this late on in the album. There is nothing really special about the song, it's pleasant enough but too mediocre to follow the previous great tracks.    9. One Tree Hill: Again, another understated song. Whilst this isn't as good as other tracks, it is still a good solid piece. Just about everything is underplayed, the guitar, the vocals but the lyrics are really quite good.    10. Exit: For me, this is the weakest of the album. It doesn't fit as much as the other songs and it sounds more dated, harking back to a sound of the early 80's. The slow build up really doesn't end with anything worthwhile.    11. Mothers Of The DisappearedL: A simple tribute to the women who lose their children to kidnappers and slavery. A beautiful guitar riff plays gently behind Bono's soft singing. A slow track but definitely one to listen to several times before being judged.
B00005221M|4.0|This movie is alot of bang for the buck. A very good product and price. However, it lacks in special features.
0452286751|2.0|Having read both large works of Rand, I am mystified by their popularity in one sense They are not books that are believable. If anyone was to act the way her characters do (at work)  they would be pounding the pavement looking for a new job. Of course one should stand true to their convictions and should be honest with others- but the ways in which her characters talk and act are often rude, wooden, stilted, childish and fake. Sometimes they sound brilliant and other times they are way way out.    One thing I noticed is that none of her characters ever lighten up, have a good time, enjoy life or ever have much fun. They are all so heavy, boring, philosophical and dry. The sexual escapades in which Rand's women find themsleves are absolutely pathetic- never any guilt, pregnancies or doubt. Rand was married and must have been a tyrant to live with (I've never seen a photo of her smiling).    There are interesting portions of the book but do not try to emulate the life of Roark- you'll be penniless, hated and shunned.    Her obvious atheism (man is the center of her universe and she never mentions God except in swearing) is troubling to me also. Man's chief end is not to worship his work and career but it is much more profound than that. I mention the religious aspect of man because Rand's philosophy (Objectivism) professes to be the true way men should live while on earth. She never considers the spiritual side of men except that they worship each other, work  and money.  Her philosophy (she justifies being totally self centered) has been weighed in the balance and found terribly wanting. Man is meant for eternity and Rand only concerns herself with this life on earth and materialism. The chief end of man (according to the old Westminster Confession of Faith) is to \\"glorify God and enjoy Him forever\\". In this aspect Rand hasn't a clue.
B000002GHH|5.0|This was my first John Hiatt CD.  I loved it so much that I've purchased several others since.  This is still my favorite.  In my opinion, John Hiatt is a great singer/songwriter that doesn't get the attention he deserves.
0783230079|5.0|This DVD was purchased as a gift for a friend.  She had been looking for a copy in Australia, but it was impossible to find.  As part of her birthday present I purchased a copy from Amazon.com, she said it was the best present she received.  Her children watched the movie and loved it.  It is a funny, heart warming story that will appeal to all age groups.  My son has also watched the movie and insists that we purchase a copy as well - I knew I should have bought 2 copies. <br />This film is one of my all time favourites, and Robert Downey Junior does a fantastic job. I would highly recommend it.
B00005JLYW|4.0|The original Charlie's Angels rocked, but this one roars--it kicks ass.  The girls are hot, as always, and Demi Moore is really hot for being how old she is.  This movie may be somewhat unbelievable, but it still rocks.  The special effects are brilliant, the acting is comedic and the plotline is pretty solid--all that's really missing is the believability of how you can tell someone (in detail) by their shoe print.  Other than that stretch, though, Charlie's Angels 2 is a kick-ass movie full of kick-ass moves and kick-ass brillance.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Hendrix elevated electric guitars to a higher level than ever.  Every great guitarist has been measured by Jimi's standards and most of the new musicians today have been inspired by him. <br /> <br />This is a great collection which shows Jimi doing what he does best, wailing on the guitar.  For someone who hasn't heard much of Jimi's work, this album is a brilliant place to start.  Alot of his albums are very abstract with endless guitar solos that can be hard to get in to for a beginner, but this collection has all the right tunes and melodies to get that beginner strapped in and ready for some classic guitar rock.  Having said that, there are a few songs which feature amazing solos and the casual listener will find these highly thrilling and be comfortable with them. <br /> <br />If you own all of Jimi's albums, this collection is a nice way of having alot of favourites bundled together on one cd.  However, these days with mp3 players and computer libraries, it is easy to create playlists of favourite songs or albums and string them together.  So, die hard fans of Hendrix would not find it necessary to purchase this as the collection holds nothing new. <br /> <br />If you are a Jimi virgin then this album breaks you in to his best work.  Once you have devoured these pieces then you are ready to go out and buy the albums which feature longer, bigger, louder and better solos and visions by one of the greatest musicians of the twentieth century. <br /> <br />
B000CNESU8|5.0|`Network', directed by Sidney Lumet, written by Paddy Chayefsky, and directed by Howard Gottfried is one of those great iconic movies which probably received less than its total due at the Academy Awards, based on the great reverence with which it is held today, with a release of a two disc 30th Anniversary edition DVD of the movie and a collection of extras. While I am tempted to pan the somewhat expensive special edition for its thin extras, I can't bring myself to show any disrespect for this truly excellent movie.<br /><br />The most important thing the extra features underscore is the fact that this movie is not primarily a comedy, dark drama, satire, or parody. It is one of the finest examples have seen of a speculative essay on the trends in a major industry. The power of the movie has grown over the last 30 years simply because virtually every one of the script's projections of the future of commercial television, up to, but not quite including the corporate assassination of a person on camera, has come true. The movie is grimly prophetic about both the development of reality TV and the transition of news programming into entertainment.<br /><br />Part of the reason the movie may not have gotten `best picture' in 1976 is because it is so obviously an actor's movie, with five acting nominations going to Faye Dunaway (winner, Best Actress), Peter Finch (winner, Best Actor), William Holden (nominated for Best Actor), Beatrice Straight (winner, best supporting actress), and Ned Beatty (nominated for Best Supporting Actor). In fact this movie may be the very best performances, or at least among the very best performances by the four principles, not to mention the short but powerful scene by Beatty, who fills his billing by Burt Reynolds as the guy who comes on the set for a few days and steals the show. He didn't quite steal the show here, but his performance is probably second only in memorability to Peter Finch's monumental `I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore' scene.<br /><br />This sentence and the movie won a place among the top five most commonly quoted movie lines, just behind Clark Gable's `I don't give a damn' and Casablanca's `Play it again, Sam'. What the commentary on this edition shows, among other things, is that the writer and director had no premonition of how powerful a moment they had created until they saw the movie with a theatre audience.<br /><br />The movie works so well as a speculation on the future of TV because the three principal moviemakers, Lumet, Chayefsky, and Gottfried all started out in live television. Another reason the movie seems to work so well is that except for Holden, all the major actors as well as Lumet, had stage acting experience and Lumet rehearsed as if it were a stage play, which is very uncommon in typical Hollywood scenes.<br /><br />It is not as obvious in this movie as it is in an average Woody Allen movie, but the entire movie was shot on location in and around New York City, except for the location shots in a rented movie studio in Toronto. This `Verite' partially hides the fact that the movie was done with a relatively low budget, with all its major stars working for less than their usual salaries.<br /><br />My favorite and single most valuable extra on this and any other movie is the voice-over commentary by the film's principles. Unfortunately, Chayefsky is no longer with us; director Lumet does so all the commentary. At a somewhat lower price, this extra would have been more than enough for me, as much of the additional extras simply duplicate what Lumet says on the commentary, to much greater effect, since you hear the comment in context.<br /><br />The second most revealing fact we get from the commentary is how Lumet and his cameraman systematically played with the lighting so that in the beginning of the film, everything is very natural looking and midway through the movie, the lighting starts getting more and more surreal, until in the penultimate scene, where the Network execs are plotting the assassination, the lighting is totally surreal.<br /><br />Next to Lumet's various comments, the most interesting contribution to the extras is the observations on her role by Faye Dunaway, which netted her second Oscar nomination and first win. It is, I believe, to this day, her finest performance, far more memorable than her role in `Bonny and Clyde'.<br /><br />Aside from the durability of the film, the voice-over commentary doubles the value of watching the movie.<br /><br />Very highly recommended for film fans!in the penultimate scene, where the Network execs are plotting the assassination, the lighting is totally surreal. <br /> <br />Next to Lumet's various comments, the most interesting contribution to the extras is the observations on her role by Faye Dunaway, which netted her second Oscar nomination and first win.

B0006EHRDI|5.0|_When I reread this book after so many years I found myself wondering if we were ever really like this. The innocence, the lack of pretention, the sincerity - it is so totally alien from what this society has become. Sure Jack Kerouac had his problems with booze and relationships, but at his core there was somehow this absolutely blinding glare of innocent purity. Here was a man whose primary concerns were always the meaning of life, the nature of god, the suffering of innocents, whether he was boozing it up in a bar, hopping a freight, or hold up in a look-out cabin on top of a mountain. Jack Kerouac was a true poet in a world were poetry was in abysmal decline both before and after. Jack Kerouac's life was a spontaneous living poem- the dionysian poem of the living holy fool.<br /><br />_This is my favorite of all Kerouac's novels. I've had people comment about how I must have patterned a huge part of my early life on this book. I remember thinking so too, except all my wandering and wondering took place before I even heard of Jack or his books....

B000002UB3|5.0|I wasn't going to do a review of a Beatles album for some time but as it is Beatles Day here in England then I can hardly pay a small tribute to the fab four.    I cannot say anything new about Abbey Road, it has had nearly four decades of reviews and praise. Just think about it, this work of art is nearly fourty years old. Compare it to the `best' albums of last year. It still feels fresh and original and outranks anything that last year had to offer.    This was the last album recorded by the Beatles, after a stunning career of sublime hits and wondrous works of art they top it all off by one of their best efforts and one of the best albums ever. My favourite has always been Revolver but Abbey Road has always been second place only just. These days I think this album my just be my favourite Beatles Album.    This is such an iconic work of the twentieth century, from the famous and often imitated cover, to the fabulous melodies and lyrics. Which brings me to ask: Why are you reading this? If it is because you do not own this album, or even worse, have never heard it then quickly get it ordered and downloaded before someone sees you. Everyone should own this, in fact, in England you are sent it in the post once you become of age. It is that important to everyday life. That may be over the top but it certainly is essential to everyone's music collection, even if you only have a few albums.    One of the joys is that each member of the band seems to be at their best on this album. Even Ringo proves his critics wrong by showing them up with a great drum solo during the album's closing medley. Paul belts out some cracking vocals, very powerful stuff, John rocks like never before and George presents some of his finest songs ever. Individually they all shine in their own right and when they come together (pardon the pun) they shake the earth with their brilliance.    This album has the traits of genius running all the way through it from beginning to end. It is the traitthat binds every song together to deliver the world a package of true beauty that continues to inspire and move people even after all these years.    There are a few weak tracks, mainly novelty songs, but these are merely small blips on an otherwise shining record. The highs are certainly well worth the lows.    Buy it now. Listen to it forever. You will never tire of it and neither will your neighbours if you turn it up.    Come Together- Paul's bass line opens the album, then kick in the crazy lyrics. This is a good track but I wouldn't place it in say their top 10 songs. It is just missing something to take it beyond the norm.....for a Beatles track anyway, which means it's still pretty good.    Something- A simple beautiful song, George Harrison really knows how to write a moving song whilst keeping it simple, even the brilliant guitar solo is just a simple and wonderful piece of music. Absolutely nothing over the top about this track. One of the best Harrison songs.    Maxwell's Silver Hammer-The first novelty song. A tale of a serial killer who hits people over the head, told in a light and amusing way. This song is ok, it's fine....the first few times. After a while it is certainly a track that you are going to want to skip. Even Lennon didn't like it!    Oh! Darling-Sung by McCartney I think his voice sounds great on this, even if Lennon thought that he should have recorded this instead.    Octopus's Garden-Whilst being quite catchy, I really do not like this song. It sounds too cheesy, childish lyrics, adequate vocals and nothing more.    I Want You (She's So Heavy)-Overly long. That's the first thought that comes into my head. It has some good moments but not enough to keep it interesting for 7:47. The guitar intro is great as are some little jam moments, the vocals are also very good throughout. But there is also too much that just doesn't work.    Here Comes The Sun- An amazing song, once again written by George Harrison. From the very start it's beautygrabs you. The guitar throughout is pure perfection, the lyrics shine and gradually the song blossoms into the work of genius that it is. It is both optimistic and uplifting.    Because- It is not the best track, though a very solid one, on the album but it is a great showcase for the band. Stripped of all the trimmings that a lot of bands need to sound good, the fab four deliver amazing vocals and harmonies, only bettered by the Beach Boys. After all, the Beatles were primarily a vocal band and this song clearly reminds us of this. A fine performance.    You Never Give Me Your Money- A lovely song, sung in McCartney's best voice. The piano in the first half is great, the harmony in the second half very pretty and the guitar is once again brilliant yet not overdone.    Sun King- Sit back and relax, here comes the mid-album chill out zone. The first minute sounds similar to Fleetwood Mac's Albatross.    Mean Mr Mustard- Despite being a novelty song, it is much better than the previous two. Plus, it is only a minute long. Quite catchy, silly lyrics, nothing terrible here and nice little jaunt that quickly leads into...    Polythene Pam- One of the few times I actually notice John's accent. A daft song with a great intro that bursts open from the end of the previous track. Again, only a short song but very catchy.    She Came In Through the Bathroom Window- Written by Paul about a fan that did what the title says. This is a great follow on from Polythene Pam, the change is fantastic.    Golden Slumbers- Soaring strings, soft piano, gentle bass; a wonderful start to this song. Then we get Paul's top-notch vocals come in during the chorus. Another gentle dip and then it goes straight into...    Carry That Weight- `You never give me your money' makes a comeback halfway in, with different lyrics, then back to Carry That Weight and then, without looking backwards we plunge into....    The End- The band on flawless form; guitars, vocals, melody and Ringo all merge into one great showmanship of their abilities. The last great piece of music they laid down. For many this is the highlight of the entire album and it is kind of hard to disagree with them.    Her Majesty- 23 seconds long and a novelty song once again. I don't see the point of this and certainly it's position on the album. We've just heard a magnificent medley of several songs and then the last track would have been an awesome and perfect end to the album and then this gets put in right at the end.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|Happy to find they do live up to the hype. Particularly love the 'Amelie' sample on Track 2.
B0009RJPC8|5.0|After seeing James Blunt perform on Oprah, I got his CD. I have been singing his praises ever since. I cannot stop listening to it.

0060987464|5.0|Manson's artistry is undeniable in every medium he chooses to affect.  This book allows the reader insight into the mind of Manson, so be prepared for it.  The author has executed a new perspective that is, even if not to be shared in everyway, demanding of respect.
B000002UB3|1.0|First off I'm not a beatle hater or basher and I do understand their importance in music and cultural history but I'm also not a fan. Yes they were big back in the day but now they just sound very dated but the older generation still keeps pushing them on us. Yes they do have some good songs but not on this album. Most of them are kindda childish sounding like this cd was aimed at children. Towards the end the songs are very very short like they came up with a little tune that couldn't become a whole song so they just stuck those unfinished songs on the album. I think the song Maxwell's hammer is funny because the lyrics are about Maxwell killing people with his hammer while the music to the song is very happy. Anyways the beatles were #1 back in the 60's but we now have much more to offer in the ways of music. There are also good bands from the 60's though like the Who and the Beach Boys.
B0000Z80HU|5.0|In my humble opinion, Seachange is Beck's best work. The music and lyrics are synchronized perfectly, creating moods of anger, despair, and loss. Even more outstanding is the production of the music itself, with an atmospheric quality that is eerie yet hauntingly beautiful. I purchased the CD when it first was released but replaced that copy with the release of the DVD audio version which allows the music to soar with a 5.1 surroundsound mix. Highly recommended.
B00002MZ4W|4.0|There aren't many female solo artists I really like but Fiona Apple is one of them.  <br />She's cool and real. Great to listen to in those contemplative moods when you want to feel stronger.
B00004ZAV3|1.0|What makes them so special? Does any one band deserve to be put on a pedestal? I'm not claiming to dismiss The Beatles although every time they play a song of theirs on the radio, I can't help but shudder at the awful production, the awful singing and.....well OK, I know \\" at the time\\" these songs were the thing to listen to but they've aged terribly. I just don't understand how there music has survived today. I've heard people comment on how fresh their songs sound and I completely disagree, they sound stale, irritating and in really bad quality. I would normally say \\" I suppose you had to be there \\" but this is The Beatles we're talking about. The band that everyone must shut up and like as it's an \\" education into everything music was,\\" and think that you are the biggest fool who ever walked the Earth. I've heard plenty of their songs and they presented the worst ideas I've heard for music.  <br /> <br />Of course, people will point out that if you don't like The Beatles, you don't like pop music. That's not strictly true, I generally like all music and I can see that somewhere along the line The Beatles have helped contribute in some respects, but their songs are pathetic themselves. It's just a standard routine that people love to build a band up to such huge proportions to be something that they are not. Ultimately I know that writing this is a useless cause because, admittedly, there are very few people who would go out and say they hate The Beatles. So obviously, if you are already a fan of The Beatles, you'll disagree with how I could hate the music of the band. All I'm saying is, is that I disagree that they were an ordinary band, nothing special, nothing of the greatness that people usually talk of when regarding The Beatles, but of course that's simply not acceptable, we're supposed to be programmed to like them.
0440241413|5.0|Its amazing how Sophia takes a basic concept like shopping and turns it into a series of events that all seem to end in disastrous situations. Many times have I felt the same as the heroine in the novel on the importance of just having that little something to make my life so much better. Its amazing what shopping can do for the soul....however like everything all in moderation.
B00004ZAV3|1.0|The beatles are highly overrated. Yes they did help influence many people who went on to make better music like Ozzy Osbourne, and yes they made rock and roll more popular and brought it mainstream. They changed a whole generation and it's music and for that I thank them and I also understand their importance in music history now with that said these songs are bad. They are very annoying and not because they are 60's pop music. I have heard much more of their song that were okay and only about 2 of these songs are worth listening to. So I'm guessing that even beatle fans wouldn't like this cd that much so if you do like the beatles then check out another best of of theirs or something.

Watch what you say around these dames cause it will come back to bite you!  The humor and script are sharp and funny - they aren't making movies like this anymore. ....even the caliber of women actors today does not measure up to these women of 1939.  The best part is there are NO men in the entire picture!  The fashions are glamorous and gorgeous and fantastic.  Truly a marvelous classic!
067144901X|3.0|A great story about animal sounds.  Most of the sounds are accurate, however I have a problem with the 3 singing pigs...would they really sing \\"La, La, La\\"?  Would a child recognize Boynton's use of rhyme and really \\"get it\\"?  I think not...I'm having a hard time now, when I took my son to the farm and he was saying \\"La La La\\" at the pigs...while all the other kids were saying \\"oink\\" or were more accurately making a snorting sound.  Their parents looked at my son as if he was not as smart as their genius kids who knew the proper pig sounds.<br /><br />Thanks Ms. Boynton...thanks a lot.
0385338082|5.0|This was another great book by Sophia Kinsella. Here again, like in Confessions, she takes a mundane life event and transforms it into a series of mishaps. We all in our lives keep secrets but only Kinsella shows how those secrets end up causing havoc on our heroine's work and love life. By the way, where does she come up with these yummy heros for the books. I'd so like to meet Jack Harper!

0446677450|3.0|As a long-time critic of the self-help movement--its \\"get financial freedom now!\\" wing in particular--I have mixed emotions about this book, which I've read twice now, and to which I've devoted considerable thought. On the one hand, there's no question that it presents certain core financial principles that are beyond dispute (at least in a free-market society). Among them is Kiyosaki's bedrock argument, which is that those who put their money to work for them will realize larger, faster returns than those who simply work for money. And, the book is an entertaining read, with plenty of real-life anecdotes to enliven what would otherwise be dry advice.    <br /> <br />On the other hand, this book--as much as anything to come out of the wealth-building genre--exemplifies the key problem with the movement as a whole: the fact that most people cannot do what the author would have them do. Understand, it's not a matter of choice or \\"will\\"; it's the (basically) closed-system nature of the market itself. We simply can't all be chiefs, owning our own businesses and/or letting our investments or OPM (other people's money) work for us. There is room at the top for only a handful of such people. In fact--and by definition--those who truly succeed at Kiyosaki's system DEPEND on the fact that most other people will NOT embrace that system. (If that were not the case, the whole plan would collapse.) Now, one could argue that by reading this book, you can become one of the handful...and that's fine. Just understand that the odds are against you. <br /> <br />I recently wrote a review of Dave Barry's new book, Money Secrets. (That's the main reason I reread Kiyosaki's book, for comparison purposes, and as a \\"refresher course.\\") Though Barry writes with tongue-in-cheek, and intends his book as satire, I honestly feel that you're better off with Barry than with Kiyosaki. And no, as DB himself might put it, I am not making that up...
B0007PAMR4|3.0|I clearly remember watching this version of the film on WPIX back in 1987, and indeed memories are fond... for a while at last. On the positive side of things, this is the best audio and image quality DUNE has been available since its theatrical release, and stands proud when compared with the letterboxed laserdisc version or the previous DVD transfer. Also, it's a pleasure to watch some of the magic behind scenes, get some extra flavor from the deleted scenes and the picture galleries. However, this release falls behind as it's basically the same 1987 TV version that I clearly remember. Not a single change, but the sound and image improvement. The bonus are very limited, and lacking in scope, running in less than 40 minutes, something sad for a film with such legendary fame. There's no director's commentary, interview or anything related with David Lynch for a good reason: he disowned the TV version, and I'm sure that he never looked back into the DUNE universe. If there's a 4 hours version sitting somewhere, I'm sure we'll never see it, precisely because of this bad blood between the producer and the director. My advise is to buy it, so you can enjoy the theatrical version with bells and whistles. Regarding the badly cut and rough TV (extended) version, just look at it thinking on what it could have been, and never was.
006056251X|5.0|I won't go into a song and dance about the plot and story because it's already been done by other reviewers. Having said that I really thought this was Lisa Kleypas' best work to date. I just couldn't put it down. She just seems to get better and better if that is even possible for her. I am never disappointed in her books. I didn't care for Sebastian St. Vincent in \\"It Happened One Autumn\\" but I fell madly in love with him in this book. He was thoroughly redeemed, but, not totally. He still keeps a bit of that devil in him that you will come to find enchanting to say the least and don't want him to lose that quality completely. Why that is what makes him special. Right? I always say it takes a good woman to make a good man (well someone said it once I know) and in this case it couldn't be truer. Throughout the book you just come to adore Evie (you will even cry for her at times)and practically worship Sebastian. I simply hated when I had to put the book down to do something else. I couldn't wait to get back to reading it either. I would read it again in a heartbeat. It was pure magic for me.

B00080ZG10|2.0|First of all Leonardo Dicaprio is the most overrated so-called actor in Hollywood. Casting him again as a grown man is such a joke when he will forever look 12 years old...but with wrinkles. <br />He's too skinny, must measure 34 inches around the chest with a full breath and it still looks like makeup people pasted any facial hair on him. <br /> <br />Then you have to contend with the affected gravelly voice! What am I watching? The Bill Clinton biography???!!! <br /> <br />There were so many scenes of Dica as Howard Hughes seeing fuzz on people's clothes and freaking out; going into the bathroom and not being able to touch items in there and freaking out;someone eats off his plate and he freaks out! Jeez, am I watching TLC about someone's neuroses or something? Oh yeah, then some scenes about him inventing some pretty important airplane ideas. Also Scorsese bonks us over the head incessantly with music from whatever era his particular movies are about so that we, the dumb (I guess) audience, will know what year the scene covers. He did this in Goodfellas and Casino, nearly driving me NUTS because I could not ignore the music. Really, Mr. Scorsese, a nice little title on the screen of what year it is will suffice. <br /> <br />DiCap could not pull off playing Hughes whatsoever, being the mediocre actor he really is and the whole thing was pretty boring and unbelievable. 2 stars for technical achievments only such as the plane crash in the Hollywood Hills.

0375831002|5.0|\\"A human doesn't have a heart like mine. The human heart is a line, whereas my own is a circle, and I have the endless ability to be in the right place at the right time. The consequence of this is that I'm always finding humans at their best and worst. I see their ugly and their beauty, and I wonder how the same thing can be both.\\"    So muses the narrator of Markus Zusak's powerful and moving new novel, THE BOOK THIEF. As you might guess, this is no ordinary narrator. The contemplative first person guiding you through this book is Death, an at-once fitting and ironic vanguard for a tale that both celebrates the power of words and agonizes over the consequences of their use.    Set against the tragedy-stained canvas of World War II, Death tells the story of young Liesel Meminger (the eponymous book thief) growing up in Nazi Germany under the watchful eye of a staunch foster mother and kindly foster father who teaches her to read. She attends meetings of the BDM, a youth group aimed at indoctrinating young girls into Hitler's ideology. She plays soccer with the boys on her street, holding her own in any disputes that arise. And all the while, the dreams of her dead brother haunt and goad her into a fascination with reading and words that inevitably leads to her life of crime.    It is a meeting with Max Vandenburg, a 24-year-old Jewish man being hidden in Liesel's basement by her compassionate foster parents, that alters the course of Liesel's life. Max, too, is haunted by nightmares of a family he lost in the harrowing aftermath of Kristallnacht. Together, Max and Liesel discover a shared love of words that leads to a decisive understanding about the role words play in both bravery and cowardice. Each, in their own way, sets out to use this knowledge to shape the world around them.    While other writers have employed Death as a narrator, Zusak makes his own indelible mark on the technique in the dimensions he gives to the character. Death is simultaneously dispassionate about his work and the impact it can have while striving to understand humanity's resilience. Death boasts an omniscience of what will happen in life but also a naivety about what can happen in the human heart.    In the ultimate expression of his dichotomous theme, Zusak creates a touching love letter to books and writing, framed in arguably the most horrific period in human history. But his greatest triumph is delivering a reminder that no writer enters this world quietly. Writers are born of eruptions and detonations, and the truly exceptional ones, like Zusak, continue to channel these explosive energies to craft a truly remarkable book that will be admired for generations.       --- Reviewed by Brian Farrey [...]
0060555661|5.0|Benjamin Graham's book must be the best-known basic reference for investors in stocks and bonds. I saw him quoted or mentioned often and finally decided to read his most famous work. It is well worth the effort to understand Graham's wisdom, and to see how history keeps repeating itself on Wall Street, with Graham's experiences and again in 2000, as described in Jason Zweig's Commentaries that bring the text up to date to our present era. This book introduces the reader to security analysis in a most interesting way, and shows how to avoid the pitfalls and become a serious Investor rather than Speculator, as Graham defines it. Excellent value!

B000BM6AVA|5.0|Ok I guess I will throw my two cents into the mix here.  I am forty five years old and I have been listening to metal/rock since the '70s when I was in high school.  So I bestow the following compliment with great caution keeping in mind the awesome stature of Hendrix or Zepplin, or any other rock/metal band - you fill in the blank.  This was one of the best rock albums I have ever listened to.  The music was complicated, well written, carefully orchestrated, and at times mysterious.  I cannot remember a rock group that could \\"switch gears\\" so seamlessly going from long discordant perhaps 64th note phrases to a sudden group of very melodic half notes - many times in a different key.  And in the middle of it all Daron and Serj juxtapose their very different voices to match the storm of music swirling around them.  The effect created reminds me alot of John Coltrain's sax runs - a flurry of horizontal, vertical and diagonal notes, but somewhere down the middle is this beautiful humming theme.  The best song on the album is Holy Mountains - a mysterious violin laced gut-wrenching seven minute rock symphony which may well go down as one of the finest rock songs ever penned.  The first time I heard this song I thought to myself that System could have written an entire album using this single theme a la Tull's \\"Thick as a Brick\\" or \\"Passion Play.\\"  In any event this is great music.  Enjoy.

B00005JGAB|5.0|\\"Ramones\\" is an album that succeeds with what seems to be a simple formula. The three chord rock, Joey's one of a kind voice, and somewhat simple beats to the songs come together to form one excellent set of music. This is the band and album that started the \\"punk movement\\". While some may say Iggy or the Who were the first, the Ramones are the first to embrace the punk sound and attitude.  <br /> While on the surface their music may seem to be a simple combination of bubble gum pop rock and simple lyrics underneath the Ramones actually had a complex style and revived true rock n roll. Without them music may have never got out of a stage of Zeppelin wannabes. The energy the band threw into their music was a combination that inspired rebellion and true rock. <br /> The album booms off to a start with the chant of \\"HEY! HO! LETS GO!\\" in \\"Blitzkrieg Bop\\" and doesn't stop until the closing of the album with \\"Today your love, Tomorrow the World\\". (With a few pit stops including the mellow \\"I wanna be your Boyfriend\\"). <br /> The Album includes 7 demos and the single version of \\"Blitzkrieg Bop\\". These give the feeling of the raw, stripped down, version of the Ramones. <br /> Overall this band and album ignited future punk band such as the \\"Sex Pistols\\" and \\"the Clash\\". (please ignore the moron who claims the band to be \\"Metal\\" and any others who bash them and claim greenday as the true punk band. Ps- green day is a good punk band) <br /> <br />Best tracks include: Blitzkrieg Bop, Beat on the Brat, Judy is a punk, I wanna be your boyfriend, Now I wanna sniff some glue, Havana affair, 53rd and 3rd <br /> <br />Enjoy and be sure to then check out other Ramones albums such as Road to Ruin and Rocket to Russia. Then checkout \\"Never mind the Bullocks, Heres the Sex Pistols\\" and various Clash albums. <br />
B00068CVJ4|5.0|I should start this review off by mentioning that I was a huge Mars Volta fan before I ever heard a single song by At The Drive-In, and wasn't expecting the incredibly stark contrast in musical styles.  If you're even visiting this page, you probably already know that ATDI is more of a screamo/punk band unlike the more progressive, experimental The Mars Volta.  As a TMV fan first I'm going to tell you that if you're looking to check out ATDI, this is definitely the first album you want to hear, as it's the easiest transition from TMV. I'm going to end the main part of this review by saying that this album is rough, rough, and rough.  If you want loud, if you want screaming, if you want hard guitars and pounding drums, then stop reading and pick it up!  Let me run down the songs for you and see if I can possibly sum them up. <br /> <br />1. Arc Arsenal - This album starts off with the in-your-face rough sound of this song.  It starts with a nice buildup akin to tribal drumming that you know is going to lead to something loud and it does.  Lots of screaming and a good way to warm you up. <br />2. Pattern Against User - Continuing the roughness of Arc Arsenal but finding a bit more melodicness, this song dares you to get up and move to its straightforward beat.  The bridge to it sort of reminds you of a more emo sound, while sticking to the rough part of the spectrum. <br />3. One Armed Scissor - Heard this song sampled a lot during some MTV reality shows, so if you watch them chances are you have too.  A bit quieter during the verses, but still punch-punch-kick during the loud, screaming chorus. <br />4. Sleepwalk Capsules - This is one of my favorites, it has a great frantic sound during the verses, where it sounds like Cedric is trying to stammer out the lines as quick as possible.  I hate to beat a word to death but another rough one, with a more serene sounding bridge, before finishing up with an ever hard closing. <br />5. Invalid Letter Dept. - This is where thealbum lets you rest a bit.  A slower song that somehow doesn't lose the gritty feel of the rest of the album, but manages to have relaxing trailings-off of the guitar.  The verses are spoken, before treating you to some more borderline screaming during the chorus. <br />6. Mannequin Republic - Another frantic gem, this one starts out hard, and fast!  Probably the fastest song on the album, this one will have your head bobbing during the incredibly catchy chorus. <br />7. Enfilade - A creepy phone call for an opener, followed by what sounds more like a drum machine, accompanied by a little haunting jolt of guitar, and voice effects on Cedric.  A quieter verse that takes you in with the voice effect leads into a great bongo-driven prechorus leading to the ever-welcome screaming chorus. <br />8. Rolodex Propaganda - My absolute favorite song on the album, it starts out much like most of the others, but leads to a prechorus with sampling, a goofy sounding yelp of \\"Manuscript replica!\\" followed by Cedric belting out the words \\"Cut it!\\", all leading into an awesome, angsty sounding chorus.  Great great track. <br />9. Quarantined - The second slowest song on the album, this song is backed by the sound effect of a thunderstorm and another haunting set of the guitar trailing off. <br />10. Cosmonaut - You might need to lower the volume for this one, this is EASILY the loudest track on the album and it starts fast and hard with NO warning.  Cedric is really digging deep on this track with ernest sounding screams and yelling. <br />11. Non-Zero Possibility - The slowest song on the album, it begins with quiet, haunting music that'll stay with you long after the CD is over.  Pianos, a slow beat, and dizzying sampling adds up to the perfect way to ease you out of an intense experience. <br /> <br />I'm sorry if I was a bit too wordy but I love this album and this is the first time I've taken a stab at reviewing music, thanks for taking the time to read this!
B000E6UK5K|1.0|First off, I'm an enthusiastic Floydophile and David Gilmour fan. The guy has some of the best guitar chops in rock and roll history, and his \\"About Face\\" album remains the finest solo project any member of the band has yet produced ... including that of the mega-talented acid casualty Syd Barrett. <br /> <br />However, in all fairness and honesty, I must say \\"On An Island\\" is the single worst thing I have ever heard any of the Pink Floyd musicians do in his career. In fact, this record is embarrassingly bad. Let's start with the insipid lyrics. I know that singing about the albatross hanging \\"motionless upon the air\\" wasn't exactly a high point on \\"Echoes,\\" but what are we to make of lines like this? <br /> <br />\\"I'll make my getaway <br />Time on my own <br />Search for a better way <br />To find my way home to your smile.\\" <br /> <br />Or this from \\"Where We Start\\": <br /> <br />\\"I light a campfire away from the path. <br />We lie in the bluebells, a woodpecker laughs.\\" <br /> <br />Huh? I mean, seriously, WTF? A child of 10 could come up with better words than that. <br /> <br />Then we've got the, um, instrumental part of the record, which consists of a LOT of aimless guitar noodling and emotionally flat pseudo-orchestral self-indulgence. It's as if Gilmour is determined to submerge his gift for expressing simple melodies so that he can show off his knowledge of classical arrangements and motifs. Perhaps it's no coincidence that the only half-decent tunes on the whole album are \\"Take A Breath\\" and \\"This Heaven,\\" both of which benefit enormously from having Phil Manzanera on keyboards and piano, respectively. Heck, at least Manzanera supplies some of the much-needed texture this record otherwise entirely lacks. <br /> <br />Now, I don't know what the reviewers who give this record four or five stars have been smoking, but there is simply no way \\"On An Island\\" deserves even a semi-respectable three-star rating. And lest you suspect I am being too hard on Gilmour, let me just say that I generally respect artists who challenge their listeners and disregard their fan base to do something different. Whether it's Ray Charles releasing modern sounds in country music, or Cowboy Junkies experimenting with grunge, or even Bob Dylan going electric, there is much to be said for allowing a person the freedom to pursue his or her own vision. I don't dislike this work because it's a departure from a Pink Floyd concept album. It's more a matter of Gilmour's apparent contempt for his audience, or his essential laziness, that bothers me here. He's not even trying anymore. The entire track list may be exquisitely produced, but it's inconsequential stuff that comes across as the kind of canned spam he phoned in to meet a deadline or pay for a third house out in the country. <br /> <br />The young David Gilmour dabbled with psychedelics, played around with LSD and mushrooms, and helped create some of the most glorious space rock of his generation. Geez, he and his fellow Floydians practically pioneered a new genre of popular music. The old David Gilmour writes songs like a man whose idea of recreational drug use is limited to Maalox and Quaaludes, and who inspires nothing so much as a world-weary boredom and ennui with life and all it has to offer a multi-millionaire with way too much time on his hands.  <br /> <br />Sorry Dave, but if this is all you've got left, Roger Waters has nothing to worry about in his solo career.

1878424505|5.0|Some time in 1974 or '75 my older brother brought home a book by an author named Carlos Castenada.  Put simply, it changed the way I view the world.  And for 30 yrs. I have read and practiced, to the best of my ability, this 'new way'.  Call it Neo-Indianism or whatever, it makes no difference really.  Don Miguel Ruiz has re-opened a window to the beauty that I remember when I encountered Castenada.  As with all students I had questions but no one to ask.  Don Miguel has helped fill the void and answer many of my questions concerning the 'path with heart'.  This book, \\"The Four Agreements\\", is maybe the greatest outline for the practical knowledge necessary for the continuation on the path of knowledge.  If the premise of both authors is that personal power is 'all important' then it follows that we need to discover methods for saving personal energy.

B000002BQK|5.0|Mariah Carey-Butterfly <br /> <br />Before 1997 ever came around, Mariah Carey was known as the \\"ballad queen\\". From her debut album in 1990 to 1995's monstrous selling (her best selling album to date), Daydream, Mariah was known to produce catchy pop songs and generic love ballads.  <br /> <br />However, after her bitter divorce w/ Tommy Motolla, Mariah Carey took her first steps in her career process of emancipating. The album Butterfly took the world by surprise as Mariah no longer released catchy pop songs or generic love ballads. Instead, she worked with popular hip hop producers such as Diddy whom helped create some of the most memorable songs of her career. Butterfly was the obvious beginning of her continuous hip hop based albums. This album was also risky, as most of it is R&B slow jams and/or ballads. <br /> <br />Individual Track Review: <br /> <br />Honey-An exceptional hip hop track which opens this album very well. This is one of the best songs of her career. This single hit #1. Mariah becomes risqu and incorporates sexy lyrics throughout the song. The video was also memorable as she understood she had the freedom to become more revealing, and may I say...sexy! 10/10 <br /> <br />Butterfly-A memorable, classic Mariah Carey ballad. She sings about love that she hopes returns to her. Her vocals are flawless. 9/10 <br /> <br />My All-This was the second #1 single from this album. This song has a Spanish-Latino atmosphere which is created by using a Spanish acoustic guitar. As the song progresses, so does the vocals. Towards the last verse and chorus, Mariah bursts her classic high notes that make this song the memorable song that it is. 9/10 <br /> <br />The Fourth of July- Again, another classic Mariah ballad. She doesn't have to use consistent high notes to make a great ballad, as shown here. The song is great, and the melody is cheesy, yet fun. 9/10 <br /> <br />The Roof-Lyrics are amazing; however you can't decipher them through her low tone of whispery-vocals. However, the whispery vocals she uses does not annoy listeners as it would in her later albums to come... (Rainbow and Charmbracelet). The chorus is great, and catchy. An innovative hip hop flavored track. 8/10 <br /> <br />Breakdown-This is the best song on the album, if not the best song of her career. The way the lyrics are written and the way she progresses through this heartbreaking song just blows me away. The arrangement of the song couldn't have been better; the rap solos are unforgettable. 10/10 <br /> <br />Babydoll- Co-written by Missy Elliot. The song is a great R&B song that tells a story of Mariah waiting in a hotel room, waiting for a lover. The chorus is great, and the vocals are amazing. 8/10 <br /> <br />Close My Eyes-A song penned to reveal her troubled childhood. The theme will be used in her future works as well (Petals, and Sunflowers For Alfred Roy). The chorus is simple, yet depressing. A great listen. 10/10 <br /> <br />Whenever You Call-Mariah returns to her roots and sings a generic ballad that has made her memorable over the years. The song is great, and the vocals towards the middle and ending of the song are amazing. 9/10 <br /> <br />The Beautiful Ones-This is a cover on Prince's song. The song features Dru Hill who is nothing spectacular. The song actually comes across as filler, and is not slightly enjoyable. The instrumental setup is great though. 6/10 <br /> <br />Outside-An easily forgettable Mariah ballad. However, the lyrics are great. Not a great way to end of an exceptional album though. 6/10 <br /> <br />Overall Grade: 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Though this would equal 4 stars in average, I will have to bump it up to 5 stars due to the fact it's her most enjoyable album w/ the exception of two songs. `Breakdown' is my favorite Mariah single fro her career, and deserves a bonus &#61514; <br /> <br />Also check out these albums from Mariah: Daydream, Charmbracelet, and The Emancipation of Mimi. <br /> <br />Check out thesereleases by other artists: <br /> <br />Michael Jackson-Dangerous, Invincible, Bad, and Off The Wall <br />Janet Jackson-The Velvet Rope, All For You and Janet. <br />Whitney Houston-Whitney Houston and Whitney <br />Madonna-True Blue, Like a Prayer and Ray of Light <br />Alanis Morissette-Jagged Little Pill, Under Rug Swept, and So Called Chaos <br />Celine Dion-Falling Into You, Let's Talk About Love, and Colour of Love <br />Natasha Bedingfield-Unwritten <br /> <br />
B00005JOFO|5.0|Trying to state my feelings for this film as simply as I can so here goes: <br />Yes, \\"Crash\\" is a great film but \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" goes beyond mere strips of celluloid. It is quite simply a Masterpiece from it's first frame to it's last. It is not anything as trivial as THE gay cowboy movie. If anything it is about two bisexual men but it is so much more than that. I will probably get heaps of unhelpful votes for the following statements but that is fine. Last I heard America still had freedom of Speech so here goes; Brokeback Mountain lost the Best Picture Oscar because the voters were afraid of it's theme and because of political pressure. Remember, \\"Citizen Kane\\" lost Best Picture because of the pressure put on the academy from the Hearst regime back in the 1940's. Most people don't even remember what won that year but how many top ten lists does \\"Kane\\" still appear on over 60 years after it's release? \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" will go on to this type of cinematic glory...I'll stake my last breath on it.
B0006399FS|1.0|U2 are a plague on music and their latest should have been dismantled before it was launched.  There are no words to describe how bad this CD is without getting vulgar.  None of the songs should have been released to the public to destroy what was left of our auditory nerves.  Vertigo is like a plague that has spread across the land due to its use in those idiotic commercials and so all the sheep went and bought the CD just to spread this noise even more.  We need to innoculate ourselves so we don't get the disease so similar to radiation poisoning that is HTDAAB.  DOWN WITH U2 AND THIS CD!!!!!
B00092ZL80|5.0|I saw this tour live last summer and enjoyed it throughly. Probably one of the best bang for the buck concerts ever, with both bands having so many hits separately, and blending together so well. The DVD is great sound! If you like this check out Bill Champlin's original band, the Sons of Champlin \\"Secret\\" DVD, or their new \\"Hip Lil Dreams\\" CD. But if you get a chance go see the \\"real deal\\" live. There is a show in Portland on 4/15/06 with Lydia Pense and Cold Blood opening for the Sons.
B000BGR0OM|5.0|Eurythmics are an excellent pop group and dominated the mid 80's. They had three main strengths - Annie Lennox's terrific voice and unique, soulful personality , an advanced sense of melody , and their ability to develop as musicians and become more sophisticated as their career progressed. I always really liked them back in the 80's, and had the good fortune to see them in concert on 01/12/1989 here in Hobart on their We Too Are One tour. Here they are again with a second, updated hits package, and not surprisingly it's very a good CD.  <br /> <br />This compilation spans 1983 until the present day, and like most hits compilations it includes two new tracks to make the CD more enticing to casual and long-term fans alike. They're not going to set the charts ablaze, but both new songs are pretty good. <br /> <br />Always with such a successful group that has more than one CD -worth of hit tunes, you wonder whether a 2CD set would be better, but I'm satisfied with this as I'm sort of intending to purchase the group's back catalogue albums on CD anyway. In particular the remastered sound is excellent. My old CD of the Eurythmics 1985 album Be Yourself Tonight has much inferior sound on the loud, rocking #1 hit Would I Lie To You (which I love) when compared to the improved sound quality here.  <br /> <br />Favourite tracks ; Right By Your Side ( holiday /carnival vibe, lovely) , Would I Lie To You (brilliant rock vocal performance, ace guitar playing) , When Tomorrow Comes ( routine melody but lovely lyrics) , I Saved The World Today ( gorgeous melody, great singing) , Here Comes The Rain Again ( cool melancholy vocal , atmospheric instrumentals) , There Must Be An Angel ( Playing With My Heart) ( sweet vocals, terrific harmonica guest performance from Stevie Wonder), Miracle Of Love ( one of the best 80's radio ballad hits with lovely lyrics) .  <br /> <br />I hope newer listeners unfamiliar with this music might wish to try out this package of hit songs, all of whichare really good. <br />I would imagine however that most fans of this band would already own most of these tracks, so the only selling point then is the improved sound quality. <br /> <br />I 'm going to give this 5 stars because I like all the songs on this disc a lot. <br />
0679601686|4.0|I enjoyed reading this particular version of the epic \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" It is written in the form of a screenplay, leaving out most, if not all, of Jane Austin's  fine and abundant descriptions of the surroundings the characters find themselves in, as well as descriptions of the characters themselves.<br /><br />If the reader wants to get a quick idea of what this tale is about, I'd recommend this book. It is a quick read and yet does the story justice.
B000AP04OM|5.0|My family absolutely loves this DVD!  We watch it over and over, and the extras, besides the movie itself, are so great. <br /> <br />I would recommend this to everyone.
B00005BL2A|4.0|There were a few songs on the cd that i deleted from my file, but I kept the majority because they were really good songs.  Dave has a beautiful voice.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I dont know what to say, if you are a FF7 fan as well as a CGI fan this is your dream come true. It is truly an amazing piece of work and i would recommend it to absolutely anyone. If you havent seen it, SEE IT.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|It's amazing how Born to Run holds up.  After 30 years its still a testimony to the talent, power, and creativity of Bruce and the band.  The accompanying DVDs are a treat as well.  \\"Wings for Wheels\\" offers real insights into the production of this watershed moment in the Boss's career and certainly factored up my own appreciation of this album.  The Hammersmith Odeon concert is rare gift:  a peek back in time allowing us to be present at this landmark concert.  If you're a die-hard Bruce fan, buying this set is a requirement.  If you're not, buying this set will give you an insight into why Bruce Springsteen is one of the most revered performers (if not THE most) in the history of rock 'n' roll.
B00065JTBA|2.0|It seems that the guys in Bon Jovi actually have a taste in music.  Had they released much of the stuff on this box set as studio albums, they would have had a much shorter career than the 20+ years that they've been around.  I've always wondered why so many box sets were typically an overproduced greatest hits package, and now I know why they are.  90% of the tracks on this set are horrible.  Bon Jovi is a rock band, and yet this box set is made up of terrible ballad after ballad.  I'm afraid that this is one collection that will be collecting dust amongst my CDs after one very long and painful listening trying to find at least a few worthy tracks to listen to multiple times.  Most fans will be better off sticking to their true studio albums and leaving this set to hardcore fans.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Any film will flop without a good story to tell. Even great actors can not help a film with a weak storyline. This is what makes Master and Commander so compelling. Watch it repeatedly and  the chances are good you will get some meaningful new impression. Director Peter weir has seamlessly put together many sub plots against the background of the Napoleonic Wars at sea, and a deadly competition between a French and an English warship. Viewers learn of tense and tender relationships between officers, officers and enlisted men, and between the English Captain ( Russell Crowe ) and a civian naturalist ( Paul Bettany ). None of these fascinating stories overwhelm the principle story: wartime competition. The cast is truly fine, the settings are fascinating, battle scenes are not numerous, but are convincingly and ( sometimes ) wincingly staged and photographed. In my view, this film surpasses \\"Gladiator\\" for story and photography. The film's gifted story telling easily wins the audience, more than would gratuitous violence. Even the dvd extras are fine and informative. I have seen the dvd many times; I will view it again.
B00007AJF8|4.0|I am amazed at how clean that Kaufmans films are.  I mean they are really some very convuluted and jigsawed films...that consistently are flawless and so very, very watchable.  I love this movie.  Its so smart, so creative and yes, so original. <br /> <br />They performances are EXCELLENT, the music perfect and the direction delicate and precise.  Just a wonderful film that most have seen, but for those that have yet to, do yourself a favor and check it out.  It was like nothing I imagined and took me on a ride through the obscure I rarely like, but in this case fell in Love. <br /> <br />A great film, matching all the componets for a near perfect experience.
B000002ADT|5.0|Kind of Blue captures Miles Davis, one of the most influential jazz musicions of the time, at the peak of his creative talents.  If you are a jazz afficionado then you already know how important a milestone this album is and there is no need to read this review.  If you are just beginning to aprpeciate true jazz, as compared to the bland jazz played by the likes of Kenny G and heard in elevators, then this is a great album to add to your collection.  The music is easy to appreciate on a first listen and will reward you on subsequent listening as you pick up the subtle chord changes and mastery this captured. <br /> <br />If you are just starting to build a colelction of jazz greats this should be a cornerstone of your collection and would be well complemented by Coltrane's \\"Love Supreme,\\" Mingus's \\"Mingus Ah Um,\\" and Brubeck's \\"Time Out.\\"
B00003CXDB|5.0|Wall Street is a marvelous movie directed by Oliver Stone (JFK) and starring Michael Douglas (The War Of The Roses) in his only Oscar winning performance, Charlie Sheen (Scary Movie 3), Daryl Hannah (Kill Bill), and Martin Sheen (Catch Me If You Can). <br /> <br />Bud Fox, played by Charlie Sheen, is an ambitious stockbroker who wants to make the big time as a highroller. Gordon Gekko, played by Douglas, is Bud's idol and dream client. After a brief meeting with Gekko and an offer of buying the airline that his father, played by Martin Sheen, works for, Gekko takes young Bud under his wing, exposing him to the lifestyle of the rich and merciless and initiating him into the corrupt world of Wall Street.  <br /> <br />Nearly 20 years after its release, Wall Street remains to be a powerful film. What makes the movie so interesting is Douglas's convincing performance as a man who's got it all and has lost all sense of morality.  <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />A
6305949980|5.0|Ok for those reading this, this movie is a work of art literally. If you know anything about stop motion movies or art work, this is a beautiful movie. This DVD is a must buy if you want to have the inside scoop on how the movie was made, 2 movies never before seen that were created by Tim Burton and just a wonderful DVD. The special edition contains all those things mentioned above and the cover is very cool. Nice gold design etc,. I personally loved it! So go and press \\"Add to Shopping Cart\\" and get it over with, you won't regret it.

B000002UAX|5.0|The Beatles White Album is one of the best albums of all time, <br />    Johns voice on Dear Prudence , Julia, is worth the money alone. <br />  This album stands out today as it did in 1968. To all Beatle fans and new ones , this is a must have for your collection.. <br />   Rick Anderson.
B000003TA4|2.0|This album is the most overrated object probably ever. It isn't the worst, just given credit where it isn't do. David Grohl was a good drummer but he is nowhere close to the level of Neil Peart. Krist is mediocre at bass. But the essence of which this album becomes overrated is Kurt Cobain. The mass following of this person has given him an illusion of perfection. He was terrible at playing guitar, and even worse at singing. But mostly he is given credit for sonwriting. Breifly examining the songs we notice \\"Polly\\" and \\"Lithium\\" are basically the same riff. \\"Come As YOU Are\\", one of the most noteworthy songs on this record, is known for a riff that a band called Killing Joke already used. The so-called amazing songwriting that \\"defined\\" Cobain, starts with \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", probably the worst track on the album. Four power chords and two notes any fledgling gutiarist could muster. The solo is slow and encompasses about 8 notes. \\"In Bloom\\" follows basically the same with a solo based slowly off the vocals, as does \\"Come As You Are\\". \\"Breed\\" is much better than the first three and the next two. After \\"Lithium\\" and \\"Polly\\" we enter a son called \\"terretorial Pissings\\" which is just a rip-off of \\"Breed\\". We then reach the best song on the album \\"Drain You\\", which is the only song on the album that dpesn't make use of stupid lyrics. The rest of the album is okay, but essientally they are just repeats of others. <br />The lyrics on the album usually are nonsense, though there are a few exceptions, mostly \\"TP\\". <br />The final overrated part of the album is it's \\"Impact\\". <br />Everyone assumes one day everyone was lsitening to Madonna, and SLTS came on the radio and everyone was wearing flannel the next day. We know it was 1992 when they hit it big. Four years earlier in 1988 R.E.M. hit it big with \\"it's the end of the world as we know it\\" and Jane's Addiction was nominated for a Grammy. In 1990 <br />GN'R was wearing flannel, and Alice In Chains was releasing there best known song \\"Man In The Box\\". Red Hot Chili Peppers were already popular and then finally SLTS became a hit. Two months later Pearl Jam became more popular then Nirvana. But they quit releasing MTV videos. Two years later Kurt Cobain is dead and MTV milks it for what it's worth. So in the end we see a mediocre album that is repetitive and used as sympathy for a dead man. Not much at all. <br />Is buying this record worth. Strangely yes, after you buy PJ, AIC, Soundgarden, and the other bands I have mentioned. The reason being is the same with a much more influential album \\"Appetite for Destruction\\", you aren't going to hear the fine points of the album on the radio. <br />PS They did borrow heavily from the Pixies, so buy \\"Doolittle\\" before this.
B0000542D2|5.0|I rember seeing this film when it came out, i watched it again the other day for must be my  50th time.  And i still get goose bumps like i did back in the 1964. The music to this film is wonderful, and the Beatles are as smart and witty as ever. <br />   It is just a Great film to sit back and take it easy, and listen to some of the best music you will ever hear.  <br />  Rick Anderson  <br /> <br />   <br />
B000AMPZGC|5.0|after hearing the songs all cut up on the film the originals will be a relief. the opening is definitally setting the opening for the following song \\"According to Plan\\". all the songs just add to the mood of the film especially the jazzy showstopper \\"Remains of the day\\".
B00004XPPK|5.0|I am in my 50's and was born and raised in the '50s.  My father used to tell me that, in the '40s, he had \\"fallen in love\\" with the actress Rita Hayworth from watching her movies.  I didn't get it.<br /><br />Flash forward to the new millenium.  In David Lynch's enigmatic and erotic masterpiece \\"Mulholland Drive\\", a beautiful brunette amnesiac sees a movie poster of \\"Gilda\\", starring Rita Hayworth, on a bathroom wall and spontaneously takes the name \\"Rita\\" for herself.  Why?  Was there any significance or meaning in that choice of movie posters?...that choice of names?  You bet your sweet sex goddess there was!<br /><br />David Lynch knew what my father knew: Rita Hayworth was a hottie to men returning  from World War II, and in \\"Gilda\\", it is captured for all time.  Now I get it.  Gilda is what did it.  A \\"wild child\\" before the term was coined, Rita Hayworth radiates like a Chernobyl of sensuality.<br /><br />See this movie and you'll find out what your grandfather, your father, David Lynch, and I found out!

0307263118|5.0|Let's see, what have we here? This little book seems to have caused quite a stir, I suppose because of its winning the Man Booker.  On the one side, we have those agreeing with New York Times Ubercritic, Ms Kachutani, who penned a searing review, accusing the writer of \\"navel-gazing\\" and the committee's passing over of a \\"more vibrant\\" novel.  On the other hand, it seems to me, we have lovers of the English language and lyrical writing. And, somewhere along the way, someone writing for The Daily Telegraph in England has compared Banville to Nabokov. I suppose I'll just weigh in on what I think of this conflict, briefly, and then give my own impressions.<br /><br />First off, this Nabokov thing:  I don't know who started it, but it really won't do. The two writers are at opposite poles of the writing sphere, and this book is the last place for a Nabokov devotee to waste his/her time trying to find him resurrected. As for Ms Kachutani's, remarks, they only add clearer evidence to what Harold Bloom stated years ago; to wit, that The New York Times is becoming the most unliterary paper in the nation. \\"Vibrant\\", trendy novels are all good and well, but, in the end, almost always ephemeral and remaindered and forgotten in the span of hardly any time at all. Great lyrical writings are the treasures of our culture and deserve to be rewarded whenever possible; they are our language's true inheritance and will be treasured by lovers of the language for years.....Banville's novel is such a work.<br /><br />Preliminaries out of the way, the book reminded me, from the start, of the work of Sir Thomas Browne, whom Banville obviously borrowed from, and whose character, Max, mentions once. His work is replete with words that will leave even the most erudite running to their unabridged OEDs on nearly every page, and whose work is filled with such apothegms as, \\"This world has always seemed to me a hospital.\\" The similarities are unmistakable. - Also, of course, Proust - Proust is really the artist that The Daily Telegraph writer should have mentioned as Banville's literary forbear.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is an odd little book, and needs to be read several times to be appreciated fully.  What I mean is, after we learn the basic surface facts of the mystery that are finally divulged to us in the last few pages then yes, that's resolved. But the greater mystery of the book and the subject it tackles, the human condition, remain muddled.  From the time he \\"walked into the sea\\" when his wife died, and immediately sunk in his \\"bathysphere\\", a suit for diving into the deepest part of the ocean for underwater observation, to the ending, we get a beautiful, skewed view of life, love, and memory.  What of these deeper mysteries? I, for one, truly don't know, and I don't think Banville does either. But I feel that each time I reread this book I'm closer to some sort of clearer resolution on the subject, at least as seen by Max.  This focus on the depths and ability to bring out in us the compulsion to reread is to my mind, part of qualifying for the laurel of great literature, a test which Max and his \\"bathyspheric\\" observations pass easily.  There is a part of me that wishes Banville had expanded a bit more and made the novel longer.  But, as Max says, early in the book, quoting Valery, \\"there is no finishing of a work, only the abandoning of it.\\" Lovers of literature will find themselves unable to abandon this work for some time.s really the artist that The Daily Telegraph writer should have mentioned as Banville's literary forbear. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, this is an odd little book, and needs to be read several times to be appreciated fully.

B0000AI45P|5.0|When you say \\"punk\\" to the average person now, they conjure up images of the Sex Pistols, the Ramones(perhaps), some hardcore, and quite possibly even Green Day. But it really started out as so much more.... and this album proves it.(no pun intended) This is an exercise in hearing ART. This is where we were hoping  music could take us, and if you were a \\"thinking youth\\" in 1977, believe me, music needed to go somewhere. How refreshing for my young ears to hear this instead of \\"Hotel California\\" that was being played ad nauseum on the radio. There was suddenly a light at the end of the tunnel. And what a light this was. This was part of the movement that brought us Patti Smith, Blondie, the Ramones, the Talking Heads, and the Voidoids, just to name a few. Think about that diversity. Now merge that with the Sex Pistols, the Clash, the Damned, the Vibrators, and most of the talent from the \\"Stiff\\" label from England and you have some idea of the broad scope of punk at that time. (Then they started to divide it all for marketing purposes - \\"New Wave\\", \\"New Romantic\\", \\"Art Punk\\", \\"Hardcore\\", \\"Post Punk\\", \\"West Coast\\", \\"East Coast\\", blah blah blah.) This album opens your eyes to what it is possible to get out of your guitar. It is an album of contrasts- smooth, liquid guitar paired with an abrupt rhythm section; military sounding drums with guitars and bass curling around them, lapping at the beats like flames; staccato guitars and a jazzy drumline- all with Tom Verlaine's unmistakable vocals layered throughout. The original album is reproduced here quite nicely, and dare I say it? -better audio integrity than my original cd or even my original vinyl copy, & just as warm. But the extra bonus of \\"Little Johnny Jewel\\" is an awesome addition- now you don't have to scour used record stores for the seven inch. This is an fantastic reissue of a fantastic album.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This was my first Coldplay albulm and it completly blew my mind.  talk about some trippy interesting music.

B00003CXAW|5.0|THIS is how King Kong is meant to be.  Peter Jackson missed the crux of the story so you're wasting your time with his reeeeaaalllly long version of it.  Sure the dialog is a little stilted and dated but the moment when Kong sees Ann Darrow is when you are hooked.  Even with the stop motion puppet you can tell that the Ape is taken with her, something Jackson ignores.  Check out this movie.  Even after all these years it's still worth watching.

By an hour in, I had given up and was wondering who to give it to.  Someone who will appreciate the incredible imagery but not notice the minor little detail that this movie is BOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRING!!!!! <br /> <br />There are some excellent sequences, but it seems that the film was done in the \\"Now What Oddball Idea Can We Put Here?\\" school of cinema.  It is disjointed and maundering, and proof that it is possible for a film to be TOO much like real dreams.
0307276902|4.0|A Million Little Pieces by James Frey is an insightful, descriptive story about a mans grueling experience with addictions. Portrayed as real experiences with some fabricated key parts, Frey's A Million Littler Pieces is the story of his life. Despite the non-fiction, or lack of in this book the basic emotions he presents are real. His struggles and attempts to cope with cravings are very much relatable with everyone who has been in that situation. All the events in the book might of not happened to Frey as he wrote it, but could very much be true to anyone else. His sentences, stanzas, and the way he uses repetitive words is key to capture readers into Frey's warped mental state of mind. This created me to linger on the hook of the chain of repeating words, long enough to understand and analyze the importance of each one. <br /> <br />I think the most common misconception of this book, is that it's all about him doing a bunch of notorious drugs. This is not true. The opening of the book focuses on James confusion on how he got where he was, and what were the previous events that lead him there. Throughout the novel, we slowly learn his whereabouts of his past through him reminiscing about the earlier years. It's quite easy to read James feelings, but Frey gives no simple, one answer explanation to addictions, or why they start, and how to conquer it. The book outlines James life in rehab and his struggles with himself, and others around him. It shows the reader how powerful dependence on a substance can be, and how it can tear someone's life apart. <br /> <br />In the end, just as I expected, there is no fairy tale endings. After the story ends, there's a list of character names, with their outcome. This captures the realism of everything when it shows readers that despite rehab, many relapse, and die. A Million Little Pieces doesn't preach to not use drugs, nor dose it glorify drug use. It simply states the possibilities drugs can have on ones life, and leaves readers to decide for themselves if it's all worth it or not. This book wont be as satisfying to everyone. But for someone who has seen or dealt with cravings, and lack of self control with anything, you can see a part of yourself in James. And because of that I couldn't help myself but cross my fingers, and hope that James will be fine in the end.
B00005JLPK|5.0|Frida couldn't have asked for a more beautiful film about her life then Taymor's. Every scene is filled with beauty, color, and life. It begins with Frida in her bed being caried through the streets, where we don't know where.<br /><br /> There are some scenes in Frida that take my breath away. Its isn't done traditionally like biotopic movies are.
B0000035E7|4.0|This is the first Nirvana CD - before they hit it big (with different band members). <br />I love it - as it has a raw, rough, gritty and energetic feel to it.  I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes Nirvana and/or the \\"Seattle\\" sound.
B0006399FS|5.0|One of my favorite U2 albums since the \\"Joshua Tree\\".  Very powerful, moving music.
B000003TAB|3.0|There are some awesome cuts on this cd and some cuts that are just ok.  Still, it is a must to own for any Nirvana fan.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Two superb performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon make the bio-pic of Johnny Cash `Walk the Line' a highly engaging and absorbing drama about him and his love June Carter. Without two leads, the film might have become a shallow melodrama about music and love that you have seen on screen many times before. As it is, in spite of the weak supporting roles and several mistakes that betray the not-so-sure hand of the director James Mangold (`Girl, Interrupted'), 'Walk the Line' is a moving story about Johnny Cash and June Carter. <br /> <br />Though the film is full of great Johnny Cash songs, `Walk the Line' is more about the long-time romance of a gifted musician, and like any romance with gifted musician, it is full of romance and emotional turmoil. The film begins with the tragic event that happened in the childhood of the artist (like `Ray'), but the real film starts when we meet Reese Witherspoon as June Carter, whose less restrained and moralistic attitude to life than that of his wife inevitably attract Johnny Cash. <br /> <br />Johnny Cash songs sometimes reveal the troubled soul of sinner or criminal with the darkly engaging lyrics. Credible acting from Joaquin Phoenix and several episodes depicted in the film explain the reason for this darker nature of his songs, but still many things are left out. While his distant father (Robert Patrick) convincingly shows the reason for the guilt-ridden mind seen in his songs and himself, supporting characters like his mother, his first wife, and his children are relegated to near ciphers. Still the strong performance from Reese Witherspoon compensates for the occasional slack in the script. <br /> <br />As a fan of oldies, it is good to see the legendary artists of Sun Label such as Jerry Lee Lewis or Roy Orbison again even though they are played by someone else. The director somehow thought that to cast real singers are a better idea than to cast actors, and we see Waylon Malloy Payne and Jonathan Rice as Lewis and Orbison. I know this is only a small flaw, but I wish for my favorite musicians' roles someone who really looks like them. <br /> <br />But essentially `Walk the Line' is a film for Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, both perfectly in character as Johnny and June. It is hard not to be moved by the conclusion and the energetic soundtrack of Johnny Cash numbers with thumping guitar riff.
B000001EYO|4.0|I was impressed by the range and mix of music in the Big Lebowski soundtrack.  I have found myself drawn more and more to soundtrack albums versus single-artist albums in the last few years.  This one is a keeper.

0316172324|3.0|Malcolm Gladwell does a good job of introducing and defending decision making based on quick deductions and first impressions.  However, I found his examples to be needlessly racially biased--to the point I felt I was in a community college SOC 101 class.  It could have been more entertaining, and less preachy.
B000EGDC14|5.0|Um, DAMN. I really enjoyed Goldfrapp's 1st album, Felt Mountain, which was ballsy in its baroque string arrangements, Alison's Shirley Bassey delivery, and its utter lack of caring whether or not it could be danced to.  This is MUCH less innovative. So why do I love it so?  It's one of the few albums in my entire collection that I could easily put on at a party and not ONE person would hate it, or want to change the disc.  The last time that happened was probably Blowback by Alison's old friend Tricky.  Anyone who buys a lot of electronic music knows this dilemma--YOU know how cool the album you just bought is, but people less cool than you think it sounds like Depeche Mode on ketamine. With Supernature, bliss will abound.<br /><br />This is certainly one of the poppiest things I own, and yet also a satisfying, joyous, sexy listen, with NO WEAK TRACKS.  The videos on the DVD are utterly worth it; Alison has developed an amazing stage presence and a totally playful and ironic way to project her sexuality. She's a dreamy and somewhat geeky sex symbol for smart boys. If you're straight, male, and have an IQ over 120, you WILL SWOON. You have been warned.<br /><br />Perfect for fans of any form of contemporary or retro electronic music, provided their sense of fun outweighs the degree to which they take anything seriously.  This is the sexiest, most debauched thing I've bought in, well, EVER.

B0001CCXY8|5.0|Cannibal Corpse was a very risque band when i first heard them. i was watching Ace Ventura, and i saw this death metal band playing a kickass song, and i found out it was cannibal corpse. i went online and found the lyrics for the song \\"hammer smashed face\\", the song in the movie. i was only 12 at the time, and the lyics actually scared me to death.  <br /> <br />over time, i listend to mix cd's my friends had, which had some C.C. thrown in. i was starting to enjoy them more and more every day. in early 2004, i bought \\"The Wretched Spawn\\" and it is a D.M masterpiece in my eyes. Jack and Pat are guitar wizards, they can play at around 200 something BPM without missing a note, Alex is THE best bassist i have heard since i started listening to metal, Paul is crazy on the drums with his double bass assaults, and snare attacks, and finally, George's growls add a flair of death in the music.  <br /> <br />The album highlights are Frantic Disembowlment, Slain, Festering in the Crpypt, and Severed Head Stoning. every song is good, but these ones take the cake. <br /> <br />the music is much more diverse in this album, and the bonus DVD has a few laughs in it as well. (listen to Jack play \\"My pockets got a hole in it\\"). but all in all, this album is a must have for either C.C. fans, or D.M heads. (not to mention that the album's cover art is totally badass!!!) <br /> <br />Take twenty dollars out of your wallet, and go buy this album for god's sake!!!!!!!!!!
B000BCKFWK|4.0|Well I enjoyed it but it was sort of spooky if you know what i mean. Anyway I highly recommend it
B000009CEM|4.0|Not much to say about obsolete. demanufacture is smarter, heavier, and catchier. soul of a new machine/concrete (i prefer to lump them together) is MUCH heavier with a death metal edge. archetype has the best grooves and shows just how big an influence this incredibly underrated band is on modern 'metalcore' or whatever genre label they like to put on bands like lamb of god, shadows fall, and between the buried and me nowadays. <br /> <br />unfortunetly, obsolete is not a must-have. if anything, i'd rate it my 3rd favorite FF album (i am yet to hear digimortal...but i dont exactly have high hopes for it). <br /> <br />however, it is still worth buying if youre a fan, and is a decent place to start if you're looking into this band. <br /> <br />shock is an amazing opener with amazing drum work (the norm for FF), edgecrusher...well its definetly commercial and all, but really...what's the big problem? it'll get caught in your head, and they didn't sell out BECAUSE of this song. smasher/devourer has a good melodic/scream ratio, and a killer outro. securitron passes by sort of fast, but has a great chorus. <br /> <br />descent is easily my favorite track on the cd. why, you ask? its the best handled melodic rocker fear factory ever did. the chorus is, to put it lightly, beautiful, and the rest of the song is excellent. high-tech hate is the heaviest on the cd, with a near-blastbeat in portions (FF's blastbeats are like machine guns...but better). freedom or fire is rather techno-ey...drum-wise, at least, and it shouldn't be frowned upon for any reason. obsolete is my second favorite-very heavy, moves fast, \\"MAN IS OBSOLETE\\" replete with thrash pattern easily makes this song worth it. <br /> <br />resurection is easily the biggest departure FF had done up to this time. melodic, ballady...oh wait. then it gets heavy. it retains its emotional impact, however. timelessness is the big departure here-strings and all, its a BIG departure. (once you listen to transgression, however, you'll think FF is departing from their beaten path just to say they've done it) <br /> <br />should you buy it? if you're a fan, there's no reason not to. if you're new to fear factory, try demanufacture, or if you can't find it, archetype. new to metal? eh...either or of demanufacture/archetype (but DEFINETLY not soul or concrete...the brutality of those two frightens even me sometimes). <br /> <br />peace
B00004RF9B|5.0|As Carl Jung once wrote it is not as much as exploring cosmic space that will bring us closer to the real knowledge but more specifically the inner exploration of man itself.  A masterpiece movie that has been greatly underrated and was/remain a strong inspiration for SF movies like Star Trek - especially for the pilot episode. Too bad todays SF movies lack the powerfull sense of mystery that establishes FORBIDDEN PLANET as a landmark.

B00006FM77|5.0|Growing up, one of the first records I ever bought was Chicago V. It blew me away & still does. I continued buying all of their albums till the death of Terry Kath altered their sound. Remarkable moments in the history of rock! However one recording I never did hear was the \\"Live at Carnegie\\" sessions. A sample listen on Amazon convinced me to pay this one a visit. What a treat!! Like old friends they brighten up your life. The repertoire is excellent, along with the sound quality. The only tweak I might make would be to eliminate the 4th \\"bonus disc\\" only because the first three are so satisfying. Highly recommended to original Chicago purists!
B00008AWOD|4.0|Generally I stick with what I know well, that being classical and uncompromising extreme metal, but this CD has been a guilty pleasure of mine. \\"Sleeping With Ghost\\" is a rich tapistry of interwoven, unique sonic textures. Usually I enjoy extremely techinque music because I appriecate listening to good musicians but a CD like this shows how not being overtly complex can be a good thing, but oh, this CD is very complex. While listening to this, one transends through several layers of aural delights that make this in of its self complex. If everything didn't seem to fit so good together I would have hated this CD, but it all fits precisely together like a sonic jigsaw puzzle.

B000002U82|5.0|Of course I give this 5 stars because I'm 50 years old.  Like the beatles, this music definded a generation.  I must say, however, that I understand the one star reviews from will and kid.  My son could not sit down long enough to get through the first song to enjoy it. Any movie that I have taken him to that has more than 1 minute of dialogue without action, he says \\"I'm bored\\".  I actually like the new bands, but I noticed that slow songs are not in their repetoire. In this day of instant gratification, video game reality and blink 182 tempo music; organic, slow moving music like dark side is dull. So don't waste your money unless you are willing to up your dose of ritilin, or experiment with some of the drugs that were popular when dark side was released. I do not recommend if for anyone under 20.
1591391105|5.0|This book is the only one I found of its kind. It is a good reading to develop a structure before taking on a new role -and makes you consider some elements that I would not have immediately thought of. I did mix it with an online search that gave me the best format for the 90-day plan as I really wanted a one-pager. The only lack of this book is that best practice example.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|I have been a Gilmour fan since 1971 when I bought Ummagumma. On an Island is a good solo effort, but I can't say it's his best. I love the guitar solo on &#34;the blue&#34;. Gilmour has always been a lead break innovator and here he has taken it to a new level. Just beautiful and haunting.  In response to the Waters fans, (slipin sliding, etc), the best PF songs were mostly chord progressions created by Gilmour! Comfortably numb, Run like hell, Time, Us and them (Wright)... Waters would be nowhere without his bandmates (and his solo efforts bear that out. Waters is a great poet, NOT a great musician.)
0767834739|2.0|Resident Evil 2 has much of the same qualities as the first film did.  For instance, both films cut right into the story with little background, and the two films end just as precipitously. <br /> <br />However, there are some differences to be sure.  For instance, while in the first film the zombies are restricted to Umbrella Corp.'s compound, in the second these mutants overwhelm all of Raccoon City.  In addition, while the first focused on twisting plot development, with little truly exciting action, the second tries to, somewhat successfully, turn this around with the main characters fighting the mutants from the start. <br /> <br />Oh yeah, also while at the end of the first film, we see a guy ripped away to be used for some experiment and we the audience actually are upset; but, in the second film the tenderness for this man-turned-mutant is never developed enough for us to care, and I mean at all. <br /> <br />Other then that, the two really are just the same poor fare.  Both of which clearly made for, or from, the video game realm, because the story translates poorly to film form.  Why?  Basic action, basic characters, and a complex plot that's going to be dragged out for not one, not two, not three, but four films!!!  You could make one film, or just read some short story, that gives the same entertainment that these films do.  Oh well though, I am only a reviewer and regrettably cannot actually tell directors what to make and what not to make.  (It's probably better this way)
1853104825|5.0|I found the book one of the most interesting page turners ever and read it a second time right after the first. My only reservation is related with some of the comments concerning the shipping industry which are just about out of date so to speak and need to be slightly revised. I come from a seafaring career, followed by long safety and training-related shore positions with very respectable ship managing companies and am a holder of a JAR-FCL PPL(A) so I feel I can be allowed a little credit to a humble opinion. A word of warning: Read the book even if you might never want to fly again after that.
0060007737|5.0|Below please find the 22 Laws of Branding (and short elaboration)for your quick reference:-<br /><br />1. Expansion: The power of a brand is inversely proportional to its scope<br /><br />2. Contraction: A brand becomes stronger when you narrow its focus<br /><br />3. Publicity: The birth of a brand is achieved with publicity, not advertising<br /><br />4. Advertising: Once born, a brand needs advertising to stay healthy<br /><br />5.The Word: A brand should strive to own a word in the mind of the consumer<br /><br />6.Credentials: The crucial ingredient in the success of any brand is its claim to authenticity<br /><br />7. Quality: Quality is important, but brands are not built on quality alone<br /><br />8. The Category: A leading brand should promote the cateogry, not the brand<br /><br />9. The Name: In the long run a brand is nothing more htan a name.<br /><br />10. Extensions: The easiest way to destroy a brand is to put its name on everything<br /><br />11. Fellowship: In order to build the category, a brand should welcome other brands<br /><br />12. The Generic: One of the fastest routes to failure is giving a brand a generic name<br /><br />13. The Company: Brands are brands. Companies are companies. There is a difference<br /><br />14. Subbrands:  What branding builds, subbranding can destroy<br /><br />15. Siblings: There is a time and a place to launch a second brand<br /><br />16. Shape: A brand's logotype should be designed to fit the eyes. Both eyes.<br /><br />17. Color: A brand should use a color that is the opposite of its major competitor's<br /><br />18. Borders: There are no barriers to global branding. A brand should know no borders.<br /><br />19. Consistency: A brand is not built overnight. Success is measured in decades, not years.<br /><br />20. Change: Brands can be changed, but only infrequently and only very carefully<br /><br />21. Mortality: No brand will live forever. Euthanasia is often the best solution<br /><br />22. Singularity: The most important aspect of a brand is its single-mindedness<br /><br />If you feel fine with the above statements, I assure you that you will enjoy the book much with its smooth writing style and plenty of real life examples/graphs (and that trigger you to think of many counter examples, too, as stated by many reviewers already).

0312857063|5.0|I enjoyed this book because of the way, from chapter to chapter; Goodkind switched from character to character allowing you to see different aspects of the story. I also liked the underlying messages littering his book about human nature, and his insights into the nature of death and life. One more thing, Mr. Goodkind had going for him is, when he switched characters, he always left the last character you read about in a suspenseful situation making you almost need to read the next chapter so you could see what happened. Mr. Goodkind, though he had many strengths, had one major weakness.  I did not like that when he changed characters he sometimes dropped the pace, having completely changed situations, meaning the reader gets excited about one character or situation followed by almost instantaneous boredom at the dead drop in action. All in all I would strongly recommend this book for the writer's mastery of suspense.
B00002E23E|1.0|I'm embarrassed that I enjoyed this when it was first released.  This is painful to watch.  The sight of Robert Plant twirling his finger up by his head is indelibly etched in my brain and has turned me from a Zep fanatic to Zep detractor.  Only redeeming quality of the video is Bonham's playing

0790729350|3.0|The original theatrical cut was life changing and I really enjoyed viewing this directors cut when it was released in theaters but this 1994 Warners Directors Cut Dvd transfer is a disappointment over all. While it is a thrill to have the additional 40 minutes of footage (the original cut flows much better but who doesn't want more footage?!) to my ears the sound mix of this Dvd is sub-par. Much of the music sounds as if it were recorded in an ice hockey rink, lacking definition and clarity. It's as if you are having the audio experience of someone sitting somewhere in the cheap seats while viewing up close.<br /><br />This documentary should have received the same great treatment that the \\"Complete Monterey Pop Festival\\" Dvd set received, like the superior sound (as if you were right up on the stage), bonus discs and extra features. There is still plenty of great footage (that has yet to make it to Dvd) that could have been added as a bonus. Instead, the extras include laughable sub-titles and an advertisement(!) titled Film Flash. There is no commentary either. Another minor quibble, at the end of this edition they have a tribute to people from the \\"Woodstock Generation\\" who have passed. Very nice gesture except Canned Heat's Alan C.(Christie)Wilson's name was misspelled as \\"Alan G. Wilson\\" (What can I say? I'm a huge fan of the Blind Owl).<br /><br />I feel that this project should have been treated with more respect. After all, it is a significant historical document. The music, minus the sound quality and some bad edits, gets a 5 star rating. Not always technically on but very spiritually on. The project execution as a whole gets 2 stars, as it's fairly bare bones. I must say that I am still grateful to own this Dvd. It is Woodstock, after all. Maybe the powers that be will try and fix it up again in 2009 for the 40th anniversary and it will be so good that we'll all have to buy it again, one more time.
B000059XUO|5.0|This is one of those movies that rarely come along that gets the cult status it deserves as well as  avoiding the camp that comes with such a moniker.<br /><br />The dark scenes, the comic bad guys, the devils night to end all. It's all sewn together with some very above bar acting and an absolutely perfect soundtrack.<br /><br />Dust this one off, drop it in and take a little time to remember a really good flick. Better still if it's raining. Can't rain all the time.
B0000C2IQD|5.0|One mark of a Classic is its high replayability (and with our young kids, we've fulfilled many replay requests for this show). It's colorful, musical adventurous entertainment, fully appropriate for the kiddies that never fails to delight.    In fact, though we viewed the Full Screen release a zillion times, this Wide Screen version brought scenes so vividly out of the set that it was almost like experiencing a new movie!  You'll see  more singing dancers in the musical numbers, more beautiful, colorful panoramas in the outdoor scenes, and more costumed extras in the crowd scenes.  But the main thing I'd been missing in Standard are in Professor Potts' lab.  The television projection machine actually looks like one, and there are some other inventions I hadn't seen at all till now.    ** Note: Careful! * *   I see that this review loads under both the Full Screen Edition and the Widescreen Edition.  My recommendation applies to the Widescreen.  On the Full Screen, you're missing out on some great, unwasted elements the director saw fit to stick in each frame for you to enjoy.

Even if you had never seen the series, the movie was great by itself but if you had followed the series. it help complete the illusion. <br /> <br />One of the best parts was having the original cast back as it made the continuation of the story line more complete <br /> <br />A must see for anyone but especially sci-fi fanatics.
B000E5N62U|5.0|According to Morphy's Law, anything that can go right, will.  <br /> <br />With Morph the Cat, Donald Fagen continues with the momentum of  Steely Dan`s recent reactivation, this time, with another outstanding solo release--his third, and first since 1993's Kamakiriad. <br /> <br />Will anyone who's not already familiar with the work of Fagen--by himself, and with Walter Becker, of Steely Dan's significant contribution to  recorded music--use this album as an introduction to his work? I suspect not. But I still hope so: this member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is there rightfully, and Morph the Cat offers corroborating evidence for the justice of his selection. <br /> <br />Surprises? Few.  Some--here, and elsewhere--have bemoaned a manner of predictability observed in this recording.  I'd offer--as a decades-long and dedicated fan of Donald and Walter, apart and separately--that predictability is a right fine thing.  Now in his late 50s, Donald Fagen has his manner of craft dialed in. <br /> <br />What to expect? (for those who don't already know?) Songcraft that reveals a deep fondness for the pop songform; an unusual gift for melody; textured horn and backing vocal arrangements; and a lyrical wit dryer than hot laundry lint. <br /> <br />Personal highpoints include: <br /> <br />The absolutely lovely and heartfelt tip of the hat the recently-passed Ray Charles: a blues verse that breaks free of the 12-bar format for the chorus, Fagen seems to give some due thanks as he works his way through a continued need to self-efface; <br /> <br />A tip of hat to same absolutely chilling and gorgeous harmonica by Howard Levy--it presents surprising and elegant flourishes; <br /> <br />American culture has not comfortably made a place for death. Fagen, though, dresses him in white in Brite Nitegown, offers three vignettes of passing on, and sets it to a manner of funky bump shuffle that few besides Fagen are capable of.  Healthy. Fun. Genius.  <br /> <br />Without namingany specific presidents that any of us may or may not have voted for, In Mary Shut the Garden Door, Fagen paints an image of individual choices and behaviors in response to the political and social climate we now find ourselves in.  To me, this is a terribly sad, powerful piece.  <br /> <br />Fortunately, the album wraps with a reprise of the title track to shift the mood from what would have other wise been a somber emotional conclusion.  While this native New Englander and lifelong Red Sox fan will have a very hard time singing along to Lyrics that include \\"Blessed Yankees,\\" I'm grateful for this reprise. For the melody. For the return to the top.  <br /> <br />I am among those who see every Dan and solo project release as a gift, knowing faithfully that it will not stray from principles of songwriting and production excellence that the track record has established. I'll refrain from making comparisons from Morph the Cat to other works (solo or as Steely Dan). Fellow  dedicated fans will find their own moments of recollection, similarity, and connection.  I can say, without naming titles,  that I absolutely detect harmonic, rhythmic, and thematic ties that bind this work within an evolutionary path that includes Donald Fagen's work as a solo artist and as a member of Steely Dan.  Morph the Cat sits very comfortably alongside and among a well-established body of work.

B000002WPI|5.0|this is my fav. hip hop album of all time period. i wont say its the best, but its definitely one of em.. i first listened to this album in 1994 [i was out of the country from 92-94] i was completely blown away as were millions of others.. just pure perfection. lyrics at the time blew away most of other emcees and the production of RZA was so dope that you wanted to punch somebody..lol not a single 'filler' or a bad track on the album every single track is dope on its own. innovators of many things, wu was also one of the few that made tracks without any hooks and make it work  ie. the first single 'protect ya neck', '7th chamber' and this continues on their future efforts as well [triumph, the first single off their 2nd album 'forever' had no hooks] theres too much to say about this album so i'll stop here. if you havent heard it, i strongly recommend it, as its truly a hip hop masterpiece.

Personally, I love this CD but I'm not going to go \\"OMG 15/10 every song\\" and if this was a CD I didn't like I wouldn't just put \\"OMG this suxs.\\" Please, people, give some reasons and don't oveexagerate things. <br /> <br />Now, about the CD. Panic! At The Disco is a very good band. In some ways they do sound a lot like Fall Out Boy. But I think the singer for P!ATD is better and while some parts of songs remind me of Fall Out Boy there are some definite differences. P!ATD is a lot more catchy, and there is a lot of different sounds while Fall Out Boy is best with lyrics and has a lot of similar sounding songs. I did notice how similar the song titles were, but I think that's the new trend, \\"OMG let's make song titles that are way too long so that everybody shortens them.\\" <br /> <br />1. Introduction- 7/10 <br />Actually, for an introduction, it isn't that bad, but I'm not much of a fan of them and the fact that this really isn't much music but mostly static kind of bugs me. I do like the song clips they have, anyway. <br /> <br />2. The Only Difference- 8/10 <br />I do like this song quite a bit. It's not as catchy as some of the other ones. One thing about it sit that while at first it's not majorly interesting it doesn't get annoying after a while and I can still really enjoy it after all the times I've heard the CD. It's perfect for the first real song of the CD because it has it's own way of getting you interested. The lyrics are pretty good, too. This is one of the best to dance to.  <br /> <br />3. London Beckoned Songs About Money- 7/10 <br />I don't really like this song as much as some of the others. For one thing, it gets a little annoying after a while. Plus, this one isn't very original. The lyrics are also not the best and over it all it isn't a great song, but it's not bad either. <br /> <br />4. Nails for Breakfast- 8/10 <br />At first I didn't really like thisone but after a while it really started to get my interest. This one is pretty different sounding, and I love how it isn't really fast or loud feeling but it still is very strong. The lyrics are really good in this song, which is probably what got my interest. This one seems a lot less rock and more pop, however, and some people don't like that. <br /> <br />5. Camisado- 6/10 <br />I think this is my least favorite song on the CD. The sound isn't very interesting, it's not much different that a lot of other bands and the lyrics aren't that good.  <br /> <br />6. Time to Dance- 9/10 <br />I like this song a lot. It's a great beat and sounds so cool. The lyrics are awesome and the singer makes them sound so perfect with the song.  <br /> <br />7. Lying is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have- 10/10 <br />This is one of my very favorite songs on this CD. The lyrics are incredible and the vocals bring them out so well. The music goes so well with it, it's perfectly designed and it makes me just almost have to sing along.  <br /> <br />8. Intermission- 7/10 <br />I like this quite a bit. I love the piano playing, it's really perfect for an intermission. It's a cute little thing that just kind of sets up a little break for you if you are out of breath from singing. <br /> <br />9. But It's Better If You Do- 8/10 <br />This one is very catchy and the lyrics are nice. Not one of my ultimate favorites, but I do like it. It's a pretty good one to dance to. The lyrics are the kind that you can't help but sing along to. I love how the end goes right along into the beginning of the next song. <br /> <br />10. I Write Sins Not Tragedies- 10/10 <br />This is the song that got me into this band and I actually like it enough to buy the CD just based off of it, but I can even say that while I love this song to peices, some of the other ones by P!ATD are even better. The lyrics are awesome, I can't get them out of my head, and the song it's self is such a catchy one, a great beat. I love howit never stops being all action. It's also neat that while there really aren't that many words in the song it can go on and not sound boring.  <br /> <br />11. I Constantly Thank God for Esteban- 9/10 <br />The song is pretty unique sounding and I do like the lyrics quite a bit. It's not as fast and catching as some of the other songs and I think maybe it would be good if it was. I love the chorus and at some points the vocals are just magic. As great as these lyrics are, I don't think they'd be as good without such a talented singer. <br /> <br />12. There's a Good Reason These Tables Are Numbered- 10/10 <br />I love this song. It's so fast right from the beginning, not giving you a second to catch your breath. The lyrics are awesome and I love the chorus so much, it sound so incredible. Also, the second verse just begs you to sing along. The singer makes it all so great and this song is catchy. The fast beat goes so well with the way the song is and everything works together to make it so great. I love the ending, it slows down so much and then it ends with a bang. <br /> <br />13. Build God, Then We'll Talk- 10/10 <br />This is probably my favorite song, except maybe number 7. The lyrics are great and it's sung so well, he actually manages to change the meaning of words just by the way he sings them. The song tells a brilliant story with awesome music. I can't help but sing along every time I hear it and just want to dance. I love how lyrics from the Sound of Music are changed, it's so cute. This is definitley an awesome song.  <br /> <br />One more thing: labels really suck. I like music and I like a lot of different kinds and it's stupid to label songs because nearly every band is it's own type of music. Oh, and there are some bad words for any parents out there who are wondering, but it's not that bad. <br /> <br />Overall, it's a very catchy CD that I think is very original and it has some awesome lyrics. And no, it's not punk. But what does that matter?
076790592X|5.0|I read \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" before I started reading \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\". I found the previous one more interesting.  <br /> <br />
B00003CX8V|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, It may seem old fashion, it is in black and white but I have watched it many times and it is great for a rainy day.
B000002NHN|5.0|When you talk about music that conjures up exotic images of ancient cultures steeped in tradition, superstition and mystical beliefs, yet possessing a vast understanding of \\"the true nature of things\\" you are talking about the music of Loreena McKennitt.<br /><br />Possessing one of the most bewitching voices you'll ever hear singing lyrics pregnant with meaning and mystery, you will be transfixed by the depth, content and the multi-layered nature of the compositions contained on this -8 track- CD. Listen as the music and vocals weave a magical spell, creating and dispelling the shadows of medieval ghostly images as they dance in unison to 'The Mummers' Dance', 'La Serenissima' and 'Night Ride Across the Caucasus' or stand in solemn silence to the bittersweet incantation of 'Dante's Prayer.' This is truly timeless music that touches the soul.<br /><br />My Highest Recommendation!!
B000BYA5GO|1.0|After looking at a couple reviews for this, I thought I had found a good movie. It's mildly \\"OK\\" at best. I wish Hollywood would stick to movies and leave politics alone!
B000002UAO|5.0|I'm pretty sure Capitol records will release that inferior U.S. version on CD sometime in 2006 or 2007.After listening to them both,I'm glad the U.K. version was the first one issued on compact disc.Contrary to popular belief,the U.S. version does NOT work as a whole as good as the U.K. version.<br /><br />\\"Yesterday & Today\\"? Are you kidding me? That album's made up of \\"Rubber Soul\\",\\"Revolver\\" and \\"Help\\" piecework.Why not get the music the way it was originally sequenced?<br />  I know that I am angering quite a few people but everyone should be entitled to his or her opinion and this is mine.<br /><br />BUFFY'S TAKE (On a Scale Of 1 to 10)<br /><br />DRIVE MY CAR: 9.5<br />NORWEGIAN WOOD: 8.75<br />YOU WON'T SEE ME: 9.75<br />NOWHERE MAN: 9.70<br />THINK FOR YOURSELF: 9.70<br />THE WORD: 9.9<br />MICHELLE: 9.5<br />WHAT GOES ON: 8.0<br />GIRL: 8<br />I'M LOOKING THROUGH YOU: 9.75<br />IN MY LIFE: 10<br />WAIT: 9.25<br />IF I NEEDED SOMEONE: 9<br />RUN FOR YOUR LIFE: 9.4<br /><br />Recommendation?: Oh Yeah!

B0007GAERG|4.0|This is a very nice Mariah Carey album- it contains some very great ballads. although this album is not that Compelling. its still very nice to listen too(although this is an album to listen to in some type of occasions, not just whenever) . some of these songs sound as if 10 year old Micheal Jackson was singing them- as in the tunes of the Vocals.  <br /> <br />1.It's Like That- a really good song that has this really great beat and Infectious lyrics. 9/10  <br /> <br />2.We Belong Together- Amazing Lyrics and Beat- although some people might've thought that Mariah can sing cuz of this song(it's not true) she sang from her throat not her diaphram- along with most of the songs on this album. other than that The Best song on this Album 10/10  <br /> <br />3.Shake it Off- A Nice Upbeat tune that you will find yourself singing it all day- althougha Great song- its one of those that you get tiered of in a month or 2 9/10  <br /> <br />4.Mine Again- GREAT VOCALS, Amazing song- this is possibly my 2nd favorite song on the album- i hate the first 15 sec. but the rest of this song is WOW 9/10  <br /> <br />5.Say Somethin'-Lame As$ song with lame AS$ lyrics that shouldnt have even made it to earth, Scobby Doo or whatever his name is cant rap and he just made me hate the song even More. 0/10  <br /> <br />6.Stay the Night- A great Ballad to relax on- Great beat and very Decent Lyrics 7/10  <br /> <br />7.Get your Number- This song has some really good lyrics and a really good beat to it Jermaine Dupri did a great job- i really like his Voice. i like the line that says \\" i got a house in Capri and my own G4 and a Benz with the doors that lift off from the floor) I Love that line. 8/10  <br /> <br />8.One and Only- One of my favorite songs in this album Mariah and Twista both did very well together, and the song has a great beat AWESOME lyrics, one of the Best on this album 10/10  <br /> <br />9.Circles- Great lyrics- COOL beat, I Love to listen to this Song. I LOVE the line that says \\"as the tears rolled down my eyes\\" ONE of the Best on this album 10/10  <br /> <br />10.Your Girl- Another One of my favorites- great Lyrics and beat- although very short in the lyrics they are still quite nice. and the Beat of the song DEFINATLY makes up up for that. 8/10  <br /> <br />11.I Wish you Knew- Not a very good song- i just skip it when it comes up- its too slow and the lyrics are just lame. and the fake audiance in the background is so Fake and Stupid. 2/10  <br /> <br />12.To the Floor-An ok beat and alright lyrics that dont really captivate me. some of the vocals sound like Shake it off. 2/10  <br /> <br />13.A nice slow ballad that i wish i listend 2 more often. Ok Lyrics but a really nice slow Tempo  <br /> <br />14.Fly like a Bird- A good song that has good lyrics and nice a nice choir- although Mariah only sings half of the song and leaves the rest to her choir. its still good. 8/10 <br /> <br />My favroite songs are <br />we belong together <br />its like that <br />one and only <br />mine again  <br />circles <br /> <br />Its a good album- but she shouldnt have won a grammy for it- i understand winning a grammy for \\"we belong together\\" but this album shouldnt even have gotten nominated. what gets on my nerves about Mariah is that she and the public think that just because she can hit some Calassal note and that she's the greatest singer of all time!! NOT TRUE!! what makes a great singer of all time is not the range of their voice, but how they perform- move with the music and how they're able to bring people from diffrent types of cultures and races together just to liste to that performer like Micheal Jackson <br /> <br />Overall Grade: 7/10 <br />
B000002UB6|5.0|Aside from the fact people have labelled this album \\"The House That Phil Spector Built\\",aside from the fact that his people ruined \\"The Long & Winding Road\\" and \\"Across The Universe\\",his only triumph was his handling of \\"I Me Mine\\".For some reason he used an alternate take of \\"Get Back\\" and added a new guitar solo to the title song.When he left the Beatles alone,the results were better:\\"Two Of Us\\",\\"Dig A Pony\\" and \\"I've Got A Feeling\\" didn't suffer like \\"TLAWR\\" and \\"ATU\\" did.<br /><br />It's not as bad as some people make it out to be.It's just not one of their best.<br /><br />BUFFY\\"S TAKE: Not \\"Revolver\\" (a great album!) but not \\"Yellow Submarine\\" either (a not so great album!).<br />Anyway,on a scale from 1 to 10:<br /><br />TWO OF US: 8<br />DIG A PONY: 8<br />ACROSS THE UNIVERSE: 1 (Check Out The One on Anthology 2!: 11)<br />I ME MINE: 10<br />LET IT BE: 10<br />I'VE GOT A FEELING: 8<br />ONE AFTER 909: 3<br />THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD: 4 (The Original Version on \\"Anthology 3 is spectacular!: 11)<br />FOR YOU BLUE: 5<br />GET BACK: 5 (The single version sounds better:10)<br /><br />I'd recommend it,<br />it's O.K.
B00005R62K|5.0|To me ; \\"Stained Class\\" and \\"British Steel\\" are the best from Judas Priest. Period!.
6305907145|5.0|I loved the movie; I loved the book in its pure form.  It's important to keep in mind that this is an adaptation, like \\"Clueless\\" is an adaption of *Emma* or *Bridget Jones Diary* is an adaptation of *Pride and Prejudice*.  One of the great things about Austen is that, like Shakespeare, her work is still relevant, and lends itself well to adaptation, to re-interpretation, to further exploration, whatever the decade. And Frances O'Connor is wonderful. Actually, I thought the entire cast was wonderful.   <br /> <br />Probably the best thing about Austen?  Her enduring popularity probably means that if you don't like this movie, and didn't like the purer BBC version, chances are that 10 years from now another version will be made and you can see if that one works best for you . . . . or learn to savor the versions for their differences, like different vintages of good wine. <br /> <br />If you like privity and purity between book and script, watch something else.  If you like invention and artistic risk, give this version a chance. <br />
B000CDINOK|4.0|I would rate this dvd 5 stars if it wasent for the shoody camera work that looks like it was filmed by an hyperactive child suffering ADD, & a lack of 5.1, also brings down the score. Apart from these setbacks i highly recommened it just to hear the crowd singing along to your favourite tunes...
0446677450|1.0|The basic gyst of this book is \\"find a way to get money to work for you,\\" i.e. invest it in something. The author is so self righteous and equates being rich with being and doing what's right.  <br />He gives a very weak defense about screwing other people to get there. Sure, there are lots of ways to get rich, but none of the ones he has listed will actually do anything good for society- his fortune was made almost completely off jacking up the price of real estate...not exactly something that I'd be proud of telling my kids about.

1563523302|5.0|The Millionaire Next Door is a book that talks about the wealthy and the characteristics they share.  The authors provide statistical information that they gather from their research to prove that obtaining a modest amount of wealth is not that far fetch.   <br />Some of the key topics are 1) being frugal 2) being smart with the resources we have (time, energy, and money) 3) discipline (financial defense). <br />In my opinion this book is a must read for those who are young and inexperience (college students or recent grads). People who have children should also read this book because it has good advice in regards to parenting. I was able to obtain this book from my library and I don't think it's necessary to own a copy of the title but it could be a great gift to a love one (a son/daughter or grandchild in college).
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|Another piece of colorful Disney Magic worth having.  The cast of interesting characters includes: Chicken Little, Ugly Ducking, Fish Out Of Water, Buck Cluck, Foxy Loxy, and many others.  The full color graphics are great and the story line held our family's interest until the end. Numerous extras are included, such as 3 different openings, making of the DVD, Trivia Game, Karaoke Sing Along, Cheetah Girls Music Video, Barenaked Ladies Music Video. Our family enjoyed it, in-fact it has been viewed several times since we got it. The technology available today is unbelievable !!

B00003CX5P|4.0|The whole family really enjoyed this special effects thriller!  Although we have the whole series now, this film could stand alone and be very enjoyable because they fill you in on any detail you may have missed from the other films, without seeming out of place, and they don't even have to do that very often.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Even better than the novel on which it is based, this rousing period adventure traces the nautical adventures of Lucky Captain Jack Aubrey and his crew.  Near flawless special effects combine with a solid story, cinematography, soundtrack and performances...most efficiently led by the great Russell Crowe.  The supporting performances and production design are also beyond reproach, especially an Oscar-worthy turn by Paul Bettany as the ship's doctor.<br /><br />A wonderful movie to enjoy.  Too bad there are no special bonus features to compliment the great movie.  Available for a low price, so who's to complain!?
B000E8QVWY|4.0|<br />WALK THE LINE, the Johnny Cash-June Carter story, is an exhilarating musical biography.  It starts in 1968 inside Folsom Prison, flashes back to Cash's childhood in the Deep South of the early 1950's, then works its way back up to 1968 and beyond.  With brilliant performances by Joaquin Phoenix (Oscar nominee) and Reese Witherspoon (Oscar winner), Cash's life and music career come alive.  Both actors spent months learning how to do their own singing and guitar playing live before an audience, and it shows in the electrifying musical numbers. <br /> <br />Director/co-writer James Mangold filmed the movie on location in Memphis, Nashville, and Arkansas along (I think) the Mississippi River.  The 1950's and 1960's sets and costumes, from my own childhood era, are perfection and should have been Oscar-nominated if they weren't.  The film runs 135 minutes, but between the concert scenes and period re-creation, I never wanted it to end.  If WALK THE LINE has any flaw, in fact, it is that it could have lasted longer for me and didn't just put three more decades of narrative crawls against a black finale background.  I wanted more music and more of the perfect Phoenix and Witherspoon performances. <br /> <br />This may be one of the finest musical biographies I have ever seen.  The DVD includes a directors' commentary and 10 deleted scenes that help clarify scene and character. WALK THE LINE is a beautifully crafted labor of love movie gem.  It particularly deserved the Sound Mixing Oscar nomination for spectacular concert scenes.  The movie plays and sounds, inexplicably, way better on DVD than in a theater. It is an absolute must-see. NOTE: Made in Panavision; buy or rrent the widescreen version.  Amazon.com is selling it at half-price. <br /> <br />
1419359827|5.0|Great read, or listen, as the case may be! I didn't come away from this book with any one or two nuggets of gold. In fact, I had already read some of the stories in some of Malcolm Gladwell's articles and books. I had even taken a course called Social Network Analysis in the University of Cincinnati's MBA program. Still, Ferrazzi's book is a great read for those well connected or those looking to become better connected. By the way, I ripped the tracks to MP3, put them on my iPod, and listened to them in the car (via FM adapter) on my way to/from work, which is only a 15 minute drive one way. I often found myself sitting in the car a bit longer at the end of the trip so I could finish out a chapter. The Connector's Hall of Fame Profiles were by far my favorite aspect of the book. They were refreshinig, educational, and helped you to visualize the message that Ferrazzi seemed to be trying to communicate.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Howard Shore's brilliance shines like the Evenstar in the last of his soundtracks. With emotion going high as Peter Jackson wraps up his motion picture trilogy, Shore's music matches the emotion levels. <br /> <br />Strains of the theme song run constantly through. The theme song for the Rohirrim goes sweetly through, especially in the Ride of the Rohirrim. Minas Tirith also gets its fair due as Howard Shore weaves the constant themes together. Into the West sung by Annie Lennox completes the soundtrack, describing the Undying Lands with sadness and at the same time, joy, ending the movies and music. Eventually, you are left with a lingering joy.
B00005NRNB|3.0|I'm not going to write a review for the movie itself, just the Superbit DVD vs. the original one. With the Superbit DVD you get a slightly better picture image but not anything drastic, at least not that I noticed. It also produces very clear sound, but again, hardly more noticeable than a standard DVD. The downside to this was that the special features were taken off which dissapointed me greatly since I am a fan of commentaries. With the two different DVD's out now you have a choice between special features and better quality so when making your purchase just be aware of the differences.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I have never written a movie review, but then, I have never seen a movie like Brokeback Mountain.  It was after the Oscars that I went.  I asked my husband if he wanted to see it, and understood when he said, \\"Maybe in the privacy of our own living room.\\"  I went to a matinee in our small town, and was the only person in the room--it was divine. From the first close-up I was entranced--Ang Lee promising me that I would really get to know these characters.  He kept his promise.  <br /> <br />You know the story; I'm not here to re-tell it.  What I would like (need, actually) is to relate is how it affected me:   <br /> <br />For days afterward, Ennis would whisper new insights to me: \\"Did you get that when she asked to move to town, she was asking me to give up ranch life, which was all that I had?\\"  No, Ennis.  I missed that.  Thank you.  <br /> <br />And then, \\"Wasn't it considerate of Jack not to tell me that the Brokeback boss had seen us [intimately] together?\\"  Oh, yes, Ennis.  It was.  He loved you that much.  <br /> <br />I talked about the movie a lot with my husband, and he listened.  I assured him that if he decided to see the film that it must be on the big screen.  Some things are just too good--too big--to be first-viewed on DVD.   <br /> <br />Together, we went to Sunday's matinee.  My partner of nearly 40 years was moved more than either of us would have imagined.  In his own sweet way, he had been waiting for me to test the waters, then allowed me to lead him in.  I am thrilled that we were able to share the experience, and it continues to spur much, soulful conversation between us. <br /> <br />I didn't cry the first time I saw Brokeback, but Sunday, after Ennis's final line, and all through the credits, tears came in a way I have never experienced--a tear at a time, alternating eyes.  I swear, I would lightly dab the corner of one eye, then the other, and so on, feeling like I could have done it for hours.   <br /> <br />This film not only made me proud to be a writer and gave me a deeper understanding of my beloved gay friends from my theatre days, but has restored my faith in humanity.  It is a visual masterpiece.  Pure, cinematic genius.  A hauntingly beautiful love story that expands and enlivens the heart.  These dear, dear characters will walk beside me for a long, long time. <br /> <br />My deepest gratitude to all involved for getting this love story told.  <br />
B000BEZQ18|5.0|This is easily one of the best soundtrack CD's I've ever listened to.  It brings back all the pain & pleasure of the movie itself.  Easy to see why Gustavo Santaolalla won the Oscar, it was richly deserved.  Hard to see why the movie didn't win Best Film, or why Emmylou Harris & \\"A Love That Will Never Grow Old\\" weren't nominated.

B00005JLEX|1.0|The show is not funny. There are too many reasons I could list here to explain, but I don't have 5 or 6 hours to list them all here.<br /><br />The number one reason for me, though, is that even though it carries itself off as a comedy, all it has EVER been was a bunch of people smashed up through odd circumstances, arriving at impossibly unusual, uncomfortable endings which we are expected to \\"laugh\\" while squirming, all set up by the sheer ugliness and meanspiritedness of the writers' intent. They succeed in making you feel bad, then make you feel smug - why? - because it's not happening to you.<br /><br />I expected better from them, and received NOTHING in return for it.<br /><br />Now I know why everyone says \\"it's a show about nothing.\\"<br /><br />It truly is nothing.<br /><br />Buy yourself a copy of any of the seasons of \\"The West Wing\\" or even \\"E.R.\\" if you had to, but please - don't waste your time here.<br /><br />AND put another shiny coin into Jerry's already well-documented and well-bloated pockets.<br /><br />Oy!
0553801503|2.0|Like everyone else here, I also loved the first 3 installments. Best fantasy books I have ever read in my life. <br /> <br />But I have to agree with most of the negative reviews. The book is much too long, too many unnecessary details, too much repeats, focus on characters who are boring, and just basically boring to read. <br /> <br />I was so excited to see the book at a local bookstore in SF and immediately sat down to read it before buying it. After staying there and reading for about 3 hours, I just gave up and left the store without the book. <br /> <br />It was a CHORE to read the book because it was so boring. I had to constantly skim to look for interesting tidbits. <br /> <br />I hope George R Martin doesnt fall into the trap of trying to extend this series just to make book sales. I am definitely not going to pre-order the next book until I read it at the bookstore first. Because if this is an indication of where he is taking things, I am going to stay happy with the first few books and not spend money to support such mediocre work.
B000002GJH|5.0|Grunge purists aside, guys, this album is definitely a MUST for rock fans, whatever their style is. Music and lyrics from the heart, life as it is, no teenage wasteland topics. Inspiring songs, even though some of them were sadly \\"in loving memory of\\". Take as an example \\"Call Me A Dog\\", an anthem to all those taken-for-granted, cheated, mistreated great fellows around us. This song is everything everybody wants to say when others point their finger at you for free. Musically-wise, head-blowing bluesy guitar solos from \\"Say Hello To Heaven\\" and \\"Call Me A Dog\\", plus hammering piano chords in \\"Times Of Trouble\\" choruses, leave no doubt rock can be mellow and strong without losing a bit of authenticity. If you're an open-minded rock musician who loves good lyrics, this is your album. Forget about labels and styles and enjoy MUSIC in capitals.

1932907009|5.0|I've read numerous books on screenwriting, and while many are helpful, few are as approachable as \\"Save The Cat: The last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need\\". Blake Snyder's style is casual and to the point. The book is filled with incredibly useful chapters thankfully devoid of fluff or or excessive wordiness. <br /> <br />One thing to study is the \\"Blake Snyder Beat Sheet\\". It takes all the basics of structure and gives you a solid framework to start with, while at the same time being intuitive. Apply it to the next movie you watch and it'll make perfect sense. <br /> <br />I recently earned a certificate in screenwriting from UCLA, and I recommend this book for writers of all experience levels, either as a refresher, crash course, or or supplement to what you already know. <br /> <br />Mike Hultquist.

B000001F9E|5.0|\\"Oh, poor Romeo,  <br />sitting all on his own-ee-oh\\" <br />I don't know how Phil Lynnot can make this fake rhyme sound so good. But he does. And I don't understand how this album could ever pass as hard rock music. Because a lot of the songs are soft pop songs. But I guess Thin Lizzy can do as they please. They rock. Even when, on the surface, they don't.
B000E8N690|3.0|The first thing that sticks out to me about this film is the audio. It's sharp, clear, excellent. If your not watching this on a decent home theatre system you are missing a whole lot.Viewing this I kept waiting for particuler events to happen that never played out. Ring of Fire was not presented as a true focalpoint of Johnny and June's relationship, just bits and pieces of another song being written. It wasn't even discussed between them in the film. Strange. Then they played it uneventfully. Mr. Phoenix had Cash's movements down well but I kept being distracted by predictability. The film is entertaining though and I learned a little more about times and places. Reese Witherspoon is finally playing a role made for her instead of those cheesy supposed comedy \\"films\\". Her acting had real believability and she was properly awarded. A Boy Named Sue was not used for the prison singing scenes and I'm not sure why. It was done there, has wide appeal, would capture a new audience and is just a wild song to have witnessed prisoner reaction to. <br />                 I wanted to see Johnny Cashes spiritual road expounded upon more but the film ended rather abruptly. The Elvis scenes seemed very forgetable and cheapish. I like Johnny Cash and their was a great deal to the man, but the movie came up missing that critical essence of a very changed deeper person. A trying effort by all though.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I watched Firefly when it was on TV and own the DVD set so I was excited about the movie and had high expectations. Those expectations were met, even if they werent exceeded. I want to make this review for people who are not familiar with the show. It helps if you're a science fiction fan, but it's not required. Essentially Serenity is a space opera that blends the setting of the old west with the far future. Sounds like a gimmick? Well it isn't. Why isn't it? Because it's done right.     The way the story blends the various elements make it believable that there are some well established planets that are futuristic are \\"Star Trek\\"-like and there are other planets that have hardly been colonized, thus more like frontier land. This is where our heroes come from. It's easier to understand and get that feel if you have seen the TV series, but you get enough exposition to keep the new viewers from looking at the movie cross-eyed.     The script is, of course, solid. Joss Whedon is known throughout the entertainment industry as being a very good writer. He alone turned a silly B-movie (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) into one of the best-written series on television. Joss' script for Serenity is no exception. You get a good mix of plot twists, comical moments, and drama peppered throughout a story that starts off simple then opens up pretty big. The only negative I will give on the writing is the movie has the pacing and feel of a television show. It reminds me of the same feel I got from Star Trek: Insurrection. It's not necessarily a bad thing. It's just an approach to the movie that's different than what I'm used to from a feature film. Don't let that keep you from seeing Serenity. If it's like a TV show, it's like the best TV show you will ever see on the big screen.     While this movie only had a budget about $40 million you wouldn't know by looking at it. They put that money on some fantastic special effects. The scenes in space are beautiful to behold, both the calm ones and the massively large ship battles. By the way I think Serenity does a better job with the big space battle than Star Wars Ep3 (same crazy action, but nowhere near as distracting). I think what helped on the budget was many of the sets were already built from the television show. Still the audio and added effects do stand out in a very good way. The acting is so solid you will find yourself liking more than one character in the movie. The music is a nice blend of that space opera soundtrack and old west.     This DVD includes extras like deleted scenes, outtakes, and some documentaries. The deleted scenes are nice. Some of them are so good I really hope Joss decides to do a director's cut DVD and put some of those scenes back in. The bloopers/outtakes are so-so. It has some funny off-the-cuff kind of stuff, but mostly it's the actors forgetting lines and cursing about it (it's worth noting the outtakes should be considered at the VERY least PG-13, if not R, when watching with the kids due to language). The documentaries are a mixed bag for me. Having seen the documentaries in the Firefly DVD I can tell these are lacking somewhat. They are still good documentaries. Just not as good as on the TV DVD set.     The introduction by Joss Whedon is the one they played at the pre-screenings so it won't really hit home to the new viewer as it does the fan. Personally I can do without it. Too evangelitical. There is a commentary track by Joss also, which is much better than the introduction. He gives a lot of director-type information like lighting and what camera lenses they used, but mentions nothing in lines of background info on the story. Joss also self-depreciates himself a lot on the commentary. First its entertaining that he can crack wise on himself, but it eventually gets old.     This is a great DVD for any science-fiction fan. You get a good story, great action, sweet special effects, and some nice extra material to boot. If you got caught in the middle of the whole Brownshirt fiasco and ended up resenting ever watching this film youre doing yourself a disservice. Forget the fanboys and take the movie for what it is a good sci-fi adventure.     HD-DVD Version    You get the same cool movie with a heck of a higher resolution. The down side is it looks like you lose some of the bonus features. The documentaries are still there, but it seems like maybe the outtakes and deleted scenes aren't. Don't ask me why they wouldn't just put it in. There should be plenty of room on the new technology. If they do indeed have all of the special features found in the original DVD on this HD-DVD version than by all means go for the higher resolution (if you have a HD-DVD player). Otherwise wait until a better version comes along.
B000DWMYQ8|2.0|Chicken Little, voiced by Zach Braff (Tv's Scrubs, Garden State), rings the bell yelling \\"The Sky is Falling\\" but it isnt true, so this upsets the towns folk and makes everyone in town made and his Dad, voiced by Garry Marshall is too. He then tries to impress his Dad by going on the baseball team, in which he wins the game for the team and this makes his Dad proud of him. Then, a piece of the sky does fall into Chicken Little's room and he brings his friends there so they can see as well. Then, they find the mother load....a big spaceship which was hidden like the sky. Soon, Chicken Little screams again that there is \\"an alien spaceship\\" and it vanished which enrages the townsfolk more. Then the aliens attack because their son (Kirby) is missing. So Chicken Little and his gang try to flee the on coming alien onslaught in order to bring back the little furry kid. Funny in small does, pointless in some and it's really just for kids...that's if some kids like it. The Porkcupine was cool, he delivered three lines \\"Yo, No and Whoa!\\" Also starring the voices of Steve Zahn (Suburbia, Sahara), Joan Cusack (High Fidelity, Grosse Pointe Blank), Fred Willard (A Mighty Wind, Best in Show), Cathrine O'Hara (Home Alone 1&2), Amy Sedaris (Stay, Bewitched), Patrick Warburton (Kronks New Groove, The Venture Bros.), Patrick Stewart (Star Trek: First Contact, MasterMinds), Adam West (Family Guy, Batman), Wallace Shawn (Princess Bride, Melinda and Melinda), Harry Shearer (This Is Spinal Tap, A Mighty Wind) and Don Knotts (Pleasantville, Andy Griffith) as Mayor Turkey Lurkey.

B00005JOHI|2.0|I too was very excited to hear of a new version of this movie...I am an avid fan of the book and the 1995 A&E adaption. I could write for days, but to sum up my feelings: I didn't feel Knightley portrayed Elizabeth as she should be...Knightley's version was more pouty, angry, miffed all the time, rather than playful and teasing as she should be. I didn't feel any chemistry between Elizabeth and Darcy. Wickham was almost nonexistant, which is a major problem, since we really need to understand how awful he is to understand the storyline! I understand that in a feature length adaption, some details had to be sacrificed, but I feel that anyone who isn't familiar with the material will be lost, or at least won't appreciate all that is happening properly. That said, it had some parts that were well done, the scenery was lovely...but the end, with all the Mrs. Darcy's...ugh! I love a good romance, but that almost make me ill! CHEEESY!
B0000C7PRY|5.0|The last person's review was uncalled for. Therefore now is the time for my review! Testimony is the result of a mastermind musician looking back on how God was slowly but clearly revealed to him throughout his life. Right from the first song the listener senses a longing for the everlasting, a second chance to go back to being fresh and new, a clear slate to begin again. That longing indicates that somethng is missing. The listener journeys with Neal through his past up until his conversion to Christianity. Many of these songs are complex enough that it takes multiple listens just to appreciate the virtuosity AND melodies. This is a five star release for sure. Pick this one up and then check out his newest release titled(?). Or vice-versa! <br />

B00001OH1S|1.0|I had a horrible experience with this purchase, when I received the CD, the jewel case, as well as the CD were broken, I tried calling 800, etc but got nowhere. I suspect UPS broke it, and called their claims Dept, they said they'd call me and possibly pick up the CD to inspect it, needless to say they never did, and I've been getting the runaround from UPS since. I already purchased the CD from my local Amoeba Records store. If at all possible can I get a store credit to buy something else. Thank you. <br />And if I may suggest don't use UPS to ship stuff.
B00004XONN|5.0|I'll admit it, I just didn't get this album at first. I was first introduced to radiohead by OK Computer back in 2004 and I was simply amazed. I quickly went out and bought \\"The Bends\\" and \\"Pablo Honey\\". It took some time for me to actually go out and buy \\"Kid A\\", but when I did, I was dumbfounded. I labled this, as well as \\"amnesiac\\" and \\"hail to the thief\\", as OKAY. But this CD has finally grown on me. Simply put, this is THE greatest radiohead album to date. The lyrics, the roaring soundscapes, and of course thom yorke's amazing voice bring this album together. Everything seems so perfect, from the eccentric bass line of \\"The National Anthem\\", the beutiful guitar work of \\"optimistic\\", to the heart-pounding techno jam \\"idioteque\\". Amazing, highy recommended for fans of quality music.
B0006GAXAA|5.0|Below you will find a lengthy analysis of one song on this record \\"I want you back.\\" If a single song can generate this kind of response, imagine the musical content of the entire 21 song record. <br /> <br />This song obliterates me. All the performances are incredible, including, to quote a friend, Michael's astounding, dumbfounding lead vocal. <br /> <br />The bass part sounds to me as if it came straight from the composer and arranger, but in any matter it's stuffed full with inventive ideas and super fonky! Given the calculated nature of this recording I would expect the arranger to have worked out the bass part note for note. The recording is a careful tapestry of many sounds that blend together to give the overall effect. The intro is a good example. The melody played by the bass is wonderful, but that melody is doubled by other instruments plus other things are woven around that melody, all indicating that the arranger wrote it all out note for note, the bass player serving to faithfully play the arrangement. <br /> <br />(Un)fortunately, any excellence in other portions of this song is obscured by Michael's unbelievable vocal. So much stuff, so much soul, so much range and flexibility. This vocal is way in the unbelievable range for any artist. But to come from a brand new 11 year old is, as my friend put it so well, \\"dumbfounding.\\" (If this selection does not feature sound clips, look at other Jackson 5 records here on Amazon to hear the mentioned snippets.) <br />*He sounds a little hoarse and that increases the authority.  <br />*The way he uses subtle, rhythmic vibrato on the word \\"me\\" in the phrase \\"won't you please let me back in your heart.\\" (Hear this on the Amazon snippet.) <br />*The pause and surprise attack on the word \\"back\\" in the same phrase. (Hear this on the Amazon snippet.) <br />*The screaming with 100% authority.  <br />*The drifting out of tune on the words \\"now, baby, yeah\\" in the phrase \\"Yes I do now, Oh oh baby, yeah yeah yeah yeah,Nah Nah no no.\\" (Is there a technical term for this \\"drifting out of tune\\" vocal technique?) (Hear this on the Amazon snippet.) <br />*The authority and inventiveness and soul of the scatting on that same phrase and other scats in the song, including the various fun \\"Huh\\"s. <br />*The natural way he does the call and response sections with his brothers. <br />*The perfect timing all over the place, including jumping on some of the responses a little early. <br />*The exciting vocal build on the phrase \\"All I want, all I need, all I want, all I need!\\" with the fantastic atonal exclamation on the second \\"all I want.\\" <br />And on and on. You could almost analyze every single note the guy sings. The fact that this guy could do this at 11 years old shows beyond any question that singing at this level requires talent given to you directly by God. You can't get it and you can't learn it. God either gave it to you or He didn't. My guess is that some genius worked out most of this stuff and recorded a track for Michael to sing along with during the session. I mean God given talent or not, Michael could not have come up with that stuff on his own, atonal, drifting out of tune, etc. But to even sing along and get these results....incredible. Plus, who was that singing genius that came up with all that stuff? <br /> <br />Other great parts of the song are the pervasive background vocals, the excellent call and response, the subtle, almost inaudible use of strings and background vocalizing, and the various guitar parts that weave an interesting tapestry. <br /> <br />One thing that I think is ground breaking but at the same time takes away from this arrangement is the calculated, restrained drum part. The drum part sounds completely canned, written out and played note for note. It's not exuberant; instead it's carefully restrained. To my ears it sounds too mellow for this joyous, raucous romp. But it's groundbreaking because this style of drumming became prevalent later and today in the 2000s you rarely hear any drum pyrotechnics in favor of a steady drum beat that does not break the flow of the song. <br /> <br />I wonder if all the vocals on this recording are Jacksons? I assume they are and that shows the talent of this family and the quality of this product. <br /> <br />Excellence and analysis of each individual part aside, the real value of this song, besides Michael's vocal which you simply can not retire to the background, is the overall sound. Each part is carefully calculated and blended to create a unique, exuberant, joyful, new, and instantly recognizable sound that's unlike anything that had been heard before. Though each part is worthy of study, perhaps the best way to listen to this song is with a 6 inch speaker through an AM radio in your car. And isn't that the way it was meant to be? <br /> <br />Larry Brown <br /> <br />

B000ASDFJU|2.0|Many people out there look at this series as a mature, adult show about women and their real problems.  This show is neither mature nor adult.  This show is really just a glorified sitcom, with dirty talk and some very short (and not erotic) sex scenes.  The 4 women are very superficial, and are not very realistic.  Constantly eating out at posh restaurants in Manhattan (there are other burroughs in NYC, such as Queens and Brooklyn, where it is much cheaper to eat) every day, sleeping with a different man each week, buying as many things as they can, partying all hours of the night, and they still find time to work their professional jobs.  These women are supposed to be \\"professionals\\", but if that were the case, they would never be able to keep up their lifestyles (even with doing Red Bulls and coke all day).  I feel that these women are very unhappy, and they look for fullfilment through a hedonistic lifestyle.  I hark back to the 1960's in the films L'avventura and La Dolce Vita, where this kind of lifestyle was depicted as cheap (spiritually speaking), hollow, shallow, and depressing (and it still is, regardless of what the media may tell you).  Most of their affairs are quite meaningless, it's mostly sex without emotion, and the conversations remind me more of locker room talk written by sitcom writers.  And the sex scenes (which many people told me they were so hot) are tepid at best.  I have seen films by European art filmmakers (Bertolucci and Breillat, to name a few) that are light years more honest and artistic than anything this show can put out.  Americans have very childish attitudes towards sex, almost childlike.  They giggle at dirty talk, and try to show off their \\"knowledge\\" of sex, like when a 6th grader discovers the sex ed book, and brags about the new dirty words he/she has discovered.  Overall, a very disappointing show.  Do not fool yourselves...

B00000IPAX|5.0|I am fully aware that this is NOT punk rock at all, but I feel it is pop punk at its best. It has punk elements and doesn't go overboard with the pop. These guys are one of my favourite bands ever and are truly great musicians, and every song on this CD is excellent. Here's a breakdown: <br /> <br />1.Dumpweed-One of the best intro songs to an album ever. Really fast paced and energetic with the memorable lyric \\"I need a girl that I can train\\". 9.5/10 <br />2.Don't Leave Me - A really solid song. Great vocals by Mark, cool lyrics. 8.5/10 <br />3.Aliens Exist - Just a really awesome song, about aliens. How could it not be good? 8.5/10 <br />4.Going Away To College - An AMAZING song. Very pop punkish, but if you buy this album you better like that genre. Really cool lyrics, a romantic feel to it. 10/10 <br />5.What's My Age Again - Another great song. Their first really huge hit. One of my faves because I can really relate to the whole immaturity thing. Really awesome guitar intro and HILARIOUS video. It really sums up what blink is all about. 9.5/10 <br />6.Dysentary Gary - Really cool, fast paced tune with a kick ass guitar riff at the beginning. Great vocal part by Mark in the middle of the song and the lyrics in the last verse are really rad. 9/10 <br />7.Adam's Song - Probably the most memorable song on the whole album. In my opinion, it is one of blink's greatest songs. A really sad song dealing with loneliness and depression with awesome vocals by Mark. The Best Song on the album (my opinion). 10/10 <br />8.All The Small Things - The poppiest song on the album, but I have to admit it is addicting. Very catchy, with one of the best music videos EVER. Even if you hate blink or don't know anything about blink, odds are you know this song. 9/10 <br />9.The Party Song - One of the best on the album with another great, memorable line \\"Some girls try to hard\\". 9.5/10 <br />10.Mutt - If you've seen American Pie, you know this song. Really kick ass song, with great lyrics. Alot more punkish then most of the songs, and the last song recorded with Scott Reynor, blink's last drummer before Travis. 9.5/10 <br />11.Wendy Clear - Another solid, pop punkish song. The vocals are really good with a catchy guitar riff. 9/10 <br />12.Anthem - A really solid close to the album. Fantastic drumming by Travis, and a song alot of teenagers can relate to. 9/10
B000E5N62U|2.0|I'm a big fan--have been since the 70's.  I'm also a trained musician who has taught in a conservatory and made a living doing film-scores.  I mention this because it partly explains my minority view, here.  I try to listen technically--and I don't mean listen to audio fidelity or the mix--which is, of course, impeccable.    This is a dull album.  It doesn't improve with repeated listenings.  It gets more painful.   Repeat:  This is dull.    main problem:  the grooves.  excepting Nightgown, there's very little lift or snap to the grooves.  the session players are competent pros, and they play like it--nothing more.   (Poor communication between player and composer?  who knows)    second problem:  slack-ish lyrics.  nothing in the same league with previous efforts.    third problem: plenty of chord-changes, but to little effect.  craft but no excitement.    fourth problem:  not funky, but also not rock-y.  solos merely careful and competent.  this isn't jazz, it's not funk, it's not rock, it's just...careful.    fifth problem: too much medium-tempo plodding, with little contrast in tempos.    sixth problem:  lack of hooks    seventh problem: lack of space, or use of silence--things are filled-in, but again, to little effect    Pagoda has a long line and interesting Lydian-ish chord changes, but a contrived long line is not the same thing as an inspired melody that soars because the composer felt it that way.      this is mastered loud, but 'loud' is not 'powerful'    this is dull, dull, dull.

B000BW7QWW|3.0|I enjoyed the TV series \\"Firefly\\" and I enjoy the movie, but one of the problems with movies is the noise from the other patrons.   I purchased Firefly & Serenity and watch them with the closed captioning turned on, there is so much missed dialogue.  If you do a Google search for \\"Chinese used in Firefly & Serenity\\" you can get translation for the Chinese used, some is quite rude but amusing.  Just showed this to my Grandchildren, thought it would be OK as it's PG13, then we saw the Bounus Features \\"Out Takes\\", use caution, the Out Takes are peppered with the \\"F\\" Word, there should be a warning that the language is Rated R.

My husband was impressed by the wonderful scenes and excellent graphics.  However, he's a realist and thought some of the scenes weren't credible.

B000E6UK5K|1.0|The album was extremely disappointing. The references to sounding Floyd like are well off base, the whole album sounds like it needs finishing. <br /> <br />I would strongly recommend that you listen to this before purchase I believe that most Floyd fans would give a positive review to an American Idol preliminary round failure if he was associated with the band. <br /> <br />This is an album thats trading purely on name recgonizition and the album was released so late in case it affected ticket sales for his current tour. <br /> <br />Alan

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Let me just start by saying, that I had never seen the 1995 BBC mini series with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, never read the book and had no real desire to see this movie.  Caught it on a plane ride home and I have to say that it took my breath away.  I loved Matthew and Keira together - there chemistry was unbelievable.  Since that plane ride home, I have bought the movie and watch it anytime I can.  I have read the book twice which gives a little more background and watched the 1995 mini series.  I have to say, and I know people are going to be quite angry, I did not feel any chemistry between Firth and Ehle.  I thought the new adaptation of Pride and Prejudice had more emotion and wish that THEY would do the 6 hour mini series because that I would definately buy.  I have told everyone I know about this movie and how fantastic Matthew played the part of Mr. Darcy.  By far my favorite movie ever and will continue to watch it faithfully any chance I get.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It is a shame the series was canceled; Firefly was a unique and very well crafted series, more than well worth having.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|This documentary blew my socks off... it is everything I'd hoped it would be and more.  I have been an avid Dylan fan for 40-some years. 'No Direction Home' is an insightful treasure.  I was thrilled with Dylan's own reflections, musings and memories throughout.  Equally endearing to me is his apparent self-consciousness and humility in his commentaries... his subtle sense of humor is delightful. I was quite impressed by his down to earth, genuine demeanor. Though larger than life, he is a very human man who differs from most of us largely in his courage and persistence in relentlessly pursuing an unknown \\"direction home\\"...      I truly enjoyed the stories of Liam Clancy, Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, and so many others who have known Dylan from the beginning of his career.  The plethora of rare old film footage was definitely a bonus.  The chronicle of his early Britain tour seemed to expose a vulnerability in the young Dylan that I had never seen before.  I found this to be quite poignant.    (This has no particular bearing on the film, but... I was taken aback at the end of the 2nd DVD, about half way through the credits, by Dylan's \\"Lay Down Your Weary Tune\\", sung from beginning to end. This song has been running through my head since Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast. The lyrics are especially powerful to me, and this ended my experience on a sweetly emotional note.)        I highly recommend this DVD set for everyone who is interested in the evolution of music and Bob Dylan's essential role in that evolution.  Kudos to Martin Scorsese for doing this powerful film... a true work of art.  It left me wanting more... I hope Mr. Scorsese will pick up where he left off in a future documentary... there are so many more years to cover.  Oh, and Mr. Dylan, I do hope you returned those Woodie Guthrie records you \\"borrowed\\"!
B000E97Y6K|2.0|I am a big fan of the original King Kong, and maybe that's the problem. The new version of King Kong follows the original very closely ( maybe too closely ). Other than the special effects, there was nothing really very original to be found in the remake. <br />I saw the remake in the theatre, and all I could think of by the time he climbed the empire state building was, can you hurry up and kill the ape so I can go home. Sorry, it was a real bore, and a big let down, not unlike the remake of the fog.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|Don't get me wrong... I have been a fan of  <br />A7X ever since their first EP, and have  <br />followed this band up until now. This CD is <br />complete garbage. The vocals are completly  <br />corny, and the way Shadows sings  sounds  <br />completly wrong. I will admit the guitars are <br />okay, but A7X is another one of those awesome <br />bands that just completly sells out. Honestly, <br />if you want to hear real A7X, get Sounding the  <br />Seventh Trumpet(they were not sellouts then). <br /> <br />This CD has turned my veiw of A7X perminatly. <br />Sevenfold has lost so many original fans because <br />of this retarded album. <br /> <br />Hey, At least they are making money. <br />(A7X is a discrace to Hardcore)  <br /> <br />
B000BW7QWW|3.0|I am a big fan of 'Firefly' and the excitement of seeing that universe come alive on the big screen was thrilling but 'Serenity' delivers as well as fails in what it sets out to do.<br /><br />The story has unexpected turns but the pacing and the story structure is flawed. The cast give an awesome performance again but only to loose out to non effective translation of the TV show's storytelling and mood onto the big screen.<br /><br />It is still good to see the story of 'Firely' come to some conclusion.
B00005ATQD|1.0|[...], I would.  My friend forced me to watch this movie and I can understand why he likes it: it's nothing but naked women, naked women, and more naked women.  Nicole Kidman was so melodramatic, Tom Cruise wasn't much better - the characters had no redeeming qualities...I really didn't care about what happened to any of them.  And I never did figure out the point of the movie.  This movie is basically a cleaned up porno, but I daresay that even a porn would have a more interesting plotline...

It's a benevolent movie!<br /><br />The film depicts another side of real love irregardless of what interfering irrelevant segments of society would have us believe is dirty and sinful!<br /><br />It's quite the oposite. No honest love is EVER wrong!<br /><br />It's a disturbingly honest film proving the interferering right wing folks are accountable and exposes their real blasphemy!!!<br /><br />I am not surprised it didn't win the Oscar.

B000002AQQ|4.0|Hi all, I've just been reading through the reviews and saw one that made me laugh at the stupidity of some: this one was credited to a guy who calls himself Music Man - so to quote verbatim  <br /> <br />\\"THIS MAY BE A GOOD SOUNDTRACK, BUT WHAT THE HELL..I'VE SEEN THIS FILM A HUNDRED TIMES, AND I NEVER FROGOT THAT SONG WHEN HE WAS RIDING IN THE HELECOPTOR ON THE WAY TO VIETNAM.I COULDNT REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE SONG AND FORGOT WHO THE ARTIST WAS.SO I SEARCHED ON THE CRAPPY INTERNET.... FOR OVER AN HOUR MY POOR TUSH HURTS, AND I FOUND NOTHING, AND IT'S A CLASSIC SONG!!!!! SO I THOUGHT TO MYSELF MY BROTHER MIGHT KNOW, SO I SAID TO HIM, REMEMBER FORREST GUMP WHEN HE WAS IN THE HELECOPTOR AND THE SONG WENT \\"THERE MUST BE SOME WAY OUTTA HERE\\" AND IMMEDIATELY HE SAID JIMI HENDRIX, ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER.... SHAME SHAME WHOEVER PUT TOGETHER THIS SOUNDTRACK NEEDS TO BE SMACKED UPSIDE THE HEAD.. WHO WOULD FORGET JIMI, AND THAT BEAUTIFUL CLASSIC SONG. NOW I KNOW, NO WONDER I COULDNT FIND IT. IT AINT EVEN ON HERE! AFTER ALL THOSE CLIPS I LISTENED TO. WASTE OF TIME, PLUS WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT TO JIMI FANS\\" -  <br /> <br />so Music Man, you've seen the film a hundred times and you've never forgotten the song, however, in the next sentence you counter that statement by saying that you have indeed forgotten it, or at least who the artist was! But alas, later in your tirade, you inquire as to \\"who would forget Jimi, and that beautiful classic song\\" - well you for one mate and to vent your spleen, what instrument did you use - the crappy internet.  <br /> <br />Its not a disappointment for Jimi fans, because they probably have the track at least a dozen times over what with all the greatest hits and re-releases etc. <br /> <br />The owners of recording rights etc, whilst quite happy to have their music in films, do not allow the tracks to be used on the released soundtrack - this is mainly because of the way in which royalties are paid and the company/person feels that there is more to gain by not allowing the release of their work. <br /> <br />If someone really wants to find the music, they will. <br />

B000DZIGDU|3.0|i have never been so disappointed in a movie.  this is an over-lapping documentary.  the violence is beyond belief and these guys never get into the war.  the first part of this movie is a documentary on the marine corps.  the second part is a documentary on the first gulf war, desert shield.  the best i can say about jarhead is the acting is superb.  basically there  is no storyline.  given the fact that the war itself seems to be an afterthought this is an extremely violent, bloody, piece of filmmaking. in my opinion this rates three stars even though i didn't care for it.  perhaps all the hype.  i would have liked to have seen some interviews with the stars at the end of the movie.  they pay these people a fortune to act or react and i have no way of knowing but i would bet these stars feel it is a come down to be interviewed about the movie they just starred in.  jake gyllenhaal is my favorite actor and he did another outstanding job on this movie.  for me, there is just too much violence in this movie and as i said it is nothing more then a documentary on the marine corps. and the war.  the story, if there was one, was awful.  good luck and rent, don't buy this one.  right now i await the movie, brokeback mtn. and with all the hype i can only hope.

You can read it to understand the rules of driving but don't want to start driving by yourself, atleast if you want to avoid the accidents!

Now, do you want to start driving without going through the Instructor first? If the answer is NO, then, after understanding the C++ syntax, you want to read the 'Effective C++' book before starting the real design and programming in C++.

0553801503|5.0|The War of the Five Kings is drawing to a close, while an even greater war is brewing. \\"A Feast for Crows\\" takes place during this slow period between the two major wars. Martin's fourth \\"Ice and Fire\\" novel shares more similarities with his first than it does with his second or third. Just as \\"A Game of Thrones\\" was mostly about setting things up for the next two novels, so is this one. <br /> <br />Which isn't to say the book is uneventful, but if you're expecting it to be as action-packed as \\"A Storm of Swords\\" you'll be disappointed. There's still plenty going on to make the book interesting. Dorne's responding to the murder of Prince Oberyn, Riverrun is under siege from the Freys, Storm's End is under siege from the Tyrells, the Iron Islands are struggling to appoint a new Lord, the Vale is reacting to the murder of its Lady, and the people of Highgarden are struggling to deal with the Queen Regent. Though Tommen sits on the Iron Throne, Cersei Lannister is the one truly ruling the realm. <br /> <br />Martin's writing style - already great in the past books - has gotten even better in this one. His style is often elegant and clever at the same time. Like all the other books, \\"Feast\\" features an ensemble cast, but it's notable how the series has gradually moved away from the Starks since beginning. The first book spent about 80% of its time on House Stark and its members. This latest book spends at most 15% of its time on the Starks. <br /> <br />The only major complaint I have is with Brienne. Except for her very last one, Brienne's chapters are a waste of time and paper. Whereas, all the other characters were very gripping and entertaining, Brienne was downright boring. It didn't take long for me to get so bored with her chapters, that I started skipping them. After I finished the book, I went back and read them all, and well, I'm really not sorry for skipping them. <br /> <br />More than a few reviewers have complained about the fact that this volume is missing characters, but those who were following along on Martin's site know there's good reason for that. By the time A Feast for Crows reached 1300 manuscript pages in length, Martin still wasn't finished with the story. The story was far too big to publish in one book, so Martin's only options were: a) to cut A Feast for Crows right at the mid-way point and publish it Volumes 1 & 2, or b) to cut out some of the characters' stories and move them into A Dance with Dragons. Every good story requires a beginning, a middle, a climax, and an ending; had Martin had taken the first approach, the story would have a beginning and a middle, but no climax and no real ending. At least with this approach, the story has *some* closure. So, yes, the story is missing characters - Tyrion, Dany, Jon, Bran, Davos, and Stannis, among others - but they'll be back next year for A Dance with Dragons, the parallel novel to A Feast for Crows. <br /> <br />Overall, this is one of the greatest books I've ever read. Five years was a long time to wait, but it was well worth it. H.L. Mencken once said, \\"The primary aim of the novel, at all times and everywhere, is the representation of human beings at their follies and villainies, and no other art form clings to that aim so faithfully.\\" His quote perfectly captures the underlying theme of Martin's series. At heart, A Song of Ice and Fire is about war and human brutality; about how so many want power, and the terrible things they'll do to achieve it, sending thousands of men to their deaths and bringing death and destruction upon a whole country just to achieve power.  <br />

0307276902|1.0|I read this book while on vacation, knowing that it is a work of fiction that James Frey initially masqueraded as a non-fiction biography.  I thought I might still get a lot out of it, and just think of it as fiction.  I didn't.  It is poorly written.  There are some nice character developments, but the language just doesn't flow.  And throughout the book I felt angry that he would target vulnerable people, con and manipulate them and use them. He made millions of dollars from unsuspecting readers, and who knows how many people have drawn away from AA and an effective recovery program because they believe his made-up experience.  He is the salesperson who knowingly sells you a lemon--definitely not the real deal.  Even after being confronted, he did not grasp the difference between truth and fiction.  Thank goodness thesmokinggun.com started investigating his legal claims and blew the whistle on him.  Perhaps if he had lowered himself to use the twelve step recovery program, he would have confronted his own patterns and done something to change them.  As it is I believe that his lies trivialize the incredible journey that real-life recovering addicts take.  Do not support this man.  Do not buy this book
B000BT97AO|3.0|Mirror Mask is an inventive beautiful film that leaves one with mixed feelings after viewing. The inclusion of Dave Mckean's artwork into a feature is enough to lure any artisan and one that I'd been looking forward to seeing for quite sometime. But sadly, in the end we are left with a confusing storyline, confused characters, a music score that easily causes one's eyes to weigh heavy and a bit too much to look at to the point of an over busy film look & feel. So many things pass by and happen so fast that none are ever truly absorbed. Some scenes I found it hard to make it out  what I was looking at. It certainly introduces original characters, and original ideas, though some of them were just a bit to CGI looking to buy into.<br /><br />At times, I was distracted by the dated look of some of the computer animation. All in all, it requires a few viewings to appreciate the art of it, though my guess is it will not stick with most American audiences. It certainly was an inventive attempt, though I think much can be learned from it - to deliver better on the next go-around. - A script that translates better, and more art design applied to real world objects than CGI<br /><br />(Eyesofchaos dot com)
B000BJS4SU|5.0|I knew I was in for something great when I ordered Try! and now that I have listened to it 5 or 6 times I am convinced. I'm a huge John Mayer fan and I was a little weird about him starting up a trio... but John Mayer, Steve Jordan and Pino Palladino make beautiful music together. Gravity and And Another Kind of Green are my favorites. But I guarantee the rest of the tracks on this cd are just as good. The music will work it's way into you.
B00007KKZY|5.0|It's a beautiful thing when someone has a skill or a talent which is readily accessible. Such is the case with Barbra Streisand. Until hearing this CD I had never really appreciated the skill and talent of Barbra. Inadvertently this CD compares Barbra with many of the top voices of today and yesterday, and it became apparent to me that Barbra has a very powerful and very beautiful voice.<br /><br />Historically I have listened to very little of Barbra's music; my mistake. Barbra has an exceptionally powerful and melodic voice. I've considered Celine Dion to have one of the most powerful voices in music today. When I listened to the \\"Tell Him\\" duet with Celine Dion, I realized that Barbra's voice is even more powerful than Celine Dion's. Celine's notes are more pure, but Barbra has harmonics and strength in her voice that could overwhelm Celine's. However, the song uses the best features of each vocalist to create an incomparable vocal experience. This song will send chills down your spine.<br /><br />Given that I only have 1000 words to describe 19 songs, I am unable to fully describe the experience of each and every one, which I would love to do. Instead, I'll point to some highlights.<br /><br />\\"Guilty\\" and \\"What Kind of Fool\\" with Barry Gibb are absolutely inspired duets. Barry's falsetto is a brilliant counterpoint to Barbra's voice. Eliminate the instruments, they are unnecessary. I could listen to an entire CD of music like this, both of which were big hits.<br /><br />Who can forget \\"You Don't Bring Me Flowers\\" with Neil Diamond? These two singers sound so much like actual lovers that you want to cry. Enough said.<br /><br />\\"I've Got a Crush on You\\" with Frank Sinatra is a tribute by Frank and Barbra to each other and the place each holds as musical greats. Such an understated, but gorgeously performed tune, so simple and elegant; this is music from a time gone by.<br /><br />There are several interesting pairings on this CD that make you wonder until you hear them; for example, the duet with Kim Carnes, with her earthy voice. But when you hear the two sing, it's magic. Another interesting pairing is the duet with Kris Kristofferson. Kris never sounded so good (thank you Barbra!). Considering I've always thought of Don Johnson as an actor, the duet with him could have sounded like an expensive stereo next to a pocket radio. However, Don pretty much holds his own in this song. In each of these duets I think that Barbra makes the song, but the contrast with the other singer works in each case.<br /><br />A couple of songs on this CD do not work well. At this risk of offending someone, the one I think that works the least is the duet with Barry Manilow. While Barry's voice works fine by himself, Barbra overwhelms him in \\"I Won't Be the One to Let Go.\\"<br /><br />The other criticism I've heard about this CD is that much of the music hear is duplicated elsewhere in various separate formats, and there is very little that is new music. Thus Barbra's superfans end up with multiple copies of the same music. Given that I have almost no Barbra Streisand music (shame on me) this CD is outstanding to me. For those of you who would buy anything by Barbra, please forgive her for the sake of neophytes like me that are just discovering how incredibly well she sings.<br /><br />A song by Barbra generally focuses on the vocals. Her voice and the voice of her partner in each of these songs are at the forefront. The music is in a supporting role. This kind of music is meant to be a vocal experience, and not an instrument experience. Frequently you will find the instruments could have readily been eliminated; the voices are musical instruments themselves. The music is generally mellow pop, with an occasional deviation toward a slightly heavier direction (such as the vocal with Kim Carnes), and just as often a deviation toward Broadway or classic tunes. However, if you like Barbra's voice, you'll enjoy each and every selection on this 5 star CD. If you like music by artists such as Celine Dion, Charlotte Church, Diana Krall, and Norah Jones because you like the vocals, likely you will find this CD will match your tastes.<br /><br />This particular CD is imported from Japan.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|i bought these because i loved the movie \\"serenity\\".  every episode is like watching the movie, they are all that good.  i don't know why this show didn't get better ratings, it must have just been ahead of its time.  once again joss whedon is amazing.  i never should have doubted him. i should have watched these from day one.
0062502182|4.0|This work is meant for sharing!  It began as a selection in my girlfriend's book club.  She read part of it to me while traveling out of town. I immediately finished it early the next morning and proceded to order a copy for myself, my daughter and my brother. It IS that good! <br />    Some have compared it to \\"Candide\\", \\"Siddhartha\\" and \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\".  I wouldn't go quite that far but for anyone examining their own life, etc. \\"The Alchemist\\" is a must read along with those other noteable titles.  Please- read it. Enjoy it. And, share it!
B000EOTAM6|1.0|There is nothing new here..the acting is poor,the plot is ....well there is no plot,what a poor poor film.    special effects are good by not spectacular.    Big budget folly.    This is bad...not recommended.
6305280762|5.0|Few movies are today that show us what it means to be creative, visionary and resourceful. The Towering inferno is like that, something new, not yet copied or matched, hard, but a t the same time human and with hope to the future, really a good movie for all time.
0596009208|3.0|I think it is a good book. not too deep, but is fun to read. <br /> <br />So I give three stars.
B00000I14Z|5.0|1 of 3-5 star lps- (see \\"Blues and Roots\\" and \\"Dynasty\\") issued by Mingus in 50's.  All his own compositions, the song flow is unparalleled.  No song can be called better than another, but, of course, we all favor some.  Listen to his eloquent 'Goodbye Pork Pie Hat' Charlie's tribute to lester young.  Check out 'Fables of Faubus; and think about.... CIVIL RIGHTS!  Overwhelming opening funk/jazz piece \\"Better Git It In Your Soul\\"  Mingus was certainly a master composer, creator, artist and a central link, between at most, 2 other great jazz composers.  Buying this cd is a 'no brainer' for anyone of an age that knows what was, is and will be good for as long as we have ears.  Companion cd is \\"Dynasty\\".  The man who entitled his auto-biography \\"Beneath the Underdog\\" still gets way too little respect.
B0000027I6|5.0|I am a little miffed as I type this for reviewing something I SHOULD have had for years.  This is a complete masterpiece.  One of the greatest concept albums ever.  No need to go hunting for good tracks.  In fact, every time I have listened to it, its been from start to finish....there just isnt a bad track and it flows so nicely.  Reading through the lyrics in the booklet would give plenty of satisfaction for 10 dollars...but then to have Roger song them, with such a sense of timing and effective nuances, is just so special.  Cynical doesnt begin to decribe it.  At times you just have to grin and shake your head in wonderment.  Having said all that, if you're looking for another Floyd album, this doesnt fit the bill.  However, it is every bit as moving as The Wall.
0307276902|1.0|I only read a few pages and it started out to be a very good read.  I put the book down planning on reading it for the up coming rainy weekend, then the very next day it came out that the author had made up most of all the details in the book.  It spoiled it for me because I thought it was a true story based on his life.  I have not picked the book up since.
B000060P79|1.0|You know how when your little sister or brother is watching barney on TV, and you over here a song and it gets stuck in you head for days. This is very much like that. It painfully plays all day long in your head while you screem inside your mind \\"MAKE IT STOP!!!\\". The facts that kids my age (17) actually listen to this stuff really makes me kinda shocked. No I'm not making fun of anyone, but this IS pretty childish stuff. Its actually sad. I wonder if the people who listen to this are like Peter Pan or something on the inside. I mean common, they said it themselves \\"I dont wanna be told to grow up.\\" This should speak for itself. I dont usually like to band music, but you really shouldn't own this if you are over 12.
B00065MDRW|5.0|I lost this record many years ago and just looking at the cover made me feel sad. The power of this record takes you to the darkest corners of your soul. Big fan, what can I say. Amazing.
0393061310|4.0|\\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" provides a very interesting perspective on history and helps explain why the West has come to dominate the world.  However, in the process he strains to avoid including the impact of anything possibly \\"racist\\" - eg. differences in culture or physiology.<br /><br />Diamond's main point is that ability to cultivate crops and tend herds (determined by geography and available native species) allows setting aside resources for innovation and war.  Germs acquired from domestic animals then played decisive roles in the European conquests of Native Americans, Australians, South Africans, and Pacific Islanders.  Animal-based means of transporting food surpluses were also a pre-requisite for development of technologically innovative societies.<br /><br />Factors Encouraging Farming:  Declining availability of wild foods, development of methods to harvest (eg. flint blades attached to handles, for harvesting; baskets; mortars and pestles to remove husks).  Cereals were a first crop.  The best area for this at the time was the Fertile Crescent.<br /><br />Factors in Domesticating Animals:  Carnivores are too inefficient, want a fast growth rate (rules out monkeys, apes, elephants), easy breeding (rules out vicunas), good disposition (rules out African buffalo, hippos, zebras), limited panic tendency (rules out gazelles), herdable (rules out antelope - males fight when confined).<br /><br />Another key Diamond point is that domesticated plants spread faster across Europe-Asia because of the long distances at similar latitudes.  Conversely, Africa and the America's longest distances are primarily north-south, posing greater difficulty because of the great climate differences.  In addition, the dry Texas area acted as a barrier between the SE and SW U.S. for transmitting crop-growing lessons.<br /><br />Diamond then concludes that the long East-West axis across Europe-Asia helped spread the development of the wheel for transporting crops, and writing (helped in trade).  Meanwhile, the prehistoric Mexico's wheel and early writing systems never made it to the Andes.<br /><br />Some areas (eg. Australia, and the Western U.S.) did not have readily domesticatable crops.<br /><br />Major killers of humanity throughout recent history - smallpox, flu, TB, malaria, plague, measles, and cholera - are infectious diseases evolved from diseases of animals, according to Diamond.  Until WWII, more victims of war died of war-borne microbes than battle wounds.  Diamond goes on to assert that agriculture led to greater disease because of higher population densities, use of feces as fertilizer, disease transmitting rodents attracted by stored food, and transmission along resulting trade routes.<br /><br />Smallpox gave the Spaniards in America a decisive advantage - from 1520 to 1618 Mexico's population fell from about 20 million to about 1.6 million.  For the New World as a whole, the Indian population decline in the two centuries post-Columbus was about 95%.  Indians did not have diseases to transmit back to Europe because they had much fewer animals, did not drink their milk, and did not keep them indoors.  (Eurasia had 13 species of big domestic mammals - some also useful for cultivation, and the Americas just one very local species - the llama, confined to a small area in South America.)  However, tropical Asia, Africa, Indonesia, and New Guinea had cholera and yellow fever - making those areas much more difficult to colonize.<br /><br />Acceptance of change is another important factor - Islam, until about 1350 led Europe, until its religion began holding it back.  (Diamond also mentions later that inhabitants of the Fertile Crescent undid their agricultural advantage by cutting down trees, allowing the sandy soil to become a major enemy.)  Similarly, China formerly led the world in technology and ship-building, but then regressed under subsequent inward-focused leadership.<br /><br />Food production increases population size andalso acts to make societies more complex.  For example, Diamond believes that a large society that leaves conflict resolution to members is guaranteed to blow up.  A second reason involves economic and welfare considerations - goods in excess of an individual's needs must be transferred to a centralized authority, which then redistributes these to individuals with deficits.<br /><br />Overall, Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" provides interesting insights into early world history; however, I strongly suspect Diamond's efforts to be politically correct limited his insights.also acts to make societies more complex.

B00004ZDVQ|5.0|If this music doesn't make you get out of your chair, nothing will!  Not only are the CDs filled with big hits, but even the less widely known tunes will get your heart pounding.  Great for reminiscing, great for exercising, great for making work go faster...just GREAT!
B00005JO9J|5.0|I love the Grey's Anatomy DVD, as soon as I got it I sat down to play around with it and ending up watching the whole second disc. It is truly what every fan wants. It makes you feel like you are really friends with the doctor's and I can't get enough.
0393327655|4.0|The book was a little pedantic in places but the basic premise is right on and it paints a very dim view of our ability to work out a viable peace in the middle east as how can you reason with people whose whole world view as based on not an ounce of reason.
076113719X|5.0|As a mom of 2 very busy kids I find this calendar to be very helpful in keeping their (and my) schedules straight.  The calendar has a column for 5 people - or as in our case, one for the dog.
1563894696|5.0|While I tend to focus more on Marvel Comics, I vastly like the idea of Batman.  The character, the history, and even the rogues' gallery are all very intriguing to me, though I haven't read too many actual Batman comics (so far, most of my knowledge comes from the movies and from friends).  The Long Halloween is something that I've been meaning to read for some time now, because it is considered by many to be one of the greatest Batman stories in existence, which is a true honor (from what I've heard, there are some amazing Batman books as well as some that should be burned).  At long last, I finally read The Long Halloween, and I couldn't be happier. <br />Some spoilers to follow <br />Taking place very early on in Batman's career, The Long Halloween tells the story of a serial killer known as Holiday.  Starting on October 31st and ending on the following October 31st, Holiday kills every month on a national holiday, including Thanksgiving, Christmas, St. Patrick's Day, and Independence Day.  Most of the targets are associates and family members of Carmine \\"The Roman\\" Falcone (introduced in Frank Miller's Batman: Year One).  Falcone is the mob boss currently in control of the crime-ridden Gotham City, and it appears that someone is out to end his reign.  Batman, Police Captain James Gordan, and District Attorney Harvey Dent have formed an alliance to put an end to Falcone's empire themselves, but Holiday is making things tough for them, because as much as they want Falcone out, they want it done legally. <br />Furthermore, the emerging supervillains that eventually become Batman's rogues' gallery begin giving Batman some trouble.  The Joker claims that Gotham isn't big enough for two psychotic murderers and, in an attempt to kill Holiday, tries to release his toxic gas on a crowded square in the center of downtown Gotham, while Catwoman tends to show up and ruin things for Batman whenever he gets close to Falcone.  It doesn't help that Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle (Batman and Catwoman) are in a relationship, and yet neither knows that they are fighting each other when they meet as their alter egos.  Even Falcone hires villains like Poison Ivy, the Riddler, and the Scarecrow to get some of his dirty work done.  And by the end, Two-Face is born from Harvey Dent, taking Batman's friend away forever. <br />The Long Halloween serves as the transition of power from the mob goons to the supervillains in Gotham as well as a retelling of Two-Face's origin.  It is also a very well-told noir detective story (after all, Batman is the world's greatest detective).  Jeph Loeb masterfully tells his story of Dent's descent into madness, the fall of Falcone, and the very gray nature of Batman and Gordan's \\"victory\\".  The twists are also completely unexpected.  Just when you think that you've figured out who Holiday is, the rug is pulled out from under you (I thought I figured it out, and I sort of did, until the final twist is revealed).  Furthermore, the art is perfect for the book.  When I first picked up The Long Halloween, I was a little put off by the art, but as I started to read the book, I realized that the style of art perfectly fit the story. <br />This is a must-read for any Batman fan.  It is a great story for anyone; no prior knowledge of the characters is required (in fact, it helps set up certain characters' personalities), and it involves nearly every major Batman villain imaginable.  Also, this is one of the stories that served as inspiration for the amazing Batman Begins film.  Batman doesn't get much better than this.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I loved being able to see the series in a digital format rather than receiving it via television!  It is so much better!  The extras were worth it, ten times over.  For anyone who likes sci-fi with a twist, this is the way to go!
B00005JNQA|3.0|The Interpreter is nothing to write home about. Sydney Pollack's thriller suffers from a bit of an identity crisis - does it want to be a Hitchcock suspenser, conspiracy thriller, character piece, morality play or poltical drama? To which the answer is, probably. Throwing away its Hitchcockian premise, it wears the conspiracy clothes most comfortably, but the plot is easily guessed thanks to two massively unsubtle hints and, aside from a good sequence on a bus, builds up to what would be a serious anticlimax if the rest of the film were any better. Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn, the latter looking like a bizarre deflated hybrid of Walter Matthau, Dustin Hoffman and Pollack himself here, do ok by their cliched parts and the casting of Earl Cameron, one time elder statesman of British race-relations pictures like Sapphire and Flame in the Streets, as the Mugabe-like liberator-turned-dictator is clever. It's watchable in a once-only way, but it's a long way from the quality of Three Days of the Condor. Next time, guys, finish the script before starting shooting.
B00005JNX0|5.0|I watched the movie with a 4 year old.  It was enough on his level that he got it and it had enough adult humor to keep my attention.
B0001XALT6|4.0|James Mangold's Copland was a victim of ridiculously high expectations on its release, but seen away from the hype it's a satisfying modern Western fable with Sylvester Stallone's half‑deaf, rather slow on the uptake sheriff slowly realising that his town of New York cops is a nest of murderous corruption. It all ends in a showdown that makes imaginative use of sound but left the critics expecting something more cerebral floundering. Stallone and Ray Liotta are exceptionally good in a strong cast, with only Robert De Niro turning in a phoney and predictable slice of by-the-numbers hamming (\\"Go-TO-lunch! Go-TO-lunch!\\"). The director's cut doesn't add a great deal - the racial subpliot is still relegated to the deleted scenes bin - and the new sound mix unfortunately loses one great use of sound (when Stallone plays records, in the old cut he could only hear them in mono), but unlike more and more recent directors' cuts it doesn't weaken the film either.<br /><br />The extras aren't plentiful, but they are god: an engaging audio commentary, two deleted scenes, a good featurette and a storyboard comparison.
B00092ZMDY|3.0|Didn't these guys used to play their own instruments? If it wasn't for all the backup musicians what would these guys do?, use prerecorded backing tracks? It used to be if the backing musicians outnumbered the actual band then you suffered the fate of the Monkees and were ridiculed for being a make-believe rock band. Nowadays the Eagles could care less about playing guitars. My guess is that their best musician, Don Felder got booted out for demanding that they give up their nostalgia act and get back to making and playing new songs. Simply put, this show is 90% slow vocal harmonies and 10% rock. If thats your idea of a good show then be my guest.
0967851408|5.0|This book by Charles F. Haanel is clearly a masterpiece of thought provoking work by a true master of 'thinking'. Mr Haanel delivers an excellent read on the art or science of thinking and mastering the keys to self awareness for anything you can imagine.  <br />I would recommend this book to anyone in any walk of life at any age. It is intended for a more mature audience and looks at the very seeds of our thoughts and how we can achieve our lifes goals through the seeds of our very own self maintained thinking. <br /> <br />Get it. Your money will be very well spent.
B000002NC4|4.0|I was totally in love with 'There's Nothing Wrong With Love' when it came out but was dissappointed by the songs I heard from 'Perfect From Now On' I heard on the radio. They seemed longwinded, boring and not as short and fresh as I was used to. <br /> <br />10 years later I gave it another try and was glad I did. <br /> <br />Maybe it's maturity and patience. The songlength at first scared me but I am proven wrong. A song like 'I Would Hurt A Fly' could easily have been more than one song since the last 2,5 minutes are completely different, something they have done before and would continue doing after this album on the even more brilliant 'Keep It Like A Secret'. <br /> <br />The same happens in 'Stop The Show' which has a 2 minute intro before the song bursts loose and then changes again around minute 5!. And this continues on the entire album. <br /> <br />It's not their easiest album to listen to and certainly not the most fun. But it's very rewarding to listen to the richness of sounds, melodies, riffs etc that are all in one song.  <br /> <br />Again Martsch has shown to be an absolute genius in the indiemusic world.
B00003CXI1|5.0|they did such a wonderful job with turning this into a movie from a book it has the feel the  exicitement the magical creatures characters and places it shows the vision on the screen to how i picture it in my head i give it five stars cause they have everything correct about the story in it about harry getting dropped off at his aunt and uncle's by dumbledore,mcgonnagal and hagrid and then growing up along side dudley and harry not knowing he is a wizard and making odd things happen until hagrid the half giant comes and tells him he is a wizard and then he goes gets all his hogwarts supplies and then goes on the hogwarts express to  his new school of witchcraft and wizardry and meets      up with his classmates and finds out who his friends are and gets  sorted into gryffindor he also meets his enemies like draco,crabbe and goyle.then a teacher that loathes him so much but he doesnt know why then he makes the gryffindor quidditch  team and thinks who is trying to take the sorcerer's stone actually is not so pick up this dvd and all the harry potter books and get lost in the world of harry potter like i have and enjoy all the places,creatures,characters,adventures,and magical fanatsy and imagination that is harry potter.
B000BYA4JM|4.0|I am so glad Who's that girl is finally on Dvd.I have waited many years for it to come out and it was worth the wait. I recommend this movie to Madonna fans and also If you're a new madonna fan, watch this first or second. Madonna has some funny lines and scenes and it's one of my personal favorites along with Desperately Seeking Susan and A league of their own.
B00003CWTI|5.0|I like it very much. It's well played, above all, and you feel close to the characters and at the same time, you're entertained by the sometimes extreme destinies they meet. <br />It's deep, but not disturbingly. It's fun, but sad.
B000DN5W4I|4.0|I gotta tell ya, I bought the new DVD and I am somewhat dissapointed.. While the show is great, the editing is horrendous. Who is responsible for that? It jumps around worse than an MTV video.. <br /> <br />Why does it have to be so busy? Shot from all angles except for upside down from what I could see. It is very difficult to watch for any length of time in my opinion..  Joe would be doing a grea solo and they are showing either the audience or Eric playing the bass or the drummer while Joe is blisterig the guitar. That happened on more than one occassion..  I thought it might just be me, but when I played the DVD for some friends they said the same thing without my commenting my thoughts first.. <br /> <br />The first DVD was the same way, so I was hoping that the second one would be different, but I think it might be worse.. What a shame that a great show would be ruined in the editing room or by the camera crew.  <br /> <br />Maybe I am too old(52) for the new style of video taping a concert. What is wrong with just showing the band with subtle camera angles and fade shots that don't detract from the band itself?  <br /> <br />Check out the way Scorcese shot \\"The Last Waltz\\" or watch Tommy Castro's new DVD... now those shows are great to watch... Just show me the band, I don't need to see how fancy the editing equipment is or how creative the video editor can be. <br /> <br />Sincerely, <br />Marc Rutrough <br />Street Team Member
B0000025YL|4.0|This rocks.<br /><br />It starts out with weird German folk music and quickly seques into weird German screaming. And I mean that in the nicest possible way.<br /><br />Anybody at all wanting to find out about this band and to see what a huge influence they were on later European bands should grab this album and Balls to the Wall.<br /><br />Tracks like Fast As A Shark and the title track just rip. Udo is in fine form and could the guitars get any more synchomeshed. Demons Nihgt and Flash Rockin' Man - I could name just about every track here. Get stuck into it!
1594200696|5.0|The Elements of Style has long been a staple for writers. Now the book adds an element of humor in the delightful drawings by its illustrator. The rules are just as helpful as they have been for decades. The illustrations bring the written examples to life. They're bright, sunny, funny, and fun.
B00005NTP2|3.0|Europe bounced back from the unpleasantness that was 'Out of This World' and came up with this far better effort. This album starts off solidly enough with teeny bopper hard rock like All or Nothing and Halfway to Heaven. It gets a bit sickly sweet with I'll Cry for You and Little Bit of Lovin but even these and equally shaky stuff like Talk to Me do get the job done in a very polite way<br /><br />The instrumentation was more varied this time, Beau Hill making this a very shiny beast with his production and the story was that instead of Joey Tempest doing all the writing the others had more input into this album. The way this band was reaching out yet staying within the rather limp confines of 80's hard rock for 15 year old girls is somewhat interesting. Any fan of this band who got scared off by Out of this World really should pick this up. If they don't, then they are missing out on some of Europes tastiest cuts - which litter 'side two' of this CD.<br /><br />Seventh Sign shows some maturity, Prisoners in Paradise is melancholy sadness (aimed at people who haven't really experienced it yet though) and then there are some fun rock 'n' roll tunes like Bad Blood and Got Your Mind in the Gutter.<br /><br />Special mention too for track 12 - Girl from Lebanon. Though again we have a very lightweight take on what could of been an interesting topic.<br /><br />Which is part of the problem. Very little grunt, very little balls and when the engine starts up it asks permission first. Nothing like Scream of Anger here chaps.....
B0000029AL|5.0|This album is absolutely GREAT. It is one of my favourites of all-time alnog with the Scorpions \\"In Trance\\" and Led Zeppelin's \\"IV\\". It rocks from the very beginning to the very end - an absoulute masterpiece of brilliant musicanship. <br />Some of you may think perhaps that I do not know much about this band if I rate this one so high; because it is clearly not their best one both in opinion of fans and critics. <br />But no, I do have almost every Aerosmith's LP.  <br />\\"Rocks\\" and \\"Toys int he Attic\\" were good indeed, thier 80's/90's efforts as well, but somehow this one appeals to me the most. It is so raw, crude, simple and uncouth. It stems directly from blues-inspired stuff and is so blissfully liberated from the compulsion of being radio-minded, so untouched by mainstream popular influences and ripped off any commercial attempts to appeal to vast audience - and hence so incredibly marvellous. These guys sound like they were playing for themselves only, and they'd screw both fame, record-sales and radio-appeal. I can't get enough of listening to this one.  <br />\\"One way street\\" is a 7 minute classic - something you must hear before you can proclaim yourself a music-knower. <br />I've always held Aerosmith for a very good band, altough they probably weren't as talented as my favourites Bon Jovi; not to mention Led Zeppelin or Guns N Roses. They made a great deal of really good albums, altough some of their songs really do not appeal to me at all (for example \\"Back in the saddle\\"). But all in all, this is one of the better rock bands I've come across so far. <br />This debut-album is absoultely my favourite one - however, I would'nt recommend it for a newcomer, since this one differes greatly from most later Aersomith records. Just compare this with \\"Pump\\" or \\"Nine Lives\\" - you'll get the difference. So, a casual listener who happened to have heard this band on the radio would get here a completely different band he might expect. However, if you have a nice CDcollection on your desk (I have over 300), you'll gradually be trying to get into such overlooked masterpieces as this one and discover what most listeners didn't. That's really fun, when everybody keeps saying how good was something that sold 10 million copies and everyone owns it.   <br />This one is perhaps one of the best LP's of all time... Highly recommended as a top-gem in your CD collection.

B0000024K1|4.0|This is generally regarded as Public Enemy's best album.  It's easy to see why, because it does feature many of their best songs.  Like \\"Bring the Noise\\", \\"Don't Believe the Hype\\" and \\"She Watch Channel Zero\\".  Believe the hype.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Excellent movie.  It can be seen by the whole family.
B000002J3W|5.0|Skid Row was, to me, an Irish guitar boogie band from the late 60s (just like fellow Irishmen Taste and Thin Lizzy at that time) with Gary Moore on guitar. When I first heard about the new, 80s American Skid Row, I really wasn't interested in what I heard - poodle metal? Not until I read about 'Subhuman race' being something else than what they've accomplished before...and boy, is it something else!  <br /> <br />'Subhuman race' reminds me of the first two, great albums with Megadeath; hard rockin' songs with an emphasis on a heavy jungle beat, hysterical singing and great rhythms, as well as wild guitars. Highly recommended!

B000957O82|5.0|I really only saw 3 movies that were made in 2005 and all 3 were very good I thought. The others I watched were the 40 Year Old Virgin and also The Wedding Crashers. I liked this movie because Will Smith did a very good job against. He plays a dude who was once a huge looser and then becomes Mr. Hip and gives men tips on how to pick up women as relationships and not just sex.He goes to talk to a guy Kevin James who wants a women who is a smart heiress that is a tributary for the company that he works for. He is a really big dork and Will gets him hooked up. Meanwhile Will falls for a girl that is a newspaper worker. He is not Mr.Smooth he fails on a date with her at Ellis Island and also at a cookout. She finds out that he sets up men with women and thinks it is just about sex but it is not that at all. <br />So Will gets her back by being a huge moron instead of smooth.
B00005JO9J|4.0|Season 1 of Grey's Anatomy is amazing. It reminds us of why we love the show in the first place. I love the extras and all those great deleted scenes! If you just got into the show recently, you'd be crazy not to get the first season to see how it all got started.

His job is to stand up for tobacco companies that are being attacked by knuckleheads who accuse the businesses of being murdering bastards. Talyor loves what he does, and he's very good at it. He is able to attack his opponents from every angle imaginable. But as clever as he is, he never observes the fact that smoking is essentially long term suicide, and that some people who do smoke are too dumb to make an attempt to quit.  <br /> <br />As a conservative Republican, I think that the attack on the tobacco industry is just as ridiculous as the attacks on gun manufacturers and McDonald's. Some may remember the outrageous lawsuit a number of years ago in which a woman spilled hot McDonald's coffee all over herself, sued the establishment, and won. But it get's better. Now obese people are taking McDonald's to court. Obese people aren't obese because of McDonald's. They are obese because they choose not to burn away the calories or because of their inescapable genetic makeup. In \\"Super Size Me,\\" the great 2004 documentary by filmmaker Morgan Spurlock, we were educated on the theory that there is a point where corporate responsibility ends and personal responsibility begins. Corporate responsibility ends at the cash register, and personal responsiblity begins when you digest the food.  <br /> <br />The same aspect applies to the gun industry, and in 2003, the endlessly fascinating \\"Runaway Jury,\\" which was based on a novel by John Grisham, explored lawsuits against the gun industry. Although I disagreed with the outcome, I still gave the film four stars, but the bottom line is simple: companies aren't responsible for what their products do to people, especially by other people. A hopeless dote who blows his co-workers away can't be controled by the gun company that he purchased the firearm from. In the same way, a smoker should not be allowedto sue a tobacco company for hospital treatment for lung cancer. Any judge with a brain would dismiss the case immediately, give the plaintiff a middle finger, and wish him luck on his journey up the creek without a canoe or a paddle.  <br /> <br />\\"Runaway Jury\\" and \\"Super Size Me\\" were answers to the ridiculous arguments against corporations. \\"Thank You For Smoking\\" is more of a hokey outcry rather than an answer. When Nick Taylor stands up for what he believes in, he is more than certain that he is right. He is just as determined as Uri Orlov from last year's excellent \\"Lord of War,\\" who sold illegal arms to every army but the Salvation Army. Taylor is an orator, no more, no less. He is payed to talk, and tobacco companies world wide consider him a go-to man in their time of need.  <br /> <br />\\"Thank You For Smoking\\" draws the curtain on American stupidity, revealing both sides of an argument that will never reach compromise. Taylor's job requires sometimes very dangerous work. He crosses paths with a number of characters in the media and political underworld, much like an assassin would in a gangster film. He is good friends with two very interesting people: Polly Bailey (Maria Bello), an alcoholic who is a lobyist for the alcohol industry, and Jay Bliss (David Koechner), a firearms industry spokesperson. Together, they call themselves The MOD (Merchants Of Death) Squad, meeting in a quiet restaurant for sandwiches and drinks on a regular basis, and discussing marketing their little club with t-shirts and bumper stickers.  <br /> <br />Nick has a son named Joey, played by Cameron Bright, who we saw three weeks ago capping his father and being kidnapped by murderous pedophiles in \\"Running Scared.\\" Here he is being homeschooled by his father, not just in academics, but in the tricks of his father's trade. Nick's boss is BR (J. K. Simmons), an aggressive hot-head who is determined to boost cigarette sales. Nick suggests the movies, in one of the film's most memorable sequences, so that tobacco can begin to appeal to all ages. He also suggests that all of the characters smoke, because, as he so cleverly observes, \\"these days when anybody smokes in the movies, they are either Europeans or psychopaths.\\"  <br /> <br />But wait, there's more. Nick even encounters Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes), a sexy journalist doing an investigaton for The Washington Probe. There is Jeff Megall (Rob Lowe), a corporate mongul who works as a vessel for Nick's ideas. There is Lorne Lutch (Sam Elliott), a former Marlboro Man who is dying of lung cancer and ready to speak out against the tobacco industry. There is also the Captain (Robert Duvall), a tobacco tycoon based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, who sees Nick as a revolutionary for Amercian society. And then there is the matter of Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy), who is quick to attack the tobacco industry from multiple directions but slow to realize that his homestate of Vermont, which produces cheddar cheese, is, in the context of his own arguement, a contributer to cholesterol, the leading cause of death in the United States, something that Nick is educated enough to point out by himself.  <br /> <br />\\"Thank You For Smoking\\" would be the result if Quentin Tarantino were to attempt a social and politcal satire. Since Nick is such an intelligent professional, and because he is able to knock down his enemies one at a time, subtly pinpointing the stupidity of their own argument, the film is wide open for humorous, quotable dialogue that only continues to resonate once it penetrates your eardrums. On the part of writer/director Jason Reitman, no praise is too high. Like Paul Haggis did in devising \\"Crash,\\" Reitman is able to juggle a number of very diverse characters and bring them to life with spirited animation. This is also one of the first satires I've seen in a while in which the humor is never of the goofy slapstick caliber, and seems to emerge so naturally from the material that you almost miss it once it emerges.  <br /> <br />What makes the film so effective is that Nick is an obnoxious jerk that you can't help but adore. He is played with quiet enthusiasm by Aaron Eckhart, an actor who goes shamefully unmentioned when movie snobs gather together to discuss their obsession. He is so effective, with his smirk grin, uplifting voice, and sprawling confidence, that you actually accept him as a lobbyist. Nick belongs there. He has the look and behind-the-scenes personality as a confident professional who takes pleasure in doing his job. Even in handling the character of Nick, the film never goes into the conventional atmosphere of the genre. Unlike in \\"Lord of War,\\" the hero never goes through a period in the third act in which he pays dearly for his sins. Nick makes out like a bandit.  <br /> <br />Jason Reitman has directed a number of short films, but with his first full length project, he has struck gold and set up a mine. The only way to prevent myself from digging into the deeper layers of the film is to end my review. Checking out his resume on imdb.com would lead you to believe that he would never find a niche for himself in the world of filmmaking. Well, he has.  <br /> <br />
0743486196|3.0|I started out really enjoying this book.  It was interesting, I wanted to get to know the characters and see what happens next.  But after a while, the book becomes an endeavor.  I have to read through pointless recollections of the characters to get to an ending that frankly made me want to chuck the book out the window.  If I hear \\"That reminds me of the time that...\\" or \\"I go back to the time that...\\" one more time I think I will collapse.   <br />However, I would still recommend this book mostly because of the concept and minus the recollections the writing is very good.

B0002Y4TM4|3.0|I am not a long time Marillion fan. I started listening to Marillion about a year ago, getting Script first, then Misplaced, Fugazi, and Clutching. I had read that most people feel Fish era Marillion is the best stuff. I have also read that neither Fish (solo) nor the current Marillion lineup have been able to come close to the 1980's Marillion material. <br /> <br />Despite this information, I decided to give Marbles a try. The first song is quite good. The rest of the album has it's moments. It is not terrible, but it is a bit repetitive. They are no longer what I would call \\"progressive rock\\" nor are they \\"neo progressive rock\\". They are simply a pop-rock band, maybe alternative in leaning -- comparable to U2 or Cold Play. They are nothing like IQ, who have remained one of the most amazing bands in the neo-progressive scene. <br /> <br />One problem I have with Marbles is that it jumps on the bandwagon of trite club-drum-machine beats. They are no longer a progressive rock band. Not like they need to have the Tony Banks (or Bach-style) keyboard solos or 25 minute epics. But this is just pop music. Drum beats you can dance to, and song structures that are more like soundscapes than the compositions that prog fans are fond of. You won't find diverse time signatures or abrupt changes. Everything is too smooth... it's slick. Really, Marbles is a great name for this album, since marbles are smooth and slick. <br /> <br />If you are into U2 and Coldplay, you may enjoy Marbles. I'll stick with IQ and Dream Theater... Maybe some day, Marillion will do some serious composing, and come up with work that is both progressive and original. This can be done. But listening to Marbles, I have no desire to listen to any more post-Fish Marillion albums. <br /> <br />It's a shame, because I know these guys are very talented. They can do way better than this repetitive alterna-club pablum. <br /> <br />Maybe they became tired with comparisons to Genesis, Yes, and Pink Floyd. But nowthey sound like U2, Cold Play, and Pink Floyd. Marillion have never been a very original band, but I could always appreciate the strength of Fish's lyrics, and the power with which he sang them. His lyrics were better than anything Gabriel or Collins have written. The lyrics were both real and visceral. They were about the suffering and triumph of regular people with real problems. Never silly or cute, like Genesis lyrics... Instead, they revealed truths about pain, pleasure, and the human psyche. Who can listen to Warm Wet Circles and At That Time of the Night and not be on the brink of weeping?!? <br /> <br />As far as Marillion are concerned, the Fish era material is the best. Neither Fish as a solo artist nor Marillion without Fish can compare. I don't think if Fish re-joined Marillion, it would matter either. Marillion haven't aged well, in my opinion. They have absorbed the lazy influences of contemporary music, and pushed away the strong work ethic of 70's prog. The \\"kickin'\\" drum loops are depressingly boring. Progressive rock has never been about loops or soundscapes, except maybe Krautrock or experimental stuff (like Richard Pinhas). But this isn't Krautrock or pioneering electronic artistry. This is the kind of music that you'd hear at Starbucks or something... <br /> <br />That said, it's not a terrible album on it's own. But when you compare it to the first four Marillion studio albums, it's not worth listening to. <br /> <br />If you want an album to relax to, Marbles (or any Enya album, for that matter) may be your cup of tea. This is not progressive rock. It's something to listen to in bed if you have insomnia...

B0009A1AS2|5.0|I'm very surprised with the lukewarm reception this DT album has received. This is by far one of their best works. I actually put off buying this one, because the reviews were not that great. I saw them live last weekend, and they played the full 24 minute Octavarium suite. Oh my! The next day I purchased the CD, and it's really one of the best DT albums ever. <br /> <br />I must say, I am not a fan of their soft rock balladry. In fact, at the live show, I sarcastically lit up my lighter every time they started with the metal ballads. To my chagrin, other people did this in a sincere manner. I love soft rock the way 70's Genesis did it. Dream Theater's soft rock gives me diarreah. Jame Labrie is an excellent singer, but when he does his vocal ballad stuff, it makes me want to vomit and purge my bowels simultaneously. That said, Dream Theater are one of my favorite bands. Seeing them live, I realize they keep the soft rock to a minimum, and play all of the best songs... It's not really a matter of opinion. It is very obvious which songs are strong, and which songs are pop diarreah... I really wish Dream Theater could write higher quality soft rock tunes, like Genesis, 80's Marillion, or IQ. DT's soft rock is so commercial sounding, it's a real turn off. I wouldn't be surprised if someone sang a DT ballad on American Idle... <br /> <br />The thing I love about Dream Theater is when they get wickedly complicated. If you like that, you will like Octavarium. They keep the soft rock to a minimum, and present some of the most nefarious and technically mind-blowing works to date. <br /> <br />The editiorial review mentions this being \\"lean\\". Did the reviewer manage to listen to the last 24 minute track? What's lean about that? The IQ/Genesis/Bach-esque keyboard solo on that one is played on a 20 foot tall modular synthesizer. What's \\"lean\\" about 2 stories of analog electronics patched together with wires? I don't get the notion that Petrucci or Rudess are \\"toning the solosdown\\". This is not true. This is some of the most impressive work by DT ever! <br /> <br />My favorite thing about Octavarium is what I suspect to be IQ influence. Yes, both bands are influenced by Genesis, and Tony Banks borrows a lot from classical music, particularly J.S. Bach. But there are some serious IQ-isms in the new Dream Theater. As amazing as the musicianship is in IQ, Dream Theater are even better. So they take some aspects of IQ's sound, and run with it -- no, fly with it... I applaud the direction they are moving in. I suspect that Portnoy is aware of the resurgence of progressive music (I've seen him at NEARfest), and it seems that Dream Theater are moving more in this direction. This is impressive, considering how \\"prog rock\\" they already were. <br /> <br />I'm really impressed with this work and the direction this band is heading. I can only hope they continue to filter out the mainstream and commercial aspects of their sound, and create new directions in progressive rock music. Perhaps this is why Octavarium isn't getting so many 5 star reviews -- this is a lot less commercial than previous DT releases.
B000301YY8|5.0|I first purchased and downloaded this album off of MusicMatch.  I burned it onto a CD and listened to it in my car on the way to work.  Oh my goodness!  I was blown away.  I don't even have a favorite song on the album because every song is so unique.  I loved the album so much, I went to the store and bought the CD (so I could have the original jewel case, disk , and lyrics insert).  I now have a copy for my room and for my car.  I listen to it on Repeat at least a few times before I change the CD out.  James Blunt's voice is so amazing... kinda like and angelic Rod Stewart lol.  I was impressed that he actually writes his own lyrics and music... It's just not that common anymore, which is sad.  I truly love this album and I got my friend hooked on it too.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|Disney's \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is one of their most underrated animated masterpieces that finally gets the 2 disc special edition treatment that it so very much deserves.  The animation is pleasing to the eyes, the songs are pleasing to the ears, and Alice's adventures are charming and interesting to behold.  The classic childhood story written my Lewis Carroll, is given a brilliant boost with great animated characters that bring Alice's adventures to glorious life.  Kathryn Beaumont give's Alice a voice that is so sincere with each amazing discovery in the Land of Wonder, so that the character seems more real than simply animated.  Kathryn also does a great job as the voice for Wendy in Disney's \\"Peter Pan.\\"  This dvd release is loaded with tons of extras that are very enjoyable to watch.  I especially like the Walt Disney tv special, starring Kathryn Beaumont and Bobby Driscoll (Treasure Island) that introduces \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" to the public and features excerpts from \\"Song of the South\\" and other Disney films.  I highly recommend \\"Alice in Wonderland : The Masterpiece Edition\\" to fans of classic Disney animated films and to fans of animated childhood stories and fantasies.  \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is a beautiful daydream that definitely should not be missed!

1400079276|4.0|This is my first time reading Japanese author Haruki Murakami - and it will definitely not be my last. Kafka on the Shore is quite enigmatic, and the story is such an origial tale with enormous seductive powers. The novel consists of two intertwining stories featuring 15-year old run-away student Kafka Tamura and retired feline-loving simpleton Nakata. They are both on a journey, but for different reasons. The coming-of-age story of Kafka is the perfect compliment to Nakata's \\"exit-of age\\". Don't worry about me giving away the ending - mostly because the author himself dosn't seem to be giving it away. Suffice it to say it is a modern Oedipus tale sauteed with plenty of surreal twists served over a steeming order of nail-biting suspense.<br /><br />I have recently read too many novels where there are lots of \\"mysteries\\" and overly constructed surprises only to have a conclusion where it is all nicely tied up and neatly explained - and you are supposed to be surprised as to how it all was really connected. It is becoming such a tired and quite predictable formula. This story, however, will not give you the answers like tomorrow's newspaper will give you the solved sudoku puzzle.<br /><br />In a certain way, Murakami reminds me a bit of Kundera (my all-time favorite author). The characters are compelling, the descriptions acute, yet elusive, the emotions raw and brutally honest, and the sense of mystery unapologetically lingers long after the story ends.<br /><br />As far as the translation is concerned, it did seem a bit \\"over-translated\\" at times. It seemed artifial to read about dollars instead of yen, and the colloquial expressions often seemed too American...However, I don't speak any Japanese, so I cannot be too critical - I can just offer my sense of the translated text.<br /><br />I cannot wait to read more from this Japanese Kundera...
0446677450|5.0|This book is an exceptional piece of writing on entrepreneurialism and the effects of the entitlement mentality.  The information age has been here for decades, but our society is experiencing a severe cultural lag.  Okay, so what do I mean by this statement?  The industrial age, yet the public education system and the entitlement mentality it created remains strongly entrenched in American culture.  It is as if we have built the car and did not pave roads or build traffic lights for the new technology. <br /> <br />Read this book to obtain a better understanding of to change your habits and your children's habits to prepare for this new era that we are in. <br /> <br />You do not need to go out and quit your job and start a business to succeed, but Americans and citizens of other first world countries must adapt and learn to take care of themselves.  If you are under 50, you have an excellent chance of never receiving social security and if you are under 40, you can forget about ever collecting a pension that you will be able to live off. <br /> <br />WARNING: <br />Please do not read this book and then immediately go out and buy a rental home with a 2K/mo mortgage that you can only rent out for $800.00/mo.  I know a lot of people that did this and were extremely sorry.  Robert is very clear that losing money monthly on an investment doesn't make sense.

B000E5N62U|5.0|Production is as hi-q as any Donald Fagen production.  It has a very mellow overall feel with lots of groove tracks plus imaginative progressions and vocal harmonies.  The solo work is all par excellance. The lyrics while ranging into the contextually bizarre are well-laced with the ambiance and imagery of Fagen's (obviously) favorite town; New York City. <br />Overall, the work misses the memorable (easy) \\"pop-hooks\\" in the melody line that have pushed many of his compositions over the top into that \\"mass-hit\\" category.  There are some simpler pop elements to be found in the bluesy WHAT I DO that is almost ballad-like in it's smooth feel.  For any self-respecting pop to jazz musician (or above-the-norm aficionado) however, this recording is another Donald Fagen MUST. <br />I have always thought that Fagen is as much a lyricist as a musical composer (if we can break up and look in upon the creative process). He has done us the major favor of giving us an introduction in the liner notes for each of his songs in tangible language so that we can share where he's coming from.  In the past, I have felt that these editings were just a bit too scant to really let the listener in on the joke or terror to which he was referring in his lyrics.  In this latest work, he has opened the window wide to let us peer inside. <br />Personally, this recording is a definite A+. <br />I could go on in detail but I will stop here; the rest is in your own experience...or not. <br />psm

0307276902|2.0|I read this book when it was first published, primarily because I knew the author had been to treatment at Hazelden. I went through inpatient treatment at Hazelden in 1996 and will have ten years of sobriety this May. Perhaps I was curious to compare his experience to mine--thought he might mention somebody I'd met there, been on the same unit, maybe just to feel a connection with somebody who'd actually written a book and had it published. Regardless, I read the book and was immediately taken aback by the disparity between Jame's Frey's alledgedly factual account of inpatient treatment and my own experience. Without grinding out all the specific details, many of the events this author describes as taking place during his inpatient stay at Hazelden (with what appears to be the tacit approval of staff) seemed highly unlikely. For example, Hazelden has a rigidly enforced policy of non-fraternization between male and female clients. I am not so naive as to think this policy is not subject to violation, but when a man on my treatment unit began communicating with a woman he had met during detox, he was confronted by his peers, the issue was brought to the attention of the unit counselors, and he was discharged from treatment when he continued to pursue the relationship. At least that's how it worked when I was there. And the bit about the dental work. Maybe that's how they performed oral surgery two hundred years ago but let's get real. Nerve blocks with local anesthetics, nitrous, non-narcotic analgesics--there are plenty of ways to provide a patient with pain management without having to give an addict opioids. <br /> <br />I was surprised when I learned the book had been selected for Oprah's Book Club, as I  assumed (incorrectly) that a book of this nature would have undergone some form of editorial vetting process to verify its authenticity prior to being recommended to millions of readers. While Mr. Frey's depiction of the peer-driven therapeautic milieu incorporated into Hazelden's treatment model resonated with my own experience, there were too many inconsistencies which led me to doubt the veracity of the author's story. Obviously, subsequent events have born out those suspicions. <br /> <br />But what disturbed me more than Mr. Frey's taking liberty with the facts (and apparently creating others from whole cloth) was the overall tenor of his nascent recovery. His resistent attitude towards his treatment goals and what has become known as the \\"Minnesota Model\\" of recovery (which incorporates the 12-steps of AA) permeates the book. His actions at the end of the book (sticking his nose in a tumbler of whiskey to demonstrate his victory over the \\"Fury\\") are indicative of a man determined to \\"do it on his own\\" and ignore every scintilla of advice received from his counselors and peers during treatment. When I left treatment I was advised to abstain from all mood-altering substances, go to AA, and stay away from slippery places and slippery people. I did what I was told and so far it's working (and I pray it works again today). The last thing I would have done was put my sobriety to the test by staring down a drink. <br /> <br />I'm not trying to beat the drum for AA. I realize there are plenty of folks who find recovery through other means (I am currently employed as an addiction counselor). But AA is what has worked for me and, in my experience, it is the most successful recovery program out there. Bill W. says in the Big Book \\"the alcoholic [or addict] is an extreme example of self-will run riot\\" and Mr. Frey seems to embody that definition. A core tenet of AA is \\"rigorous honesty\\"--\\"Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and woman who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves.\\" Mr. Frey appears to have some work left to do in this area also.  <br /> <br />I hope readers of this book will be captivated by the author's raw,visceral portrayal of the horror of addiction and the benefits to be derived from sharing those experiences with others suffering from the same disease. However, I hope they do not let his story serve as an illustration of an addict moving into a healthy recovery. From a therapist's perspective, much of this story is like a \\"How Not To\\" book of recovery. There are a lot of good books out there dealing with addiction (\\"Drinking: A Love Story\\" by Caroline Knapp; Cool Water: Alcoholism, Mindfulness, and Ordinary Recovery by William Alexander; or, God forbid, the \\"big book\\" of Alcoholics Anonymous--these are just a taste). Don't let this book be your sole exposure to treatment and recovery. And stop in at an open meeting of AA to meet and listen to some \\"real life\\" miracles!
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|Thanks to the reviews of previous versions, I waited for this offical release of McLintock and it was worth it. The disc has a crisp clear picture and very good audio. A great Duke film and now presented in the way it was meant to be.
B000E6UK32|2.0|I was so excited when I found out about this album/dvd! Unfortunately I was expecting something like the David Bowie Best Of dvd. Now that is a collection! Why can't the record companies give the fans the complete picture? There are so many ommissions on this dvd it's mind boggling. Blondie deserves a double dvd collection with live performances, alternate videos, interviews, proper liner notes. Who wouldn't want to see when Debbie Harry was featured on the Muppet Show! That would be an amazing bonus. I am still holding out for a proper dvd release because this one doesnt cut it for me. After all this is the band that was JUST inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame! Give Blondie the kudos they deserve and take a note from the David Bowie Best Of dvd---thats the sort of package the fans want and deserve. As well its the only fitting tribute to one of the premier women of punk/new wave in a world of plastic phonies like Britney Spears, Hillary Duff and Ashley Simpson! Anyone agree??
0439321603|5.0|The one problem with this fabulous little book is that many of the creatures are difficult to envision without an illustration, of which there are very few (and when there are, they are merely black and white sketches.) It can be quite hard to tell if you're picturing the animal correctly. Fortunately for me, my favorite of the beasts is illustrated. This book definitely convinced me to get myself some Fwoopers--birds of African origin with vivid orange, yellow, green or pink plumage.
B00005JNX0|5.0|We totally enjoyed this movie. It was funny, and very entertaining for both adult and children.
B000063DIR|1.0|Dont get me wrong, Diary of a Madman is probably one of the bands best albums, but this re-release is to be thrown away.  They completely re-recorded the bass and drum tracks with the current Ozzy members, so that they wouldnt have to pay the original band members royalties, even though they were some of the ones that wrote and arranged songs with Randy, Ozzy usually has nothing to do with the music, and quite often doesnt even write lyrics.  <br /> <br />I will never purchase another Ozzy album again, do yourself a favor and try to find the original recording of this album on ebay or something. Do not give a single penny to these greedy people.
B000002MFN|4.0|I like the bedroom lounge atmosphere of this record.  The only thing that would make it perfect would be to have added 'Justify My Love' at the end.  Similar in tone to Bedroom Stories, I also liked the playfulness here as well as on her new CD.
B000068R1X|2.0|if you like Jake E Lee's playing, then you might as well grab this album, otherwise, its a throw-away release with one or two standout tracks

B00006M183|2.0|Everytime a new Pearl Jam cd comes out I buy it, why?  I think because in the early '90s they stood for so much.  I wanted to like each cd, but disappointment is what I receive. So when someone stole this cd from me I have never missed it nor wanted to replace it.  Hopefully thier new cd will rock but I will have to be sold on it before I buy it.   <br />       No one can deny what a great cd Ten was, and I didn't want each cd to sound like it, I just wanted more of the feeling but each release was flat.  I know their is legion of fans but you know exactly what I am talking about. <br />       I give this two stars because with each Pearl Jam cd their is one or two tracks that are good.   Just have to fumble through all the cr4p on them, and for me I am just sick of it.

0446677450|2.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki is an easy read about his (real, exaggerated, or fictional) financial experiences and lessons. Whether these stories are true or not, they are indeed poignant and memorable. The book is an aggressive yet honest talk abut financial choices and responsibility. (Note that I didn't say financial practices.) <br /> <br />You will probably find this book under \\"personal finance,\\" but it's better filed under \\"self-improvement.\\" The book doesn't give specific advise on or explain financial planning, such as \\"The Wall Street Journal's Lifetime Guide to Money\\" (addressing relevant concerns however outdated now), instead \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" is a series of stories from his childhood and this-is-what-I-did-to-get-rich to make readers itching about their financial situation.  <br /> <br />If you want to feel like you should be doing something, then this is a good book for you. (Actually even for that, I would suggest \\"A Whack on the Side of the Head.\\") But, if you want to understand the language of financial planning, try another book or online government resource ([...]
B0000DD7LB|5.0|1. Me Against The Music - The first single off the album. A good fast paced dance/R&B/Rap track. Britney collaborates herself with Madonna. Britney shows that she can rap in this (and really good too) 11/10 <br /> <br />2. (I Got That) Boom Boom - A hip hop track featuring the Ying Yang Twins. Awesome song! Should have been a single! It would have done wonders for Ms Spears. 12/10 <br /> <br />3. Showdown - Another dance/urban track. Nice work here. Its got a sexy chorus making you want more. 9/10 <br /> <br />4. Breathe On Me - Very sexy! Awesome song! Its really mysterious and the chorus is full of sexy-ness and style! It's a great song. It will leave you breathe-less. 12/10 <br /> <br />5. Early Mornin - Moby wrote this one. And you can tell with the start. It's a techno type start with a R&B sounding chorus and back to a techno type verse. Another good song. 11/10 <br /> <br />6. Toxic - The second single off the album, and it was a smash hit too. Sexy and stylish and I am sure that everyone out there has heard this one. 12/10 <br /> <br />7. Outrageous - Was suppose to be released as a single. You can see a preview of the clip on her DVD \\"Greatest Hits\\" My Prerogative\\" featuring Snoop Dogg. It's a pounding hip hop song, its got a clever South African-ish feel to it, and it features R Kelly. 12/10 <br /> <br />8. Touch Of My Hand - A lot of Britney fans like the song, but I don't see a point to it. It's a sexy song but  its missing something that the other tracks have. 8/10 <br /> <br />9. The Hook Up - Great song! The beat is fantastic! Great song to dance to. It's a bit R&B mixed with Dance. Sounds like something Rihanna would sing. 11/10 <br /> <br />10. Shadow - A dark track. It's a ballad but its very dark and mysterious. The chorus is catchy \\"its only your shadow\\" Britney repeats. I would have chosen this one over Everytime as a single. 10/10 <br /> <br />11. Brave New Girl - The only \\"fault\\" in the album. It doesn't belong here. It's a upbeat pop song that the \\"old\\" Britney fans would appreciate. And I was never a fan of the old Britney. 5/10 <br /> <br />12. Everytime - A ballad with beautiful lyrics. With nothing but a piano and violins this one is simple but at the same time its beautiful. It didn't do that well on the charts though. It was the third song to be released. 9/10 <br /> <br />*13. Me Against The Music (remix) - This was a bonus track, it's a great one to dance to. Its got that latin feel to it. 9/10 <br /> <br />*14. The Answer - Nothing special here. This was another bonus track. Reminds me of Touch Of My Hand a lot. 8/10 <br /> <br />*15. Don't Hang Up -  Bonus Track. AWESOME song! Should have been included as an original track! It's like an up-tempo ballad. Its got style to it and the chorus is amazing! 12/10 <br /> <br />In The Zone proves to be an instant classic! This album is full of R&B and Hip Hop and Dance, which is a good direction for Ms Spears. She should stick to these genres. <br />Cant wait to see what her comeback will be like. <br />Oh and by the way, if you were a fan of the OLD Britney material then dont be surprised if you dont like this one... she made this cd to get the attention of more mature audiences. <br /> <br />      <br />
B000286RKW|5.0|Good Fellas is one of the greatest mob movies of all time, directed by one of the greatest directors, and starring some of the most talented actors of all time.  How could you not respect a masterpiece of this calaber?  <br /> <br />Good Fellas is the story of Henry Hill, the most famous turncoat in Mafia history.  At the tender age of 13 as a smartass kid in New York, he becomes an errand boy for his local mob club, to climb the ladder to spend 30 years on the inside.  His jealousy is obvious, as he, like Jimmy \\"The Gent\\" cannot be officially made because they have Irish blood.  But he copes and learns to never rat on his friends and keep his mouth shut.  Henry becomes greedy, as he delves deeper into cocaine addiction, lying to and cheating the very people who taught him everything he knew.  When he has hit rock bottem and realizes that his colleges are going to turn him in, Henry turns state's evidence and turns them all in.  He would spend the next few years in the Witness Protection Program, but emerged after seven years to become a pseudo celebrity.  He even has his own website now. <br /> <br />What appeals to us so much about a movie about the Mafia is that there is no struggle against good and evil, it's all evil.  None of these people (save for the police) are the \\"good guys\\", and none of them are really \\"good fellas\\".  They spend their lives skirting the law, contributing to America's drug problem, and profiting off of otherwise honest people.  And yet they live like kings.  Snap your fingers and you have everything: money, women, power, prestige, material things, etc.  And at the end, Henry says the worst part is having to live like an ordinary shnook.  He shows no remorse for what he's done.  But then again, if we had that kind of life, would we?
B00004T0UT|5.0|I really enoyed the cd i play it over and over again.I was not awaer that this cd was released until i went to amazon and found it.Thank You amazon for caring hard to find produts.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|This movie took a great idea and completely eff'ed it up. While amusing at times, this movie just doesn't cut it. Heath Ledger was amusing enough to make me stay, but otherwise, this is one ugly duckling.
B000BKVQTS|4.0|My daughters and I watched this film together and found it most entertaining. It has a great mix of different fairy tales, comedy and horror which we all enjoyed. It also has Heath Ledger who is very cute! Would recommend it for older children (mine are 12 and 15) as younger ones would find some scenes too scary.
B000063DFN|5.0|Iron Maiden officially conquered the heavy metal world with the \\"Powerslave\\" album and the amazing tour the followed it's release.  This album marks the point in time where Iron Maiden went from being just another great metal band to becoming the true masters of their craft. <br /> <br />The album starts with \\"Aces High\\".  This song demands the listener's total attention.  Dave and Adrian play amazingly fast guitar riffs in complete synchronization with one another backed up by Nicko's powerful, yet controlled drum beats and Steve Harris' amazing bass ability.  Then the listener is treated to the wide range of Bruce DIckinson's vocals(I've always felt this is one of his best tunes).   <br /> <br />After you wipe the sweat from your forehead, \\"Two Minutes To Midnight\\" begins.  This is a staple at any Maiden concert because it demands audience sing-along(as many Maiden songs do).   <br /> <br />\\"Losfer Words\\" is an instrumental piece and is quite enjoyable.  I wish Maiden continued doing these(they haven't released an instrumental piece since this song) and while it's not quite \\"Transylvania\\" it is an impressive track and fits in with the mood of this album. <br /> <br />I'll jump ahead to \\"Powerslave\\", which is an epic 8 minute song that makes the listener truly feel the pain of slavery, through both the guitar progressions and lyrics.   <br /> <br />The CD ends with what I feel to be Maiden's best song and truly a remarkable song-writing accomplishment, \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\".  Based on Samual Coolidge's poem of the same name, this epic 13 minute sage dictates the poem as interpreted and re-written by Steve Harris.  This song marks the height of Maiden's song-writing and performing and is an unbelievably amazing track.  There are around 7 \\"changes\\" to the song and the mood changes to fit the story so well, that it feels almost as if you are watching a movie and not just listening to a song.  There is a 2-3 minute \\"breakdown\\" in which we listen to a narrator tell the story, followed by the best lead-in to a chorus imaginable.  This is, without question, my favorite song of all time.   <br /> <br />So, all in all, this CD is well worth any money invested in it.  North America needs to give Iron Maiden a chance, for they are missing the best and most talented metal band in history.  This is their best CD and deserves a chance to become part of every music lovers collection.(The best part about this CD is that Maiden actually plays these songs so good live, that you would think you are listening to a studio cut.) <br /> <br />UP THE IRONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JOE8|5.0|I've just seen this on the big screen - its just opened here in the  UK (would have made more sense to open on November 5th , but distributors missed a trick on that one, perhaps thats the date for the DVD).  <br /> <br />I have never read the Graphic Novel but i am very impressed by the updating of the story to fit the War-on-Terror world. I found all the performances solid and good to see NP given something a bit more meaty to do. She is good but she has quite a distinctive accent, which would be unnoticable were we not so familar with it from Star Wars. <br /> <br />This asks big questions about violence as protest - even though V is mostly driven by revenge made more justifiable by the repugent nature of the government. I take the view 2 wrongs dont make a right , but the strength of this film is as we, like Evoy, have to make a judgement on the moral ambivilence of V. <br /> <br />Its a much more mature and rewarding work than the tiresomly violent and increasingly cartoonish Matrix films - here violence has a moral context (even though it is strangely enjoyable to have Stephen Fry being beaten up during the film......... ). <br /> <br />Oh and in response to the previous correspondant , America is only mentioned once, and thats just to explain its non-involvement in the story (civil war no less!) so i dont see the Anti-American bit. Perhaps its the shock of a non Yanko-centric movie might be a bit hard to cope with as i guess they're not used to that.....  <br /> <br />All in all - a thought provoking piece of work about Freedom of Speech and how far we should go to preserve it, which never becomes po-faced. Full marks. <br />  <br />Roll on the DVD.
B00000HZTB|5.0|The Blue Mask is undoubtedly one of Lou Reed's finest albums and one of his most raw, angry, and personal song collections. I love all of Lou's music, and soon after The Blue Mask, his songs began to evolve into more allegorical tales with broader intonation and composition. The Blue Mask is the last Lou Reed album with a large collection of the hard edged, riff driven rock songs. This is combined with incredibly personal lyrics that are confessional, shocking, and provocative. <br /> <br />The title cut is a sonic triumph focused on sadomasochistic themes, \\"Take the blue mask down from my face and stick me in the eye. I get a thrill from punishment, I've always been that way.\\" Other highly personal compositions also work well both musically and lyrically. Underneath the Bottle is a song documenting the trials and consequences of alcholol abuse (Lou sings, \\"I've got bruises on my legs from I can't remember when...\\"). Waves of Fear is another hard riffing song that captures paranoid stress and confusion. It evokes a midnight breakdown after ingesting too much and too many things. The sinister \\"The Gun\\" brings us into the mind of a gun toting criminal: \\"The man has a gun and he knows how to use it. 6mm Browning, let's see what he can do.\\" The song goes on to tell us just what the man is up to. <br /> <br />Now if all these sound morbid and challenging, well, they are. But the Blue Mask is much more. These songs are juxtaposed with compositions that express incredible passion and empathy. My favorite of these is \\"The Day John Kennedy Died,\\" which showcases Lou as a highly reflective and socially engaged songwriter. <br /> <br />The Blue Mask is certainly a challenging and thought provoking album that is not easily forgotten once heard. If you want to go beyond the popular Lou Reed songs and his most recent more accessible work, this album is for you. Be prepared and enjoy!

0307276902|5.0|I'm a normal college student living the normal college life with lots of drugs and alcohol readily available and an occasional good book to pass the time between exams.  A friend of mine told me to read this, and try to look past all the Oprah crap so I did. <br />This was written just like I think.  Maybe that's a bad thing, but the words ran together and there was no structure in the sentences and it was PERFECT.  I don't know what it's like to go through rehab, and I don't know if he knows what it's like because from what I hear, he is a great liar.  But at this point, it doesn't matter.   <br />He has a way of demanding that people take responsibility or their actions and in order to become a better human being, stand up and choose to do so.  I had a psych professor tell me one time that Life is about Choices and Choices have Consequences.  I agree, and in saying that, I am proud of James Frey. <br />He chose to embellish the truth and the consequence of doing so was that thousands of people were saved from themselves and their bad habits.  I can't really say it changed my life, but it added prospective.  <br /> <br />I LOVED IT!!!
B000005Z0G|4.0|This album was VERY underappreciated for a variety of political reasons. <br /> <br />TuPac was many things to many people ... loaded with contradictions, like this album that ranges from the inspirational high of \\"Keep Ya Head Up\\" to the G'ed Up \\"I Get Around.\\" <br /> <br />But isn't life also a contradiction?  (Yes) And doesn't the best art imitate life? (Supposedly, yes) <br /> <br />If you've just gotta have a TuPac album to really understand his poetry and what made him standout from so many rappers, cop either this LP or preferably, TuPac's 1991 debut \\"2Pacalypse Now.\\" <br /> <br />Those albums are literally being studied in college classrooms (deservingly and appropriately so!) as I write this review.
B000000WCA|5.0|WOW! The best band ever, with 6 from 10 songs in 1 place in world top charts! The Spice Girls, a MUST HAVE CD in you collection!
0375831002|5.0|Very rarely a book comes out that steals my breath away. The Book Thief, by Markus Zusak is a revelation. Narrated by Death, this story follows Leisel as she steals books in Nazi Germany while she and her best friend Rudy discover the power of words, language and friendship. Zusak's writing is mesmerizing; it's sarcastic, emotional, sophisticated and wondrous.  <br /> <br />If you only read one book this year, read this one. Share it with your friends and family.  I don't expect to read anything better this year, or next year either.
B000007492|5.0|Nice collection of great songs. The remastering on this CD is superb! Just put on a decent set of headphones and listen. You will not be disappointed. A \\"must have\\" CD IMO.
0679422714|1.0|The book is garbage of the worst type.  No serious attempt is made to study demographic data in a way which would support the outlandish assertions here.  A more relevant book for someone to read would be Judith Banister's CHINA'S CHANGING POPULATION.  Banister's book was the first serious demographic study of China and it remains an essential must for anyone interested in wading through the dry facts.  A point of comparison that is essential here has to do with the question of the 1960 famine, which this book assigns way over the top numbers to.  Banister herself was also a bit careless since in the text she casually attributes 30 million deaths to this famine.  What becomes clear when you actually look at the year-by-year population and mortality estimates is that there's a big issue at hand here in our choice of standard for the expected normal mortality rates.  Mortality in China dropped by more than 50% between the years 1949 and 1957.  There was a slight rise in mortality for the year 1958, over 1957 but still well under 1949.  Another slight rise in 1959, and then a real famine in 1960 with the mortality dropping back down again in 1961 to just slightly above the 1957 level.  Now of course you're going to compute very different famine death tolls depending upon whether you use 1949 or 1957 as the base year.  I computed a famine death count of 4.35 million by the 1949 standard and of 25.4 million by the 1957 base.  Banister was herself careless in rounding the 25.4 up to 30 without telling the reader that she was specifically using 1957 as her base standard.  But at least Banister provided the actual data for the reader to review and study.  This book does no such thing but just throws out stories which are worth about as much as an Iraqi WMD set to go off on 45 minutes notice.  By the way, a famine with 4.35 million dead against the 1949 standard of expected mortality was nothing unusual in the old China.  See Walter Mallory's classic of 1926, CHINA: LAND OFFAMINE if you wish to know more about the real background of famine in China.  The demographic reality is that mortality rates in China improved in an amazing way because of the revolution and have only suffered some relapses since 1978 as a result of the restoration of capitalism.
B00000JTB2|4.0|It is clear that these 2 men liked each other and enjoyed trading solos. However,it is also  much more of an Albert King showcase, with standout performances of Ask Me No Questions, Don't Lie To Me , and Stormy Monday. What I like most about it is that it sounds so much better (i.e. dynamic and modern) than most of the old Albert King albums. This album really captures the  high energy and power of a remarkable singer and guitarist(Albert King), and you can  hear the musical roots of where Steve Ray's sound came from. It was misleading to list 11 cuts on the album , since 4 are simply fragments of conversation between the 2 guitar heroes. However the songs are lenghty, for example, Blues At Sunrise runs over 15 minutes,and  those conversations add to the overall feel of a live concert , even though it is a studio recording., The  once in a lifetime combination of these 2 icons on the same album make this a real collector's item for blues fans
0452282152|5.0|Wow, what a beautiful book. Witty, vivid and engaging...and I guess a bit mysterious in a way...I loved it! A wonderful look at life in 17th century Holland. Highly recommended.
B000AL730Y|2.0|Well lets face it, Sir Paul McCartney is good at what he does, I mean he was part of the group that gave birth to what everybody now does, with of course, a few exceptions. Paul is a fine musician, songwriter, composer, and sound engineer. BUT; He is a lot older now and his voice is certainly not what it once was, although it is still better than most. It appears to me he is writing and recording this album (CD) Okay I'm old too! for posterity. He is already  in the history books with the Beatles acclaim, so why not put his mark on something of his own that will stand the test of time, and even cross over into several genre's. Will it satisfy Beatle fanatics? NO! Other than the fact that he WAS a Beatle and can't help but bring some of that sound to the table. BUT; this is Paul being Paul. If you like Paul and his taste of music you will love this. If you wane for more Beatle stuff you will be a little disappointed. BTW the Beatle stuff is done enjoy the legacy that was left and move on.
0156027321|4.0|I'd heard a lot about this book from friends, so I decided to give it a try. Initially, I didn't get what the fuss was about, but the more I read on, the more I got into the story...And right at the end is when I fell in love with the genius of it. I definetly recommend it.
0743201140|5.0|Used this book in my graduate school class at California State University East Bay.  While not overly scholarly, this book reads well and was very useful to my classmates and I.  We liked the focus on using strengths rather than weaknesses in developing an effective and efficient workforce.  Motivating your employees by emphasizing their strenths rather than weaknessness was a useful plus.  All in all, Buckingham and Clifton's book inspired my classmates and I to be better health care administrators.
B000001EL3|5.0|Even with the top 40 hit 'Beth' this album still marks the heavy rock high water mark of the band.  1977 was the year when the make-up and music came together.<br /><br />If you're going to buy a studio album by these guys make it this one.  Then pick up 'Hotter than Hell'.  If you still need more from the studio I'd recommend 'Rock and Roll Over' - this is the follow up to Destroyer and they were still riding high with quality songs.<br /><br />If you want something live then grab 'Kiss Alive (vol 1)'.  then you should just stop.  Sadly, there is no more magic to be found.
B000002UA9|5.0|My daughters and I very much enjoy this CD. We have every Beatle CD made, and this one brings us back to the voices of the early Beatles and how they sounded before Sgt Pepper and after. I love John's young voice singing \\"Anna\\" and \\"Misery\\"--I haven't heard these songs since I was 14. <br />JLF
B00000255F|5.0|Springsteen's epic Born to Run needed nothing more than to be cleanly put onto cd (which is done here nicely).  So you don't need to spend the extra money on that new package unless you just like spending more money or you are a completist.<br /><br />There is nothing to say here that has not been said countless times in other reviews.  You'll want to buy this cd and listen to it when you have the opportunity to hear it all in one sitting.<br /><br />Beyond the rating system.
B00005JO9J|5.0|one of the best show being aired in brazil, i couldn't wait for the brazilian release and i have no complains
0393327655|5.0|Extremely easy read and no need for a dictionary, as some would suggest in their review.  The book opens up as a critique of all religions, but most of the book is a harsh look at the Islamic thought and the Koran. <br />It is an easy read, and also a must read for any one interested in the `what is going on' and `why are we here' style questions. <br /> <br />Very logical, very straightforward and easy <br />
B00008DDSC|4.0|I couldn't take my eye's off this film.  James Spader is incredibly sexy and I just love Maggie Gyllenhall's determination to \\"get her man\\"!!  It was like a train wreck, you just can't look away.  Great sick twisted movie you must see!
B000E6UK5K|4.0|On An Island is a solid effort by Gilmour.  I love the intro track and the perfect lead into \\"On An Island\\".  The track On An Island could be on virtually any Floyd disc.  I think the song is as good as anything on Momentary Lapse Of Reason or Division Bell.  It has the sickest guitar solo(that lasts for about 2 1/2-3 minutes) that I've heard him play in a long time.  It definitely has that Floyd sound.  He does experiment w/other styles but doesn't stray too much from the Floyd led by Gilmour.  Overall it does not have that \\"it\\" factor like previous Floyd albums.  But is it worth buying if you're a Pink Floyd fan?  Yes....definitely yes.  The man's guitar playing on this album, and, the fact that he's a primary member of one of the top 5 rock n' bands of all-time should convice you to pick it up.  Now can we finally get a Pink Floyd reunion with Waters and Gilmour?  That's what we all want to see and hear.
B00004Z459|5.0|An incredible album. I can't get enough of it. Great car music! This is one of those albums where pretty well all the cuts are excellent, though I have to day I like In The End best of all.
B000003TAW|4.0|Probably their best cd.  I'd say its more odd and 'geeky' than the green album.  If you like slightly more poppy or mainstream music the green album might suit you better.  But I remember the first time I saw the Buddy Holly video, and thought it was so awesome, yet geeky so my pick is the Blue album. <br />
B000068FY0|5.0|From beginning to end this album is just fantastic. Much as a I like Breakfast in America, this is far superior.
0140277447|5.0|Never in my wildest imagine would I have expected this book to be so gripping.  I couldn't put it down!!  If you've never know the realities of WWII when it comes to atrocities against another group of human beings then I certainly suggest you read this book.  It will open your eyes, and make you cringe.
0440217563|5.0|Bravo X 3! So far I have read 3 and am reading the 4th book in the saga created by Diana Gabaldon. Her historical reasearch is so accurate, it should be taught as history in our schools; certainly I would have enjoyed history a lot more when I was in school if this type of book had been required reading. Her characters are real and one readily identifies with them as well as their thoughts and feelings. I feel as if I am living the history right along with Jamie and Claire and their descendants! Wonderful reading!
B0000CABBW|4.0|This was  a beautiful film, well-done.  It was interesting in that it was set in New Zealand in a culture that I knew nothing about. The characters were engaging and it was interesting to see the relationships grow. The effect of the grandfather on the grandaughter's life because of his hard and fast interpretation of tribal standards made for an interesting story. I would highly recommend it for your viewing.
B0002X314C|5.0|This album is just amazing!  John Legend is a part of an elite group of artists who actually believe in music.  This album keeps you wanting more. He makes you smile while you groove!!  John Legend is awesome!!
B000001GXI|4.0|don't be swayed by other, bitter reviews of this recording -- there is some serious hating going down in them. this is a beautiful production featuring one of the best conductors and some of the finest operatic voices of the 20th century. roberta peters' characterization of the queen of the night is entrancing, noble, dramatic, and -- even more importantly -- one of the few that actually dimensionalizes the queen's rage, hurt, frustrations, and sorrow!!!! there's definitely a reason (more than just the reliability of her high Fs -- as callas said, the Fs alone are not enough) why peters gave more than a bazillion performances of this role at the metropolitan... just like there's a reason that the met is currently saluting evelyn lear (pamina).... so maybe all the haters just need to get off their butts and go sing 'flute' themselves, if they really think there is so much lacking in this version.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I think the title explains it all.  I love this show!
B0002OERI0|1.0|I actually saw Green Day quite a few times at Gilman in Berkeley BEFORE they got signed to a major....and you know what? I thought they were boring. They were nothing more than surburban kids(no, they are not originally from Berkeley)trying to play punk music. I say 'trying' because nobody back in the day thought that they were punk. They were also very stuck up which did not endear them to many people. I have fond memories of the times in which I wrote 'Green Day Sucks!' all over the walls of Gilman.  <br /> <br />Despite the fact that a lot of people didn't personally like them quite a few of us thought that they would get 'big'. The reason being was that their music was safe sounding and wouldn't scare people off. Listen to Let's Start A War by The Exploited and then listen to this album. Hear the difference? One album is political,fast, and full of genuine rage, while the other is safe enough to get regular rotation on MTV and mainstream radio. <br /> <br />I would like, for a moment, to address their change of appearance that went along with this album being released. Were they getting so predictable and boring that they thought wearing eyeliner would help their album sales? Why...of course!! How 'punk rock' is it to change your appearance to generate record sales? It isn't.  <br /> <br />I have heard a few songs off of this album and in no way shape or form do I hear punk music. All I hear is pop music, safe and pre-packaged just like their 'new' image. This album is no different from the masses of other radio friendly 'pop-punk' albums being put out these days. <br /> <br />This isn't punk kids. You have all been conned and Green Day is enjoying spending your parents hard earned cash.
B000BKJ78K|5.0|The movies are great compared to VHS.  My family has really enjoyed them a great deal, with all the deleted scenes added it is almost like watching them for the first time.  I would highly recommend them to anyone.
B000BNI90O|5.0|I'm a musician, which means I'm pretty good at separating what is good and what is kitch, in terms of music. I've just finished listening to the DVD-Audio version of this soundtrack, and I am absolutely blown away. Firstly, for all the learned researchers out there who continue to muse about whether or not the human ear can actually hear the difference between the enhanced DVD-audio sound and CD-quality sound, I would like to say that yes, there is a difference, and yes, it can be heard. It can be heard in the same way that a good listener can hear the difference between the warmth of a vinyl album and the early sound of the original analogue-to-digital transfers that went into the first commercial CD's. I would ask you to do the following, if you are skeptical: place the DVD-audio version of this soundtrack in your computer (which is the only thing I have a 5.1 set of speakers attached to) and crank up the volume. If the hair on the back of your neck isn't on end after you've made it through the first few minutes of prologue, then you are dead. <br /> <br />As for the music itself, I've never bought a soundtrack album in my life, previous to this. Most soundtracks are crap. This one is absolutely remarkable, even for the slight flaws that have crept into the production. Firstly, I don't actually agree all that much with the one reviewer who finds Ian McKellan singing near the beginning to be disconcerting. I DID find the sudden break between two pretty ominous passages, in order to hear hobbits singing, slightly jarring, but of course this IS a soundtrack following the movie narration, and it DOES actually make sense to create a small break between two heavy sections with a lighter passage. Secondly, there are spots when the DVD moves from one track to another where the audio \\"dies\\" and then returns as the music moves from track to track. And yeah, that's annoying after one has gotten immersed in the music and suddenly is confronted with the reality that this really is a facsimile of a musical performance, and not the performance itself. Otherwise, though, the sound quality here is extraordinary. I've heard the terms \\"pompous\\" and \\"bombastic\\" used to describe Shore's music, but this isn't really fair. The movies themselves are really just a modern interpretation of the Nibelungenlied and a few other Northern European sagas mixed in for good measure, so it makes perfect sense for the soundtrack to have a Wagnerian atmosphere to it. Well, I highly recommend this soundtrack.
B00005JLD4|5.0|This is a great movie that will  open your eyes to past injustice yes, but also the determination of a people of strong heart. If you like true stories that stir your emotions, see this film.
B00005JO9J|5.0|If you're a fan of this program this is a what you're looking for.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never watched Firefly during its short TV run, but after watching the movie I got the bug for the series and lo and behold, Firefly is/was flat out good!  The comaraderie is there, the Whedon witty reparte, and timing, are carried over from Buffy and (especially) Angel, and I am left wishing for more.  The DVDs give me a chance to watch them as they should have been broadcast (makes much more sense by the way) and I again marvel that the guys making broadcast decisions at the networks can make it to work with their pants on.  In one word -- MORONS - thats right cancel Firefly but make sure you leave Elimidate on, don't want to lose that trailer park, sometimes sober, always in-bred segment of the audience!
6305212112|5.0|I liked everything about this movie, the story, the actors, and the overall production. A must-have for any collector
0316172324|3.0|The author makes a very good case on the ecology of the mind. The various situations in which a selective set of data is applied as alternate strategy to enable adequate response for survival are analyzed. However, the style is sometimes too personal and lacking in empirical data. Overall, it confirms a lay person's observations, but offers no framework on which to pursue further study.
B000301YY8|5.0|This CD is too awesome for words. I am a 55 year old grandma & I can't get enough of this CD.  I saw him on oprah, I want to adopt him!!  Every song is beautiful!!
B000BTGY1O|5.0|The film Breakfast At Tiffany's is a classic. No doubt, although I will not say it is Audrey's best film. I love Sabrina. But, its right up there. I don't think too many people need to be told what this film is about, and there are so many reviews around that would be better than mine. So I will reviw the DVD itself.  <br />This was my 3rd copy of this film (one was a present), but since there are not a lot of features on any of Audrey's DVD's, and this one had a feature just on her, I couldn't resist. <br />The featurette: It's Just So Audrey is really good and features lots of clips of her and all her fashion. It's only 8 minutes long, but its nice. <br />The 'making of'doco is cool, except there are no interviews from Audrey but I suppose they might be hard to track down.  <br />There are a few other interesting bits, and the whole thing comes in a nice boxed cover. The only disapointment is that there's no booklet. But I did get a booklet with the Paramount Classic's Gold Edition.  <br />
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This soundtrack is absolutely awesome. If you've seen the musical Wicked and enjoyed it, you'll love this CD. I wasn't lucky enough to see the original broadway cast on stage, and now I wish I would have. Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth have the most beautiful voices ever. After seeing the show and hearing Idina on the soundtrack, I understand why she won the Tony award, what an amazing talent. It just makes me want to see the show over and over, but since I can't I listen to this CD constantly.
0743201140|4.0|I never got to take the test because after I paid Amazon.com the price to get a book they said was \\"new\\";  they sent me a book that the \\"code\\" was \\"invalid / alreeady used\\".   My wife went through this material and took the test and had high praise for it,  thus I thought it would be of benefit to me.  I will never know because Amazon.com screwed me - - then sent my money back without so much as even a \\"We're sorry\\">
0451207521|3.0|Good book, it keep my interest.  I belong to a book club and this was one of the books that was on the list.
B000244EMO|4.0|It had been a long time sence I'd seen Predator. It was a good movie if you like Arnold.I like it cause it had a lot of action from start to finish.
B00005JO9J|5.0|This is a must have for any Grey's Anatomy lover, at a good price too!  See all nine episodes from the first season, definitely a great way to fill in all the spots you may have missed!  The one negative thing I could find:  show stops and goes to a black screen for a split second where original comercial breaks were.  Other TV shows on DVD do not.
B000089CPF|5.0|I absolutely love Calexico's version of \\"Alone Again Or\\" on the Austin Music Fest CD from 2004, and was more than pleasantly surprised at this CD. The best part about it: it's NEVER boring.  <br /> <br />Too many CDs (especially Pop music cr*p) sound like they took one song, and replayed the same tune over and over, substituting banal lyrics and calling it \\"art.\\"  <br /> <br />Guess what kids? THIS is art. Thoughtful lyrics, complex arrangements, and combinations of styles like Jazz, Country and Latin make this a superb CD.
B000B8QF14|3.0|Punk is dead... the ''dookie'' days are over... need to say more?
B00005U122|5.0|This concert is a work of art. The video and audio quality are excellent. The entire concert is a powerful reminder of the part Roger Waters played in the success of Pink Floyd and also showcases his contribution to music as a solo artist. Roger Waters has been rumored to be a perfectionist, and thankfully he must have been in his involvement with the making of this DVD. It is one of those near perfect concerts on DVD that will stand up to many viewings.
B00005RHF8|1.0|This is by far the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre there. Not only do the characters not look anything like they should, but George C. Scott pretending to be British??? Please, give me a break!!! Run, don't walk, as far away from this version as possible.
B000B8QG4A|1.0|I bought the special edition DVD set and after sitting through 5 minutes of previews for films which must be making Walt turn over in his grave, I was greeted with....nothing.  I could get as far as the government warnings about copy right infringement and then nothing...no picure, no sound, no main feature.  I could hear the disc running, but no movie.  After several attempts with that disc and one exchange later, I am currently without Lady and the Tramp.  I have no problems with any other disc, except the newly released Howl's Moving Castle...also a Disney two disc special.  I've encountered the same problem with that set.  I am unable to actually access the movie itself, but the previews work fine.  Is there something I'm not aware of???? <br /> <br />
B00000G3PL|5.0|These are some of my favorite movies and they came in perfect condition! I recommend this to anyone who is already a Lethal Weapon fan or anyone who wants to get into the series. They are good movies all around with plenty of action and laughs too.
B000BMSU68|3.0|Ferris Bueller's Day Off is without question one of my favorite movies.  I've seen it many times and when it was first released I was going into the seventh grade.  It's one of the many movies I grew up on so it obviously has a special place in my heart.  Having said that I was disappointed with the Bueller....Bueller...Bueller.  The extras are okay but unspectacular.  The mini documentary containing interviews with cast members then and now doesn't offer any insights of great depth and magnitude, just the usual, it was a wonderful experience tripe, though you do learn that Matthew Broderick and Alan Ruck, who plays Ferris's best friend Cameron, became buddies while performing on Broadway in Neil Simon's Biloxi Blues.  There's a making of doc that was made back when the movie was released in 1986.  Writer-director John Hughes can be seen in interviews from that year but he's conspicuously absent from the interviews taped for this DVD. It would have been nice to hear what he has to say now. A good DVD that is worth having, especially if you're a fan of the movie but it could have been better.
B000BNTM96|5.0|If you love QOTSA, like i do, you must buy this DVD. HIGHLY RECOMENDED!! LAS REINAS DE LA EDAD DE PIEDRA SON LO MEJOR!!!
B000A6T1HC|5.0|Very enjoyable. The singer's range and abilities are exceptionable. Highly recomended for the opera fan
B000001G5H|4.0|Pollini took pains as a young artist to mature to his fullest before giving concerts, and this 1972 recital of Chopin Etudes is a leap ahead of his debut disc on EMI. He was always perfecting a combination of edge-of-the-seat virtuosity, musical integrity, and modernist revision of Romantic style that has stood him well for forty years. However, despite the alluring technique and aristocratic bearing, his early pianism wasn't fully fledged yet. Too much of the music on his debut CD is played for surface values without searching deeper. By 1975, when he came to record the 24 Preludes, however, Pollini had grown considerably, and even now his artistry seems to gain in depth year by year--his recent concerts in Carnegie Hall have been miraculous.<br /><br />I am not a piano fancier, so it satisfies me to own this one recording of the Etudes and a few others. Even so, the performance is badly hampered by glassy, harsh sound. One can't listen at loud volume thanks to the brittle edge imparted to the piano. With remastering, Pollini's musicianship would certainly acquire another dimension of power and beauty. I wonder if DG did a remastering for their complete Pollini Edition?<br /><br />P.S. 2013 - For anyone who wants to hear the Etudes recorded in better sound, Testament has released Pollini's first recording, made in Sept. 1960 (over ten days of sessions!) when the pianist was a blazing newcomer of eighteen. He was demanding and fussy, and eventually he disallowed the release of the recording. Now it has resurfaced and displays all the artistry one would expect. The later reading is more polished and articulate in the pristine way of mature Pollini, but I'm grateful to be able to hear him in better sonic surroundings.
0451196716|5.0|King at his best... How many times has King had that written about him? Stephen's ealiest stories, from my point of view, were his best. And this one is definitely one of his earliest. Go for a long walk with King. You'll get a great story and a pretty good study of the Human condition to boot.
0064471047|5.0|The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is about four children named, from oldest to youngest, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie. They were sent to an old professor's house because of the air raids in London. On one cold, rainy day, the children decided to explore the house. The came into a rather empty room, only filled with a very large wardrobe. They saw that nothing of interest was there, so they left, except for Lucy. She wanted to open the door to the wardrobe and stepped inside. What she found inside was not just the back of the wardrobe but an entire wood all covered in snow. While walking a little through the forest, she met a faun named Mr. Tumnus. He brought her to a den in which he was about to turn her in to the white which, who was making all of Narnia, the world Lucy had came in, winter with no Christmas. Mr. Tumnus realized he had to let her go and help her escape. When she returned to the wardrobe, it wasn't even a second after she had left. One other day, the children decided to play hide-and-seek. Lucy went almost directly to the wardrobe room. Just as she stepped in, Edmund saw her go in and decided to follow and tease her, when he found himself also in Narnia. There he met the White Witch. He gave him some food and drink and told him to bring his siblings to her house. When the White Witch left, Lucy found Edmund and they both went back to the wardrobe room. When Lucy told Peter and Susan that Edmund had gotten in too, Edmund said that he had been playing and pretending with Lucy. The house in which the professor lives in, is one of those houses in which many sightseers came to look at. One day, a whole group of them were there with Mrs. Macready. So all the children went into the wardrobe room and hid in the wardrobe and backed up until all the children ended up in Narnia. They had decided to go visit Mr. Tumnus when they found his house had been destroyed and Mr. Tumnus pulled off to prison. Outside, they saw Mr. Beaver who led them to hishome on a frozen river. There Mrs. Beaver and Mr. Beaver told the four children the entire prophecy, when suddenly they had realized that Edmund had gone. Mr. Beaver said they had to leave right away for Aslan at the stone table because the White Witch had gotten Edmund to betray them. At the Stone Table, Aslan and his entire army had gotten ready for a great war. Aslan sent a party of centaurs to chase after a wolf at their camp. This wolf lead them to the White Witch's camp and they were able to bring back Edmund. A couple of days later, their armies clashed. Aslan had went to the White Witch's Castle to revive all those that she had turned to stone. With those extra reinforcements they were able to win the battle. Peter was crowned high king, and Susan, Edmund, and Lucy became king and queens. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this book because it was almost impossible to put down. The description made it feel like you were actually there and could feel what they were feeling and experience what they were experiencing. For example, this sentence made me feel like a picture was elaborately painted in my mind,\\"And out in the middle, and partly on top of the dam was a funny little house shaped rather like an enormous beehive and from a hole in the roof smoke was going up, so that when you saw it (especially if you were hungry)you at once thought of cooking and became hungrier than you were before.\\" That made me feel probably just as those Pevensie children felt when they saw it.  <br /> <br />There was nothing in general about this book that I didn't enjoy. Nothing except in one moment when Edmund lied that he hadn't been in Narnia. I felt extremely sorry for Lucy. If I were her I probably would have shouted at Edmund for lying and being beastly. Despite that one moment, the story was really great. The best moment was probably when Aslan revived the lion. The description was just beautiful. \\"Then a tiny streak of gold began to run along his white marble back-then the color seemed to lick all over him as the flame lick all over a bit of paper-then, while his hindquearters were still obviously stone, the lion shook his mane and all the heavy, stone folds ripple into living hair.\\" Reading that description was just impossible to describe with words.
006054094X|1.0|While the book contains many interesting bits of information, the manner in which those bits are woven into a skein supporting Menzie's hypotheses borders on the scurrilous.  This work suffers from a severe lack of scholarly integrity, as well as Menzie's overwrought and often fantastic conclusions based on the thinnest of so-called \\"evidence.\\"  The author's exuberance for his own radical hypotheses clearly clouds his judgment and conclusions.  This is a shame because there is probably some truth to at least some of Menzie's claims.
B000002H97|5.0|i love metallica. comparing this cd to their older stuff it is a little different. the songs (tracks) are not as long as they were (10 mins per song - hahaha) just keep in mind that they're growing as musicians. i especially enjoy \\"sad but true\\" and \\"don't tread on me\\". just play the cd in your car, crank it and yell \\"YAH!!!\\"
B00005MP58|5.0|This Pride and Prejudice was the best.  The ciminotgraphy (sp?) was the best.  Although the movie is very long, it is a complex story and the time must be spent to do it justice.  The nuances of the British caste system are not easily related to the American audience and care must be taken so that each one is understood.  <br /> <br />The characters are very developed and much care has been taken with each one.  Mr. Bennett is not unlike any father of 5 girls (with no sons) and Mrs. Bennett is a sight-her character is well played by the actress.  Elizabeth is a classic beauty, handsome is the term the film uses, and is well played by the actress as well. The remainder of the characters, especially Colin Firth, play their characters to a tee.   <br /> <br />The actress that plays Ms. Bingly was the funniest however.  She was perfectly cast as the sister of a man whose friend she would like to marry.  The comments and looks were so funny, and a great example that not much has changed since Ms. Austin wrote the book - females can be as petty as the day is long! <br />
B000DZIGDU|3.0|This movie isn't the kind of action that you'd regularly expect from a war movie. But, that doesn't mean that it isn't a good movie. There are a lot of symbols and if you can think deeply about how it would be to wait for someone to bomb you or sneak up on you while you sleep, think of the stress you would be under and thats what this movie is about. If you're looking for action you will find little here but if you're just looking for a good movie about soldiers and their troubles you'll find it here.
0395645662|4.0|The Giver <br />By: Lois Lowry <br />Reviewed by: J. Ho <br />P.1 <br /> <br />        The Giver is about a boy named Jonas. Jonas lived in a perfect small town governed by many rules. He gets excited about his ceremony of twelve years old because he gets assigned to his adult job. His job was to become the receiver of memories, or all the experience of the world. During his training, he experienced real world feelings that he was unable to experience in his perfect little town. After seeing what a \\"release\\" is and hearing that a newborn was going to be released, he couldn't stand living in the village anymore. He planned his and the newborn's escape from the village with the memory giver. In the end, Jonas and the baby were able to escape the village. There were some things I liked and disliked about the story. <br />    <br />        The part where there was the war scene was a part I didn't like. \\"Dirt streaked the boy's face and his matted blond hair. He lay sprawled, his uniform glistening with wet, fresh blood.\\" The war scene was really sad. A kid had to go to war and even got badly injured. \\"The colors of the carnage were grotesquely bright: the crimson wetness on the rough and dusty fabric, the ripped shreds of grass, startlingly green, in the boys yellow hair.\\" The scene was described in a sort of gory way because I pictured a place with lots of blood everywhere on the ground. There was another part in the story I disliked. <br /> <br />        The part where the newborn was released was another part I detested. \\"To his surprise, his father began very carefully to direct the needle into the top of newchild's forehead, puncturing the place where the fragile skin pulsed. The newborn squirmed and wailed faintly.\\" I felt sad for the baby. I knew that taking a shot at that area meant that there something bad was going to happen to the baby. \\"As he continued to watch, the newchild, no longer crying, moved his arms and legs in a jerking motion. Then he went limp.His head fell to the side, his eyes half open. Then he was still.\\" This quote from the story confirmed my guess about something bad happening to the baby. The baby was killed. There was also a part of the story that I liked. <br /> <br />        I liked the part where Jonas escapes with Gabe, a newborn. \\"'So,' Father went on, `we obviously had to make the decision. Even I voted for Gabriel's release when we had the meeting this afternoon.'... But it was necessary because it had the child seat attached to the back. And he had taken Gabriel too.\\" Jonas was very brave to risk his life to save someone else even though he is a kid himself. \\"He wept because he was afraid now that he could not save Gabriel. He no longer cared about himself.\\" Jonas acted very kind. He put the well-being of the baby in front of himself.  <br />
B0009PVZWI|2.0|So many of the reviews here ridicule this CD solely on the basis that it's copy protected. That's TRULY unfair. I hate copy protection as much as the next person, but the whole point of these reviews is to talk about the material on the CD itself to help potential listeners in their decision to buy the product, and that's what I'm going to do.<br /><br />This CD stinks.<br /><br />Aside from the nonsense I had to go thru to get around the copy protection to put it on my iPod, this could have been one relatively great CD and instead it's a totally subpar 2-CD set. Since the RIAA counts a 2CD set as two CD's sold toward a platinum award I'm pretty sure I understand *why* Grohl and company did this. But they should have put better material on the CDs, especially the second disc.<br /><br />The first disc, for the most part is pretty good. However, the second disc is bad - really bad. In fact it's so bad that I actually started falling asleep driving home listening to it. Now, if that's what Dave Grohl was striving for - to increase the number of road fatalities due to people nodding off at the wheel - he might very well have succeeded.<br /><br />Honestly, I think it's time to bid adieu to the Foo Fighters. The magic that made \\"The Colour and The Shape\\" what it was is obviously long gone. Go do another Probot disc, Dave... Mothball the Foo - obviously you don't care any more.
B00000FCBC|5.0|this is metallica at play. everytime i listen to them it feels like they're playing just for me. listening to this cd is just that i'm kicking it with them as they play and play. they're playing songs that are not theirs but they metallicanized them. listening to mr. hetfield sing \\"last caress/green hill\\" is one of the reasons why i bought this 2 part cd. i also loved the way they improved \\"stone cold crazy\\". \\"breadfan\\" is another favorite of mine. my all time favorite of the boys at play is \\"so what\\" that song i could never get out of my head. i listen to disc 2 the most, disc 1 is as good. it's worth the purchase.
B000058983|5.0|<br />I believe I purchased this LP when it came out due to the cover art and the titles of the songs.  That has been a good thing for me through the years as I've come across some gems that would have otherwise been overlooked.  I was familiar with Love's previous songs, but was not prepared for what I was about to hear and experience.  To this very day, it is a CD that I play at least several times a month.  I couldn't believe that they were capable of such an effort.  Through the years, it became evident that Bryan MacLean's creativity was the underlying quality that made Love advance beyond \\"Hey Joe\\" and \\"My Little Red Book.\\"  I had the opportunity to see a reincarnation of Love with Arthur Lee in 2004 when they were touring with the Zombies.  Arthur had become hardened and angry due in some respects to his years spent behind bars, but he also took swipes at Bryan MacLean downplaying his role in the most notable project of Love's short recording span.  Even with his put downs and obvious ego issues, it didn't damper my desire or change how I feel about this outstanding recording.  It was also obvious that the Zombies were blowing him away.  You could immediately tell the difference in talent and class, but I'll save this for a Zombies review. <br /> <br />From the opening of \\"Alone Again Or\\" through to the end with \\"You Set the Scene,\\" you will be taken through a host of emotions with extreme levels of despair and some hope.  \\"Old Man\\" is an incredible piece of work and relevant in my life even at age 22 when I first heard this song.  It's not an album one would play for a gathering of friends as it is better suited for a more personal environment.  Use a set of headphones to capture the nuances and words as they are sometimes difficult to decipher. <br /> <br />This is one of my favorite, all-time albums and is one that I will take to the hereafter! <br /> <br />

0385513755|1.0|[...]<br /><br />This book is Groovy, dude! It's Fo' Shizzle man. It's about this idiot Harvard Professor who makes up a whole bunch of junk about Jesus and stuff. He thinks that Davinci is gay (probably because he is gay), and he thinks Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene, even though the Bible never says anything to suggest that. Wow! He was obviously smokin' somethin' weird. But that's not the half of it. He thinks that the Holy Grail is Jesus' bloodline! WOW! I've got just one question for him. Have you ever seen \\"Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade\\"? Honestly man, Indiana clearly finds the Holy Grail in that. It wasn't even a person; it was a wooden cup thingy! I don't think there could be another Holy Grail, or Indy would have found that one too. This book also has a really contrived story and a forced ending. I think that the author was probably a crazy retard, and wanted to spout his crazy, ludicrous views in a way that non-crazy people could understand. You HAVE to buy this book, it's super fantastic!
B0000AQS0F|4.0|For about the first hour of the pilot I was a little unsure, perhaps I'm just used to the more \\"standard\\" sci-fi. By the time the pilot was over however, I was really into the story, the characters and the action! <br />I won't go into a lot of details, but if you're a sci-fi fan and you've not seen Firefly - you should definetly get this DVD set. Like me, you'll be glad you did. Too bad some short sighted executives didn't give the show a fair chance. <br />I hear the movie is good though!
B000CNESU8|5.0|Paddy Chayefsky is one of those writers that are relevant in any time (he died at the age of 58), and what could be more relevant in this era than his 1976 film NETWORK (directed by Sidney Lumet)? Just as Stanley Kubrick hung out the absurdities of the Cold War for all to see in DR. STRANGELOVE (OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BOMB), a film that only becomes more and more potent as time goes on (especially now), so Chayefsky and Lumet attack with full force the TV news industry and its \\"bastardization\\" via corporate control, entertainment masquerading as news, and ratings. The centerpiece of this movie is Howard Beale (the late, great Peter Finch) and his psychotic ramblings that are cynically exploited for the network's gain. And it's also about the people in the network that care only about ratings, especially Diana Christensen (brilliantly played by Faye Dunaway, a truly great actress), programming executive, and Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall, in one of his greatest roles), the new head of the network. Also involved in the madness is Max Schumacher (the truly great actor William Holden), head of the news division and best friend of Beale that ends up having an affair with Diana, and Arthur Jensen (Ned Beatty, who is incredible), the CEO of the corporation that owns the network. <br /> <br />Watching NETWORK 30 years later, with the way television is going now in mind, it is even more astounding to watch the absurdities of the story unfold. Howard Beale's psychotic ramblings about the state of television and the world have a certain herrange-like quality, especially the infamous \\"I'M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!\\" speech! Equally memorable is Jensen's speech about corporations and businesses ruling the world, with Beatty's fire-and-brimstone delivery  (\\"YOU HAVE MEDDLED WITH THE PRIMAL FORCES OF NATURE MR. BEALE, AND I WON'T HAVE IT!\\") lending weight to the absurdity of the story. And in the advent of reality television, the story arc with Laureen Hobbs and her left-wing militia getting their own show is especially funny, especially when they bicker about distribution costs and overhead. <br /> <br />In a time when television is becoming a joke unto itself, NETWORK will never lose its satirical bite. In fact, like DR. STRANGELOVE, Chayefsky's take on network news and television in general will grow more and more potent over the years. And it has one of the greatest punchlines I've ever heard. I consider NETWORK one of the finest movies ever made.
B000002UAO|5.0|Let me state this right now, there were the Beatles, then everyone else.  The music world in the early 60's was stagnate.  With the exception of the Beach Boys and Elvis, nothing much notable was coming from the world of AM radio. Sure, there were some hits, but as soon as they dropped of the charts, they were basically forgotten.  The Beatles changed all of that.  More importantly, they changed us by giving us the opportunity to sing, laugh, scream and be carefree for the two minutes and 30 seconds of whatever song it was being played at the time.  Every new release was cause for celebration.  Today, we still have them giving us the same emotions thanks to records, CD's and film.  We are better off with them in our lives.    I decided to make Rubber Soul my first review of a Beatle album as this is where they left the 'Beatlemania' mode for more insightful and personal exposure into their lives.  With the help and patience of George Martin, they were able to change our lives again!  This is where we finally got to look inside of them, especially John; \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" \\"Nowhere Man,\\" \\"Girl\\" and \\"In My Life.\\"  It took George and Paul a little longer, and Ringo...well, he's just Ringo the greatest rock and roll drummer of all-time.  Just listen to his chops on \\"Strawberry Fields Forever.\\"  What they did with what recording technology was available at the time was unheard of.  They continued to push the technology envelope with the guidance of George Martin and the resultant creativity that emerged from every session.  If you are just starting out in building your Beatle collection, 'Rubber Soul' is a good place to start, but be prepared to expand your collection.
B000000WA4|4.0|According to Wikipedia, \\"Melon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\" sold more copies (9.4 million) than all of the other Smashing Pumpkin albums combined.  That's pretty darn impressive for a double cd, which followed the all-time classic, \\"Siamese Dreams.\\"  Listening to the entire two hours of M.C./I.S. is both an experience and a challenge of sorts.  The stark differences between the songs dazzles at times, but can sometimes become tedious as well.      Of course, one first notices the Alice in Wonderland/ fairy tale styled art-work, especially in the included pamphlet which depicts rabbits playing baseball, rodents in a hookah bar, children with a lamb in a flower field, and cats getting married.  And the the music starts with an introductory piano piece which blends perfectly into perhaps one of the most over-the-top theatrical rock songs I've ever heard this side of Queen -- \\"Tonight Tonight.\\"  Over the course of the two discs, we hear everything from meditative lullabies to thrash metal, all with opaque lyrics, mostly (I presume) about loneliness, love and desire.      I think after listening to the album a bunch of times, I can try to place these songs into three categories.  The first category consist of the exceptional songs on the album, which are as follows:     1. Intro/Tonight, Tonight -- pretentious perhaps, but I just find it so wonderfully dramatic and full of hope.  A perfect introduction to what follows.    2. Zero -- It's no coincidence that Corgan's shirt says \\"Zero\\" in the picture over the liner notes. Besides the ironic connotation, he must have realized this song was a winner, with its crunching riff and that great stanza that begins with \\"emptiness is loneliness ...\\"    3. Bullet With Butterfly Wings -- Wow, what a great song.  Comparable (and similar in some ways) to Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\\"  A fabulous opening line and chorus.  And listen to Billy's rage come through when he shrieks out the word \\"cage.\\"    4. Love -- not everyone loves \\"Love,\\" but I think it really stands out with Corgan's muffled vocals and controlled fury.    5. Muzzle -- Is it possible not to like this song?  Just a joy to listen to.    6. 1979 -- Perfect in every way.  Almost achingly beautiful, with a nostalgic feel and an infectious bass line.    7. Thru the Eyes of Ruby -- Everything this band can do is represented here in this one song.  Give it another listen if you don't think so.    The second category of songs, represent the \\"chaff\\" -- the songs that, if omitted, would have made this into a clearly better album (and elevated it even above \\"Siamese Dream\\"):    1-2. The two James Iha tracks -- just plain boring, and without purpose on this album, given both songs follow an already superior, mellow, closing-type track.    3. Cupid De Locke - Pollyanna drivel.  Spinal Tap could have had a field day with this.    4. Tales of a Scorched Earth -- Corgan expands his shriek of the word \\"cage\\" in \\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\\" and inexplicably makes it into an almost unbearable song.    5-8. The four songs after the pretty \\"Stumbleine\\" --  Just skip through all of them (they're basically worthless) and increase my rating to five stars.    Category 3 would be all the other songs which range from really good (i.e. Galapagos, Stumbleine) to O.K.      The Smashing Pumpkins first three albums can hold up to comparisons with almost any other band's first three.  What happened?

There are various songs I love from all her albums but I have to say, my new favorites come from this album. She really poured her heart into it.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|After hearing the rumors of a possible 'Floyd' reunion w/Waters and Company, then Gilmour's denial of such a thing, I was anxious to hear in what direction he would take his new recording efforts.  Not being overly impressed with his previous two releases, I was hoping for a little more of the 'Floyd' influence and fortunately that is what we got. Though it is not a full-blown production, it is comforting to know that he is not denying his roots and playing what he does  best.  Having listened to the CD several times now, I am becoming more in tune with the flow and emotion involved.  Thanks David!

Many, many pages of small print could probably be condensed down to less than 200 pages of a larger font.  Worth reading for a complete bicylce geek other wise time would probably be better spent reading other bicycle books.  However, does provide some interesting trivia such as a person could pedal a 100 miles on a gallon of milk and gave a distance for a gallon of petrol, though I forgot the distance.

B00005JOFO|3.0|Any director deserves the Oscar when able to depict an otherwise very common story, in an outstanding way, full of symbols that haunt with melancholy.  The plot centers(taking out their sex, that was bizarre-not because homophobia- among any loving sex) on the story of any gay couple at that time.  Denial, Hiding,Shame Wives to cover it up, etc.  Anyone who has heard this tale, goes knowing the twists and turns.    Make the men cowboys for cultural iconic shock effect, a tool for marketing writers.  Put them in a paradise, to help create a romantic mood.  Again, the story is told well, but if on top of that you use a paradise as the background, people are going   to root for Oscar.  Probably not many people have heard about the lives of a gay couple in the 60's.  But that doesn't mean is an original tale.

B0000669JL|5.0|There are a handful of albums that I see in just about every house that I visit.  Bob Marley-Legend is one of them.  Everyone seems to love his songs and I think the main reason is their simplicity.  Marley seems to be able to strip music to it's simplest form and deliver messages so relevant but without the pretentiousness that most artist impose.   <br /> <br />Think of Reggae and Bob Marley immediately comes to mind. He has put this genre on the map and made it his own.  He has mastered the genre to make the most wonderful and chilled out songs ever recorded.  Played from beginning to end, this collection will take away all your worries and chill your soul.  A great summer's day album to play whilst relaxing in your yard and equally good music to play in the background of a nice social gathering.  One time I was in a chillout bar and they had the whole album on in the background and not one tune seemed out of place, in fact it helped tremendously with the atmosphere. <br /> <br />Music doesn't get more honest than this.  Simplicity and beauty with a strong thread of genius interwoven throughout. this collection of songs shows clearly why Bob Marley is heralded in such high regard by millions of people worldwide.  He touches everyone who hears his music, which is just about the full population of the planet.   <br /> <br />One of the greatest collections of an artist's work and rightfully titled.  Bob Marley was, and still is, a legend.

Some songs are haunting and delicate, some straightforward rock n' roll.  If you could combine this album with his other album of the same time period, \\"Demolition\\", you would have probably the most complete and heartfelt album ever made.

0385503954|5.0|I have not read such a good, magically absorbing novel in a long time! The plot is constructed beautifully, without a flaw. The first part, which is also the longest, describes only one day - and during this day the reader is given the detailed portraits of all the characters (practically enough to feel like any of them), the author builds the tension up to the climax (at the end of the first part), and very believably describes the surroundings and the time.<br /><br />That day in 1935, when there is a lingering shadow of the war, but at the same time its perspective is so remote that all the other aspects of normal life seem to go on normally. The Tallis family in the English countryside mansion prepares for dinner celebrating the visit of the son, Leon. The story in this part is told from the point of view of the youngest sister, thirteen-year old Briony, who has an overgrown imagination and wants to become a writer. To honor her brother, she prepared a play, but some events, invisible perhaps to the others (like jealousy for her two years older and feminine cousin, Lola), lead her to abandon the project of its staging. At the same time, we are witnesses to the love emerging between the older sister, Cecilia, and the son of the resident charlady, Robbie, both freshly back from college. The development of their awareness of the feelings to each other and mutual desire, only in this single day, is exceptionally caught. Briony's fragmentary observations of the couple and her extensive use of the imagination lead to the tragedy, which changes the lives of Robbie and Cecilia forever and lead Briony (very slowly though) into deeper and deeper feeling of guilt.<br /><br />McEwan pushes the reader gently to the right direction, without too much leading and showing the obvious, but it is easy, reading carefully, notice all that he wants to show, ever so subtly. The language is rich, but crystal clear, without any excessive ornamentation, nothing unnecessary, all the words have their use either in the plot, or in the construction of the mood. The next parts create a perfect counterbalance, everything calms down, gets from the complete chaos to the natural order, more static situation - the circumstances are, for a change, very dramatic (a middle of the war actions, a hospital).<br /><br />Already the story, the moral problem and its presentation, are a great start and enough for praise. But there is more, since there is a lot of metatext, comments about literature and the author's role (mostly put into Briony's mouth, but also in the editorial letter from \\"The Horizon\\"), and the ending makes a twist, when old Briony thinks about her story, considering different possible endings. This makes the reader realize that what they just passed through, is just fiction, the writer, its creator, is like God in the fictional world and we are at the end not any closer to the truth than we were at the beginning.<br /><br />I could praise McEwan into infinity here, so as the last sentence I will just say that another of his achievements as a writer is that each of his works is truly original and unique, there is no self-plagiarism in any sense, no repetitive themes, only the ease with which he uses English and his ingenuity remain the same. Five stars don't do him justice.words have their use either in the plot, or in the construction of the mood.

I just cannot get enough of this show, and sadly, there is not enough of it to even come close. Who was the MORON at Fox that canceled this show??? <br /> <br />SCI-FI Channel?? USA?? TNT?? Is anybody out there?? <br /> <br />Firefly is one of the best shows to be created in this millenium, easily the \\"Seinfled\\" of Sci-Fi.

I guess the execs at NBC are much smarter than their Fox counterparts. <br /> <br />Brilliant writing, beautifully scored, and the tightest ensemble cast since Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer were left sitting in jail. <br /> <br />Is there a network brave enough to stop pandering to the empty-headed reality craze and actually produce something worth watching?
B00004RF9B|5.0|Great movie. This movie was the forerunner of Star Trek. If you like robots and alien planets mixed with action, this is the flick for you.

B000BM6AVA|2.0|I should have listened to people when they said that Mezmerize and Hypnotize were one album split into two to make more money.  I basically found that point to be true the second I cracked open the case and found out that it's a \\"special case\\" that connects to Mezmerize to make an entire comprehensive album.  Thus I've spent twice as much for one album instead of just waiting for (what I figure will be the eventual) rereleased comprehensive edition that is both of them put together for much cheaper.<br /><br />However, as to be fair to the band itself, I will spend a moment on this review to go into the music:<br /><br />Unfortunately bland.<br /><br />It has a lot of the same stuff that System of a Down does, so it's okay to listen to.  I liked Mezmerize because it was a more electronically produced version of what they do (most people hated it for that very reason... hey, bands are allowed to spend some time producing their albums, okay?  Would you prefer to see a movie before it's cut for continuity?).  This one is the same way, but since it isn't fresh it's kind of boring.<br /><br />Maybe this analogy will work without angering too many people: delaying half a pizza for months and then releasing it for the price of a full pizza seems like a pretty mean thing to do in the first place, but then the fact that the second half of the pizza has had all that time to rot and grow moldy makes it somewhat insulting.  Warning to System of a Down and any other band who attempts to do something like this again: don't.  I will begin to boycott immediately.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB

B00004XQ83|4.0|I remember watching the Grammys a few years ago, and being struck by the fact that the soundtrack recording to Oh Brother Where Art Thou did better than anyone could possibly imagine - in fact, it managed to win Album of the Year, and T-Bone Burnett got to go up and give a fine acceptance speech. I remember at the time thinking that there is more soul in Ralph Stanley singing one line of \\"Oh Death\\" than there is in perhaps 90% of the tacky crap in its entirety played on today's most commercial radio stations. Part of the greatness, then, of this terrific soundtrack was its accomplishment of exposing lots of people to roots/bluegrass music (as well as to the Coen Brothers).<br /><br />Listening to this recording now, it still stands up, filled as it is with some inspired, heartfelt representations of what has been known by some as weird, old America. In fact, even though these are modern recreations of something old, it kind of gives me a chill to consider the homespun beauty of the originals. It would seem that once one listens a few times to these well crafted homages, one wound move back, toward the past, to hear what the originals must have been like.

B0000024R8|5.0|I was recently listening to this, Bob Dylan's 1st record, which is entitled, appropriately enough Bob Dylan. It's a great record, even though only a few of the songs are Dylan originals; it contains some classic tunes, like House of the Rising Son and a song later associated with the film Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? - Man of Constant Sorrow, not to mention the tune, In My Time of Dying which was later covered by the British band Spacemen 3 (with their trippy version called Come Down Easy.) Dylan's wit, originality, fine musical instincts, and his embracing of such kindred spirits as Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, Leadbelly, Ramblin' Jack Elliot, and Jack Kerouac all come shining through. He sounds unpolished, and that is a very good thing; heard in the context of the folk music boom of the 1950s and early 60s, in which folk was smoothed over as easy listening music for mass consumption, Dylan is truly a diamond in the rough. He sounds like someone you'd go to a small folk club, and not on the Ed Sullivan Show, to hear. And in his Song To Woody, Dylan's obvious love for Woody Guthrie and all he stands for comes convincingly across.<br /><br />Well, as I was listening to it, it occurred to me that, while Bob Dylan\\" was released in 1962, it was recorded in 1961, the year of my birth. 1961 was the year that John Hammond signed Dylan to a recording contract after seeing him perform in the clubs of lower Manhattan, where Dylan lived after leaving Minnesota.<br /><br />That same year, on the other side of the ocean, a young British fan happened to walk into a Liverpool record shop to ask the proprietor, Brian Epstein, if he had any copies of the song \\"My Bonnie,\\" which had been recorded by the then relatively unknown Beatles; Epstein sought the band out, a year later they had a recording contract, and the rest is history.<br /><br />1961 was the year that a charismatic young president took office; the hopes and dreams of America, and indeed, the world, for peace, freedom, and equality, which were projected onto and associated with Kennedy and Camelot were not unlike the ideals that were associated with the songs of Bob Dylan, particularly those which offered social and political commentary; also, it has been suggested by many that the emergence of the Beatles in America a few years later in 1964 was a means of helping a grieving nation to get over some of its grief and to start feeling happy again. In any event, the 60s were by then well under way.<br /><br />Dylan, then, gets his start here, and as the 60s unravelled in some surprising ways, so too would Dylan with later turns in his magnificent, unique musical career.re projected onto and associated with Kennedy and Camelot were not unlike the ideals that were associated with the songs of Bob Dylan, particularly those which offered social and political commentary; also, it has been suggested by many that the emergence of the Beatles in America a few years later in 1964 was a means of helping a grieving nation to get over some of its grief and to start feeling happy again.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Funny and stylish, with a clever mix of the 'old western' themes and good SCI-FI. I felt sometimes like I was watching 'Alias Smith and Jones' rather than a space flick - which did not detract at all! The humour (for a US show) was first rate, with plenty of ironic moments. Well worth a watch!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|most other reviewers have summed up the storyline. So I'm just wanting to add that if you are a fan of period costume drama, you MUST see this. This wonderfully filmed Victorian mini series has a stunning cast of well portrayed characters.<br /><br />If you loved Colin Firth's Darcy in Pride and Prejudice-you will adore Richard Armitage emotional and romantically brooding portrayal of John Thornton. I predict that this role will propel Mr Armitage's career as P&P did for Firth. This is a timeless story of love, class struggle and family.<br /><br />You will want to buy this film instead of renting as you'll want to watch it again and again.<br /><br />5 stars!!!
0345440900|5.0|As a new mother of an infant daughter, at about 8 weeks, I was starting to lose a grip- my baby who had previously been quiet and easy going, became a nightmare every day from 6 - 10 pm. My husband and I were at our wits end. Then I remembered this book, and pulled it out to review. We put our daughter on E.A.S.Y immediately - and it was shocking what a big difference it made! She again became easy going and sweet. It took a big reminder from this book for me to really tune in to what was going on with her - and that I needed to always be listening for her cues to the next thing (read and you will understand). I have recommended this book to all of my pregnant friends, first or not... and purchased it for one recently. I highly recommend this book and it's suggestions. You may not be able to incorporate all of them, but it is definitely worth the read!
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Very amazing documentary.  Has a strong point of view and narrative concerning the life of Robert McNamara and lessons about war and the potential for war.  Very poignant points concerning the atomic bomb, Vietnam, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the fire bombing of Japan, and much more.  All issues are relevant today, perhaps more than ever.  A real must watch for anyone! Period!

B0000029GA|5.0|\\"Nas is like the afro-centric Asian, half-man half-amazing.\\" <br />It's been 12 years since this album was released and I'm still blown away just like I was in 1994. The title itself is so creative \\"Illmatic\\"  ...it represents a mysterious, extremely talented modern day prophet. I remember I copped the tape along with Enter the 36 Chambers at the same time. I was about to take a long road trip from VA to Texas so I had plenty of time to study each masterpiece word for word. Those two albums is what created the buzz that brought the East Coast back. Biggie came along later in the year and completed the resurrection. Nas reminded me so much of Rakim  ...his voice, delivery, that reserved demeanor which suggested he wasn't for the mainstream. All that contributed to the way n*ggas went crazy over the album. We all wanted more but had to settle for 10 tracks that we played over and over. Death Row was running sh*t at the time so Illmatic and the Wu was a breath of fresh air. Whenever I get bored with the fake thug or simple minded down south crunk bullsh*t I pop in Illmatic and zone out. Anytime you can get DJ Premier, Pete Rock, Large Professor, Q-Tip and LES on one album you have a classic on your hands. This is a MUST have for any true hip-hop fans collection! Here are my top 5 tracks: <br /> <br />1. It Ain't Hard to Tell  (Large Pro freaked the Human Nature sample) <br />2. World is Yours (\\"I sip the Don P watching Ghandi till I'm charged\\") <br />3. Halftime (that trumpet loop is crazy!) <br />4. Life's a Bitch  (introducing AZ) <br />5. NY State of Mind (\\"cuz sleep is the cousin of death\\")
B00005B36H|5.0|A review of this album just won't do it justice - words don't describe music like this: this masterpiece simply has to be experienced. It's very spiritual, but also very dark, brooding. It peaks, it quakes, softens, glistens, and glides. Drums pummel and make your heart quiver, and lush instrumentation calms the senses. I'm a hip hop head, understand - I'm not into hardcore rock and metal - but Tool is a band that simply obliterates that wall for me (at least while I'm listening to them). This album is powerful, and was a great way to start off the 21st century when it dropped. Excellent.
B00005JOE8|5.0|Alan Moore's decision to want his name off the final credits for the film adaptation of V for Vendetta now makes sense. Moore has had a hate/hate relationship with Hollywood and the film industry in general. They've taken two of his other works in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and From Hell and bollocks'd them up (to borrow a term used quite abit in V for Vendetta). Outside of Watchmen, Alan Moore sees V for Vendetta as one of his more personal works and after reading the screenplay adaptation of the graphic novel by The Wachowski Brothers his decision afterwards was to demand his name be removed from the film if it was ever made. Part of this was his hatred of the film industry for their past mistakes and another being his wish for a perfect adaptation or none at all. Well, V for Vendetta by James McTeigue and The Wachowski Brothers is not a perfect film adaptation. What it turns out to be is a film that stays true to the spirit of Moore's graphic novel and given a modern, up-to-the-current news retelling of the world's state of affairs.<br /><br />V for Vendetta starts off with abit of a prologue to explain the relevance of the Guy Fawkes mask worn by V throughout the film and the significance of the date of the 5th of November. I think this change in the story from the source material may be for the benefit of audiences who didn't grow up in the UK and have no idea of who Guy Fawkes was and what his Gunpowder Plot was all about. The sequence is short but informative. From then on we move on to the start of the main story and here the film adheres close enough to the source material with a few changes to the Evey character (played with skill that more than makes up for her Amidala performances) but not enough to ruin the character. Caught after curfew and accosted by the ruling government's secret police called Fingermen, Evey soon encounters V who saves her not just from imprisonment but rape.<br /><br />Right from the start the one thing McTeigue and The Wachowski Brothers got dead-on was casting Hugo Weaving as the title character. Voice silky, velvety and sonorous, Weaving infuses V with an otherworldly, theatrical personality. Whether V was speaking phrases from Shakespeare, philosophers or pop culture icons, the voice gave a character who doesn't show his face from behind the enternally-smiling Guy Fawkes mask real life. I'd forgiven the makers of this films for some of the changes they made to the story and some of the characters for keeping V as close to how Moore wrote him. Once V and Evey are thrown in together by the happenstance of that nightly encounter their fates became intertwined. Portman plays the reluctant witness to V's acts of terrorism, murders and destruction in the beginning, but a poignant and emotionally powerful sequence to start the second half of the film soon brings Evey's character not much towards V's way of doing things, but to understanding just why he's doing them. This sequence became the emotional punch of the whole film and is literally lifted word for word from the graphic novel. I heard more than just a few people sobbing in the theater as the scenes and story unfolded.<br /><br />The rest of the cast seemed like a who's who of the British acting community. From Stephen Rea's stubborn and dogged Chief Inspector Finch whose quest to find V leads him to finding clues about his government's past actions that he'd rather have not found. Then there's Stephen Fry's flamboyant TV show host who becomes Evey's only other ally whose secret longings have been forbidden by the government, but who's awakened by V's actions to go through with his own form of rebellion. Then there's John Hurt as High Chancellor Adam Sutler who's seen chewing up the scenery with his Hitler-like performance through Big Brother video conferences (an ironic bit of casting since John Hurt also played Winston Smith in the film adaptation of the Orwell classic 1984). I really couldn't find any of the supporting players as having done a bad job in their performances. Even Hurt's Sutler may seemed over-the-top to some but his performance just showed how much of a hatemonger Sutler and in the end his Norsefire party really were in order to stay in power.<br /><br />The story itself, as I mentioned earlier, had had some changes made to it. Some of these changes angered Moore and probably anger his more die-hard fans. I count myself as one of these die-hards, but I know how film adaptations of classic literary works must and need to trim some of the fat from the main body and theme of the story to fully translate onto the silver screen. The Wachowski Brother's screenplay did just that. They trimmed some of the side stories and tertiary characters from the story and concentrated on V, Evey and Inspector Finch's pursuit of both and the truth. This adaptation is much closer to how Peter Jackson adapted The Lord of the Rings. As a fan of Moore I understood why he was unhappy with the changes. But then Moore is also an avowed perfectionist and only a perfect adaptation would do.<br /><br />Already critics on both sides of the aisle have called V for Vendetta revolutionary, subversive, daring to irresponsible, propagandist. All because the film dares to ask serious questions about the nature and role of violence as a form of dissent. But the granddaddy question the film brings up that has people talking is the question: terrorist or freedom fighter? Is V one or the other or is he both? Make no mistake about it, V for all intents and purposes is a terrorist if one was to use the definition of what a terrorist is. The makers of this film goes to great lenghts to describe throughout the film just how Sutler and his Norsefire (with its iconic Nazi-like symbols and fundamentaist Christian thinking) party rose to power in the UK. Partly due to what seemed like the failed US foreign policy and its subsequent and destructive decline as a superpower and the worldwide panic and fear it began as a result. V for Vendetta also ask just who was to blame for allowing such individuals to rule over them. V has his reasons for killing these powers-that-be, but he also points out that people really should just look in the mirror if they need to know who really was to blame. For it was the population --- whose desire to remain safe and have a semblance of peace --- gave up more and more of their basic liberties and rights for a return to order. If one was to look at the past 100 years they would see that it's happened before. There was the regime of Pol Pot in Cambodia, Milosevic's Greater Serbia, and the king of the hill of them all being Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Inner Circle.<br /><br />Another thing about V for Vendetta that will surely talked about alot will be the images used in the film. Not just images and symbols looking so much like Nazi icons, but images from the current events sweeping the globe that has been shown time and time again in the news and written about in magazines and newspapers. The film shows people bound and hooded like prisoners from Abu Ghraib. The reason of the war on terror used time and time again by Sutler to justify why England and its people need him and his group to protect them by any means necessary. V for Vendetta seems like a timely film for our current times. Even with the conclusion of the film finally accomplishing what Guy Fawkes failed to do that night of November 5th some 400 plus years ago, V for Vendetta doesn't give all the answers to all the questions it raises. For some I'm sure this would be something that'll frustrate them. So much of people who go to watch thought-provoking films want their questions answered as clearly as possible and all of them. V for Vendetta doesn't answer them but gives the audience enough information to try and work it out themselves.<br /><br />In final analysis, V for Vendetta accomplishes in bringing the main themes of Alan Moore's graphic novel to life and even does it well despite someof the changes made. It is a film that is sure to polarize the extreme left and right of the political pundits and commentators. But as a piece of thought-provoking and even as a politically subversive film, V for Vendetta does it job well. It is not a perfect film by any respect, but the story and message it tries to convey in addition to its value as a piece of entertainment mor than makes up for its flaws. V for Vendetta more than continues the current crop of seriously done comic book fillm adaptations (Batman Begins, X2, Sin City, and A History of Violence) but it also shows that Alan Moore's work can be adapted well to the screen when given to the right people. It may not be perfect and it may not make Alan Moore happy, but it comes close and more than makes up for LXG and From Hell.began as a result.

B000BFH2S2|5.0|Buble really doesnt launch any ships, and doesnt pretend around his art. What he really is - unmistakable, flawless, physical, and dead on with his singing - a remarkable talent showcased like a diamond in this PBS special. From the opening shots of the theatre interior, through a remarkable concert to the closing frame, nothing's amiss. The essence is all-powerful, and nothing extra is needed. Buble's apparently smart enough to know what matters, because everything about his show is given to serve a MUSICAL art, we're the luckiest for that! MUSICAL integrity makes the theatrical aspects of his stagecraft an accompaniment, and enticing. It's a refreshing feeling, for a change. From all the willing references in his style, he ends with a completely original product.  His version of Try A Little Tenderness is alone worth the price of this dvd/concert audio pkg. He resurrects the narcotic tune Sway with abandon. His youth works for him, he's modern, and daring as hell. Buble's a singer (finally!) who trusts his voice through and through, and it lets a great simplicity sparkle. I'm an older chap and wouldnt expect to dig this guy's art this much, but I do, and you will too. It's an extraordinary concert from a glowing, knowing MUSICIAN. What more to ask?

June Carter was the angel that probably saved his life and made him famous so why not dig and little deeper into their marriage. Come on HOLLYWOOD! He gave much more to entertainment than this movie leads one to believe. Why not start with the beginning and end with the respectable life he led instead of just the beginning of his career. Can't believe his son, John Carter Cash would let people by with this one! Nothing to make one want to see it twice!

B00003CXD5|5.0|I remember seeing this film on TV many times when I was a youngster and it always impressed me.  Now, in the context of all the films that have come and gone since, it's even more impressive.  It's the never-ending story of the struggle for your dreams, greed, retribution and redemption, all expertly played out by a perfect cast.  The film restoration is first class and the accompanying documentaries, insights, etc. are really fascinating.  Watch all those first and your viewing experience will be all the better.

B000E1ZBGS|4.0|Upon first viewing of the film, I thought the scenery was lovely and the soundtrack was amazing.  Jean-Yves makes us all wish we had practiced the piano like our parents advised.  The problem I had with the film was the complete lack of subtlety.  For instance, the Bennets are uber-rural in this version.  I didn't need to see a parading pig's backside and undercarriage to get that.  Little things, like the clap of thunder when Darcy oversteps his critique of the Bennets by adding Lizzie's dad into the mix, were like unnecessary punctuation marks. Talk all you want about Mrs. Bennet and the three younger sisters, but face the wrath of mother nature when you diss a girl's dad.  Other annoyances: Lizzie must be as free as the blackbird, who's forever warbling in the distance.  She's dark and mysterious and wild, with plenty of dark frocks and contoured eye makeup.  Got it.  Didn't need the constant face time that was spent zooming in on Keira Knightley's dark eyes and pursed lips.  Don't even get me started with the obsessive attention to her jawline.  And Mr. Darcy is more s-s-s-socially in-n-n-ept as opposed to morally superior in this current release.  Matthew Macfayden excels at dark, dishy, and intense.  He didn't need to stumble on his words to emphasize Darcy's vulnerabilities or to make us like Darcy more.  Darcy is supposed to be a pompous jerk, who is seldom checked by others and changes only when he meets his match in Elizabeth.  So much of this film feels spoon fed and dumbed down.  I wish I could get past these things to enjoy the lovely locations and the superb acting.  However, the ending was so silly, with its paperback, bodice-ripper vibe, that it cannot be ignored.  The \\"swans at night\\" made me think of that beer commercial that spoofs the old chocolate ad, you know the one with guy sampling the foam off the woman's face?.  The actors seemed to struggle to get through the ending without laughing at the absurdity of what they were saying.  That shouldwon them an award.  \\"Goddess divine\\"?   \\"My pearl\\"?  Blech!  To tack that on was poor judgment, even if it were to appease the American audience.  I recommend stopping the film before you get to this part.  If you're better at overlooking these flaws, then you will enjoy the other parts of the film.  If anything, it ill make you want to take up the piano forte.
B000000OQF|5.0|After listening to \\"Appetite\\" for the umpteenth time I am confident in saying that had the Gunners stayed together they would've been my generation's Led Zeppelin.  Some may scoff at the comparison, but they were so good in their prime that I could easily envision it.

B000B8QEZG|2.0|Am I the only one here who thinks that Madonna is a hack with absolutely no talent and an ego the size of Jupiter?!<br /><br />I listened to this album because my friend requested me to pick out some good songs for her wedding reception party (!!)<br /><br />I went through the entire album and found myself bobbing my head to the amazing beats [who unlike Madonna actually HAVE talent and produce absolutely awesome stuff].  I loved the songs....that is, until Miss Diva started singing.<br /><br />I'm sorry-I don't mean this to sound like a rant but frankly I'm so tired of people telling me that Madonna is some sort of musical genius because she really isn't.  I guarantee you that if you are looking for insightful lyrics or complexity...this is definetely not the album for you.  However if you're looking for something light and something that you can maybe sorta dance to [some of the songs are really weird to dance to in my opinion], then buy this album.<br /><br />A classic it is not.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought the series because I saw the movie (Serenity) and liked it and wanted to understand it better.  Even if you are not a sci-fi or a western fan, you will love this series.  There is something compelling about it - I don't know exactly what it is - maybe the actors and the way they portray their characters, or the characters who don't fit any of the usual stereotypes - but it draws you in.  The series exceeded all expectations.  I'm so disappointed that it was cancelled after so few episodes with so many questions remaining.  I was even more disappointed to discover that I can't even buy books to get more of the story and characters.  The music is beautiful, yet a soundtrack for the series is not available.  The only regret you'll have if you buy this DVD set is that there aren't more episodes to watch.
B000066F6H|4.0|i love the Hives.  This album is so fast and loud and not like anything else around today, i don't understand how you could not like it.  Sure Howlin' Pelle is a bit hard to understand, but he's so high energy and amazing! if you like music, you definetly need to own this CD
B000002KBD|5.0|These reviews are always messy because the people that write them tend to be either extremely for or against whatever it is they are reviewing.  I will do nothing to combat this.<br /><br />This album's five star rating is justified.  Great opening track with \\"Domino,\\" but it's not the best.  \\"Virgo Clowns\\" is hauntingly beautiful (pardon the cliche), especially when Dahaud Elias Shaar comes in on his bass clarinet.  The next track, \\"Gypsy Queen,\\" is another R&B winner all the way.<br /><br />I read the _Rolling Stone's_ review of this album, and it was accused of being _too_ perfect--too much goodness on one album, like _Moondance_.  That's a  good point.<br /><br />Anything else I say would just be repeating everyone else, so just read some reviews, listen to the samples, and make your own decision.  Chances are you're predisposed to like Van Morrison if you're already here anyway, which further suggests that you're likely to buy the album, or at least have a struggle of whether or not to pay 13 bucks for it.  I'd advise you to take the plunge, but it's up to you.

B000E97Y6K|4.0|The issue with a 3hr remake of a 2hr film is that with nothing new to say, what holds the attention of the audience? Watching the film I was dumbstruck watching the special effects and irritatingly looking for flaws (I couldn't help it.) I didn't want to, but I kept doing it anyway. The entire film is one big special effect and for some reason it doesn't bother me in Star Wars or LOTR, it bugged me here.<br /><br />I also loved and hated the homage to the original, while it was nice, it was distracting to hear the old dialogue verbatim (as part of the film within the film.) I just remembered more and more how I already new what was going to happen.<br /><br />In the end just like I got tired of watching the hobbits bounce on the shoulders of the tree ent in \\"the two towers\\" so here I got very tired of one shot after the next of Watts in Kong's mechanical hand bouncing around before a green screen.<br /><br />The first and last hours (in New York) are the best, the island part is tedious action and you really decide at this point that Blacks Character has no redeeming qualities (I keep wishing Kong would step on him) as he sacrifices life after life for a movie he never makes. And why? WHY??? Would you display Kong in an theater in Manhattan? It Makes no sense!!! He could take Kong into the middle of Kansas and people by the tens of thousands would drive to see it. What, what where the penguin suits and gowns in the audience supposed to do for the rest of the two hours after the initial shock of looking at a great, giant gorilla wore off? I was dumb struck by that in both films.<br /><br />Finally, when Kong and Watts are \\"together\\" on screen the film works. All the action and dialogue is filler to get them together and let the emotional roller coaster begin. Those scenes save the film and Andy Serkis deserves and Academy Award, damnit.<br /><br />A leaner, tighter film with less about everything but the gorilla and the girl would have been perfect, this is merely good.merely good. <br />
B00005JL2O|4.0|This is my first exposure to Mike Myers and his Austin Powers character and while some of the gags just don't work, the movie is a funny one.  Myers is hilarious as the many characters he plays, and although some of his humor is too flatulent oriented, I have to admit I laughed every time.  Beyonce Knowles is throwaway material but she's effective.  Verne Troyer is a hoot as Mini Me and Seth Green is fun as Dr. Evil's son.  Add a cast of celebrity cameos, especially those in the scene's AUSTINPUSSY opening and you can't help but fall into the movie's maniacal thrust.  Full of fun music from the seventies and some outrageous costuming and dialogue, GOLDMEMBER is fun to watch.

B00005N5RM|4.0|I think Criterion messed up when they restored the original 1958 version of THE BLOB. The 1988 version is the one they should have released instead! Following the basic story from the original, the remake has better acting, better special effects, Shawnee Smith in a cheerleader outfit, Kevin Dillon strutting, a smart script and most importantly: it's a lot of fun.<br /><br />After a highly entertaining introduction to the main players, an object from outer space crashes down in a field near a hobo's shack. The hobo goes to investigate and ends up with blob goo wrapped around his hand. Some local teenagers take him to a hospital and that's when all Hell breaks loose. Before you can say \\"Hockey season ended months ago.\\" the blob has grown bigger than Rosie O'Donnell's skull and starts killing everybody in town. Not to worry though, because Kevin Dillon and his trusty motorcycle are here to save the day...except for the few dozen people who get killed by the blob including some really awesome kills like a dude pulled down a sink drain and a woman crushed inside a phone booth.<br /><br />Everything that was awesome about 50's creature feature movies is in this movie and then amplified with pure 80's cheese. It's a blast! The only thing that could have made it better (besides a bigger boss fight at the end) is if it'd been set in a college town and the blob invades a party where a bunch of hot naked chicks are running around topless.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am not exactly a Sci-fi junky, although I am a Joss Whedon fan, and I thoroughly enjoyed the Firefly box set.  I highly recommend the series for anyone looking for something a little different. <br /> <br />I wish that Joss would have had more time and funding to continue with this series the way that he would have wanted.
B00004VVNB|2.0|Tripe. Really really bad.  I had never seen it before but based on the reviews I figured it would be perfect along side the other classics I love.. Blade Runner, Tron and THX1138... it turned out to be quite mediocre. <br /> <br />avoid.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Great DVD.  The Firefly series and Serenity are excellent examples of how good sci-fi sometimes falls through the mainstream cracks. <br /> <br />I can't say enough good things about how great plot line that Joss created.  You will throughly enjoy the release!  And you have to puck up the Firefly box set!

B00005U122|4.0|I'm a Floyd fan, having seen both Floyd (w/o Waters) and Waters solo.  I was a little skeptical about this DVD until I read some positive reviews here, and decided to try it.  I am glad I did.  The sound is terrific, the video is terrifc, and there are some choice selections, like \\"Dogs\\" off Animals.  Roger seems at ease as a frontman, and the assembled musicians are good.  If there is a downside, it's the limited number of solo Waters tunes, but if you are primarily interested in the Floyd tracks, you'll enjoy this.
0670813028|5.0|If there ever was a book the described my summer as a teen - this was it.<br /><br />My first really scary book.<br /><br />Reading about kids younger than I was fighting bullies, abusive parents, school angst and a shape shifting monster all at the same time was inspiring.<br /><br />The tones of childhood resonating in each flashback section thrilled me with the passion with which each action and rite of childhood was illustrated and vividly recreated.  These were people with which I could easily gel.<br /><br />The trails and passage of these kids and the horrible way in which they are driven...<br /><br />Stll a remarkable read after all these years.

B000055XMF|4.0|i bought this move because i thought it sounded like a tight movie, not because i'm a Who fan.  I was glad to see that The Who weren't actually in the movie all that much!  But instead, Sting is in it for a few scenes.  Now i'm glad i got it because its a pretty dope movie!<br /><br />Leanard Part Six
B0001I55SS|5.0|Enjoyed it years and years ago.  Glad to have it back again..
B0000549B0|5.0|A more whimsical movie would be hard to imagine, and it's a wonderful treat. James Stewart is Elwood P. Dowd, a man who hits the sauce and has foresaken reality, and who has an invisible 6-foot rabbit (a pooka) as his constant companion (his name is Harvey and we never see him, either). The \\"point\\" of the movie is summed up by Stewart: \\"My mother told me, 'In this world you have to be one of two things - smart or pleasant.' I've opted for pleasant.\\" And pleasant he is: he's kind to everyone and everyone's his friend. His sister (Josephine Hull) tries to have him institutionalized, with disastrous/funny results.<br /><br />There are many great scenes, beginning with the opening one: Stewart comes out of his house and is presented with a telegram by a Western Union man. He thanks the messenger profusely - and then tears up the telegram without even looking at it. Ah, to be so carefree! One is reminded for a brief second of the Marx Brothers and their brand of anarchy, but here it's just quiet, relatively harmless, madness and not a revolt. The ending is a little forced, but the movie is totally enjoyable. Definitely worth a watch.
B00079FUI6|5.0|Many of the series are predominantly meant for women, this one can be watched by men as well in my opinion. Although framed with surprises after surprises the scenes allow many to identify within some of the main actors therefore much more down to reality compared to other series. I liked it and I think what keeps it interesting is that the script continues with an original path, so it doesn't become boring. I've seen it also translated into other languages then English and yet it's very nice, it doesn't loose appeal at all. My suggestion is not to loose the chance to have a copy.
0679735259|1.0|This book is tortorous to read. I'm reading it for a class i currently have and i have to say i'm probably never going to pick it up agian. the whole book is like one big run on sentence with small breaks now and then. its got no order, i feel like it jumps around. not a good read. I'd discourage anyone from buying it. unless you like run on sentences.
B000063Y8F|5.0|Works excellent when used as directed. Nice looking and substantially constructed. Cleans up easily and has no parts to get lost or fall off.
B000002J09|5.0|ZOSO. I don't know what the hell it means, but I own this album and I can tell you ZOSO should stand for greatness. That's what this album is, GREAT. The opening track to ZOSO is \\"Black Dog\\". It is a great opening track on which I believe that the screeching Robert Plant was at his best. Hell, Plant is the greatest leadsinger ever and this cd was his all-time greatest. In fact every member of the band was at their greatest. I've never heard a better guitar solo than Jimmy Page on the most played song in the history of radio, \\"Stairway to Heaven\\". John Paul Jones string arrangments and bass playing were nothing short of spectacular. And John Bonham's greatness can be heard on the tracks \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" and \\"Rock and Roll\\". His thundering drum playing made those particular tracks great. This is the second greatess album ever made(behind \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\"). This album is highly recomended.
B000CBSHK2|3.0|I love Beth Orton but her songs were much more interesting when she collaborated with electronic producers like she did on her first disc. I wish she would work with the Chemical Brothers again. They made a great team!  <br /> <br />That being said, I like the first half of the disc much better than the second half. It gets a little depressing and boring towards the end of the disc. It is still better than most discs out there.
B00006879E|5.0|I purchased this album after discovering that two very diverse songs which I had heard on the radio and liked, \\"Harder to Breathe\\" and \\"She Will Be Loved,\\" were both sung by Maroon 5.  Whereas the former is rough and modern, the latter is sweetly soulful.  The band's eclectic style permeates the entire album, from the pop-like \\"This Love\\" to the more jazzy \\"Sunday Morning,\\" there is something here to suit virtually every music lover's tastes.  Every track on SONGS ABOUT JANE is devoted to lead singer Adam Levin's mysterious muse, Jane.  His conflicting emotions about the source of his inspiration are evident in his often-contradictory lyrics:  \\"I'll never leave you behind-Or treat you unkind\\" (from \\"Sweetest Goodbye\\"); \\"There is nothing you can say or do-I called to let you know I'm through with you\\" (from \\"Through With You\\"); and \\"I'm full of regret-For all things that I've done and said\\" (from \\"Tangled\\").  These words speak deeply to anyone who has ever been in love, with all of its glory, all of its misery.  If you are looking for music that is fresh, different, and familiar all at the same time, I highly recommend the unique sound of Maroon 5.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I'm a big Firefly fan--not a fanatical one, but I really found this show extremely entertaining. The writing and acting were top-notch in both tv show and film. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good comedy-drama with fun characters. I also highly recommend the Firefly DVD set. Anyone who doesn't watch these shows is really missing out!
B000244FDW|5.0|I am such a fan of Pride and Prejudice!  I adore the A&E version, which cannot be topped in my opinion, as well as the old black and white and the \\"Bollywood\\" version, Bride and Prejudice.  I purchased this DVD and enjoyed it very much.  I have several of the old classics done in the 80's by the British, and have yet to be dissappointed.
B0000A1RJI|2.0|The song is good but I would just buy a single off of the internet and not this whole CD.
1573301183|5.0|The Alice In Chains MTV Unplugged performance was a real treat to behold, especially considering that Layne Staley's drug issues had kept the band from touring regularly for some time. Unfortunately, this show is one of the last ones that the group would play, and as a result the documentation is all the more valuable and essential. My only real issue with the set list is that they play no songs from the band's debut Facelift album. If I remember correctly, the whole concept of the MTV Unplugged series was to take musicians whose majority of work was within an electric/synthetic framework and transpose the music into an acoustic setting. Granted the performances on this DVD are spectacular, and I really could not imagine an AIC unplugged venue without having classics like 'Nutshell' and 'Brother' covered. But those tunes were recorded as acoustic numbers, so they really don't get the treatment of a change of venue. Now the Facelift songs on the other hand were all heavy, electric-drenched numbers which would have been very interesting to hear in an acoustic setting. I think that the whole concept of the show is that you take a large sounding electric piece and transform it via acoustic instruments. AIC had a perfect opportunity to do this with at least 1 or 2 Facelift tunes, but decided to pass. This is disappointing, especially in light of the fact that every other AIC album is represented here. But this aside, the DVD is excellent and serves as a wonderful document to one of the best bands of the 1990s.

B000COQCTM|5.0|As a child I used to weep when reading this book. I felt so sad that a pig becomes humen food. The straight forward acceptance of death made me afraid to die. As an adult I read the book to my children and realize they need to accept the fact that we use animals for bacon and ham. Some fear it is cruel and turn into vegetarians.<br /><br />As for death, it is inevitble we have to accept it. We need to value our friendship and make most of ourselves. Life does not go on forever. Our friendship with others will.
B000000W8C|5.0|What can be said for the verves best lp,..I was watching a bad movie on cable one night, and i heard a song in this movie, at some LA party type setting, it was \\"Slide away\\". Probable the most known song from their first LP. That song cought my attention, looked in the credits got the name and sought them out. Bought \\"A storm in heaven\\". Liked the cd alot, loved slide away, but I was unsure of there longevity. Kinda forgot about them untell I found out there where coming to town to play. Bought a ticket (even if your not a big fan of a group from over seas, never know if you will ever get another chance to see them live again) It was the \\"Norther soul\\" tour. I had bought a norther soul cd already and loved it! One raido staion was playing \\"History\\" off this album. It was a sami big hit for the band. The album instantly became one of my faviorte cd's (out of 300). Finally a band that will withstand the test of time! So i thought....every song on the album has a feel all its own.                                                                  History- synphony background loop with great lyics very smooth.                                     <br />Drive you home- folk rock but very powerfull sounding.  <br />So it goes- a blue eyed soul song.  <br />Brimstom Interlude- psychedelic rock. <br />A new decade- rock. <br />A northern soul- psychedelic rock hypnotic gitar. <br />This is only 6 songs that are just awsome. Not a stinker in the bunch on this cd IMHO. If u listin to this album twice you will be hooked...Only if u like good music. <br />Sadly to say the band is broken up and Richard Ashcroft is doing his solo thing. From what I heard is that the synphony loop they used in the back ground of \\"Bitter sweet synphony\\" was a track off a stones album. It ended with the stones winning a copyright infringement lawsuit and the rights for the song....          <br />I was fortunet enough to see this timeless band twice! I have 4 verve cd's and 2 Ashcroft cd's. Just  to let u know im a fan of this band. (could ya tell?)
B000ASATZ8|3.0|The first Tremors has always been a family favorite.  It's funny, somewhat clever, and just plain entertaining.  Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward have great chemistry, and they are the single reason the movie is any good.  We had trouble finding Tremors 2, which is why I bought the box set.  Not as good as the first, but still pretty entertaining.  No Kevin Bacon, but Fred Ward stars.  Tremors 3 is not as good as 2, and I slept through Tremors 4.  No Bacon or Ward in either of the final 2.
B000021YQV|4.0|Being a virign lister to this group with my only expouse to them via the trio of songs \\"Chop Suey!\\", \\"Toxicity\\", and the every pouplar \\"Aerials\\"(that might be the only System of Down song that would be played in Super markets) that would get the raido time, suggest to me that this group was a little ruff around the edges, but basicly a mello group. Boy, was wrong about this group, for they are hard metal group, and at first I was a little upset about that, but after a repeated listening to the CD, I found out that I like it, for all of the political and social issues that are covered in this CD, after getting a good gist of what they were saying.  <br /> <br />Another thing what I like about this group is how some of their songs sound like they are totally disorganized, like a little bit over there, a little bit over here, and something here are put together in a bleder, spin around for a couple of seconds, after that they are spit out. But I think that is down on puprose, and to top that all of are two singers, Daron Malakian and Serj Tankian have some of most unquie sounding voices that I have ever heard.  <br /> <br />As I said before, if you are new this group and the only expouse that you have to this group is what played on the radio, then I suggest that you get this CD.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a damn good show and a must have for all SciFi fans! The complete series comes in 4 single cases and a large case to hold all so there is no fooling around w/ filp open case like w/ other series.
B000E1155E|1.0|This is a bad album, poorly conceived, not thought out, and a blatant copy of good musicians like Jack White.  If you get all your new music from the radio, hipster magazines, or indie pop websites, then you might like this band. If you actually have musical taste (or talent), you will likely be offended at how crappy this retread album is.  I give it negative one star for being embarassingly bad, insultingly derivative, and nothing more than young brits (who can barely play their instruments) getting famous for rehashing all the indie pop garbage of the last 2 years.  Hey, maybe my no-talent \\"wouldn't-be-famous-if-they-weren't-handsome\\" garbage is exactly what you're looking for.  I suspect that since this band is so hip right now, everyone will pile on and say I'm nuts.  Maybe I am....but I have to suspect that the other reviewers work for (or ARE) the Arctic Monkeys.
0553378384|5.0|As another reviewer wrote earlier, he/she felt compelled to write a review for the first time because of this book's impact.  I had used astrology, among other things, as a tool for self-understanding for years, picking apart my birth chart, before coming across this book and being exposed to the influence of the 'nodes of the moon' for the first time.  For those who might normally poo-poo astrology, any fear of \\"astro-jargon\\" and superficial description quickly fades with the startling insightfulness of this inspired work.  A friend, who had no experience with astrology beyond reading about her sun sign in the newspaper, borrowed the book, studied her node's profile, referencing it again and again, until I had to ask for her to return it. <br /> <br />I suppose people come upon this book when they've realized their existence is beyond just this lifetime, and they are really ready to work on their 'karma,' and deal with the themes that are  really 'running' them in this lifetime.  This is why I started studying astrology in the first place; this is the kind of insight I was looking for when I chose to pursue a psychology degree in college, as I tried to \\"figure myself out.\\"  I have read many, many books over the years from a variety of fields in my quest.  This is one of the few dog-eared books on my shelf, that I've returned to again and again, always being made more and more aware of myself in pondering the amazingly rich descriptions of my nodal sign and house position. <br />
B000E6UK5K|3.0|it is a very quiet album. i was waiting for some explosion of sound. it was kind of like elevator music. i would play this album in a nursery to sooth little children. i saw pink floyd at foxboro and it was the best concert ever.  if he plays this album live they better have coffee available.
B000069CWE|5.0|This album is good. Good, but not great. Nearly every song on this album I prefer less than the original.  <br /> <br />1) Opening - Beautiful. Awesome violins. Intro to \\"Krwling\\". <br />2) Pts. Of Athrty - Okay. I loved it the first time I heard it, but it's BORING. <br />3) Ente E ND - WTF?! Crap. Absolute crap. The meaning of \\"In the End\\" has been washed away, and transformed into some street-rap garbage. It is kinda catchy, though.  <br />4) Chali - Some phone call. Not even worth reviewing.  <br />5) FRGT/10 - It's good. It's catchy, but \\"Forgottan\\" had such amazing lyrics and singing/rapping. This remix features some rapper who's voice totally contradicts Mike and Chester. It's mainly a rap song. The lyrics have changed, so they aren't as wonderful and creative as \\"Forgottan\\". <br />6) P5hng Me A*wy - Awesome. For once, the featured person is NOT a rapper (He is, in fact, Taproot's lead singer). It is still as beautiful as \\"Pushing Me Away\\", but I still prefer the original song. It was more... simplistic? Though this song is great, the effects are a little annoying after a while, making it hard to listen to. The lyrics are probably even greater in the remix than the original. <br />7) PLC. 4 Mie Haed - Great! \\"Place for my head\\" is one of my absolute favorite Linkin Park songs. Mike's rapping isn't as captivating, and Chester's voice is practically background music. The featured rapper is absolutely DREADFUL! He changed the lyrics so that the words mean the same things, yet sound stupid. \\"Find another place to feed your greed\\" turns into \\"Find another place to feed your face\\".  <br />8) X-Ecutioner Style - Catchy. Very catchy. I never skip it. This isn't much of Linkin Park, though, and there isn't much to comment on.  <br />9) H! Vltg3 - Whoa. This SUCKS! The original \\"High Voltage\\" was dramatic, scary, and emotional. The only thing changed here is the music. Now there's some crappy piano in the background plucking the same note over and over and over... <br/>10) Riff-Raff - Crap. <br />11) WTH>You - HOLY CRAP! I totally love this remix! Sure, Mike's rapping isn't as beautiful as it was, but it's still great! For once, the featured rapper doesn't totally screw things up. In fact, he strengthens it! The lyrics are great, and very emotional. I love it as much as the original \\"With You\\", which is my favorite Linkin Park song.  <br />12) NTR/Mssion - Some piano. Nothing special. <br />13) PPR: Kut - Whoa. This is awesome! Very emotional, and Mike's rapping is such as awesome. The featured rapper isn't exactly terrible, but not good. The lyrics make it seem more mainstream. <br />14) Rnw@Y - Awesome! The original \\"Runaway\\" was pretty good, and this gets the same rating. Awesome listen. <br />15) My&lt;DSMBR - My favorite. Lots of people tell me they hate it, but somehow I love it. It's even sadder than \\"My December\\", and the background noise/music enchants me. I repeat: I totally love it.  <br />16) Stef - Uh... <br />17) By_myslf - Cool! I prefer \\"By Myself\\", but this remix is awesome. It gives off the same helplessness, and is insanly catchy. Awesome. <br />18) Kyr4 TH Ich - Great techno song. It doesn't seem to have much to do with \\"Cure for the Itch\\", though. Probably because of it's lack for lyrics and vocals. It has some \\"Step Up\\" in it. Very catchy. <br />19) 1stp Klosr - Very mysterious. It's very eerie in the beginning, and heavy at the end. I NEVER skip it.  <br />20) KRWLG - Beautiful. It's even sadder than \\"Crawling\\", and very emotional. Most of it isn't even vocals, which I think is brilliant. This song is AMAZING. It definetly does \\"Crawling\\" justice.  <br /> <br />
B0000073I5|4.0|SMALLCREEP'S DAY is kind of an odd &#34;solo album&#34; because the main artist is showcased as a songwriter but not so much as a performer.  Performance-wise, there is more focus on singer Noel McCalla and keyboardist Anthony Phillips than on Rutherford. (Mr. Mike particularly does little actual playing on some sections of the &#34;Smallcreep's Day&#34; suite.)  This is an album that doesn't quite sound like anything else, particulary Rutherford's later efforts.  I wouldn't have minded hearing this combination of performers do more. (They also did a rare B-side, &#34;Compression&#34;, whose failure to appear on this CD as a bonus track is a CRIME.)  Compositionally, Rutherford goes for beauty and complexity over memorability. One thing that has always stood out to me is the album's sweet, uncynical personality -- quite a contrast to, say, the melancholy atmosphere of Tony Banks' comparable A CURIOUS FEELING or to most Gabriel-era Genesis. Comparisons between the &#34;Smallcreep's Day&#34; suite and Genesis' earlier &#34;Supper's Ready&#34; are both obvious and pointless. (By the way, the &#34;Smallcreep's Day&#34; suite is loosely based on the book of the same name, but its mellow and happy tone departs so drastically from the book's harsh and bitter one that it's ultimately not even telling the same story.)  My favorite track is &#34;Overnight Job&#34;. Some of the lyrics are a bit limp, and &#34;Moonshine&#34; wants to be a much tougher song than it is, but those are minor complaints.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|VERY STRONG CARACTER DEVELOPMENT. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE DONE LIKE THEY ARE USING A HAND HELD CAMERA.

6305609705|5.0|Probably the two best films about that misunderstood painful part of America's history is Apocalypse and Full Metal Jacket. And even they may spend too much time evaluating the ancient conflict between the Pharaoh and the Jews (good and evil) instead of pride and punishment.<br /><br />I admire even more the quote from Tennyson about his son's death at the Somme, \\"when they ask you why they died tell them because their fathers lied.\\" Along with Macnamara and Nixon and Kissenger and the Generals and Johnson and Kennedy.<br /><br />The simplicity of that observation is, I feel, the more interesting quest but also may be the least lucrative. I wonder sometimes when we made the movies about Vietnam and saw them and talked about them and saw them again, were we in search of a true vision of the conflict or were we in search of what might be a better product to market, the war having been over and done with and now only a sad memory in the minds of those who lost sons and daughters, and a still fertile battleground to contemplate the 'whys' in the heads of its survivors.<br /><br />Because with a sports mentality for keeping statistics about Vietnam, the one that sticks in my mind forever is that 'never in the history of war have more survivors committed suicide than those that were killed in the war.' Kind of catches in your throat, doesn't it?<br /><br />The great thing about Captain Willard's (Martin Sheen, maybe at his best) mission (the ceiling fan still geeks me) is that it does encourage the journey into duplicity. Good wars; Bad wars; good drugs; bad drugs; remorseful convicted defendants; unremorseful convicted defendants, who decides?<br /><br />Ditto Brando and Duvall and the excellent cast in their supporting roles. This is an extraordinary movie and somewhere, it should be required reading (observing) for classes in high school. It probably is less of a movie about war than truly a visit to the Heart of Darkness.<br /><br />The best thing about Apocalypse that jumps right there in your face, is that it is so disturbing. That's how I think we should feel. And I have to say that for myself, superficially a semi-successful teacher, a pretty good father and uncle and grandfather, older, not prone to bouts of melancholia or abusiveness, having spent my tour in Hue Phubai, my one recollection that stands out in front of all the rest is that. It disturbs me. Still. 5 stars. Larry Scantleburyt Apocalypse that jumps right there in your face, is that it is so disturbing. That's how I think we should feel.

B000E97Y6K|5.0|I see complaints that this movie was to long.I think it's great that it was long.As a matter of fact i wish it was a little longer so more detail would be shown.Like the extended lord of the rings movies show alot more footage which helps explain more of what's going on.Everyone that went to see this movie new ahead of time how long the show was. So if you don't like watching long movies don't go so you can complain about it later and ruin it for others that do.The movie industry will see your complaints and start shortening the films to the point they make no sense and look chopped up.So for now on look for the feature length and if it's to long don't go or watch something else.Other than that the movie was great.I love the fact this movie has been moderinized.Now i will collect it as i wouldn't buy the original for it was to primative for todays special effects.I love it.
0375831002|5.0|During World War II near Munich, Germany, nine years old Liesel Meminger finds a tome The Gravedigger's Handbook while attending her younger brother's funeral.  Unable to resist she takes the book with her.  However, she is unable to read the book until fate steps in.  Her father is missing and her mother cannot afford her upkeep so she gives Liesel in care to foster parents, acerbic Rosa Hubermann and her kindhearted spouse Hans, who owes a Jew his life.<br /><br />Hans helps Liesel cope with her nightmares and teaches his ward to read.  His chance to pay the war debt to the Jewish soldier who saved his life finally occurs when the man's son, the artist Max, arrives at his house seeking shelter.  As Max paints over pages of the Mein Kampf, Leisel steals books from Nazi burnings and begins to write about living at a time of misery caused by fellow humans.  If the Nazis catch either one, Death will be a welcome guest.<br /><br />This is a complex book in which the  narrator Death tells the tale of Liesel and Max.  Interestingly Death is a cynic when it comes to human behavior especially kindness towards others;  the apparition recognizes that his best suppliers of goods are people who in spite of their Golden Rule ramble contain homicidal tendencies rationalized by an ism of some sort.  The fascinating asides to the readers are brilliant as they enable the audience to understand the cast he looks upon adding to his collection, but especially Death itself.  Give yourself plenty of time, over a week or more, as Markus Zusak has written one of the most haunting tales of the human condition in several years.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B00007GZQZ|5.0|Tom Hanks is as funny & whity as ever.  Every home owner will especially get a kick out of this movie.  When Tom Hanks and his girlfriend (Shelly Long)  purchase a beautiful house at an incredible price it almost seems too good to be true, until the stair case colapses and many more home improvement projects arise and it it will have you rolling on the ground with laughter.  I highly recomend it.
B00005JOFO|5.0|My title gives you a hint of what you will feel after seeing this movie for the first time-and a few days later. Watch it again and you will notice things you didn't see the first time-and feel it for days after. I come from a place where there is understanding and I am allowed to be happy, but this was not so for our young lovers in the country in the 60's (and probably today as well). Enis and Jack had the love of a lifetime but never got to live a life together. This story of love (yes they are gay and cowboys-BUT it is a love story) will leave you aching for them long after you turn the \\"off\\" switch to your dvd player. Please watch this film and tell me you don't feel anything for these two. I do feel cheated that the Academy didn't feel it was the best film of 2005, but I will take the other 65 organizations that say it was (including the Hollywood Foreign Press, DGA, PGA, WGA and so on) and know this film will go down as one of the greatest ever-AFI will have it on the list someday. Again, please watch it and cherish those you love and rejoice in the fact you can be with them. Thank you.

037582913X|5.0|This book is so fun! I have many memories of my dad reading it to me, and using his Grover voice to make it even better. My only down side is that it is not the same size or cover as the one I had as a kid. I could not find it anywhere. But this is still a wonderful buy! I made a puppet to use in my class...enjoy!!
0060516402|4.0|The book is good for those looking at the big picture of company management - but it also applies to smaller teams or personal goals.  I have not read widely in this field, but I found the book easy to read and fairly entertaining.

Blue Racer: This hypocrite doesn't even write her own songs(like the awful title cut, Lucky and Stronger which are all worse than being chased by a crane), they were penned by a Swedish meatball named Max Martin and the results are bubble gum at it worst. Japanese Beetle: Worse of all is her sacrilegous cover of The Rolling Stones' masterpiece Satisfaction and for that HAASAH(chops Britney's head off). Blue Racer: One good this was this record sold less than her debut with only 10 million sold in America. Japanese Beetle: That proved that Britney's career was starting to slide and those who break big with 10 million plus selling debut are doomed, SAYONARA!

Blue Racer: One good thing was this record sold less than her two previous released with only 4.5 million sold in America despite a #1 US debut holding the great Pink Floyd off #1. Japanese Beetle: The falling sales proved that Britney's career was still unraveling when it was revealed that she smokes, drinks, parties and treats fans like trash. that proves lying to save face and trying to change makes you a joke, SAYONARA!

Blue Racer: This hypocrite who didn't get the fact that people were sick of her apparently came back for a fourth go around with In the Zone or In the Twilight Zone. Japanese Beetle: She flopped with third record, a flop movie, a flop restaurant and her real persona came out in the press and wanted a break yet stayed in press with scandals ranging from stealing other women's men to partying with Fred Durst and so on. Lest not forget her kiss with the old prune Madonna. Blue Racer: Britney and Madonna's duet Me Against the Music should be called The Ballad of Two Trashy Harlots. The other tracks like Toxic should come with a government warning on the ears, Outrageous and Touch of My Hand claim to be sexual when they are laughable! Japanese Beetle: Worse of all is that ballad Everytime where she sings like a whine and she should have died in the video yet when she comes out laughing, it shows she is SICK, HAASAH(chops Britney's head off). Blue Racer: The best thing was this record became her worst selling album in the US with only 2.9 million sold in America despite a #1 US debut. Japanese Beetle: The falling sales proved that Britney's career completely plummeted when after this record's release she married for kicks to one dude, then stole a piece of trailer park trash(whom she married) from Shar Jackson and faked a knee injury to get out of touring. That proves that her trying to change from teen star into adult star has backfired, SAYONARA!
0380730405|5.0|This is one of the most enjoyable novels, of many, I have ever read.  I read it in one day when I should have been doing other things, but I kept saying just one more chapter, until I reached the end.  I recommend that other readers try (and are prepared) to read the book straight through.  It's rare (for me) to find a novel that's so well written that I just cannot put it down.<br /><br />The plot is terrific and develops quickly (I won't give anything away), the main characters are very well drawn, and the writing style is beautiful.  Given it's age, I thought it might feel dated and remote - not at all - but the reader does have to feel, at least not antagonistic, towards the life-style of the English aristocracy more than fifty years ago.  I had previously read My Cousin Rachel and thought that was so good, and would be difficult to beat, but I think Rebecca wins (by a nose)!<br /><br />Oh, for more novels like this, perhaps Jamaica Inn will prove to be another!

B00006I53S|5.0|I am using this lens with a Canon Digital Rebel XT and it takes excellent pictures.  I wanted something more than the standard kit lens and this was an outstanding choice.  Read all sorts of reviews before purchasing this lens.  Compared it with the 17-85 lens also.  I like the fact that I can using this with either digital or film camera, should I go back to film.  Only had it two months but am very pleased with it.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I LOVED this movie. It impacted me so much, it made me really look at my life and be grateful for the things i have and made me want to live as if there is no day but today. i loved it so much i saw it seven times before it came out (obsessive yes i know and i cried every time i watched it). I can't get the songs out of my head. Now i'm dying to see the stage show! This movie is worth seeing. If you don't want to spen money on it yet rent it from blockbuster or something first to see if you like it. I gaurentee you'll love it.

0060001941|4.0|I have to admit that it took a long time for me to get into the story. If I hadn't enjoyed the film and didn't know the story as well as I did from my grandmother, I probably would have stopped around page 100 or so. The first third of the story is centered around the struggles and the shame of being poor. The second third allows the characters some time to blossom and shows the sacrifices families are willing to make to give the children a better chance. The final third shows the first tenous results of those years of sacrifice and at last the characters come into their own. Of course there are also the themes of life lessons learned, family tragedies, and family joy.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites.  It does an excellent job capturing the essence of the Graphic Novels of Frank Miller, probably because of the close working relationship between Miller and the Director.  When you watch the film it feels like you are reading a comic book where the story relies more on the visual than the dialog to advance the story, and the visuals are truly one of a kind. The film is shot so it matches the story board of the comic book frame by frame down to the smallest detail. While this movie is not for everyone people who like Pulp Fiction and comic books should enjoy it.
1594200440|4.0|Over all it was a good book but the middle third of the story lingers too long in the past. I was most interested in the present day story of the two sisters, their father and the tart he had married. The extensive bits of family history near the end seemed out of place when the present day story was gearing up for one last confrontation.
0838577016|5.0|Don't be deceived by the size of this book--Although it probably weighs more than I do, I have to say that kandel et.al, present the information in a clear, extremely comprehensible manner with a good deal of interesting experiments, clinical studies, and graphs/images to help illustrate the concepts discussed. Although this book is essentially meant for graduate students, it is highly accessible to undergrads and I am tempted to say anyone else, regardless of their science background. The table of contents and the index also principles of neural science a GREAT reference book. This should definately be a companion to any college (or above) level neuroscience course! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B000060OFT|5.0|As a high school teacher, one does very little that the students actually enjoy.  After reading Romeo and Juliet for weeks, we watched this version and the Zeferelli.  All of my students loved it.  Of course, they questioned the use of Shakespearean language in a modern setting, but they got over it!  We can only watch excerpts of the movie because of school rules, but many of them rented it and bought their own copies outside of school.

B000002KOG|5.0|It was 1969 when I saw this on the shelf of the local record shop and, expecting more of what I heard on Buffalo Springfield Again, I snatched it right up. (It was that and more). Quite astonishing it is. The sound is both luminous and dark, the melodies ancient and new, a fusion of folk, rock, classical, country, electric, acoustic, new and old.  <br /> <br />It was the \\"Neil Young vision\\" thing, I thought. (that's until I heard \\"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\\" - another half of the  multiplying vision). A quiet, totally unheralded minor masterpiece, I soon wore my vinyl copy of \\"Neil Young\\" out and had to buy another. Who knew this guy would loom over us for so long and give us so much more? <br /> <br />As a demonstration of how Neil gets into your head, the great just-Neil-and-guitar epic, \\"Last Trip to Tulsa\\" seemed to have been written about a solo road trip I had just made from Oklahoma to Chicago in an old Chevy. I was and am hooked.  <br /> <br />Unrelated, but a great contemporary quote from Captain Beefheart about Neil: \\"If he's so Young, why does he have to Neil?\\" <br /> <br />Oh, by the way, the two country/string instrumentals still are among my favorite Neil tracks.

This is one of those books where after you read it, you feel good about yourself. It's not that hard to get into, trust me if a high school student can get into it and read it in a couple of days i think anyone can. <br />If you do choose to read this book, don't go through it thinking everything you read is true, just read the book for what it is, and maybe you'll learn something along the way.
B00005JOE8|5.0|As a film fan, I have seen too many shabby comic adaptations, and truthfully too many films which only act intelligent, and are indeed not so.  This film dispels both of those commonplaces, and really is one of those films that a fan like me waits for, if only to remind myself why I go to the theatres.    To set-up a basic introduction, first you need to know that this takes place sometime in the future, in the United Kingdom.  The world is very different, as the US is said to be in turmoil, while Great Britain indeed looks very powerful and strong.  Or so says their media, because in the movie's not too distant past Britain was controlled (through elections) by Sullivan (played by John Hurt) who is as much a 1984 Big Brother, as he is a president.  This is why we meet the 'terrorist' V, and Portman's character Evey, who together have both in their own way suffered under Sutler.    Enough plot summary though, as I assure you that this movie will be worth your while.  Because once again, this film is smart and action-packed (thanks Wachowski brothers!); this is indeed too often becoming a rarity.  One more positive note, is that even though the situation is foreign (and not just by nationality), there is some commonality for all to relate to and dig into.  So, what can I say, except see it, like it, love it.      I hope you do.

B000006NPY|4.0|Though the Smashing Pumpkins' first three albums were all basically guitar-laden stadium-rock mislabeled as alternative, there was always a distinctly electronic vibe to the band's music that you could never quite put your finger on, but you sensed was there. \\"Bury Me,\\" from the band's 1991 debut LP, Gish, begins and ends with computer-modified guitar sounds. On their 1993 breakthrough Siamese Dream, tracks such as \\"Rocket\\" and \\"Silverf*ck,\\" added digitized sounds to the band's wall of guitars. 1995's double-set Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness spelled it out more clearly, with the shimmering synth-pop of \\"1979,\\" the collision of industrial and metal that is \\"Love\\" and the vaguely hip-hop sounding \\"Beautiful.\\" But on Adore, the Pumpkins ditch their drummer and their guitars, buy drum machines and synthesizers and plunge full-on into electronic music. It's a bold experiment for a band who, perhaps more than any other in the staunchly anti-muso 90's, kept the flame of sizzling guitar-rock alive, but it works to an extent. \\"To Sheila\\" and \\"Once Upon a Time\\" are beautifully realized acoustic ballads, while \\"Ava Adore,\\" \\"Daphne Descends\\" and \\"Pug\\" are excellent pieces of distant yet sexy post-rock. \\"For Martha\\" continues in the tradition of epic Pumpkin jams while \\"Crestfallen\\" manages to weld all the angst of Siamese Dream to a spare soundscape of piano, drum machine, and a gorgeous two-part vocal. However, the album does lag a bit compared to previous efforts. \\"Perfect\\" tries to be Adore's answer to \\"1979,\\" but fails miserably, while \\"Annie-Dog,\\" \\"The Tale of Dusty Dog and Pistol Pete,\\" and \\"Behold! The Night Mare\\" are all little more than ill-advised piano ephemera. No matter. Adore is still the most beautiful and reflective album of the band's career.

B00001OH7G|5.0|I'd heard about Rory Gallagher for years but had never listened to him before now. This is my first cd of his and it is amazing stuff. I've since been having a crash course in the wonderful recording output Rory had. Rory's playing is easily equal to Clapton and, I think, superior to ol' slowhand. And on slide just as good as the great Duanne Allman.(from what I can tell all Rory lacked was a hit single on the American market but he seems to have been comfortable in the nitch he was in.)     From the first cut this album rocks while still holding true to Rory's blues influences. Rory's strat pulls out those beautiful glassy tones so much a part of the strat sound of the late sixties. (Rory's 1961 strat with most of its 3 tone finish eaten away by the high acid content of Rory's sweat is much a part of its player as SRV's Wife number one or Clapton's Blackie were to their players.) Rory is backed up here by Gerry McAvoy on bass, Lou Martin on keyboards and Rod de'Ath on drums and percussion. The band as a whole is easily the equal of the Allman brothers or Derek and the dominoes. As a live album I'd put this one up there with the Allman's blues rock monument Filmore East album.    Cradle Rock - this album is about as hard hitting as blues rock gets. I'm going to give my impressions of each song and what it brings to mind. Keep in mind this is just off the top of my head. Any comparisons I make (either here or above) are only to give a reference point and are not qualitative comparisons (unless they are I guess).     I Wonder Who - a cover of a Muddy Waters classic (a tune that Rory played wonderfully on Muddy Waters' London Sessions album with the king of the blues himself. There Rory provides the highlight of an otherwise dull album with some sweet slide work.)    Tatood' Lady - is a fairly good pop/blues song, similar in style to what Clapton was doing with Derrek and the Dominoes at about the same time. Lou Martin provides some tasty and very sixties keyboards here (probably why I'm thinking Derek and the Domonioes.)    Too Much Alcohol - George Thorogood would be right at home with this song. I could also picture SRV covering this. I can't think of anyone playing it better than Rory though.    As The Crow Flies - Rory's acoustic number on this album. Some meaty slide work on this little rocker written by Tony Joe White. The execution here is very country blues. Rory throws in a harmonica solo here.    A Million Miles Away - I'm running out of comparisons but if it wasn't for the next song the solo here would be the best on the album. Also another showcase for Lou Martin's keyboards.    Walk On Hot Coals - Easily the best song on the album. This rocker is a guitar tour-de force with a great opening riff. Easily one of the top ten guitar solos ever. This is the song that got me into Rory. Eleven minutes that just burn with blues energy.    Who's That Coming? - nice electric slide number that starts off quoting \\"Don't sit under the apple tree.\\"    Back on my (Stomping Ground) - from an after hours jam session with more of Rory's fine electric slide playing.     Maritime - little surf rock style instrumental fragment to take us out. (for some reason most album databases will bring this up as \\"Just a little bit\\" but the cd names it after an Irish club Rory performed in regularly.)
B000CNDIZE|3.0|You can hear in the track \\"Breathe Me\\" a total copy of Amos in mood, delay, whisper, piano, mix, etc.  Tori is such a great artist that to blatantly copy her music from the mid to late 90's is like someone coming out with an album in the early 70's that sounds blatantly like the Beatles.  It's flat out wrong and nobody should be doing it.  When I first heard the track \\"Breathe Me\\" I truly believed it was Tori Amos.  If you are going to copy someone at least make something good, and she admittedly did make a good track.  This is the most blantant theft of a great sound since Creed stole from Pearl Jam years ago.  The only problem is that Tori Amos is, I believe, the single most creative artist of the 90's next to Trent Reznor.  To steal her sound is blasphemy and Sia should be avoided to discourage this kind of imitation of greatness.  I advise you instead to pick up any of Tori Amos' live cd singles or try out To Venus and back to listen to where Sia stole her music from.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|Pop this CD in your car, head for the country, and watch the movie unfold.  Its the perfect accompaniment at sunset.  It could become the score to your own memorable road trip.  Lush, rapturous arrangements of moving Morricone melodies, beautifully performed and recorded.
B000002TWN|3.0|Nobody would ever accuse D'Angelo of going anywhere in a hurry. Believe me, Brown Sugar owes nothing to the Rolling Stones except the shared title, and while the Stones' song invoked images of sexual enslavement, D'Angelo's version is purely consensual. The title is song is slow and blistering, and it establishes the pace for the entire album. Each song moves at the speed of slow sex, which makes it fairly impressive accompaniment for same. Out of the bedroom, though, this collection can get pretty tedious.<br /><br />Brown Sugar is less a collection of songs than an assemblage of sexy, slow jams with hypnotic, heavy grooves. Each track sits in its own pocket and stays there; chord changes and melody are minimal. In their place is a seductive vibe that holds steady while D'Angelo styles in a free-form falsetto that is more than a little reminiscent of Marvin Gaye. The production is slick and full of space without distracting from the libido-driven topicality of each song. \\"Jonz in My Bonz,\\" \\"Smooth\\" and \\"Higher\\" all convey the full content of their message in the title. Dropped in the middle of this collection is a good cover version of Smokey Robinson's \\"Cruisin',\\" which although good, doesn't offer much to justify the remake. All things being equal, I'd just as soon hear Smokey sing it, but thanks anyway. Brown Sugar works like an aphrodisiac if you're with somebody and the lights are already down low, but if you're alone, it works more like Sominex. B Tom Ryan
6302732778|3.0|I should have kept this movie on tape when i first taped it from Cinemax, I never thought that the director would screw it up by removing the narration form the movie. I wish I had it now, because it's hard to find the original version. I also prefer the happy ending to the new ending. I'm still looking hard for the original version, it should be a collector's item.
B000A3DFZE|4.0|Well, if nothing else, it sure is nice to hear that Eric Clapton is happy. \\"Back Home\\" comes on the heels of a few blues-based album releases - Clapton's real bread and butter - but this somehow sounds more like a traditionally `classic' Clapton album than anything else he's released in years. Indeed, this album sounds very much like any one of his typical `classic-rock' albums from the `70s, which is both good and bad. It's good if you are a bonafide Clapton fan, since it replicates the laid-back style of his mid-70s hits like \\"Lay Down Sally\\" and \\"Wonderful Tonight.\\" It's bad because...well, because it suggests the laid-back era of songs like \\"Lay Down Sally\\" and \\"Wonderful Tonight\\". It even has a requisite mellow reggae track that sounds so unmistakably like mid-`70s Clapton that he ought to patent it. If you were lost in the mountains for the past thirty years, and heard this album upon your return, you would think that nothing musically significant had happened since 1975. If you like that idea (and I can understand why more than a few baby boomers might feel that way), then you will love this disk.<br /><br />\\"Back Home\\" finds Clapton adjusting to his life as a dedicated Dad and husband. He may finally have peace of mind and happiness, but he apparently is not particularly well rested. The ever-so-catchy lead-off track \\"So Tired\\" makes this quite plain, as Clapton bemoans the day to day routine and constant demands that are placed on him, while making it equally obvious that his exhaustion is a small price to pay for the joy of being part of a family. A few tunes here hearken back to the blues (\\"Lost and Found\\", \\"One Day\\") but the main topic here is domesticity and familial love. Most of the disk is quite pleasant, particularly the aforementioned leadoff track, with \\"Say What You Will\\"  \\"Run Home to Me\\" and the closer, \\"Back Home\\" all establishing the mood of a happy family life (and also all written by Clapton, usually with his co-producer, Simon Climie). The best track here, though, is an old Syreeta (Stevie Wonder's ex-wife, now sadly deceased) song called \\"I'm Going Left\\". Clapton performs the song in a style that is very true to the original, and it had me scrambling to find my old \\"Stevie Wonder Presents Syreeta\\" album, now a rarity and an absolute `must own\\" for anyone who appreciates Stevie Wonder. His version of George Harrison's \\"Love Comes to Everyone\\" is equally faithful to the original, but with less transcendent results. Taken as a whole, \\"Back Home\\" isn't a work of genius, but it will satisfy longtime Clapton fans, in more ways than one.

B000001ZS8|2.0|Zoolook~ Jean-Michel Jarre is a case where the artist is way to avant-garde for his own best. After having made amazing albums such as Oxygene, Equinox and Magnetic Fields he unfortunately creates this mess of an album. I find it a bit too much like modern art, i.e., confusing, confounding and impossible to grasp. It also seems like Jarre was a bit over confident when he recorded this album. He had recorded some of the best synth albums of all time and decided to create a total arts album and it just does not work. This is an album that should have stayed unrealesed since it is just to avant-garde and sounds more like an experimental sound session rather then as a well produced album. Very disapointing indeed!
B00092ZMDY|3.0|Back in the `70s, the Eagles latched onto something that seemed very creative at the time. The `country rock' sound that was developed by Gram Parsons and the Byrds in the late `60s got polished to a high-pitched sheen by Glenn Frey, Don Henley, Randy Meisner and Bernie Leadon, eventually abetted by Don Felder on lead guitar. Their first four albums were all crucial to their era, and brought `country-rock' to the forefront of popularity. By the time that they released \\"Hotel California,\\" they were recognized as huge stars, and their creativity reached significantly beyond the standard arrangements of country rock. Then, `punk rock' attempted to change all that. The Eagles dismissed the do-it-yourself aesthetic of punk as a laughable aberration. Instead, they entered the recording studio for what seemed like years, only to emerge in 1979 with the most boring and ill-conceived album of their career, a poorly focused effort that was appropriately entitled \\"The Long Run.\\" Judging by sales figures, the Eagles were right, though. Bands like the Buzzcocks and Stiff Little Fingers languished and then fell apart, while \\"The Long Run\\" went platinum. Still, though, the band recognized that their relevance was diminishing, and they disbanded soon afterward. They haven't released a studio album since then.<br /><br /> Twenty-five years later, the band is touring and drawing crowds as if they had never left. In the interim, a collection of their greatest hits has become the best-selling album of all time, so in reality, they never really did go away. Without any considerable addition to their catalog of tunes, the band has toured sporadically, demanding outrageous ticket prices, and yet continually selling out stadiums around the world. This time around, the tour was mockingly entitled the \\"Farewell 1 Tour\\", and this DVD captures one complete show as performed in Melbourne, Australia. As this audience ascertains, fans of the band now consist of a mixed group of three generations, all of whom seem to think that the year is 1977, and \\"Hotel California\\" is still at the top of the charts. (As a side note, it is rather obvious that for this show at least, the band sent out roadies to ensure that the front row was filled entirely with attractive women, a rather transparent and ridiculous maneuver at this point of the band's career.)<br /><br />The strange thing, though, is that three of the five `original' bandmembers are no longer aboard, and their contributions are unacknowledged here, except for a performance of Meisner's \\"Take It to the Limit\\". Joe Walsh has been an Eagle for the last two albums only, and Timothy B. Shmit didn't join until the sessions for their last album, yet they now consist of 50% of the `official' band, along with leaders Glenn Frey and Don Henley. As a longtime fan, I will always consider Schmit as a member of Poco (with whom he released over ten records and wrote nearly one hundred songs) and Joe Walsh as a solo artist. From a historic perspective (but certainly not a financial one), their careers as \\"Eagles' seems secondary to me, but it is their presence that fleshes out what otherwise would have been reduced to a singing/songwriting duo.<br /><br /> Interestingly, this collection relies heavily on the subsequent solo work of Frey and Henley (\\"The Boys of Summer\\", You Belong to the City\\" \\"Dirty Laundry\\"), and the previous solo work of Walsh (\\"Rocky Mountain Way\\", \\"Funk #49\\"). Classic tracks like \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling,\\" \\"Life in the Fast Lane,\\" \\"Lyin' Eyes,\\" \\"New Kid in Town,\\" \\"Hotel California\\" and \\"Already Gone\\" are the reason that people show up, though, and here, they sound like spit-and-polish versions of the original studio recordings. There is no doubt that this band has the goods to play these tunes to perfection. For me, though, the net result is that I really miss Meisner, Leadon and Felder. They were integral to the band when the band was at its most creative, and their absence is palpable. In this configuration, the performances are extremely tight and well-rehearsed, leaving virtually every note sounding processed to perfection. Apparently, this is exactly how their contemporary audience loves them, so I cannot deny the `new' Eagles their extended run of popularity. Still, though, I can't help but wonder how I could ever miss them if they won't ever go away.

B00005JO9J|5.0|The first season of Grey's Anatomy is awesome! I got hooked on the show during this season and ever since I have not missed an episode. It is such a good show; and, if you have not seen it, or even if you have, I recommend you buy this and enjoy the show too!
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I cannot believe this picture!  I have read the book 3 times and it no more reflects what Jane Austen wrote than fly!  There are only a VERY few places in this film that even used lines from the book.  Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth follows the book just as close as it possibly can. My only fault with that picture is that it stopped with the wedding.  Jane Austen had quite a few things to say after the wedding regarding all the characters in the book which wrapped it up nicely. Read it! <br /> <br />P.S. I can't believe Dame Judy Dench lent herself to this film.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The handful of episodes on these DVDs range from the merely enjoyable to the great, but Joss Whedon's Firefly is somewhat frustrating as a \\"complete series\\" because he wasn't given time to complete it, or even to put a satisfactory ending on the show's television incarnation.<br /><br />Mysteries abound after the final episode, with the secrets of many of the characters frustratingly only hinted at, at best.<br /><br />That said, the series is one of the strongest science fiction television series to date and marks a maturation of Joss Whedon's craft -- many of the same archetypes from his Buffyverse appear here, but in more complex and satisfying form. Well worth seeing for any science fiction fan, particularly those who prefer their starships a little more Millennium Falcon and a little less Enterprise.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.
0525948023|5.0|Simply reading the book OR LISTENING (even in the background) to the CD's..the next day....Oh my God, life is more tranquil, people react differently...etc...and it STILL happens with every reading and after every day of listening to these incredible CD's.<br /><br />Every single word Eckhart writes/speaks is accurate (in my opinion). Listen to what he says then step out into life and watch.<br /><br />You don't even have to hear or understand every word to gain the immediate results within yourself and life...NO BOOK has acheived this so profoundly. NONE.
B000051VWW|2.0|Released in 2000, this album has come in many different options.  The original album, which is this CD, has 11 songs and is 44 minutes long. <br /> <br />Also available is a Lovers Rock CD with some bonus live tracks on the disc.  There is also two disc option, with the original Lovers Rock CD, and a bonus CD of a few live tracks. <br /> <br />Lovers Rock is also included as a bonus CD in the DVD Lovers Live (which comes in a standard DVD case).  The best value is to get the Lovers Rock CD with the bonus Lovers Live DVD in the standard jewel case. Confusing? <br /> <br />THIS CD DOES NOT MAKE THE MOST OF SADE'S VOICE OR SONG WRITING. <br /> <br />This is really a stark, stripped down sound for Sade, especially when you compare it to her early work.   <br /> <br />Seven of the tracks are driven by muted electronic rhythms and a muffled background music.  I don't think the sound works well with Sade's vocal style.  She sings flat and without emotion.  All seven of these tracks sound alike and the CD gets boring and monotonous.   <br /> <br />The songs that are good are where she drops the electronic rhythms and lets the emotion of her voice come through, or where she livens up and starts to rock. <br /> <br />On The Sweetest Gift and It's Only Love That Gets You Through, Sade sings to almost no accompanyment.  Here she sings in a great jazz/blues style and really lets the emotion of her voice come through. <br /> <br />King of Sorrow and Immigrant are a little more upbeat rockers. (they are not really rockers, but do rock when you compare to the other tracks on the CD). Here she sings with more energy and variation. <br /> <br />So, if she is the King of Sorrow, I think I might consider turning gay.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I love the BBC version and I went into this movie knowing that nothing could compare to it.  Plus, there is no way you can take a 5 hour long movie and condense it to a 2 hr movie without losing something.  That aside, I really didn't care for there casting.  The chemistry between Elizabeth and Darcy was good, but I was really disappointed in the father.  He is supposed to be a witty, sarcastic man and in this movie he almost acts sluggish, brainless man who has very little thought.  I also didn't like the fact that they made the family look like they were poor with there drab dresses and run down house.  It almost made it look unbelievable that they would every even be seen associating with Mr. Darcy or Mr. Bingley.  <br /> <br />Darcy and Elizabeth were however very cute together, and while the movie seemed like it tried to pack all the high points in, which made it seem a little rushed, it was still a cute love story.  It's not the Pride and Prejudice most know and love, but it was still worth watching.

B000E5N62U|5.0|Listening to Two Against Nature, Everything Must Go and this disc in succession, one feels the irony dance around him/her like drops of water in a summer rainshower. The album is filled with bouncy jazz-pop, rock riffs, attitude and groove. If you've gotten this far (to Fagen's Morph The Cat page at Amazon), you're going to buy this album. And you should. He (and, to a lesser degree, Becker) manage to craft memorable tunes on a variety of levels: the music sails, dips and jumps with jazz chops against rock and rhythm sensibility. The lyrics are suggestive, ironic dalliances of nuance; and the feel of each track changes slightly, but the effect is, for the most part, the same: you feel like you've been invited to a private party with a bunch of intellectual hipsters who happen to be virtuso musicians and want to stimulate your brain and your soul, sort of like a dry-ice martini. <br /> <br />It's a shame this party only comes around every five or so years, whether in the guise of Steely or Fagen (or Becker) discs, but so be it; good things are worth waiting for, and great things are worth savoring. <br /> <br />Buy it.
B000AL730Y|5.0|On PBS I actually saw a performance in Abbey Road Studios where Paul was performing the music on this album for a very small audience. The music was awesome, and his performance was very down to earth and personable.<br /><br />So, at the end of the show I watched the credits, got the name of the album/music and tracked down this version of the CD here at Amazon. While the DVD in this set is not that PBS performance, it is great nonetheless. There is a 30 minute documentary of Paul in the studio recording this album. Paul details how he came up with the music, what he had in mind when he wrote each song, etc. Moreover, the DVD includes a studio music video, and music put to a video of the line art of the album.<br /><br />This album is one where Paul does a little more exploring with chords, movements, key changes, and various instruments and recording techniques (sort of like the Beatles' \\"White Album\\"). Every song on this album has its own personality, its own flavor and texture, which means every song is different and not typical at all. This is the feature I like the most about this album.<br /><br />Paul draws from every influence of previous music from all types of different artists who had an impact on him (including going as far back as Fred Astaire). While I enjoy every song on the album, in my opinion, some of the better songs on the album include \\"English Tea,\\" \\"Too Much Rain\\" (which I think has a very John Lennon and George Harrison feel to it), \\"Jenny Wren,\\" and \\"Riding to Vanity Fair.\\" If you are a Paul McCartney fan then I recommend this special edition CD/DVD collection, it is well worth the price!
B00009P1O5|3.0|[...] This is just more of the entirely unfounded pretense with which so many close-minded fans fuel misinformed criticism. Take these lines from Dylan's song, \\"Wiggle Wiggle\\", the opening track from his 1991 album, \\"Under The Red Sky\\".<br /><br />Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,<br />Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,<br />Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,<br />Wiggle like a big fat snake.<br /><br />Now, call me crazy, but I'm fairly certain that this fails to meet the aforementioned reviewer's standards for \\"songwriting\\". That is exactly the point: Neil Young's \\"Reactor\\" is much-maligned for applying an aesthetic fraught with ruthless feedback and distortion to a weak selection of songs, but to object to Reactor on those grounds completely misses the point.<br /><br />If this album's flaws are more of the same-old Neil Young \\"flakiness\\", it is the same \\"flakiness\\" that characterizes rock 'n roll's legacy--a legacy Neil Young defines as accurately on Reactor as on any other record. Reactor's snotty abandon and feedback-laden indifference constitute the kind of temperament that great rock 'n roll thrives on, and if it fails to conjure greatness on Reactor, then it is, at worst, a powerful tribute to the soul of rock music.<br /><br />A boundless ambition pervades Reactor that is at once charming and confounding: the frenzied wail and shriek of \\"Shots\\", the thumping, deceptively political railroad anthem, \\"Southern Pacific\\", which made for a killer acoustic tune at some of Neil Young's live solo shows back in 2000, the 10 or 11 minutes of Neil Young shouting \\"ain't got no t-bone!\\" amid Crazy Horse's famous thrash-and-grind sound. These performances exemplify what is great about rock 'n roll far more powerfully than any of those contrived classic rock anthems you crank up on the radio at work every day.<br /><br />Take a chance on Reactor. Listen to something different, something that refuses to make friends, something too sincere to earn air time on any of America's thousand crummy classic rock stations. Few experiences are more gratifying than getting weird looks from other drivers when you crank up this album on your car stereo at a red light with the windows down. It proves you're listening to something that's true. Reactor is the real thing: are you?<br /><br />[...]ic rock stations.

B00005JOE8|5.0|\\"V for Vendetta\\" is going to confuse a lot of people. Nevertheless, and make no mistake about it, this is movie making of the highest order, combining all the finest elements of great storytelling into a potent roller coaster of a movie filled with great action,intellect and above all, ideas.  Its message can - and will - easily be dismissed by naysayers as sophomoric or too \\"out there,\\" or \\"anti-american\\" but there is also an earnestness here that will resonate strongly, and perhaps, frighteningly, to many viewers who will not fail to see the correlation between this fictional tale and the way the world we live in works.      Filled with stereotypes and archetypes, \\"V\\" is unapologetic in its essaying of morality and in its strongly held sentiment that this tale is \\"for the people, by the people.\\"   Brothers and writers Larry and Andy Wachowski (of Matrix fame) have infused their screenplay with the anger, confusion and hope captured in Alan Moore's original graphic novel - and it's better looking as a result.      I truly believe that many who see \\"V\\" will be upset by it, but hopefully more of us will be inspired by its bold, blatant message and take a good hard look at ourselves and the way the world works around us and see that, with sacrifice and thoughtfulness, the world can be changed.      As Evey, Natalie Portman is cast in something of the \\"victim\\" role, but she makes us route for her, and to her credit she goes beyond that making the transformation of her character not only believable, but in the end, noble.      Hugo Weaving - the man behind the mask - gives a performance that can only be described as mesmerizing.  As \\"V\\" he exposes all of the strength and weakness of a character that is equal parts savior and villain.      The physical production is beautiful in its realism as it paints a nightmarish world of the not-very-distant future (2020) and is chilling in its depiction of governmental power, socio-political corruption and, ultimately, the complacency of its citizens.  Weaving's \\"V\\" challenges, and ultimately changes all of that, as he quickly unravels the fabric of civilized society, capturing the public with his bold ideas - and with the promise and permanancy of change through rebellion and political uprising.      Most chillingly, the film invokes the dread once feared in \\"1984\\" but with a renewed vigor that drives home the horrors Orwell foresaw, and still loom large in our comfy modern world.  Chilling?  You betcha!  For those who know the novel, there is little skimping, and, given the current world situation, one must absolutely applaud the filmmakers for \\"going there\\" as far as the ending is concerned.  This is film making at its emotional and challenging best.      Are there flaws?  Of course there are, but ultimately \\"V for Vendetta\\" rises far above them in its presentation of a world filled with ideas that have forever been debated, and does it in a story well told, beautifully acted and full of hope for humankind.   Not bad work for a movie.  Actually, it's magnificent.
1558908382|5.0|This is the movie that makes you stand up and cheer for comedy that's so dark, you don't want it to be funny. Then it just is.<br /><br />Right from the opening, when \\"I can see clearly now\\" starts up and you hear John Cusak's character Martin on the phone, you're smiling. That song could make anyone smile. Then, when Martin picks off this guy on a bike with a high power rifle, you're just sort of cracking up.<br /><br />And there are lots of scenes like that, where you go into it smiling, something horrible happens and you just find yourself laughing. And laughing and laughing. You'll see.

6305428220|4.0|One does love a good apocolyptic thriller with the world coming to in an end at the hands of some all powerful force. What better force to work with than Aliens!<br /><br />It's a Body Snatchers meets Saved by the Bell. The aliens are slipping the skins of any and everyone in a sleepy Ohio town. Why Ohio, you might ask? Well, as the film so adeptly points out, \\"Would you come in all Independence Day or just slip in through the back door?\\" Get a toe hold and then, boom, world domination.<br /><br />The only thing standing in these aliens way? A sterotypical 'we-wouldn't-be-friends-otherwise' group of students that are here to save the day. The film takes some leaps and liberties with our disbelief, making intuitive leaps that could only be scritped. But all in all, quite worth the time and happily entertaining.
006056251X|4.0|So far, this is my favorite of the Wallflower series.  I liked both of the main characters very much, and enjoyed watching them develop.  I know that it's unlikely a notorious rake like Lord St. Vincent could fall madly in love with a shy, stammering girl like Evie (especially so quickly), but you can always hope.<br /><br />Most of my enjoyment came from St. Vincent's character.  I don't know what it is about bad boys.  In real life, I do my best to stay as far away from them as possible, but I know I would be doomed if I ever came across someone like Lord St. Vincent.  You can only resist raw passion and intense animal-magnetism for only so long.<br /><br />The Devil in Winter is a satisfying read and I highly recommend it.
