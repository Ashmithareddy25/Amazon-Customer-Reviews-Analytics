0385349831|5.0|Paulo Coelho imparts timeless wisdom, though not in the allegorical way we enjoyed in The Alchemist. This time Coelho eloquently delivers the pearls directly, through the fictional character Copt. Many of the sage's sayings are beautiful reminders of what your soul already knows, but they gently prod readers to reexamine their dreams and live life to the fullest.

B005KXU83G|5.0|When you hear Bob Seger live like on this album, you truly gain an appreciation for his talent.  Listening to him live he is much more powerful and I love because it is live they can extend some of the songs out and give the songs more depth.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Saw this movie, it was filmed in Mississippi and loved the movie, have the book and wanted to keep the movie for a keepsake.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Really, what else is there to say about this great Showtime series.  Season 7 is right up there with the others.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|this downloaded and functioned fine on my first gen kindle<br /><br />I downloaded this for my kids because they love cut the rope, but I tried it out and it's a fun little game, lots of levels, cute graphics, and not impossible for my kids to play - this game is worth buying although I got it for the faotd I would pay for this if not overpriced.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|This isn't your run of the mill movie.  It's long and you have to pay attention.  You can't be talking, texting, or playing on the computer or you will miss something important as it rapidly jumps getween time and charcters.  Be sure to watch the credits and see all the different parts the actors played as all the mail ones had several.  It isn't for everybody as I'm sure you can tell by the widely varied ratings.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|One of the best albums I've heard in quite a while. They go from rock to metal to rockabilly with no effort whatsoever and make it legit. I love bands like this that seem to do exactly what they want and worry about sales later. A great bonus is &#34;Room 24&#34; with King Diamond, made me go back and dust off my KD and Mercyful Fate stuff.
B00932A6G4|3.0|This is B move sci-fi and if you liked the other &#34;Starship Troopers&#34; you will like this one.  I'm glad there are places online where I can watche these B movies without paying A movie prices.

B00CHI5B7A|3.0|There was nothing special or different about this movie.  It's jusy okay.  I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price at the theater.
B007T99ENE|4.0|A compelling read. Fairly unusual in the early stages and I felt a little perplexed. I empathised with the heroine, a word that is not exactly right for Serena as she seemed so vulnerable with neither support from her family,the remote Bishop and social conscious Mother, nor a meaningful education. Her sister was the tearaway but Serena at a tender age embarks on an affair with a much older married man. At this point I was curious as to where the plot would go. Her dalliances seemed fraught right to the end which I found disconcerting but also testimony to her ability to trad on precarious ground. She really did seem quite hapless but also adventurous for one so young. Her job made me squirm as it portrayed the inferior status of women and the rather obscure purpose of M15. I struggled with a few passages, mostly to do with the job,but overall enjoyed &#34;Sweet Tooth'. The end was very satisfying as it seemed to vindicate Serena's trust and daring.
B0083GQKQG|1.0|One meaningless scene, and then another, and then another, and on and on and on and on.  It's not the ability of the actors, especially not Swinton, who,s proven herself time and again to be excellent.  It's the garbage that they allow themselves to be a part of.  This film seems to be just one more example of an unfortunate genre that has arisen whereby the film making community, evidently, decide to make a movie for nothing more than self gratification, and their own celebration of themselves.  What normal self respecting person could allow themselves to suffer through this kind of tripe?  Give me a break!!!!!
B008L1F91A|5.0|I bought this because I'm a a bit of a comic nerd.  The statue is extremely well done and realistic looking...not the iconic superman of the comic books or movies...perhaps a Superman in his early 20's.  Again, a really nice fit for anyone's collection.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft Pocket Edition is great! It is updating to be more and more like the computer and Xbox version. There are also great moding apps for this game, like PocketEditor Pro (or something like that) that make the game even better. The game is worth the money! And it works great on Kindle Fire.
1476734941|5.0|The one thing I did not like is that all weights are only in ounces and not also in grams.

B004HHKFIY|5.0|I purchased this for my 4 year old son and he loves it! It works on his wooden train set (Ikea, Melissa&Doug, etc). The only issue is, it is a bit chunky compared to other wooden trains so it doesn't fit so well under some of the bridges but we make it work and my son loves it none the less!
B005FLX2WC|5.0|What a fantastic combo of voice & axe work. When Beth emulates Etta it is spot on. Her vocals on I'd rather go blind & I'll take care of you show case what a true artist she is. Joe, what can you say the dude can just flat out play. I love when he drops down & grabs one from the bottom or just makes those strings cry.
B001UAX56A|5.0|I don't know that anyone would ever be able to replicate a fantastic piece of work such as this. This album goes down in time as one of the best.
0553386794|1.0|This is not an arbitrary 1 star. I feel about these books like I felt about all the time I wasted watching LOST; very poorly planned out with increasing levels of disappointment resulting in the final thought \\"What an incredible waste of time!\\". I admit I get sucked into each book - and then read the next one only to become more disappointed. I just finished Book 4. I both listen(audible.com) and I read depending on my mood. It is 40 hours of listening. Now it is an OK way to pass your time commuting etc. but I believe Martin is a sadist. NOTHING nice has happened to any character yet that I can think of. I have been a fan of fantasy for 40 years and if I had to do it over I would never have started reading GOT or watching it on HBO. My mistake - I thought all the books were completed when I started reading. Book 5 is not even the end. Anyone who compares these books to Tolkien is insane. Martin babbles. I have thought long and hard to what series I could best compare it to - which really isn't the same type of fantasy - but Diana Gabldon's Drums of Autumn etc. Starts of great, gets fairly depressing and then goes on and on and on. I loved the history but that couldn't keep me reading. GOT must have an ending however in contrast to Gabaldon's books. From now on I will not commit to any books or TV shows that are works in progress.  Getting ready to go into Book 5 I am very ambivalent about spending the $ on a hardcover especially after reading the amazon reviews. If you like books that never have anything good happen to the characters - this is your series! As someone stated in an amazon review I read, in Books 1-4 - there are at least 500 pages describing food. I would add there are 500 pages describing clothes. Martin babbles more than any author I have ever read. I will not read any more of his books.
1884883303|5.0|Great reference book for guitar pricing. People have said that it is not much different than last years edition. Of course it isn't, the prices have not changed that much. I only buy it every several years.
B00993I6D2|5.0|the book was way better, but the movie did a pretty good job of translating it, this is a really old movie too, be warned, if you are a movie buff, you'll enjoy it, if not, best stick with those hollywood blockbusters

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book really ended it all!! It took the reader on a ride and tied up a lot of loose ends from the first and second book. I really enjoyed reading this, and just like the last 2 books this one really picks up speed halfway through the book. Get yourself a copy and dive on in!!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I just loved this book.  The way Drew tells parts of the story like you are in the room with him and giving girls his advice from the male way of thinking is brilliant.  Drew and Kate's sexual chemistry is electric and Drew will do anything to win her over after he screws up.  Getting the nun to talk to her about the wisdom of forgiveness was only one of his plans that had me laughing till I cried.  Drew's 4 year old niece was adorable and you can't help but love her.  She will have more than enough money for college with her bad word jar and she makes sure she collects.  This is a must read book.

B00CW665VI|5.0|\\"My stomach flips with regret and disappointment. What I wouldn't give for a time machine.\\"<br /><br />Tangled is just that a twisted, tangled tale about Drew and Kate, who met briefly in a bar only to, come Monday morning, discover that Kate is the new-hire at Drew's Investment banking firm.  Story is brilliantly told entirely from Drew's POV and we get to follow him as he is thrown into what starts as an attempt at seducing a co-worker/sub-ordinate to a competition for an account and downhill from there...<br /><br />I could go on and on about how much I enjoyed reading and stayed up all night to finish it.  But this story is best experienced.  As a matter of fact don't even bother reading any further just hurry up and get your copy.  Thanks  Ms. Chase for an entertaining , witty all-consuming read!<br /><br />If you are still reading this, not heeding my advice, I have included my thoughts on Drew and Kate below plus some quotes to give you an idea of the wonderfulness that is Drew, droll playboy man-whore extraordinaire!<br />\\"So that's it.

He spends his weeks masterminding, structuring and closing deals affording him both wealth and industry respect.  While his weekends are spent in careless pursuit of his next one-night stand, earning him a scandalous reputation and never-ending line of potential conquests.  That is until Kate!<br /><br />Reading from Drew's POV was truly a joy.  Five words to describe Drew: Sarcastic, witty, smart, insightful and unforgettable.<br />\\"I tell them how it is, give them a good time and then the cab fare home. Thank you, good night. Don't call me, 'cause I sure as sh~ t won't be calling you.\\"<br /><br />***<br />\\"Newsflash, ladies: We can't read your thoughts. And frankly, I'm not entirely sure I'd want to. The female mind is a scary place to be.\\"<br /><br />After meeting and getting to know Drew it was a pleasure to meet Katherine Brooks, Kate the woman who brought him to his knees or should I say sick-bed.  From ordinary rather humble beginnings her intelligence, determination and ambition earned her a scholarship and a MBA at Wharton school of business.  Upon her graduation she is hired by the prestigious Evans, Reinhart and Fisher.  Her new job will prove challenging on so many levels much thanks to Drew.  Not helping matters, she has also brought with her, to the big city, her high-school sweetheart and fianc&eacute;.<br /><br />Five words to describe Kate: Smart, beautiful, assertive, classy and loyal.<br />\\"I'm Drew, by the way.\\" I hold out my hand. \\"And you are?\\"<br />She holds up her hand. \\"Engaged.\\"<br /><br />And so their roller-coaster story begins; For Drew mostly a descent as his life spins out of control:<br />\\"Although my mind recognizes that Kate Brooks is now my rival, apparently my c~  k hasn't gotten the memo.\\"<br /><br />***<br />\\"I told you how I grew up. I never had to share my toys; I don't plan on sharing my clients. Ask any four-year-old--sharing sucks.\\"<br /><br />***<br />\\"I've gone cold turkey. Completely. I haven't even j~ ked off.

B000H7JCIW|5.0|This show, recorded at the famed Radio City Music Hall, captures Liza at her finest.  She has the beauty and energy of youth (46 years old when recorded) combined with the stage maturity required to be in full control.  Indeed, if you are familiar with her famous mother , Judy Garland, you will delight in seeing all the similarities in performance styles and mannerisms.<br /><br />The production has all the elements of show-biz entertainment that one would expect including the funny, the trite, and sincerity that make for an enjoyable view.  She includes a small cast of her gal pals singing and dancing on the great stage.<br /><br />It is on this great stage that she salutes her father, Vincent Minnelli, who was an early designer (costume / sets) at this famed music hall many years ago.  In this montage you will see his creative works from the past.  But perhaps you already know his work..... The famed Toy Soldier costume still worn today by the Radio City Music Hall Rockettes!<br /><br />Enjoy the show!

B002RI9ZPY|4.0|The abused, psychologically damaged Salander with precocious computer skills, in a curious but incredibly close relationship with Mikael Blomquist, crusading journalist finally wreak vengeance on the contumacious psychologist Teleborian, the Section a secretive group within SAPO operating outside the law to protect Salachenko a vicious Russian exile. The trilogy, commencing with the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, then the Girl who Played with Fire, and this the last are a powerful read about spies, conscienceless businessmen, spy games and those who failed to protect the strange but resourceful Salander and her mother from grievous abuse is one of the great series of recent time.  The quality of writing, suspense, tension and the palpably absurd are maintained throughout, but keep a map of Sweden close to hand.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This album seems to have been getting a lot of flack from the general public who grew up on Daft Punk as house pioneers. If a person had no precedent of what Daft Punk was before and listened to this album I would be very surprised if they thought it was subpar in any way. This is a superbly crafted album with wonderful diversity and fantastic production. The relaxed disco vibe permeates the album with electronic innovation, jazz fusion performance vignettes, and pop hook glory filling the ears with delight. Give Life Back to Music, Giorgio by Moroder, Within, Instant Crush, Lose Yourself to Dance, Touch, Fragments of Time, Contact....all major highlights. This album starts strong and ends stronger with a brilliant arc along the way. I strongly believe that the majority of the ridiculous one star reviews are from people who simply can't accept the radical change in style and are reacting viscerally as such. This is a great album, no genre limit can mask that

1623420148|4.0|Oh Drew Evans....you have stolen my heart....let me count the ways...<br />But, first let me tell you what an egotistical jerk you are! I wanted to slap you several times and knock some sense into you!<br /><br />Did I like this book? Absolutely! Why? Because it was witty, funny, charming. It really was the best male POV of I've ever read in my life. Yes, ever.<br /><br />Charming Drew Evans give his account of his story of how he found love with Katherine (Kate) Brooks, when he never thought it would. The story starts off with Drew explaining how he has been out of commission for a week because of a \\"flu\\". However, when his sister and work colleague show up at his place, we soon discover the flu, is really a broken heart. Drew gives his account of how he met Kate, his heartache, and everything after.<br /><br />I loved how the male point of view was finally done with justice! It was accurate and honest. The author has a wonderful writing style that allowed you to experience Drew's story and be immersed in his journey in realizing what love really is. This is not your typical romance novel. Drew is not your typical hero. He's a jerk. And that's putting it mildly. He makes no apologies for his womanizing ways. However, don't let that deter you. You WILL fall in love with him, without realizing it. Kate was such a refreshing character. I loved that the author gave us a beautiful, educated intelligent woman. While Drew was the \\"big dog\\" at his firm, Kate easily was looked at in the same regard among her peers. We need more strong female leads like her!<br /><br />I truly enjoyed this refreshing story. Not many authors could pull this off, but Emma Chase did. Reading from a male POV put a unique twist on the story. I loved watching Drew Evans grow as a person and as a man. Most importantly, I loved watching him fall in love with Kate. I recommend this story to anyone who is looking for a real (honest) love story.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|This Heat Sink is a little tall so if you have a small case then you might want to take measurements before buying.  It comes pretty close to the first RAM slot but I was still able to use it just fine (it doesn't touch the RAM but gets very close to it).  I was using a stock fan on a Core i7 3770K and while playing Assassins Creed 3 my temps got up to like 85C the processor shuts down at 105C and that was just too close for comfort.  I put this on along with a Rosewill Thor V2 case (great airflow) and my temps were at 43C while running AC3 and around 31 at idle, oh and I have it overclocked to 4.6 ghz.  So I am very pleased with this air cooler and I am glad I didn't buy a liquid cooler, I am not a hardcore gamer but I do like to play occasionally and so this totally exceeds my needs.  I would recommend this to anyone who is on the edge about liquid cooling and just want to be able to overclock and keep semi low temps.

B008K5T5AI|5.0|I love a good Culture novel, and I enjoyed reading The Hydrogen Sonata by Iain M. Banks at least as much as any of his others.<br />Since the events in Excession, the ships in the ITG (Interesting Times Gang) seem to have retired from being involved in high level events, but fear not, a new motley crew of minds comes together to meddle, with the best of intentions, in the affairs of another civilization.<br />As is expected, the ship names and their respective attitudes and humour is colourful and creative, hilarious at times. In particular I enjoyed some of the side-channel communications between ships as they comment on or make fun of other ships behind their backs as it were.<br />Interesting new tech, weird places, bizzare things. The flat, flying artificial sentient pet drapes itself like a cape; large scale weird alien art, such as a mountain in a windy area holed to produce a massive but complex Sound; the guy with 56 penises driven by four hearts so he can have sex with a record number of people; of course, enough but not overwhelming techno-babble about ship tech when they perform outrageous feats of \\"disloc\\", or weapons fire in battles. It's pretty much a constant stream of delight really.<br />The actual writing was complex but always understandable with a good flow. Banks often uses dashes to separate an aside within a sentence - because, you know, it can be annoying when you get lost in a tangent - to improve readability. I didn't do that very well, but you get the point. Descriptive sentences are often very long and complex, dense with detail, but as long as you are immersed, and not distracted, it really pulls you along.<br />A fantastic read.<br />Also, if you enjoy Banks' writing, you should visit here, as he is \\"officially Very Poorly\\".<br /><br />[...]

0345803485|3.0|If you're thrilled by the thought of a rich and powerful young man having his way with a willing girl who isn't sexually mature enough to have her own will, this is a great book. There wasn't much to the story, although it reads better than pornography. It seemed to take an abrupt turn at the end, as if the author wanted to end it, but the story wasn't ready to end there. It just shouldn't have ended that way. There was no point during the book where I felt involved or attracted, but neither was it repelling or disturbing until the illogical ending. I'm told I should read the sequels, but I'm just not inspired. If I found them on my desk, I might pick them up and read them.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love this game!!!! It is a mix of OZ: THE GREAT AND POWERFUL and TEMPLE RUN 2&amp;1 !!!!!! If you have just 99 cents it is so worth it! They could make it $1.99

B0063IH60K|1.0|Down loaded this game for my child to the free time app.  Every time you start it up there is an advertisement, some not appropriate for children.  I tried to remove it but it will not delete.  So if you want to have a game on your kindle fire that always starts with ads some not appropriate for children that you can not remove then this is the game for you.  If not I would look elsewhere.  Sorry I could not give it zero stars.
0307887448|4.0|I had really high expectations when I was ready to start reading Ready Player One. I had heard rave reviews about it and multiple people had almost begged me to buy it (knowing that I was a big science fiction fan). So I picked it up expecting to read a possible classic along the lines of Ender's Game.<br /><br />What I go instead though, was a very fun, exciting novel that seemed to be 3/4th of the way finished. The concept was exciting and interesting, but since much of it wasn't exactly brand new, there needed to be something else that carried it besides a tsunami of 80s references. And that was the main problem. The dialogue constantly ranged between kinda good and mediocre, the aforementioned 80s references were fun, but weren't always well integrated into the story, the huge opportunity to compare and contrast the OASIS world and the real world was only somewhat recognized and there was little or no development of the main antagonist. That last part is something that really frustrated me latter in the story. At the end of the book there was a great chance to have a satisfying confrontation, but because Sorrento was barely seen or heard throughout the whole book, his demise was akin to a policeman shooting down a blank target.<br /><br />So you might be saying, \\"Then why in the hell did you give this book a 4 star rating\\"? Well I did that because I felt the book did improve after a bumpy start. The dialogue was still mediocre, but the referencing improved and Cline did a very good job creating the vast fictional world of OASIS as well as making the reader care about the main characters as well as his friends. Most of all though, I just couldn't put the book down after around the 200 page mark and I couldn't honestly rate it 3 stars when I was clearly still enjoying it enough to read through the story that quickly.<br /><br />Still, I really wish that this book would've gone through a few more edits because it had a lot of potential to be more than it is. ReadyPlayer One is still a very worthy read. It reads exceptionally quickly and is a lot of fun, but don't go into it expecting to be amazed. Expect to be entertained and if you're really looking for a scifi classic that reads nearly as fast, I'd recommend Ender's Game, The Forever War, or A Scanner Darkly.

B000005H3M|2.0|I first saw buddy rich in 1941 at the paramont theatre in NY. He was with the Tommy Dorsey band.<br />Its safe to comment that Rich drove the band with his powerful style. I don't remember any other drummer<br />of that period and there were many outstanding ones but no one who was so dominant.<br />Listening to &#34;Big Swing Face&#34; Rich was still performing at a high level but the music was best described as<br />Noise. I plan to listen again in the event I missed something.

B00B1E6FF8|4.0|A good story, well told -- but does not rise to the Oscar level of quality. I put Les Miz and Argo above this film, in that order. Still, it's a film every American should see to appreciate the intricacies required by both the CIA and the Navy Seals to pull off this incredible coup.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have been rereading these books for years now. Every time I read them, I find something new in them. I would recommend these books to anyone who likes to read. Even teens like to read this book and is a great read.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I have been in love with this musical since I first saw it in Philadelphia in the late-1980s, and had been eagerly anticipating the movie for months. It did not disappoint! The live recording (rather than lip-synch) works marvelously. Every note, emotion, and tone is perfect. I particularly appreciated the director's comments, which helped me understand how Tom Hooper cut portions of some songs, reordered songs or scenes, and overall improved the flow of the story from the stage version, while retaining the full impact of the musical. This appears to be a &#34;love-it-or-hate-it&#34; movie. My wife and I loved it, but that does not mean it's for everyone. For my money, Les Miz should have won the Oscar for Best Picture, and Hugh Jackman for Best Actor.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This charger lives up to it's claims! What normally took a few hours to charge, (on road) can be accomplished in 45 minutes with this device, tops.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I am anxious to read the third book.  It is well written and a captivating.  A very good book to read.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|This app is awesome. It is a little harder than cut the rope original, but it can be more fun sometimes. I'm so happy that there is a free cut the rope for kindle fire now.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend.  we sit down and make a date night at home when this is on!  But sometimes we miss an episode if something comes up... So we have gone back and sat through the whole season!  Can't wait for the next one!!!!!
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|Absolutely beautiful renditions of some very contrasting Wagner selections.  I wished for more of a break between some of them, however....they seemed to run together too much.  This is truly an extraordinary voice and he sings with full appreciation of the texts.<br />Even the Wesendonck Lieder sound &#34;right&#34; altho much more often heard sung by a female voice.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend.  we sit down and make a date night at home when this is on!  But sometimes we miss an episode if something comes up... So we have gone back and sat through the whole season!  Can't wait for the next one!!!!!

B009NY43NY|4.0|I love these books; however I would have preferred a better ending with her love life. We've all gone through her different relationships and I was hoping for some definite results.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is the world's best game ever.  I tink every one should have this game.  the newest update is may 28 2013
0783227434|5.0|He was surprised and loved it!  We have watched it three times now.  Thank you very much for making this gift a success.
B0054R6BFM|2.0|It was a decently good book in the sense that you wanted to see where the story would end up.  I can see how it has ties of importance to s younger generation, but I personally felt like it was slow and predictable.  Not a bad book, but not my style.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Excellent! Grisham at his finest. Twists I never saw coming and high jinks  all around. His imagination was in high gear.
B00BB67UNW|3.0|I wasn't too keen on seeing this over-hyped matchup between Russell Crowe as a crooked mayor and Mark Wahlberg as former cop.  Billy Taggart, a struggling private investigator now works for Mayor Hostetler.  Surprisingly the movie isn't too bad.  Sure, the testosterone overflows, but Crowe and Wahlberg have both been much worse.  One thing I could have done without is Wahlberg's scenes as a drunk.  Not convincing.<br /><br />Taggart was kicked off the force for shooting and killing a rapist/murderer who was turned loose by the courts.  The victim's sister Natalie (Natalie Martinez) becomes Billy's girlfriend but inexplicably departs midway through the movie.  It's like the filmmaker's just decided to change plots.  Taggart is hired by the mayor to follow his wife, Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is suspected of having an affair.  Alas, there is more to her activities than sex.<br /><br />She has the goods on her hubby and would love nothing better than for him to be defeated in the soon to be held election.  The twists and turns are sharp and frequent but easy enough to keep up with.  Easy enough that you can pretty much see them coming.  Still, my low expectations were exceeded.  While there's not much new here, the film is an entertaining enough take on modern film noir.
B0017YWG2S|5.0|This is a recording hardly found in Brazil and represents a milestone in the history of bossa nova. The sound is top notch.
0896898288|5.0|I really like the large variety of squares from the 20s and am impressed with the history of quilting with different women.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I like this game better than some others I've tried. Never have any problems playing. Brainium games seem to play smoothly.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|At first I was unsure, if this movie really is, what one would expect from an R-Rating, but as soon as the Blu-Ray was delivered and I could take a look at the cover, all my doubts were blown away. The cover, depicting the smouldering ruins of Canterlot, gave a good idea of what the movie would be like, and why it is called \\"Fall\\".<br />Starting with a normal day in Equestria, the movie soon takes a turn and shows how powerless a kingdom which had never faced anything like it can be. Following the destruction of its capital, the antagonistic army soon enslaves the whole nation and forces them to work in their mines. Then, after the former princesses and rebellion leaders are captured and imprisoned in an unknown place, the last hope for freedom is destroyed.<br />While this movie seems to be part of the MLP franchise, it shows a dystopian future, in which the whole kingdom is destroyed and enslaved. With all these dark elements it for sure is no movie meant for kids but the animation style, showing all the character's emotions and feelings in such a great detail give the movie a never before known feeling and should definitely be seen by every adult.<br />I sincerely hope, that there will be a sequel in which the ponies free themselves from the enslavement and reconquer their lost land.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|The game has way to little time. You can get the normal computer demo and it has 100 minutes of gameplay. And for all you people that say this is a copy of minecraft are wrong. They just put In the mod. more animals.
0307271080|5.0|I adored this book (bar the annoying natural hair rants). Vivid characters and she captured the African immigrant experience brilliantly.
0205313426|4.0|The &#34;short course&#34; in sentence structure, direct writing, composition, and common word misuse.  A handy reference for anyone who does a lot of writing.
B000YI7MRM|5.0|This has got to be one of the most accurately portrayed historical films I have ever watched.  It is wonderfully acted, particularly by Viggo Mortensen in the title role.  Mortensen plays Diego Alatriste, a soldier in the service of King Philip IV of Spain, during the Eighty Years War.  An honorable man who raises the son of his slain comrade in arms, sells his sword as a mercenary, and engages in clandestine affairs.  Beautifully filmed and highly enjoyable.
B008LC8TJI|4.0|This is a good album, my favorites are the singles that have been released on the radio. If you like Maroon 5, you will definitely like it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a  Wonderful book to read, i like and enjoy it very much . It was amazing, funny and  very romantic.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this album! It is different than her previous albums & I really like it. It's a lot of fun to listen to!!
B008QMMEOE|5.0|my 3 year old plays this app all the time. she loves it especially popping the bubbles/balloons when she solves the puzzles.  I didn't mind buying more puzzles at all - definitely worth it!
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I love Blake Shelton & his music. This is a great album, he is a wonderful artist!! I definitely recommend it.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this game at first may seem like temple run but the more more you play it the more differences you'll see. You buy different armors and actually have to complete story mode by defeating bosses in the daily challenges.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is one of the most purely beautiful games I have ever seen! It is intricate, logical, and works perfectly on my Kindle Fire HD. It would be nice if it were longer; I hope there are more games from this developer, I'm going to look for them as soon as I hit &quot;submit&quot; ;))
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Fascinating and heart breaking.  Everyone should read what the &#34;Dear Leader&#34; and now his son are doing to people like you and me.
B000002TP7|1.0|One of my favorite albums of all time. This 1-star review is based on my Amazon online purchase experience.<br /><br />I purchased online, as I lost my prior CD version, and was VERY disappointed that one of my favorite tracks is omitted from this version: &#34;Get it Together&#34;, with Q-Tip. In fact, this song being stuck in my head was the reason that I made the purchase.<br /><br />Lame.
B000000W94|4.0|Great mix of Peter green tunes by Gary Moore playing the same guitar that Peter used. Well worth listening to!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Wonderful title and wonderful book.  This book was interesting and amusing.  So much so that I laughed out loud at times.  A pleasure to read.  So glad it was recommended to me.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I'm so dissatisfied and disappointed with this final book of the series that I still can't believe Ms Charlaine Harris would do this to her fan to her sookie Stackhouse fans. She did great through out the series and don't know what happened. Why did she give this great series such a bad and poor ending. I'm a true and loyal fan of sookie Stackhouse series and couldn't believe the way this series ended. I'M STILL SHAKEN AND IN DENIAL. CAN'T BELIEVE IT. I CAN'T EVEN WRITE CORRECTLY AND CAN'T EVEN COLLECT MY EMOTIONS ABOUT THIS BOOK BECAUSE I FELT LET DOWN. THE AUTHOR COULDVE ENDED THE SERIES DIFFERENTLY. ALL I HAVE TO SAY IT WAS A HORRIBLE ENDING AND WAS AND STILL IS VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE AUTHOR.
B005NJU8PA|2.0|Found it crap did not progress too far into book. Left it. Might pick it up in summer when I have time to pass.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is an awesome game. The objectives are cool and the graphics are very nice. I would recommend this game to anyone that reads fantasy books.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|{2.5 stars}<br /><br />The whole story is claustrophobically framed by long passages of Margaret Thatcher in later life, living in a private flat, imagining her deceased husband is still with her, fussing over the rising price of milk, etc. Much of it seems half-intentionally satirical, and it's hard to know how to take THE IRON LADY as a whole. There are some interesting flashbacks to Thatcher's early life and her political career; yet, it's never a good sign when the back-story outshines the front-story. This life story had so much potential and would have worked infinitely better as a linear biography from a more distant point of view.<br /><br />Probably worth sitting through if you're interested in its general subject, but it will also probably prove quite unfulfilling in the end. Good performances by Streep and Broadbent, but they are not of that much value when the story itself is so languid.
B00B0U2SEA|3.0|Well what can I say about this great master piece from Spielberg. The movie was great.<br />But I'm very disappointing with the Limited Edition.<br />Whereas, UK version of the same Limited Edition have included booklet. For, this price<br />we deserve more the BD+DVD+DC+UV. Why on earth we need DVD when we can watch this movie in BD with better picture and sound quality.<br />Hope in future we get something special if it is Limited Edition or Collector Edition.<br />Or I would suggest we just by the normal edition BD with cheaper price.<br />Thank you.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|Easy to use &amp; lots of options.  Will be great for all thise summer snapshots that you just have to share right away.  Super fun too.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I play this game while I am waiting. You can start and stop anytime. There is plenty of puzzle time, wondering what do I do next. I will be sure to order more games by &#34;Big Fish&#34;.<br /><br />Vilita
B002RI9X8S|4.0|Fascinating and depressing. Loving resiliant people who just can't take a trick.<br />A reminder that any one of us could be an okie or a refugee or a seeker of asylum and how we treat such people in our community should be how we would like to be treated.
B003O86FMW|4.0|A must read, I found it to be better than expected and much more interesting than the first book. I highly recommended purchasing this trilogy.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|my 15 year old sister and me have so much fun endless fun we love the /faces and the colors and hair styles you can use/make :-)
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|Amazing book.  Probably one of my favorites.  Really opens your eyes to a lifestyle many people but feel the need to keep hidden.
B009PNQUXO|3.0|Can you like search videos and stuff? cause im just now downloading it and the . last one i had you couldnt sigh in or search
B007B5EDEG|5.0|I absoultly love it, best series I've ever read, cannot put it down, so many twists and turns, i can never see coming. Love reading from so many different perspectives
0061122416|5.0|This is a great, great book. It is filled with wisdom and life lessons and though the story is fictional, one can easily related with the main character's desire to fulfill an almost \\"impossible\\" dream. The reviewer who said that this book is about chasing things and worldly possessions has completely missed the mark. I think a reader who views this story solely about a boy/shepherd chasing after material treasures lacks any depth, dimension or wisdom. There is a deeper message to this book and if one has an open heart and mind, one will be touched by it.
B004IK8Q86|5.0|While it seems to go nowhere, it really does.  There is little suspense, but all the characters are so well drawn that the reader will end up thinking they are friends or acquaintances.  The reader will want to know more but will know there is no more to know.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book shows a lot of research done by Sheryl about how gender bias affects woman’s life in a way we can never imagine (and by we I mean both men and women). I highly recommend this book to all working women and to men as well so they can have a better understanding on how women is so far behind in leadership positions.
B001F6ZIXC|5.0|Review:  Sons of Anarchy - Seasons 1 thru 5<br />5+++ Stars<br />Review Date: May 24th 2013<br /><br />I have been MIA on my blog and I wanted to let you guys know why so I decided to do a \\"review\\" for Sons of Anarchy (SOA).  This is because I just did a five day binge of this TV show on Netflix and I LOVED it!!!!  I did absolutely no reading - and that is saying something...<br /><br />I am unfamiliar with doing reviews for TV shows so bear with me. Here it goes...<br /><br />I have heard about SOA before and how great it is but I am not a \\"TV\\" person, obviously I'm more of a bookworm, so it took a while to check it out.  I had just finished reading Unbeautifully by Madeline Sheehan and I LOVED it - like I LOVED Undeniable (and liked Reapers Property too).  So I decided that I might like a TV show about the MC (motorcycle club) life too.  And I did. Hence, the five day binge.<br /><br />SOA is about an MC named \\"SAMCRO\\" which stands for Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club Redwood Original.  It is the \\"original\\" -> first SOA chapter, and is located in Charming a small town in northern California, but there are currently chapters throughout the US, and one in Belfast, Ireland (there may be more, IDK).<br /><br />The main characters are Charlie Hunnam, Katy Segal (formerly Peg in Married with Children), Ron Perlman, Maggie Siff, Kim Coates, Mark Boone, Tommy Flanagan, Ryan Hurst, Theo Rossi, and Dayton Callie.<br /><br />Charlie Hunnan plays Jackson \\"Jax\\" Teller, the lead actor and Vice President of SOA and the son of the founder and former president.  He is in his early thirties and is basically finding himself as a person and a member of SOA.  In the first episode he finds a manuscript his father wrote before he died (in 1992) basically stating that he thought things were going in the wrong direction for the club, and that he envisioned more of a brotherhood and less criminal activity when he founded SOA. Jax appears to feel the same way and this has him conflicted to say the least.<br /><br />Jax is a complex individual, extremely smart, sexy, charming, and has a big heart.  But he is also a biker.  This means he is also rough, smokes, drinks a lot, uses women, and lives as an outlaw with his own set of codes and beliefs. He has never taken a life at the beginning of season one but that changes drastically as the show evolves.<br /><br />Jax's mother Gemma Teller-Morrow played by Katy Segal, is also a complex individual but has little in the way of a conscience or morals.  She is willing to do anything to further her own agenda, including playing with the very lives of the other characters.  Sometimes I like her, but at others I can't stand her--like I said she is complex.<br /><br />Each character has their own multifaceted persona's.  I became invested in each one of them, sometimes I hated them but mostly I loved them.  I understood why they had to do many of the horrible things they did--meaning when a person lives outside the law they are no longer protected from it.  They have to take the law into their own hands, I get it.  This is not just a small time MC, it's a hard-core biker gang dealing with big players including the heads of the IRA (Irish Republican Army), Mexican drug cartels, and of course other gangs.<br /><br />Now onto my take of it.  Yes I said I loved it but why?  Because I became extremely emotionally invested in the characters and the storyline.  I cried hard and often.  But I also laughed my ass off too many times to count.  There is a darkly comedic undertone to SOA. This is what made the show brilliant--the ability to bring out the full spectrum of emotions.  I could literally be sobbing one second then cracking up the next. I cannot remember ever being so emotionally invested and so thoroughly entertained by a show before...<br /><br />If you cannot handle violence DO NOT watch this show.  It is extremely graphic.  And it is not a romance.  It does have enough romance to keep me interested but not a lot. Jax's love life is one of the primary themes but it does not overpower the show at all.  It was obviously made this way for men to like it as much if not more than woman, but Jax is way too hot for women not to have been considered when casting.<br /><br />I highly recommend you at least watch the pilot to see if this show may be for you.  The first four seasons are on Netflix and the fifth season I pain twenty bucks for on Amazon.  It was worth it.  The sixth season starts next fall.  It ends on a cliffhanger so be prepared.  But a few of the other seasons ended that way so I was not all that surprised.<br /><br />~StacyHggt. Jax's love life is one of the primary themes but it does not overpower the show at all.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game it's so fun but challenging to get up hills.I think that it was going to be a good idea to make another game of awesome.
B00CRW2066|5.0|I'll be honest, I was a little hesitant to buy this but did so without even listening to the samples. I find samples don't really give you the true feeling of the song. I immediately found each song was just as good as the last. Absolutely brilliant. I discovered The National not too long ago and now own four of their albums. Trouble Will Find Me is one of the best overall albums I've experienced to date.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My coverage part was his standing ovation and of course the end  when he appreciated his mom and dad making him go to school.. Annie, 9
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|Although the game says for ages 7 and up, my five year old daughter enjoys the game as well. Also, you can \\"tweak\\" the rules to make it a two player game and it's just as fun! Love it.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I am sad to see the series come to an end, but all great things have to stop sometime. I had a feeling it would end like it did,but not everyone will be happy about it. I would have preferred a different ending, but I still loved the book!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Can't wait for the next one! The graphics and touch controls are very fluid. The atmospheric noise and music are also great.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Seriously... where did this come from?  My partner picked it up for his Kindle: read it, loved it, and passed it on to me.  What a wonderful read!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|If you liked temple run 1 &amp; 2 you will love this game and this time you get to last longer and not just die when you hit a tree or something
0307341550|4.0|Gillian Flynn is pretty. She has a nice smile, big brown eyes and an open, friendly face. On closer examination, however, there's something wrong about that smile, something sardonic. And her eyes look so directly and unblinkingly at the camera that one feels a challenge has been leveled. I think the challenge is, \\"Read this!\\"<br /><br /> \\"This\\" is Flynn's debut novel, \\"Sharp Objects.\\" It's a story that shreds the image of pretty little girls in bows and pigtails, women as the weaker sex, women as precious and vulnerable, women as we thought we knew them. Flynn's women and girls are right out of the Brothers Grimm, or Bedlam, or Macbeth.<br /><br />Where does this pretty young wife and mother, born in Kansas City, Missouri, raised by two apparently loving, intelligent parents derive the malice that permeates her book? How does a happily married mother and pet owner come up with this evil that coagulates on the pages of her book?<br /><br />It is a mystery perhaps equal to that of \\"Sharp Objects,\\" a story of the murder of two young girls, whose bodies are discovered oddly preened and made up, but with most teeth having been pulled. The little town of Wind Gap, Missouri, an 11-hour drive south of Chicago, is abuzz with rumor and gossip, but it turns out that the good people of Wind Gap are prone to rumor and gossip anyway; it doesn't take a couple of gruesome murders to set tongues flapping, but it's a welcome diversion for people living in a community whose economy derives primarily from raising hogs and processing them into hams.<br /><br />Flynn's story is narrated by `Camille Preaker,' a thirty-something woman learning her trade as a reporter at a third tier newspaper in Chicago. Her editor, presented as something as a cliche' in Flynn's book, learns of the murders in Wind Gap and knowing the his young reporter is originally from Wind Gap, asks her to go there and cover the story. He does so with some misgivings, because Camille is one troubled young woman. Camille suffered from a cutting disorder as a child growing up under the cloying care of her mother, Adora, the hog plant-owning matriarch of Wind Gap. Flynn's Adora takes her place easily among literature's most unforgettable mothers, making Sophie Portnoy seem nothing to complain about.<br /><br />Camille retains her urge to inflict pain on herself and it is only through great determination and copious amounts of vodka and any other alcoholic beverage available that she seems able to resist the urge to carve words into her flesh; wretched, queasy, spiteful, omen.<br /><br />Returning to Wind Gap, Camille encounters her 13-year-old half sister, Amma, who also enjoys inflicting pain, but her urges are turned outward. Flynn's portrayal of Camille's experience getting to know her mother again, and her teen half sister is frighteningly believable. We can't help but utter under our breath, \\"Don't do that,\\" but we know she will and we know bad things will happen, and we can't wait to turn the page and read about them.e suffered from a cutting disorder as a child growing up under the cloying care of her mother, Adora, the hog plant-owning matriarch of Wind Gap.

159562015X|1.0|I was really disappointed by the results of the Strengths Finder test; not because it was inaccurate, but because it provided little to no insight.  Strengths Finder claims to help you figure out your talents and supposedly gives you specific instructions on how to make them work for you in the workplace.  Everything is generalized and I felt like I was reading my horoscope, which might be more helpful than this book.  Rath does mention one factor that intrigued me though. Talent multiplier x Investment multiplier.  I wish he would've delved into that more and made it part of the assessment.  At the end of the day if you can't figure out what your talents are, this book will not help you. Do some trial and error or ask me.
B008PUF3VS|3.0|Nine-year-old Bruno's life is suddenly turned upside down when he returns home one day to find his family packing their belongings to leave. They move to a place Bruno calls \\"Out-with\\" as a result of his father's promotion after a visit from the \\"Fury\\". Bruno dislikes the place, is bored and misses his friends. Exploring one day he meets a boy in \\"striped pajamas\\" at a fence and the two become friends.<br /><br />Originally I gave this novel 4.5 stars, not quite certain why I couldn't give it 5 considering the impact the shocking ending had on me, as well as the speedy pace at which I devoured it. Then I read the negative reviews on Amazon and was made aware of how historically inaccurate this is, and because of that reduced my rating to 3 stars. I can understand how other readers can have an issue with the naivete of the characters and the simplicity of the language, but since this is obviously meant for a younger audience that didn't really bother me too much. However I love historical novels and inaccuracies do not sit well with me, even though I was ignorant of them at the time of reading.<br /><br />I'm glad I read this and as a \\"fable\\" as this book is labeled it is pretty good, but to slap history and true Holocaust survivors in the face with blatant historical inaccuracies makes me change my mind about letting my kids read this when they are old enough. Manipulating history to manipulate readers' emotions is not necessary in order to write a good book, so I give the author points for his ability to move the reader, and take away points for fostering ignorance in his audience.
1619695006|5.0|It was very engrossing, but I liked another reviewer's comment that what happened to the characters would have happened to Harry Potter had he not had a protector.  I bought it on audio book and found myself thinking (and talking occasionally, but just to myself), in an English accent.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Doesn't have all the features of FB as you would have on a desk top, but it's alright, I guess.
B00992CF6W|5.0|if you look at all the reviews and their ratings its 5 stars and best game ever stuff,  everyone is saying it was worth not one review says this is bad they say its awesome
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Can't use it like a traditional camera.  You cannot view the picture thru a view finder.  It's works like a mirror effect.  Probably good for Skyping but otherwise, it sucks!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game makes me laugh out loud. I really want to install This on all my devices. It is fantastic to play an the kids love it too.
0525953728|3.0|Haven't read it yet so can't say whether it's any good or not.  Bought it mostly because of the hype associated with the book.
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|I finally received the 2 cd's I ordered. They were in perfect condition and worked just fine in my car, bike and Harley.  Some of the reviews I read said they would not work in American systems. Not true in this case. Since the company is out of the country shipping is a little slow. All and all good deal, works great and awesome price. Thanks
0316044695|3.0|I spent the latter half of this book trying to determine Luttrell's character. As you read on the story is obviously embellished so much so that I began to question the merit of the account in its entirety. Yet I began to think if I was a lone survivor I too would probably embellish the story to see my friends' names be entered into the depths of history. Here's the problem though Luttrell isn't that smart. A great playwright or scriptwriter could have made this story believable, but Luttrell in an attempt to honor his mates over embellished and left massive contradictions in his story, to the point where I think it paints the leader overwhelmingly in poor light. In Luttrell's story Lt. Murphy had a cell phone that was not to be used (as it could be traced by the enemy) unless the situation was dire. The facts are he had a cell phone and a call was made that they were being attacked. Now here's the question you have to ask yourself, would the Lt. wait to make that call until the point that they were all but one mortally wounded. Or does it make more sense that this call was made as soon as they were discovered and started taking fire? The common sense leads us to the latter, but why would Luttrell lie like this? The reason is Luttrell wants to embellish his story and tell this sort of last stand/spartan fight to the death battle against a huge army. In my mind closer to the truth of what happened was these guys were probably discovered and taken by surprise and took immediate fire and causalities. I would bet that one or two died within seconds of being discovered, the Lt. made the call and then was killed and Luttrell did as he said and jumped off a cliff, which allowed him to escape. I just can not believe that the story happened as he told where they jumped off mountain cliffs (as high as sky scrapers) repeatedly, took multiple wounds to the neck head and throat while continuing to fight on for many more minutes. I mean he describes one solider has having part ofhis skull shot off and being able to see his brain yet the man still fights on for several more minutes as well as jumps off another cliff. And he tells these stories for all 3 men, I don't buy it.<br /><br />The other thing that irks me about his character is that here is a guy whose life was saved by local afghanis, yet he tells this story and is actually trying to convince us that seals should be allowed to kill innocent civilians when they are in hostile territory. Does he not see that the herder and his boy that he wanted to kill, could have easily been the afghani doctor and civilians that took him in and saved his life.<br /><br />That being said I gave it 3 stars because I enjoyed it very much when he was telling the truth.  When he was describing the seal training and when he was describing the mountains at night I did not question the plausibility of the stories at all. Yet when he started to embellish and flat out lie he lost me and it's a shame that the leader's reputation is marred like that. My hope is that this movie (which has a good director) will write the story more towards the truth and not allow that cell phone contradiction to expose millions more to this misinterpretation of operation red wings.
B00CW665VI|5.0|When making my decision to purchase this book, I read other reviews. Boy am I glad I did. This book is such a well told story. My understanding is that this is a debut author. Wow! Way to go Emma!<br />This is told from the hero's POV. Very unique. And it is told as if he was sitting right there next to you, telling you the story of how he fell in love. Even if you might think Drew is a little bit of jerk, you can't help but like him.<br />Perfect blend of emotions, spice and it even made me laugh!
B0093LINVK|5.0|Add a mSATA SSD, RAM, Windows 7 and, optionally, a wireless card and you have all you need for most office work. The Core i3 processor is the equivalent of what is found in a basic notebook computer. I assembled mine with a 256GB SSD and 16 GB of RAM. I also installed the Intel WiFi/Bluetooth combo wireless card. That's more than enough computer for most applications. Models with i5 and i7 CPU's will be coming from Intel later in 2013.

B0017YWG2S|5.0|I have a lot of Brazilian music and love it.<br />But I just got this one and find a subtlety in both the music and Regina's singing that is stunning.<br />Jobim wrote all these songs.<br />He sings very little on it, but his vocal style paved the way for Veloso and others.<br />His composing though even surpasses his sensitive singing however and they fit each other like a glove.<br />But Elis's vocals are what makes these songs IMO.<br />There is so much variety from track to track and Elis's interpretations ingeniously vary.<br />This is not just your straight Bossa Nova.<br />It is profound and musically goes where very little music goes.

B000V8A95C|5.0|I should have bought the online CD and not the overpriced on at the theater.  This track was not on any CD available there.  I found it online after a court running said ‘any ripping of CD’s counts as piracy.’  I like my music in the ‘Cloud’ and accessible to any device and so I bought the extended edition MP3 album at a fraction of the cost of the CD at the theater.  I highly recommend this soundtrack and enjoy listening to it.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|I’ve read several books about Steve Jobs and this one is the one that ties them all together.  They all say the same thing when they're written by those that worked with him directly or were friends with him.  Here we see where ‘Steve’ began to become the ‘Steve’ we all saw and became to know.  Some to love him, some to hate him.  So, many times we heard Steve say one thing on the stage and then do something else behind the stage.  He was strong in his Buddhism and yet didn’t follow it completely.  Yet, his beliefs helped him lead a company from ruin to power.  Some people say that Steve’s being kicked out of Apple was a huge mistake.  Actually, from everyone that knew Steve and Steve himself said this is where he learned the skills needed to bring Apple back.  I liked the book and the lessons he teaches.  I just wish his family would release all the recordings they made of Steve for this book.  I also wish Steve had kept the ‘Hacker’ mentality and remembered his roots.

B00CRS88IO|5.0|Some names from fiction stay in our minds - forever. Who can forget Scarlett O'Hara, Lolita, Heathcliffe, Holly Golightly, Bond, James Bond? Even if the author slips from our memory, their creations remain as solid as granite sculptures.<br /><br />If there is an exception, it has to be Ian Fleming - most likely because Mr Bond wasn't entirely imagined but stepped from the real life adventures of the author. Like 007, Fleming was a Royal Navy commander. With this as his starting point, author Damian Stevenson brings us `Operation Armada,' an adventure based on Fleming's experiences in navy intelligence during the Second World War.<br /><br />In what is projected as the first story from `The Fleming Files,' our true-life hero, code name 17F, drops at night by parachute with enough gold bullion to buy a fleet of ships from the French Navy to prevent them falling into German hands prior to the planned 1940 invasion of Britain. With a smorgasbord of larger than life villains, more double-crosses than turns in a spiral staircase and the de rigueur charms of femme fatale Denise Astier, we speed as if behind the wheel of a Bentley re-calibrated by M through a page-turning narrative that will leave readers excited for a fresh dip into the Fleming Files.<br /><br />For those who couldn't remember the authors of the books listed above they are: Margaret Mitchell, Vladimir Nabokov, Emily Bronte, Truman Capote and Ian Fleming.

B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I had low expectations going into this. Reviews were very mixed and even before it was released people were hating on the casting of Tom Cruise in the lead role.

Solid performances all around and a interesting mystery. Easily worth a rent and I will definitely be purchasing the blu ray in the future.

B00CM96A60|2.0|I've been an Armin fan for a long time, and while I still love his live sets, this album was pretty disappointing. My main grievance is that the album is completely dominated by over-the-top emotional female vocals that really drown out the rest of the production.<br /><br />The title track &#34;Intense&#34; is interesting to say the least. It goes from a solo violin to trance to dubstep to a Daft Punk-esque section back to violin all in a short 7-minute period. It's a shame because I feel the amount of creativity expressed in the track could have been extended over then length of the whole album, but all of it squashed into such a short amount of time leaves the track feeling somewhat disjointed.<br /><br />For all of the creativity of &#34;Intense&#34;, the rest of the album shows little variety. Belting dramatic vocals about lost-love have me skipping tracks to find the non-vocal tracks of which there are only a handful. The issue is compounded by the similarity of the vocalists chosen. &#34;Imagine&#34; mixed things up with the wispy voice of Audrey Gallagher against the more drama-filled deep vocals of Jaren and Sharon den Adel. &#34;Mirage&#34; threw in the sultry voice of Nadia Ali. In &#34;Intense, everyone just sounds like Laura V. Even Emma Hewwitt, whose voice I generally enjoy, is belting from the gut to the point where the cheese factor is just too much.<br /><br />For all the negatives, the instrumental tracks are classically Armin and enjoyable. The track &#34;This Is What It Feels Like&#34; is the best of the vocal tracks, although it is unfortunately clearly made for radio with 3:23 length. &#34;Intense&#34; may have some potential for decent remixes. I would pay money for a no-vox version. I hate to say it, but after &#34;Mirage&#34; was just okay, and this album was pretty rough, I'll be doing a bit more research before I buy his next album instead of buying on faith.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|I had some doubts about True Blood. I hate the Twilight series and how there seems to be a overly large fanbase for vampire romance, but when I saw how popular this show was and also its critical acclaim, I decided to give it a try and see what the fuss was all about. It turns out it is actually a very good show! I like the fact how there is a cliffhanger in every episode so you always feel this need to watch another episode. You don't feel as though it's a chore watching through these episodes too because there are various subplots going on at the same time also. The cast is pretty fantastic and they play their roles effectively, and the dialogue can be laugh-out-loud hilarious (in a good way), especially with Terra. I like the horror genre also, and the show also mixes thriller/mystery elements effectively that make it such an entertaining watch. There are many twists throughout the show also, which are often highly unpredictable. The cast gives off subtle comedy performances also that add to the show, giving it a nice twist. The only problem I have with the show is that I think the actress who plays Sookie was horribly miscast. Sure, she can put on a Southern accent, but she shows one-dimensional characteristics in her acting and she can't get angry or emotional in a convincing manner. I don't know. Maybe in later seasons she'll improve but we'll have to see.<br /><br />WATCH THIS SHOW NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T!

076421120X|5.0|This Devotional is designed that each day equals a page and each page begins with a small portion of the Bible. Not more than one or two verses. The idea is not to get as much information as possible, but to thoroughly mull over what you have read. After the Bible verse, Darlene spends a couple paragraphs telling us her thoughts and revelations about that portion of Scripture and finishes with a prayer to start us off in our own conversation with Jesus. Actually, this book's title is a bit of a misnomer because, although Darlene does reveal much about Jesus, what she does most is lead us to Jesus, where he reveals himself.<br /><br />Darlene's approach to the Bible is both interesting and unique, (who spends days delving into the book of Philemon?!). She demonstrated her extensive knowledge of the Bible by telling the events surrounding the writing of the verse and helped me to consider the feelings of the writer: the one holding the pen and the One inspiring the words.<br /><br />Although the Daily Devotional format is pretty much what we're used to, I found the content unexpected. Instead of a moment to pause and reflect, Darlene Zschech helped me to rethink my own prejudices about Jesus and be ready to accept him just as he is and for whomever he is. By giving me new things to think about, her words lingered and resurfaced throughout the day (and many times long beyond that). By bringing Jesus to my attention in such a enduring way, it allowed me to notice that he is interacting with me in ways and places I hadn't previously noticed. We may put her book down after the daily reading, but the revealing of Jesus continues.<br /><br />It's obvious through her writing that Darlene's own relationship with Jesus is an intimate one. She can express his majesty and might and at the same time his tenderness and availability. Our days that are filled with a million annoyances and sometimes huge painful events can feel like we are walking in a barren world. Like nomadic desert dwellers. But this devotional is more than a stop at the oasis. By revealing Jesus, Darlene puts us in the same place as the woman at the well, who met Jesus in a moment when they were both tired and alone. But once THAT woman understood who Jesus was and what he was offering, she never thirsted again. So be prepared, because once Jesus is revealed TO you, it's inevitable that he'll be revealed THROUGH you.rt dwellers. But this devotional is more than a stop at the oasis.

The reality and creativity in the natural setting where the film makes for a great series.  Also, the fact that they kill off key players keeps you always at the edge of your seat, knowing that one of your favorite characters could be gone!  Thanks for a series that as a person that does NOT watch shows has kept me wanting more.  Although, I couldn't bring myself to watch it on Easter Sunday the grand finale, for religious reasons I did pay to watch it at a later time.  Keep up the good work!!

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|You one-star reviewers are ridiculous, and stuck in the mediocre past. This movie is extraordinary. What JJ Abrams has done for Star Trek is what Nolan did for Batman—elevated a good template into greatness. It has very clever writing, great wit, great psychology, great humor, you name it. Its predecessor suffered from a weak villain, but the villain here is superb. I wish I had the Blu-ray now, cause once was not enough.

I've read some notes about a teal color in the picture, but I've seen VHS and DVD versions and I can't say I've seen that.<br />Of course, that isn't to say it isn't there, but anyways moving on..<br /><br />Sound, stellar. I'm not too familiar with the whole 5.1/7.1 sound thing, but I can say it definitely sounds better than the previous versions of the movie I've had.<br /><br />All in all, for the price you can't go wrong. Great action flick, great story and Linda Hamilton is in it (slight crush)...just..that 80's hair.. lol<br /><br />So yeah, give the movie a shot. I got this at $7.00 or so on Amazon, and for a Blu Ray that ain't bad!
B00C061I3K|5.0|Well, it finally arrived a couple days ago after pre-ordering and about a two-month wait. It's the newly released CD by Daft Punk called \\"Random Access Memories,\\" their first new album in eight years. If  you haven't yet heard of Daft Punk, and most people haven't, they're two French composers whose favored musical instrument is the computer and they've turned out some exquisitely good music. It takes a while to get hooked, but once you do you end up owning all their albums, as I have done, plus a few interesting videos.  \\"Random Access Memories\\" doesn't sound much like Daft Punk. Let's put it this way, if you listen to an early Ramones CD and the latest Ramones, they all sound alike except for the titles and lyrics changing. I happen to like the Ramones, I might add. However, if you listen to early Beatles and a late Beatles albums, they are so different that they are almost unrecognizable as the same group. Well, the Beatles were an extremely creative act, without question. Daft Punk is much the same way. They are two very creative musicians and their latest album sounds radically different from their earlier work. Some people may not like this. They may want Daft Punk to be Daft Punk over and over and they may thus be disappointed with this  fresh new album. In any case, I've been listening to the CD for a couple days now and it's time to write down a few thoughts for Amazon.<br /><br />First, this is a magnificent album. If, prior to listening to this recording, I had walked into a room and this CD was playing I doubt that I would have recognized that it was Daft Punk. However, my interest would certainly have been aroused as the music is outstanding. All the songs are excellent and I'm hard pressed to pick a favorite. Also, it's in a nicely arranged format. The songs flow easily from one to the next, so nicely that I'd say the best way to listen is to just sit down and listen to the entire album. It's real easy listening, although I hate that designation as applied to a musical genre. Easy Listening Music is dreadful!. No, I mean this CD is relaxed and melodic with wonderful vocals and some real catchy lines. I liked it at first listen and there was no period of adjustment. They call it Electronic Dance Music, but this CD is just head and shoulders above all other EDM albums, with the possible exceptions of a few deadmau5 CDs. It's just wonderful music, that's what it is. Other musical groups have these albums that propel them to the top, whether it's the Beatles or the Beach Boys and then the act remains at the top for a really extended period. Well \\"Random Access Memories\\" is that breakthrough album for Daft Punk. I have no data as yet, but I fully expect this album to rise to the top of the charts and to stay there for a while. Ultimately it will be considered a classic. Trust me on this. Congrats to all you Daft Punk fans. You're going to be hearing a lot of Daft Punk music well into the future.<br /><br />This album has had a lot of tender loving care. It shows. This is no quickie thrown on the market to rake in a little cash. This is a magnum opus and it's taken over five years of meticulous work to put it together. Everything is just right. I'm a bit of  an audiophile and I'd judge even the sound quality on this  CD to be better than on any of their previous CDs. Likewise, this is a new record label for Daft Punk. Maybe all these little things came together to produce this ideal album. One factor in maximizing the enjoyment of listening to this disc is your sound system. the recorded sound is excellent but you need a good sound system to appreciate it. I have a 100 Watt-per-Channel Stereo System with 7 speakers including two 12-inch woofers and a powered sub-woofer. At a fairly good volume, the sound is just awesome. I also have headphones for this system, but I prefer using the speakers as you can feel the sound in addition to hearing it. Mostly I use the headphones after the neighbors have come over to complain or late at night.<br /><br />Some people have labeled the music as retro. I can understand, but I don't think it's particularly relevant. Listen carefully and you hear distant echos of disco and small combo jazz. It's nice. Real nice. But this doesn't mean the music is disco or jazz any more than it's Electronic Dance Music. The music is somewhat similar to earlier Daft Punk offerings, but it's also drastically different. Listen carefully and you can follow the framework by computer much as with their earlier music, but they've added a lot more acoustical instruments such as piano, guitars and drums and a selection of wonderful vocals so that the end results sound significantly less like techno or EDM music. This music has a lush, elegant and dreamy sound, but it's still Daft Punk at the core. Let's not worry about what genre it best fits. It's just wonderful music. Let's leave it at that.<br /><br />Oh, one other thing. This CD has had an amazing amount of hype associated with it. I've noticed little articles all over the place, even in the Wall Street Journal, concerning Daft Punk's new album. Just yesterday, my latest issue of Rolling Stone Magazine arrived and a nice photo of Daft Punk was on the cover. My congrats to them for all this publicity, I think they earned it.<br /><br />Gary Petersonr late at night.<br /><br />Some people have labeled the music as retro.

B00CDFWJIG|4.0|Personally I can't stand the 1 star \\"I read the book first and the movie sucked\\" crowd. Get over it. Movies cannot flow like books and keep a audience's attention, and they certainly cannot do books justice in the time frame given. I guess if you read something and a movie comes out about it either get over the fact it will not do the book justice, or don't go see it. Either way spare us of your negative, biased, and unwarranted reviews.<br /><br />The story is original, and it is not just another Twilight. I have a wife and daughter who love the Twilight thing and I was forced to watch every one of them against my will. I would take this story over those any day.<br /><br />So for you who have not read the books.....watch the movie with an open mind and enjoy.

B001XUPH9K|5.0|Star Trek is the red headed step child to Star Wars. It's not even close. But Wrath of Khan rocks. If I am in the other room and hear<br />Chekov say &#34;They put Creatures in our bodies&#34; in that thick accent....I come running and i am glued to the TV the rest of the day. Mr Rourke flying around space battling Kirk...It's freaking awesome.

B007C7UZIG|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I love steam, but this app is terrible, I couldn't even log in. I even checked to make sure I was using correct password by checking computer. The only time it didn't have a problem with my password is when it couldn't verify my inhumanity. Then it would make me get a code, and I still couldn't log in. Don't download this, it is a waste of space and time.

B009NPA3MS|5.0|Good music and like that you can also listen on other devices too. You always own it even when you loose your CD.
1451627297|5.0|I read this novel with only a bare idea of what it might be about (someone said John F Kennedy's assassination). I found it facinating for the history (early 1960's) and the ideas and characters. Nothing like the gruesomeness of his other novels. There is one violent scene; other than that it is a story about people and history.<br /><br />I would suggest you read it without reading the jacket or anything else - it grabbed me from the first chapter.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book kept me on the edge and falling in love with the story and characters.  A must read for all!
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|Good storytelling. A very satisfying book for a rainy day or evening. If you like romantic classics you will like this.

B009VIZDLI|4.0|It is funny with great characterisation and an interesting plot. The progression of the story was hard to predict, so I wanted to read more all the time.
0307477479|3.0|My 3-star review is for the AUDIO version.  I listened to this book on Audible, as I do many books now.  The female who reads this book has a sweet, definitely feminine voice.  So, when she is reading the part of some of the male characters, her voice still sounds dellicately feminine and I could not tell the male characters from the female.  Her 'voices' for most of the other characters are great, but she does not have the range of male voices necessary to do this multi-character book justice.  This is surely a good read.  Just be sure you READ it, instead of listening to it. If you want a good listen, get THE ORPHAN MASTERS'S SON in audio or CD.  [[ASIN:0812982622 The Orphan Master's Son: A Novel (Pulitzer Prize for Fiction)]].
B000HT386M|5.0|This is one of the only Adam Sandler movies that I like. It is somewhat of a family/chick-flick, but it still gets to me every time. Great movie.
B005LAIH2M|1.0|The movie tries to hit you fast and hard, hoping that you won't notice how bad the story, characters and action really is. It gives you the facade of a stylistic action/adventure movie, but it's a boring knock-off of other movies - other bad movies.  For some reason, throughout the movie, it felt like it might of had potential for something cool - but it never delivers... just more of the same old garbage.  If you want to waste an hour and a half of your life watching this junk, go right ahead.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is such a steal. Such a fantastic cult classic. I love this movie. Kind of a twister, but exciting every time.

193700788X|3.0|I am a bit disappointed in this final Sookie book. As the FINAL book you figure it would be more exciting but it's just a lackluster ending to what used to be a great story. Glad I received as gift and didn't waste the money myself!

B002G1YPH0|5.0|This cooler is much much better then Intel-s liquid cooling system.  I put this cooler in my Powerfull workstation, on I7 Hexa extreme and it's do his job perfectly.<br /> Cons: It\s very big, you need wide enough case to put it there<br /> Pros: of course price, quality, performance, ..<br />This is a cheapest cooler for most power full CPU-s. I recommend it to all.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This is an emotional roller-coaster of a movie. If you want to laugh and cry, this is the film to watch.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really loved this story. You hoped it ended the way it did but it could have been something different.
B004LP3AYI|1.0|Review is not about the content of the book, but the lack of availability!<br />I've been seeing this message about unavailable content for about a month and a half; noted a review from 2011 with comments about missing content.<br />I am on the phone with Amazon CS about this right now. Of course have to get them to recognize that there is a problem first. She is now looking for the publishers phone number--while I hold. This is not something they appear to be able to research and update, but you have to remain on hold.<br />If this will get the book back for us all (I want to read too), then the time is well spent.<br />Crossing fingers.<br />Simon

B005NQ5LQ4|5.0|I was a fan of the first two Ip Man movies.  When I saw this one without Donnie Yen, I thought I'd give it a go.  While I may not have liked it quite as much as the others, I did particularly enjoy this one!  I especially like the fight scene with the old Chinese herbalist....!
B009AMANBA|5.0|I loved this movie.  Tommy Lee Jones, Daniel Day Lewis and Sally Fields were excellent in their roles.  Daniel Day Lewis was the most believable Lincoln I have seen so far.  The only thing I wish is that they had made this into a mini-series because I would like to have seen more of Lincoln's story played out by this crew.

B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|Only for devoted fans. Honestly i had to listen to it twice before I really started to dig it. Very different than there previous albums. A lots less of there Iconic Guitar rifts but Casablancas comes through with well developed lyrics and tight melodies. More on the Sythn Pop side and definityly connected with Casablancas solo album. The strokes are one of the great bands of the early 21st century dont miss out...
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|My wife wanted this CD and likes it alot. No regrets. Received in excellent condition and in a speedy amount of time.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|PROs<br />-Great value for the money.<br />-High DPI and very accurate.<br />-Great (customizable) weight and comfort.<br /><br />CONs<br />-Thumb buttons feel a little cheap. Could be remedied without increasing cost by using black and maybe adjusting the mold of the buttons (personal preference)<br />-Only the LED on the logo is customizable. Defeats the purpose of customizing LED if the rest of the colors are blue. Thought adjusting the color would affect all the lights.

0385349947|4.0|Sandberg's discussion of the ways in which women often shortchange themselves professionally has led to strong reactions.  Some have castigated her for blaming the victims in our still sexist society, while others have championed her call to arms to young (and not-so-young) women.  I was inclined to be in the former camp, but also realized that many people had formed their opinion without actually having read the book, and I refused to make that mistake.  Having now read the book, I am strongly in the second camp.  Sandberg is very careful to say repeatedly that she recognizes that there are many factors that hold women back, and that many, maybe even most of these, are beyond their control.  And she is also careful to say, again repeatedly, that she is not suggesting that all women need to become CEOs of major corporations, or even take other leadership positions:  she is respectful of women's--and men's--right to choose different paths.  But she provides what seems to me to be very good advice to women who do want to rise to leadership positions about how they can and should \\"lean in\\" to their goals, avoiding mistakes that come from internalizing the implicit biases against women.  My praise for this book is perhaps best captured in that fact that I am going to recommend it highly to my 25-year-old daughter.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Honestly I'm just writing this to get some interest coins, but it is a very good game and quite addictive. I would definitely recommend
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have to say I loved the book but didn't like the ending. It needed one more chapter. I will see the movie and hope the ending of the movie is just a little different.
B0058VW36U|5.0|as above, it's rare when you find a game that your young child can play and yet it is still quite challenging to an adult.<br />We are both stuck on the same level !!  I think it's awesome when a child is learning from such a fun game.<br />This is similar to Bad Piggies in that you have to continually figure out new ways to win each level.  (in this game) to get the little guy to eat.<br />It's physics!  and it's fun!
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love the show.  I like the 5th season. I still watch it when I feel like a laugh.  I am a Chemist and can relate with the &#34;nerd ness&#34; of the show.  Anyone growing up and taking math and chemistry classes no's to well what it is like.  As a woman it was worse.  The adding women scientists adds to the appeal.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|The reason I say it's not for young children is because a child needs to be able to read (and read well) to play this independently.  Nemo and his Dad do not speak when giving the player quests....the player must read what Nemo and Marlin say.  Otherwise it is a cute game.  You level up when you grow plants or rocks etc in the reef.  It's very colorful and you even can get Dori to come to your reef by setting up her Tiki Bar.<br />I got the game for my 5 year old but I play it for her bc she cannot play it independently.<br />She is happy to see that Mommy has gone up a level whenever she checks into the game.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|The whole movie was great. Denzel is always great in any role.  This one was no exception.  I would tell anyone it is worth watching.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This  is a super fun app that I got for free. I keeps me entertained for hours on end. This is appropriate for children of all ages and even adults.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Greater game for free. Even though a player has to purchase city credits to make the city run. It is a fun game to pass the time. Will recommend download if u are patient to sit back and watch your city grow.
B00BC24NT4|1.0|Mr. Le Carre has a definite style that you either seem to love or hate.  This time, I hated it and returned it after 50 pages.<br /><br />The action begins on a dark night in the British Crown Colony of Gibraltar, where &#34;Wildlife,&#34; a mysterious counter-intelligence operation, is underway. Christopher &#34;Kit&#34; Probyn, a decent midlevel civil servant who adores his wife and daughter, is surprised to find himself snatched out of his humdrum office job and assigned to serve as observer for a British Foreign Office minister who is running the action by remote control. At a critical moment, Kit's equipment shuts down, leaving him clueless. Afterward, he's told that &#34;Wildlife&#34; was a smashing success. He is sworn to secrecy, rewarded with promotion and honors, and goes back to his family, happy. When he retires, he begins questioning and embarks on a quest to find out what really happened on that fateful night.<br /><br />The reason I rated it one star:<br /><br />1.  The writing was very hard to follow -- I had to read paragraphs over and over to get the point.  A lot of work for something that is supposed to be entertaining.<br />2.  The character development -- I didn't find the protagonist, Kit, the least bit interesting.  I really wasn't engaged in his character at all -- bland and boring.<br />3.  Dialogue tended to by cryptic and mysterious -- I had to figure it all out and still wasn't interested.<br /><br />By page 54 or so, I hit the return button.  Just not my cup of tea.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I'm addicted to this show. The only this I don't like is how much Debra swears and how close she and Dexter are becoming, it's leaning towards incestuous and makes me feel uncomfortable.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|I've been a part of the Echelon family since A Beautiful Lie, and I have to say...I love this new album! I can understand, people don't like change. That's why Nickelback, Breaking Benjamin, etc. are played on the radio all day, everyday! BUT, I don't consider them talented musicians cause they don't challenge themselves to make a change. Some do make a change, but fail horribly (Kid Rock...perfect example).  That's why I love 30STM. Not one album of theirs sound exactly the same. This album was indeed a big change for the band, but they did awesome.
0739441671|4.0|I chose this rating because the service met my expectations. The item came intact and properly sealed. I've always enjoyed this type of novels.
0316776963|1.0|This was a book that I hated having paid for. I did not get the humor and am amazed at the rave reviews.  After reading a few chapters I had to let it go. The author rambled on about things that made me wonder if he was connected to reality. I have much better things to do with my time.

B002WV5A9G|1.0|First of all, Amazon's streaming was perfectly fine. That is not why I am giving this 1 star. I just thought this movie sucked. Spoilers Ahead.<br /><br />I love Star Trek - but this movie was just awful. J.J. Abrams, When your version of Star Trek is *less progressive* than the version from 1960s US television, then YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG. Not that Roddenberry's (original Trek creator) work was perfect in a social justice sense, but he really did try to promote a progressive vision of race and wrote some groundbreaking roles. He tried to push gender limits as well, with less success: the pilot version having a female officer as second in command, women in pants, etc. All changed for the series at the bequest of 1960s TV producers, but the seeds were certainly there.*<br /><br />It makes me really, really sad to see the series being ripped from those roots. J.J.'s version paints a picture of an atavistic, sexist future, where white men still hold all of the control, people of color play minor (and stereotyped) roles, and women are relegated to non-speaking roles, incompetence (or competence that is only alluded to, and never SHOWN), and mini-skirts.<br /><br />If you think I'm joking, consider the few women who actually have SPEAKING LINES in this movie. The three female characters of &#34;significance&#34; were insignificant — one gave birth, one was a mother, and one was a girlfriend. Another female with speaking lines was put on screen so Kirk could have sex with her. Great.<br /><br />Zoe Saldana had the biggest female part playing Lt. Uhura - a gifted linguistic specialist who discovers an important signal yet is relegated to window dressing.  Why couldn’t they give her something cool to do that showed off her skills? And why does Uhura have to bully Spock into giving her a position she is qualified to get? Yes, a communications officer rarely goes on away missions unless one is needed for some sticky piece of communications and the ability to coordinate messages both onboard ship and between ships is very important, especially in a combat situation. YET, in this film I feel like we were just told by the expository powers that be: “Uhura is really smart” without anything to back that up in action; the only job we got to see her do was nurse Spock who seems to have a rather striking number of mommy issues.<br /><br />Uhura being Spock’s lover is not inherently bad - what is disturbing is the fact that Spock doesn’t respect her and as an audience member you don’t get to see her do anything else. You know what would have made me happy? Instead of Kirk being an incredibly creepy voyeuristic- pervert and us hearing Uhura talk about how she did this really difficult piece of communications work, why not just have a scene showing us Uhura in action translating different strains of Klingon and Romulan communications? Isn’t that the old adage of story-telling, more show less tell? That scene would have been so cool. If I had seen that scene and then seen Spock assign her to the Enterprise without a blink and then watched her be all nurturer extraordinaire I would have loved this movie so much more, I would actually be excited and filled with hope at the prospect of a sequel (which was also terrible, by the way, but for different reasons). But no. J.J. Abrams decided it would be better if Kirk got it on with an Orion woman and then peeped in on Uhura innocently changing clothes. Lovely.<br /><br />The special effects and music were good, but special effects and music cannot carry a movie - especially whose beginnings were  rooted in social justice and enlightenment. Instead, we audience members just get the same old crap, wrapped up in some space-y special effects. I'd skip this one, if I were you.<br /><br />*And yes, I know the original Star Trek was sexist, but it wasn’t trying to be. It was trying to be enlightened, albeit failing miserably by modern standards. But the trying is what matters. The new Star Trekmovie is the first time in the history of the franchise that the Star Trek world is depicted as less enlightened than the present-day world.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Easy enjoyable read. I read it in two days. Surprisingly enjoyed it. Shorter than I expected. I will be reading the rest of the series.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Nice graphics, fun puzzles, good storyline. My only complaint is that I had to pay more money to unlock the complete game.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Cool game nice graphics keeps you busy I play on my kindle HD fire I usually like tap games but this is a good  change up
B008966SIU|5.0|I adored Veckatimest, so I'm not sure why I hadn't already pre-ordered this guy as soon as it was announced. When I did finally make a point to get it, I had some trouble getting into it. I have a much easier time listening to fast-paced music when my attention is elsewhere, so it wasn't til I was listening to \\"Yet Again\\" that this album took my breath away. After that, something clicked and I wanted to listen straight through, on repeat.<br />This is definitely a beautiful album, especially thanks to songs like \\"Sleeping Ute,\\" \\"Speak in Rounds,\\" \\"Yet Again,\\" and \\"gun-shy.\\"
B000KX0HVY|5.0|Looking for CD to replace my 8-track & cassette audio tapes. The stores told me CD's were a thing from the past. Everyone downloads their music now. So I turned to Amazon to find my favorite music on CD.I couldn't have been more delighted ! I found EXACTLY what I'd been searching for. It was priced below my expectations & arrived in such a short time. When I mistakenly assumed my purchase qualified for free shipping Amazon made me a satisfied customer by crediting my account. I could'nt be more satisfied with my CD, \\" Essentially Elvis\\" ! I've never been dissappointed with any of my Amazon purchases.
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|I'd been waiting for this album to be released since I listened to their \\"I'm Sorry..\\" EP about a year ago. I still prefer the version of \\"Female Robbery\\" I had originally, but that aside, this album didn't disappoint me (and I had high hopes).<br />For me, highlights from the album are:<br />\\"Afraid\\"- haven't been able to get it out of my head; \\"Sweater Weather\\" I've been obsessed with for a while anyway; \\"Let It Go\\"- glad it made the album! it's fun to sing along to; \\"Alleyways\\" and \\"Staying Up\\" are quickly becoming new favorites also.<br />Can't decide if the CD is worth the money? I'd start with those.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|But after a while it's just the same old thing I don't play it as much as I use to.
B00C4U9U4Q|5.0|OK. I have to admit, I'm not sure if this album deserves all 5 stars. I think if I was 5 or 10 years older, or hadn't been listening to her music for a while, I might not be as obsessed with this album as I am. However, it is what it is, and I've been listening to it constantly since I got it. I'd been waiting for it since I first heard Nuclear Seasons, since I kept replaying live youtube videos of Stay Away (cannot even express how glad I am it made the album!) and Wires, since the singles for You're the One and You (Ha Ha Ha) were released.<br /><br />I love all these songs, with the exception of Cloud Aura (which still confuses me) and Set Me Free (Feel My Pain). The latter I don't listen to much mostly because it reminds me of Portugal. the Man. I'm still not sure how I feel about that.<br /><br />Standouts on the album for me? Nuclear Seasons, You're the One, You (Ha Ha Ha): no surprise.  Stay Away: I believe I've already mentioned how I adore this song, but in case you missed it? Love.  How Can I: nice and dark, catchy, plus swearing- everything I've come to love in a Charli XCX song!  Take My Hand, Lock You Up: both catchy and full of energy, on the positive end of the relationship spectrum.  So Far Away, Black Roses: opposite end of that spectrum, but no less awesome!<br /><br />Get it.

B003L7DK74|5.0|Flight of the conchords is one of my absolute favorite shows of all time & as such this box set is naturally superb, my only real complaint is that there were only two seasons of the show because I feel the show being only 22 episodes never really got to reach its full potential. That said this is a must own for any Conchords fan!
B001DM3Q2S|5.0|Like The Story line and the movie,, they did a great job in making this, and what I always like is a nice twist at the end
B007V4530A|3.0|Good, solid advise on presenting a good talk to any audience. TED talks imply something special is to be delivered, so perhaps the re3view of fundamental speech writing is a good thing.

B0049GYXHC|5.0|Love these CGI Movies kids love it and even adults will find it pretty funny too, great story and voice arrangements
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautiful story / stories. I curiously read the entire book within a 24 hour period!  I love the way that there are many stories woven into one beautiful story. Most importantly that the author was able to delve into the realities of each of the different characters. He is very insightful into the thoughts and rational that people have when they make their life choices. I've never highlighted as many notes as I did in this book. Mr Hosseini is an amazingly talented writer and observer of the human spirit. I've read all of his books now and love them all.  This book was no exception. It's a must read for everyone.
B000HT3JNY|5.0|Another movie that tells you be very careful what you wish for, has a serious side, but still pretty funny
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This book was very entertaining, with a good bit of humor in it.  It was a fairly fast read but more because it was interest ing than because it was like a Danielle Steele-like book that tend to be alike.
B0037QGS0K|5.0|always becareful what you ask for, they did a great job on making this flick I would recommend it to any one
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|The subject, was vast, and in this almost three hours, lives, karma, continuation, and consequences all played out, sometime not so nice a few as others, yet the truth is there.  I would recommend it for. Consideration.<br />To open ideas and just enjoy the many roles.

B0098VXBIA|5.0|First of all, it is definitely a chick flick. The film shows the various types of women and I think it does a great job of exploring our crazy conflicting emotions.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great time passer a lol mind has to be used but other than that it's fun &amp; most of all it's FREE my favorite kind of games
B009JBZH54|5.0|It came in when expected and I gave it as a gift to my brother. We both love this trilogy so I feel that it was a good investment
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I grew up watching Christopher Reeve as Superman and he will always be the one and only Superman as far as I'm concerned no matter how good CGI becomes, and Margot Kidder, hubba-hubba. I also used to think it was a little strange how the first Superman movie was a masterpiece of comic book superhero genre and the following three movies really missed the mark, not anymore thanks to the Richard Donner Cut. It was like getting a do over for me now there are two Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder Superman movie masterpieces and I can see that had Richard Donner remained the director there would have been four. Thank you Richard Donner.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|I got this as a gift for my boyfriend because he loves Shinedown. When he got it that was all he would listen to for 2 weeks straight! Definitely a good investment.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Great read following the first book, however too many unanswered questions at the end, leaves you wanting more...more. Can't wait to continue with the third ok installment.
B00A757EFW|2.0|This is a fun game, but because it is a free app, it will not save a high score, so you can't move to different levels, or indicate your high score. It is better to buy the &#34;paid&#34; version so you can progress on the game!
B009NY43NY|5.0|Spoiler Alerts ---  O.K. - First let say I started this book with some preconceived notions that it would be awful, based on the reviews I had read - but being a Sookie Stackhouse fan I had to buy the book and I am glad I did.  I also listened to the book from an Audible download, so I don't know if that made the difference, but in any event I enjoyed the book.<br /><br /> I read the comments about the characters not being true to form and I disagree only because it's fiction - the characters can be whatever Charlaine Harris wants them to be.  Let me clarify that I am not an obsessed fan; just an avid reader of the books.  Books by the way about people who turn into panthers, wolves, lions and let us not forget the array of vampires, faeries and demon characters - in other words, fiction.<br /><br />Some reviewers said the plot was contrived, but really...which one of these books didn't have weird plots?  Somewhere I read this is the last book of the series and I thought it ended well, wrapped up any loose ends and leaves us thinking that Sookie will have a Happy Ever After future - and that suits me just fine.  Did I want it to end with her giving her heart to a dead person, growing old without children and being dumped when her body and face got too wrinkly for the ageless Eric?  Heck no. It ended in a way that left Sookie \\"normal\\" and strong.<br /><br />I would recommend this book and an enjoyable quick read.
B00BMVTS1S|4.0|kinda annoyed it didn't finish the movie, but i guess they gotta make money off us.<br /><br />nice quality, felt like i was in theaters...minus the being alone at home part lol
B000AGTPUK|5.0|Amazing animation.  I enjoyed watching this movie with my Grandson; especially when the hot chocolate was served on the train.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|I admit, I am a fan of this band, since the debut album. Each release brings something new to the sound, as it should. This release is again, different. Some die hard fans or fans that have heard other albums may not like it, but that's okay. For me personally, the last time I had a song affect me so viscerally was the opening bars of Phantom of the Opera. Even my mother, who hates my taste in music, was dancing and singing around and wants me to put this CD on her Ipod. There is a lot of synth but I believe it fits, and each song evokes a different emotion, which I think is a lofty goal for most releases that fall short. This one does not.<br /><br />A lot of reviews mention the \\"oh ohs\\" that are included to make it great for arenas and live shows. Again, if you look back, MANY of their songs from past albums have included this. They are a band that shines live. Leto's voice is superb, it seems to get better with every release. The drums, the synth, the piano, the vocals....all combine to make an explosive, epic album that fans and newbies won't want to miss.<br /><br />It's not for everyone, no, but for those that understand progression and growing with each release, this is a satisfying addition to 30 Seconds to Mar's repertoire.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|It was ok.  It was dark.  The lead character is a drunk who killed a rapist in cold blood and is then used by the mayor to carry out despicable deeds.  He finally comes to his senses and takes down the mayor and goes to jail for murder.  The females in this movie are there for &#34;eye&#34; candy only.

B005ZMUXDC|5.0|This movie is one of our favorites!  We absolutely love this movie.  We can watch this over and over again:-)
B005CWRB44|5.0|I purchased this flashlight and the 4sevens ML at the same time.. The Fenix was $10 cheaper and I like it better.  They were both the same size and per the specs the 4sevens had an additional 10 lumens in power.  However in the real world this flashlight had a much more even an useable spread of light.  Also the low setting is just a bit brighter and much more functional in my opinion.  I could not tell a real difference in &#34;brightness&#34; on the full setting between the two. The 4sevens ML does have a strobe function if that is important to you. It is also smoother twisting on/off.<br /><br />One other interesting difference is in the three settings.  Fenix is Med/Low/High while 4sevens is Low/Med/High.  I appreciate going straight to Med on the Fenix as 80% of the time that is the setting you want anyway.<br /><br />I am amazed at how bright this light is given it's tiny dimensions.  As bright as a giant Maglight from back in the day.  Also a great value. I saw larger lights claiming 80 lumens or so at big box stores for more money.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Every movie by the Kendrick brothers has gotten better and better.  The story lines in this movie really hit home with the culture of today.  I especially liked how the men chose to stay in the lives of the characters who made a poor choice by discipling them.  The movie is mixed with sorrow and laughter.  I've watched it over and over.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Accuweather seams to give pretty good forecasts.  The app is really a link to there mobile web page but it works as such.  I do find that it is hard to slide the toggle from static to animated for the radar which I wish they would fix.
1609611543|5.0|Dr. William Davis explains, in scientific detail, why processed foods are addictive and how today's versions of wheat connect to the exploding obesity epidemic.  Read it and form your own opinion.<br /><br />It is not fun being a fat vegetarian, and I have been for most of the last 20 years.  The frankenfood vegetarian options that have flooded mainstream stores (I'm not talking about products from Amy's Kitchen or other organic, more expensive options...think Kellogg's Morningstar brand stuff and Boca) have gluten as the main meat-alternative ingredient.  No wonder I've struggled with sugar and pizza cravings as my constant companions.<br /><br />I decided to remove wheat flour products from my diet and within two weeks my sugar and pizza cravings finally abated; I felt &#34;normal,&#34; and that's HUGE for me.  For YEARS I've been the kind of person who refused a piece of birthday cake at a gathering, trying to stay on my food plan, only to succumb to the obsessive thoughts of the sweet treat later that day or the next.<br /><br />Big Food processing companies and their decades-long efforts to produce mass quantities of cheap, easy-to-hull, disease-resistant wheat have cultivated (pardon the pun) an environment of cheap, minimal-nutrition, shelf-stable products that somehow pass for food.  60 years ago, cheapo junk food wasn't a constant companion like it is today.  And today people are blamed for not having the sense to eat these processed foods in moderation<br /><br />I thought I'd be more angry at the Big Food companies, but after reading this book, I'd like to think the addictive properties of the hybrid wheat strains they created wasn't part of their master plan to produce more wheat faster, cheaper, and better.  HOWEVER, I am extremely angry at the medical community for continuing to group-think if a patient doesn't have classic celiac symptoms, the patient could not possibly have an allergy to wheat; therefore, no food allergy tests are needed.  All patients with a prolonged history of obesity should be tested for food allergies and - at the very least - the discussion of removing wheat from the diet for a month should be offered.  (Wait, that would require they get schooled-up on food as a medicinal means to heal the body.  Dumb me for suggesting it.)

1400069289|3.0|This book provides great insights about forming habits and how they are important. However, I found the structure of the book a little annoying. Starts one anecdote and in the middle of it, begins another. Sometimes as many as three different examples going on at once...seems like this book is written for (or by) someone with severe A.D.D.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book is like the  survivorman tv show- except our protagonist is stranded on mars. The stranded man shows inhuman amount of poise, resourcefulness, and ingenuity. I do not know if the science expounded in this book is feasible or not. But it is a very good book and quite enjoyable. Surprised it has been under the radar in terms of publicity.
B0071MQ37E|5.0|I have seen twice a live performance of the Phantom, first was in late 1990s in Chicago, and second last year in NY. Each time I liked it and indeed a live performance cannot be entirely replaced by a recorded one. However, just as one reviewer said before me, this is the closest thing to the live performance. And has one big advantage in fact: I can play it as often as I want and review the parts that I like the most, and my 9 year old daughter can listen to it as much as she wants and sing along. We purchased the digital version and whenever I am connected to Internet I can listen a little bit here and there. Sierra Boggess and Ramin Karimloo have beautiful voices and a great performance. This specific performance has the advantage of the Anniversary \\"special\\" which includes a wonderful \\"second\\" part with Sarah Brightman and former \\"phantom\\" singers, icluding briefly Michael Crawford. Having the digital version in my digital library makes it easy for me to play it at work at the end of the day for 5- 10 minutes while I complete some paper work, and makes me feel better and happier, just like some magic touched my day.

B004RJMUJO|1.0|I've heard a lot about this game. Jumped on it as the FAotD. Then I saw the permissions required as it started up its installer.<br /><br />UM, NOPE. I cancelled the install. I can't believe this is a paid app. People have paid to have a game steal their information. Greediness and misbehavior has apparently become the norm with advertisers and developers. What a disappointment that, of all the potential that the Internet and smartphones have, this is how we choose to utilize them.
B009FZFONO|1.0|TWD Season 1 & 2 were great, enough to keep my interest and keep me on my toes. But season 3 started with such a great story and turned it over on itself. I have never been more disappointed in TWD or any TV show for that matter. Clear and Hounded were the best episodes of this season, they were a few of the only episodes in the entire season that focused on character depth and development, which by the way, is what The Walking Dead is supposed to be about.<br /><br />AMC and Mazzara, you F'd this awesome show up big time.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|I felt like I knew the characters. The story had a few twists to the plot which I liked. I want to know what happens to the characters in a few years.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I didnt expect season 2 to be as good as season 1. But man was I wrong, It has kept the fire burning just as strong and has not let me down EVER.<br /><br />Best Show I have ever seen.
B002VT6C0K|5.0|Each story seems like a normal mundane setting and then either a sinister third party comes in or just something unexpected and upsetting happens.  Stories punch a big impact and stay with you.  Beautifully written but each and every one ends on a down note.  Especially story with the girl trying to avoid the other girl who is slow and in special classes.  The ending was disturbing and couldn't imagine something like that would happen but within the story believable.  The stories are so well written and completely engrossing.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I am huge into movies and tv shows. I watch more hours of them then almost anything else. So sure enough I have high expectations and dont waste my time with bad acting, stupid dialog, uninteresting story, little character depth, or cheesy TV shows and movies.<br /><br />This show, took every one of those elements up there and turned them upside down. I have never been more impressed with a tv show, the acting is perfect. The dialog is brilliant, the story is gripping, the character depth is unbelievable and the lack of cheese makes this show easily my favorite. Breaking Bad, I am sorry, but you have been relieved of position number 1.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Just loved this book.  The idea of Lincoln's greatness coming from his kindness, his willingness to forgive, his patience and his genius which never was used to make anyone feel that he was inferior.  The love people felt for him was overwhelming and so thoroughly portrayed in the book that I felt it as well.  A beautiful man portrayed lovingly in the book.  A must read.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not quite as good as the first but still a good read.  Looking forward to the final book to see how it ends.

159562015X|4.0|I think this book is very good, but I'm not sure I agree with everything in it. I didn't realized when I bought it, there is a test you can take to determine your strengths. Since the book was &#34;like new&#34;, the code was used, and since I had to take the test as part of a school assignment, I had to go to the website and pay $19.95 to take the test. I could have bought the book new at a book store for $14. As far as the book and test, I recommend it.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Follows the book quite closely. I was a little disappointed when it ended and can't wait for the next part to come out on DVD!
B0009P5YXO|4.0|When I got this I was super psyched, though I've had trouble replacing the batteries, you kind of have to pry them out of the screwdriver and hope nothing brakes. The button that extends the screwdriver falls off almost every time you use  it, but it snaps in place easily so it's not too annoying. Sometimes the light glitches, but in my opinion it makes the screwdriver cooler. Overall it's super fun, and you'll  go sonicing every where, something's could be a lot better, but I think it's really really fun.

B0044WSF5M|4.0|I've seen this film at least once before, but last night was the first time that I saw it in widescreen HD.  And I surely wasn't disappointed; the digital transfer was pretty good for an older film.  I will admit that the audio was lacking, however.  I believe it was presented in it's original mono, and a good surround sound remix surely would have helped the audience to better understand the dialog.<br /><br />One thing that I'm unsure of:  is this film an authentic representation of American teenage life in the early 60s, as the synopsis suggests?  (When I first started watching I believed it was supposed to be the late 50s, but worrying about a year or two would surely be splitting hairs.)  I was born in the early 60s but wasn't a teenager until the late 70s, so I surely wouldn't know.<br /><br />But while watching I actually didn't much care about authenticity.  To me the film was a really good ride, just like it must have been with all the young actors in this film as they cruised up and down the streets of Somewhere, California.  And there were so many actors in this film that went onto -- or already had -- great careers:  Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, Cindy Williams, etc.  But I was really surprised to see Mackenzie Phillips in this film.  I'll have to admit, I wasn't much of a fan of her work in \\"One Day at a Time,\\" but I thought she was perfect here.<br /><br />One actor that to me got too much play, in more ways than one:  Wolfman Jack.  Sure, I remember him as a kid.  But his gravelly voice seems to grind on and on, especially towards the end, and I thought that George Lucas should have perhaps edited some of that out.<br /><br />But still, a fun movie about surely a better time.  Or a time that you might remember as being better.  After all, I wasn't old enough to remember much of any of it.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is the best car game you can find it is also free one of the things I like about it is when you get gas it feels you all the way up I hope  get it and have as much fun as me
B001NA6096|2.0|I found the characters to be very shallow, especially Ethan Hawke's character. I know that one night doesn't allow for much character development, but I couldn't find any reason to care about the characters or empathize with them.
B00000JNO1|3.0|I LOVE Lynyrd Skynyrd! I was looking for the original Nuthin' Fancy, this one isn't the original.......BUT, I did not read it good when I ordered it, so it is my fault. It's ok, but not as good as the original one.
B00BMEF8UA|5.0|I am not one to really give reviews of albums.  However, this CD/DVD set is nothing short of amazing! Anything less than a 5 star rating is criminal.  Iced Earth has been my favorite band since I first discovered them in 1999.  I have always preferred Matt Barlow as IE's front man.  But Stu Bloc has propelled IE to a whole new level with Dystopia and this concert set.  If you are just discovering IE I would personally recommend this CD/DVD set, Something Wicked and Horror Show from the band's catalog to start with.  If you are a long time fan and don't have this one yet, GET IT!  Once again Iced Earth delivers what true metal is all about.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game looks stupid but its really fun and you can ride in tanks and stuff dirt bikes fourwhelers monster trucks and stuff like that
B002XMGGJM|5.0|There is a lot of violence in this movie, but the frustration the average citizen feels with the imperfect legal and legislative systems is very clear here.
1594204217|2.0|Look, I enjoyed \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" and I enjoy listening to his interviews - primarily on NPR, but this book is dense, like text book dense, and highly self-serving. Sadly, can not recommend.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|wonderfully told story of such sadness.  the songs are really great.  wish i could watch it over and over but i think that i'd fall into some serious depression.  best film adaptation yet!
B005LAIIHG|4.0|This was a surprise, not at all what I was expecting from the commercials but it was very interesting. I would not recomend it for children. I have watched it twice.
B00BIK06JG|5.0|finally got the case. Wonderful addition to the HX 300. Excellent product. Easy to use. Open the velcro cover and the camera is exposed. Slip your hand into the grip and start taking pictures. Couldn't be easier. Also can be used with tripod with out removing the case.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|There was too many hidden object games and not enough mystery to the game.  If you like just search for objects than this is a game for you. I prefer more mystery in my games.  The mini games were challenging.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|this game is ok not good creator can add some small things and he can make it good . this game does'nt make my mind fresh after playing it , irritates me ..
B00B2V66VS|3.0|so whenever I press on the app to play , it will do the screen that's loading and then everything turns black and goes back to the home screen. I really would like it if you would fix it now!

B005S9EKCW|5.0|Saw it in the theater, had to have to movie. Cry every time I see it, it is just so rich in every way!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Excellent story!  This is the first book of William Landay's that I have read, and after this, will definitely read the others.  The story, as a parent, makes you reach deep down and wonder what you would do if you were to find yourself in this horrible situation.  The secondary characters, Billy Barber and Jonathan Klein were also excellent!  Only start this book if you have nothing else to do cause I guarantee you won't put it down!

B009AMAGXK|5.0|I was very excited to see this movie ever since the trailers. However I was scared going in to see it back in February. However the movie was very fun. Yes I enjoy the Twilight movies, yes i know they are what they are, but this movie had much better writing (Screenplay) and acting. All the actors are charming in this movie, and you can tell how much fun they are all having. The sets and directing are very well done and the movie is produced very well. The movie is a romance, but it isn't overly cheesy, the actors had great chemistry. No I did not read the book, but there was not a moment in this movie that I was not enjoying it. I recommend this movie to anyone, it is not just for females. It is great fun and it's a shame that no one appreciated this movie when it was released in theaters.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I like when you set the time and save,  it tells you how many hours you have to sleep,  which then lets me know if I set it a week from now instead of 10 hours from now,  yeah I need a lot of sleep. Also I like to  waken softly so it can start nice and quiet and it does get quite loud.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|Very upset that I could not create ANYTHING! All I could do was change a character. I'm just glad it was only a dollar. If you have a kindel fire do not buy this app. I really would have enjoyed this app but thanks to the creators of this app I can't.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It is different than most of the games that I play on the Kindle.  Quite a challenging change of pace.
B004SI12CU|1.0|I found the writing poor and the story worse.  I recommended this to my book club and the meeting was cancelled.
B008220BLG|5.0|This film was my all time favorite during the limited time it was shown in theaters here. I must have gone to see it at least 9 times. The characters are so true to the story that Issac Marion put forth in the original novel that the film is based on. Warm Bodies gives you everything you would want from a film. The horror, suspense, the intense emotional rollercoaster, and the hilarity that you've only seen before in Shaun of the Dead. The actors that portrayed the leading roles are just perfect and spot on for the film. Nicholas Hoult that played \\"R\\" gave him all the heart and soul, that a real zombie may have lacked. While Teresa was able to embody the same kick ass attitude we expect from someone so capable of taking a leading lady role and running it like it should be. She showed in The Sorcerers Apprentice, I Am Number Four, and now Warm Bodies that she can play dual roles as the tough down to business chick as well as the warrior half and then the tentative love interest even when the guy is dead. I'm ashamed to say that while writing this I've unfortunately forgotten the name of the actor that portrays Marcus but his comedic timing is unforgettable. The scene at the airport lounge where they decide to...nope...just check the film out to be sure. Its going to be one of my favorites and will always find a spot on my TO WATCH list of classics in the genre.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|one of the big draws of this game is the grind: leveling up your shark and unlocking new ones is the a major incentive to continue playing. so when the game regularly erases play progress for no apparent reason, it kills the fun of playing. the game also seems to suffer from some object permanence issues: several times I have pursued a fish or turtle only for them to vanish when I reach the edge of the sea. sometimes fish appear from nowhere as well. the game freezes a little too often as well. despite the need to constantly recalibrate once you shift your position, the core gameplay mechanic is solid. it's just these bugs that make HSE hard to enjoy fully.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is thought provoking about society and human nature. The characters are interesting and multi dimensional. I can't wait to read something else by this author.
B00004CY38|1.0|I tried to hear you respond back about your product that I couldn't play and no responded!!!!!!!! I would not buy your this buyer again!!!!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|THis movie turned out to be an awesome experience, best movie I have seen since Danny Boyle's &#34;Sunshine&#34;.  Visually mesmerizing...
0316224588|2.0|Novel starts out fairly well, then quickly degenerates. Plot lines peter out or simply get lost, secondary characters are undeveloped, and the overall resolution is less than believable,
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Freezes and kicks you out when you win something! Takes too many credits to play one round. Would never pay to play this game!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|The idea and the plot moving the story is pretty fascinating. However, the tedious description kills the story  and slows down the plot. The characters are poorly developed except for Julie shown as the only creative and  vigorous person. To finish the book, I had to skip a bunch of pages to be able to follow and enjoy the plot. The idea behind the plot is depressing to say the least, quite a morbid story without any hope of a better life.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|No problems or issues, works great, found it easy to use and understand. Has a good many of useful features met my expectations.
B009XTF8KQ|4.0|THE POSSESSION<br /><br />This movie had two things going for to gain my interest, the first was that Sam Raimi and company produced it. Then of course there is the obvious reason which is that it is an exorcism movie. That is two reason and good enough reasons for me to this. So when I eventually got around to checking it out I have to say that I was pleased with my viewing experience.<br /><br />A divorced couple is trying hard to get along and do right by their daughters, sharing custody. The father takes his daughters one day and happens upon a yard sell; the owners of the house may or may not have just been involved in something dark. While there the youngest comes across a box that catches her fancy. Of course daddy wants to make her happy so he buys it for her. Everything is fine until they get to the new house that their father has gotten. That night things start to go bump in the night and strange things happen time after time. The youngest daughter seems to be the only one affected and it is driving the family even further apart. But she may be in serious danger as something dark and old may be lurking inside her newly found box.<br /><br />This film is based on a true story about a thing called the Dybbuk Box, which is a wine cabinet that supposedly houses an evil spirit. This is all based on Jewish legend which of course plays heavily in the film, refreshing new spin on the usually Catholic exorcism flick. I have heard of this before and a Dybbuk has been mention or used in films previous to this. Any way this movie is based on the box that was involved in the e-bay story. You should research this further if interested. I know that it has been the subject of a few TV shows including \\"Paranormal Witness\\" I believe.<br /><br />I have to say that director Ole Bornedal really knows what he is doing. The atmosphere that he creates in this film is great and may be the best thing about the film. Of course the writers deserve credit here as they adapted the story of what really happened into this film. There were some big changes if you watch the special features like the real story feature or listen to the 2 great commentaries. Also I loved the performances here but the show stealer was probably Natasha Callis, the youngest of the kids. She is wonderful here but so is everyone else if that wasn't clear from my previous sentence. Also I liked musician Matisyahu here, I actually had no idea he was in it until he popped up.<br /><br />This movie had some creepy moments in it but it was not over done which makes it a watchable film for younger viewers in my opinion. Also the DVD comes with those bonus features I mentioned earlier among others so it is a good purchase. I do recommend this film to any horror or exorcism movie fan. Maybe a night featuring this, \\"The Innkeepers\\", \\"Sinister\\", \\"Mama\\" and \\"The Woman in black\\" is in my near future. All films I liked that I could easily watch again.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|Too many plots to be handled in one book and must he always kill a key character to end a book in suspense?  Not sure this story will ever end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is the best game everrr it is too addicting<br />Even though it's a copy of temple run<br />Y'all need to play this like u'll never forget it<br />JUST TOO MUCH ADDICTING
B004NELBPC|3.0|While the Drudge Report is underdesigned; this app is over-designed.  Photos headlines are too large and awkward.  Take a look at CNN, NBC, USA Today for how to do this better.  Content is OK; but it's a cumbersome app.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best  game  ever at first I thought it was dum until I got it now I think its one of the best games ever made
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There are few books that make me cry after a second reading, but just about every John Green book pulls at your heart. I'm picky about my favorite novels, but I knew this one was on my list within a few pages.<br />Buy it. Read it. Share it.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|A great, great story with a tremendous message for all fathers.  This movie should be required viewing every Father's Day, year after year.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A complicated story that just kept on getting more compicated.The characters kept me interested and the ending was a little strange.
B00C061I3K|2.0|Whole generations of people nostalgic for music and pop-culture they were never part of.<br />Ever since the end of the 80's, music just keeps recycling with hybrids of sub-genres from the past.<br /><br />Is pop music played out?<br /><br />Is there nothing new that can be created?<br /><br />Is creativity lost on instant gratification and technology?
B003JTHXOK|3.0|The book started out great and was very captivating, making you feel like you know all the characters and are bonded to them emotionally. Sparks writes the book from many viewpoints and it draws you even further into the characters. My only complaint was that the middle was a little slow and void of action, making me wish I could read faster to get to the exciting parts!
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is a must read...it has it all!  I legit laughed out loud many times, Drew is a funny guy...a bit of an egomaniac but truthful and swoon worthy.  Kate is his perfect fit, but she's not like any other women Drew has met...he has to work for this one and it baffles him completely. He does well in his attempts but his hilarious commentary make this story stand out from all the rest.<br /><br />The author must have a wicked sense of humor and I'm so looking forward to more from her!!
B005G4TJUC|5.0|A great movie! Everyone should own this movie...<br /><br />Great plot, story line, actors and the whole works were amazing! Must see!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|The new version, with Glacier Park, adds constant messages asking to merge to \\"your Facebook account\\".  The messages are irritating and obnoxious.  It doesn't appear to be any way to delete the \\"mail\\".
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I don't know what really to say besides it's a Facebook app.<br /><br />It does glitch about once a day and stops working but the apps for other devices do the same thing so I think it is on Facebooks side that those issues should be fixed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this Solitaire game because it's very easy to understand and it's been<br />around for so long. I don't understand the newer versions of solitaire and don't<br />want to. I love the price for this app and I recommend it highly!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Holy wow!! I loved this story the whole way thru! Abby & Travis deserve each other! I wish there was a lot more to their story tho!!
1451695195|5.0|One of the reasons that I bought this one is that I saw a program on television with this doctor, and this experience coming from a surgeon compels you to want to read about his experience with the afterlife. I haven't gotten around to reading it yet, but will soon, then I will give a review
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I wanted to slap Ana so hard for being a whiny little girl and tell her to man up buttercup that she was asking for this but I was sucked into what I could see coming from these books and this story.<br /><br />I will read this book again!
1623420148|5.0|Holy cow what a great f'n book! Is Ms. Chase really a dude?!  All of the words coming out of Drew's mouth I have heard from all my douchy guy friends. Definitely one of my all time favorite books :) Way to go!
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|Honestly, what can I say about Pink Floyd that most people don't already know!  Amazing band and amazing music! Love this movie!
B009UZBLSG|5.0|The Slimports works well with my Nexus 4, I bought it so I can go to friends homes and watch movies straight from my phone. As long as there is a HDMI cord available I am good to go. I love the fact I can have a movie or two on my phone and can watch easily anywhere on someone else's TV. It is a bit of a pain to wait for them to come into stock here on Amazon for $30, I waited 4 weeks. I see they are sold out again (5/24) I ordered on 5/21.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series was the first time I have ever read a series like this and I must say that I never put any of these books down for a period of time longer than getting some sleep!<br /><br />I love the raw sexuality in these books and I love the love story that is in these books.<br /><br />I will def read these books over and over again!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I'm rereading the four books and thoroughly enjoying them even tho I've listened to them and seen the movies numerous times.  There is something about reading that trumps listening to books and seeing movies.  The first time I read Breaking Dawn I had to reread the last 1/3 because I read it so fast to see what was going to happen that I had to go back to get the nuances of the story.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I liked the book... It had great erotic sex scenes in it.... I didn't find it over the top w/ the BDSM... I thought it would be... I do feel this is an excellent book for couples 2 read & perhaps share some of these experiences together.....
B006BAEQB2|3.0|My niece loved it.  I had trouble with the last half and in fact listened to the flat voice reading it in my Kindle so I could finish it.  I got bored with the machinations of the characters.  Helpless girls bore me.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|Lots of twists, most unexpected, pretty dark all the way through, but compelling in its own way. Worth the time to read it, I think.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I liked this.  Best so far is City of Glass, the third one.  I also liked City of Bones, the first one.  Now I can see the movie this summer.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read all three in the series.  The evolution of the Character Christian Grey is compelling!  It is well written, and the story line is like nothing else I've ever read.
B001NLL93W|5.0|. . .so far.  I liked all the characters and really enjoyed the books.  City of Bones is first one and also good.  City of Ashes second one and good.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this app and findnit very fun and relaxing! it is a very good family game and is enjoyable for all ages!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a wonderful and Challenging game.  There is just so much junk out there, that doesn't challenge ones mind.  I would venture to say it is the best of its kind that I have run across.  It really makes you think and use your imagination and intuition and to really pay attention to what you are seeing.  I try to only use the clues as a last resort.  It is very engrossing and Challenging.  I would really recommend this game to anyone.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is a great little game!! I have really enjoyed playing it!! Be very careful it's addictive!! And the best of all, it's free, and they don't keep hitting you up for money!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was great because I didn't see it coming. I try not to read about plotlines and am glad I didn't know about it. Would recommend!
B0091ICDHU|5.0|I loved this book, really loved it. I delayed buying it because it was $11, more than I like to pay for a Kindle book. After reading the reviews (again) I decided to buy it. I had never heard of Slam Poetry and it was really interesting, some of the poems so beautiful. I loved the characters especially Will and Lake of course. I loved Kel and Caulder too. I cried so many times in this book and no book has ever made me cry as much as this one. I'm glad I took the plunge and bought this book, it was worth every cent. I will read it again!
B007STXHTM|4.0|I bought this to use underwater (of course) and I wanted to attached the go pro to a anchor and see whats at the bottom of a lake we swim at. The lake is full of algi so we attached a scuba light too. We got some good footage and you can see it on youtube by looking at my channel JRESHOW. It also takes good video out of the water! The deepest i have gone with it is 35 feet but I plan to go deeper. This thing works like it should. No leaks.
B003JTHXN6|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time.  Really inspiring for thinking outside the box with customer service amongst other things.
B004WR125O|5.0|Out of the box, into the receiver.  Set it up. Worked!  Simple.  Using the app on my Iphone I can just listen to my tunes or I can stream from the internet.  Either way it is seamless, sounds great and simple!
B00000E7Q6|4.0|This is the first of the Bowie electronica period coming directly after The Tin Machine.  In this one he experiments heavily with Euro dance beats.  The new direction helped a good deal, the album is better than the Tin Machine albums and far better than any of his solo work since \\"Let's Dance.\\"<br /><br />The real surprise in the album is how joyful it is.  Bowie's albums usually have an element of darkness to them, this one does not.  It's upbeat throughout the album.  As such it seems to be missing something.  His next two electronica albums (\\"Outside\\" and \\"Earthling\\") are stronger efforts.
030726999X|4.0|I watched the first movie, girl with the dragon tattoo, and read the second book, the girl who played with fire, and then this one.  All three were very good and I'm glad to have enjoyed them.<br /><br />You don't need to read or watch the others to get this book.  It helps a bit, gives some background, but you really wouldn't be missing out and the author does a good job keeping all readers in the loop.<br /><br />You cannot read this book before reading the other two, if you want to read them all, you need to read them in order.<br /><br />On to the review of this book.<br /><br />This book picks up where the second book left off.  It isn't really a &#34;new&#34; story, as much as I felt book two was compared to book one, but it is a continuation of book two.  I enjoyed it throughly, however, the author has a tendency to over explain (think paragraphs to a couple pages) background detail about some things that just aren't really necessary.  I found myself skipping over these parts once I realized this.  That detracted from the book a bit, but not so much as I didn't think it was a good read, you just need to realize these parts are &#34;extra&#34; and &#34;optional&#34;.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I had never read anything by this author so opted to have a sample sent to my Kindle - WOW! I was totally drawn in by the author's extensive vocabulary and her intricate knowledge of of how language can be used.  Her plot line is well thought out and completely  believable.  She keeps you guessing until the very end and, even then, she does not try to artifically tie all the ends of her plot into a neat tidy bundle.  Her protagonist is not perfect and the author gives us a solid insight into how your past influences your present and future decisions. Very good book, I  can't wait to read another book of Ms. Setterfield.
B00A77II0U|3.0|After taking 20 mins to download after purchasing and having about 30 mins of playing the game froze solid. Wouldn't budge. I unloaded and Am now reloading. I paid  2.99 for  this app and for that  amount I  expect it to work. Giving it one more shot but if it doesn't work this time then I guess I'll have to come..back and change my  review. I  enjoyed what little I got to play so hopefully it works this time.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|who doesn't like the series! I just wish there were more special features past disk 3, but for the price i can't complain any.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Update: 10/16. Squeaky scroll wheel.<br />It's been almost 6 months since I bought this mouse and everything is great with one small exception, the scroll wheel on the mouse squeaks in a way that makes me shiver. Like nails on a chalkboard. Downgrading my review to 4 stars. Still a great mouse. The sensor works fine, the buttons are still clicky as ever, the rubber coating is still in tact. I've bought two of these mice and so far it's only happened with one (I haven't had the second mouse as long as the squeaky one, and the squeaky one gets used far more than the other). I'll write another update if it happens to my other version of this mouse.<br /><br />The squeaky sound feels like metal against metal and happens when I scroll up but not when I scroll down. It's a tiny flaw and I've had other mice squeak on me but this particular sound makes me cringe. And unfortunately, I have had to stop using this otherwise excellent mouse. I still give it four stars because I think the \\"flaw\\" is more of a personal preference and the mouse isn't technically broken.<br /><br />I have previously owned the Logitech G9x, Logitech G500, Razer Copperhead, Razer Death Adder, Razer Imperator, Evoluent Vertical Mouse, and most recently the Mionix NAOS 8200. I am in front of a computer every day so I don't mind paying a premium for good peripherals and I am constantly looking for new choices. I actually ended up buying 2 of these - one for work and one for home because I loved it so much. Here's why:<br /><br />I judge a mouse using the following criteria, in order of importance:<br /><br />1. Hand Position & Button Layout - If I have to worry about cramping after hours of use, it's a deal breaker for me. If the buttons are not where I naturally would expect to find them, it's a deal breaker for me.<br />2. Strain Factor - the amount of energy it takes to move the mouse around for hours and hours, including the energy it takes to lift the mouse up re-position it on my mouse pad.<br />3.Button Action & Responsiveness - the way the buttons feel when you click on them. If the click is too mushy or soft or if the travel distance of the button is too shallow or too deep, it just throws the whole thing off for me. Is there any lag in the mouse?<br />4. Build Quality - Does it feel cheap? Is the plastic thin and hollow?<br />5. Wear & Tear Resistance - How does the mouse feel after 1000 clicks? Does the paint fade? Do the buttons wear out?<br />6. Customization - Can I remap the buttons? Is it easy to change sensitivity? How many buttons does the mouse have?<br />7. Bonus Features - does it have anything that makes it stand out over others?<br /><br />This is how I would rank the Anker Mouse:<br /><br />1. Hand Position -<br />This is one of the things that I immediately noticed about this mouse. There is something in the sizing and the angle of slant of the left / right click buttons that just feels right in my hand. This is a very personal preference and will be different for all people. But for me, there is just something \\"right\\" about it. In terms of finger positioning, it feels kind of like gripping a baseball. Your index and middle finger create a comfortable fork, while your thumb, ring, and pinky easily and naturally wrap around the sides of the mouse.<br /><br />As for the button layout, there are more buttons than I actually use and some of them are definitely placed in such a way that you have to move your hand into unnatural contortions to reach them. For example, the mouse has 2 buttons just below the mouse wheel. I found trying to click on these buttons to be very unnatural. The good news though is that all the standard buttons - left click, right click, mouse wheel, and 2 thumb buttons are perfectly positioned. Yes, the mouse actually has 3 thumb buttons, but for me, only two of them (the middle and back thumb buttons) are optimally positioned while the third (front thumb button) requires a bit of a reach.<br /><br />I still would score the button layout to be very high because as I said, I don't use any of the other buttons. All I really need are the left/right click, mouse wheel, and 2 thumb buttons (which I remap as forward / backward buttons). The other good thing about this mouse is that the buttons I don't use never get in the way and I don't ever accidentally click on them.<br /><br />2. Strain Factor -<br />The strain factor of the mouse is not related to a mouse's weight. The key factor here is actually the grip required for you to lift the mouse when you reposition it. If the mouse requires you to drastically change your hand position before you can pick it up, or if the hand position you use to pick up the mouse causes unnecessary tension on your wrist or forearm, then the mouse has a high strain factor. For example, picking up a bowling ball without using the finger holes requires a lot more strain than picking it up using the holes, even though the weight of the ball hasn't changed. This is because when you are not using the finger holes, you have to apply more force to grip the ball and balance the weight. This is precisely the reason why I moved away from mice like the Evoluent Vertical Mouse and the Mionix 8200.<br /><br />But the Anker mouse really shines here. Like I mentioned above, the default hand position of the mouse works in such a way that your thumb, ring, and pinky fingers comfortably hug the sides of the mouse. Any time you need to lift the mouse to reposition it, you just apply a small amount of pressure with those fingers. Because the mouse is not too wide or too small, it is a very natural motion and registers very very low on the Strain Factor. There is also a big grippy strip of rubber on the side of the mouse where your thumb sits. And it definitely aids in the handling of the mouse.<br /><br />3. Button Action & Responsiveness -<br />Each of the buttons have a different feel, and even makes a discernably different clicking sound. For example, the left click buttonhas a sharper click while the right click has a softer, slightly dulled click sound. This is great because over time you come to develop an intuitive sense for the acoustic response of the mouse. The left click also has a slightly shorter travel distance than the right click (or at least that's how it feels) and that is good. This makes for a very responsive trigger, without being overly sensitive. The side, middle thumb button also has a raised texture to it that feels nice and is useful for finding the other thumb buttons without looking down. The thumb buttons have a deeper travel distance than the left click as well, and that's how it should be so that you don't have to worry about accidental clicks while handling the mouse.<br /><br />The mouse is highly responsive. I use a steel series metal mouse pad and the mouse is very accurate and precise. The feet of the mouse glides very smoothly over the surface and I can easily go from broad quick movements to small, precise movements. This thing just flies.<br /><br />4. Build Quality -<br />I initially thought this would be the place where the mouse suffers the most, especially for the price. But I can't find fault with it. If anything, there are some places where the light leaks through the seams of the mouse and some of the seams are slightly larger than the seams you would find on the more expensive mice. But it doesn't make the mouse feel cheap in any way. The mouse has a non-slip coating which feels very good. And there is a good chunk of textured rubber where your thumb rests, which is one of my favorite things about the mouse. In fact, this is one of the little things that adds significantly to the feel of quality to the mouse. The rubber thumb strip feels so reassuring when you are handling the mouse that I immediately notice it is gone when I handle other mice.<br /><br />5. Wear & Tear Resistance -<br />This remains to be seen. I bought my first Anker mouse on April 22, almost exactly a month ago. And themore I used it the more I liked it (which is why I bought another one). So far I haven't felt any effects of wear and tear. But it's also too early to tell. I have some concerns about the fact that the left / right click buttons are made from a separate piece of plastic from the palm rest of the mouse. A lot of other companies like Razer and Logitech mold the left, right, and palm rest from a single piece of plastic. This is to make sure that none of the buttons can wiggle out of place or shift over time. The Anker mouse does not seem to have this feature and I am curious as to how it will perform. The other question is how long the non-slip coating on the buttons will last. Every mouse I have ever had has lost its coating over time, but the good ones take a year or more to rub off.<br /><br />I will update this review if I find anything of note.<br /><br />6. Customization -<br />I highly recommend installing the drivers from the Anker website. It gives you the ability to remap the buttons and even change the color of the led light for the logo. It isn't too difficult to remap a mouse's buttons these days using third party software, but when a company goes to the trouble of making its own, then its a sign that they are committed to the product. I never use features like changing profiles on the fly so I won't talk much about that. But I was able to easily change the button mappings and sensitivity, as well as saving the profile to my computer. Very straight forward and easy to use.<br /><br />7. Bonus Features -<br />The braided chord is a nice touch and so is the customizable led light for the logo. But the real surprise is the ability to customize the weight of the mouse. Typically this kind of a feature set is only found on more expensive mice but Anker has included it at a much lower cost. I'm still playing around with the weights - one mouse is configured on the heavier side and the other mouse is configured on the lighter side and I'm trying to see which I prefer.<br /><br />Overall, the mouse feels very well thought out. The Anker team didn't try to cram in a lot of features for the sake of it. And they didn't compromise on quality to hit a low price. There is a strong sense of a carefully designed product here and I feel like I will be sticking with this mouse for a long time.

B002GHHHP6|5.0|This is  a super film.  James Garner helps put it all together.<br />He IS Maverick & he always will be.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this as a book club selection.  We usually picked a random book from a hat, but this meeting a lot of the members raved about the Fifty Shades and how we must read it.  I felt we may be 'jumping the shark' as they say in TV Land, and boy were we ever.<br /><br />This wasn't for me.  I read it as quickly as possible to get through it.  It made me angry, not hot in the pants.  I spent way too much timing yelling at the main character, 'Stop murmuring!  Why are you murmuring so much!'<br /><br />Now I will give it to the book/writer, 90% of the book club members loved it and continued with the series.  It does seem to have quite the following.<br /><br />You may want to spend your time reading:  [[ASIN:B00AVQ3HBW Letters To Young Chong]] or [[ASIN:B00ASACHNU The Bad Girls' Club]] if you want a book that covers sex but with a strong feminine roll.
6305128952|5.0|This movie proves that you don't have to &#34;disrobe&#34; to make a scene sensual or sexy.<br />There's a scene at a dance...in a BARN...with tons of people all around & Robert Redford<br />& Kristin Scott Thomas are &#34;all alone WITH their clothes on!.&#34;  That's good acting!
B0072OFOM6|3.0|Felt like the cast in general wasnt in as good shape as season 1 and the prequal season.<br />The new Sparticus isn't as convincing and as badass. He seamed a bit soft. Still watched the show and look forward to the final season.
030758836X|4.0|This book pretty much blew my mind. I read it in actual hard cover. It was interesting in that I really did not like the characters, yet I found the story wildly entertaining. It was like watching an accident and you just can't look away from the gore because you want to know what happened.<br />It is not gory or sexual, but a total mind warp. It is hard to even describe the book, especially without giving away the twists. But if you might like a psychological thriller, this would be a very interesting read.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|He is a HUGE RUSH fan.  We both enjoyed watching it!  Would recommend this to any Rush fan to add to your collection.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Saw the movie, had to own it! Great DVD!  Beautiful/haunting scenery, great story and acting.  It is a war-themed movie so obviously not suitable for younger children.

B007KQ6XYY|2.0|Sure, it's a fun game. And In App Purchasing- especially when it isn't even for game content (rather, for other games)- is obnoxious. Imagine my surprise, then, when I clicked on that full screen ad to see what would happen when my child did so, and while the Amazon App Store wasn't an option, Chrome was... and I was already logged in.  I'm sure this is my fault for having been on Amazon and not closing the browser... but beware, parents: turning IAP off may not protect you from unexpected charges.  I for one will no longer purchase something my kids might use if it has IAP. I personally think IAP should be listed in the permissions for the app!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 has better graphics and sound quality than the first Temple Run. I also believe that the app is even more addictive, especially with its new features. I recommend this game to players with workable fingers and to players who enjoyed the first Temple Run.

B00BU2SIW4|3.0|After a few times through, I think I'm starting to get this disc a bit more. I probably would have enjoyed it from listen numero uno, except for some preconceived expectations (after noting \\"Depeche Mode\\" on the cover) of this album.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers here, that to me it's a good work from them, just not great. I don't know how many stars that should really equate to though? 3.47, so I rounded down. Give me another week or so and I might be over the 3.5 mark and up to 4 stars.<br /><br />Appears like there was a lot of focus on the individual instrument sounds, which are nice, but I didn't feel the writing included the typical strong melodies or much pop appeal that's present on earlier albums. Though it seemed a bit out of place at first, this album trades in some of what I'm missing above, for a bluesy rock feeling, that I'd swear John Lee Hooker helped out with from the beyond. And after just a bit, those tracks originating from south of the Mason Dixon Line are now among my favorites on this disc. A side note for fans of Depeche Mode's sound, I can also recommend checking out the new \\"Splintered in Her Head\\" disc [[ASIN:B00BR0KNK4 Onnanoko]]. It's probably a bit more along the lines of where I was hoping Depeche Mode might go with this one, and the reason it's taken me some time to really appreciate it.

B002ZG980U|5.0|The plot of this movie is extremely complex and engaging, which makes watching the film several times well worth the effort. I am an English teacher, and I know a psychology teacher at my school who uses this film in her class as a teaching tool to accompany and support a related unit in her course. There is a balance between fast-paced action scenes and enough psychological intrigue to keep viewers interested to the very end ... even if the plot is somewhat confusing at times. The film makes viewers re-evaluate the true nature of reality and consciousness, while at the same time the film is entertaining with great special-effects eye candy.
B006PTL1QM|5.0|this movie is good for psychology students and movie-lovers alike.  Ms. Knightly gives an excellent performance.  Jung & Freud are shown in all their humanity.
B005LAII3A|4.0|I first saw this movie in the theater when it came out, and I decided that I wanted to own a copy, because of the special effects and because I am a fan of sci-fi films that are well-crafted and entertaining. It amazing how far computer generated graphics have improved compared the first version of this film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. Visually, this film is stunning, but the emotional / psychological intrigues are weaker. I felt less engaged by the characters and did not feel much for them in their journey, however, there was enough in the special effects and action of the plot to make me want to see it more than once.

B00BUADSMQ|2.0|I think you can rate the Die Hard movies based on their villains. Alan Rickman set the bar high as Hans Gruber (Die Hard) and Jeremy Irons as his vengeful brother Simon Paul Gruber (Die Hard With A Vengeance) matched Rickman's original achievement in the charming English Actors With Weird Accent Villain Stakes. And those are the two best movies in this franchise by far.<br /><br />Timothy Olyphant wasn't bad, but was far from great - they should have cast Boyd Crowder - and William Sadler in Die Hard 2 - Die Harder was the worst of the bunch. Until now. The bad guys in A Good Day To Die Hard are characterless cyphers. Two Bad Oligarchs, basically interchangeable. A deadly henchman. A treacherous daughter. And I can't remember what any of them look like or anything they had to say.<br /><br />Lazy and tired, A Good Day to Die Hard is no more than a long string of seen-it-before action sequences and a \\"plot\\" full of holes and loose threads. As with Indiana Jones, the only interesting thing in A Good Day to Die Hard is the vaguest possibility that in giving Bruce Willis a son who also knows how to kick ass and take names the franchise may be thinking ahead. I wouldn't bet on it though.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Let me start off by saying my husband was at Wally World one night and decided to pick up a book for me. So obviously , because we want to see the movie, he got me this book. When I first starting reading this I thought this is going to be something I can never get through. I don't read adults books for one, but I also just thought I was going to absolutely hate it!<br /><br />Let me tell you why...<br /><br />This book is written like a documentary. It is not the story of one character. It is a little story of many, many people throughout the \\"Zombie War.\\" It is written with each story being an interview. I am not into these this type of things, and I thought it was going to be dry, but I thought how it was written is one of the things that made it work. Once I started, I couldn't stop.<br /><br />This book is beyond compelling and interesting. It captivates you. I loved reading the different stories from the various places in the USA and around the world. To me, I could see I different personality with each, but they also had similarities. I think it is important to remember that the stories are told from a point of looking back as to what has happened. They all experienced the same thing to some extinct, all of these people are connected. They survived the outbreak of zombies and the near destruction of mankind.<br /><br />I can not tell you how much I loved this. It made me think, and I felt like I was watching this film of the past. something that happened in our history. Almost like watching a documentary of any past war.<br /><br />I would recommend this to any zombie lover. It is an original, fresh (to me) take on the whole zombie/ end of world type story. Like I said, I went into this expecting to hate it, but I loved it. It is easily one of my favorite books I have read. I never found a moment dull and I would read it again just to pick up on some of things I might have missed!<br /><br />On a side note... I am not sure how this movie is going to work. I think it will just have to incorporate the events and how things unfolded in the book. Like I stated before, there is no main character. Just a bunch of stories of people connected. I am still excited to see the movie, and what they do with turning this book into a motion picture!hink it will just have to incorporate the events and how things unfolded in the book.

B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|Despite its title, The Last Stand is not Arnold's True Grit. He will probably keep going forever. However it's a fun and satisfying popcorn movie in which all the obvious things happen and we enjoy them anyway. Why? Because action, emotion, and humor are all well-balanced, the cast play nicely together, and Arnold is likeably self-deprecating about his age and the effects of time. Highly recommended for one of those nights when you don't want to think.

It works so-so on my more heavy duty camping knives. Since I am no expert at knife sharpening, this seemed like a practical little tool to have around. I am still looking into other sharpeners and gain skills in keeping my ka-bar and mora knives razor sharp. Any suggestions?
630471193X|5.0|I love this film because John Travolta is a simple man who experiences a phenomenon that makes his mind function in a extra-ordinary way, but he remains true to his simple self, friends, and small town. I had not seen the film in years, and loved sharing it with my kids. Also, it is refreshingly clean (no crass jokes, nudity, drugs, etc.)

B00BTJMS1A|5.0|(revised review) This is a very, very fun game that will remind a lot of people of Dr. Mario or Tetris.  It's much more reminiscent of a game you can find videos of if you search for \\"Dossun! Ganseki Battle\\".  If you like those games (or Bejeweled) and would like an additional dimension for a development added (where the matches are more strategic and there is an element of development and growth) - you will like this game a lot.<br /><br />(original review - I didn't know how to play) I've played to the point where my high score is in the millions, but now the experience points (purple) have stopped increasing. Could be a 5 star game, but this is basically stopping my progress...

B008BU75IQ|5.0|Jeffrey Archer does epic family/history stories like no one else. Once again, in this third of how many books in the Barrington/Clifton series is remarkable and engaging. I find Archer is still as good at combining historic fact with characterized fiction as he was when he wrote Cain and Abel so many years ago. If it's a formula, then good for him because each book carries me away back in time for the hours it takes to finish the book. The characters change over the series but a little slower than, say Ken Folletts or James Michener's. We spend time with each Barrington and Clifton and it's only now that we see the future will likely revolve more around the next generation than the one that has held us for two previous books.
B002KSPKRS|2.0|When I have received this product it work for 10 minutes and the speakers blew it was a waste for my time money
B009NG1Q96|4.0|Definitely moves the story forward. I felt frustrated and angry with certain characters at times but resolution is reached and they fairly stay true to the mind-junk that teenagers tend to embroil themselves. Good integrity over all.
B00C061I3K|2.0|Look, unlike some of the critics here,  I like the classic 70s Disco period. I love Pharrell Williams'([[ASIN:B001RTYKCC Best of N.E.R.D]]) work. I also liked Britain's \\"Nu-Disco\\" movement and I'm a huge fan of groups like Jamiroquai ([[ASIN:B000INAXGU High Times: Singles 1992-2006]]) and Junior Senior. ([[ASIN:B000SQKYS4 Hey Hey My My Yo Yo]])<br /><br />Having said that, this is a disappointment. Daft Punk may have used a lot of samples, but nevertheless, they, along with the Chemical Brothers, LCD Soundsystem and Crystal Method brought a new heavy-metal-stadium filler sensibility that no one ever thought EDM/techno/house could ever do. It's because of them that DeadMau5, SHM, the Ed Banger crew, Skrillex, etc. are enjoying their limos-n'-champagne lifestyle these days.<br /><br />On Homework, Discovery and Human, it never felt like like they were trying to actually sell records. Ever. Just like Metallica's first records were seemingly apathetic, if not downright hostile to the notion of \\"hits.\\" Even the Tron Soundtrack -- which I didn't like -- I could still see they were being true to themselves.<br />But all that's over now. For the first time, the mall rats know Daft Punk thanks to \\"Get Lucky\\" which seems to be the end of an outright goal of getting a hit record that would get played on American radio. Argh!<br /><br />There is one moment that knocked me for a loop -- in a good way. The last track \\"Contact\\" samples the underrated new-wave rockers, the Sherbs, ([[ASIN:B00004NRZE Defying Gravity]]) and their minor early 80s hit \\"We Ride Tonight.\\" which is one of my favorite singles of all time!<br /><br />Other than that though, most of RAM is not even halfway good Disco. It's warmed over 70s AM Pop minus the cheesiness or the charm of a singer like Carly Simon or Karen Carpenter. Jamiroquai's best records embrace disco's silliness while still managing righteous grooves.<br /><br />I hate to say this, but this is a Hack Record. Daft need new programming.

B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Love this game. Yes it does take time to get started and good, but it's still great. Get it, you won't regret it.
B00C061I3K|2.0|I really like Daft Punk.  I won't pretend to be a hardcore fan of theirs, I regularly listen to about 5-7 songs by them but those songs are intense and a blast to listen to.  The same could not be said for \\"Random Access Memories\\", which I listened to in its entirety.  Other than 2 great songs, this album is almost completely inaccessible to me.  \\"Get Lucky\\" obviously steals the show; the song is fast paced and just plain fun to listen to.  \\"Instant Crush\\" utilized The Strokes' Julian Casablancas for vocals, but after what they've done to his voice one could hardly tell who the hell sings during the song and I'd imagine it would make little difference if Casablancas sang it as opposed to somebody else.  Nevertheless, the song is till fun to listen to and it is at least relatively fast paced.  I really enjoyed these 2 songs and see myself listening to them regularly in my future.  \\"Doin' it Right\\" is pretty cool but isn't particularly innovative or special.  Still, the song in passable and worth listening to.  Of course, that is subjective to your opinion as well.  \\"Contact\\" sounds like utter garbage and I feel like this song could have been made 15 years ago and even then it probably would have sounded cooler.  It sounds like a hockey victory song or something.  The song about Georgio is really interesting the first time around, and that's about the extent of the song's lasting appeal...  It is too long and there is way too much dialogue.  Not really a good song to put on when you just want to hit play and jam.  If this came up on my shuffle, I'd instantly skip it.  That is to say, if I had it on my phone.<br /><br />Come to think of it, very few songs on this album are songs I could listen to while running, driving, or even just sitting in class.  \\"Motherboard\\" was literally on the brink of putting me to sleep.<br /><br />My personal advice...  Do NOT buy this album just because Daft Punk made it.  They are extremely talented individuals who are capable of phenomenal things, and this is a very poor representation of that.  Just buy Get Lucky and Instant Crush.  Maybe give Doin it Right a chance.  Just save the rest of the money on a subway sandwich or pizza.  Something other than the rest of this album.<br /><br />If anything can be said for RAM, people looking for songs so boring they'll be put to sleep will get exactly that.
1742200508|5.0|My family and I are long-time travelers around the globe, and have developed definite opinions of travel guides over the years.  Along with planning travel over the internet, we've basically settled on two different guides to take with us as we go.  The Eyewitness Travel Guides are my preference for advanced planning and reading on a particular destination.  The Lonely Planet Guides are perfect for our travels while we are on the road.  Lonely Planet fills in many of the details that Eyewitness leaves off the pages of their travel guides.  Eyewitness gives us the visual for where we are heading, Lonely Planet gives us the filler.  Between the two, we've settled on a routine that has suited us well for our travel purposes.  Highly recommended!

B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Let me start off this review by saying, I generally like to keep this things as unbiased as possible. I say this, because I am not going to be able to manage that with this game. I love it. I was immediately hooked in from the very first simple introduction cut scene and basic concept of gameplay, until the very last upgrade and battle. From the charming 8-bit art to the nostalgic music and sound effects, this game is going to get it's hooks into ANY old school gamer like myself.<br /><br />I was extremely skeptical of the idea of a tile matching puzzle RPG on paper I assure you. Just writing that sentence to me seems like those are things that just should not mesh well. Somehow though, they pulled it off with aplomb. The core gameplay outside of the hub area (a prison cell of some sorts) is a cleverly timed puzzle game. On the top of your tile area you have your 8-bit character battling through hordes of monsters, opening chests and doors, and various other things. If he messes up or takes to long to attack, he is sent further to the left of the screen, while successes send him further to the right. Because the pace increases the longer you stay in the level, it becomes harder and harder to dispatch obstacles in order to stay alive and keep moving forward for the bonuses.<br /><br />While you are on your run however, you will match stone and wood tiles, as well as collect gold and experience from battles with monsters and specific quests to accomplish during the run. With these, you repair your little prison hub, so you can improve your character. This is where the game goes from fun little time passer, to something I actively played while at home. Renovating and upgrading your character improvement rooms so you can invest your gold in upgrades for your character is extremely addictive. You can improve your characters defense to lessen the effective monster's blows have on you, or upgrade your damage output for physical or magical attacks and items. One of my absolute favorite things about this aspect of the game, is that it is not pay to play! There are no short cuts, and so no unfair advantages at all. It's just old school fun.<br /><br />I got this game during a free app spotlight sale, but if I had to buy it just to keep playing it, I would do it in a heartbeat. It's just that good! Give it a try if you're a fan of old school games and it will wow you just as much as it does me.ute favorite things about this aspect of the game, is that it is not pay to play!

B009AMANBA|3.0|This film is well-made; however, the plot is all about politics and voting.  The movie was not what my husband and I expected,<br />but we are glad we watched it.  It is not what I call a keeper, but Daniel Day-Lewis is superb.  Would I have ordered the movie<br />if I had known a little about it?...No!

B00CPTUNBK|3.0|I have to say upfront that although I'm a massive fan of just about every Zombie genre out there, I've never really seen the appeal of the animated ones.  I mean, anime is one thing, but everything else just seems a bit too \\"Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island\\"-esque to me.  So if you go in for cartoons trying to figure out how to hold on to humanity, add a star to my review.<br /><br />That said, MLP:F holds its own in a genre plagued by bad attempts to bring something fresh to the same tired old storylines and resurrected plot elements (pardon the puns).  The acting (I guess you'd call it voice acting?) was good enough - it didn't sound like a bunch of morons moaning into a microphone while someone showed a cartoon with the noise turned down.  Cathy Weseluck of course stole the show in the scene where Spike beheads zombie Rarity, only to have Babs and Tiara show up with the antidote too late.  The animation came so close to anime, I kept wondering why the characters weren't wearing sailor moon outfits, until I reminded myself it's Hasbro, not DeviantArt.  Plot was the usual \\"apocalypse breaks out during the 1st princess games, survivors picked off one by one as they walk the train tracks out of Canterlot, trying to get home\\".  The Zecora/everfree forest part should have been it's own movie, or just dumped for time and cohesiveness.  But at least now we'll understand why AliTwi got herself banished to the EquestriaGirls world with her memories intact.<br /><br />Oh, and of course, the climactic ZombieShy/FlutterDead clone battle in Apploosa made me like and hate the outcome at the same time.  On one hand, I'll never think of that shade of yellow without hurling.  On the other hand, no matter how good the animation, you can't get me to belive a pony can do those things with a sword - I don't care how many amulets you're wearing.<br /><br />I thought the setting would have made faster zombies preferable, although the slow Zombie Dash scenes were particularly tender.<br /><br/>I suppose the fanbase needs the following: Derpy is best still-alive pony, Cheerilee is best zombie pony.  Zombie Nightmare Moon was redundant and stupid.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|On a dark night filled with even darker magics, an insane cult attempts to give Nightmare Moon a body and life of her own, utterly separate from Princess Luna. But, when the spell is interrupted by Celestia, something unexpected is created.<br /><br />Now, an little black alicorn filly named Nyx finds herself living under the care of Twilight Sparkle, only to be haunted by memories and emotions from her past. Is she Nightmare Moon reborn or is she simply a doppelganger with a soul and mind of her own? Can Twilight Sparkle protect Nyx from those refuse to see past her dragon eyes and black coat?<br /><br />Or, will Nyx be forced to inherit the sins that may not even be hers and become the greatest evil Equestria has ever known?<br /><br />Tara Strong's performance as Twilight Sparkle is definatly Oscar worthy, and I'm glad to see that Pen Stroke's \\"Past Sins\\" has been made canon. The movie is darker then you'd see in the show, but that's a good thing in this case, although it's not enough to get the R rating it has, but that's probably because there's a bit of blood shown. The 3-D was probably the best I've ever seen, especially for an animated film.<br /><br />Overall, you gotta see this. Oh, and stick around after the credits.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I have finally actually read this book and I love it!!!!! 5 stars! Very different from shorter versions you have probably read or heard. Charming!
B00BS3EMNY|5.0|The criticisms of this album that I've read both here and on Amazon's UK site seem to be centered on one fact: the production values. Specifically, that they've increased. As if sharp production is a negative in and of itself.<br /><br />This album is more polished that Scenes from the Cutting Room Floor, but after listening to it several times I keep coming to the same conclusion... this is a more complete album, if you listen from end-to-end. This album is neither \\"safe\\" nor a regression of form. If anything, it has the sophistication of \\"Lipstick on His Collar\\" and \\"I Know that He's Mine\\" from the first album and spreads it across an hour-long feast for the ears.<br /><br />Side Note: As I write this, The Shocking Miss Emerald is only available as an expensive import. I actually saved $10 by ordering directly from the UK site. (Hence why this review is not marked as a \\"certified\\" Amazon purchase...)
B00CS65JS2|5.0|This album has a wide variety of influences and again, Daft Punk does not disappoint! I highly recommend buying this album.
B008ZVNC2O|4.0|It's clear that Mick Hucknall's voice is just a shadow of its former self. He can't inject his voice in the signature style that made (and kept) him an international pop star for more than two decades.<br /><br />That being said, this is a man who could sing a math text to you and make you feel it in your heart.<br /><br />I suspect we won't hear much more from Mick Hucknall, but this is still a worthy effort and a worthwhile listen.

0670014893|5.0|of all spy novelists. Lecarre is one of the two best writers alive (the other being Paul Theroux). His dialogue is just the best. He unfolds a plot at his own, brilliant, pace. He brings the reader far into his written world and you hate to leave. I read ADT in one day, two sittings. It's that good. Believe me, I am not a fan of the man's politics. But his genius far outweighs the irritation of his prejudices. As for this plot--if it seems surreal, you're woefully unaware of the state of politics, war, and the business of intelligence. And I might say I envy you. This is a timely and scary book. And it is a fine addition to my library of everything LeCarre ever wrote. (As for Theroux--he just writes so naturally you become him, you live in him and experience what he experiences, fiction or non-fiction).

B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|I admit I was skeptical when I first heard about this diet plan, but decided to give it a try.  Though the research is sketchy, it makes sense to me.  Restricting calories two days a week seems like a good way to 'rest' our busy busy stomachs and intestines, and give some down time for these very important innards.  I've been on it for about a month and found that the fasting days, though not always easy, are not as hard as I thought: some days I almost enjoy it, while on others the gnawing starts at around 4pm and doesn't really let up until dinner. Weight loss?  I am also on Weight Watchers so it's hard to say exactly how much is due to that diet but I will say that, as of now, it is not spectacular but steady.  And despite the books' claim that you don't feel hungrier on the non-fasting days, I've not found this to be exactly true. It's easy to say, 'well, I fasted yesterday, so today I can feast'! Even so,I plan to stay on the 5-2 diet for six months, and hopefully it will help me achieve and maintain my weight loss goals.

0307341577|1.0|A repulsive, juvenile book, and yes I did read every page. I loved \\"Gone Girl\\" and Gillian Flynn can certainly write, but I won't be reading anything else by her after spending money on this piece of trash. I had to take a shower after finishing the book, it was that gross.
0553386794|4.0|I bought \\"A Game of Thrones\\" at my local bookstore as a Christmas gift to myself. My boyfriend had been raving about the novel series for as long as I could remember, but he read the novels in Spanish, and I wanted the real thing.<br /><br />The plot didn't let me down. The compelling characters and powerful storytelling drew me right in.<br /><br />...Then the typos pulled me out. Seriously, I'm talking about page after page of typos. Is this just my edition? I hope so!<br /><br />Here's the worst example (the one that keeps me up at night): \\"The raven was pecking at an egg, breaking the shell. Pushing his beak through the hole, he pulled out morsels of white and yoke.\\"<br /><br />YOKE is NOT the same as YOLK. How could this get past the editors???<br /><br />Other examples include:<br /><br />\\"But I love him,\\" Sansa wailed, confused and fright-ened.<br /><br />\\"They sooner, the better,\\" Theon Greyjoy agreed.<br /><br />\\"Ser Edmure has sent men to every village and holdfast withing a day's ride of the border,\\" Ser Kary! explained.<br /><br />Yes...in that last one, the knight's name actually contains an exclamation mark instead of the letter \\"L\\"...<br /><br />Typos aside, I really enjoyed the story and am about to start \\"A Dance With Dragons\\".
B00AKFG15S|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, a great read. Although the 3rd book, the author gave readers who may not have read the earlier two books just enough information, but not so much that readers who have in fact read the other two books were plagued by constant recaps. I now need ti know how the story continues
034554398X|5.0|Hands down, \\"A Storm of Swords\\" is my favorite in the \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series. After a rocky relationship with \\"A Clash of Kings,\\" I wasn't too sure about pressing on with the novels. I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />\\"A Storm of Swords\\" started off very slow, so I was worried I had made the wrong decision by giving the series another chance. However, the second half of the novel really paid off.<br /><br />I was delighted, intrigued, FURIOUS! There was a point near the end in whish I was so shocked and in denial at what had happened that I just wanted to chuck the book across the room--but couldn't because I had to keep reading to see if what had happened was really TRUE!<br /><br />Sadly...it was. I'm glad I could experience the shock firsthand, and not have anyone spoil it for me.
1476734941|5.0|I actually watched the BBC documentary first and then bought the book for recipe ideas.  The information Michael Mosley provided from interviews with doctors and scientists made total sense to me so I wanted to try it and convinced my husband to do it with me.  That was two months ago and he's lost 20 pounds whereas I've lost 10.  We fast on Tuesday and Thursdays and it has actually made us more conscious of what we are eating all together and has somehow affected my appetite for the better; it also saves us money on groceries for those two days. This may not work for everyone but I see there are tons of really good reviews here and I'm also confirming that it is really worth trying.
0345535421|3.0|I loved \\"A Game of Thrones\\" so the moment I finished it I ran out and bought \\"A Clash of Kings.\\" It was a bit of a letdown.<br /><br />As I wandered through the novel's 800 or so pages, I found my focus drifting. Too much repetition, too many words for too little action. Honestly, I think you could boil this book down to about half the word count, and it would be for the better.<br /><br />Then I came up with the perfect reading technique: just skip the chapters I'm not interested in! That is how I got through \\"A Clash of Kings\\": by jumping from character to character, following their story, and then going back for the characters I cared less about.
055358202X|1.0|After the whirlwind ending in \\"A Storm of Swords,\\" this novel didn't measure up.<br /><br />I was annoyed by the fact that the entire novel was focused only on a small group of characters, mainly the ones living in King's Landing. Just like that, most of my favorite characters vanished from this clunky, thousand-page-long detour.<br /><br />That's what it felt like: a detour. Just more words on the page. More detailed descriptions of clothing, food and house names. Very little substance, in my opinion. The final chapters are the only interesting ones (because something actually/finally happens), but by then \\"A Feast for Crows\\" had lost all its appeal.<br /><br />Overall, I felt a bit cheated. Did the author really need to sever the story into two endless novels that take place at the same time (\\"A Feast for Crows\\" and \\"A Dance with Dragons\\"? Or is this some marketing scheme to sell more books? I can't help but wonder...
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|This books defining concept, that of cloning technology reminds me very much of the MMORPG Eve-Online.  It is an interesting concept wherein our bodies are now viewed as mere &#34;sleeves&#34;, something you can slip into or out of with no issues.  Intersteller travel is accomplished by means of a data streem transmitted through sub-space.  You can conceivably be on Mars and need to attend a meeting in St. Louis, so you travel to your nearest cloning center, lay down and have you persona transmitted and wake up in a clone in St. Louis.  For all intents and purposes this renders you immortal, as most diseases and injuries are rendered null and void by the ability to just slip on a new sleeve.  I very much enjoyed the storyline and concept.  There is only one slight issue which I know not everyone will agree with, that of a soul.  If we are as the book represents us, only a collection of electronic data that can be overlayed on any hunk of bio-mass (a body or new sleeve) what happens to your soul when that very first body dies? It does illustrate in the book what happens over hundreds of years of living, as slowly morals and ethics all cease to be of importance, that is indeed a sad future to contemplate.
B0098460O4|5.0|Perfect. Beautiful. I hope that these two keep recording. Their voices are terrific together. Love the choice of songs. Can't  get enough of it.
B001TH16DI|5.0|This is a wonderful Blue Ray set for any treckie fan out there. It was worth the wait to get all six movies at a good price,I would recommend this.

B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I wish they could go back in time and fix Men in Black 2.<br /><br />New favorite alien, Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg).  New favorite leader of MIB, Agent O (Emma Thompson).  New favorite villain, Boris..............\\"It's just Boris\\" the animal (Jemaine Clement).  Most astounding performance by an actor, Josh Brolin as Tommy Lee Jones circa 1969.  \\"You know what would be good with this?  Silence.\\"<br />This is an amazing comeback, resurrecting the original feel of the franchise (after that unfortunate mistake that's wedged between the two classics).  They've certainly redeemed themselves with this entry.  This movie is packed with laughs and excitement, and, I'm not ashamed to admit, a scene on a beach that had me bawling.  From now on, when I watch this series, I'm skipping 2 and going straight to 3 after 1.  (It's called 'second' rate for a reason.)
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|LOVED THIS MOVIE!  Clearly, I'm an Arnold fan.  If you are too then this is for you!  Also Johnny Knoxville is Johnny Knoxville - insanity and hilarious!  That guy who showed everybody his balls from the movie Waiting  is in it too, just the sound of his voice always makes me laugh.  I felt like the main characters were cast well and really portrayed a true \\"family\\" feel as they fought this intense battle together.  The town itself is a hoot if you appreciate or know any country folks.  The action scenes are very well done, graphics look nice.  I felt just the right mix of emotions (there is one very sad part) but Arnold is the protagonist...so you can fill in the rest :)
B005LAIIPS|3.0|I found it amusing that so many of the characters involved in this movie kept asking what's happening, why is this happening, what's going on?  I gave up wondering \\"why\\" after the first installment in this conspiracy series.  There is no purpose other than to keep repeating the same story, filled with the same types of characters doing exactly the same things for the same reasons.  It's amazing how many times they fill the same control room with the same people hunting down the same guy, having the same fearless leader order their death and no one bats an eye.  Considering their proclivity for murdering their own people, what's their job security like?  And what idiot would work for someone who's willing to kill their own!?  This goes way beyond throwing someone under the bus.<br /><br />At this point, I have to say enough is enough.  This film is basically just one long, extended, endless, chase sequence.  Worse.  They present this version (of the same story!) in miniscule snippets that leave it feeling like a trailer teaser.  This miserable story jumps all over the place (and time) and is doled out with such secrecy that when it abruptly ended I was left with the sense that nothing was really accomplished.  This movie is filled with nothing but continuous subterfuge.  Liars lying to liars about secret programs and \\"sin eaters,\\" chromosome alterations, paid assassins belonging to heretofore unheard of secret programs, all with nifty names and decoder rings!  It's maddening.  It didn't help that the new bad guy (Edward Norton) was remarkably ineffectual as a mastermind.  The actor has no presence, especially when going toe to toe with someone like Stacy Keach.  The wolf was more menacing, and look what happened to it!<br />I will say the house `swarming' sequence was fun.  But this is the end of the line for me.  I can't imagine wanting to watch Jeremy Renner or Matt Damon running for their lives again in Bourne Whatever.

B009NY43NY|2.0|This book dragged on and on, like the author was just writing about nonsense and little tidbits that had nothing to do with the story, or just to extend an already weak storyline. I've been a SS fan, but this book was a big boring disappointment. She could have also gave Eric & Sookie's relationship a little more justice then she did. I don't know, I just felt like the story was a waste of time and an attempt to cash in on the loyal fans.
B007WFTFG6|3.0|If you purchase it free then it's only 1 of 4 parts unlocked. Then they want $1.39 more to unlock the rest, so it kept popping up until my 2 year old pressed on it and it automatically charged my credit card and you won't be able to cancel it . So watch out  because it  could be $139 instead. The app itself is all right for little kids to keep them busy and not scream their hearts out at the store or somewhere important.
B00498YZH8|5.0|You will be drawn into the story from the start and captivated until the end.  Teenager Ree Dolly needs to find her father, who has skipped bail and used their family's house and property as collateral.  If he doesn't show up for his court date, their house and property will be taken and the family, which includes Ree's mother, who is mentally ill, and her two little brothers, will be homeless.  Ree has a couple of weeks to find him or they lose everything.<br />  The fierce culture of the old families of the Ozarks and their codes of honor and traditions make Ree's search for her father increasingly dangerous. Will she be able to find him?  It's not clear until the end. Based on the book by the same name. Great script, photography and acting.  Actress Jennifer Lawrence is terrific as the young heroine.

B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|I am reminded by initial criticism to Radiohead's Kid A album when I look at the shallow and terse criticisms surrounding this album. I'm sure Daft Punk could have released another electronica album that didn't challenge them or force them to grow. I probably would have enjoyed it. However, Random Access Memories has shown that they are willing and able to operate outside of their comfort zone. This is an ambitious triumph that surpasses all the hype. It's been awhile since I've listened to an album where my favorite track changed more than 4 times. I honestly think Get Lucky is OK in comparison to the rest of the album. Granted, it could be because I got to listen to it first.<br /><br />This album cannot be recommended highly enough. Don't pirate it, don't ignore it, just get it.

B0063IH60K|4.0|Graphics are good. Several options as far as background pictures go. Only one type of game offered. Must download another app if you want spider solitaire, etc. I haven't had any problems with ads like other people have, but I have software for that.
0765325950|1.0|A Memory of Light is more about profit than art or literature. The wheel turns, and Tor and Harriet make more and more money. Do you really need all that money? Brandon Sanderson, a writer without half the talent of Robert Jordan, comes and goes, eats and stuffs his face, but there was one great writer of The Wheel of Time, but he is dead. And so, the memory of what once was, and what will never pass again, is slowly beginning to fade, not to myth or legend, but to something farcical, something average. In short, I hate this book and what it represents: Greed rather than artistic merit, an end rather than the end, and something close to mediocrity in the form of Brandon Sanderson, rather than mastery in the words of Robert Jordan. I hate, also, that Robert Jordan never lived to complete his opus magnum, because he, too, had succumbed to the caprices and charms of the success of his series and the riches it doubtless brought him. I suppose, with it, his widow would have bought him a nicer burial sight and a better, more opulent tombstone (heck, we all know RJ's particular proclivity for embellishment, no matter how wonderfully done). But I hate, most of all, that a rank amateur, by comparison, attempted to pen the last words of this great and classic series of books, The Wheel of Time, all for the vainglory of his own career and a bigger, fatter pay check that he hopes perpetuates for the rest of his days; not unlike an understudy to Michelangelo completing David, not the hands or the feet, but the head and what ought to have been the many perfectly crafted features of its age-old, meticulously created countenance, perfected over long years by the hand that gave it birth, that gave it life, that moved us to adoration and stirred our souls to the lofty heights of edification. By Robert Jordan's hand, deft and practiced and wise. Not by Brandon Sanderson's, maladroit and opportunistic and oh so very glutinous. I can't stand those chubby fingers of his that have indelibly marred this series with the stain of his own self-interest. I hate this book. I truly do. It is total dreck.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Thanks Amazon for allowing me to be able to afford &#34;Columbo&#34; The Complete Series on DVD.  I could not have gotten it at a better price.  The DVD's are Excellent as is Peter Falk as Columbo.  I have loved Columbo from its beginnings and still love it today.  Thanks again to Amazon.
B007LNJ4YW|5.0|My husband introduced me to this band knowing my love for female-fronted bands. At times, Beach House reminds me of Julee Cruise. Twin Peaks-esque but with their own uniqueness. I've been playing Bloom non-stop during my drive to and from work. The cd keeps getting better & better.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoyed this. great story line and fun to play. graphics were awesome on kindle fire!ready to play next one!
B00CBKLO52|5.0|Absolute favorite  for a grown up and child.Neat controls. Love all the features included in it. A fun download for anyone who loves remote control vehicles. Can't go wrong with this one.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I enjoyed the little piece I played Thoth it was full but still fun. It was puzzleing and story plot was good.
1451695195|4.0|Written by a neurosurgeon who understands numerous complicated issued, this doctor's view of heaven matches his ability to comprehend a deeper view of heaven than the ordinary person.  Gives me the impression that heaven is based on each person's particular desires for THEIR heaven.  Siimple and lovely for children, awesome for most adults and more intricate for those wanting a heaven to correspond with how they have spent their lives.
0142000655|5.0|Steinbeck's astonishing literary talent is on full display here.  Character development.  Descriptive narrative.  Metaphysical depth, and rhetorical beauty.<br /><br />This is a book to pick up and sip, like vintage wine.  It will appeal a bit less to the page-turning, \\"can't put it down\\" crowd.  Remember to keep an open mind and realistic expectations when approaching this book, and I guarantee you'll come away with an understanding of why Steinbeck won a Nobel Prize.<br /><br />If the land, buildings, trees, rocks, rivers could speak, they would probably tell a story a lot like this.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have enjoyed this game.  Fun and keeps your interest.  Worth the price.<br /><br />I put on my kindle fire.  Works great.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|it is awesome . my friend  show me this game and it was awesome. you get to play as iron man or any other tony stark invention. and you get to fly and defeat bad guys.  you guys should get it.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|Highly recommend this for any George Harrison fans. A more intimate look into his private life. Love the changes he made throughout his life and his spirituality.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|This is a movie that I can watch time and again and still enjoy.  I especially love the music and dancing.
B0068FZ1C8|4.0|This is a wonderful story about a young boy with a dream of becoming a dancer.  He starts at the bottom and works his way all the way to the top!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Easy, peasy, fun.  Love these games where I don't have to strain my brain.  Relaxing yet there's a purpose to keep you going.
0375842209|5.0|It might take you a hundred pages to get into it but once you're there, you won't put it down. Read it. It will change your life.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I have the app and I randomly can't use all of my different songs and I can only use the 1 song I had before I got the app and I think the makers/owners of the app should have an update so you can use all of your music.
0470424702|4.0|Clear, concise, concrete information. Easy to read. Many examples and other references. Along with workbook, excellent choice for non finance and helps in understanding each topic
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Started watching this series in the second season on TV, and decided to buy the first season.  Wonderful character development.  TV at its very best!
B0013XW2F4|5.0|It is great. I enjoy reading this book. Wow. Do I have enough words yet? Ugh I hate that u have to do this
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I was using the Garmin watch.  From time to time the Garmin is off.  Other players have Garmin watches and standing side by side we get different yardages.  The Bushnell Tour V2 has dialed in my game.
0670827592|5.0|I do wish the it had all the same language as the original text.  The new stuff could also be there.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|very educational and great for kids. I like it. it is very goal otiented too. great graphics and very colorful.
B001BIMYXQ|5.0|The only thing better than this extensive collection is to listen to each Eurythmics album first to last, each beginning to end and appreciate the vocal mastery of Annie Lennox (especially on the early albums) and the sonic mastery of David Stewart. An irreplaceable part of the musical fabric of the last 30 years.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game I deffidently recommend it.I play it every day of my life I just love it and you'll love it too.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Simply put, there is no other series that tells a story with such devotion and care that accurately portrays, not only historical events, but the individuals who unknowingly created them. The extra footage and vid-doc's contained, show how the actors interviewed, met and became close friends to the soldiers they were cast to be. And in the case of Bill Garniere, the resemblance is uncanny. It was after watching the series in its entirety (not for the first time, but the first time owning it) that I delved into the included docs and was truly moved to tears. These men, and the countless others not portrayed in this series, were true hero's, putting themselves on the line for their comrades time and time again. They escaped aid stations while carrying injuries to return to their brothers at the front. Yet it is not only heroic events that were immortalized in this series, but the fear and shell shock of individuals at all military, social and psychological levels, coming to terms with the horror and violence of witnessing war at the front line - all the while putting their lives on the line for leaders who were everything from supreme to downright ignorant.<br /><br />To discover now that so many band of brothers have passed away since the series first aired, brought more sadness to me, for I felt for a very short time, that I knew them. At least, I knew them as well as the director's wanted me to. Such is the quality of this production. There is nothing quite like it and I doubt ever will.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|This Blu-ray disk was a Mothers Day gift for my wife. She absolutely loves it. Rather than a film, this is the 2010 live stage production in London of the musical celebrating the 25th anniversary of its run at the Queen's Theater. If you enjoy Broadway musicals you will love this disk.
193700788X|5.0|While I admit I have my favorite books and characters in this series, I have enjoyed every Sookie story as written. It must be quite a challenge to keep readers engaged so fervently for so long! I feel Ms. Harris is somewhat a victim of her own wonderful writing and marvelous imagination to have elicited such dark and spiteful reviews. She strikes me as an eminently decent person who has taken her authorship to heart.  I don't know how the series could have ended other than it did. (There were certainly myriad clues along the way.).  Thank you, Ms. Harris, for creating Sookie as such an appealing character with whom I could vicariously experience a world that never would have existed without you!
B001BC2ZS6|4.0|I have chosen this rating because it might have been a short story but, it had me captivated. I love the way John Steinbeck writes. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone that enjoys a great read!!
B008YWY0HK|4.0|The movie was received new as advertised. The shipping time was also as advertised but did take the entire 7 days to receive. It made me nervous because it was a gift and was shipped directly to the recipient while visiting a third party. I was worried the movie would arrive after my daughter had left to go back to her home but it got there on the last day.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Was expecting to be annoyed at Abrams for changes and mistakes. Turns out Abrams can make very good movies. This is one. While I noticed the lapses in logic and continuity, and still don't like many of the little changes, (Star Trek phasers always were different from all other Sci Fi weapons in that they were beams, not blasters!!), they are all pushed aside by how enjoyable a movie Abrams has made. Wonder what he'll do next with it???????
B009NY43NY|5.0|I very much enjoyed reading this book, I like all of the characters. I don't know why the author is ending the series and am fairly disappointed about it.
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|I love talking tom and I play it on phones all the time but you have to have a speaker on your device so I got it for my kindle fire and I realised that kindle' s don't have speakers. DON'T  GET IT ON YOUR KINDLE WILL NOT WORK!!!!
B004P1JDJO|5.0|In this book, daniel open my view about what really motivates human being. He explains with examples so that non-psycologist can understand what he mean.<br />In this book i got many insights about what motivate myself, my company, and people around me.<br />He also gives toolkits for us to help us implement what we just read.<br /><br />It'a great book for individuals, parents, managers, and leaders.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Hot and heavy at first..then I want sue I wanted to finish....so glad I did now I need the last book...can't get  enough of Eva and Gideon
B000001EGE|5.0|Very fine Cd from early Elton John. Well worth to check out and pick up. Great timeless ballads as good as it gets.
B007REV4YI|4.0|Excellent movie great action and photography. The story content is in the 007 tradition and this sequel proved not to be a disappointment.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|AMAZING!!!  INCREDIBLE!!! AWESOME!!! GET IT!!!<br /><br />At this point, I put J J Abrams at the top of the list for Director and Film Producer.  This guy knows how to find incredible acting talent, and put together an amazing film.  Next up, he's going to be Directing Star Wars.  I just cannot wait to see how he improves those films.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A wonderful story that allows you to escape the petty and unimaginative realities that are so popular today.  Let your imagination ignite and soar.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|This product works excellent!  Connect it to your computer using a USB port, add a SD card and ready to transfer slides and/or negatives to a jpeg file on your computer.  That simple after a few minutes of figuring out how to use it.  Instructions was difficult to follow but wasn't that difficult to figure out how it worked.
034580404X|5.0|I seriously compare this book to the twilight series in terms of forbidden love, and the cheesiness of it all.  obviously the sex scenes make this an adult novel. And I do think that some of the phrases are extremely repetitive, but at the same time, this book is being told from the perspective of a 21 year old! It reads perfectly into the mind of a young woman! I heard about this trilogy when it came out (2011 I think) and I never picked it up because I thought it would be heavy erotica. boy was I wrong! these books are nothing more than teen romance novels with sex scattered sporadically. I read all three in 2 days! I just couldn't stop until I knew how it ended- and I was so happy I wasn't disappointed!<br /><br />I think the two main reason these books are so popular are (1) women can see  themselves in Ana and live vicariously through her to escape the mundane that is life (moms, boring jobs, etc ) and (2) it makes us want to explore our kinky sides! The first book was more intense with all the bondage, dom-sub content and whatnot, but the 2nd and 3rd were really not so bad, and they make sex toys, hand cuffs and the like a little less taboo to think or even talk about. I wonder how many women aere more apt to be sexually creative after these books, and how many went and bought Ben Wa balls! hehe<br /><br />E.L. James, women of the universe salute you! and... the men are just plain grateful!<br /><br />just a side note, the Inner Goddess tidbits were my favourites!
B00CW665VI|4.0|Classic! Funny, witty, and charming! This one's a keeper! Drew is charming successful and very funny! In need of a love reality check. Kate ready and willing to give it to him! This story made me laugh a-lot.....you must read it to find out why! :))
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|So entertaining omg I love it. Good graphics, great gameplay, and a nice storyline. Love the kunoichi most so far~
1554512115|1.0|I was delighted to find this cardboard version of a Bob Munsch book for my grandson. The only problem was the book arrived warped. It doesn't smell or look otherwise damaged but it certainly was anything from flat. It's been sitting under a weight for a month and it's almost flat.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|It's okay, just kind of dull and a bit monotonous ya feel. Downloaded it for someone else and they love it so success I suppose?
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is my first review after many many books.  This story pulls you in from the beginning drawing you into the  characters lives.  Its futuristic setting sets the stage for a community that uses horrific means to police its people?  This story has something for everybody!  Enjoy!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Repetitive with the words you get sometimes, and I don't really have anyone else to play with so it's a waste of memory on my kindle really.
1476734941|5.0|I have been using this for about two and half months. So far lost 22 pounds. Getting used to less food. Like the fact that even on the two fast days, I can still have around 600 calories. Do not feel like i'm starving myself. Feel great.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|Kind of dull, monotonous, and mildly confusing. It doesn't have straightforward direction or guidance but the graphics make up for that
B0049A9BSY|5.0|This sequel is even better than the 1st one plus is a good movie for men who likes to watch Kim Cattrall Sarah Jessica Parker & Kristin Davis acting on this Sex & the City movie they're great
B005HSL626|4.0|Who doesn't love seeing fruit bleed everywhere?! My only concern is it slows my kindle down sometimes. Aside from that, great!
B00004RJ71|5.0|what can I say........this is a great old classic movie.  A movie that you remember and quote the lines.  I hadn't seen it in a long time, so it was fun to watch again
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|But the app kept removing itself from my kindle fire and I had to redownload the Times and start over and it pissed me off
B00280LYIC|5.0|I do not like reading at all. But this book was a amazing story!!! I would recommend it to parents to get their kids to read because it will change everything!!!!  Yes I may be in the 6th grade but I truly love this book I am so amazed by it I want to read the whole series!!!!!!!  BTW the movie is nothing like the book!!!!!!!! The book is way better!!
B0018RFLQ2|1.0|I was really excited to watch this title and was disappointed at how difficult it was to hear the video well in some parts. My sound system is not the best, but I can usually turn it up to hear the quiet parts. With this video, I was unable to \\"turn it up.\\" Love this movie...just wish I could hear the Instant video format.
B008XBCJ34|2.0|Ordered 3 movies from 3 different places all at the same time first 2 got hear 3 day before schedule ..the one I  ordered hear took 5 day just to leave the wear house and I'm still waiting wouldn't mind except I paid for the shiping. Never have I ever waited this long for a package this is crazy they must be delivering this by bike!
0312323867|5.0|I received this book ahead of schedule, I was on vacation in hawaii and couldn't wait after finishing \\"something blue\\" to read this sequel. So was happy to get it just a few days after I ordered it and in perfect condition as the seller described. Thank you!
B000022TSW|5.0|I just watched this movie, and I also just got done watching all 16 seasons so far that south park has to offer.  Very very very good!!!!!
B007FDE4Y8|1.0|I bought this item after deliberating on which steadicam to get for months.  Initially, I was really happy about this product.  It worked great for its price, and it looked incredibly professional and well made.  While it took probably 3 hours to calibrate (like the reviews I had read told me it would take that long) I was really happy with the end result.  I could never get it 100% but hey, I made it work.<br /><br />I used this thing maybe.. 3 times? Officially used it? Not for like practice or testing it.  And that's when this item went to crap.  I swear to anyone reading this, I did not damage or misuse my product.  I used it exactly the way you were supposed to and used it hardly at all.  Bolts began coming lose regardless of how I tightened them, for instance the thing that holds the camera to the stabilizer refused to go on all of the way.  I had to cram an index card in the between in order for it to work.  Even then, the metal piece that's supposed to NEVER come off began coming off when I tightened it.  Leaving the camera to slide around uncontrollably.<br /><br />I refused to give up, I was going to make this thing work because it created beautiful shots for my movies.  So I would place one hand on the camera as well to make sure it wouldn't fall.  That's when the entire core piece would move.  Like you put your hand on it and would wiggle when it wasn't supposed to.  That wasn't controlled by any form of bolt, that piece wasn't supposed to be wiggling.  And Because of this wiggling if I tilted it in the direction of gravity one way, the entire thing would go out of wack and my hours of calibration went useless.<br /><br />I still made it work. I had to! It created great shots! I put it in the trunk of my car and got to our filming spot.  I take the thing out by the handle (The part you're supposed to hold it by) and the bolts snapped.  This piece, again, is not a piece I'm supposed to put together.  It's the handle attached the the whole thing that makesit work.<br /><br />If you're reading this and thinking, \\"Well, there are other good reviews here! It has a decent overall rating!\\" Don't think that way. I did, big mistake.  And if you think that I didn't know how to use this product or that I mistreated the item, don't.  I give you my word I really didn't, I treat my camera gear like my children.<br /><br />Long story short, If you see an exotic Ferrari on the internet for sale for only $1000, don't buy it. Chances are, it isn't going to work like a Ferrari should.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This game is so much fun. It takes a little getting used to, but not to difficult to figure out. I like the bright colored tiles. Challenging, but not discouraging.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Worth the 1.99. Lots of great puzzles with a hint of creepiness. I'm looking forward to the sequel, if they make it.
B004Y042N8|4.0|My two girls love playing on my wife's phone and this seems to keep their attention and focus for a solid 10-15 minutes.
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|I only get FAOTD apps. And only ones with acceptable permissions which today seem to be few and far between anymore.<br /><br />But there have been a bunch of apps lately that have acceptable permissions and change them after they are the FAOTD. Obviously I refuse to update but others need to be notified. Since I've now got a new phone, I'm going to lose the list of these offenders so I'm going through and doing it today.<br /><br />New Permissions:<br /><br />* Google Play Billing service, view network state

B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I'm too sleepy to write a review with any real substance because I was up until 4am reading this book. I absolutely could not put it down and spent the last hour reading it crying (in a good, romance novel way).  After I'm done with this excuse for a review I'm going to buy all the rest of the books in the series.<br /><br />So yeah, it's good. Read it. But start it in the afternoon or early evening if you need to get up the next morning. :)

B005S9EKCW|5.0|Liked the stage version, Like the Movie.  Although some of the music on the movie didn't thrill me as much as the Stage version did.  Some parts are completely missing from this version, for example, toward the end, when Jon is dieing, and the girls are singing together on Stage, only mom sings in the movie version.  I miss the harmony of all three girls singing.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game. The best. I recommend this game.. can't put it down. I play everyday. I try to get as many bingo as possible in every game.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Obviously they're going to make another movie out of this book.  Although, they could have finished it in one movie, which I think they should have.  There really isn't that much left to put into a second movie.  Having said that, I still loved this movie.  They didn't deviate too much from the original book, which is always a good thing in a movie...
B008476HBM|5.0|A wonderful classic! It is a great read and timeless. The characters are exciting to follow. Elizabeth is a wonderful character. Smart,strong yet kind and thoughtful.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Captivating account of the hunt for UBL<br />Great details about life as a US navy seal and the prep for the mission. Mirrors the details of zero dark thirty.
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|This movie is so hilarious!  My younger son didn't like Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs (he was scared of the Dinosaurs)  He LOVES this one.  Granny makes the movie!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I am sure I hardly need to say anything here but if you are reading this and wonder if you should buy this book, then I will try to help. This book is set in a fantasy wold that starts off very mundane but slowly, stronger and stronger fantasy undertone seep into the story making it feel like a wold on the brink of change. However the strongest aspect of the this story is the character. The characters have a lot of depth and even when the story lags a little I had to keep reading to find out what would happen to the characters.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's angry birds... might make you angry when you can't get your three stars on each level sometimes, but it's angry birds :)
B004K8WPUQ|4.0|I really wish that they could make a stereo version of this mic and it was a bit &#34;sturdier&#34; like some metal casing and bracket, but the gain function is awesome, the levels are clean, and it's light.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|At least on my kindle... facebook doesn't seem like it wants to update the newsfeed. I don't know what is going on with it. I've deleted it from the kindle device and the cloud and reloaded it back on, same thing.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this game I been playing it all day. I couldn't even want to sleep. Very good game. I think you have to post a lot on facebook but its fine.
B00BQ1DAHC|3.0|Solid CD if you've been listening to them for awhile.  It's a bit different from their previous albums in regards to &#34;how&#34; heavy the songs are, but still enjoyable.<br /><br />The thing that corks me is that they had extra songs on a Best Buy exclusive release for the same album.  I took a star off just for that.  Seriously, if you limit extra content to ensure people buy it at an inflated price at another vendor, I lose respect for you.  This is why people pirate.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Only way I have found to download Youtube videos to watch at you convenience.<br />It does seem to make me log in quite often, but that is a small price to pay.<br />Download with your Wi-fi and watch them whenever you want.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone. I already had a camera case. A very nice one. But I was looking for something easier to tote around. This fit my needs perfectly.This backpack was actually more than I expected. Because of the price I definitely thought it would be on the cheap side. I was extremely surprised at the quality & space. In my opinion this is a excellent product. THANK YOU very much!
B0057H0H4K|5.0|Great album. Great price. Great job!!! This seller gets a triple 5 star rating. I can never get enough of The Beatles. Just great!!!!
B001TXWJ4M|3.0|You have to be a real fan to love this series. After the first season I saw two more episodes then I got bored.
B00064X3FE|5.0|One of the albums of 1975 that we listened tro constantly. Thgis album propelled him into sheer super-star status. Captain Fantasic was truly a great body of work, and it still gets air time on the radio. Just wonderfull!!! CD arrived so fast as well. Well packaged too. This seller deserves a triple 5 stars to their  fantastic work.
B00BI745AA|4.0|Though I'm not a musical fan, this was very good. I was surprised that the voices of the actors were not bad, and the acting was very good.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book..couldn't stop reading it. It is an easy read..I can't wait for the movie to come out
B00321MGPG|3.0|IF have to be rally bored to like this movie or you are dying to see what's happening to the world but the cinematography is superb.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is a darling of a film. The characters, Their circumstances, and how they rise to challenges are all engaging and deeply infused with charm.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This is one of the best mini series I've seen. It has a realism about it and the acting is very good.
B006H5120E|5.0|It's Titanic, like you have never scene before!!!! It's almost like you were actually there! Almost totally immersed in the movie!!! Very well Done!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|The last 5 minutes of this movie made up for the entire thing, so don't give up on it like I almost did.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|The 3D aspect of the film makes it so much better than the original!!!!!!!!! The flight scenes are amazing and, sharp!
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|The cinematography was phenomenal but the story was a bit immature, so this would be a great movie for kids.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Th  book is really good. Like I have a book club and we are reading this wonderful book. It  Amazing and I hope everyone reads it
B00821OX98|2.0|Stupid, unrealistic. You name it, as it was awful. The aliens were fake, the military wasn't even close to real, and the story of aliens attacking earth is getting more and more stupid.
B004SKLD9A|4.0|pretty silck.  came out of the years following the original 'matrix' movie.  far less philosophical.  less fashionable.  another turn on the dystopian future-imperfect.  worth the buy for the fight scenes and special effects.
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|It was an interesting movie, though not as funny as it is advertised, but worth $4.00. 4 more words I don't have
B007REV4T8|3.0|thought this was better than quantam, it definitely falls short of casino.  it really does just leave one with a somewhat empty feeling.  its kinda like a segway, lead-in to (hopefully) better things.
B0012QRPU4|3.0|Season one was intriguing, and I watched it all but after two episodes of season two I got really bored.
B004HO6HWA|3.0|it was an ok remake of the bronson movie.  could've been done better...but that's not statham's fault.  could've been more clever and less overtly predictable.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|Best performance of Helen Hunt yet. She is my favorite actress now that I've seen this movie. What a gutsy lady!
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|the movie was good...but this story is getting waaaay to drawn out and flooded with filler.<br />by the time we get to movie 3, i'd expect the audience to have left the house.<br />sometimes LotR felt ruushed or like pieces were missing...this one feels the exact opposite extreme of that.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|These two actors can make any movie great. Though it was a slow starter it turned out to be very interesting.
B00B69UQJY|4.0|not their best, not their worst.  somewhat about their average, which makes it pretty good.  still pretty much worth the buy.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|My favorites are Unbelievers and Diane Young, of course. Can't wait til they come to Tulsa so I can see them live!
B0006AAS5G|4.0|Very nice watch. It is just a bit on the heavy side but he wears it daily and says it is very comfortable.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Got my tickets to see them in Tulsa before they sold out WITHIN 5 MINUTES! Crazy good, folks. Don't miss out.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I enjoy the graphics and background music, very soothing.  My only complaint is that it keeps bubbling me about upgrading or getting things with pearls that I'd have to buy because there's not a quicker way to get enough.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I play it every time I have nothing to do, which is like all the time! :) :) :) :) :)
B002CSC5EC|4.0|Not quite how I remembered it, but I haven't seen it since it was released.  Definitely more talking than music.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This album is so full of soul, it it just so pleasant to listen to.<br />Sometimes all we need is a little old school nowadays.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Works better and easier than other apps. It has a great interface and the presentation is excellent.<br />Hope you can add more functionality to the app.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|Just when you thought Rock n' Roll was dead along comes this 19 year old kid from England with a fresh new sound. He is the best thing that has happen in YEARS and this C.D. is the greatest!!!! He writes his own songs an sings like Bob Dylan, Elvis and Jonny Cash. Buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00009YNGB|2.0|Besides the problems with the online store that bought, The CD came in all the time that is given, the audio is perfect, but the cover art this game. Expected to be better delivery of something that should be very careful when sending.
B003DTLUFO|4.0|Black Rock Shooter is one of my 6 nendoroids I have bought on amazon. She is well painted and well made like every other nendoroid I've purchased. I only have one issue, her hair falls out really easily that is the only reason I gave it 4 stars other that she is great she has a lot of accessories and she is super cute.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|When I first tried this game, I thought the controls would be hard, but when I started, I caught on quickly! It is extremely addictive! I play it on my kindle fire, and the details an  graphics are AMAZING!! One thing I think this game should have is powerups, like head start or double coins. I also think you should be able to change what person is in the car, like in the tank, there could be a soldier driving it instead of the default person. Thanks, hope this helped!
B00004Y6NP|5.0|One of the best CDs to show off your new speakers to friends & family. The music is great and never gets old.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great. Kids have so much fun taking care if the horse. Great way to show responsibility and kindness.
B0074YVW1G|4.0|I've known and been assessed many times as an introvert, throughout a productive and successful corporate career. This book was probably read far too late for me, but affirms what I know about myself. I found it overly long, hence the 4 star rating - a lot of research and findings are extremely interesting but a little similar.<br /><br />I wasn't fully assisted, however. The book goes into the care and education of introverts through our schooling systems, and gives a couple of examples - both good and bad, of how extroverted parents have brought up an introverted child. It also highlights the communication and understanding issues between an extrovert and introvert as a couple. However, I happen to be married to another introvert, who has also pushed through with a passion to build a successful corporate career. Communicating as a long-term intro-intro couple takes on a whole new dynamic. As does the fact that we appear to be the parents of an extroverted child. The book doesn't offer advice on that criteria.<br /><br />I did find the area on high-reactive and brain research very helpful, as it offered an explanation for my own over-sensitivity to music and some film or movie emotions. The research into our cubicled groupthink world was also incredibly liberating. I would highly recommend that all introverts and extroverts coupled with them would find a lot of understanding in reading Quiet, and gifting it on to family members.
B0063IH60K|5.0|What's not to like? It's solitaire - something to do when you've got nothing else to do. I enjoy playing this version.
B004LP3AYI|4.0|what the heck is wrong with it that i am not able to buy/download this book, i jst fimished the frist oone and a eager to start the second but i am not able to purchase it :(
B003OPUZYY|5.0|YET ANOTHER GREAT BRITISH BLUES CD BY ALVIN LEE AND 10 YEARS AFTER...ANOTHER GEM!! GREAT ADDITION TO MY CD/RECXORD COLLECTION...GET IT!
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is like therapy. Even the background music is relaxing. Lotsa fun going on each quest.<br />I really enjoy this game.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|This is just what I ordered love it, thank you:)<br />I don't have more words to say about this ..
B00B9LNJ9I|2.0|Her last few albums have left something to be desired. I am waiting for the time where I have listened to it enough to maybe like it. Definitely not like her first two albums where every song was a hit from the start.
147674355X|5.0|If you ask, do you feel sad when reading this book - Yes, I feel<br />If you ask, if you cried when reading this book - Yes, I cried<br />If you ask, do you feel your heart ache when reading this book - Yes, I feel sick at all<br />But if you ask, do you \\"feel\\" what is really felt by \\"Karen, Hope and Les\\" - No, I do not and even don't understand how that hit their soul, the mind, the body ....<br /><br />Sometimes I still can not imagine how someone could hurt another person. When we are not intentionally hurting one of our body, even just our fingers, we feel very painful especially when people with all the power that their own to hurt you, maybe even when they did not realize they were hurt you, kind of having mental disorders, which until now I still do not understand how can??<br /><br />I'm probably not going to review this book but I wanted to express what I could say some things that I want to share with you about this book:<br /><br />3 womens have experienced the same thing from one \\"man\\". Sometimes I felt how cruel a \\"man\\" can act :<br /><br />\\"Les\\" who eventually committed suicide ..<br />\\"Hope\\" that eventually forgotten but still bring traumas that even she was not aware of what was happening to her ..<br />Karen who eventually went on to live and act ..<br /><br />* Imagine your life without a tv, phone / tel, internet .. I'm confused why there's a folk can live without all of them * unbelievable ... how boring life. But who would have thought there was something behind it.<br /><br />Which Sky do not have a tv, phone / tel, internet even have to go to public school like other girls, was not allowed, just home school. Until she was 17 years.<br /><br />And funny thing is when he befriended with a gay who presented e-reader at her birthday<br /><br />Holder which again, you will find in any novel, the type of hero who is very charming, always you can count on, always protecting you and will always keep you tied to it.<br /><br />And would be very unfortunate if you have never tried to read this book<br /><br />You are awesome Collen Hoover and I \\"live\\" you :)nate if you have never tried to read this book<br /><br />You are awesome Collen Hoover and I \\"live\\" you :)
0060987464|5.0|Being a huge Marilyn Manson fan, this was a must have. I love the all around writing style and how personal it gets. The only thing that would make it better would be a second book from where this one left off.
B00AEUU4LQ|4.0|Shuffling back and forth in time has to be one of the more difficult literary techniques. Hosseini has proved that he can make it work. This book scores on many levels. It is not another typical Afghanistan war tear jerker. These stories can happen anywhere with anyone give or take a few changes. The way the book ties the characters together is really commendable, even though I found one or two unnecessary. Pari, Abdullah, Nabi and Markos were my favourites. Moving away, immigration, asylum...which ever name we give it, the loss of ones homeland always stays in the background. We can never sever the past as without it we can never realize any future.
B000001Y2U|5.0|I'm a huge, and I mean huge, Marilyn Manson fan. I finally got around to ordering this album and loved it. I of course had already listened to most of the songs, but it's somehow better once you actually own it. It may not be my favorite album of theirs, but I love the unique sound of it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great oh yeah a little confusing but awesome hi I love me totally worth free good bye from Lindsay
B004ZJZPXY|5.0|LOVE, love, love this movie. Hilarious. &#34;For the greater good.&#34; You will be in stiches over this film. Love Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as a duo. So worth it.
B0013ND30M|5.0|Sleeping Beauty is one of my personal favorite Disney films next to ''Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs''. Sleeping Beauty is a beautiful and colorful movie with lovely songs. The three fairies are so sweet and lovable, and they are major characters in the story.<br /><br />The movie is about a king and queen who have a daughter. They call her Aurora. During a ceremony celebrating the birth of the Princess, three sweet fairies named Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather bless the Princess with a different gift each. When Merryweather is about to bless the Princess, an evil fairy named Maleficent appears at the ceremony. She then curses the Princess. She casts a spell and says that before the sun sets on her 16th birthday she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel, and then she will die. Maleficent escapes, then Merryweather must bless the Princess with a gift that will be able to save her. She casts a spell saying that when she pricks her finger, she will only sleep, and when she gets a kiss from a true love, the spell will break.<br /><br />The fairies then take the Princess away from the King and Queen to hide her. They spend 16 years with her and live as normal humans without magic, and they call her Briar Rose. On the Princess's 16th birthday, she goes in the forest and meets a Prince, but she doesn't know he is one, and he doesn't know she's the Princess. They fall in love, but then she rushes back home and tells him to meet her there at night.<br /><br />The fairies then have to bring the Princess back to the castle and they tell her who she really is. When she is in the castle, Maleficent takes control of her and she pricks her finger on a spindle. The fairies then put everyone in the castle to sleep until the Princess can be awakened. While this is happening, Maleficent kidnaps the Prince.<br /><br />The fairies go to the forbidden mountain and free the Prince, then they give him a sword and shield. He must then destroy Maleficent and save the Princess.<br /><br />I have seen this movie many times. This is not only a great Disney film, but a great sword and sorcery fantasy film as well.
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|Enjoyable to watch.  The cast did a great job and the story line was easy to follow. It was easy to view on my iPhone.
B001AQT11M|5.0|Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs is one of the best animated films of all time. A terrific movie that has been known to be both enjoyable and frightening. It is a film with a whole range of emotions. It has beautiful songs and great writing.<br /><br />This movie also has one of the best and most evil Disney villains.<br /><br />The film is based on a German fairy tale by The Brothers Grimm. It is about a Princess named Snow White who lives with her evil stepmother, The Queen. The Queen fears that one day Snow White's beauty might surpass her own. So she dresses Snow White in rags and makes her work as a servant in the castle. The Queen has a magic mirror which she speaks to and asks it who is the fairest in the land. The mirror however tells her that rags won't hide Snow White's beauty, and that Snow White is more fair than her.<br /><br />The Princess meets a Prince whom she falls in love with, but the Queen becomes jealous and demands her huntsman to kill Snow White and bring her heart back to her to prove it.<br /><br />When the huntsman is about to kill the Princess, he realizes he can't do it, and he begs for her to forgive him. He tells her to run away because the Queen wants her dead. In a panic, Snow White runs through the forest and she sees many scary creatures that grab at her. Most of it is because she is scared, and her imagination is taking over. She then falls to the ground and starts crying. The creatures she saw were simply forest animals. When she looks up, she apologizes to them saying she was just frightened. They then take her to a cottage in the woods where she can live, but the cottage is the home of seven dwarfs who work in a diamond mine.<br /><br />Snow White cleans the house with the animals, then she falls asleep. When the dwarfs return, we get a lot of cute and funny scenes between the Princess and the sweet dwarfs.<br /><br />The rest of the film is about the Queen creating a disguise using magic, and going after Snow White. The movie has a beautiful and happy ending that made me cry.<br /><br />The movie is extremely well written, has great voice acting, and the animation is spectacular. It is a great film for absolutely everyone.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Omg this book was so funny..I love the way Emma chase wrote it from a guys point of view and how he was actually talking to the reader..I really loved the humor and the story was fun and sexy.i couldn't get enough I read the book in one day couldn't  put it down
B00B2GK4KW|5.0|Excellent paper punch which is easy to use with beautiful end product. I have made some stunning cards with it.
B00CNGA1PS|5.0|This is definitely the best podcast app.  Easy interface and great selection of podcasts.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone
B00000IWVS|5.0|Argerich's performance of Chopin's piano sonata in B minor is just beautiful, so alive and passionate - and to me it achieves this without sounding in any way brash or unbalanced. I prefer this over another performance by Argerich of the same piece (the 1967 recording released by Deutsche Grammophon) even though the latter is also excellent. Whether you are an Argerich fan, or just a fan of good quality classical/romantic piano music, I highly recommend adding this album to your collection.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This is a great book and should be given many awards. I thought that the beginning was a little dull. Also I would recommend this for older readers because its fair share of blood and gore
1451668945|5.0|All of her books are very interesting to read and I pass them onto my daughters to read also.  They also enjoy reading them. Will purchase more in the future.
B005D51II0|5.0|Anyone enjoy listening to classical this set is sure to make you stay at home and listen to it .Recording is great nice clarity and dynamics.
B00004Y6O4|1.0|The CD that I Got that promised Digitally Remastered is a complete FAKE.  It was advertised as NEW yet it arrived without a seal and when I play the CD there is only like one minute of the first two songs and the rest of the CD is blank.  What a rip off!!  I will NEVER order from this company again!!
B000YDDUIW|4.0|just like the vinyl and with less noise and portable.  Great album originally, great cd now.  Well worth the buy if you like the Eagles.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Sometimes easy, other times tedious.  All in all, a real brain teaser, not to mention beautiful 3D renderings of each puzzle and pieces.  Think you're pretty smart?  This puzzle will challenge most everyone!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Well worth yur time to watch this well written, suburbly acted series. It is thoroughly enchanting. Have watched season three twice and enjoyed it more each time.
B00B1OWEVC|3.0|It's not as good as their first ep, but it's tons better than their second ep. It's solidly in the middle.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Now I don't have to drag out my laptop when I feel like pinning :)Having Pinterest available on my Kindle Fire HD is great. It works really well on my Kindle.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|What a brave and courageous young lady. I can't imagine going threw what she had to go threw. I just can't believe that in all those years not a single parole officer thought to check out every inch of property when making a home visit! I sure hope they have changed some rules in that department and they are being followed. I also hope that those parole officers that didn't follow threw were reported and replaced. I hope they think about the years of torture this poor girl went threw.<br /><br />Kimberly Denton<br />Waco, Tx
B0010SEMP0|5.0|I love the entire Bones and Cat series. The characters are laugh out load funny but at the same time you are able to relate to them.
078881172X|5.0|So glad I found this video on Amazon.  It is a keepsake limited edition and my kids loved it and now my grand kids.  Thank you for great shipping and handling too.<br />Yours truly--Faye
B005K17RU0|2.0|Apps works OK but has heavy battery use.No way to stop auto update feature. Also lots of pop ups. Why do we have to use 20 words if one or two say all that's needed!
B0087EACJK|4.0|I enjoy playing this game, like version 1 of it, but there is something that I dislike about it that I can't identify. I simply can't play it for more than 15 minutes. And it is not that I get bored or that the puzzles are hard, no, but there is something that kills my interest after a while. For that reason I dropped one star.
B000VX042U|4.0|I have had several pairs of these before.  Quality of construction is not quite what it used to be, but still pretty good overall.  Wish they made this product with a smoother sole rather than the lug sole, so my wife would not complain so much about dragging mud etc. into the house.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|Amazing, addictive, great UI, awesome graphics, nice sounds (although they are a lil bit loud), challenging... This is a good game, I definitely recommend it without an hesitation.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I have finally found a rap album that I adore from beginning to end. Saw these guys performing at the 2013 Billboard Awards (on TV- I live in Azania), and was blown away by the unique take on the genre. Next day I am de-fragging in a music store, and what do I find? The Heist! I was meant to have it! I am so happy.This is so creative, original, beautifully written, perfectly executed, artistic (musically, sonically and lyrically).  Mr Macklemore's voice is just perfect for the music, and the backing vocals equally so. The percussion is killer and makes you feel like dancing. I can't stop listening to this and so enjoy listening to it in my car. Feel like 'King of the Road' speeding about the city while this  is playing. Oh, and not not only does it make me feel aesthetically uplifted, it also makes me feel 30 years younger - I am a 57-year-old geyser who normally gets high on Hendrix, Dylan and the Zep etc. Hahaaaa! Thanks Mrs Macklemore & Lewis. Get it. Hurry.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so much fun! My husband and I love it! We are constantly trying to beat each other's best distance!<br />I was not sure if I'd like this kind of game, expecting it to be repetitious; but it's not. No matter how many times I start, it's never the exact same map. And the further you go the more challenging it becomes.<br />This is the best free game I have ever seen or played. And I haven't really noticed any ads so far! Which is a plus.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|Very good movie, lots of action, excellent acting, a potentially scary glimpse into our future? And Natalie is easy on the eyes :)
0679805273|5.0|I bought this book for each of my kids to have their teachers sign every year so I can present it as a graduation present.  I love this book!!
B002JVWR4A|3.0|The only issue with the DVD is one episode has no volume at all. Disk 3 &#34;the X in the file&#34;. Other wise its fine.
B009AJDDQU|4.0|I like it but would like more action, i hope they continue with this to see the evolution of Alien
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is hilly recommended sorry about my spelling but this is one of the best games I've ever played five stars!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Graphics are a lot better than I expected and the storyline/puzzles are keeping me interested. However you only get to play about 6 parts to it then you have to pay to finish.
B00594XOZU|4.0|This app is so easy to work and it sends messages fast. You can also send pics. The only thing that I would put as a con is that we can't send videos like you can on a phone. It they add that this app will be 100% perfect.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is wonderful,insightful, and has a wide range of vocabulary. That it why I've chosen to give it five stars. I loved both of the main characters Steele and Grey. I wish it would've explained more in depth of Elliott and Kate's relationship. This book ended on such a cliff hanger that I am bewildered and quite frankly a little upset. I sincerely hope that fifty shades darker (part two) picks up where this one left off. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone under the age of 14. Details are much too vivid for anyone younger than that. But if your an adult, read this book, it'll have you begging for more.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|other then the fact that they added stuff and its made into 3 parts I loved this movie!!! Can not wait till the second installment!
1554072840|5.0|My girls grew up with this book. They read it constantly and made the potty training experience so much easier.  Works great.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I liked this book it was entertaining and thought provoking, although I think it went a little long,unlike this review.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This was a good book, for the most part.  It tended to drag in places but still managed to keep my attention most of the time.<br /><br />When the boy was exonerated after a very long court case and the family decided to take a much-needed get-away vacation, the book turned more upbeat again.<br /><br />However, not wishing to give away the ending of the story, I was truly disappointed with the author's choice of ending the book.  What a major letdown!  Guess I prefer happy endings.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It's nice to read a romance that happens within marriage. Stories likes these are too few. It's worth the read.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Thank you for having in kindle, and I have been involved with hill climb game for a long time in cellphone
B008D37J6O|1.0|I thought this would help with youtube videos on my tablet but I was wrong. Needs more, its just like any other player.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|Tin Tin is  a fun adventure mystery for young and old.  Interesting characters, great adventure and plenty of mystery and suspense.  Should be fun whether you are familiar with Tin Tin or not.  Neat GCI images - very lifelike!  Loved that dog Snowy!!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Best notebook app ever IMHO. Love the personalization and the fact that I can create endless notebooks. Feature rich and user friendly. Not just &#34;another notebook.&#34; Very creative guys. Thanks.
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|Charlotte Bronte's novel has been adapted so many times for the cinema that it becomes difficult to distinguish between various versions.  Orson Welles' Mr. Rochester sticks in the mind, not so much for its closeness to what Bronte might have imagined, but for its sheer bravura.  Charlotte Gainsbourg's Jane Eyre was a waif with a surprising strength of character.  This version has a winsome performance by Mia Wasikowska as the eponymous heroine; an innocent trying to make her way in a world apparently peopled by sadists and rapacious men.  Michael Fassbender turns in a one-note characterization of Rochester; all smoldering eyes and winsome expressions, he wheedles his way into Jane's heart to such an extent that she cannot forget him.  The ending is a bit of a cop-out, as Jane reunites with the (now-blind) Rochester in a gesture of reconciliation, without there being any justification for such a move.  Rochester in the main behaves despicably, as does Jamie Bell as Rivers.  The film contains the usual visual clich&eacute;s associated with costume drama - old houses, period costumes and slow-moving shots of the landscape in vivid autumn colors.  It's nice to look at, but hardly memorable.
B004UIOUHC|3.0|Runs well on my Colby tablet but does not run as fast as the native browser for some reason. I will still keep it however for the features of the O.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|For me this was another snatch & paste nonsense saga set in the South.  Leonardo DiCaprion supperb for the poorly put together pieces of a Movie.  Jamie Foxx over done and not believable in his role and over the top accessories.  What has happend to writers in the last couple of decades.  Junk in Junk out.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works well. I don't own a kindle but this app works well on every Android device I've ever owned, even cheap ones. Phone or tablet. I even have it on my laptop. Although I do have other ebook readers, this is my go to app most of the time because of the huge and unusual assortment of reading material on Amazon. Lots of free content as well.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|A great app.  Just like the real book you can look up words and their meanings and spelling.  Exactly what I would expect from Merriam-Webster, but beyond as well.  Easy to use and helpful as well as useful.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Very convenient app to have on phone or tablet. Works well on my Nitro and Colby tablet. Was glitchy at first but has improved significantly.
B00B22IJXK|1.0|It was not what I expected. I thought I was going to get to add things to the picture's but was only able to draw and it looked like I was using a crayon.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is one of those games where you tell yourself one more try then I'll stop and the next thing you know an hour has passed and you're late for a meeting that was supposed to start 30 minutes ago. Now your ex is going to get sole custody of your kids and you'll never see them again. Before you know it your ex is dating a jerk named Bill and your kids are calling him daddy while you sit in a cold living room dimly lit by a 25 watt bulb in a lamp with no lampshade on it with your kindle in your hand while you try to improve your score and beat your distance from a previous run so you can unlock another level. Super fun game!!!!
B008K6HN8I|1.0|confusing  and not at all what I expected. for someone with a little more knowledge than I maybe it would work good, but not me .
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Never a dull moment  this season kept my on the edge  I would recommend this to anyone who requires an extra jolt in their coffee  excised about the following seasons
B0067R0APK|5.0|This is very useful and I used it often on trip to Wis. and help me there as well as my home.
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|Highly recommend this movie to everybody! That's one of those life changing movies. I just ordered 5th copy of this DVD (from the same seller), since all my friends who saw it wants to keep the copy for themselves.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|I put this on my Kindle and helps to keep battery up to par and tells you how much charge is on it as well as how many hours are left I probably will put this on my phone when I get a new one , I want a smartphone soon.
B004ZG5EYC|5.0|We absolutely love this movie funny beautifully filmed and a great film to watch again. Definitely would suggest to own. Glad its now in our collection.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Got this for my kindle and the graphics are superb and HD makes  them so much stand out and sounds are excellent as well. So much fun to play and different shapes make it so interesting as it is challenging.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My son loves this. He is constantly creating new characters and enjoys this game immensely. I originally had it on my iPhone which I wanted back, so I downloaded it onto his Nabi2 with ease. He had to start the game over which was the only downside.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is soooooo blood omg first time I saw this app I knew I would love it but now that I have played it I realized I was so wrong because this is super duper  awesome fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Within seconds I was viewing one vid while downloading another. Easy to use and to find your down loads. Saves them onto your device and can be viewed while offline. I' m using a kindle fire, not HD. No need to pay for an app to download off YouTube. Happy viewing!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I have not played the first games in this series but i am having one of the best times playing this game.easy to pick up, hard to master, but an all out amazing experience.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|As a older person and trying to be current I appreciate anything that helps me achieve this. I appreciate the large size of the calculator and is SO EASY for me use. Works well on my kindle.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I absolutely hate all the junk advertising. All it does is take up space and its annoying! i AM ABOUT READY TO CANCEL FACEBOOK BECAUSE OF ALL THE ADS.
1452123071|5.0|Can't wait to surprise my husband with this book of postcards for him to post around his office. Jeffrey Brown rocks! You should check his books out too if you haven't.
0688014291|4.0|Although written around 1980, this 100 page book packs a wallop of solid, timeless advice on managing employees. The premise of the book is simply (although often forgotten) \\"happy employees produce great results.\\" While there are other aspects of good management, The One Minute Manager provides foundational direction on how to communicate goals, motivate positive action, and make adjustments in employee behavior when necessary. If every manager read this book, employee morale would skyrocket and the corporate world would be far better off.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I am joining the bandwagon with everyone else who is upset about only getting the 3D + the digital copy that I bet most buyers don't use and am NOT buying this at this time. Instead I am preordering the \\"Star Trek Into Darkness\\" combo where you get everything that you should get. I have to wait a little longer but that is OK. I think Disney should have a combo where you get it all and of course, is more money, but not having to paying almost double just because you want the 3D version. When I was a child back in the late 60's the local movie theater would charge $0.25 to get in for a regular movie, but $0.10 more if it was a Disney. Even back then Disney was charging more.
0553801473|3.0|I just got done reading A Dance with Dragons and I gotta say, it was wildly mediocre.  I loved the first three books.  Hell, I even thought the fourth one was great despite all the flack it received.  This book, though, was a bitch.  Slow moving story, unlovable characters, too many sideplots, etc.  There are very few redeeming qualities to this book.  But, if you're a fan of the series, like me, you're going to read it anyway.  Just don't expect a lot.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love having a calculator available on my kindle. Since I always have it with me,, I have used it many times.
B006WPWH4E|5.0|Use when I need to pass time, usually waiting for an appt or just relaxing after a days work.  I like the simplicity of this game, not too demanding, good for passing time.
B000A6T1KE|5.0|Gave me more insite on Tom Hardy & why Will Weaton's scene was cut out along with some other scenes
B008673ZAQ|5.0|At first I wasn't sure what Eva saw in Gideon, but I soon fell under his spell too. You will cheer them both on!
1451696205|5.0|So, I sound lame saying this, but I had never even heard of this book until the movie came out. I just knew I had to have the book, and was so glad to see that I could order it online. This was a great book and I'm glad to have bought it. The copy I bought from these sellers was in excellent conditions and I had no issues receiving it!
B000PKX2KA|5.0|After having a long discussion with an everything Apple techie friend about getting marine charts on an iPad (that we don't own), we decided to look at cheaper options for turning what we do have (laptops) into a chart plotter for our sail to Alaska this summer. At $35, this unit appeared to be the perfect solution for us budget-minded folk.<br /><br />The GPS software should be installed with the updated driver (found online and not on the CD provided) and connected to a proper USB port with 4800 baud rate(which should be the dedicated port once configured.) Then, the OpenCPN is configured to read GPS info from that correct COM port. After that, click follow me in OpenCPN and Voila! a little red boat icon appeared in the middle of our marina. Instant success!<br /><br />We were so impressed that our friends who own the neighboring boat asked us to set them up with the same system on their laptop. So we ordered them one that day and proceeded to install the CPN software, GRIB charts, and GPS receiver on their laptop. The second time took a bit longer to configure the GPS. After several failed attempts at having the GPS info be consistently received by OpenCPN, we discovered that the GPS puck needs to be configured to a COM port with a dedicated 4800 baud rate and that some ports default to 9600 baud rate even if you reconfigure it to 4800. Understanding that, we've labeled the correctly configured port for the GPS to eliminate any confusion in the future.<br /><br />Having witnessed two separate installations of this GPS receiver, I would conclude that the computer's hardware does play a role in the correct installation of this unit. Both computers did have Win7 64bit operating systems and honestly took very little time and effort to make work with the charting software. Still a week from our departure, we have yet to see our new \\"chart plotter\\" in action. But at a $35 investment who can pass up the opportunity to try this system on the water. Even our neighbors thought it was a worthy one!
0385474547|5.0|Word of the author's death reminded me that I have intended reading this book for some time but just didn't get to it.  It is a work of hope for the future of Africa.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This is a great album. I love their sound. I bought it because I liked the few songs on the radio but once I listened to the whole album it was on repeat!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I would definitely recommend watching this movie. It was really made to see how tragedy strikes in a blink of an eye. Also to live day by day and appreciate life and all the blessings.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is one of the best kindle games I have ever played I play it for hours but it needs  more updates
B00004Z4WR|5.0|been looking for this movie for a long time in the stores and they never have it till i came across it on amazon
B00915G6MG|5.0|I love the show and each character.  Each season keeps me intrigued.  I can't wait until season #10 comes out so that I can view each show again.  My favorite characters are Tony and Ziva.  Good, clean viewing!
B000XSWVEC|3.0|i ordered this one as a special edition but instead got the Normal Widescreen version was disappointed , didnt return it cuz it was cost me more to send it back then what the movie was worth
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Very entertaining legal drama.  They have developed the main characters extremely well.  Not extremely predictable which I like.  Good Show.
B008220C38|5.0|I LOVE Keira Knightly and Jude Law! Fantastic love story, epic and the cinematographywas so amazing, a little unusual but very cool.
B004LWZW7O|3.0|I liked the beginning and the story which kinda reminded me of Logan's Run.  (Spoiler Alert) But I lost interest after Matt Bomer died. In my opinion they should've flipped the leads and had Matt Bomer and Olivia Wilde play  the leads. They're both breathtakingly beautiful.
0790734850|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies in years.  Good story, great actors, true to the time period.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes this era..
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I sat down on the toilet two days ago when I first got this game.  I blinked and now my legs are asleep and I can't move.  I never knew addiction could be this ugly.  They need to put a button on the app to call for help without having to stop playing the game.
1936891026|3.0|This book doesn't really have much in tips for writing but more against procrastination otherwise called &#34;Resistance&#34; in this book. I could literally put the message of the story in this review and you won't miss anything. Here it goes.<br /><br />Procrastination is an enemy that must be fought. On sunny or rainy days if you want to be a pro you must practice. It is just like the saying 'Amateurs practice til they get it right. Pros practice til they can't get it wrong'. If you listen to the mantra and write everyday then you will succeed.<br /><br />There it is. The entirety of the book in one short paragraph. Hope it saves you the ten bucks on this book.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|I went into this movie with some trepidation but I was happily surprised that it turned out somewhat decent. Its not like the book but as a stand alone film its worth the watch. I did feel that the ending was a little bit rushed especially with how long the movie is, it could of been better. I would watch again.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Enjoyed this book, the charters are well defined. The story line is believable. It's an emotional read, which I love. Love all things harlequin!!
B00061QK02|5.0|Halarious movie...can't wait till the next one comes out later this year! One of the funniest movies in the past 10 years.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|fun fun I liked it but hard to use so I got rid of because it took up to much space on my kindle
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The narrator is awesome!  I listen in the car or while I'm cooking or cleaning house and many, many times with my earphones. It's fun and super convenient.
B0053CE2M2|5.0|So, this is one of my favorite metal albums of the last decade. It's simply incredible, but it took a little while for me to warm up to it, but then it grew on me very quickly. Anyway, the music is amazing, give it a try. About the vinyl edition, it's spectacular. I've had this on CD for a few months before I got it on vinyl, and the vinyl brought an entirely new listening experience to my ears. It's spectacular. If you still can, get the 2 LP Back On Black release. They're blue records. The gatefold is simply beautiful. I love the artwork. If you don't have a turntable, what are you waiting for? Buy one!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a awesome game. It is expensive, but worth the money. You can build almost anything! I like survival,but there is creative too I am a big fan of minecraft even though I don't have it ONLINE, :,( awesome graphics and cool blocks, if you know of &quot;him&quot; otherwise known as herbrine,who basically kills you and makes traps,and man made things,who looks like Steve,the guy you use,but no pupils, I have not seen,so do not worry, well that is how I rate this all-TIME I AM OUT PEOPLE!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I am so happy that after reading thousands and thousands of pages, I was rewarded with the satisfying ending of the longest epic fantasy series ever. Brandon Sanderson was finally able to finish the series that Jordan had spun out and never completed. Well done!  Sanderson writes in Jordan's voice -- an impressive skill even beyond Sanderson's excellent writing talent as evidenced in his other epic fantasy series. Not only full of action, but also interesting philosophical reflection on the nature of good and evil.
B00BLF9FOK|1.0|Just got this from Red Box for free, and man what a waste of time.  I love Ah-nold all the way but neither he nor ANY of the cast members took this South Korean-directed POS seriously.  The story is non-existent, but worse, none of the action sequences is even interesting.  The opening sequence, with the state trooper, is just sooooooo bad, truly the worst of any this movie lover has seen.  Finally, why would this big cartel boss, who plans every little detail about his escape stateside, have not planned anything at all for his Mexican side?  Really terrible movie that should be rated -10 out of 10 stars.  Lionsgate should pay me for wasting my time!
1623420148|5.0|I loved this book!!! Tangled pulls in you and drags you under, then you come up laughing out loud!! This is a well written love story told from a manwhore's pov!  I loved every bit of it from Drew Ryan to Kathrine Brooks, both characters keep in guessing and Mackenzie,Drew's niece just pulls the rug out from under you! I was rooting for this couple from the beginning and it only took me two days to read!  Once I got started I couldn't put it down.  Playboy meets business savvy one man woman, can we say a train wreck waiting to happen!  This book is and excellent read with hot and steamy scences although it doesn't consume the whole story but is appropriately placed in just the right places!  Please read this book you won't be disappointed at all!  Great Jop Writing Emma Chase!
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Maxwell/King series is fun; good beach read and anything by David Balducci promises to deliver.  You will be hooked in the first few pages.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Wish it had more substance.  Seems very basic. I use the Internet site instead of this basic app. Hopefully it gets improved in the future.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Can't wait until it's made into a movie.  Will be ordering more of this author's book...really enjoy his writing style.
B00005N6KG|4.0|This design is best for joggers and exercisers because they stay put in your ear. Also, they don't form a seal in your ear canal like some do, which makes your jogging steps sound like kick drums. This Sony model sounds better than most of this design. The problem with all of these ultra lightweight headphones is the cabling. The two conductors to each ear are not separately sheathed, they are both inside of one sheath. To prevent shorting, one conductor is coated. Flexing the cable causes abrasion of the coating and the coating wears out pretty quickly, thus causing intermittent shorts heard as scratching and cutting out. Too bad, 99% of the headphone is still perfectly good, it's just the inferior design of the cabling that causes this type of headphone to go bad. It's as if the industry as a whole planned it this way.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Moving, touching, inspiring, and a kick in the ass!  If you need to be reminded to get out and live your life with gusto and with appreciation, read this book!
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I needed to get better volume out of my wired earphones that I use with TV and Radio.  Volume controllers were not working well.  This E06 did it, boosting the sound well.<br />I am ordering a second one because it does need to be charged every so often.
0061537969|3.0|I like the premise of this book and it had some humor, originality, and warmth--- but it was schmaltzy, trite, and most of all sad. There were too many incidents of dog neglect. It starts with Denny getting home from work too late to let his old dog out to relieve himself. That's neglect. Then there's the scene where Eve leaves poor Enzo home alone with no food or water for three days. No excuse for that abuse! And, because the poor dog destroys the kid's toys since he's been abandoned for three whole days, he gets beaten! Then there's the scene where the poor dog is left in the car at the hospital parking lot and barely makes it out to pee when they finally come back. WTF??? And this is an allegedly well-loved dog! It made me sad for the dogs in the world who are not especially well loved. Imagine the abuse and neglect!
B00BF11STU|5.0|I am sure everyone has heard the reviews and seen the awards show.  Great film, acting, story.  I loved every moment and would recommend the film highly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|there is only one word to describe this app:wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow! But seriously awesome. get this app. you will not regret it.
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|If you want to watch a movie that is absolutely gorgeous, this is the one to see.  Not a great drama, but incredible costumes and an interesting presentation
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Very pleased with length of cord.  I can read and charge now.  Would recommend this charger and adapter to anyone.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great I love this game. It's like totally awesome.you should totally get this game. You won't regret it. Have fun.
B009R659L8|5.0|As in all of MHC novels she keeps the pace fast and the story interesting. Worth every penny, and as always I can't wait for the next book.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|im getting this cool app for my kindle fire i always played it on my friends i pad, didnt know it was on amazon app store... thanx this is one of my favorite apps EVER!! I highly reccomend it to anyone  bored of their regular apps.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|I love all the toy story movies and so does my daughter and my husband and everyone else I know. The movies are awesome.  Toy story, toy story 2, and toy story 3. Who hasn't thought that their toys come alive when you. Leave the room. I highly recommend all the toy story movies to everyone.
1444737112|5.0|I story about a cat with personality plus.  I can relate to his moods and attitude from my own cats.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I love all the toy story movies and so does my daughter and my husband and everyone else I know. The movies are awesome.  Toy story, toy story 2, and toy story 3. Who hasn't thought that their toys come alive when you. Leave the room. I highly recommend all the toy story movies to everyone.
1432794426|5.0|I'm only just under half way through this book but I can't put it down. I have read alot about Michael but this book is the best thing I have ever read.It's incredibly insightful and beautifully written. It shows the amazing man that he was behind all the fame and media. He was a very humble pure man that everyone has so very wrong. Everyone should read this. Congratulations to Karen for this fantastic tribute to a beautiful man that left too soon. RIP Michael x
B009AMANBA|4.0|Finally we have a realistic portrayal of Lincoln as the politician not an icon. It shows the leadership our present President lacks.
0679805273|5.0|One granddaughter got this as a gift when she graduated from Berkley.  I then ordered it as an adjunct gift for the one graduating from high school.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|i use facebook to keep in touch with my children and see pictures on my grand son.  it is important for me.
B0053O89WY|5.0|this is one of the best comedy shows on TV.. we enjoy  them and now we can take them with  us on trips
B009X011UQ|5.0|i love the color, it fits the kindle perfectly and it will protect the kindle from scratches and if it falls
0525478817|5.0|I loved this book. Great, quick read. Surprisingly addictive. Not crazy about the ending, but overall, fantastic! I could really relate to the characters. I think anyone affected by someone with cancer can.
B002LC2DQ4|4.0|Unfortunately, I didn't think to check with the manufacturer of my camera {Olympus} before purchasing this card. My camera [camedia c-740] can only use a 512mb size card. So, I'm returning this for a much smaller card.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Loved the game but was a little disappointing to find that as soon as I got into the game that I had to pay to go further.  Great game though.
B002RFX9R2|5.0|If you're a Creedence fan you'll love this: all the American singles with original mono mixes and artwork; the booklet is excellent and the box  is very beautiful. A great birthday/Father's day/Christmas present...
1589795474|5.0|Ordinary people can do extraordinary things.  As we say here in Texas;  A big hat doesn't mean you have cattle!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Well done to<br />The people it is good fun I never leave it at all all so do it proud
0765325950|2.0|No Spoilers, thus this review will be a little vague.<br /><br />Character development did not exist.  Way-Way too much fighting in some arena's, way too little fighting on other fronts.  Perrin in dreamland could have been done 100% better.  Rand's character might as well have been a talking stiff, huge disappointment for me.  Newly introduced characters added zero to the plot and zero to my interest.  Strong and powerful women in previous books were a side show, `er wait they were just on the side, not part of the show.  There were a couple saving grace stories keeping this from a one star, one involved Matt another Lan.  This book made me wish there was an \\"alternate ending\\" for the WoT series.<br /><br />Maybe Brandon rushed Memory of Light to work on his own stuff, maybe TOR wanted this series over with to end various WoT obligations, maybe Mrs. Jordan wanted her money sooner rather than later. Those are speculations of course, however this book is NOT a failure in writing alone, it took more than the author to create this mess.
B009NY43NY|3.0|That Ms Harris is hanging Sookie up; this definitely feels like a gift to fans who like to know how stuff ends.<br /><br />S'okay- I  read it twice. :)
B008BU75IQ|4.0|This eagerly awaited sequel does not disappoint readers seeking to know the story of the characters.  Embedded in the novel are many interesting facts about Great Britain and its rulers.  This is a quick read as the many events call the reader into fascination with what will happen next.  Archer leaves one once again with a Cliff hanger assuring us of another foray.
B0007939NO|5.0|A classic from a different era--my father loved it. He's since gone but it and the love of classic films lives on in his granddaughter, who grew up watching &#34;Brigadoon&#34; on VHS. It's a film that the whole family can watch. The singing/dancing scenes and Scottish bagpipes in the story are unique and enjoyable. In contrast to the hectic lifestyle of New York City, the &#34;Scottish countryside&#34; (a backdrop, sadly) seems idealic although, as the movie portrays,there are different types of problems! However, Gene Kelley and Cyd Charisse were marvelous, as were the other actors. When my daughter married, I bought her this dvd to replace the VHS tape that I wouldn't let her have! A first-rate movie, in my opinion.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|outstanding<br /><br />very tiny<br /><br />works great and gotta get stuff that make the mac book air even better, buy htis is you<br />have a need to use the old power cabal
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game. I hope they make the next one longer. I probably won't pay 2bucks again unless it's longer. I hope my current buy will help enable Fireproof to make us more content
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I had been wanting to read this book, and I'm really glad I did. The story is very touching without leaving you heavy hearted. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that sometimes the character of Victoria can get a little repetitive and predictable. Otherwise the storyline is very intriguing and enjoyable.
B000PAAH3K|4.0|Good book.  I would recommend this book.  Did not really have an ah-ha moment in the book but it did reinforced ideals already known.
B0001I561E|1.0|I purchased this DVD as a gift and sadly regret wasting my money the disk was acting up as soon as  I put  it in  the player , after trying to get it to play, took it out because it wouldn't work, only to reveal hundreds of tiny scratches, I'm positive it was used, which would have been understandable if it hadn't said new, when I bought it. I'm just extremely disappointed and aggravated
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book made me laugh so hard it was such a great story about Drew and his quest for love. This book reminds me so much of Wallbanger which caused me to have tears run down my face. This book is hilarious and a must read. Please purchase it is worth it!
B000FBJFSC|4.0|Well done story of his young life..amazing how much detail he recalls..his prose styleis just a little daunting in the beginning of the story but after a few chapters, I settled in and was able to get into his story more..
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I had seen the movie before and knew I had to own it.  It is just an amazing film!  I wish there were many more like it!  Fine documentary!
B003YDUUHS|5.0|I love the product,but the seller is false advertising it as an all region product.It is not.It is only PAL.<br />Te only way I can play it is through my PC.This sucks.I'd like to beable to play it on my home dvd player/playstation 3.<br />The only reason why I'm not returning it is because it was cheap and I'm a huge robbie williams fan.So I can bare with it.<br />The really needs to change it to a PAL only product.
B008K9SG9K|1.0|Poor Production Values...Don't expect Quadrophenia or Steely Dan's Pretzel Logic with this thing! These tunes could have been written for a Credit Card Commercial. As far as the singing goes, too many ingredients thrown into this stew, (but they don't know how to cook), make it very throw-away/trashy. As far as writing lyrics...These guys will never be confused with someone like PHIL OCHS.<br /><br />No Orginality...Sounds like Mumford & Sons feelby attempting to emulate Dexy's Midnight Runners and other credible 80's Bands. Almost as bad as Celtic Thunder, including the silly drum effects, along with a little Paula Cole singing \\"Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?\\"<br /><br />And...There is No Texture to this production; sounds compressed and you will be overwhelmed by the very Muddy Sound Quality, which extends throughout the entire album. Very inorganic sounding.  Again, this is OK for a Credit Card Commercial, but don't waste your time or money on this as musical entertainment because it will leave you feeling very empty.
B003U0AHCI|5.0|I love this product but, IT IS NOT ALL REGION!!!<br />IT\\"S ONLY PAL!!!<br />You can only play this on your PC if you don't have an all region or PAL dvd player.<br />Amazon needs to make the change it to PAL.Right now it's false advertising...
B003B02OQ4|5.0|This is without question my favorite of Grisham's books. If you're going to read Grisham, start with this book. I was hooked immediately and the characters are amazingly dynamic. Read this book.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This app is so fun I love it, I do wish that there were more customers though. Anyways, if your wondering if you should get it or not, you should it's awesome.!!(:
B001LMAK88|5.0|Wonderful cast, lots of fun!  A blast from the past and a tribute to the western genre.  I highly recommend it!
193700788X|2.0|*SPOILERS*<br /><br />So I finished Dead Ever After yesterday afternoon. I needed some time to mull over how I felt about it. To discern, if what few things that I have read spoiler wise had colored my opinion of the final act in the Sookieverse. I don't think it did. In all honesty it felt like a rushed slap dab attempt at ending the series.<br /><br />I call this review Mortal Kombat because to me CH seem to be the great voice in the sky yelling \\"FINISH HER!!\\" She was looking for a total knock out.<br /><br />A few disappointments:<br /><br />CH writing off Eric as nothing but \\"pragmatic\\". If I had to read that word one more time I would have thrown my Kindle. Honestly. I don't know what her definition is...but I don't think it's what she thinks it is.<br /><br />She made Eric...The same big bad viking warrior who loved battle like no other out to be a total pussy, roped in by legalities. What? WHAT? He's over a 1,000 years old and he was brought down by forms and fear of what...true death?  Retribution on Sookie? Have they not faced it all before?<br /><br />The fact that Eric would suggest that Sookie be a kept woman in a place that she would constantly fear for her life.<br /><br />SOOKIE REASCENDING ERIC'S INVITATION! ALL THE WHILE HER RAPIST BILL TROMPS IN AND OUT OF HER HOUSE>>>EVEN KISSING HER ON THE LIPS. SOOKIE EVEN THINKING OF HAVING REVENGE SEX WITH BILL THE RAPIST TO GET BACK AT ERIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sorry that required caps locks.<br /><br />The fact that Sookie was very MEH about losing Eric. She said she wasn't even heart broken. Seriously?<br /><br />The conversation with Eric. Eric loved the life inside Sookie. The spark. The fact that she loved the sun and smelled like it. Now all of a sudden he would \\"turn her without her consent.\\" is positively nuts. Yes they had discussed it. Why would he be patient enough to stand by while she and Bill had a relationship when at anytime he could have her and turn her. It was her choice...and that's what hewanted. Her to choose to be with him.<br /><br />The fact that he wanted \\"a collection of blonde dolls\\". REALLY!? Now he's some creepy guy who has a type. I can't recall, but this other older child...was she mentioned in other books? Or did CH come up with her just to add effect? Is he Ted Bundy now too? Is it supposed to make us feel better? Geez.<br /><br />Berry the Bellboy was not even relevant. He read his e-reader...that much we know. He was out of the line of sight almost totally after he was reintroduced. Why?<br /><br />Amelia being a big mouth bumbling idiot. Her saying something in passing about the cluviel dor is what made a man sell his soul? He didn't even believe his own kid was a witch, but he is willing to some how find a devil and sell his soul to get it? Man there was a ton of reaching in this book.<br /><br />All of Sookie's enemies getting put down in packs. See?...rushed. 5 birds 2 stones. She should have started putting them down more gradually through the last few books. That was a bunch to try to wrap up.<br /><br />Naill leaving a portal open. What? Why?<br /><br />DAMN ALL THE iPODS! Most awkward sex scene ever...and man, there were some super awkward ones in 50 Shades of Gray. \\"Your boobs are better than I remembered...wow.\\" Really Sam? Is it the first time you've seen boobs?<br /><br />Humping like bunnies....then telling him to \\"take it slow\\". I thought you weren't heart broken Sookie? Looks like your lady bits are working....why slow down now? eh?<br /><br />LINE DANCING!!! No CH....just NO.<br /><br />CH most assuredly \\"FINISHED HER!\\" with this one. Sookie was just not Sookie. CH molded Eric into something new, lack luster and weak. It was a sad and hollow ending to so much hard work on a pretty neat world. I'll be reading the CODA just because I'm nosy like that. But only if I can get it free. But the previous enthusiasm won't be there.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Excellent free app for my kindle.  Very intuitive and easy to play.  Only downside is pop advertising that starts after each deal but only a minor distraction and something of<br />interest could come up.<br /><br />I highly recommend trying it.  Four and one half out of five stars.

0684803356|5.0|Controversy has swirled around Ernest Hemingway's masterpiece since the day it was published. \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in 1941 and the Pulitzer committee agreed unanimously to name the book as the winner of the fiction category. Board president Nicholas Murray Butler, however, overruled the committee on the grounds that he felt the book to be profane and offensive. No award in the fiction category was given that year. The Pulitzer committee, sans Butler, did go on to award Hemingway in 1953 for \\"The Old Man and the Sea.\\" Butler has since been widely criticized for his partisan politics and racial beliefs during his 43 year stint as president of Columbia University. Hemingway also won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954.<br /><br />\\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is Ernest Hemingway's seminal novel of the Spanish Civil War. Beginning in 1937 Hemingway traveled to Spain to cover the war as a reporter. In the years before WWII, Spanish Republicans, backing the established Spanish Republic fought the fascist Nationalist forces of General Francisco Franco. The Republicans received backing from the Soviet Union and various organizations of the Marxist movement, among others. The rising forces of Nazi Germany and Italy backed Franco. The fascists under Franco won. Franco established a dictatorship and then went on to rule Spain with an iron hand until his death in 1975.<br /><br />It is easy to get hung up on all the politics involved in this book - who is backing which side, etc. Remember the time frame of the book (pre-WWII) and know that the story is essentially human. It is about ideals, loyalty, love, sacrifice, and honor in the face of loss and death. Robert Jordan is an American who joins the guerrillas fighting on the side of the republic as a dynamiter. Jordan's goal is to blow a key bridge right after a Republican attack starts against the Fascists. He meets up with the anti-Fascist cell in the area, which is headquartered in a well-hidden cave. Pilar is the wife of Pablo, who ostensibly is in charge, but Pilar runs the show. Pablo is tired, burned out, and dangerous to the cause after years of war and atrocities committed on both sides, and Pilar takes the reins. While coordinating the attack with the cell Robert Jordan meets and falls in love with Maria, a young woman adopted by the cell after her family is decimated by the fascists and she is raped by their soldiers. Much like the principal characters in \\"A Farewell to Arms,\\" the wartime romance is accelerated and Jordan undergoes a transformation due to his love for Maria. He begins to question his role in an increasingly futile conflict. He spiritually takes Maria for his wife with hopes and dreams for the future. When it becomes evident that the guerrilla attack will be doomed, Jordan must decide between escaping with Maria or staying true to his ideals and do his duty with honor in the face of impending disaster. The entire story takes place in four days.<br /><br />I really liked \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\\" It gets beyond the politics and the ideologies and more into the nature of war, showing that there is good and bad on both sides of any conflict. Hemingway points out that the best soldiers don't necessarily win a war - the ones with the biggest weapons do. \\"To make war all you need is intelligence. But to win you need talent and material.\\" Other memorable gems from the text include, \\"Nothing is done to oneself that one does not accept,\\" and \\"If you stop complaining and asking for what you never will get, you will have a good life. A good life is not measured by any biblical span.\\" The apt title itself comes from the John Donne quote, \\"...And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.\\" Thus is the nature of any conflict, regardless of the politics involved.  One reason Jordan, an American, is fighting in Spain is because he is concerned with the rise of bigotry and fascism in his own country. This belief is made all the more ironic by the treatment of the book by the Pulitzer committee and Nicholas Murray Butler in 1941, on the very eve of America's entry into WWII against Nazi Germany.<br /><br />Do not be intimidated by \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\\" On the surface it reads like a great adventure story with compelling characters. It is so much more than that, however. As with the very best of novels, its themes and messages are truly timeless, ringing true during the Spanish Civil War, WWII, Vietnam, and today. This is an excellent book, and I recommend it very highly.ief is made all the more ironic by the treatment of the book by the Pulitzer committee and Nicholas Murray Butler in 1941, on the very eve of America's entry into WWII against Nazi Germany.<br /><br />Do not be intimidated by \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\\" On the surface it reads like a great adventure story with compelling characters.

B001BZRUR4|1.0|If you are a parent and you find your child reading this book, find out if an adult has given it to them or recommended it to them to read and report that adult to the police. I work in law enforcement, and this book seems written specifically as a handy tool for child predators to manipulate and prey on teenagers and young boys and girls who feel isolated and alienated from their peers. It teaches children that it isn't creepy or weird for an adult to stalk them, hang around their house at night or after their track practices, or buy them ice cream or \\"special\\" gifts that have significance to only the two of them.  This book is extremely disturbing and creepy.<br /><br />Rarely has there been a narrator so self-absorbed and so lacking in self-awareness. He treats everyone with absolute disdain, even after he has supposedly learned how precious people are. He is smugly and casually insulting to waiters, friends, librarians, parents, in short, everyone who isn't in the special group singled out for his special saving favors, exposing them to his sense of smug superiority, even while professing how humble, ugly, out of shape, and what a poor lover he is.<br /><br />In the words of Holden Caulfield, he is a phony. He is a classic narcissist, so utterly self-centered that he has the amazing ability to completely disregard the thoughts and feelings of other characters because HE knows what is best for them, despite what they say. HE knows what children need better than their parents do. HE knows what women need better than they do. Like every abusive stalker I've ever dealt with, HE knows that when the girl says she isn't interested in him, she doesn't really mean it because he can \\"tell\\" that she really loves him or that she is just trying to prevent herself from feeling love just to prevent herself from getting hurt. He disingenuously professes his faults just so the reader can praise him for his humility and bravery. He casually rationalizes any type of despicable behavior he wants to engage in just because he thinks the rules don't apply to him or that he has some special insight into situations that enable him and only him to know the right thing to do. It's OK to beat up a child, steal, commit kidnapping, trespassing, and stalking because you are special, because you are wrapped in a special enveloping purpose that makes it OK to step outside of society's rules.<br /><br />On top of it all, this writing is atrocious. \\"My heart is pouring out of me through my eyes\\" and all that kind of horrible purple prose you'd expect from Taylor Swift's diary. Many of the \\"heartwarming\\" scenes seem lifted directly from Hallmark Channel made-for-tv movies or the kind of glurge emails you get where \\"tears are streaming\\" down everyone's faces. The author uses a technique of short choppy sentences.<br /><br />And he uses it repeatedly.<br /><br />It is extremely annoying.<br /><br />And he does it throughout the book.<br /><br />Ad nauseum.<br /><br />I remember thinking \\"The Book Thief\\" was pretty decent, but this book makes me think the author has absolutely zero grasp of human emotions, thoughts, or reactions, least of all his own.

B003V924II|5.0|This film is about last days of the Roman Empire and it is set in Alexandria, Egypt.  I picked it for several reasons:  Agora in Alexandria was one of the first public libraries where young, noble men had their lessons thought to them and where they freely exchanged their ideas.  It was a breeding ground for raising new leaders for the future generations.  But this is also a story about Hypatia, one of the first female philosophers from the ancient times known to mankind.  Although none of her written work remains today, she was well known figure and her unfortunate demise is just one of the facts that grants her immortality.<br /><br />Hypatia devoted her entire life to teaching, writing and questioning the world around her.  As a philosopher, she raised questions related to mankind as well as God and Universe.  During her life, religion was depply divided between pagans, who worshiped Egyptian Gods, Jews who believed in a single God and Christinas fairly new religion who accepted teachings of Jesus and were waiting for their salvation.  There was little tolerance between these three fractions and with Roman Empire loosing its grip in that part of the world, it was a place destined for uprising between old world and the new one; between aristocracy and their slaves.<br /><br />I liked the fact that director choose to portray Hypatia as a woman devoted to her profession and able to separate herself from men she was teaching, in spite of the fact that many of them fell in love with her for her brilliant mind and her compassionate spirit.  Her beauty from the inside out, transcends the social order of the time which is both her strenght and her fall.  Being unmarried woman, she has no protector.  Her profession requires of her to constantly question and challenge the world around her which does not sit  well with men in power.  Her brutal death makes her a martyr that makes her immortal for eternity.<br /><br />Great movie, with story well told.  Director did not attempt to appease any of the religious groups which some audiences may find difficult to accept.  I loved the costumes and depictions of the ancient city, the realistic display of disparity between poor and rich.  Film definitely worth seeing.mpt to appease any of the religious groups which some audiences may find difficult to accept.

B009LMTDL0|3.0|Women sabotage other women and this is not addressed in the book. What I have seen and experienced is that women in leadership are the glass ceiling to other women instead of being mentors helping them to rise. They hold women to extreme standards of perfectionism and promote men instead. When  a man fails to meet those standards the comment is made \\"well, they are a man.\\" Women need to hold men to the same standards they hold other women or lower the standards they hold women to the same as the men. You cannot break through the ceiling when you have women Queen Bees above you.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|Star Trek (2009). Rated &#34;PG-13&#34;. Running Time: 2 hours, 06 mins.<br />This is the 11th movie in the film series.<br />The new movie, Star Trek (2009), was an event that I had to invite my family to see. I have been a fan of &#34;Star Trek&#34; since the original 1966-69 tv series was in syndication in the 1970's.<br />  The movie begins with Captain Robau (Faran Tahir) in a dire emergency situation aboard the USS Kelvin. So that he does not endanger his crew he asks George Kirk (Chris Hemsworth) to take command. As Captain Robau travels into Nero's Romulan spaceship, he is conquered and killed by Nero (Eric Bana). As George Kirk is in command on the bridge, he makes sure everyone is evacuated, including his wife, Winona (Jennifer Morrison), who is giving birth as he speaks to her by communication. He chooses not to leave the bridge and stays in command in the captain's chair. He asks his wife details and knows he had a son and names him, James Tiberius Kirk, before he is thrown into the air and the USS Kelvin explodes.<br />  The evil Nero and his crew have been sent through a black hole in a time alteration.<br />We are treated to a time when James T. Kirk (Chris Pine), Dr. McCoy, (Karl Urban), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin) are in Starfleet Academy training and about to begin their first mission with Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) aboard the Enterprise.<br /> I believe this story takes place 9 to 12 years after the story of the first STAR TREK pilot, The Cage.<br /> Dr. McCoy manages to sneak Kirk onboard the Enterprise, while Uhura talks Spock (Zachary Quinto) into letting her board the Enterprise.<br />  On this mission, it becomes a power of minds between Pike (Bruce Greenwood), Spock and Kirk. Captain Pike ends up getting captured by Nero and that puts Spock in command. Kirk and Spock have it out and literally have a physical fight. Kirk is ordered off the ship. Cadet Kirk ends up up on a snowy terrain and is chased by a creature ([[ASIN:B00AEFXNGE Cloverfield [Blu-ray]]]) and ultimately into a cave.  In this cave, he meets a man. The man recognizes him as &#34;Jim&#34;. It is the older &#34;Spock&#34; (Leonard Nimoy) who explains how he was caught up in time. He takes Kirk to a Starfleet Base where we meet the younger Montgomery Scott (Simon Pegg), whom Spock fondly called &#34;Scotty&#34;. Spock explains to them what they should do and how they must make things right again. If successful, everything will be the way it should be.<br /><br />Also in the cast: Ben Cross as &#34;Serek&#34;, Winona Ryder as &#34;Amanda&#34;, Clifton Collins Jr, Tyler Perry, Jason Brooks, Christopher Doohan, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Morrison, Amanda Foreman, Jonathan Dixon, Tony Guma, Deep Roy, Jason Matthew Smith, Akiva Goldsman, Charles Haugk, Max Chernov, Jesper Inglis, Gerald W. Abrams, James McGrath, Kasia Kowalczyk, Bryan Lee, Wesley Nguyen.<br /><br /> Chris Doohan is the son of the late James Doohan (&#34;Scotty&#34;). In this film, he appears with Simon Pegg as &#34;Scotty&#34; as his human assistant in the transporter room.<br /><br /> Majel Barrett was the voice of the computer for the last time. She passed away on December 18, 2008, just 2 weeks after recording her voice-over. She was the wife of Gene Roddenberry (creator of Star Trek) and she appeared in the very first Star Trek pilot episode, The Cage, as &#34;Number One&#34; and in the original 1966-69 tv series as &#34;Nurse Chapel&#34; and in Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987-94) as &#34;Lwaxana Troi&#34;.<br /><br />Option of Language and Subtitles: English, French, Spanish.<br /><br />Audio Commentary with J.J. Abrams, Bryan Burk, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof, Roberto Orci.<br /><br />Special Features: A New Vision featurette. Gag Reel.<br /><br />First of all, my thanks to J.J. Abrams, [[ASIN:B00005JNOG Lost - The Complete First Season]], for asking Leonard Nimoy to return as &#34;Spock&#34; in this film.  Some scenes with Leonard Nimoy brought back the spirit of &#34;Star Trek&#34; for me.<br /><br /> The time-travel alteration makes one Trekkie confused. The beginning romance between Spock and Uhura? Never happened in the original.<br /> &#34;Pavel Chekov&#34; did not make his first appearance in the original STAR TREK until Season 2.<br />  Spock's mother, &#34;Amanda&#34;, could not have possibly died as she (then played by Jane Wyatt) was with her son, &#34;Spock&#34;, in the original tv series episode &#34;Journey To Babel&#34; in 1967 and in the movie, [[ASIN:B000HZGNEU Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]] (1986).<br /><br /> Nichelle Nichols suggested playing Uhura's grandmother, but it could not be written in due to the Writer's Guild Strike at the time.<br /><br />Pause your DVD at 47 mins, 36 secs, in play time you can see a Star Wars R2D2 in the debris to the left of the screen just above Sulu's head.

B00A81NFAS|5.0|30 minutes into this film, I was wondering if I wanted to watch more.  The set up is long and drawn out with high decibel shouting at each other.<br />Then it transformed into a real love story that was very enjoyable watching it play out.  It was somewhat predictable, but that didn't bother me at all.  Jennifer Lawrence and the entire cast were superb.<br /><br />I am very glad I saw this movie through the set up and I recommend it to everyone who wants a good entertaining film.<br /><br />I loved the scene at the football game tail gate party.
B002CMXAYW|4.0|I enjoyed all the cameos, like Paul Schaeffer as the agent, and Billy Crystal as the mime (\\"Don't talk back! Mime is money!\\") and Fran Dreschler, and Fred Willard as the Air Force lieutenant (``Welcome Spinal Tarp``). And what was that on Rob Reiner`s cap-- USS Ooral? USS Doral? Maybe Roger Ebert's review in Great Movies II built it up too much.<br /><br />But I think the real reason I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would is that it just wasn't that much of a parody. What I mean is that when the actors were singing really stupid lyrics and behaving stupidly and saying stupid things, and when their fans were acting like dumbbells, I just didn't find it funny, because that's how I remember it was actually like back then. I remember in `66, listening to Eve of Destruction, at age 15, and being swept away by the lyrics, and then discovering Bob Dylan with Bringing it all Back Home and Highway 61.<br /><br />But most of my high school classmates were listening to \\"My Baby Does the Hanky Panky\\" (the only lyric). So my criticism is that the film Spinal Tap is not that funny because of the plot flaw that it is not possible to make the characters stupid enough to create a parody of them.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|What an unbelieveable story.  The special effects were incredible.  Naomi Watts is a fabulous actress and she made you feel as though you were right there with her.  Some of the scenes were very hard to watch.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good book, but it needs more  body  for the story.  R.  I think the  lacking  for more e<br /><br />Forget what some people rings were about
B00AFEXRME|3.0|Didn't watch the whole move.  It moved too slowly and didn't seem able to get the story going.  Too bad -- Denzel Washington is a great actor and the writers and directors should have made sure the movie was far better than it was.
B008BU75IQ|1.0|Written as for children,  with predictable scenes and cliched references.  The story concept is good,  and somewhat original.  Unfortunately the author ran out of gas before coming up with a plausible ending.  Having said that,  I did read it the whole way through.
B00BN3EE1O|3.0|Too long, should have been edited more.  The book was fabulous, but the move a bit too long.  Acting was great.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|Love it! My friend and I are now obsessed! We stay up late to try and get different combinations. It is very fun when you combine things and it works- it feels awesome! (And you get to feel smart!) :D I have recommends this to some friends already, and I recommend it to you!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow. What a book! Read it in one sitting, when I probably should have been sleeping. Best thriller I've read in years.
0061478784|5.0|I watched the movie first, like most people, I'm sure.<br />But just because you saw it doesn't mean you shouldn't read this!<br /><br />The humour in this book is first rate. The plotline is also a bit different along the way, and the characters are more in-depth. If you were in love with Howl from the movie, definitely check out this Howl. Sophie is also filled with sarcasm, per usual.<br /><br />In all: I completely recommend this book to pretty much everyone. There's more to it than the movie, trust me. READ IT!
B0053O89WY|5.0|I started watching this at season 2.  Four nerds working at Caltech and living in Pasadena, Ca.  I live in Los Angeles County, so it's been fun watching these guys and now three ladies.  It's a really funny show.  By far, my favorite episode is Einstein Approximation (season 3, episode 14).  Or other wise known as just Sheldon in the ball pit.  Bazanga.<br /><br />My favorite episode of season 5 is the Shiny Trinket Maneuver (12th episode).  Or better known as the episode where Sheldon gives Amy a tiara.  Heck, if that tiara had real diamonds, I'd have been just as excited as Amy was.  ;)<br /><br />If you think this is just for the young 20 something, you're wrong.  My 80 year old grandfather likes this show.  I am 36 years old.  My dad, aunts and uncles also like this show.  Every family function we have, one topic we all have in common to discuss is what's going on in the Big Bang Theory show.<br /><br />Season 5 has been pretty good.  I love Shamy (Sheldon and Amy combined).  Both actors are my favorite as well.  Sheldon is played by talented Jim Parsons.  He has won three various awards for his performance as Sheldon.  Amy is perfectly casted by Mayim Bialik.  She's better known for her role as Blossom in [[ASIN:B001GP5TMW Blossom: Seasons 1 & 2]].  I've been a fan of that show as well.  It's also awesome that Mayim has a Ph.D. in neuroscience.  Really.  She's also a UCLA alumni - a favorite college of mine and my family.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I found myself rooting for Katie throughout this great story.  As always, Nicholas Sparks nails it!  The twist at the end was very cool!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Each character had his/her moment and left you hanging when it switched to another character.  Some characters I loved and some I did not like.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|It never ceases to amaze me what unfathomable cruelty one person can inflict upon another.  This is the story back-- told in the words of a small child who, through the love and determination of his young mother, escapes their nightmare.  You really don't want to miss this one.

B0011UJMK2|3.0|Overall this was a good book, but the Russian story was just too depressing for me. One reviewer who gave this just a 1star rating claims it to be silly. This is based upon his history and actual residence in Russia for 20 years. Who can argue with that?<br /><br />The author's style of writing seemed simplistic at times, but it did give me NA good historical perspective about a period and place I knew little about.<br /><br />The author cites many books and other references he used for his book, but unfortunrtely none were availible in<br />Kindle.<br /><br />I am on the fence about whether I want to go back to fictional Russia with Smith's second book, Secret Speech.
B007FDE4Y8|1.0|i got his to use with my cannon t2i. at first, i thought to myself. this probably will require a bit of time and patience, and all the people complaining must be whiners who can't do the most simple things. wrong!..after 7 months i still can't balance it. i can get it as far with static balance(to be stable while not moving with it) but the dynamic balance(to be stable while you move it left-right/back-fort or walk with it) is completely another story. i've done at least several hundreds of tweaks, watched lots of videos online, read forums, etc but is a no go! the bubble level is useless, because even if is in the center this thing will not stay balanced.<br /><br />another thing is the bolt screws get loose on its own, the construction of the item is rather cheap and won't last long.<br /><br />please save yourself from hair-pulling frustration and don't waste your time/money with this like i did.<br />haha all the video praising this product must be fake.
B00CATSONE|5.0|What a creative & inventive individual!  He had dealings with Edison, Westinghouse and JP Morgan.  Interesting times.  I don't know that he was a mad scientist as he was known.  It seems though that the 3 aforemention men were focused on their own success and greed - at Tesla's expense.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun....my kids think it is great too.  Only negative is that the keyboard pops up when you start...need to figure out how to make it stop.
B00BF123WG|5.0|This movie is truly educational.  The beginning is a little hard to watch but once you get through it it is a very educational experience. Not something i would watch over and over but i think that everyone should see it once.
0062213423|5.0|granddaughter really wanted and enjoyed this book. she said shed was letting all her friends look and read it as long as the gave back. really enjoyed it.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|Such a cute movie! I wish that i bought it instead of just rented it!! Might scare some kids but its got more humor than anything
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It has so many functions. The more you play around with it the more amazing this app is. I am a writer and evernote keeps me organized better than any other app. It's a must have!
B005CRQ2IU|3.0|The graphic novel is a great read, with great art, read any other review to read about it.<br /><br />This Kindle version is not allowed on Kindle PC, so I tried to read it on my Kindle App since I don't have a hardware Kindle. The panels are so small, with no way to zoom, and I gave myself a headache peering. If anyone mumbles and the print is extra small, I cannot read it at all. That great art? Worthless on the Kindle app. Other reviews state that on the handhelds it's no better. This NEEDS to be made available for PC before it's worth it. I'm sorry I purchased it; I should have borrowed it from the library so I could actually SEE it.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|Demi Lovato's fourth album, \\"Demi\\", is her most consistent yet.  Her previous three albums all had strong stuff, but also had a fair amount of weak points. This is the first album where I don't have to skip any tracks.  The tracks are well-produced, well-written, and always show off Demi's talents as a vocalist.  And Demi's vocals are stronger than ever.<br /><br />\\"Demi\\" is a mix of upbeat songs and slow songs.  Most of the songs concern love & relationships. Sometimes it's playful; other times the lyrics are reflective. It is a pure pop album, with shades of R&B and rock.  She doesn't over-jump on the EDM bandwagon; only two songs have an electro-pop style. There are tracks that evoke Adele, Christina Aguilera, and Katy Perry.<br /><br />Beside \\"Heart Attack\\" (which almost all of you have heard by now), \\"Made In the USA\\", \\"Without The Love\\", \\"Two Pieces\\", \\"Nightingale\\", \\"In Case\\" \\"Really Don't Care\\", \\"Shouldn't Come Back\\", and \\"Warrior\\" are the strongest tracks.  \\"Made In The USA\\" and \\"Without The Love\\", like \\"Heart Attack\\", are catchy, playful songs.  \\"Nightingale\\", \\"Two Pieces\\", and \\"In Case\\" are beautifully written, heartfelt ballads.  \\"Really Don't Care\\" is peppy, upbeat song about living in the moment. \\"Shouldn't Come Back\\" and \\"Warrior\\" are the most personal songs.  They are both about staying strong in adverse situations.  Demi's emotions show in all the ballads and can be felt by the listener.<br /><br />\\"Demi\\" is one of the best pure pop albums of the second decade of the 21 century so far. --Isa R Bufano
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think this is the best game ever. There are no glitches, and I have a kindle fire, but you should dealt get this. It's really awesome.
B00821OX98|5.0|We are totally enthralled in this series!! It has twists and turns that keep you guessing, it is well written, and the acting is good.
B00A25NLOU|3.0|This book is about to feelings: love for the old, and admiration for the new.<br /><br />The &#34;love for the old&#34; part comes from the author love for books, which is contagiating. The &#34;admiration for the new&#34; comes from the author awe for all that comes from Google and san Francisco startups, which is less interesting, but doesn't really hurt the book.<br /><br />There is also a conspiracy, but the author approaches it with a light tone, that suits the book In a perfect manner.<br /><br />Aside from this, I think the story is good, surprising and well told. The characters are original and interesting. There is a love story, and it plays well.<br /><br />In essence, i'd certainly recommend it for anyone searching for a good, lighthearted, funny book.
0763644765|5.0|My son loves this book and looks at it often. I think it's a good starting point for introducing the potty.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm not a teenager, just the parent of one, and I was totally engrossed in every page. I read late into the night, or rather, early into the morning because I didn't want to stop reading. At the last page, I wanted more. Thank you once again Mr. Howdy, for another book, VERY well done.
B007ZUTNF6|5.0|I couldn't say enough about this book.  I wish everyone in the world could read it and begin to know the truth about our lives.  I wish that we didn't have to go to the schools that we are required by law to attend that teach us one untruth after another.  I wish even more that our religions could learn, understand, and preach THE TRUTH instead of what they do preach that does more harm than good to our society.  By reading &#34;The Holographic Universe&#34;, a person can at least be exposed to the way things really are and then decide using her own intellect what she wants to believe.  (And, of course, that is so for the his's and he's of the planet also.)
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I cant seem to figure out how to set the time.  Not the alarm but the time! There are no clear directions for this!!
B002NY731U|5.0|What more needs said? One of the finer bands in my lifetime and one of the better examples of their work. Not many appreciate the political and social lyrical leanings of Dave Mustane but I don't mind it. Surely it sounds better than the pop hysteria dominating the market today.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game! The graffics were good,as well as, the story line. Puzzles were challenging, but not to hard. Would like to see more games like this. Loved the underwater theme.
B007M45PMU|4.0|Saw these guys in Austin two weeks after I bought the album, def increases my fondness of the music. They have some crazy tracks in addition to their hit Hey Ho. Def worth a listen if you like folk type music. You will be glad you did.
1452115567|5.0|By now, Maddie the Coonhound is an icon of rescued dogs everywhere.  The reproductions are not art-book quality, but this is a great price.  The very best photo is one of Maddie with Theron on the road; she has an expression of pure canine bliss.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Moved quickly and was a very good read.  Looking forward to the sequel!  Though, I would consider the ending to be good.  I loved the characters and the little village that it took place in.  I would definitely recommend it.

B000068CNX|5.0|Friends is one of those shows anyone born before 1990 will love. If you watched it as a kid or even watching it for the first time as a 20 something you will laugh and cry for its humorous and understandable situations there is no wonder the show lasted 10 years
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|GREAT GAME! Fun to play and to kill time. Love the sound effects of bones snapping when you crash! Great job developer!!
B00BBA6FMU|5.0|A highly recommended story that will almost make you weep. Kathleen Grissom tells the tale of a young, Irish girl whose life takes an unexpected turn when she is orphaned on a boat to America then taken into slavery. It's in the slave kitchen house where she finds her place in a new family. There, the black occupants love and care for her as though she was their own. However, tragedy is around every corner in this story and life for the kitchen house slaves remains at the mercy of all those up at the &#34;Big House&#34;. The story is told from the perspective of two main characters - white Lavinia and black Belle - whose narratives had me as a reader hooked at every page.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is amazing! I have had it for like a year and every day I play it! I have built castles and houses and a cruise ship. I absolutely love it!!!!!!!

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I got this just to see how it was.  It is mindless fun (for me anyway), not really much skill involved.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just love this game, you get to go worldwide and its really addictive but I would be more fun if you could go every where and not just in a few country's
B00908DDZM|4.0|Had only heard one of the songs on this album before purchasing it...but now I have several favs that I dig.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Out of all the card games that I have played on my Kindle Fire HD, this is one of my favorites.  I appreciate that the developer has taken the time to make something with high production value and offer something several notches above the typical 'pay to win' TCG experience.  Winning isn't purely based on having the best cards...although that is a large part of it....and card placement and keen deck building can win the day.  I also appreciate that there is a means to 'grind' for new cards if you don't want to pay.  The AI is fairly merciless outside of the tutorial, so you may encounter the money wall fairly early on, which may compel you to drop some cash.  However if you are patient enough, you can still have a decent time for free.  Does it have the depth of a mature tcg like Magic the Gathering?  Definitely not, but it is a solid game and can only improve.
B00BR0SEAK|5.0|The more I listen to this disc the  more I like it. Great line up!  Ian Gillian on  vocal,  Ian Paice on  drums,  Roger Glover on bass, Steve Morse on  guitar and Don Airey filling the  big space  left by the late great John Lord.  Airey has some  big shoes to fill and I think he does it well. Superbly recorded, if you are a long time  fan, I think you  can't help enjoy and get into this latest collection of rockers' tunes whose famed Machine Head album is officially  the  first  &#34; Heavy Metal Album&#34;  prove  they still got it and will to the end.
B002OHK7CS|3.0|The stories are really over done.  People who give it 5 stars a closet soap opera fans.  I want to like it, and do at times, but man, the over the top BS, is a bit much.  I guess that is what it takes to get ratings.
B00006AW2M|5.0|It's the Stones  in the psychedelic hey day. I had to get it. I couldn't  remember any of the  music.  It's true what they say, &#34; If you can remember the 60s , you weren't there'&#34;. Oh yeah,  Flower Power !
B00C061I3K|5.0|Daft Punk understands the concept of a good groove, and they do everything with excellence. Attention to detail is fantastic, regardless of what genre they're doing. Get Lucky proves that real music can still be a #1 hit. This album as a whole is excellent, and I've listened to it several times concurrently.
B0057EYACI|5.0|Jim's work will forever live in my heart. Talk about a national treasure taken from us way too soon! Jim's 3 albums were all released during my High School years, and Jim's hits were always spinning on the radio. AM was still king, and they always sounded great on the car radio or 8-track players. What casual fans, or those that didn't invest in the albums didn't realize was that Jim's enormous talent was only skimmed on the radio. SO many deep tracks that are essential are here, as well as bonus material. For a few dollars, this is the best volume to score. The EDSEL set reviewed here delivers slightly improved sound than the 50 Anniversary sets that are OOP. The 50 Anniv. sets seem slightly bright, though excellent sound, also. This EDSEL sound is a little warmer to my ears, and the booklet is chock full with lyrics, notes, and photos.<br /><br />Listen to my generation's premier singer-songwriter, and experience his gifts to all of us...<br /><br />All the best,<br />GT
B0054JZC6E|4.0|nice game!Watch out though.in game purchases are in the game , so be careful! still, it is a fun game and a good time passer
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite shows.  What I love is the fact that each season is a new story line.  That way, if the show ever gets cancelled, it's finished....no cliffhanger ending!  I hate it when shows just get cancelled with no resolution for the characters.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|What a fantastic group of actors and everything about this DVD was a KEEPER! Thanks to ALL involved in this! I'm a very satisfied customer!
B00BEIVXKI|5.0|This remaster does accentuate the recording nuances which make this release so unique.  Highly recommended.  Sadly, does not come with liner notes that might help the fan to further appreciate this work!  Still definitely worth buying.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Charlaine Harris dialed it in on this one. I only finished this one because I at least wanted to finish the series. I am truly disappointed at how Sookie and Sam get together. Why bother at this point!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Continues to build characters of past books. Gives all someone to love or hate. I would recommend all the books in this series for the stay at home adventurer.
0374203032|4.0|I got it super fast and it was in pretty decent shape. It was a great book to read for my class.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is probably my favorite game. I liked the first one a lot, but when I started playing this one, I couldn't stop! There are more obstacles, and I love the zip line and the caves. It's harder than the first one, but not way too hard that you give up on the first try. I absolutely LOVE this game and I highly recommend it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a fun game, but potentially expensive. You can easily be sucked in and find yourself spend a lot of cash.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Every time I thought I had it figured out I didn't. Great thriller. I don't know anyone who hasn't read it by now so if you haven't, you must!

B009YP9L7U|4.0|I have to say I picked this one up mostly due to the low price. I read it in a day or two and enjoyed it ...until I saw it was a Harlequin Romance book then I felt like an old married lady .<br /><br />:)

B00CDT41RY|3.0|I really don't know what all the hype was about. The modern music was distracting. Samuel Jackson's character was the most interesting. I'm glad I waited for the DVD.
B001I10ABE|5.0|OK, maybe \\"EVER\\" is a bit of a hyperbole, but personally, in comparison to all the different media that I've listened to this album on since the time this album was released, this vinyl re-issue is easily the best sounding that I've experienced. I've listened to this album on cassette tape, CD and various formats of compressed and uncompressed digital, but nothing has sounded as full and engaging as this vinyl.<br /><br />The sound quality is truly amazing, in fact, it's so good, you'd probably enjoy it even on a simple $60 turntable. A friend of mine who owns an [[ASIN:B002GYTPAE Audio Technica AT-LP60 Turntable]] played his copy before I listened to mine, and even on that it sounded really good. I'm very picky about sound quality (ask my wife and friends whom I drive nuts with my pedantic quirks when it comes to sound) and I honestly couldn't stop listening to this album.<br /><br />Back home, I played my copy on a [[ASIN:B000FMNBXG Denon DP-300F Turntable]] which runs an Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge. This is hooked up to a [[ASIN:B00AVXLKSC Pro-Ject Audio Phono Box S preamplifier]] & a [[ASIN:B0081N91BM Marantz SR7007 AV Receiver]]. When I started out by playing \\"Enter Sandman\\", I just couldn't get over how clean, crisp, clear and dynamic the sound was. There are absolutely no ticks and pops and the background is just totally black! I'd never heard so much clean detail from this track and I was simply blown away. \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" seems to have been a problem area for some folks here, but I for one had absolutely no issues with that track whatsoever. The \\"S\\" sounds on that track are definitely more pronounced than others, which means your cartridge and preamp/amp needs to be setup absolutely perfectly in order to reproduce this properly, anything that's off could lead to either an over or under emphasis on that \\"S\\" sound. An over emphasis will create splatter while an under emphasis could make it sound more like \\"Z\\" than \\"S\\", so in a way, you could actually usethis track to re-check your setup.<br /><br />I recorded a voice note using my iPhone 4S and although the clip is dynamically challenged, you can still here \\"S\\" sounds being clearly reproduced, here's a link: http://db.tt/gK8acD9u. I'd recommend listening to it on headphones at a higher volume.<br /><br />Overall, apart from philosophical differences that folks might have on the quality of the music in this album, if you like this album and are a vinyl collector, this is a MUST HAVE! I recommend it very highly.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Bought this for a visit from my 11 yr old grand-daughter.  She absolutely loved it and of course so does grandma.  Love to watch movies with my grandchildren.
0307888908|5.0|Also great for reinvention at 46 years old.  Ready to get moving in a new direction after reading.  A book that is dead on for today's market!
031236198X|4.0|I really liked the book.  It was easy and quick to read, but the concepts were able to be retained.  When you use a story to explain the concept of change management, things just seem more practical and relatable.  In using the story, one could transfer the actions to situations in one’s own life.  It just proves again that things don't have to be complicated to show importance.  Like, &#34;Who Moved My Cheese?”, a story is used to teach about how to adapt to and manage change.  I like this book and would recommend it to others interested in making necessary changes in their lives or organizations.
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|I am a big fan of these guys and couldn't wait to purchase this volume of music. I could only hope to be half as good as these guys are on the keys by the time i kick the bucket, LOL.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is a lot of fun they changed it now its different from before but its more fun and challenging u will love it
B007KOYEOC|3.0|Obviously 3 books in the series was one too many.  the book is getting monotonous and boring, even the lascivious bits.  Only worth reading on a long journey when there is nothing else to read!
B00BVDNKSY|2.0|The Good: Great 8-bit soundtrack, quick to get into<br /><br />The Bad: Headache inducing visuals, ridiculously difficult, hardly a game at all, why bother?<br /><br />Super Hexagon is a game where I can say it's barely that, in fact it's a game you might quite in less than one minute. I don't know what the designers were thinking, but this game is so hard that it becomes no fun in less than 5 minutes. You are just a triangle rotating around a circle trying to find your way through gaps in a giant hexagon that closes in on you. I couldn't get past 28 seconds of survival, and that was after I memorized every stage and died about 50 times.<br /><br />That's really all I can say about this game because it's hardly a game at all. The graphics are so simple with just basic colors and shapes, the only praise I can give this game is the awesome 8-bit soundtrack. The game requires memorization and super fast twitch reflexes to win. It doesn't help that there are only hard difficulties, nothing easy to start out with. It doesn't help that the visuals will give you a headache in less than 10 minutes and it just hurts your eyes. I like the fact that the game is trying to be challenging, but I'm glad I didn't pay much for this game.<br /><br />With that said I really can't recommend this to many people unless you are seriously hardcore, but the majority of players will uninstall it in less than 5 minutes. Why play a game that takes over 20 minutes of practice just to advance past the 30 second mark? I honestly don't understand why this game was even made or what audience this was supposed to be for. I really can't say much else for this game because there just isn't anything there to say, it's hardly a game as it is.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Have to say this is one of the better remakes I've seen come through in a long time. Effects are so much better these days too, but the story, action, and humor were the perfect mix to bring my wife on board.  She even wants to see the new one now. Best 3 dollars I ever spent
B002I0J5FG|4.0|Ico<br /><br />The Good: Nice HD upgrade, clever level and puzzle design, leading Yorda around is a great mechanic<br /><br />The Bad: Janky animations and mechanics, Yorda's AI is really dumb, not much of a story, can be beaten in 4 hours, too much backtracking<br /><br />Ico is probably one of the most forgotten games in history. Being one of the first graphical powerhouses for the PS2, it proved that you don't need a complex story and characters to have a good game. All you know is that you are a boy named Ico who is trying to save a girl named Yorda from her evil mother queen and escape from the castle. You enter as a captured prisoner because you have horns. You then escape and find Yorda along the way. What made Ico such a big deal was that you led her around manually by holding R1. This forced you to become attached to her, and they rarely spoke.<br /><br />This game was way ahead of its time. That's probably why people passed it by for Jak & Daxter and other PS2 games at the time. The game consists of some pretty cleverly designed puzzles that involve pulling switches, climbing, cutting ropes, and swinging on chains. You also push and pull the occasional block. The level design is really well done, but there were a few obscure puzzles like jumping off of a chain to knock a bridge down. This is completely against the game's mechanics so you would never know to do this. Leading Yorda around sounds annoying, but it prevents you from having to rely on the already shoddy AI. The game mechanics work well enough in design but they are sloppy and frustrating to deal with.<br /><br />When you jump Ico tends to clip into ledges and ladders making you have to slightly adjust him until he latches on. If you press the analog stick just slightly and jump he will jump 20 feet causing you to jump off ledges or fall down to your death. There's just so much bad collision detection and the animations are janky and not well done. When you drag Yorda around her arm looks like a flopping noodle that can go through her body. I know this was originally designed for PS1 before the game jumped ship to PS2...but still. There are other mechanics like setting your sword down to pick up a giant stick, light it on fire, then set off a bomb. Some times you have to toss these before they blow you up. Fun game mechanics and all but they repeated through the entire game making you be grateful for the short length (just about 4 hours).<br /><br />A lot of times I didn't know where to go because the middle of the game has two areas that are identical, but just slightly different. The constant backtracking can confuse you requiring a walkthrough. There are no boss battles to speak of except the final boss, but the combat is so frustrating and annoying. Ico swings his sword around aimlessly and you can't move while doing so. The AI jumps away as soon as you run after it so if you get stuck in a three hit combo you get knocked down and Yorda gets dragged away. You can't die in this game during combat, but if Yorda gets dragged underground you're done. You can pull her out of the hole, but some times a shadow creature will hit you and knock you back then you have to suffer the long animation of getting up. A lot of games had these animations (The Mark of Kri) and I don't know why. It breaks the fluidity of everything. Once you get the hidden mace in the game combat is really easy, but you still get annoyed by the creatures constantly backing up when you approach.<br /><br />The graphics look great with the new HD upgrade, but even back then they were amazing. A lot of textures have been slightly upscaled and some bloom and HDR has been added for better lighting. You can still notice the game's age during up close shots of areas. Textures are muddy and so blurry they don't even look like what they are representing. The main thing is that you can pan the camera around more now that the resolution has been bumped up making navigation easier. This is how you do HD upgrades right.<br /><br />Overall, Ico is a great game, but the dated mechanics really show their age. If you can look past all this you are in for a great, albeit short, game but don't expect engaging characters or a complex story. There are 4 cut scenes in the whole game, but this is about the journey and not the story.<br /><br />Shadow of the Colossus<br /><br />The Good: Fantastic graphics, slaying each colossus is exhilarating, beautiful atmosphere and visuals, touching ending<br /><br />The Bad: Not much story, pretty short, frustrating controls and game mechanics<br /><br />I have been wanting to review this game forever, and now I have the chance. I played this back in 2005 when it first came out and it was just unreal. SotC still has some of the best graphics to grace the PS2, it almost looked next-gen at the time. Of course it suffered from massive slowdown, but now we can play it with some extra graphical effects and at 60FPS. There's not much of a story here, there never is with Famito Ueda's games. You are a boy named  Wander who brings a girl to a temple, a cursed land, and vows to destroy all 16 colossi in order to bring her back to life. The game has one of the most touching endings I can remember.<br /><br />The game is very basic, you just head to each colossus and slay it. There is a huge open world, but it is very barren and void of life, but that's the away it is supposed to be. You feel very alone and helpless in this land of brown and gray. You have two weapons, a sword and a bow. You can hold the sword up to the light to guide you to the next colossus which really isn't that hard. Once you find it you have to figure out how to get on top of it and that's the tricky part. Each colossus is completely different. Some are tall, some are fat, some are the size of a lion. These lumbering beasts will attack, but you need to find their weak spots. One colossus has weak spots on the bottom of its feet. When it walks you need to use your bow and shoot it. It then falls over and you can jump up and grab its fur and start climbing. Some aren't so easy, in fact there are no hints on how to get on top of these beasts. One tricky water serpent requires you to swim over him and then his tail will come out of the water so you can grab it.<br /><br />The best part is when  you get on these things. Each colossus is like a level in itself. You can to climb around and hold the R1 button to stay on. They will try to shake you and your window to actually stab the glowing weak spots is really small. You have a stamina meter and when it depletes you let go and fall back down. This can be really frustrating if getting on top of the colossus is already frustrating or a long fiasco. As you slay these monsters your stamina and health increase, but you still need to watch out. The worst part about the game are the God awful controls. They just suck and the game mechanics are sluggish and unresponsive. If it weren't for this the game would be perfect. Wander's animations are a bit jerky and when the colossi shake you and your stamina is dropping you just want to charge your stab and kill it, but sure enough you get shaken again right as you start to charge. Wander flops around and it just feels sluggish. When you try walking on the colossus Wander will fall and tumble, some times right down to the ground. I almost threw my controller several times because of this. You will mainly die because of the mechanics, not your skills.<br /><br />Let's talk about your horse. Aggro is a main character, but I felt like I was driving a Mac truck. He won't move if you push the stick forward, instead you have to mash X and it takes forever for his momentum to get going. You can only tap the stick left and right to steer him, but he moves too quickly and runs right into walls, which he then stops on a dime and turns completely around. Maneuvering through tight areas is a serious pain. The horse controls are just terrible. This is probably the only bad part about the game, there is nothing else like this game out there. The colossi themselves look fantastic and are just gigantic. You really feel helpless and wonder how you are going to take this thing down. It all adds to the foreboding atmosphere of the game, the loneliness and helplessness that you feel throughout.oot it. It then falls over and you can jump up and grab its fur and start climbing.

B0058YPG2K|5.0|Most exciting show on TV I would recommend it to any adult that enjoys a good story with adventure, comedy and action. This is my favorite show ever on TV.
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|This was a fascinating movie to see, I purchased it because I believe a sequel is coming out so I wanted to re-acquaint myself with the movie as well as show my girlfriend. This is a movie that mainly men would appreciate so I would not recommend it to most women but it had a lot of action and fight scenes that were very entertaining to say the least.
B0050BPIB0|5.0|Lovely music at any time!  I just discovered Pablo Alboran and I recommend him to my Spanish students.  Very good!
B0081KZ20E|5.0|Exciting novel that is quite a page turner. A must read for those who are enthralled by this genre. Great
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Great service and great ebook!<br />The book lived up to all its reviews.<br />The service is instant and that works for me.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This arrived really well packaged, and promptly - It is a heartrendering interpretation of the story and it made me cry.  The acting was superb
B005PR422K|4.0|The big takeaway for me was to test your assumptions, which I'll be doing rigorously from now on. I was in the middle of a traditional business plan when I was referred to this book by somebody whom I am very grateful pointed me in the the direction of the Lean Movement.
B00CI21EBC|5.0|The Brand New Heavies are like fine wine, they get better with age and this album is a wonderful treat to all the Heavies fans.  From beginning to end all the songs are fantastic, no album fillers or weak tracks.  Lots of deep bass filled funk jams and it's great to have N'dea on board.  They have a very uncanny way of creating a vibe that is distinctly theirs.  While their overall vibe/sound is reminiscent of the 70's they do it in such a way that it doesn't seem like it's old, that is to say you don't feel like you are stuck in a time-warp, they truly do keep it moving FORWARD!  Great job guys, keep it forever Heavy!!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I will miss Robb, his brave mother, and his dire wolf brother.<br />A great read, but can not stand alone.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|This book was slow at first and frustrating because you would get into one storyline and the chapter would end.  I don't like that they killed my favorite characters!
B002ZG9968|1.0|This movie was alright, but it would make much more sense to rent this for a buck than to buy it. As a chick flick enthusiast, this movie does not pass the bar, but meets the bare minimum for a &#34;feel good&#34; movie.
0140042520|5.0|The book portrays colleague Gary Synder as the lead character into Jack Kerouac movement into Buddism.  It's an excellent analysis of the era of the Beat Generation.
B002WY65VU|5.0|When it comes to zombie movies, I usually like the ones that are not overdone, have great acting, have a good/unique plot, and make you feel for the characters. However, this movie made me laugh so hard that I really didn't care if the plot made sense or if it was &#34;realistic.&#34; The humor and the unique personalities of the characters made this movie awesome. I'd even recommend it to people that are generally not into zombie movies. It's really more of a spoof of zombie movies.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Please add all of the animals from the PC version. Then this game would be so much better. It's so much fun to play on Kindle Fire!
B000JG9ZXI|5.0|It is strange to read after having just watched this movie how underrated it is compared to many of Hitchcock's supposed \\"classics\\" (think Vertigo, Psycho, North By Northwest etc). We found this to be an absolute classic. Not just the cinematography along the glorious Mediterranean, the ever debonair Grant or the spectacular Grace Kelly (has there ever been a more beautiful leading lady), but how nicely the story weaves with crisp dialogue and suspense. It is impressive to see a master tell a taut edge of the seat story without excessive violence, crude language and non-value adding sex, yet still deliver sex appeal that leaps off the screen even 60 years later! One word only describes: brilliant.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|The 8th season was fantastic!!!  More proof that the writers only have more and more interesting directions to go!  Love this show.  Can't wait for season 9.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great story plot. Makes you want to continue the series. Just wish I could download the next book.<br />Thank you

0307719774|5.0|i love 5 year journals - they give you enough space to write just a little bit of info for each day.  love the setup of daily questions...it's amazing to look back at what your thoughts were a year or two ago!
B000088E6D|5.0|I love michael Buble this is a good cd if you want to just sit back and relax . sincerly april
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Rod Stewart did an excellent job on the album.  It is like the old Rod Stewart.  Easy listening and great for sitting around and thinking.
143911000X|4.0|Obviously you must be a fan of the show to get the Bro code...My son loved it- thought it was funny.  Great book to give for the big fans of the show!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod does an excellent job and the Christmas classics.  Very easy listening and his classic voice makes the selections easy to listen to.
1609611543|5.0|This book has really opened my eyes to the hazardous consequences of the genetic engineering of food products, especially wheat. I already feel better and have lost a few pounds with no effort. I will be eating more foods that are natural plants and far fewer foods processed in plants from now on. This should be required reading for every bureaucrat employed at the FDA, the NIH and the Dept. of Agriculture, as well as for everyone concerned at all about the epidemics of diabetes and obesity in the US today.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love it!!! you cant beat it. it is so adicting it rocks your socks off get it get it :-)!
B00BSWMITK|5.0|I have to start my review by saying that I have all of Satriani's albums, live and studio, have seen him in concert three times and have spoken to him twice.  All this means that I am a huge fan and always eagerly await his next album.  He threw me for a little bit of a loop, considering he'd been putting out a studio album pretty much every two years until this one, which comes three years after the very satisfying Black Holes And Wormhole Wizards.  But Unstoppable Momentum is certainly worth the wait.<br /><br />The title track is fabulous and unrelenting, a stellar opener for the album.  I also really enjoy the second track Can't Go Back, and the third track, Lies And Truths is outstanding, with a menacing opening that gives way to brilliant guitar play and one of Satch's most adventurous solos.  I'm not crazy about the fourth track Three Sheets To The Wind.  The opening keyboard sequence is rather annoying, and repeats itself throughout the song, although it does pick up a bit in the middle.  Not his worst song ever, but certainly the worst on this album.  The fifth track, I'll Put A Stone On Your Cairn, is nothing special, essentially minute-and-a-half filler.  The title is longer than the song.  The rest of the album is spectacular.  My favorite track is the next, A Door Into Summer.  It begs to be played loudly, and is, in my view, a sort-of sequel to the unforgettable Summer Song.  Shine On American Dreamer (perhaps a little Pink Floyd influence?) is muscular road music.  The next two tracks, Jumpin' In and Jumpin' Out are inexorably linked, with the first of the two having maybe a little more teeth, and the second a certain brooding quality to it.  The aptly-named The Weight Of The World deceives with an easy opening piece, before giving way to the pounding relentless strength of the drums and the accompanying keyboards and the melancholy beauty of the guitar.  A powerful song.  The finisher is the brisk and happy A Celebration, a great way to close the album.<br /><br />Unlike other reviews, I thoroughly enjoy Mike Keneally's keyboard work here (despite my indifference toward the track Three Sheets To The Wind, as mentioned previously), as I also did in the Black Holes album.  Whether he's playing out front with Joe, or in the background driving the song, I thoroughly enjoy his talents in these last two albums.<br /><br />And what can I say about Satch that hasn't been said already?  He is, of course, an incomparable virtuoso and worthy of being counted among the best rock guitarists ever.  This gem of an album only adds to his brilliant resume, and proves that there appears to be no end in sight to the master's musical prowess.um.<br /><br />Unlike other reviews, I thoroughly enjoy Mike Keneally's keyboard work here (despite my indifference toward the track Three Sheets To The Wind, as mentioned previously), as I also did in the Black Holes album.

B00BYKIKJS|5.0|This movie shows real life struggles with mental illness and how people can overcome bad choices in their lives. The characters in this movie had great chemistry together which makes it easy to watch and love.
1401322786|3.0|With all of Albom's books, they always make you think about life and what is really important. This was my least favorite out of all of is books, but I read it anyway.  Luckily it was very short, but I did like the ending.
