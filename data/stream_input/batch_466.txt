B00005JN2Z|5.0|Another amazing movie for 2004...this one is one of my favorites!  An exciting and intriguing story, mixed with trippy filming make for one awesome movie!  All the stars deliver with exceptional acting, especially Jamie Foxx...he's incredible!  This film blew my mind, and should be essential viewing if you're up for an intense, yet sophisticated wild ride!
0060594888|4.0|This a wonderful book with may great quotes by exceptional people. A treasure chest of inspiration. But it's a what-to-do book, not a how-to-do-it book. The quote - \\"Believe it's possible\\" is right on target, but can you change a limiting belief just by thinking - I believe it's possible? Belief is not changed so easily, because it's what you have no doubt about, not what you'd like to think is true.<br /><br />Ray Dodd, author of \\"The Power of Belief\\"
B0006A9FMI|1.0|..However, I was not happy about the fact that it is such a lame release. I LOVE Ghost In Th Shell, the Original, and I could not wait for this film. The artwork IS breathtaking, and it really is an amazing piece of filmwork... but all of the DVD features that it actually does have... suck. There is no English dubbing, which is nice to have when you want to follow the animation, and really enjoy the beauty of some of the screenshots.<br /><br />As with many of the other reviewers, I am not going to recommend you buy this.. but you may like to own this, so that if and when 'they' re-release it.. you can have it as a collectors item. We ARE Americans, and we do collect things, so that may be the only appeal of getting this DREAMWORKS release. Otherwise, save your cash, borrow it from a friend, and wait for the re-release.
B0002WYS6S|4.0|4.5 stars. I am writing this review from the point of view of someone totally new to Dream Theater (and a musician). Much of the new hard rock/metal coming out lately is terrible. They all sound the same, have the growling cookie monster vocals, and no guitar solos. Boy I hope that trend fades fast. So I find myself checking out bands that I missed on the first run. Dream Theater is one of them. Based on the reviews, I figured this DVD would be a great start, and that is was. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. The sound is good (for a concert DVD), the camera work is perferct,  and the performance is awesome. I will add to the comments on James Labrie. He is a GOOD vocalist, not a great vocalist. When you are only good, and you are fronting a band of GREAT players, your flaws will stand out. His flaw is that he is pushing his register 85% of the time, which makes annunciation of words difficult. You will need the subtitles to understand what he is singing. But he works as part of the whole package. The only other flaw with this DVD is the bass mix. It is totally buried in the mix. Enough of the negative. This is one of the best concert DVDs that I own, and I have many. Buy this one, you will not regret it. Warning to Guitarists and keyboardist, you may want to hang it up after viewing this.
B000002MU3|3.0|LOL, you can buy this used for about a penny! That must mean it's terrible, right? Not really, in fact..\\"Monster\\" is quite good! After the melancholy chamber sweep of \\"Automatic For the People\\", R.E.M. went 180 and cranked up their guitars, thus creating a murky mess of grunge and glam with distortion galore.     \\"Crush With Eyeliner\\" is a sleazy slice of pounding glam rock. It's irrelevent, but it's catchy and fun. Same with \\"Star 69\\", which has one of the dumbest choruses ever (\\"I know you called, I know you called, I know you hung up - Star 69\\").    The distortion-laden ballad \\"Let Me In\\" was written after Kurt Cobain's suicide. Michael's bittersweet falsetto soars the chorus into 'genuinely affecting' territory.      \\"Bang & Blame\\" bears a similar verse melody to that of \\"Losing My Religion\\", but the blasting guitar chorus shatters the resemblance.     Another great song is the soulful, delicate \\"Tongue\\", in which Michael Stipe croons in falsetto (the whole time) over an old-timey piano and an organ.     Other highlights include the techno-glam mashup \\"King of Comedy\\", the ballad \\"Strange Currencies\\", the punky \\"Circus Envy\\", and of course, the noise soaked pop of \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" (the song that caused people to buy this album in droves).     There's a few dull songs on here, but all and all, this is honestly a good album. And it's cheaper than a gumball; talk about bang for your buck!     Best Songs: Let Me In, Strange Currencies, Crush With Eyeliner, Tongue, Bang & Blame.
B0006399FS|5.0|Excellent cd. Favorite tracks are Vertigo, City of Blinding Lights. Give it 5 out of 5. About time U2 had a new album
B00001OH7P|5.0|After 1971's \\"Hunky Dory\\" (his first true classic), David Bowie created a conceptual album based on a ficticious rock star named Ziggy Stardust. Perhaps an alter-ego of sorts? Bowie has been known to reside in those, after all. Ziggy Stardust is quite androngynous, soaked in lipstick, eyeshadow, make-up, and sporting a mane of reddish/orange hair. This album chronicles the rock star's rise and fall (as the title suggests).    So, is this is true concept album? Yes, but it falls apart at times. It's not like \\"The Wall\\", where every song is a vital part to a complex story. But the songs do fit together nicely. And there is a definite semblance of a story being told. Anyway, \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" is commonly referred to as a landmark album in 'glam rock'. I'm not an expert, but isn't glam rock that really cartoonish, early 60's styled rootsy rock n' roll type stuff? Like Alice Cooper? If so, only a couple songs on here would actually qualify as 'glam rock'.     However, don't think of this album in terms of a certain genre. It covers lots of ground. \\"Five Years\\" and \\"Rock n' Roll Suicide\\" are both epic-style ballads that open and close the album, respectively. The latter has a great build-up; it starts off hushed, and culminates with an emotional ending in which David screams, \\"You're not alone!\\" over swelling strings. It sends chills down my spine every time.    The good songs don't end there, either. If you want another fine ballad, try \\"Lady Stardust\\" - a stylish, Elton John-like number with a soaring chorus. And \\"Soul Love\\" is, appropriately enough, soulful mid-tempo pop that hints at the direction David would take on 1975's \\"Young Americans\\".     If you want rockers, there's plenty of those too. There's the sleazy, rollicking  \\"Suffragate City\\" (now that's glam-rock), the dreamy \\"Star\\" (complete with 'sha-la-la-la' backing vocals), the infectious \\"Hang On To Yourself\\" (which sounds like an ancestor of punk), and the swirling psychedelia of \\"Moonage Daydream\\".     That's not it either. You've got a little blues (\\"It Aint Easy\\", a Ron Davies cover), dream-pop (\\"Starman\\", with its saccharine, 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow'-redux chorus), and stadium-sized artsy/guitar rock/ballad on the title track.    Some consider this David Bowie's best album. Some don't. He certainly has a ton of classics, so it's impossible for me to choose an overall favorite. At any rate, \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" is right up there. It's a cool concept, and the songs are all great. All of them. So, what more could you ask for?    Highly Recommended.    Best Songs: Rock n' Roll Suicide, Moonage Daydream, Star, Hang On To Yourself, Five Years.
B00005JMYI|1.0|I know, we can have Jack Black with road-rage kick the poor sap's dog off a bridge, that would be hil-arious....not. What a way to lose your audience. You might want to watch Old School again instead. A far better effort.
B0006399FS|1.0|it gives me sad yet to see some  fans celebrating this filth of 49 minutes titled HTDAAB. Sure U2 knows perfectly that they don't have to make an effort in a 60 minutes long album, since they always will have blinded fans that eats from the Bono's empty words.  <br /> <br />Bono now is a very rich and avaricious men ( musician ? ), that he only wishes that you have a credit card and don't think about the awful U2 dying.  <br />If you have much money, credit cards and all that stuff, you're so much important for Bono. But if you don't have anything of that, you're a loser.  <br />And some fans still support his wallet...  <br /> <br />They have officially lost us as a fan. We can't stand this iPod product wrongly credited as \\"U2\\". They have settled in nicely in their superstar status, courtesy of some U2 fans. <br /> <br />This is the horrifying sound of an absolute creative vacuum, there's nothing left but the heinous hubris of rockstar ego. And it's a really boring ego. It's music only a mother can love. A bunch of drunk teens may finish and record a by far better record. Keep your memories, play the old stuff and most importantly, save your money. We should be paid to listen to this. <br />\\"You need many listens to grows on you\\" pointed out some fans. Not true, you need many listens to think artificially by being generous with U2 that this commercial fraud is not so bad. The only thing that \\"grows on me\\" is the dissapointment and the sensation of being ripped off by this record company - Grammy and MTV friendly -called \\"U2\\". <br /> <br />Let's face the truth: Yet some fans think \\"it's the best since Achtung Baby !!\\"... Just \\"Stay\\", \\"Staring At The Sun\\" or \\"Please\\" alone blow away this recycled album. Bono sings like a drunkard with laryngitis, The Edge is a joke of himself once again, and Adam and Larry don't exist here. their bubble has burst and they are stuck in the mud. Used \\"messages\\", irrelevant songs. Just more of the same cockie. They spent more time focused in marketing campaing than anything else.  <br /> <br />Yes my friends, U2 should cancel their fake \\"Atomic Bomb\\" Tour as an apologize to all us, it's time to disband and most important, THEY MUST START RESPECTING FANS AT LAST. <br /> <br />
B000003C2U|5.0|Music is the most loved and experienced form of art. Everyone is part of music in some way. And just like some paintings and other forms of art, there are pop forms of music, meant to be acessable and widely acceptable. However, the same way different short term movements in art come and go, pop music is forgettable. There are no deicated pop music fans, it's an oxymoron. However, death metal fans are easily the most devoted fans of any genre of popular music. With no airplay, M.A, Deicide and of course, death sold millions of albums in the early nineties. Chuck does the death metal fan justice with this album. He understands that death metal is a more serious form of art, and this ablum reflects that. His guitar work is masterful and very persice and his songwriting is amazing. His lyrics are also worthy, taking a serious view on the world around him, providing many insights and asking many hard to answer questions. Chuck did begin to veer away from death metal toward the last 5 years of his life, but that was not a horrible thing. What he wanted to do was create a more comerical band with a stronger vocalist, which is not to say he was selling out. Chuck was an artist and the truly great artists change and grow, branch out to experiment with new styles, techniques and ideas. It is truly a tragedy that Chuck died before he ever moved on past death. It was the loss of an artistic great.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|i saw (no pun intended...lol) i was this at the movies and thought it was a great suspense thriller... it will keep you captivated and on the edge of your seat till the end. i have it a 4 star rating cause i felt the movie could have been alot better and more in depth about each character, puzzles, and actors.... overall great movie and i will buy it when it comes out....
B00000J7JO|5.0|Just like the Beatles \\"revolver\\" clearly paved the way for \\"sgt. pepper\\", this album is fantastic in it'w own right, pointing forward to the the bands masterful \\"By the Way\\" album. Although in my opinion BTW is their best album, this album is great too, and was the begining of them really making great albums.  Everyone knows the singles on here, and some great album cuts include the beautiful \\"This Velvet Glove\\", mindblowing \\"Parellel Universe\\", the slightly dark \\"Easily\\", and the fun \\"Right On Time\\".  A couple of the songs on here are a waste of time; \\"Purple Stain\\" is long and uninteresting, and \\"Get On Top\\" is just plain noisy.  The band made a quantum leap forward on the next album BTW (especially Anthony's singing and John's guitar playing), but this album sets a firm foundation on which they've managed to build BTW and hopefully many more great albums.
B000683VI4|5.0|Most people snub romance stories when they are textbook and typical.  But its because most of those people have never really taken the time to SEE what real love is.  This story is a great movie because it demostrates the perfect fairytale love that overcomes obstacles and time and finds its true place.  This story may be the same ol thing.  But it still is a great, heartwarming story that really touches your heart and helps you realize how important love truly is.  This move is a 5 star movie, A MUST for any romantic.

0780631684|5.0|his film could just as easily be named \\"Murphy's Law\\" for the undercurrent dynamic occurring, composing the entire plotline.<br /><br /> A planeful of high school students are off to France - as they prepare to take off, one of the students receives a morbid vision while dozing off, that the craft will dismember & burn. He awakens startled by the lightmare,  to find that he indeed is on the same plane, as a couple of subtle cues are revealed to confirm his vision. He panics, & is escorted off the plane along with his friend, a nemesis-antagonist,  his girlfriend, & a beautiful solitary girl who decides, luckily for her, to heed his warnings, although she also has a touch of clairevoyant sensitivity herself. As they are detained by security, they all witness the said aircraft explode in the air. Subsequently, all those that are involved with the clairevoyant meet with a gruesome fate.<br /><br /> Of note, one girl, depressed by the events, seeks to alleviate her mind with a mugful of vodka, but the mug mysteriously forms minute cracks which leaves a trail from the kitchen t the den area, where lays the PC - several drops cascade into  the monitor causing a spark, & eventually an explosion, which sends a shard of glass into her neck, causing her to bleed profusely, upon which she slips & slides on her own blood, stumbling towards the kitchen, where the cutlery falls into disarray; at this point, a shower of sparks ignites the trail of vodka, & the fire persues her until she is aflame, after which a butcher knife dislodges from its holster, dropping down, impaling her.<br /><br /> Such scenes typify the ghoulish deaths throughout the film, all of  which are deserving of a D.O.A. {Drac's Overkill Award}.

0792839749|4.0|This film followed the recipe of the highly successful Mary Poppins, including the same songwriters (the Shermans) and the same cast (Dick Van Dyke).  Although it's a fun film, it does not really measure up to its prototype.  <br /> <br />The film has Disney-fied the charmingly eccentric family of Caractacus Potts, a wacky inventor who lives in a dilapidated windmill.  In the book (believe it or not, by Ian Fleming, the writer of the James Bond books), Caractacus is truly and humorously eccentric, but Dick Van Dyke as Potts plays the part pretty much as as a Wonderbread romantic lead: all Caractacus' odd behaviors are pretty much erased, and with it a lot of the fun of the book.  In 1968 I wanted to be his love interest, Miss Truly Scrumptious, an heiress with both a spunky attitude and lovely clothes, but in 2004 I wish she's been given more to do.  <br /> <br />Finally, there is such a thing as a song being TOO singable - the title song - the heroine's song \\"Truly Scrumptious\\" - are so melodic they are unforgettable, although  you are likely to wish you could get them out of your head.   <br /> <br />I remember really liking this one when I was a kid, although it does not hold up as well as Mary Poppins herself. Nevertheless, watching it with small children was an entertaining evening at home.  <br />
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Thirteenth Step is a cd mainly about addiction, and how it is viewed from different perspectives. I now offer you a track-by-track walkthrough of the album, and what I make of the songs, songmeanings, et cetera. <br /> <br /> <br />Track 1-The Package: <br />This song, for the first half is a somewhat calm, mostly drum and vocals track. However, just as it's near lulled you to sleep with it's beautiful rhythm and vocals, it takes a hard knee-jerk turn to hard guitars and creepy whisperings done by the vocalist(Maynard James Keenan). I believe the song is about someone who wants drugs, and doesn't care who he lies to or hurts to get to them. <br /> <br />Track 2-Weak And Powerless: <br />The advanced musicianship and constant changing of octives on Maynard's voice make Weak And Powerless a great listen over and over. It somehow always manages to keep the listener enticed with it's up, down, up, down, up, down feel. The song I believe is about the drug abuser realizing that he is slowly killing himself and needs help. <br /> <br />Track 3-The Noose <br />A beautiful slow song. I'm not quite sure what it's about, but one idea is that it's from the perspective of someone who knows someone who hurt people on drugs, but is reformed. And the person is saying to the ex-addict...\\"But how are you planning to go about making your amends to the dead?\\" Of ocurse that's not MY theory, just one of many I read ont he internet <br /> <br />Track 4-Blue <br />This has a rhythm of pure insanity, if you ask me. Very good, very catchy. But if anything sticks out abot this song, it's the guitar-playing. Crazy, in one word. I believe it's about someone in denial about how their loved one is on drugs, and they just want to deny it. They think the blue color of their skin goes good with their eyes. <br /> <br />Track 5-Vanishing <br />I don't actually think this song has much to it. In terms of meaning, anyway. The musicianship is awful nice, though. Especially at the beginning when you canbarely hear it, then by the second time they repeat it suddenly gets much louder after the count of Josh Freese on a bass-sounding drum. <br /> <br />Track 6-A Stranger <br />I'm clueless about the over all meaning of this song. But you can tell that it has one, a deep one. Maynard's vocals are absoloutely incredible, and so is the guitar-playing of Billy Howerdel. <br /> <br />Track 7-The Outsider <br />According to Maynard, this song is sung from the perspective of someone who absoloutely does not understand what it's like to be on drugs. IT's sort of like the jock brother saying \\"walk it off\\" or \\"just stop\\". They drumming on this one is phenomenal.  <br /> <br />Track 8-Crimes <br />In my opinion, there is no meaning. But some say it has to do with being on the virge of suicide. You know, holding the gun to your head and counting \\"1...2...3...\\" But the guitar definitely is great when it comes in. I know that the real focus of the song is supposed to be the drum beat, but to me it just seems like such a cliche beat that I won't glorify it here. <br /> <br />Track 9-The Nurse Who Loved Me <br />A Perfect Circle's cover of the song by Failure. The song seems very strange lyrically. \\"Say hello to the rug's topography, it holds quite a lot of interest with your face down on it\\", for example, is quite strange. Violin playing is phenomenal <br /> <br />Track 10-Pet <br />This song has great guitar playing by Billy Howerdel, and ery creepy lyrics sung by Maynard. The meaning of the song is that it's spoken by the addiction's personification into the addict's ear. But it's remix, \\"Counting Bodies Like Sheep To The Rhythm Of The War Drums\\", has a completely different meaning.  <br /> <br />Track 11-Lullaby <br />A humorous follow-up to Pet <br /> <br />Track 12-Gravity <br />The big closer. Finally just coming down from the addiction, and choosing to live. All put into the form of a beautiful song.
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|Mystic River does not deserve the negative reviews leveled against it; while I respect the views expressed by others, I'd like to address the grounds often used to criticize this unpretentious and disturbing film: <br /> <br />1.) For those who say it's \\"boring and slow\\": Don't we have enough films that presume a 2-second attention span on the part of the audience? The psychological content of the story demands careful development, and Eastwood constructs each scene with careful attention to details, always establishing an undercurrent--a suspenseful sense of the unknown. In an age where most films strive for gimmicky plot twists with Matrix-like special effects and camera angles, Eastwood returns us to the essence of any great film: a good screenplay, remarkable perfromances, and direction that doesn't interfere with the story. <br /> <br />2.) For those who say it's \\"predictable\\": The focus of this story is on the psychology of the characters; the plot twists may be predictable in some cases, but this in no way detracts from the depth of the intended themes. A story cannot rely on plot alone for it to be memorable; in fact, most plots since Shakespeare are fairly formulaic. People, however, never complain that they knew Hamlet was going to die--the art is in the substance. Mystic River gives us plenty to deal with. The tensions and nuances established by the characters are at the heart of this film, not its plot structure, however predictable some might deem it to be. <br /> <br />3.) For those who say that the \\"characters have no redeeming qualities\\": I don't want a film filled with \\"redeemable\\" characters, whatever that means. I want a story that rings true; the characters don't have to be heroes--they have to be human, and this film delivers. No one is flawless or free of peculiar and sometimes disturbing characteristics. If we're  reluctant to consider the darker aspects of ourselves, that's another matter, but as the film shows, people are too complex to be categorized neatly under the \\"redeemable\\" heading. <br /> <br />4.) For those who criticize the musical score: Some say, \\"I'm a musician, and Eastwood shouldn't compose because he only uses four notes repetitively.\\" Well, I'm a musician, too (self-taught and trained), and in this case, it hardly matters what credentials a musician has, really, or how many notes he uses. Eastwood's score is unassuming, and it does what it has to--complement the scenes without being bombastic. Who needs massive orchestration and complexity if it's uncalled for? The score doesn't distract us from the acting and the story, and I'm glad for that. As to Eastwood's status as a composer, that is also irrelevant since history is filled with musicians \\"without training\\" who have made their personalities felt. Eastwood had the courage to do it himself, and it's refreshingly free of pretense. I'm sure he doesn't think of himself as the next John Williams, and if he could do it himself, why not?  <br /> <br />Overall, it's a movie worthy of our attention for its stark honesty. This is one you can talk about and interpret--complete enough to pose the darkest questions, and wise enough to let each viewer search for the answers.
B00062ZE3U|5.0|This album is a work of pure genius. Within Temptation consists of six awesomely TALENTED musicians. And as a group they have created a wonderful work of art that surpasses any type of music I have ever heard in the United States. This record screams MASTERPIECE. It's unlike anything I have ever heard, if you like this record I suggest listening to WT's previous records. Unlike most of the music that's popular in the United States, this band stands alone as REAL MUSICANS. And REAL musicians are very hard to come by; especially here in the States. The music and the vocal compliments of Sharon Den Adel make this my favorite record of 2005. The combination of music, vocals, and artwork will surely make this record a classic. Not only does the band write their own music but they write their own lyrics as well! Bravo WT! And congrats on a work of pure genius!!! Although, I do hope the next album has more of a raw, heavier feel. I do miss the early WT music....although the new music is fantastic; I loved the grunts and the fact that the music was darker and heavier. \\"The Other Half(of me)\\" was brillant! Thank you for the inspiration your music has given to me and to thousands of other devoted fans around the world. Rock on!  \m/
0195067142|5.0|Volumes upon volumes have been written about the European theatre of operations during WW II, but it is difficult to find good books about the Pacific. That's a real shame considering the hardships and horrors endured by the men who served in that theatre. With the Old Breed was recommended to me by a college student who read it as part of a history class assignment. I don't know how this book managed to hide under my radar for so long, because it is absolutely outstanding. Too often, books written about a person's combat experiences are poorly written, but this plain-spoken book neither tries to be something it isn't nor falls short of good writing standards.<br /><br />I think what makes this one of the most unique personal accounts of war that I've ever read is Sledge's approach to telling his story. Nothing fancy, no poetic prose, and he doesn't engage in self-aggrandizement or philosophizing. It's just one veteran's very candid account of his experience during training and then later as a grunt in the Pacific theatre. Sledge tells it like he saw it, with no sugar-coating. His only real motive for telling his story in the first place seems to be that he had a story to tell and he felt like it was important enough to pass on to later generations. The reader will detect no attempt on Sledge's part to seek praise or admiration, despite the fact that he himself obviously suffered significantly and witnessed countless others who suffered far worse still. What the reader will get is an absolutely unimpeachable, through, and detailed account of what happened on Peleliu and Okinawa. No matter how much you know about World War II, this book will still take you on a breathtaking journey. Anyone who reads this book will have a new appreciation for what soldiers went through while fighting the Japanese during WW II. It is an essential part of any WW II buff's book collection.

B00005JN2Z|4.0|i really liked this movie, but the problem i have is that the role of the assassin is played by tom cruise. tom cruise. nobody is scared of tom cruise. he belongs in romantic dramas, not playing a contract killer. but if you can ignore that, collateral is a smart thriller keeping you on the edge of your seat. Foxx gives a good performance as the cab driver, steering away from his usual comedic roles. the scenery blends well with the movie, a nocturnal Los Angeles from the \\"glitz to the ghettos\\". some people such as me, can even find humor in tom shooting everybody. the plot never runs too terribly thin, though becomes hard to follow towards the end but picks itself up quickly.

I think Vince Gill was STUNNING. Larry Carlton & Steve Vai had great sets too. I watched Clapton standing right next to Eric Johnson who had a mind blowing set an the day before the huge Cotton Bowl show. I also got to meet Clapton at the very end of Vince Gills' set as Eric walked over to thank Vince.

0156711427|4.0|A Passage to India explores the clashing of two different cultures during the British rule over India. It starts out with Mrs. Moore and Miss Adela Quested coming to India to visit Mrs. Moore's son and Miss Quested's future husband, Ronny. Both ladies are wide-eyed and want to see what the \\"real\\" India is like. They long to have conversations with real Indians and to experience the life of India without British influence. Eventually, they meet Dr. Aziz, a local Indian physician, who tells them that he will show them the \\"real\\" India. Part of Aziz's \\"real\\" India is the nearby Marabar caves. He takes them to visit the caves where something happens that changes the entire story. As a result, relationships between the British and Indians are tested. <br /> <br /> The writing style of this novel is so eloquent in describing the world of British Raj in India in the early twentieth century, that it is also able to be applied to life today. Take this quote from page 272 of the novel, \\"Truth is no truth in that exacting land unless there go with it kindness and more kindness again, unless the Word that was with God also is God. And the girl's sacrifice - so creditable according to Western notions - was rightly rejected, because, though it came from her heart, it did no include her heart.\\" This passage stuck in my mind because it reminded me that even though this story was written over eighty years ago, its core and main message could still be applied to life today. <br /> <br /> E.M. Forester, the author of A Passage to India, writes in such a way that he pulls the reader back to India under British rule in 1924. Through his speech and way of describing the interactions between the English and Indians, I felt like I was actually in 1924 watching everything taking place. Forester is a perfect example of a \\"classic author.\\" His style is so polished, yet unique that he was able to create a novel that draws the reader in and makes the reader question life and humanity in general. I was especially impressed with Forester's sarcasm and his ability to be cynical of British rule of India, even though he was British himself. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. Although, at times, I did feel that some parts just dragged on and on, I do think that I was then able to truly appreciate and learn from the lives of Aziz, his friends, and the British. In the past, I have always heard of the British Raj in India, but I never truly understood the impact of the British on India until I experienced A Passage to India. <br />
B0006B2A2E|5.0|Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is another Jim Carey movie I wasn't too sure about. He's had a better track record lately with his more serious films, so I was willing to give it a shot. And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Combining all the mental hijinks of Memento and the mind-bending, \\"is this reality?\\" confusion of movies like Strange Days and eXistenz, the movie essentially posits one question: if you could erase any one experience from your mind, would you?<br /><br />But before we get to that question, we see Joel Barish (Jim Carey) meet Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) on a train. It's supposedly happenstance, and the two hit it off immediately. These first five minutes carry the whole movie. The two actors exhibit just enough nuanced familiarity that it's alternately exhilarating and creepy-they FEEL like they've known each other their entire lives. The rest of the movie then swings back to the circumstances leading up to their meeting.<br /><br />Joel has, in fact, met Clementine before and had a whirlwind romance that somewhere along the lines lost its whirl. They are strikingly different personalities who find attraction in their opposite: Joel is cautious, Clementine's a maniac. Joel is quiet (hard to believe Carey playing quiet, I know), Clementine is a bundle of energy. They alternately drive each other crazy and are crazy about each other. But unfortunately, the nature of the relationship is so tempestuous that the possibility of erasing one's memory is simply too tempting. Like a madman with a pocket nuke, it's inevitable that Clementine's personality will succumb to the lure of memory erasing...but the consequences have grave repercussions.<br /><br />Hurt and desperate, Clementine's brash decision pushes Joel to do the same thing. If she's going to erase him, well he's going to do the same thing right back at her! It's a procedure that takes an entire night and it's only a few days into the erasing of her memories that Joel realizes he LIKES his pain, his angst, his embarrassment, and even his hatred of her. The ups and downs, the good and bad parts of their relationship, are ultimately inseparable, and Joel realizes he will lose a part of his soul along with Clementine should his memory of her be erased.<br /><br />So he fights it. Thus have another plot thread, as Joel drags his memory of Clementine with him through the dark hallways of his mind. All the while, Joel is pursued in the real world by the Lacuna Memory Erasure team. Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) leads the team, a kindly father figure who is not nearly as nice as he seems. Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood) assist the good doctor, making an on-site visit to Joel's house. Which is at least as horrifying as it is comedic, because while Joel is in a drugged coma on his bed, Stan and Patrick eat his food, drink his beer, get high, and practically have an orgy in his apartment.<br /><br />Like Memento, Spotless Mind posits that when people aren't looking, the ethics of society don't just fall apart, they explode...whatever you imagine people might do to you while you're helpless is just the tip of the iceberg. Patrick proves just who unethical he is when we discover he has decided to take advantage of Clementine by recycling all of Joel's memories-memories that were supposedly destroyed to complete the erasure process.<br /><br />As if that weren't enough, Dr. Mierzwiak's assistant Mary (Kirsten Dunst), is dating Stan. The secret she uncovers about herself and her work will shatter the Lacuna program and the lives of all those who it touched.<br /><br />The director takes an innovative twist on how he conveys the dream world. Images become faded and indistinct. Sound crackles in and then whispers away. Some scenes appear to be lit exclusively by a flashlight, perfectly representing the selective memory of Joel's mind. Other scenes are lensed in distinct colors of yellow and blue. Still other scenes are nightmarish-people are faceless, bodies slide off into darkness, and as Joel's mind stumbles under the technological assault, structures and people literally collapse in front of him.<br /><br />Ultimately, it's Charlie Kaufman's writing that perfectly blends what could be a horrible mess. Just when you think all the various plotline could not possibly be resolved...we're back at that train, and the thrill and awkwardness of that first attraction.<br /><br />Spotless Mind is about the maturation of a romance and the decision every couple must go through when they realize that the \\"honeymoon is over.\\" Joel and Clementine come to a crossroads and stumble horribly astray, just as so many couples fall apart every day without the benefit of erasing the memories of their exes. Love, Kaufman seems to say, is about the person you are after the honeymoon is over.<br /><br />Carey is suitably restrained, which makes him seem all the more pathetic when the movie focuses on the happier, more energetic times. His hair is a mop top, is sweaters always rumpled. In short, he's a sad sack that Carey captures perfectly...a funny man who has nothing to laugh about.<br /><br />Dunst plays a perfectly awkward, clueless young girl dealing with a technology she does not understand. Her characters growth, destruction, and rebirth steals the show. The other characters are suitably dazed and confused, not the least of which is Wood's not-Frodo-anymore Patrick. He's so fresh-faced, it's hard to believe he's doing such disrespectful things to Clementine.<br /><br />But by far, Winslet plays the most compelling character of her career. Winslet not only adopts an American accent, she plays Clementine as herself (a sometimes whiny, neurotic mess), as Joel remembers her (erotically playful, maddeningly confusing, and sometimes just a shrew), and as echoes of Joe's memories. This is a lot to pull off for anybody, but Winslet never missed a beat.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest compliment I can give this movie is that I KNOW these people. See it, and you will too.rish-people are faceless, bodies slide off into darkness, and as Joel's mind stumbles under the technological assault, structures and people literally collapse in front of him. <br /> <br />Ultimately, it's Charlie Kaufman's writing that perfectly blends what could be a horrible mess.

B0002IVN9W|5.0|This album has great lyrics. Don't believe those who say that it is a rip-off. Yes, you'll listen to it and think of other bands, but this really adds great new information and perspective to the cultural conversation that is rock music. And you can really dance to it!

140004281X|5.0|These stories are subtle and lush and refract immense light. There is no relationship, especially any regarding women, that is not examined with great care and great insight. Alice Munro is one of the best at capturing women and the ties that bind us together, and sometimes these ties are subtle, and I love how artfully she manages this over the course of this collection. Make sure that you read the stories in order so you can absorb the connections back to previous people and events. \\"Runaway\\" may very well be as strong as \\"Friend of My Youth.\\" This and Jennifer Paddock's brilliant novel-in-stories \\"A Secret Word\\" are easily the best books I've read this year. Easily.
B000002HMH|1.0|I must say that the downturn for Metallica began with the Black Album. The intensity and high voltage sound was pretty much dying on that album. But now, this isn't even the same group.  I could care less if they decided to take their music in a \\"new\\" direction. But they should change their name. They are no longer a metal band. They are a pop band. Plain and simple. This belongs next to the Barry Manilow cds.  <br /> <br />We metal fans will just have to stick with Cannibal Corpse and Slayer. Which is fine with me, they both rock.

0553802534|2.0|I know that all the other reviewers rated this book as excellent, but for some reason, I could not get into this book.<br /><br />Gardner is trying to draw out her characters and I believe  that she is overdoing it.  She spends pages and pages in painful, boring details when all I want is action.<br /><br />A good example is an extremely long description about Bobby and the whole surrounding the target.  She gets into minute detail even about what size amunition he takes.  WHO CARES?  once all of this is done - the actual shooting is done in less  than 3 sentences.  BORING.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this tone is kept throughout the entire book.
B00005JNEW|4.0|: Showcasing the thrill, harsh reality, hardness and redemption of high school football in a economically depressed Odessa, Texas, Friday Night Lights strikes me as the perfect sports movie. The film balances out the importance of football to a small town, how the players use their abilities as their ticket out to college, the harsh competitiveness that eats at the coach and players and how essential the game is to the residents of the town.<br /><br />The town passed one bond in the last twenty years and that one bond was to build a $5 million stadium for the high school where the Permian Panthers play. A team with an amazing winning streak, the Permian Panthers had a difficult year in 1988 the year when writer H. G. Bissinger came to Odessa to write his book. The players on the team were smaller than in previous years, they had one star player that drove the team with other talented individuals supporting him. When Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) loses one of his key players on the drive to the state championship, he and his talented group of players must rethink their approach to the game.<br /><br />The pressure on the players and the coach is enormous. Everybody in town thinks they are experts at the game and give the coach advice implying that if he doesn't win, he'll need to find a new job. The kids are pressured by their parents who recognize that this game is the economic ticket for a lot of them that will lead them to better things. Charles Billingsley (Tim McGraw) an abusive alcoholic recognizes that this year will be the highlight of his son Don's (Garrett Hedlund) life. A mixture of jealousy, envy and pride drives him to alienated his son and push him to extremes (it should be noted that the character here in the film is not based on the real life Charles Billingsley). Filled with amazing performances from the young ensemble cast, Friday Night Lights will make you reconsider those boys who live for their moment on the field in high school. A rich glimpse into a part of America not often seen in films, Friday Night Lights  captures the importance these boys play to the town (they're treated like the Dallas Cowboys by locals) but also the uncertainty and pressure these BOYS feel as they turn out for the field every single day.<br /><br />A beautiful, transfer that captures the desolate landscape of Odessa, Texas very well. With rich, dark blacks as deep as the night sky Friday Night Lights looks beautiful. There are virtually no digital or analog imperfections to mar this nicely done transfer. The documentary cutting style of the film is nicely contrasted with the color and look of the film. The 5.1 mix makes effective use of all the channels placing the action all around the room. With remarkable clarity the 5.1 sounds terrific.<br /><br /> The 30 minute documentary on the real team profiled in the film acts as a nice reality check for the film. Featuring interviews with Don Billingsley, Mike Winchell, Boobie Miles and Brian Chavez, this footage provides a sense of balance and gives perspective to Berg's film. The only person missing from the film (either in older footage or current interview footage) is Gary Gaines. We also get behind-the-scenes footage that shows the actors and crew mugging and messing with each other. Although it's a bit redundant Peter Berg discusses the scene at the burger joint and why it was added to the final film during reshoots.<br /><br />In \\"Ryan's Player Cam\\" a player for the cinema version of the Permian Panthers takes his video camera and documents the making of the film with some fun behind-the-scenes footage. \\"Tim McGraw\\" off the stage highlights country singer McGraw being interviewed as to how he became interested in making the film. Berg and Grazer (with his bizarre Edward Scissorhands hair) provide their initial reaction to hearing about McGraw's interest and how they changed their minds when they heard what his take on the character was.<br /><br />Director Berg and hiscousin author Bissinger provide the play by play commentary for the film. Both discuss the reality vs. the fiction presented here and, while Berg has taken some liberties with the story, he has tried to keep it true to the roots of the story. Bissinger's comments provide interesting insights since he wrote the book and comments about how even the fictional scenes manage to capture what he felt was running under the surface of these characters and this town.<br /><br />Full of great action sequences and great drama, \\"Friday Night Lights\\" will make you take a different look at the kids that play football in high school.ctor Berg and his cousin author Bissinger provide the play by play commentary for the film.

0064407667|5.0|Hi! The Bad Beginning by Lemony Snicket( a series of unfortunate events ) is a very well written book. Instead of a little kid book where you always expect the ending to be happy (books aren't fun if you already know the ending). The story is about three intelligent siblings who's parents died in a fire that burned down their whole mansion. The parents left them with Count Olaf (a very intelligent villian) who is planning to steal the enormous fortune their parents left them with. Count Olaf's plan was almost a sucess, but the Baudelaires found out about it and fooled him. I definitely recomend this book.
B00007LTIL|4.0|I really don't like the Grateful Dead. Their loping rhythms are very pleasant, some of their songs are compelling, and Jerry Garcia's playing was occasionally brilliant. Unfortunately, none of them could ever really sing - not a problem with individual voices, but when they harmonize it can be excruciating. \\"Uncle John's Band\\" on _Workingman's Dead_ makes me run for the hills every time. I saw the Dead live once (_Shakedown Street_ tour, I believe), and all I got was a headache. <br /> <br />This CD, though, has grown on me enough that I can actually put it in and enjoy most of it. Here the harmonies have been worked out to the best benefit of their mediocre voices. They lyrics are goofy, but they sing well. The playing is quite fine. And, most importantly, some of the songs - especially \\"Candyman\\" and \\"Ripple\\" - are quite beautiful. <br /> <br />I'd say get this just so that you have one Grateful Dead recording. They were a phenomenon, if not a particularly inventive or consistently good band, and this recording captures that nicely and concisely for me.

B0006399FS|3.0|There is a wide range of opinions and views on Amazon, which could lead you to believe that U2 has either hit a brick wall in terms of their creativity or written some songs that harken back to their glory days.  My best guess is that the truth lies somewhere in between. <br /> <br />I suspect that I'm like a lot of people out there -- casual fans who were drawn in by the spectacular All That You Can't Leave Behind and eager to see what the band would do for an encore.  The rollicking, uber-IPod anthem, \\"Vertigo\\", certainly set a high standard and piqued pre-release interest. <br /> <br />However, much of what follows \\"Vertigo\\" on How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is tepid and mid-tempo, similar to some of the fare found on All That You Can't if lacking in grandeur and execution.  Yes, Bono sounds a little strained at times and the lyrics sound a little tired, but overall new and old fans can expect an enjoyable experience in listening to this album, which is many things but definately not a bomb. <br /> <br />The standout tracks -- \\"All Because of You,\\" \\"City of Blinding Lights,\\" \\"Love and Peace or Else,\\" and \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\\" -- show that U2 is still fully capable of writing catchy tunes with substance, while the lesser songs reveal that even great artists are vulnerable to the bits of mediocrity that come with aging. <br /> <br />
1400031362|5.0|What a comforting and delightful series this is! Once again, the lead character, Precious Ramotswe, and her marvelous assistant, Mma. Makutsi, are set in motion uncoiling the moral and behavioral problems of their world, and they emerge from these difficulties with pearls of wisdom for all of us. Questions such as what is good behavior, what is beauty, and what makes people act the way they do are answered with a clarity and a certainty that ring true. One cannot but like Mmas Ramotswe and Makutsi and enjoy their internal ruminations on these eternal questions. Surrounding them are other well-wrought characters who struggle with life's challenges: Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni with depression, a  wild boy found in the bush who now needs to be civilized, a big Government man who comes to the detective agency with a familiy problem that really resides within himself, and on it goes. In the backdrop are the ever-changing cycles of nature as we are enriched with sensual and clear descriptions of the rich countryside that is Botswana. One comes away from this book in awe of its author's clear vision and wide knowledge. And somehow, after you turn the last page, you are comforted by all you have received from visiting this world.
6304698682|4.0|In \\"Pale Rider\\", director/leading man Clint Eastwood helps to resurrect the western with a tribute to two of the greatest in history, \\"Shane\\" and \\"High Noon\\".  Eastwood's character, \\"Preacher\\" rides into the lives of some gold miners who are being threatened by one of the largest mine owners in the West who wants to add their stake to his own.<br /><br />Just as Alan Ladd was in \\"Shane\\", Eastwood's \\"Preacher\\" is a larger than life character who's able to inspire the pan miners to stand up against the Lahoud family and their dozens of men.  Even when Lahoud calls for back-up in the form of a mercenary sheriff (John Russell) and his six deputies, the \\"Preacher\\" stands tall.  The body count ends up almost as high as a Sam Peckinpaugh western but without the slow motion death scenes and jets of blood.  I don't have to go into much more detail about the plot because most viewers will figure out the ultimate ending long before the film is halfway completed.<br /><br />Fans of the Eastwood style of Western (\\"Hang 'Em High\\", \\"Unforgiven\\", and all of the spaghetti westerns, just to mention a few) will certainly like \\"Pale Rider\\".  It's action-filled and and has few \\"draggy\\" scenes.  The supporting cast is strong with Michael Moriarty, Carrie Snodgrass, Robert Dysart, Chris Penn and  classic western bad guy, John Russell all playing solid characters.  Even Richard Kiel (\\"Jaws\\" in the James Bond movies) is present and gets hit in the groin once again by a mega-star  (the other time was by Paul Newman's \\"Butch Cassidy\\").<br /><br />While the DVD is not loaded with much in the way of extras (limited to scene selection, cast & crew biographies, and a couple of trailers), it is a pretty good transfer and the sound quality and cinematography are outstanding.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED FOR ALL EASTWOOD AND WESTERN FANS!
B000000OUJ|5.0|[...] new cds.  \\"...the genius is nothing in comparision to this guy, this album shows what real hip-hop is all about...\\"  Pretty much self-explainatory.  [...] you got no clue, go back to your pop rap [...] and you saying he defines hip-hop.  He is a sold out commercial artist, producing radio hits.  On the other hand, The GZA's name really defines him - GENIUS.  This album is one of the greatest ever.  It's simply amazing, some of the illest beats you will ever here, with some of the tightest rapping and sick flow, plus tight LYRICS.  This album is really classic, i am addicted to it.  Best tracks are Investigative Reports, Shadowboxing (my favorite), Duel Of The Iron Mic, and Swordsmen, but every other song is a classic.  Get this if for some reason you haven't already.  This is hip-hop at its best.

Yeah this band is the revelation of the (second part of the) year 2004 with maybe a band called The 22-20's in a more 21 century blues rock style for them (infl. by the stones or the cream...etc). Kasabian are very european in their electronic approach and sound a little like kraftwerk or david Bowie(77-79era). But with a singer more in a Stone Roses,Oasis, Happy Mondays mode...but Primal Scream (XTRMNTR is a classic LP from 2000)...is probably the nearest of the Kasabian sound but Kasabian still have a  very unique vision of music...this is dangerous...this is real rock n'roll <br /> <br />i hope you've understand my average english <br />thanx

Never in my life have I encountered such a shallow character. <br /> <br />I don't understand the appeal of this book - the movie was cute, Hugh Grant does smarmy so well...  the book, although very readable and the diary-format is fun - is a complete waste of time and money. <br /> <br />Bridget shows you the classic teenaged way of dealing with your problems - drink and obsess.

0141439661|4.0|Sense and Sensibility is more than 200 years old.  The world was a dramatically different place in the early 1800s.  The culture was different, the language was different, the governments were different.  The entire state of mankind was completely different.<br /><br /> So the question is, does a 200 year old book still pack a punch in 2005?  Or has it become an archaic, dusty tome that alienates any reader with its unintelligable prose and mindless story?  The answer, I believe, is a little bit of both.<br /><br /> Clearly, the pre-Victorian writing style varies greatly from the Hemingway-esque brevity that is encountered so often in modern times.  Often, Austen's writing is confused and cluttered.  It can seem overly pedantic, trivial, and circumlocutious.  There are entire paragraphs that can, and should have been, omitted because they are utterly flippant and redundant.  The writing style was, for me, a barrier.<br /><br />The society in which the story unfolds; that is, the cultural background, is also quite distant from our own.  If anything, Sense and Sensibility is a study in history.  We see what life was like back then.  We hear it from a primary source.  And, for the most part, the petty pursuits of the luxurious upper-class, the countless balls and parties, and the mindless squabblings of money grubbing lords are fine.  The reader accepts it as part of the history.<br /><br />  The story itself is where the true beauty of the book is revealed.  The story is timeless.  It proves, refreshingly, that one does not need a massive war or wrenching poverty to create a good yarn.  Yes, Elinor and Marianne live ridiculously priveleged lives (and often complain about their \\"misfortune\\"), but we all can identify with the romantic aspects of the tale.  We can identify with the characters, the people, who inhabit Austen's world.  And the characters are, quite simply, incredibly colorful and richly created.  The characterization is where Austen shines.<br /><br />  Sothe main drawback to this story is its age.  If you can get past the age of the book or even enjoy it intellectually, you will uncover a gem of a novel.  Austen's subject (unlike her prose) does not alienate us at all.  Instead, it reacquaints us with the yearnings and struggles of love and friendship.  If you can slog through some of the more clunky passages, there is a lot of insight and beauty in this book, as well as a fairly good story.
0007172826|5.0|This gifted author weaves a mesmerizing tale around Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer's most famous painting, creating an incandescent and luminous work of her own. His painting is a simple, though enigmatic, portrait of a girl with a pearl earring, about which little is known. The author, however, a born storyteller, creates a living, breathing story around it, using a singular, first person narrative. Told in spare, elegant prose, the author leaps into literary renown with this book.<br /><br />The events in the book are viewed through the eyes of Griet, a sixteen year old Dutch girl, whose changed family circumstances force her into taking a position as a maid in the home of a renowned painter, the taciturn Johannes Vermeer. There, the painter resides with his tempestuous wife, Catharina, their brood of unruly children, his commanding and shrewd mother-in-law, Maria Thins, and their loyal housekeeper and cook, Tanneke. The author lovingly details seventeenth century life in the Dutch city of Delft. It is here that Griet's story unfolds.<br /><br />Sensitive and perceptive, Griet is attuned to the under currents in the Vermeer household and, at first, takes care not to draw attention to herself. Still, she, the daughter of a tile painter, is curious about Vermeer's artistry and is drawn to his work and his methods. Vermeer, sensing a kindred artistic spirit in Griet, draws her into his world of paint, color, light, and beauty, creating an intimacy of the spirit between the two.<br /><br />Still, Griet, a girl on the brink of becoming a woman, finds herself confused and breathlessly desiring more than she may have. Her longing for more than a communion of the spirit with Vermeer is palpable. It is, therefore, not surprising that the undercurrents in the Vermeer household should come bubbling to the surface and engulf Griet, much to her consternation.<br /><br />This is a stunning literary work that fully realizes the promise that the author showed in her debut novel, \\"The Virgin Blue\\". She is an author that understands the less is often more, and she makes every word count. Deliberate and spare, her prose is lyrical in its simplicity, weaving a tale that will keep the reader spellbound. This is historical fiction at its finest. Bravo!The Virgin Blue\\".

Idina Menzel's powerful, pure voice is truely fantastic, as well as Kristin Chenoweth's sweet, yet hilariously funny character's voice!! I listen to this CD daily, because I'm just so attatched to it, and I'm sure anyone else who has purchased this will feel the same!! I just wanted to promote this CD because it is truely amazing!!!
B00006RU5B|5.0|RATM's self titled debut catapulted the band into the forefront of 90s alternative rock scene.  Rage's next three albums however suffered from \\"less of the same thing\\" syndrome.  Less because they do not feature any extended 8 minute+ songs.  It is in \\"Take the Power Back\\" and \\"Wake Up,\\" where we find innovative guitar solos and unforgettable epic jamming.  This brings us to the \\"same thing\\" part of the problem.  Without change of tempo in the middle, Rage songs just get lumped together.  They are repetitive and, dare I say, boring! <br /> <br />Enter Chris Cornell.  In addition to his commanding vocal and muscianship, Chris possesses diverse musical influences.  It shows in the new band.  Sure, Audioslave features standard RATM power singles \\"Cochise,\\" Light My Way,\\" and etc.  What is astonishing is some of the slower tracks and breathtaking ballads.  RATM plays ballads?  Who could have thought it?  To top that off, Tom Morello plays some amazing blues guitar on the last two tracks!  It is as if RATM boys have received a new blood transfusion.  It is not rap metal anymore.  It is music.
B00005JMCN|4.0|Adapted from the novel with the same title, Seabiscuit is a movie dealing with soul searching, ventures, and hopes in life. Not only is it another movie promoting courage and human tenacity, the historical setting of the Great Depression vitalizes the three male protagonists whose destinies were linked by coincidence.    Charles Howard, played by Jeff Bridges, was a successful entrepreneur who hit the goldmine with the automobiles he developed by chance. However, things went upside down when the Great Depression caused the collapse of his enterprise, his only son killed by his very own automobile, and his wife's subsequent leave. On the other hand, Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) was a veteran horse trainer who became underappreciated and isolated after the depression. Red Pollard, played by Tobey Maguire, was abandoned by his parents at young and struggled to support himself both on a horse race course and a boxing ring, ending up black and blue.    The three miserable men met and stake their ambitions on horse racing. After tying the knots with his second wife, Howard returned to his aspiring self and decided to venture on horse racing. He later recruited Smith and together they found Seabiscuit, a small horse whom Smith believed to possess unlimited potential. Pollard happened to be the only person who could placate Seabiscuit's wild temper and consequently he became the jockey. Together Seabiscuit and Pollard conquered most competitors in a number of races. However, awful truths were revealed and later other accidents occurred, so they had much more to overcome...    While the plot may be another clich aimed to inspire people, the narration throughout the movie remains entertaining and the acting is superb. The little horse was expertly trained and really makes viewers believe that it has lived the story. In addition, the movie's 141-minute running time enables it to insert depth which prevents it from falling in the foul category of inane comedies.    To stand up again after numerous times of stumbles is the key to American spirit, and this movie really epitomizes the refusal of conceding. Although such optimism appears unrealistic at times, it is what people like to believe. Thus, the movie is truly an excellent piece of wish fulfillment, showing that everything is possible.
0684800713|5.0|Hemingway got the Nobel Prize for a later inferior novel, The Old Man and the Sea.  This is unfortunate because Hemingway's best books were written early in his career, from about 1924 to 1940.  I feel that his most complete vision was achieved in For Whom the Bell Tolls, which is a large book with all of Hemingway's ideas, interspersed with a thrilling plot.  If I had a second choice, I'd vote for Sun Also Rises. Obviously the famous Hemingway style derived from Gertrude Stein and journalism.  Then he wrote about Post-WW1 cynicism and a love  gone awry.  The famous Lost Generation mops up Parisian wine and European despair with vigor.    The villain is Cohn the Jew.  I have some reservations here of course.  I feel the same way about Shakespeare's Shylock, but putting historical prejudices aside, Cohn personifies what is not cool about intellectual society in the Twenties.  Cohn doesn't get Paris, bullfighting, or fishing.  He's a great boxer, but does not box for the right reasons.  Don't worry, Hem will explain what are the right reasons.  Worst of all, Cohn doesn't get the sexual revolution.  An \\"affair of the lady\\" has certain considerations to uphold, but in the aftermath of his liaison with Lady Ashley, the flapper vamp, Cohn hangs around like a pathetic puppy longing for bitch's milk.      Barnes, the Hemingway surrogate has a problem.  He's had a war accident and has lost essential male equipment, which makes it impossible for Lady Ashley and Hem, er Barnes to consummate a raging desire and love.  Hence, the seething irony of Sun Also Rises, the uncool Cohn is able to perform while the very cool Barnes can only watch bulls being killed beautifully.  \\"Wouldn't it be pretty?\\"
B00064YTMU|4.0|This is a fast-paced, clever thriller that focuses on two men, a contract killer named Vincent, effectively played by a gray-haired and grizzled Ton Cruise, and an everyman, a cabdriver with a dream named Max,  played with appropriate resignation, intelligence, and angst by Jamie Foxx. When Vincent gets into Max's cab, neither of their lives will ever be the same.<br /><br />Max's night starts off auspiciously enough, when he drives a pretty federal prosecutor named Annie to her office, and, since they hit it off,  she gives Max her card. Unfortunately for Max, Vincent, a former special forces guy turned contract killer, is his next fare.  Vincent, claiming that he is some sort of out-of-town real estate entrepreneur, hires Max to chauffer him around for the night. Vincent explains to Max that he needs to make five quick stops, and for this he will pay Vincent six hundred dollars. Of course, unbeknownst to Max, each of those quick stops is scheduled so that Vincent can dispatch someone to the great beyond.<br /><br />By a twist of fate, the first stop goes wrong, when the contracted kill flies out the window and lands dead as a door nail on top of Max's taxi. The cat is out of the bag, as Max quickly discerns that Vincent is up to no good. Unfortunately, there is little Max can do about it other than to drive on with Vincent. Through their driving around together and their ensuing conversation, a moody character study of these two men develops. Of course, there is also a great deal of action whenever they are out of the cab.<br /><br />While some of the moments in the film are seemingly incredible, if the viewer suspends disbelief and goes with the flow, all will be well. Under Michael Mann's deft direction, the film stays taut and sharp,  with Cruise and Foxx both turning in excellent performances. Foxx can definitely run with the big boys. The supporting cast, Mark Rufalo as Fanning, a member of LAPD who suspects what is going on, and Jada Pinkett Smith as Annie, the federal prosecutor, also do their bit to contribute to the tension and action throughout the film.  Overall, this is an intriguing and compelling action thriller that will keep the viewer riveted to the screen.the federal prosecutor, also do their bit to contribute to the tension and action throughout the film.

B00065EB2M|5.0|The complete footage of Apollo 17. Some 27 hours of raw material. Great for hardcore space buffs, space historians, Apollo freaks and the like, but likely very boring for the casually interested. No commentary, no music, no mounting... just the raw footage.<br /><br />The packaging is ok, but as the reviewer before me already mentioned: there's a big chance that your dvds will arrive in a slightly damaged state (i.e. scratches) because they get loose during transport. My package was also broken and 4 dvds were damaged (but still playable, luckily). So, beware for this.<br /><br />Anyhow, a big Compliment to Spacecraft Films for making this all happen!
B00005JN7O|4.0|Watching this movie is like eating jell-o jigglers.  Fascinating to look at, but very little susbstances inside.  That's OK.  Sci-fi and action films are supposed to be attractive on screen, then worry about plot, logic, and solid steady direction.  A great deal of effort went into this film and it is very enjoyable as pure escapist entertainment, popcorn jewelry and nothing more.  The special effects are fantastic!  Revolutionary!  Mind Bending!  That's really all you need in sci-fi action.
B00008GKEG|5.0|This collection is a masterpiece.  What can I say that hasn't already been said?  I would pay a little more and get a DVD set.... The extra DVD, with the release of Real Love is well worth an extra $15 or $20.  I watched this on tv when it first came out, and I rented the tapes a few years back, but decided to buy the DVD disc..... So glad I did.  If your a Beatles fan, this collection is a must.  Several people have complained about sound drop and grainy pictures........ They must have been taking about some other set, as the video and audio are great - Of course, a film clip 40 years old, or a super 8 home movie will never be 100% clear and crisp, but you can tell a lot of work has gone on here and it pays off!
B000069I5U|4.0|This is a light-hearted buddy movie that is thoroughly enjoyable. Pairing up two greats, Robert De NIro and Eddie Murphy, was pure casting genius, as they generate great chemistry together, making the film an action-comedy worth seeing.  Robert De Niro does a great job as straight man for Eddie Murphy.<br /><br />Robert De Niro plays the role of LAPD Detective Mitch Preston, a hard-boiled, no nonsense flatfoot, who knows the streets and knows how to do his job. Eddie Murphy plays the role of Officer Trey Sellars, a patrolman who also moonlights as a would be actor, talentless though he may be, as he would rather play a cop than be a cop.<br /><br />Rene Russo, as gorgeous as ever, plays the role of television executive, Chase Renzi, who needs a hit show. She wants to do a cop reality show, and due to circumstances that present themselves, Detective Mitch Preston and Officer Trey Sellars have been tagged to foot that bill. Forced to work together, followed by television camera crews, the two become instant celebrities, much to Detective Preston's chagrin and Officer Sellars' delight.<br /><br />William Shatner is in the film, playing himself as the actor who played cop T.J. Hooker on a television series of the same name. Shatner is up to snuff and very funny. Look for Alex Borstein of Mad TV fame in the small role of the casting director.  Look also for Johnnie Cochran in a cameo role.<br /><br />Taken at face value, this is an action-comedy, buddy movie  that is quite enjoyable.
B00028HBKM|1.0|Christ is to Adult...as Santa Claus is to Child. What kind of sick mind would let their kid watch this pornographic trash? The kind of person who thinks \\"Jesus\\" is going to \\"come back\\". The type of person who believes MILLIONS are going to \\"HELL\\", if they are \\"unsaved\\". The fact that this MYTH of Jesus and the Bible continues to hold sway the world over is nauseating. This religious nonsense has gone on long enough. Throw this sick fantasy away and instead use common sense.
B00007BKVC|5.0|Before this movie I really hated Geena Davis.  I thought she was a whinny washed-up sitcom actress with no talent.  Sorry, Geena, I do love ya now, and I was so wrong.  This is one great buddy film, and not just for women.  These two characters are great.  They are full characters and real women.  Susan Sarandon should have won for this role.  It was a very complex character and not everyone could have pulled it off.  Again, the director is Ridley Scott.  He is a master.  Whether he is filming his leading ladies or the background, he makes sure that the scenery is always beautiful.  Look for a very young Brad Pitt in a small but important role.  You can see why he became a star from this role.
B000001E8S|5.0|They wanted so desperately to call it a U2 album that they deemed it a failure. Or, at best, a partial success. <br /> <br />Passengers was a group made up of the members of U2, along with Brian Eno and whoever else this collective could drag along. Other members included Howie B and Luciano Pavorotti, for what it's worth... <br /> <br />Listen. \\"Original Soundtracks 1\\" wasn't meant to be a U2 album, nor an Eno album. It was instead the rather fruitful result of a collaborative effort between five men and a few guests. Brian Eno hatched the idea as a series of soundtrack pieces for films that don't actually exist; although one or two of the created works ended up in real films, the rest were based on purely fictional descriptions Eno created for the band to work backwards from. <br /> <br />Of the few that found their way into actual cinema, \\"Miss Sarajevo\\" is the most immediately affecting. The first time I heard this track, I was weirded out by the Pavorotti part, but with each subsequent listen, I've not only grown to love it, but I have realized how beautiful a contribution that vocal part was. It's been known to reduce me to tears every now and again. <br /> <br />Anyway, you can tell which songs are for fake movies by reading the liner notes. Eno has used anagrams to encode the names of all involved in the recording of a particular track. <br /> <br />All in all, this album is brilliant if you're not expecting a conventional U2 (or even Eno) album. If you can avoid the connotations each artist brings to the table, you'll most assuredly enjoy this album's sublime attention to detail.
B00005JM4Z|2.0|John Singleton, best known for urban dramas like \\"Boyz N The Hood\\" and \\"Poetic Justice\\", takes some time off to pay the bills with a commerical property, a sequel to \\"The Fast And The Furious\\", 2001's big dumb adrenaline-filled car chase movie starring Vin Diesel. Vin's out of the picture in this one and vanilla-white Paul Walker is stuck carrying the bag with a supporting cast that includes R&B singer Tyrese (who made his film debut in Singleton's last movie, \\"Baby Boy\\") and the beautiful Eva Mendez. Also involved is rapper Ludacris who helps Singleton keep up his \\"rapper-per-movie quota\\".<br /><br />Walker's renegade cop Brian O'Connor is back and this time, he's paired with his estranged childhood friend (played by Tyrese) so that they can infiltrate a Miami kingpin's organization. (Don't ask me. I didn't write it.) Walker, who if not for Keanu Reeves, would probably be the least charismatic leading man in cinema history, is still able to blend in as a criminal henchman despite the fact that he looks about as menacing as the cast of \\"Leave It To Beaver\\". Tyrese, who seems to forgive and forget his estranged buddy sending him to prison in record time does a decent job overall but it doesn't do much to save this one from being a mess.<br /><br />\\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\" is a dissapointing sequel to a movie that was for the most part, an overrated full-length car commercial disgusied as a movie. While the original at least had its share of entertaining moments despite its juvenile plot and cardboard characters, this sequel doesn't seem to have such luck. Singleton, who still remains one of my favorite directors despite his involvement in this atrosity, should have known better than to take on this one.
B0006399FS|1.0|The Same Identity: An overexposed artist aging badly.  U2 have achieved cult status among world's music, but now they're turned down major international music company offers, as Elvis did by 70's.    This album is just full of clichs and Pop Stars sunglasses. How To Dismantle whatever is plenty of tricks and treats. The \\"new\\" video All Because Of You says it all: A joke of themselves. They still think they're playing Where The Streets Have No Name at the rooftop. Tragic.    Avoiding the hype altogether, \\"How To sell propaganda and iPod\\" is certainly an ominous omen for the band's fortunes. The record is the group's weakest effort in two decades.   Scheme is the same: whole chunks must be copied but hidding that evident lack of creativity by marketing the failed album as \\"instant classic\\", \\"return to their roots\\", etc. That's enough to sell millions, after all they're \\"U2\\". At least that's what they want us to think.     They pretend to be U2, but they aren't U2 anymore. They are a portrait of their artistic decadence.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This had to be the best music that I have listened to in a long time. The original cast has amazing voices and am so glad that I spent the money to buy it. The music is a combination of pop and showtune and the combination is perfect. If you like either Idina Menzel or Kristen Chenoweth's voices then this music will blow you away. <br />I listen to it at least 2 times a day!

This problem haunts \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" as well.<br /><br />You likely know the big hits \\"Candle in the Wind\\", \\"Bennie and the Jets\\",and \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\". Classic rock listeners will have heard album tracks \\"Funeral for a Friend (Love Lies Bleeding)\\" and \\"All the Girls Love Alice\\".<br /><br />In between those tracks lie some unsung gems but quite a bit of filler, too.

B0000AQS6R|4.0|Clark Griswold is planning the perfect \\"family Christmas\\" but just like previous \\"Vacation\\" films, things don't seem to go as planned. From an unexpected visit from his cousin-in-law Eddie (Randy Quaid in a show-stealing performance) to an overpacked (and over-lit) house, there seems to be problems at every corner for the Griswold clan. If you're looking for a hilarious Christmas movie, this is one of the very best that there is. This \\"Special Edition\\" is a bit light on bonus features. There is an audio commentary with the cast and crew (no Chevy Chase or Juliette Lewis though) and the original trailer. Even if the DVD isn't jam-packed, you can't go wrong in picking up this holiday classic.
6305537321|5.0|Perhaps the first and finest love story on the post-WWII era.  During the war it was Casablanca, before the war it was Gone With the Wind, and BAT captures the exactly right tone and tenor of New York in the post war era when it was on the verge of becoming the Athens of the 20th Century.  Yes, Mickey Rooney's portrayal is a discrace but the fact that Holly is a hooker only adds to the charm in my eyes.  Actually, this film was very risque for 1961.  A \\"kept\\" man, and hooker who was born a hillbilly named Lulu, and narcotics subplot, and just about every plot turn copied in every love story since.  The theme song is still haunting and appropriate which stays with you for days to come.  In fact, the entire film stays with you for awhile after viewing.  A real feel good movie about lovers which should be watched by lovers.  Viewing alone is not recommended.
0671578278|5.0|Simply the best book I have read in years; perhaps the best I've ever read. LMB writes so elegantly (yes - in a Science Fiction book no less!)and her characters are wonderfully human and funny. I discovered A Civil Campaign by accident and was immediately hooked. I've laughed until tears streamed down my face even on the umpteenth reading of the dinner party sequence and the Ivan/Donna/Dono scenario. Mile's courtship of Ekaterin, planned like one of his military campaigns, is a gem from his first nervous visit, through many ups and downs (that marvellous \\"abject\\" letter), to the final page. As Miles would say \\"No battle plan survives the first encounter with the enemy\\" and this battle plan goes awry in so many hilarious ways. Read this book (and all of her others) and enjoy!
0446677450|4.0|The idea I liked about this book is that it differentiates the traditional idea of the American dream, that you should go to school and get a good education and get a good job, from the alternative, which is that you should try to find other ways to make money, and then it gives some general guidelines on how to do just that. It doesn't give specifics, I guess because there are a million ways to make money in a free-market economy. If it had given specifics I would suspect that it is tied to a specific scheme that someone is making money selling. <br /> <br />I've read another book in the series, \\"Tax loopholes for the Rich\\" which also is not an easy, take-you-by-the-hand\\" plan. It demands that you follow a comprehensive, hands-on formula for developing a general, overall business plan for your activities. <br /> <br />So I don't think this series of books is just about making money for the author(s), but also gives useful information.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Christopher Nolan's \\"Memento\\" is one of the landmark films of the new century.  The film is distinguished by powerhouse storytelling, snappy editing, and great acting.  The basic story concerns Leonard(Guy Pearce) a man suffering from short-term memory loss who is attempting to unravel the mystery of his wife's murder.  Leonard's efforts include a network of body tattoos, Polaroid pictures, and handwritten notes he leaves for himself.  As Leonard attempts to piece together the mystery the question arises as to the reliability of these reminders.  Leonard's condition also subjects him to the exploitation from some malevolent forces.  Pearce gives an extraordinary performance as Leonard and is ably supported by Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss, characters whose motives in \\"helping\\" Leonard could come under suspicion.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|This is a good action flick with excellent casting, cool special effects and great costumes.  If you are looking for the Iliad, it's not here. The 10 year Trojan war is compressed into a few days. Achilles & Patrocles are cousins instead of lovers, Paris kills Achilles with a volley of arrows instead of just one, Cassandra is not in the movie, etc...  I really liked the way Achilles fights, but they used the wrong actor to pull it off. The made for TV movies The Odyssey and Helen of Troy are closer to Homer, if you are interested. <br /> <br />This DVD is worth adding to your collection.
B0000X61UU|5.0|I've never worked out before, because I never felt like I worked hard at the end. Not even with Tae-Bo!! I saw this video in a video store where I live, and thought I'd give it a try. I was NOT disappointed! I was so sore the next day! I loved it! Not only did I see immediate results in the change of my body, but my self esteem definitely was lifted as well. After awhile, it became more important to work out for the benefit of being healthy, rather than trying to have Cindy's great body haha! I have recommended this tape to all of my friends. I also went out and bought the first tape, and was equally impressed and amazed at the results.
B00001IVOR|3.0|Man, when I heard Reunited and the two tracks after back in 97, I thought, man, this is gonna be good.  Then everysong after that except As High As Wu Tang get and It's Yours totally blew.  So I thought, well, at least theres a second disc to enjoy, especially since Triumph is in it.  Man, triumph got me going, but man, half the songs between that and song 14 with Cappadonna blew.  But at least the other half was worth the listen.  Then the shampoo song came on and I was like what the ****?  Try copying it from someone else if you can or just listen to everyone elses advice about burning it, but hey, if your a big enough Wu fan, theres enough good songs, since theres a lot of songs period, to buy this.  So, go ahead and decide what you want to do, but it's definitely not 36 chambers.
B00005O3VC|5.0|\\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" is a landmark of screen comedy.  It is easy to equate this brilliant Medieval tomfoolery with something that preceded it but this film is a true original.  The film is an intricately plotted series of comic setpieces that mocks the Arthurian legend with equal amounts of silliness and informed intelligence.  Thirty years on this film has lost none of it's comic luster.  I have numerous favorite moments but that would ruin it for the uninitiated.  I was fortunate to have seen this film when I was a teenager theatrically back in the day when the Pythons brand of madness was just breaking on these shores.  This package includes alot of good extras including commentaries by the surviving Pythons(R.I.P. Graham Chapman) and the \\"Lego\\" version of the film.
B0002858YS|5.0|OK, I apologize for the bad pun. But if you haven't heard the Killers yet, you don't know what you're missing out on. They're an interesting blend of alternative rock/indie/synth and they are simply fantastic. Brandon Flowers, the lead singer, rocks on the synthesizer, lending the songs some really cool music. Here's a breakdown of the songs: <br /> <br />1. Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine - 5/5. A great way to open the album, even if the song is about a guy who killed his girlfriend. Love the music. One of my favorite songs. <br />2. Mr. Brightside - 5/5. This was the song that got me hooked on the Killers and is my favorite on the album. The lyrics are very real and the music is great. <br />3. Smile Like You Mean It - 5/5. Another great song. Though not as good as the previous two, I'd still give it 5/5. <br />4. Somebody Told Me - 5/5. Great single about a guy who suspects his girlfriend is not quite what she seems to be.  <br />5. All These Things I've Done - 3/5. The song is good until \\"I've got soul, but I'm not a soldier\\". I'm sorry, the gospel choir just ruined it for me. <br />6. Andy, You're a Star - 4/5. Good song with a cool beat. <br />7. On Top - Another good song. <br />8. Change Your Mind - 4/5. Yet another good song, but nothing incredible. <br />9. Believe Me Natalie - 4/5. Sensing a pattern here...it's a good song. <br />10. Midnight Show - 4.5/5. I really like this song. <br />11. Everything Will Be Alright - 3/5. OK song, they could have picked a better closing song.  <br /> <br />All things considered, this album is amazing, if not just for the first four songs, which are, in my opinion, the clearly superior tracks. A couple of filler songs, but overall definitely worth the money.
B000002H2H|5.0|How Metallica went from writing heavy metal masterpieces like \\"Creeping Death\\" to churning out boneheaded Southern boogie-rock like \\"Whiskey in the Jar-o\\" I will never understand. It's said that all good things must end. Well, in Metallica's case, that proved all too correct, as their kick-ass heavy metal did indeed die a slow, painful death in the 1990s. Nowadays, Metallica's music is so lame, so cheesy, and so awful that I wish they would change their name - they are nowhere near the heavy-metal gods of the 1980s, and no longer deserve a name that was once respected the world over. Listening to their music of yesteryear is a joy, but at the same time it's depressing to think of how much this once-great band has gone down the crapper.    But at least they made 5 exceptionally good albums before their implosion. And make no mistake - these albums are KICK-ASS. Ride the Lightning is right up there with And Justice For All and Master of Puppets, and when you compare favorably with juggernauts like those, you know you're in for some incredible stuff. And incredible it is. Bands like these do not exist anymore. The passion, the towering, monstrous riffs, the masterful solos, the ingenious songwriting, the pounding, thundering drums, the powerful, primal screams of James Hetfield...all relics of an age gone by. Don't bother trying to find bands like 1980s Metallica nowadays - there are none. To understand what I mean, you'll just have to listen to Ride the Lightning yourself. Prepare to crank the volume. Prepare to bang your head. Prepare to be blown away.     Fight Fire with Fire - After a brief classical guitar intro, the opening track explodes into a heavy, rampaging monster. A fast, ferocious headbanger, with Hetfield shouting the lyrics like a man possessed. The solo is absolutely superb, as is the breakneck drumming.    Ride the Lightning - This song is a classic, no question. It opens with a bang and never lets up. Slower than Fight Fire with Fire, but just as heavy and just as good. Great chorus, lyrics, and guitar, and another spectacular solo.     For Whom the Bell Tolls - A slower, more creative track, this song is another highlight. The guitars are exceptional throughout the entire song, Hetfield's lyrics and delivery are perfect, and the slow fade-out at the end is great.     Fade To Black - A haunting semi-ballad, and one of Metallica's best songs ever. Halfway through, the song changes tempo and becomes even more poignant. As usual, the guitars, drums, and vocals are top-notch. Classic.    Trapped Under Ice - Doesn't seem to be very well-liked, but I happen to like it a lot. Certainly not the best track off the disc, but a very good entry nevertheless. I love its fast, frantic, kick-ass drumming, and the riffs and vocals are great as well (love that echo in the chorus). The bridge and solo rock as well.     Escape - One of the shorter tracks on here, and probably the least memorable. The chorus is pretty good, but other than that nothing special. Still a pretty good track.    Creeping Death - One of the top songs on the album, if not the very best. A heavy metal band singing about a Biblical story sounds kind of dicey, but the song goes quite well with the subject matter (it's about Moses leading the Hebrews out of Egyptian slavery). The song sounds like a storm about to strike, and the bridge, chorus, and main riff give it a powerful edge. Great stuff.    The Call of Ktulu - A great closing instrumental.
B000002WPI|5.0|Man, this is the 2nd best hip hop album ever(behind Nas illmatic) Sorry WU fans.  This is the reason the Wu has such a cult following.  Even after over half of their original members are putting out crap nowadays.  EVERY, that's right, EVERY song is the best.  Not one or the other. I mean, it has a young mic hungry Method Man delivering one of the best lyrics ever on any hip hop song on Method Man.  CREAM is catchy, yet not trendy, and will have you chanting Cash Rules Everything Around Me, while noddin your head till your neck is sore.  Man, then you'll need to listen to Protect ya Kneck to do just that.  Man, I can go on and on.  13 tracks, is all they needed and it was an instant classic.  It was great for us hip hop hungry fans, but man, did it give these guys the fame they don't need now that the original members [...] nowadays except the rebel INS RZA& GZA. But get this. 2nd Best ever.  That's good enough for any hip hop fan to cop a cd.

B0000062FN|5.0|The first three Santana albums are approached in quality by the work that followed over the next thirty-plus years, but never surpassed.  Carlos' brilliant, thoughtful guitar work, along with the powerful keyboards and vocals of Gregg Rolie, and the greatest percussion section ever to hit the rock and roll airwaves and it's hard to beat.  The first Sanatana album, simply \\"Santana\\" with Jingo, Soul Sacrifice, etc., introduced us to a raw new sound, improved it with Abraxas, and perfected it with Santana 3.  As musicians, they reined in their extended solos and intensified what was left on each and every song.  The addition of Neal Schon as a second guitarist complimented and challanged Carlos to even greater heights.  The songs that get all the airplay were \\"No One to Depend On' and \\"Everybody's Everything\\", but for my money, the favorites are \\"Jungle Strut\\" and \\"Toussaint Le'Overture\\".  There is a consistant powerful groove on this album that he and his future bands haven't quite gotten to (yet - I hope).  For anybody that got on the Santana bandwagon with Supernatural and Shaman, you owe it to yourself to check this one out.  It really deserves the top spot on the Santana mantle-piece.
B000006ZDQ|5.0|On this Remastered cd contains A Great musical offering from Black Sabbath. The groups only cd with Dio, Iommi, Butler and Ward. This effort is deserving of a 5 star rating. All Classic Material on this cd.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|First off, I must respond to the other reviewers... this album IS metal.  Saying it isn't leads people to believe that there is NOTHING but the orchestra on here, and that's simply not true.  The guitars are actually supported by the orchestra in this one... they work together better than on Century Child, despite actually being heavier. <br /> <br />I'll now proceed to give my two cents on each track. <br /> <br />Dark Chest of Wonders- 9/10  The track itself is a superb opening for the album, with hard guitars and the choir... but Tarja's spoken intro makes me cringe every time. <br /> <br />Wish I Had An Angel- 10/10  I admit that it's radio ready, but that's not a bad thing... Marco and Tarja's chorus duet makes this song a memory. <br /> <br />Nemo- 9/10- Couldn't quite give it 10, but this is a SOLID track, the first single, and the way Ocean Soul from Century Child should have sounded, in my opinion. <br /> <br />Planet Hell- 10/10 Welcome to the hard side, folks.  This is one of Nightwish's most crushing songs, with Marco doing his metal bit, Tarja showing off her operatic voice a bit more, and some massive guitar work.  If you've had a bad day...  :) <br /> <br />Creek Mary's Blood- 10/10 Rating for completely different reasons.  Native Americans deserve a great many more tributes like this.  Ballad.  That's all I can say... grab a tissue. <br /> <br />The Siren- 10/10 I haven't figured out what key/mode this thing is in, but for weird tonalities, you can't beat this thing.  Electric violin solo WILL give you chills, promise. <br /> <br />Dead Gardens- 8/10 A bit generic, although pleasant sounding.  This one might have done better on Century Child, or even Wishmaster.  For the record, I consider Century Child a stepping stone from Wishmaster to Once... it's the beginning of a new sound, and a great start, but not quite there YET. <br /> <br />Romanticide- 9/10 Excellent, but not as original as the others... really heavy guitars, and the customary referenceto the Dead Boy. <br /> <br />Ghost Love Score- 10/10 HE CAN WRITE FOR CLASSICAL INSTRUMENTS!  Let doubters repent, for this is the perfect song for a movie... where mediocrity won't be accepted. <br /> <br />Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan- 9/10 Just Tarja and Tuomas here, no guitar.  Their first song in Finnish, wonderfully done, except not enough variation.  Think \\"Forever Yours\\" with a bit more chords and about the same amount of melodic figures. <br /> <br />Higher Than Hope- 10/10 The second the chorus hits you, you are going to melt.  Very hard chorus, very soft verses, and for the first listen, do not be driving.  Wow. <br /> <br />White Night Fantasy- 6/10 Sorry, but this song shouldn't have been put on here.  Tarja sings on pitch, but really cheesy melody and such.  Not a fan, but since it's a bonus track, I leave the rating at 5 stars. <br /> <br />Live To Tell the Tale- 8/10 Sounds a bit like Dead Gardens to me, but more major key work, an awesome keyboard opening, and better singing than the previous track.  Heavy guitars for the closer, a good choice for last bonus song. <br /> <br />The video, btw, is a performance style video, and worth a watch.  I know this was long, but I didn't see any reviews giving a good run down on the tracks.  Enjoy!
078322933X|5.0|I saw this movie several years ago on USA and at first, wasn't interested with it's rather slow beginning but once Nicole (Witherspoon) started dating likable and seemingly all around good-guy David (Wahlberg), their obvious strong attraction seemed something that I just wanted to pay attention to. When David starts to come on strong to innocent Nicole, her father, an over protective and rather wealthy man, proclaims that he is too much of a secretive boyfriend to hold on to and after Nicole attempts to break up with him, that's when all hell breaks loose. <br /> <br />This is truly Wahlberg's break-out role. He perfectly portrays that of a sickingly psychotic killer (and in one dramatic scene, beats himself up to win over Nicole) and while, surprise surprise, Reese Witherspoon seems totally in love with him, you know there's something wrong. But you just can't help but watch it! <br /> <br />In the end, Walhberg and Witherspoon come to terms with their strange romance in a dramatic twist that the ignorant might have not seen coming. And while it's predictable plot might not immediately win you over, the superb acting will. Witherspoon and Wahlberg show all they've got in this film (in more than one ways)...their acting shines bright and while they are constantly the focus of attention, all the more better for the audience: the two keep the drama going, the suspense is riveting despite the obvious ending... A movie that opened up doors of all sorts for the main actors.
6305364648|4.0|Sure, Bruce Willis is my favorite actor in action movies, but there is something very special about True Lies.  This movie is simply brilliant, start to finish.  I have never seen a movie with a supporting cast that was so perfectly put together in my life.  Arnold is great, we all know that.  Jamie Lee Curtis was the perfect choice for the female lead.  What a brilliant job she does.  Tom Arnold?  Whoever cast him also deserves a medal.  He is brilliant and the best at keeping the comedy and one-liners coming.  Bill Paxton also turned out an unforgettable performance as the sleazy used car salesman.  Tia Carrere was great too.  This movie was perfect from start to finish.  My only complaint is, where are the extras?  They need more than a trailer to accompany this steller movie, like a featurette, behind the scenes look, how the stunts were done, interviews with the cast/crew.  Seeings how this is Arnolds best movie, and BY FAR the best thing that ever happened to the careers of Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Arnold, I would think they would be jumping at the chance to do new interviews for this release.  They should come out with a Special Collectors Edition of this DVD, because this movie is a modern day classic if there ever was one.
0385513755|4.0|Very well written and well paced, but poorly researched and rather contrived. Interesting, but essentially just a formulaic page turner.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Friggin incredible!!!  I was amazed.  One of the best CDs I've bought in years.  Not a bad tune on the whole thing.  A must have for anyone.  I have over 1200 cds in my personal collection, and I would have to say this is one of the best I own.  I'm sure the radio will overplay some of it, and it will get old.   But, even if it gets overplayed to death, this thing is a masterpiece.  Regardless of what genre you like, or what you think of Green Day's older music, this one's worth listening to.  I do not own any other Green Day cds, and have always been indifferent about their music.  I bought this one to see what all the fuss was about.  Now I can see why there's so much buzz around this cd.  I could go on for hours telling you how great it is, but that would be a waste of time.  My advice...give it a listen.  You won't be disappointed.
B0006399FS|1.0|once again were disappointed to find a pathetic excuse for what we knew as U2.     The opening track, \\"Vertigo,\\" which has been spinning on the radio for a while, is completely unlike the rest of the album. The tedious song is one of U2's worst. If people somehow claim to enjoy it, they're only reacting to its excessive play on the radio. It's got everything you want to hear on a radio hit: Bono in his signature croon that varies from the catchy choruses to the predictable rhyming verses, and The Edge starting with a choppy guitar leading into a more drawn out feeling that later descends into a boring repetitive solo. Clayton on bass and Mullen on drums could only be described as dull and uninspired at best.     Overall nothing really new has been created, but who knows you may love it. Which is all fine and well, the U2 fanbase is so huge and well-established, that U2 don't actually need to experiment too radically just at the moment.     Possibly the laziest album in the history of music. How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb is the biggest waste of time I can think of, boring as hell. And, that's your great, being relieved at U2 playing guitars again, 'comeback' album. Comeback to what, exactly? What's the point with this album ? who need it ?    U2 are stuck in a moment that they don't want to get out of    PS: Triple H \\"Roland of Gilead\\" (Derrry, Northern Ireland) so you better learn how to count in Spanish.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|do me and alot of other people a favor. stop calling your music rock. you can't sing for crap!! and i mean that. it's bad enough that you do sing and i have to listen to this crap but the one thing that really makes me sick is that you really think that you can compare yourself to someone like sid vicious!!!! you are NOT anything like sid or the sex pistols and never will be. Your not rock. your just another little hillary duff. no matter how hard you try. wow, sucks for you.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|This is an excellent CD that captures all of the emotions evoked in the movie, from the smiles evoked in \\"All you Need is Love,\\" the tears and heartache of \\"Both Sides now,\\" the hilarity  of \\"Wherever you will Go,\\" the energy of \\"jump,\\" the lusting and longing of Norah Jones' song, and the tenderness of the Love Actually theme (the specific scene it evokes for me is when Keira Knightly is watching her wedding video).      If you haven't seen the movie yet, what I just said (and my review's title) makes no sense to you, and I do recommend you watch the movie before purchasing this.  I am confused by reviews complaining of missing tracks - my version had everything (i think), including Billy Mack's song (it does grow on you after you see the movie!)     For those of you who enjoy singing, this is a great soundtrack for singing along to, and nerd that I am, a karaoke version of this album would be a wonderful thing.      Also, I never liked the Mariah Carey song, but I love it here - the context (and amazing voice) work wonders for it.     Kelly Clarkson totally proves why she won American Idol on the first song of the CD - the first few times I listened to the disc I didn't reference the song list, and I remember wondering who had this gorgeous, soulful, mature voice. You can't imagine my surprise when I saw that it was Kelly Clarkson - she sounds amazing.    Eva Cassidy's Songbird is probably my favorite track - it is absolutely brilliant and was a wonderful selection that prompted me to buy her album of the same name.  This song is truly a treasure.     I loved the two Maroon 5 songs on track 3 - they are both excellent, but I wish they hadn't cut the first one off.  I'm sure it's just a tease to entice you to purchase their album, but I wish they had awarded us the full benefit of the two songs.      This is truly one of my favorite CDs, it has a long shelf life, and it's a great addition to any collection.
B0002IVN9W|1.0|\\"Power Out\\" is nothing but a 5th rate New Order rip off with a Wayne Coyne wanna be on vocals. It's like they took the rhythm section of New Order's \\"Temptation\\" and the guitar work from \\"Age of Consent\\" and came up with this lame song...how unoriginal can you get?
B00003CXTG|2.0|... but I feel even dumber after watching this beautiful, but awful pudding of a movie. My ninth grade history teacher actually told us that this movie would be educational, but the only thing I learned after watching this movie is that the guy who starred in THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER has gained a little weight, Ben Affleck is an awful actor, Josh Hartnett will still be an awful actor even after he changes that stupid haircut of his, James King is pretty and that the evil Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor for two reasons: 1, for \\"oil,\\" which isn't ever explained, and 2, to destroy the romance between the two pilots and the Olive Oyl girl they fight over. <br /> <br />Oh and Cuba Gooding Jr. turns in another magnificent performance in his one recurring role in movies -- yelling like a goon into the camera.
0753506483|5.0|What a fun, exciting, informative, amazing and well written book this is. I am not the best reader and find it difficult to concentrate reading books but this one just took me away, I couldn't put it down. It's a great read from ballooning to business decisions to loosing his virginity this book will give you some great laughs and I definately shed a tear reading about his sale of Virgin Music. To read about his ballooning adventures was captivating and full of suspense even if you have no interest in this sport. What an amazing man Sir Richard is and it was wonderful to have an insight to his life from his early years and all the obsticles he has faced in business and money. This is absolutely positively a great read, not to be missed!
B00005JKED|4.0|I have to say I loved this film. Principally, because I empathised so much with Hawke's character that I spent at least the first hour of the film trying to make excuses for Washington's character's behaviour. Perhaps I am just slow or naive, but I genuinely could not decide whether Washington was good or evil or just human in this film until the last half hour or so, when it becomes very obvious. I was sitting there debating with myself; is that truly the only way to approach this? Is there no other? I study Criminology and as such, the film was fascinating. I make no pretence that it was a particularly deep or thought-provoking film, only that it did address issues that I am interested in.  <br />I fully admit that I am no expert on crime on the streets of L.A. and so I make no judgement about how realistic this film was, except to say that while probably overdramatised, the issues raised are extremely relevant and far more common that you might believe.
076790592X|5.0|It took just one day for me to read \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" - I just could not put it down!  The cover states \\"an old man, a young man, and life's greatest lesson\\", that is exactly what this book is about.  Morrie Schwartz was Mitch Albom's professor in college, and friend.  They had lost touch and 16 years later, while flipping thru the TV channels one night, Mitch catches an interview Ted Koppel is having with Morrie.  This causes Mitch to go visit his old professor.  After hugging and catching up a bit, Morrie, known fondly as \\"Coach\\" to Mitch, asks Mitch if he'd like to know what it's like to die...and their final class has begun.<br /><br />Morrie has Lou Gehrigs disease, (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), a progressive and ultimately fatal neuromuscular disease, and is now in a wheelchair fulltime.<br /><br />Mitch begins to visit Coach on Tuesdays.  On fourteen Tuesdays they would discuss life, its meanings, and what is important about living and dying.  As the disease progresses, Morrie begins to look at life uniquely and shares with Mitch that the thing he's learning most because of having this disease is \\"...how to give out love, and to let it come in.\\"  Each week they discuss profound things that are yet so simple.  They discuss the world, regrets, death, family, emotions, the fear of aging, forgiveness...and goodbye.  Morrie imparts such wisdoms as, \\"Everyone knows they're going to die, but nobody believes it.  If we did, we would do things differently.\\"  And, \\"Accept the past as past, without denying it or discarding it,\\" \\"Learn to forgive yourself and to forgive others ...\\"<br /><br />Thru dying, Morrie teaches Mitch how to live.<br /><br />This book is a treasure and should be read by Everybody!!  It teaches things that most people already know, but for some reason do not put into practice in everyday life.  This book teaches us to cherish everyone and everything, love and compassion for others is such an important part of life.  I plan to give this book as a gift to many people in my life.<br /><br />Mitch Albom is also the author of \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\", another wonderful book that should be part of every home's library.  If you like \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\", you will also enjoy \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven.\\"  I love both books, and I highly recommend them both!!!<br /><br />1smileycat :-)n my life.

B0002XDODU|5.0|I love this album. Rammstein experiments with different music than they have written before, and the results are amazing. Although I was just recently introduced to Rammstein's music, I have heard some of their older songs, and while those are good, these songs are, for the most part, better. <br /> <br />Reise, Reise 5/5 <br />Great song. I love the strings in the intro, and it gets even better once the guitars come in. This song has a great epic feel,as if in a storm at sea or something like that. <br /> <br />Mein Teil 3/5 <br />Some people love this song, but I personally think that this is the worst song on the album. The intro is awesome, especially the strings intro on the single version, but the rest of the song gets very very repetitive. The screaming part also lasts way too long. I don't think that screaming like that belongs in music. Plus, Till only actually sings one note throughout the whole song. <br /> <br />Dalai Lama 5/5 <br />This song is a bit boring when it starts, but it gets good. This is the longest song on the album, but it's worth the length. The chorus when the piano plays a descending arpeggio and then some creepy singing comes in is amazing. The lyrics are a great rendition of the poem \\"Erlkonig\\" by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, which is changed to fit the \\"travel\\" theme a bit more. I think this song fits the album cover art the best. <br /> <br />Keine Lust 4/5 <br />Good song all around. Interesting lyrics, but you wouldn't know exactly what they mean with the melody that plays. <br /> <br />Los 4/5 <br />I kinda like this song. Its guitars are catchy, and points to Rammstein for major experimentation with the country feel. Even though this definitely isn't their best song, it's quite interesting. <br /> <br />Amerika 5/5 <br />Haha. I like this song. The chorus is EXTREMELY catchy and the bridge part is really good. The music video is very funny, and possibly one of the best videos ever made. I love the little subtleties in the video, such as the parody of the moon hoax. <br /> <br />Moskau 4/5 <br />The lyrics are a bit strange, but the music itself is quite good. I like the addition of the female vocals, despite the fact that they sound a little like the annoying characters in some anime. The accordion part is nice, and the part when Till and the female vocalists chant together in Russian. This really makes the contrast in their voices evident. <br /> <br />Morgenstern 5/5 <br />Ohh man I love the choir in this song. The intro is great, and so is the chorus. The verses leave a bit to be desired, however. I had a flashback to \\"Du Hast\\" when I hear the \\"Du... Du Bist hassliech(or however you spell it)\\" part. <br /> <br />Stein Um Stein 4/5 <br />The slow parts of this song really get across the theme of very hard work. The chorus is pretty cool, and I especially like the part when till says \\"ramm.........STEIN!!!\\" The band's name is hidden in there! <br /> <br />Ohne Dich 12349875183749876123/10 <br />Oh man I love this song. It's really beautiful, and the video is amazing. I think that this is one of, if not THE, best songs Rammstein has ever recorded. The chorus is great, and I love the fact that Till sings the entire song, seeing how too much speaking can get boring when you don't know much German. I also like how, despite the powerchords in the guitar, the mood of the song is NEVER changed. <br /> <br />Amour 20/5 <br />Another great song by Rammstein. I like the love metaphors in the lyrics, and the music is great. The verses are a great offset to \\"Ohne Dich,\\" which makes it's spot very appropriate. Makes a good finale to the album.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Michael Moore released this film to make more money for himself.  If you want to see the truth, watch Celcius 41.11, which is available for free.  If Michael Moore was truly just trying to get his message out, why do you have to pay for it?  I watched Celcius 41.11 and the videos by the Swift Boat veterans because they were available for no cost.  They also told the truth.  Cable news is the only way to go.  Shame on CBS and people like Michael Moore that distort the truth for their own selfish gains.  I have not watched this movie because I will not pay to watch it and have Michael Moore profit from it.
B0002PUH2Y|5.0|I love finding CDs and artists like this. I was channel surfing the cable and decided to stop on MTV Espanol for awhile, mostly because a video with a very fine young Latina was on, what can I say...Later on, a video out of nowhere comes on from someone named \\"Bebe\\", the song was \\"Malo\\". Wow! Very intense performance, and after getting the CD, I can happily report it is all good. The sound quality of the CD is excellent, the performances are varied and interesting. I really can't recommend this CD highly enough. Hoping for more output from this artist in the future.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Everyone knows the story, what can one say after seeing this movie.  For those that saw it in the theater, you probably heard the silence at the end of the movie as everyone filed out. <br /> <br />Why this movie instead of trash like Last Temptation? or JC Superstar?  Because it follows the book and shows what He went through for us.  Is it anti-semetic?  No more or less than the Bible.  Christ was a jew and the jews condemned him.  Oh, and were there the race riots that were predicted?  Of course not. <br /> <br />This movie is in my collection and will serve as part of my family's Easter Tradition each Good Friday.
0385513755|5.0|This was the best book I have ever read. I have the special edition with pictures to help illustrate the story. The story keeps you guessing the entire time with constant unexpected twists. I could not put it down. The theme of the story itself really makes you think. It was highly recommended to me and now that I have read it I have to highly recommend it to others.
B0002F7I9Y|3.0|I loved the movie Ray and remembered all the great songs he wrote and sung in the movie.  Went out to buy this CD for a music buff and myself.  Felt it was a good CD to have because its Ray's last. But, must admit I've liked some of his other CD much better.  My absolute favorite on this CD is the song with BB King.  Once I heard them singing, the CD got \\"kicked up\\" a notch.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I saw The Passion Of The Christ in theaters twice - It was the most moving film I have ever seen.  From a completely cinematic viewpoint The Passion is one of the best films ever made.  The cinematography, makeup, acting, directing, sound, editing, piture, etc. are absolutely incredible.  This is a movie to encourage and strengthen Christians, and to be respected by critics and others for its uncompromising vision and power.  If you cannot appreciate the film for its Christian elements, you have to be able to appreciate it for its film quality.    Thinking about The Passion reminds me of a Jimmy Wayne song, where he sings about Jesus \\"Stretching His arms out, as far as they would go, nailed to the cross, for the whole world to know: I love you this much, and I'm waiting on you to make up your mind, do you love me too?  However long it takes, I'm never giving up, no matter what, becaues I love you this much!\\"    Jesus loves you!
B0000062GE|5.0|Stabbing Westward is one of those bands that emerged right around the time when Nine Inch Nails reached its height publicly with the Downward Spiral, it was 1994 and NIN knocked the world on its ass with that album, and it was in the same year that Stabbing Westward released their first album UnGod, which would be followed up by the classic Whither Blister Burn and Peel in 1996. skip forward a couple years and Darkest Days is released, seamlessly blending what made Stabbing Westward great in the first place, amazing lyrics, a dark and dreary mood and some of the lushest sounding effects distortion and guitars to come along in years. By no means is this album one the best ever made, but the production values and effort that went into this album exemplify what Stabbing Westward strives to achieve with their music as a whole. The whole album flows seamlessly together, working well to bring you into these Darkest of days, and peaking as S.W. best album ever. After this the band fell into pop-mediocracy which was unfortanate as this album is a true testament to 90's synth-rock. All of the songs are great with drugstore and waking up beside you probably coming in as my favorite tracks on this album. A great album that is definitely worth purchasing, and if you like this then I certainly hope you own a NIN album, if not then you might want to start there as NIN are really the pioneers of this type of music, and in my opinion have never put out a crappy album, ever. Pick up Whither Blister Burn and Peel too, a bit shorter and not as dark but still a great album and it has their two most notable radio songs what do I have to do and Shame.
B0000959N0|5.0|I was blown away by the director's cut of Daredevil! It's darker, better, and more engrossing. Daredevil The Director's Cut is a top notch film and one of the best DVDs I've ever purchased.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|Yeah, I signed up when I bought Season One, and reaffirmed my commitments and membership to The Gilmore Girls Craze when I bought season 2... <br /> <br />So, where did we leave off?  Rory finally told Dean that she loves him (I love you, you idiot... funny), and Lorelai had just gotten proposed to through 1,000 yellow lillies, or whatever the flower was...  It looks like a year of love for the Gilmore girls...  But that would be boring... <br /> <br />Returning this season are:  Lauren Graham (Lorelai Gilmore), Alexis Bledel (Rory Gilmore), Scott Patterson (Luke Danes), Keiko Agena (Lane Kim), Jared Padalecki (Dean), Kelly Bishop (Emily Gilmore), Edward Hermann (Richard Gilmore), Melissa McCarthy (Sookie St.James) and, Yanic Truesdale as Michel...  And let's welcome newcomer Milo Ventimiglia as the new bad boy nephew of Luke from New York, Jess... <br /> <br />Upon watching the first season, I didn't honestly believe that any season could trump it.  The dialogue in this wonderful drama is absolutely magnificent, and delivered perfectly by its incredible cast.  We are rarely left with any dull moments, because as things begin to get happier, something else happens to bring the crew down...  Here's what we get to look forward to: <br /> <br />1.  Rory's relationship with Dean...  It seemed like it would be a match made in heaven after Rory declared her love for Dean, until Jess came into town.  While Dean is caring, compassionate, considerate, and a little annoying at times, Jess seems like a breath of fresh air, as despite his attitudinal deficiencies, they seem to be more on the same plane...  The more important question is, will Rory and Dean be able to keep their flamed akindled, or will Jess steal her heart away... <br /> <br />2.  Lorelai...  Upon a self-revelation, she decides to break of the wedding with Max Medina last minute, as the girls take an impulsive trip to Harvard.  Boy trauma for Lorelai seems to keep to the down low, until Christopher booms in with news of a new girlfriend...  They seem serious too...  Then again, you never can tell, and on the heels of something magical blooming between Christopher and Lorelai, yet more obstacles get in the way... <br /> <br />3.  Richard and Emily.  We all knew that they fought quite a bit, after all, old people set in their ways, not to mention being kind of one-sided, including their absolute adoration of their granddaughter.  But Richard is a little on edge, as things occur between them that may cause problems later on...   <br /> <br />Let's not also forget to mention Luke's relationship with Jess, which makes for great fun a lot of times, Rory's ascent to her change in character, Sookie & Jackson, adventures in modeling, a huge village sized dinner party complete with horses and boyfriend controversy, newspaper extravaganzas, a luxurious spa visit, Richard in Stars Hollow, and talk of Lorelai and Sookies starting their own inn...   <br /> <br />This season is full of humor, joy, and tragedy.  It has its plethora of sad moments, and happy moments, and altogether times where you might feel tears beginning to shed from your eyes, not mention yet another cliffhanger ending as we dont' really know what to feel, or what will happen.   <br /> <br />Buy this...
044024157X|2.0|In this novel John Grisham has created an in depth and fascinating study of a small southern town and all its characters, tracking their growth and development over time.  He details food, customs, race relations and politics.  However, that is most definitely not what I wanted from a Grisham novel with a legal title.  I wanted suspense and thrill.  This dragged on with Michner-like detail providing occasional clues to the secondary legal plot while chronicling history.  The denoument was highly anticlimactic.  Read it for lovely historical fiction, but not if you want hardhitting, riveting thrilling suspense.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Not to be entirely anecdotal, but I was never a fan of Superman when I was a kid.  I didn't like the movies a hell of a lot, and Lois and Clark with Dean Cain, and Teri Hatcher just didn't do it for me.  Of course, I was a little kid, so, what would you expect? <br /> <br />I got turned onto Smallville from a friend just a short time ago.  All I knew about it was, it was about young teenage version of Superman, and there were \\"freaks\\" of the week, and that went against basically everything I like about primetime drama, because, I am a huge fan of season arcs...  Be that as it may, this ended up to be a great show. <br /> <br />But this show was clever.  It wasn't about Clark Kent speeding around bends showing off his alien power to save the weak.  He did that every episode, but it ends up being more of a side plot in a way, because we learn more and more about our characters, and we get to watch them grow every episode.  They try to make this as human as possible, while keeping the superman myths alive, which is what makes this show as successful and enjoyable as it is. <br /> <br />Clark Kent (Tom Welling), was dropped from the planet Krypton during a meteor shower, pretty much into the hands of Jonathan and Martha Kent (John Schneider and Annette O'Toole, respectively).  During this meteor strike, a little girl is orphaned (Lana Lang, later played by the exquisite Kristin Kreuk), and a little boy is struck bald (Lex Luthor, played incredibly by Michael Rosenbaum).  Aware of Clark's abilities, the Kents try to raise him as a normal human being, in spite of his abilities, attempting to keep them a secret from society, trying to avoid the notoreity from the rest of the world, which also makes for some interesting confrontations between Clark and his friends.  Add to the mix, a glorified school newspaper reporter, Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack), who's interest in the meteor rocks and the weird things that happen in Smallville causes her to be a great help to Clark, herbest friend, and unrequited love interest.  His best friend, Pete, is also there along the ride (Sam Jones III).   <br /> <br />Clark loves Lana, but never really has the gall to do anything about it, not only because of fear, but also because of her uber popular boyfriend star quarterback, Whitney (Eric Johnson), and the wonderful kryptonite necklace she wears as a memoire to her fallen parents.   <br /> <br />All-in-all, the main story arc pretty much of the whole series doesn't really come into full play until the final four or five episodes...  Most of these are \\"monster of the week\\" variety.  It is all very good TV though.  I suggest all of you go out to buy this, even if you don't like superhero mythos, or even teen romance.
1401200605|5.0|This book starts out simple enough, Killer Croc (A long-time foe of the Dark Knight) has kidnapped the son of some rich capitan of industry type, and Batman can't have that. Not in his city. But after saving the child, and defeating Croc, Batman realizes that Killer Croc was not the mastermind, and the kidnapping of the young man was only the tip of the iceberg in a plot to test the mental and physical limits of Gotham City's Dark Knight! This title (which is only the first of two volumes) is an excellent mystery which keeps you guesing as to who the real mastermind is. Writer Jeph Loeb, and artist Jim Lee have created the best saga in the mythology of Batman since Frank Miller's '80s classic \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\". The \\"HUSH\\" storyline features appearences by all of the best Bat-Villains, and is DEFINATELY a must have for any Batman fan, or any comic book fan at all for that matter. In one word........ CLASSIC!
B00006AW2M|4.0|This is the only Rolling Stones CD that I own. Why? Because 1) I love psychedelia, and 2) you don't hear any of this on the radio. It sounds different from all the other Stones albums, which you can sample on Classic Rock radio anytime. Thanks for reading.

0800141660|4.0|Jane Austen's \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is the tale of the 'second' Dashwood family:  a mother and three daughters who didn't inherit when the father passed away.  The heir swore a deathbed oath to take care of his his step-mother and step-sisters, but his wife, Fanny (I couldn't think of a more appropriate name myself!) talked him out of it at every turn.   <br /> <br />The second Dashwood family:  Mrs. Dashwood, the mother,  Miss Dashwood--aka Eleanor the eldest (Thompson), Marianne (Winslet), and Margaret, are forced to move to a country cottage and fend for themselves on the $500 a year stipend the estate grants them.  Of course, in the 1800's they cannot have a career.  Further, since they don't have any money for a dowry their matrimonial prospects are not very good, either.   <br /> <br />Along the way, Marianne learns some lessons about faith and devotion from Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman).  I'm a huge Rickman fan and this is one of his best performances.  You get used to him playing villanous roles and Colonel Brandon hardly seems like him.   <br /> <br />Eleanor also discovers Edward Farris (Hugh Grant).  I can't say the pair of them give the most spirited performance in the movie, but that's what their characters are about, too.   <br /> <br />Overall, beautifully filmed, costumed and acted.  \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is still my favorite Austen, but this one's a good close second.

B0000501C3|5.0|As a long-time fan of Lully's music, I was at first sceptical about music recorded for a movie soundtrack and had fairly low expectations.  However, I was extremely impressed by the richness of the recording and the power of the music in this compilation.  I would highly recommend it - it is now a personal favorite.
0316172324|5.0|It's remarkable to realize that this book represents the life work of many brilliant researchers, most of whom we would never know except for this book.  Malcolm Gladwell has taken decades and volumes of highly technical research and turned it into what will surely be a best seller.  He has made these concepts accessible to the average reader and anyone can see almost instantly how it applies to every day situations we all encounter.  It's beautifully written, succinct and crafted so as not to intimidate.<br /><br />I was riveted from start to finish.  I have been married and divorced twice now, yet I chose a stray dog at a pet adoption day in less than 5 minutes and was absolutely certain of the decision.  My dog is the most wonderful companion one could ask for.  This book explains how this can and does happen - even to those of us who consider ourselves educated, reasonable and experienced.  I would highly recommend it.
0316666343|2.0|wow, did this book get hyped to me. but it falls far short of the mark and it is, finally, exploitive of its horrendous subject matter. muddled and so not worth it.
B000002UA0|5.0|I've got something I can't explain.A simple explanation of this record is not possible.Wondering and dreaming, the words have different meaning.Turn out the lights , put on a set of headphones and let the music guide you.Seriously,the album has a sound and a style that are hypnotizing and really haven't been matched.Some people will lash out and write that this album lacks the sophistication and vibrant sound that defines the later albums of Pink Floyd(DSOM).I love the 70's Floyd as well.But Piper always has a special place in my CD collection.It embodied a time in rock history and is still chosen by a lot of magazines (Rolling Stone for one)as one of the greatest rock records ever.Considering the fact that I'm 38 and first listened to this record when I was in (get) High School in 1982 and thought the record was great.I still say Piper at The Gates of Dawn is one of their best.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I love this movie. This movie makes us realize how simple our life can be. <br /> <br />This movie is about a boy, but there are no video games, pizzas or junk food. <br />Only fancy thing you see in this movie is provably a time machine module.  <br /> <br />He doesn't have much, but he has more than most other kids do. He enjoys  <br />very rich life without obsessing with material things.  <br />He loves drawing illustrations, and he value friendship.  <br />Just a little thing makes him happy or sad. Just a little thing makes his day.  <br /> <br />This movie isn't for everyone.  <br />If your life is too simple, it's not movie for you.  <br />If you are obsessed with material things, it's not movie for you neither.  <br />If your life is fairly complicated and feel something is missing, this might be a movie for you.  <br /> <br />Lastly, I have a friend just like Napoleon, and he rocks. <br />
B0002EXH54|5.0|In my mind, this will always be the best Megadeth CD. I know that Megadeth had bigger commercial successes but to me...this is their finest hour. This album has Chris Poland on guitar and in my mind, this is the best Megadeth lineup. Poland's playing on this album is incredible. I love Marty Friedman and Rust In Peace is a favorite too but for me Megadeth's \\"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying\\" with Chris Poland is and always will be the quintessential Megadeth CD. I don't have the one with the remixes but I can see myself checking it out if I wear out this CD. Hell, this is such a great metal CD I might buy it again with the remixes for the hell of it. I'm sure there aren't a lot of people familiar with Chris Poland but he is an incredible guitar player. I recommend checking out his Return to Metropolis CD too.  <br /> <br />I'd say that the songs Wake up Dead, Peace Sells, Black Friday and My Last Words are my favorite tracks. How could you not like a song like Black Friday that starts out with this lyrical gem:   <br /> <br />\\"Killer, intruder, homicidal man. <br />If you see me coming, <br />Run fast as you can. <br />A blood thirsty demon <br />Who's stalking the street <br />I hack up my victims <br />Like pieces of meat.\\" <br /> <br />Yes sir, it don't get any better then that there!!!  And belive me...the lyrics just keep getting better...but check it out for yourself.  LOL <br /> <br /> <br />Wake Up Dead...great opening track...I love it when Dave sounds really pissed off.  <br />The Conjuring...good track...not my favorite but still a good listen.  <br />Peace Sells...the most known track on this album...I love the lead fills by Chris on this one.  <br />Devils Island...great song. <br />Good Mourning/Black Friday...one of my personal favorites on this CD...I memorized the lyrics when I was younger.  <br />Bad Omen...this song isn't among my fav's but it still kick azz. <br />I Ain't Superstitious...it's a old blues cover song but nothing like the original done by I think Howling Wolf...LOL, I thought this one worked great. <br />My Last Words...great lyrics about playing Russian Roulette...OK, I'm twisted but this CD isn't for the Britney Spears crowd.  <br /> <br />This is a must own if you like Megadeth. It's a hungry and pissed off Dave Mustaine. It's a great guitarist like Chris Poland on top of his game. The lyrics are great. The playing by the band is great. Get this CD !!!
B00009Z576|4.0|As many have noticed, this album is somewhat related to Relayer, it rocks like Yes had never done before! I mean, the \\"New Age\\" guys (Anderson and Wakeman, just check out their solo material, Yes seemed to be the group in which they would \\"rock out\\", but they never did much of that in solo) are out, the rockers are left, and they wisely brought in two of the New Wave masters (I mean, Buggles were much more interesting than The Police) to replace the forlorn. Many call this album dysmal, but it's actually Tormato and, to a lesser extent, Going for the one that were so, completely wrong albums for Yes at the time, insisting on New Age based rock in a punk era. Now, Drama could actually be seen as the first and superiour Asia album in many ways. Much less polished, though, it joins an avant-pop group on the pinnacle of their creative forces with rock's most solid rhythm section and Howe finally free to Rock It Out. Looking back, rock didn't get better than this in this period, it's the definitive New Wave album to me, and Yes' rockiest album, with an interesting futuristic concept that requires further analysis (Who is the Machine Messiah?). If you like New Wave style, check this out. If you like 80s Yes, see where it all started, when they were still progressive, and if you're a 70s Yes fan, open your eyes! Sure Heat of the moment (Asia) and 90125 were huge commercial sucesses, but the common seed was sown through this little known album.
B000008HZB|5.0|If you love the music of Jeff Lynne in ELO, you will LOVE this CD. I am a very picky fan of The Beatles and Jeff, and this CD has been a constant in my player since its release. \\"Blown Away\\" is a fantastic song, and sums up the \\"Armchair Theatre\\" experience for me...gawd, I love Jeffy....
B000002BSV|5.0|I love Suede and have heard many of their CD's, but I still maintain that this is them at their best.  All of the songs are fun, sometimes moody, rowdy, and glam to the max!  Brett Anderson's   powerful voice, the quirky lyrics, and the upbeat music just make you want to get up and dance around. <br /> <br />Suede often has the tendency to become a bit morose, but Coming Up has very few melancholy moments, just feel-good, head bopping tunes.  Some of the best songs on this CD are: Trash, Filmstar, Beautiful Ones, and The Chemistry Between Us.  I love the use of the string instruments that Suede is well known for.  On The Chemistry Between Us, it feels like a symphony is in your very own living room. <br /> <br />This is Britpop at its best, and I highly recommend indulging in it!
B000000HHE|5.0|This album that De La crafted really is a masterpiece, and one of Hiphop's all-time ultimate albums. De La Soul has been excellent at every stage in their career, with whatever approach they go into albums with, but nothing they've done is quite as fresh and perfect as this. These teenagers(at the time) spit so much knowledge and love in the most creative ways possible.  Every track, every skit, every sample is outstanding on \\"3 Ft. High and Rising,\\" even the 12\\" version of Plug Tunin', which is a harder, spare version with some different(I think even better) lyrics. This album is full of satisfying lyrics, hilarious and enlightening interludes, influential, avant-garde production, a nice variety of how the two MC's exchange verses, innocence, wisdom, significant metaphors, and perfectly placed DJ scratches. My favorite song is \\"Tread Water,\\" it's so creative. The skit, \\"Can You Keep A Secret\\" makes me chuckle every time. It displays such youthful humor that seems to be void in a majority of Hiphop. You gotta appreciate the commentary on \\"Ghetto Thang,\\" and \\"Eye Love\\" is one of the most sincere, believable love songs to ever come out of Hiphop. Some may not enjoy \\"De La Orgee\\" and the following \\"Buddy\\"(w/ Jungle Brothers and Q-Tip) so much, I know I didn't at first, but they still are entertaining and can be written off as silly young humor. There are plenty other gems on the album such as \\"Magic Number,\\" \\"Potholes In My Lawn,\\" \\"Say No Go,\\" \\"Plug Tunin'\\" the smash-hit \\"Me, Myself, and I,\\" and \\"This Is A Recording 4 L.I.F.E.\\" among other bright spots.  If you can, buy a couple of their later albums like \\"De La Soul Is Dead,\\" \\"Buhloone Mindstate,\\" or \\"Stakes Is High,\\" and enjoy them before purchasing this treat that is \\"3 Ft. High and Rising.\\" You should no doubt be convinced that this is their ultimate work, and the group really comes into focus on this album, and it should help you understand their other albums even better! You shall even realize that this album wasn't even that strange or weird, because you get to know the guys so well. \\"De La Soul Is Dead\\" is definitely the strange, and black sheep album out of the bunch. I remember downloading songs like \\"Me, Myself, and I\\" and \\"Potholes\\" way before I bought this album, and not liking them too much. Once I bought the album however, these songs really sounded good and it became clear why they're standouts on the disc. Despite all the ground-breaking, life-changing work that Posdnous(or Wonder Why), Dave(or Trugoy the Dove), and Maseo(or P.A. Pasemaster Mase) have done throughout their career, nothing will ever be as earth-shattering as this! You can't deny how essential Prince Paul was to this album as well. I was lucky and found this album for a steal at under $10 with a new bonus disc full of great unreleased songs, skits, and remixes. Believe the hype! This truly is the 'magic number.'
B000268QB2|5.0|Keane have made a grand debut with Hopes and Fears: a grand, sweeping piano-laden masterpiece.  You might think that the distinct lack of guitars would make for a tame, almost hollow song.  Well, that couldn't be further from the truth.  The songs on this CD are nothing short of amazing.  Chaplin's sensitive, emotional voice is balanced out with beautiful piano harmonies that you will find yourself humming all day.  There is also a hint of synthesized sounds for those listeners who like a more traditional approach to music. <br /> <br />Somewhere Only We Know is the most well known song and probably one of the most beautiful, but the rest are gems as well.  My personal favorites are This Is The Last Time, Everbody's Changing, and Bend and Break.   <br /> <br />I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this CD to anyone who liked Somewhere Only We Know when they heard it on the radio.  Give it a chance.  It is strangely calming and upbeat at the same time.
B00028HBKM|1.0|I cried when I saw The PASSION OF THE CHRIST - how could you not? I sat there and watched a man brutalized for two hours. Everyone around me was crying - it felt like we were all tuned in to the proceedings of a televised execution.  I was a little confused by the time it was all over & as I was leaving the theater, I was even more so: I saw parents walking out with their children.  Jesus Christ's teachings were left in the wings, the significance of his life locked out of the script almost entirely.  Hardly a first impression for young children.  The ONLY things I found at all interesting about the PASSION OF THE CHRIST: the use of the authentic languages from the time period (Latin & Aramaic) and the actors bringing this movie to life.  James Caviezel's performance in Terrence Malick's THE THIN RED LINE was simply mesmerizing, and he used a similar pallet of emotion for his performance here.  I was raised a Roman Catholic - so viewing the Stations of the Cross was nothing new to me.  To suggest this film version of that seasonal meditation is a \\"masterwork\\" - simply is absurd.    So what WAS the point of this film, what were we to draw from its brutal imagery?  There was no inspiration in Mel Gibson's film for me, no arc of understanding - only suffering and death.  Which led me to consider their goal may have been to create a vivid emotional experience, intended to lift us out of numbness and inspire reflection on faith to get us through this life: televised warfare, beheadings on the internet, stories of sickness and shootings on the nightly news, etc.  Perhaps, but I don't think so.  A fleeting, knee-jerk reaction with some tears shed on queue, and then those emotions are safely placed back on the shelf until the next time.  Complicity and silence have always gone hand in hand: it's easy to damn this world, condemn what we see as different from our own huddled beliefs; allow selfishness and insincerity to decimate through clouds of frankincense and joyous hymns.  Salvation?  Maybe.        The infamous THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST, directed by Martin Scorsese, is a \\"masterwork\\" of filmmaking. The film not only inspires the heart, but also prods the mind.  I could feel the breath of those images, allowing me to enter the world it created and truly feel something more than myself.  It was not an epiphany; it was a fresh view, it was an enlightened dream of another world, yet strangely our own.  The film didn't plague the audience with blood and horrors; it dramatizes the passion and relevance of the story.  I've come to understand and believe Jesus Christ to be among the greatest teachers this world has known, who suffered the tortures of the damned to inspire his vision of peace, determination for truth and humility in us all - ideals that have taken a back seat to robotic, indignant servitude to skewed \\"moral\\" interests.      The LAST TEMPTATION was based on the book by Nikos Kazantzakis - from which the filmmakers created a thoughtful, passionate re-examination of one of the greatest stories ever told.  Mr. Scorsese, in his youth, had almost joined the priesthood; but chose to explore and express his passion through the cinema.  I saw no blasphemy in his images - only a powerful film exploring faith in ourselves and the world.  Often cited as trash, garbage and against popular faith - this film truly offers a story of FAITH we can all profit from, regardless of what we believe.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|I'll be honest, I'm not an old school Enigma fan. In fact, I only started listening to Enigma recently. However, I personally feel that this is an excellent album. The only song on this album I dislike is Total Eclipse of the Moon!
B0006399FS|1.0|<br />They can't leave behind the full weight of their support. <br />This souvenir shows their recent musical ignorance and irrelevance.  <br />I cannot even remember 3 songs from such blatant corn. <br />U2's music splits up.
0060977493|2.0|I am a bit puzzled by the critical acclaim piled onto this book. It seems well written in some respects, but it is also needlessly complex in its verbage and its time/setting schemes (half the time you have no idea what time frame she's talking about, often for several pages). Moreover, none of the characters seems particularly compelling or relatable, which in retrospect, I think might be its fatal flaw. You've got a complex array of eccentric and bizarre characters, but they never seem to really come alive-- least of all the twins, who are the two main characters. And however rich the language of the book may be, it's hard to get past the fact that you don't \\"feel\\" these characters; it feels like elegant, but wasted, breath for the most part. However, there is a noticable, but modest, element of alluring beauty in her sentences and phrasing, but more often than not, I did not find myself particularly engrossed in the poetry (although, in its defense, I didn't hate the hell out of it, as I often do with books in which the author needlessly overdoes it; case in point, William Faulkner's \\"Light in August,\\" a book that bears more than a passing resemblance to this one).  <br /> <br />\\"God\\" is littered with the kind of writing that I suspect prize judges fawn over-- particularly the convoluted plotline that is easy to admire given its complexity and the apparent amount of time that was put into it-- but in my opinion it is not a very satisfying work for the reader in the \\"effort vs. reward\\" aspect; I didn't feel like I completely wasted my time, but I also wished I had spent this time on another, more rewarding piece of literature.  <br />
0670033375|2.0|This book is weird. Its main message is that the harvesting of timber is the greatest threat to the civilization and there may be similar serious environmental threats that decide about the fate of the societies. This thesis itself contradicts our very basic knowledge about the origins of the civilization. Ten thousand years ago or so, people began to replace the forests by fields and the first primitive forms of agriculture started. This development was completely necessary for our modern civilization to emerge. It was necessary for the appearance of intelligent life on Earth. Diamond does not appreciate this fact, and he even does not seem to realize that timber is a renewable resource. <br /> <br />You would expect that a book about the \\"societies that choose to fail or succeed\\" will focus on the great superpowers and civilizations that were the key players in the global history. You would expect that the book will cover the history of the civilizations of the ancient Iraq, the history of China under various dynasties, the Roman Empire, the Soviet Union, and others. But of course, the fate of the important civilizations does not confirm Diamond's assumptions. For example, the Soviet Union collapsed because its socialist economy was not strong enough to compete with the West in arm races. These are obviously not good arguments for Diamond's strange statements that identify the industry and the population growth as the primary sources of evil, while the climate change and environmental damage are the most important factors that should decide about our lives. <br /> <br />So which societies Diamond chooses to support his hardly defendable claims? An old community in Montana; Greenland; the culture on Easter Island; the Maya; the Anasazi. I have not heard about some of them, so I can't verify whether Diamond's presentation is fair. It's clear that the comparison of those civilizations with the present is ludicrous - but I think that his cherry-picking of the examplesmakes his conclusions unusable even in the case of the ancient societies.  <br /> <br />At any rate, his viewpoint is extremely one-dimensional - more one-dimensional than the viewpoint of Marx who believed that the fate of the societies only depends on the class struggle. The \\"environmental irresponsibility\\" is certainly not a unique factor that decides about the fate of the societies; more important ones are the military power to face other civilizations; the economic power - which is also needed to deal with the cruelties of Nature; stable enough moral standards that don't evaporate. <br /> <br />I give Diamond 2 stars because he's sometimes able to write interesting books - and because he's famous and able to sell this bad book a lot. But otherwise, Diamond does not understand science, history, and the modern era. You know, I was brought up in communist Czechoslovakia and those communists were telling us many strange things. But I don't remember that either of them was as narrow-minded and biased against the prosperous West as Diamond is. Neither of them was questioning that the Western system was a viable one and a tough one to compete with. Neither of them was questioning that the economy had to be strong if the society should survive, and the environmental issue was just one of many factors that should influence our decisions.

0385510454|2.0|I am a John Grisham fan...  I have read and loved every book he has written...until today.  I read The Broker in a day.  There is NO character depth.  The apex of this novel is barely recognizable.  I am use to the heart racing Grisham novels and this is nothing but a short story dragged into 300 pages. <br /> <br />And I would advise Mr.Grisham to never use the term, \\"Took a pull off his beer,\\" again as it was so over used in this novel.
0060573775|5.0|I read Vonnegut's masterwork when most people read it- in school. I was too young, and the book was mature and too sad.  I didn't get it.  However, experiencing the book as a middle-aged adult, I get it now.  Oh, boy, do I get it.  It is a rich, rich feast of humanity, humility and soul-retrival. The tenderness with which Vonnegut tells the picaresque tale of Billy Pilgram alleviates the more tragic elements and gives us a melancholy story of a man who just wants to live his life.  Billy Pilgram transcends his life to an almost Buddha-like understanding of suffering, happiness and death.  I listened to the audiotape recently, read by Ethan Hawke. This has to be one of the best audiobooks I have ever listened to.  Ethan Hawkes' spare tone, and lowkey voice are a perfect marriage of prose and interpreter. He brings out flavors and colors that sent me flying back to re-read the book when I finished.  I am richer for the trip.  Listen or re-read Slaughterhouse Five and prepare to be profoundly moved by a master.
B000001Y9I|5.0|if you got here because you are interested in checking out post-Blackmore DP, wait no further and get Perpendicular - this CD is fantastic. For details please check out what other enthusiastic reviewers said (there is no value in reiterating the same ideas) but rest assured that this one absolutely rocks, and is better than Abandon (somewhat darker and heavier) and Bananas (very good but a touch lighter). You can tell that the guys had fun recording this. Steve Morse, at his first album with DP, gives it all and is up there with S.Lukather as far as taste is concerned-his blistering chromatisms fit just perfectly with DP's blues-tinted rock. <br />Enjoy!
0345357116|5.0|Christopher Tolkien, JRR Tolkien's son, took over after his father died.  When Tolkien died he'd left behind all these background stories or things left out from Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit.  So Christopher went and made them into a series of books.  This is just on of them, but it's one of my favorites.  It really helps you see Lord of the Rings in a new light.  Why Saurman acted the way he did toward Gandalf, the Rings themselves, and even though it's more like reading short stories, which can be boring at times, this will keep you interested, and you'll never want to put the book down!
B00003CXCT|5.0|I saw Star Wars in the cinema on its original release in 1977 and I was not slow to buy a ticket for an encore. The sheer experience of that film was exhilerating at a time when movie SFX were still a fair distance away from the quality we know and expect today. Few cinemas had stereo sound then because Dolby Stereo was in its infancy, and to actually be in a cinema so equipped at that time was a rarity. If you were really lucky, in addition to Dolby stereo, it might have a 70mm facility which would give you an enhanced picture, plus a 6 channel stereo split instead of the normal 4 channel of standard Dolby. Nowadays digital stereo in the cinema and home makes that sort of differentiating pretty irrelevent.<br />Seeing Star Wars in stereo and with its incredible effects really was an experience . After that sound and SFX were never going to be the same, and neither have looked back since.<br /><br />Of the three films Return Of The Jedi is in 3rd place, a great film but is simply bettered by the two that came before it. In second place sits Star Wars itself. The film remains one of those viewing experiences which just remains in your mind as a milestone. What effects, what imagination, the ability to lift you out of every day life and take you to a galaxy, far, far away. Who can forget seeing that opening shot of the huge Star Destroyer bearing down on Princess Leia's fleeing vessel?<br />No audiences had seen spaceships of those looks and dimensions on the big screen before...<br />The pride of place by a whisker is taken by The Empire Strikes Back. Of the three films, this is the one that has stood up to more repeat viewings than the others. When I first saw it it did not have the effect that seeing the first did, absorbing though it still was. The passage of time has seen it establish itself as my fave of the trilogy though. I always felt that the plot for Star Wars drew on the Arthurian Legend and nowhere is this more apparent than in The Empire Strikes Back, particularly when the true identity of Darth Vader is revealed for the first time.<br />There is a moodiness about Empire that runs through the film from start to finish, and I often wonder what Jedi would have been like if George Lucas had let the director of Empire Strikes Back - Irvin Kershner helm that film too....<br /><br />As to the controversy of the editing that Lucas has made to the dvd releases, my feelings are as follows:<br />I loved the originals and have the vhs versions of all three. However, with nearly 20 years between Jedi and The Phantom Menace there were always going to be continuity issues concerning casting and SFX. Play an original vhs version of Star Wars, and you will soon see that the mattes have not aged well and stand out visibly. Yet did we notice them at the the time of the films release? No of course not because the SFX then were state of the art. Now with the passage of time and SFX having come on in leaps and bounds, George Lucas decided to update the former films.In my opinion he has done a good job too SFX wise. The casting editing is more to link with the newer editions of the franchise than to improve the quality of the originals, so my thoughts on that are mixed though. I can see the reason for doing it but I simply prefer the original actors in their roles. Clive Revill's Emperor in Empire Strikes Back I think is the deletion that was most unnecessary.<br />Overall though I am glad that I have a choice and can either watch the originals on vhs or put on the updated versions on dvd.<br />I have looked forward to the dvd release of these films for years and am delighted with finally being able to blast them across my home cinema set up. The picture on 16:9 anamorphic is great on a widescreen tv. All sound channels are crisp and totally clear of any distortion. Laser blasts and Tie Fighters shoot across the room to varying degrees...Such is the effect of being able to do that, it has returned me to the awe struck kid seeing Star Wars for the first time in a cinema. Thanks for the dvds, George, it may have taken a while but at least they are here now.nks for the dvds, George, it may have taken a while but at least they are here now.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album came as a complete surprise. Ten years ago, I would have never seen this coming. Hands down, the best album of 2004 and quite possily of this decade.

Every time a track from this album is played on the radio, we get a break from Nickleback and Linkin Park... thank you Green Day!
0380789019|5.0|Richard Mayhew is your average Joe Citizen - an ordinary man with an ordinary life, working at a job he finds dull.  His only spark of interest is his society-climbing, domineering and snobbish girlfriend.  But this ordinary man is about to be plunged into an extraordinary adventure as he, much against his girlfriends wishes, stops to help a girl who is laying bleeding on a London street. <br /> <br />He discovers that he no longer exists in the London he knows so well.  He is now an inhabitant of \\"London Below\\" - a world that is home to the people who have \\"fallen through the cracks\\" of London Above.  Amongst the world of abandoned subway stations and sewers Richard meets some engaging characters, and some more deadly than he has ever seen in the familiar streets. <br /> <br />The girl he has helped is Door, a young woman who is investigating the assassination of her parents.  They set out together on a mission of vengeance - travelling the labyrinth of tunnels to discover who hired the assassins, before Door becomes their next victim.  On the way, they enlist the help of the Marquis of Carabas, a conman who deals in favours, and Hunter, a mysterious Amazon who is hired as Door's bodyguard. <br /> <br />London below is a beautifully created dark world of forbidding shadows and danger.  Against this dark and depressing backdrop, Gaiman creates a cast of colourful characters as our odd trio encounter the angel Islington, the Black Friars, and a rather eccentric birdman - Old Bailey. <br /> <br />Regardless of the fantastic settings and characters, I found Gaiman's novel to be totally believable.  Richard Mayhew is a character that we all know.  Perhaps one that we see in the mirror on a daily basis.  And he comes form the hustle and bustle of a world that we can all relate to.  We even find familiarity in the bizarre characters of London Below - eccentrics, conmen and people out just to push their own agenda. <br /> <br />But, above all, I found the most poignancy inthe allegory of London Below.  When people who don't fit our moulds \\"fall through the cracks\\" of society and become invisible - whether they be homeless, runaways or just different, all of our cities have the dwellers who are invisible to the rest of us. <br /> <br />Neil Gaiman's \\"Neverwhere\\" may not be everyone's cup of tea.  However, I recommend that you buy a copy, draw the curtains, make yourself a hot chocolate and introduce yourself to the sheer brilliance that is \\"Neverwhere\\". <br /> <br />Welcome to London Below...

B000002UWW|5.0|This is a CD of one of the greatest rock bands' stuff from the 80's. As you may know, this consists of songs from their first four albums, along with \\"Under The Bridge\\" from \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\" and \\"Show Me Your Soul\\" from the Pretty Woman soundtrack. My favorite tracks are \\"True Men Don't Kill Coyotes\\", \\"Jungle Man\\", \\"Fight Like A Brave\\", \\"Knock Me Down\\" and definitely the famous \\"Under The Bridge\\". This band still has talent today, but their stuff from the 80's is more of a standout for me. If you only own the band's albums from \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\" and so forth, you don't know what you're missing.

By causing sterotypes to flurish. <br />How is Gray DAMAGING? Once people read these books it sticks to their mind unless they are able to be strong enough to dig deep enough for their own answers to relationships and life. <br />How is Gray DULL? By writing all his books in the same dull formatt.I have read all his books to see how similar they are, <br />and they are all basically the same book in different books. <br />How is Gray deceptive? In his books he will make it sound as <br />though there are exceptions to HIS rules,but he weaves in so  <br />much wordy deception that about \\"differences\\" that people are  <br />more likely to believe him about differences. <br />How is Gray demonic? He is hurting relationships at a deep  <br />level.His books bring to the table all the reasons why men and <br />women should misunderstad one another,than instead of saying the <br />behavior is learned,he calls it innate. <br />The theme which runs through this particular book is that  <br />women need to warm up to sex,are needy,romantic,relational and <br />emotional while men are ready for sex all the time,need sex to <br />feel emotion for someone,are independent and must hide in caves <br />from time to time,logical,non relational.Old bunk.Either men <br />or women can be any of the above mentioned,but he has every  <br />aspect of a person relagated to narrow gender patterns. <br />Unless society breaks free of this,it will fall into a  <br />darkness of the mind,heart and spirit. <br />Anyone who tries to take your individuality from you is as far <br />as I'm concerned the worst of the worst.The worst thing to happen to someone is to have their mind occupied with someone <br />else's mass appeal mind games. <br />
B000000OPZ|5.0|WHITESNAKE - WHITESNAKE&#60;br /&#62;<br />The year is 1987, hair metal is at the top, and Whitesnake releases their big break through album.  Though this was the bands peak they have been making classic blues driven rock since the 1970's.  1984's Slide It In suggested this is where the band was going with this album which brought on a more pop but a more metal sound.  The tag team of David Coverdale and John Sykes on guitar is something out of this world.  Though this is a very pop oriented album it is one of the greatest hard rock/heavy metal albums to ever be released.  It kicks off with \\"Crying In The Rain\\" and rocks all the way through to \\"Don't Turn Away\\".  Sandwiched in the middle of the album is the mega power ballad \\"Is This Love\\" which had a memorable video back in '87.  When hearing the opening guitars by Syke's and Coverdale's howling on \\"Bad Boys\\" I get the chills every single time.  This song is f---ing metal.  Syke's shreds away and performs an amazing solo mid way through the song.  \\"Still of the Night\\" is a memorable tune with an astonishing guitar break down that knocks me off my feet every time I hear it.  This album also produced what is Whitesnake's biggest hit \\"Here I Go Again\\" which is recognized as a hard rock anthem.  The band's follow up Slip of the Tongue was very good but I still say that this is the definitive Whitesnake album.  This album should be owned by anyone who considers themselves a hard rock/heavy metal fan.  If you get the chance to see Whitesnake live anytime soon please do so.  Reb Beach and Doug Aldrich are the two current guitarists and it is just unreal to witness it live.  If you have any doubts about this band being metal they have a dvd on the way sometime in 2005, pick it up and afterwards you'll be picking your jaw off the ground. (5/5)
B00008EY7H|1.0|Given the many glowing reviews of this disk, I am obviously in a minority. The show looks great, but I found the video unwatchable due to the frequent, rapid changes in camera angle. It was impossible to follow the flow of the performance, especially with acts such as the tumblers near the beginning. And the audience reaction shots are distracting and unnecessary. Most people will probably love this, though.
B000062XFG|3.0|After a so-so shakedown season, Star Trek:Tng season 2 premiered in the autumn of 1988. It was soon apparent that year 2 would not be the best this show would offer. A few episodes such as: WHERE SILENCE HAS LEASE, A MATTER OF HONOR, CONTAIGION,and Q-WHO were actually very good, but the rest of the season was poorly written. Buy these dvds only because they belong in your star trek library but remember the best for this show is still a few seasons away.
0345451325|4.0|Halo:The Fall of Reach is a book that tells the story before the events of Halo: Combat Evolved, the video game.  This story entails the story of the SPARTAN projects and does so very well. I am not going to get into the details because that is what the book is for and I dare not ruin any of the story or the history revealed.      This book is very very well written, and the way the action plays out is simply amazing.  The story is extravigant and it fills in the holes and answers some of the questions people have if you start with the game like I did.      This novel actually made me go back and play through Halo: Combat Evolved again because Master Chief is amazing, and the holes this novel filled in terms of character is awe inspiring.    The only reason that this magnificient novel did not get a perfect five star rating is because from a critical standpoint, the grammer sucked.  For a published work in which one has an editor and the book should be proof read, there were an outragous amount of spelling errors and even a mix up in the letters of a name.  To the credit of the author the errors do not impede on the story they just make one look twice.  They were not so outragous where you could not tell what the author was saying and there was no fragments.    hope this helps it is a great book and if you are a fan of Halo read this, play the first game again (skip HALO: THE FLOOD, caus that book is basically the game but less fun), and read HALO: FIRST STRIKE
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|The Bourne Supremacy begins very soon after The Bourne Identity ends.  The film has a rather unique feel to it, like a James Bond Film but with more angst and action that is less over the top and more improvised - giving it a more relatable feel.  Some scenes are very exciting, and Bourne's train of thought will leave the viewer thinking,'Cool, his solution to that dangerous/deadly situation was amazing, yet really simple'.  The forces of evil also put a lot of thought and skill into their actions, and it increases the viewer's respect for the danger they pose to Bourne.  The primary assassin is very cool, and very lethal with a weapon at great distances, as we see in the film.    All the performances are very understated, which makes this action film more interesting and unique. Bourne has the same hidden demons he had from 'Identity', and a sudden tragic loss brings out his dark side even more in this film.  Yet, like a double edged sword, it also forces him to make a decision on how to respond to his actions of the past.  Brian Cox plays a really good 'bad cop'.  Karl Urban uses extremely limited dialogue to create a very cool assassin. The most welcome reprise is by Julia Stiles, sucked back into Bourne's life for her previous involvement with 'Treadstone'.  She complemented some scenes very well in the film. Many of the characters have  agendas that are kept in the dark for whatever reason, and it gives the story some pretty good intruige.    The locations you see in the film definitely give it some character.  It's fun to watch international espionage because you get to travel whereever the agents travel, and in this film we visit beaches and markets in India, hotels and train stations in Germany, and the highways and projects of Moscow. One of my favorite shots in the film occurs after Bourne tries to make amends for dark deeds of his past, and the camera pans up a Moscow project at the dusk of winter with blue lighted windows stretched from one edge of the screen to the other.  It's brief, but very beautiful.  The musical accompaniment makes the scene very emotional.    All in all, the film is worth its viewing, and the Bourne film franchise is shaping up to be a very entertaining series in cinema.

B000002UA0|5.0|When you look at the reviews for this album you can see there are two camps, one camp believes this is the best thing Floyd ever did and everything else is rubbish, the other would rather have their teeth drilled than listen to Piper. What group do I fall in, neither but I honestly lean to the former, and this album is in my top three Floyd albums, along with Atom Heart Mother and Animals, but Piper is not the only good Floyd album ever made. <br /> <br />Piper is unlike any other Floyd album musically or lyrically, for one major reason Almost every song on this album is written by Syd Barret there is not even a hint of David Gilmour, the man that would later take Syd's place in the band as guitairest\singer. This album is Syd Barret's masterwork, combining space rock, and psychadelic pop, this is not only one of Pink Floyd's greatest works it is also one of the greatest albums of the sixties. Syd also has a very different guitar style, not great technically but he was one of the few people that would drop ball bearings down the neck, or use a zippo for slide guitar work. The songs on this album are very different. I think the best way to describe this album is to go song by song. <br /> <br />1. Astronomy Domine- This is an extremely strong opener starting out with a pounding Bass and an awesome guitar riff we then head into the awesome verse and then we go into the instrumental freak out in the middle which is only the first of many instrumental freakouts on the album before heading back to the verse, amazing track <br /> <br />2. Lucifer Sam- Starting out with a million variations on the spy riff this is the closest the album gets to conventional rock musc but trust me it is still extremely trippy. Once again amazing track. <br /> <br />3. Maltida Mother- Possibally my favorite track of the album. Syd's ode to bedtime stories sounds epic, but is relaxing at the same time, awesome mid section. <br /> <br />4. Flaming- This track is very upbeat, and has some very strange instrumentations. IT is vey hard to explain. <br /> <br />5. Pow R. Toc H.- This is the first of two space rock instrumentals, great piano work on Rick's part. Syd makes some odd sounds with his mouth, is a human beat-box, and does some really strange things with his guitar. <br /> <br />6. Take up thy Stethoscope and walk- The only song not being written or co-written by Syd. This is Rogers song, featuring great wordplay and an awesome jam section, it's a great song. <br /> <br />7. Intersteller Overdrive- This a group effort and the second space rock instrumental on the album this song is amazing being built around a central riff for the first three minutes of the song before everything falls apart, the song then goes back to the main riff but it's being played in two seperate channels. This is such an awesome song. <br /> <br />8. The Gnome- I guess this could be considered folk. It's a song about a gnome, mostly the aucoustic guitar, would fit in on a Beatles album. <br /> <br />9. Chapter 24- This is basically Chapter 24 of I-Ching read over calm, almost spiritual music, Capter 24 takes awhile to grow on you, but when it does you'll love it. <br /> <br />10. The Scarecrow- Psychadelic folk, this is a nice light-weight tune. It is another great song. <br /> <br />11. Bike- This is another extremely odd, but awesome tune. This is one of those songs that only Barret could pull off, after the song seemingly ends we hear a bunch of weird noises. The perfect album closer for Piper. <br /> <br /> Following the release of this album, drugs stared to take their toll on Syd. He was only able to do one more album with Pink Floyd, and on that he only contributed one song, unlike Piper where he writes almost every track. So in closing if you're a fan of Floyd, and you want something different give this album a try who knows you may just like it.
0446677450|1.0|The book talks in broad strokes about acquiring assets that generate income for you.  While great in concept, its not really something that most people interested in building wealth did not already know.  Beyond that, the book is short on detail and substance. <br /> <br />More disturbing is the fact that this book appears to be a front for pushing multi-level marketing scams, i.e. Amway.  There is apparently some relationship between the author and Amway aka Quixtar.   <br /> <br />Those truly interested in ways to build wealth should look elsewhere - more substantive and valuable advice is available from different authors.

0312330529|5.0|This is quite simply one of the best works of \\"fiction\\" I've ever read. The story is absolutely entralling. It stays with you for months after you've finished reading it. Like several other reviewers here, I dreaded coming to the end of the book, and when I finished that last page, I was overcome with a feeling of loss, like I'd lost a love one.  <br />I stumbled on to this book by chance; I was at the BBC in London, doing publicity interviews for my band, when I met the author of Shantaram, who was there with his agent, also doing some interviews. I was invited to his book launch party in London that evening. I went with my bandmates, and Mr. Roberts and his agent never showed up! This didn't much impress the members of the London press that were there, but we all left the party with copies of the novel. Now I've read it twice, and have bought several copies for friends.
B00005JMYI|1.0|I didn't have alot of expectations&that was a good thing.the film like so many of recent time try to get back into the 70's&use a Soundtrack of Songs to reflect the time period but do it all in a bad party kind of way which never gets fully off the ground.I didn't find this film that much interesting at all.there were a couple of aight funny moments,but it's pretty forgettable.
0385513755|5.0|I received this book for Christmas and it took a bit to pick it up.  But once I did, I could not put it down.  Whatever your religous beliefs are you cannot turn away from what has been learned while reading this book.  I have always been interested in Da Vinci, Monet and other artist.  I have seen most of the art in books through out the years, and I have failed to see the obivious in the paintings.  It certainly gets the wheels working.  I would highly recommend this book.
0385510454|3.0|Joel Backman, ex-lobbyist and Washington power broker doing time in a Federal prison is pardoned after only six years of a twenty-year sentence by a one-term president at the behest of the CIA, hours before the inauguration of the new president. The theory is that many influential people want Backman dead (the Saudi's, the Israeli's, the Chinese, the Russian's...), that eventually one of them will take him out and the CIA will be privy to some long sought after information. Thus, the ex-power broker becomes a pawn for the government and the chase is on.<br /><br />The Agency drops Backman into Bologna, Italy, an entirely different culture where he must meld into the general population. This is what Grisham does best, establish a protagonist with the vast resources of power stacked against him, outwitting and, hopefully, outlasting. As in his first novel, the Firm, though the plot differs substantially, the theme is familiar, the underdog vs. the heavy lifters.<br /><br />In a vastly changed world of spy satellites and sophisticated electronics, each nation's gain can change the face of history. When Backman was brokering the satellite network deal that got him into trouble with the Federal government, he made some powerful enemies, not the least of which are in his own government, engaged in a never-ending technology race and looking for an edge. Now Backman is challenged to use his considerable resourcefulness, this time to keep himself alive.<br /><br />While not as tautly conceived as The Firm, Grisham inserts a lot of disparate details into the plot, leaving some unresolved questions, but he concentrates on Backman and his natural instincts toward survival, especially once his whereabouts is leaked to the interested parties. Once Backman is the focus of every assassination network, he needs more than luck to pull this one off. Whatever is lacking in plot depth, there is ample praise for the city's architecture, gourmet dishes and cosmopolitan citizens to pique the curiosity of travelers and epicures alike.

B0001I55SS|5.0|The DVD is much cleaner and clearer than my VHS copy.  I think Disney could have put together a better DVD package.  I was hoping for a few more documentaries, even a commentary track.  But given that it's not that popular of a movie, or even a critically acclaimed one, I doubted that would happen.  The documentary provided on the disc gave me a respect for the processes and technological breakthroughs (of the time)for the Black Hole. <br /> <br />As for the film itself...There are some films out there that no matter how \\"stiff\\" or \\"bad\\" the acting, how \\"horrible\\" the plot, how \\"cheesy\\" the dialog, how un-scientific certain elements of the film may be (even though the film is labeled Science Fiction...emphasis on Fiction) you will genuinely enjoy and grow to have a real fondness for, despite it's perceived flaws.   <br /> <br />The Black Hole in my opinion is one of these films.  The Black Hole carried me with its concept.  I liked every character(okay, B.O.B got on my nerves sometime)in the movie.  I like Dr. Durant's search for scientific truth and his growing admiration for the superior genius of Dr Reinhardt, I also liked the psychic connection between Kate and V.I.N.CENT. (though unexplained in the film how a human can have a psychic link with a robot...yet it's an interesting concept.) <br /> <br />Anyway if you're looking for an enjoyable movie that may (it probably will) leave you with questions and commentary on acting, plot, dialog, and questionable science...Then this Disney classic is tailor made for you.   <br /> <br />Note: John Barry's fantacular score for The Black Hole greatly enhances your listening and viewing pleasure.  I also enjoyed the spiritual/biblical connotations within the film. <br /> <br />enommaz
068987474X|1.0|Do you want to feel bad about yourself?  Do you want to feel really pathetic?  Then read this book!  It basically describes every type of woman out there and calls her pathetic.  After lambasting you, it tells you that you are a goddess and deserve better, but who hears that part of the message? <br />I thought the book would be a hoot, and since I'm not even dating anyone I didn't think I'd find any part applicable to me, but it made me feel terrible about myself anyway.  This book spouts outdated advice such as \\"never call a guy, let him call you\\" because if he doesn't rush to call you,\\"he's just not into you.\\"  Please!  I think that gives guys a little too much credit.  Some men are just intimidated by powerful women and need a little coaxing.  I know plenty of men who never ask out that beautiful woman, even if she seems interested in them.  This book claims if the guy really likes the girl, nothing will stop him from asking her out.  Well, I wish I knew the guys interviewed for this book because I don't think they realistically reflect the dating pool. <br />Don't waste your money on this book which devalues all the hard work of the women's movement.  This book receives a big thumbs down!
B0002YLC24|5.0|This sequel was really welcome and it was just magnificent! Saw \\"Before Sunrise\\" many years ago and was wondering if there would be a sequel. <br /> <br />It was worth waiting for it. Contrary to some reviews posted, it is my belief that watching \\"Before Sunrise\\" is a pre-requisite to watching \\"Before Sunset\\". <br /> <br />The dialogues are profound, especially in \\"Before Sunset\\", and they are what gives the sense of regaining connection after nine years with Celine and Jesse and how life has turned out wrong for the both of them. <br /> <br />They have put to bed - as Jesse says in one of the dialogues - the notion of a \\"romantic love\\" on that December 16. But it is so poignant watching these two people grasping the moment (and the chance) to fulfill their most cherished dreams. <br /> <br />What is noteworth, though, is that there is no loving, sensual or desperate kissing. Actually the only kisses they exchange are the ones that European people use to greet old friends. Most of the time they do not even touch each other, but you can see the connection between them in subtle gestures, looks exchanged, and the conversation. <br /> <br />And the most beautiful scene, in my opinion, is when Jesse is talking about the dreams he has and how he wakes up sobbing and Celine tries to touch him... <br /> <br />This movie is worth seeing but to really appreciate it, you must forget about the fast paced action that are good only for the eyes. This movie is not for the eyes, it is for the heart.
0441009425|5.0|if you are a fan of cinematic storytelling, hard science fiction and grand space adventures, this should be your next sci-fi read. it's very imaginative, reynolds created the relvelation space universe in rich detail, with a lot of history and background. <br />the story itself is fast paced and thrilling, the characters compelling and modern. at times it almost reads like scenes from a japanese animation cinema.
B000088E7Y|5.0|I have been listening to this album for almost 30 years and it is as fresh and satisfying today as it was in the '70's. As expected the songwriting and instrumentation are beautiful. This is Randy's best album. Give it a good listen. It is simply a work of high art. <br /> <br />Steve C.
B00008DDXC|2.0|This is a failure of a movie and of a book adaptation. Yes, I'm aware they were faithful to the book, but trying to fit the whole book into two hours and a half is a bad idea. It was full of scenes that made no difference to the plot and you are forced to watch. This movie does not have a inch of the spirit of the books. What happened to the magic? Why do the kids have flashlights to go to the forest? They can produce the lumos charm. It seems like in a lot of scenes they do stuff the \\"muggle\\" way. What happened to Hogwarts? We just see a corridor in Hogwarts in this movie, the great hall and a few classes; they could have used some of their money to build a prettier Hogwarts. What I'm trying to say is, the magic of the book and the spirit of the book are lost in the unnecessary scenes of the movie. The special effects are pretty bad compared to all the money that they have. Most of the things in the movie are fake robots that are way to obvious that aren't real. Fake robot Whomping Willow, fake robot Hedwig the owl, fake robot Basilisk. Fawkes one of the creatures that are computer animated doesn't look too real but doesn't look as bad as the fake robot stuff. They also add a lot of horrible stuff to the movies like the flying car almost being hit by the school train and Harry falling out of the car. These things are stupid and down right corny. There are also a lot of other corny scenes throughout the movie, which will make you laugh, like the ending, which I will not spoil because of the corny fun. It shows that director Chris Columbus (which is know for his corny children flicks) cannot handle emotional scenes so well. I gave this film 2 stars because the story is really good (but that is because of JK Rowling) and it may be fun for your child. It is one of those films that become really boring after watching more than three times.
B0006399FS|1.0|it gives me sad yet to see some fans celebrating this filth of 49 minutes titled HTDAAB. Sure U2 knows perfectly that they don't have to make an effort in a 60 minutes long album, since they always will have blinded fans that eats from the Bono's empty words.     Bono now is a very rich and avaricious men ( musician ? ), that he only wishes that you have a credit card and don't think about the awful U2 dying.   If you have much money, credit cards and all that stuff, you're so much important for Bono. But if you don't have anything of that, you're a loser.   And some fans still support his wallet...     They have officially lost us as a fan. We can't stand this iPod product wrongly credited as \\"U2\\". They have settled in nicely in their superstar status, courtesy of some U2 snobs.    This is the horrifying sound of an absolute creative vacuum, there's nothing left but the heinous hubris of rockstar ego. And it's a really boring ego. It's music only a mother can love. A bunch of drunk teens may finish and record a by far better record. Keep your memories, play the old stuff and most importantly, save your money. We should be paid TO listen to this.  \\"You need many listens to grows on you\\" pointed out some easy fans. Not true, you need many listens to think artificially by being generous with U2 that this commercial fraud is not so bad. The only thing that \\"grows on me\\" is the dissapointment and the sensation of being ripped off by this record company - Grammy and MTV friendly -called \\"U2\\".    Let's face the truth: Yet some fans think \\"it's the best since Achtung Baby !!\\"... Just \\"Stay\\", \\"Staring At The Sun\\" or \\"Please\\" alone blow away this recycled soup. Bono sings like a drunkard with laryngitis, The Edge is a joke of himself once again, and Adam and Larry don't exist here. their bubble has burst and they are stuck in the mud. Used \\"messages\\", irrelevant songs. Just more of the same cockie. They spent more time focused in marketing campaing than anything else.     (...)
B00003CXI1|3.0|It is an ok movie to watch but if you read the books it's not that great. I'm okay about leaving little things out of the book, but this is too much. Because they cut out all the enjoyable parts of the book, like the midnight duel, when Harry and Hermione take Baby Norbert to the north tower, the potions logic challenge, etc. And where has Neville gone, he was very present in the book but not in this movie. The special affects are very bad compared to other movies too. What I'm trying to say is if you have never read the book you will probably find this enjoyable (because even with some of the most enjoyable scenes missing it is still has got some enjoyable parts) but if you read the book you will always prefer the book than this movie, it will still be enjoyable for you but you will always prefer reading the books. This is also not the kind of movie that you can watch again and again. It can get boring in a few times of watching.
B0000AUHPB|1.0|Some movies age well. This isn't one of them. Too much focus on what studs the guys are, and what totally clueless sex objects the women are. It's not even fun to watch as a period piece. The version with Edward Norton, Mark Wahlberg, et al, is much tighter and smarter and a heck of a lot more fun to watch. Don't even rent this piece of junk.
B00005JMAH|4.0|Wow, this film is truly amazing, much better than Chamber of Secrets for sure. Alfonso Cuaron is an amazing director and he made an amazing film! Finally it does the book justice, not by being faithful but by keeping the sprit of the book alive in the scenes. In every scene there is something magical. Azkaban is a very dark Harry Potter movie but there is just enough comic relief to satisfy you. It stuck to the central plot and most of the stuff that didn't have anything to do with the main plot were dropped, but it's mostly a good thing because the flow of the movie is much better.  <br />The special effects are so good in this movie that it blows the first two away! Finally a Harry Potter movie with no more fake robots! I congratulate them on Buckbeak (the hippogriff) and on the Whomping Willow scene (amazing). <br />The acting was much improved in this movie. Daniel Radcliffe who was stiff and inexperienced came out much better in this movie where he worked on a much more emotional side. Emma Watson is better than usual in this film and is the best out of the three. Rupert Grint, well, he is a good actor but all he does is make stupid faces in this film. <br />The mood of this film captured the mood of the book perfectly and the flow of the movie is great, this made me love this movie. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because non-book readers may get a bit confused on this scene in the very end of the movie that goes really fast, the should have added 8 more minuets to it so the audience could understand it better, but other than that it was great. I liked how Cuaron made the teenage world in Hogwarts so perfect. It's cool to see them react like regular kids for once, like in a scene in the Gryffindor House dormitory where the boys where eating animal candies.  <br />Hogwarts looked so much better in this film, so much more like the beautiful ones we read in the books. Every inch of it was filled with detail. Some of you complain because Hagrid'scabin and the Whomping Willow where in different locations in this film, but so what? It looks much more like Hogwarts now and it's better looking. <br />This movie is great and I hope Goblet of Fire is as good as this one (or if I'm lucky, better!) <br />
B0002XDODU|4.0|Rammstein have come some way from their Herzeleid days, with the Sehnsucht leap its been difficult to surpass themselves. But they proved they could acoplish this task with the brilliant Mutter, their follow-up. Now, Reise, Reise has arrived. I can safely say is more of the same elements: epic orchestral influeces, operatic vocals, hammering guitars, and thundering sound. But, was it worth the 4 year wait? To the faithful, yes. Chances are, it'll invite more fans as this is a nicely accessible album with tracks like Amerika and Reise, Reise. But, this time Rammstein have only equaled themselves to previous efforts. Sure, its better than Sehnsucht, but I wouldn't recommend it over Mutter.<br /><br />Reise, Reise: *****/***** Epic and exiting. The strings fuse great with the guitars and drums. Lindemann's vocals are envigorating.<br /><br />Mein Teil: *****/***** Perhaps the best track next to Reise. Thundering guitars, creepy vocals and funny lyrics. Very creepy track.<br />Dalai Lama: ****/***** Its good, but too long. Very hauntingand atmospheric, almost brilliant, it just drags, giving no real payoff.<br /><br />Keine Lust: ***/***** Nice, heavy and fast paced. Kinda looses itself around the second half.<br /><br />Los: ***/***** Nice, bluesy track. But not too Rammstein. Nice try though.<br /><br />Amerika: *****/***** Funny. The highpoint is the thundering guitars with the solo in between near the end.<br /><br />Moskau: ****/***** Fun track. I loved the accordion solo, but the female vocals tend to get tiring.<br /><br />Morgenstern ****/***** Fun song. Haunting choir, mean guitars and  rather emotional.<br /><br />Stein Um Stein *****/***** Scary, emotional vocals( Till plays with the gutteral and clear), nicely composed. One of the best tracks. The most emotional song here as well as the most violent. Specially good near the end where Lindemann screams \\"stine\\" and the solo kicks in.<br /><br />Ohne Dich: ***/***** Good, but sounds too contrived and borders onpretention. Fan pleaser.<br /><br />Amour: ****/***** Great song, too slow, but Flake shows great minimalistic skill.<br /><br />So, it's worth checking out. One of the best of 2004, but its not much of an innovation for Rammstein.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Yes, I saw these movies when I was a kid.  However the extra disc with interviews with George Lucas and the actors was incredible.

B00064MW6A|5.0|Shame on people for bashing this film.  It's the greatest piece of cinematic brilliance ever.  It's such a deep film unlike superficial nonsense like The Aviator and Sideways.  Catwoman should be a model for all movies!
B00005JLF5|5.0|At the height of Star Trek popularity the producers of the show created a spin off about a man who'd lost his wife, and was assigned to command the recently wrestled from Cardassian control Terok Nor (Renamed Deep Space Nine by the Federation of Planets). His name, Benjamin Sisko... And he didn't want to be there. Regardless, being the good soldier that he is he takes his son and relocates to the station where he meets the moody Kira Nyrese, the shape shifting Odo, the scheming Quark, and a reincarnation (sort of) of his old friend Dax.<br /><br /> DS9 got off to an excellent start with a very \\"odd couple\\" type feeling to the entire cast. Everyone was a misfit, no one really fit in, and this set the series apart from the other Treks. But to make matters more interesting Benjamin Sisko's life is turned even further upside down when he accidentally discovers a wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant, and while going back to the Alpha Quadrant of the galaxy he is \\"abducted\\" by non-caporal alien life forms. Because of this encounter the Bajorans (Major Kira's people) now believe that Sisko is the emissary of their deities. They believe the aliens in the wormhole are their Prophets, and if asked these aliens will state that they are \\"of Bajor\\". Sisko becomes a religious icon, and so the saga begins.<br /><br /> What I love about Deep Space Nine is that it removed the cowboy diplomacy of previous installments. The crew of DS9 was stationary, and had to deal with the consequences of their actions, unlike Kirk and Picard who could just fly off to the next planet, Sisko was stuck dealing with the problems that were created.<br /><br /> Season 1 does not delve into the Dominion, but does begin the development of each and every major character right away. DS9 developed their characters the best of any Trek. Unlike previous installments, this show wasn't satisfied focusing on the captain and one or two of his underlings. Everyone got good screen time in DS9, and even by the end of season 1 we knew our crew very well.<br /><br /> Because DS9 developed its characters so well it is, in my mind, the best of the treks. I am grateful to Paramont for these box sets, though I do feel they are awefully expensive (Fox's 24 in contrast runs about $50-60 a set). A price drop would be nice, but as of now I'm only two seasons short of the collection. Deep Space Nine is TV as it should be. Great stories with great role models for our kids, episodes that are completely inoffensive, and completely entertaining. I wish DS9 had never ended. Of all of the TV shows I love that are now gone I miss DS9 the most.ur crew very well.  <br /> Because DS9 developed its characters so well it is, in my mind, the best of the treks.

0684833395|5.0|> AS I recall the editor of this book changed the title from Catch 18 to Catch 22. I think the editor was right a much Catch-ier title. If you have not read this book take my advice, read the book, read the other reviews with the 5 star ratings and take their advise, I'm really to tired to review this book properly but not so tired as to recognize the wisdom of some of my fellow five star'er'ers.STOP READING! just read the book Joseph Heller I aint!... I havnt been this tired since I was a young man of eleven, my brother Charles Chadwick and I had a good friend nicknamed Big John who set up a waste basket on the ground floor of our families unfinished cottage and he decided to play Dresden. He climbed upstairs where my dad kept all his old playboy magazines, dropped his boxers and dropped a few biscuits in warning (as the allies did in WW2) and then zeroed in on the basket. We all ran for the woods and hid until dusk and then snuck around to the house avoiding Big John because we were afraid of being caught and becoming forced labor in the cleanup in Big Johns reenactment of the Dresden bombing. Even as kids we understood the importance of learning from history...Speaking of history I had a good conversation with Big Johns younger brother Roscoe about the Dresdan story and he remembered hearing about about it but was not present, he mentioned that knowing his brother as he does (as a brother) that it all made perfect sense. He related to me a story about when Big John and Big Joe (Big Joe is Roscoes twin,he was younger than Big John as well, in addition he was not as big as Big John despite the fact that he was big) would play a game with a rubber ball when the folks were out of the house, kind of like basketball except the object was to throw the ball in the toilet, the looser had to fish the ball out. However as Roscoe explained and what ads credence to my Dresdan story is that Big John would always make Big Joe fish the ball out no matter who made the basket...Off the subject abit but I cant help myself, my friend Roscoe is a self-made millionaire, he had the idea a few years ago to convert old washing machines into dog houses and made a fortune, he cashed out and travels the states with his girl friend Lora lee lee and his monkey Tater.
B000001FTJ|3.0|Don't get me wrong, there are a couple gems on this recording, but it fails to have a flow. Everytime I think about how mediocre this album is I have to remind myself that this was a major move for Waits and he was still experimenting with this sound. That is why I give it 3 stars, it is a remarkable change.
B000092ZYX|5.0|According to Thom Yorke, this is the last Radiohead album by the band we currently recognize as Radiohead.  I don't know what that means any more than you do, but I guess we'll just have to wait and see. <br /> <br />I never like a Radiohead album on the first listen. Ever. The first time I borrowed OK Computer, I gave it back very quickly. The first time I listened to Kid A, I put it back on the shelf with the intent of never listening to it again. Same with Amnesiac. Same with Hail to the Theif. Invariably, I end up putting the album back on again, and then again the next day, and so on, and by the end of the week, I'm in love. <br /> <br />Thief sounds like all the other Radiohead albums, but also sounds nothing like any other Radiohead album ever. The thing about Radiohead is you can't fully understand the album unless you heard the album before it. OK Comp makes more sense after hearing The Bends, Kid A sounds better after hearing OK Comp, Amnesiac after Kid A, and Thief after hearing all of the above. <br /> <br />\\"2+2=5\\" starts off with a buzz, and you're waiting for another electronic landscape a la Amnesiac, but shortly thereafter, the buzz turns out to be the buzz of a guitar amp, and it goes into an acoustic number. The whole album is reminiscant of that theme: marrying their stranger, electronic expirements, with good old fashioned rock Radiohead. <br /> <br />The results... are spellbinding. <br /> <br />Buy this album. It's Radiohead through and through.

B00009M6VJ|5.0|Alan Parker made an invaluable and potent statement about such controversial theme . He built and admirable puzzle with many dramatic twists all along the film which deserved to my mind a major treatment and consideration .<br /><br />In the last two decades I just remember three admirable works about this similar theme : The Fifth Chapter of Decalogue , Dead man walking and Dancer in the dark.<br /><br />Spacey plays a very credible role and despite the female counterpoint is not at the same level ( the role was perfect for Cate Blanchet , Juliette Binoche or Naomi Watts) the film reaches the goal . I think something happens with Parker when he decides to make edge of the knife pictures : Midnight express , Mississippi burning have not been rated by the most of critics ;  it would seem Parker is accepted only when he films musicals<br /><br />Intelligent , mature and outstanding movie .
B00004W510|5.0|And in 1969, The Band proved that it could change everything, and then some. They weren't just producing a smart and inescapable rebellion, but they were producing one that they nearly envisioned occuring in the song \\"King Harvest (Has Surely Come\\"). And that is the key to this whole album--if you are so inclined to look below the surface. Here was a group that said why follow the rules? These rules aren't the old rules, so we will go another direction here and you can either follow or not. We don't care. We know we need to do this. So calling their music courageous is an understatement. There is always too much depth and intelligence in Band songs for me to describe them all or try to explain to you what I think about each individual masterpiece. Yet there is one song here that can almost always bring tears to my eyes. The song will be a mystery to anyone who isn't creative, and even some creative people may not understand the passion and seriousness of the composition itself. \\"Whispering Pines\\" is a lonesome song, with a heart-breaking chorus ('the lost are found') that is almost overwhelming in its complexity and accuracy. However the song is gentle while moody, saddening while searching, and all the while it seems to be the embodiment of the freedom that musicians had during the sixties. At its core, it is the tale of a poet who can't quite write or attain originality the way he used to, and now if only one star (an idea or spark of creative thought) shines, he sees that his life is back on track with purpose, and there is still hope to find a meaning. What else were the people of this generation doing if not looking for a meaning that in the end they never could find? Pure GENIUS. Once again, the Band cannot be judged by the songs of theirs that charted or the ones that are the most popular. They created real art, and it is meant to be album-listening music, so buy all the original albums and give them close listens all the way through without breaking up the songs or the singles. This is artistic expression that defies the market and moves into the realm of ingenious songwriting and powerful performance. Their \\"hit\\" songs were nowhere near their best, and it is hard to single out one Band song that is their finest. Even get the emotionally-shattering NORTHERN-LIGHTS, SOUTHERN-CROSS before your exploring is complete. I miss the Band, Danko, Manuel (the greatest voice ever), all of them. If you love this album and are interested in the Band, do yourself a favor and buy the CLASSIC ALBUMS video release about this record; it isn't enough to simply call it an achievement. The video will give you fascinating insights into the Band's creative and performance process, and it will show you how much hard work it takes to make a REAL album full of real music. Simply brilliant all the way around.
B00063MBU8|1.0|If this is what the kids today call punk, then all of the members of the clash are throwing up somewhere. This is no different to me than Good Charlotte,Yellowcard, etc.....it's crap by a bunch of whiny idiots. \\"Oh my life is sooooo tough, my mommy tossed my Han Solo figure in the trash and tore up my baseball cards. B-B-Booooooo Hooooooo!\\". I'm so punk it's hard for anyone to even understand it. <br /> <br />What is punk? It's not dressing like every other band out there and putting out music like everyone else has out. It's Rich King's Breakfast Nook. How punk be the nook? I walk out of my house dressed in a batman costume with a waffle house hat. I then ride a big wheel that I've kept modifying to keep up with my growth. I'll ride it on major streets to annoy people. Why? Because I'm punk, that's why. Punk is going Burger King and ordering General Tsao's chicken. When they tell you they don't have it, you jump up on the counter and play air guitar to old Clash tunes. That's punk, not this garbage.
B000021XS0|5.0|Scenes from a Memory is the long-awaited sequel to IAW Metropolis Pt. 1. It is a concept album which story is quite complex to follow if you are not reading the lyrics. To fully understand the story I recommend you visit [...] It is important to remember that John Petrucci, Mike Portnoy, and Jordan Rudess, had just finished recording Liquid Tension Experiment 2 so it is only logical if you find LT influences in some songs like in Overture 1928. If you did not like such an experiment, I do not recommend this album.  It all begins with Regression, a two-minute introduction where you listen to the Hypnotherapist. Overture 1928,  an incredible three-minute masterpiece that is the first of two instrumental songs SFAM includes, has a Liquid Tension orientation. The second one, The Dance of Eternity, recovers a heavier, more traditional Dream Theater sound. Strange Deja Vu, contains the same musical structure as Overture, however, LaBrie does sing here.  Through my Words is a short LaBrie Rudess duo that introduces Fatal Tragedy, one of my favorites.  What I love about Fatal Tragedy is the insane instrumental section that concludes it.... simply breath-taking. Beyond This Live is the heaviest song this album has. It narrates what the a newspaper said about the murder that occured back in 1928. The final scene of Act I is Through Her Eyes. It is a very light rock which expreses what the main character (Nicholas) is undergoing at the time.   Act II starts off with Home. Excellent epic that re-takes some aspects of Metropolis Pt 1. After Home, Dream Theater overwhelms us once again with The Dance of Eternity. This six-minute beauty is way better than previous instrumentals like Erotomania and Hell's Kitchen. One Last Time and The Spirit Carries On are again two light songs which gives us, the listeners, a break from the effect Home and The Dance of Eternity had just left us (shock). Finally Free is the last scene, where everything is solved (who killed who, etc.) but despitethat the song in general is highly entertaining. I guess you could say it's SFAM's Learning to Live (Images and Words).  This is Dream Theater's best effort. If you want to listen to progressive rock/metal, this is as good as it gets.
B000002WPI|5.0|the greatest album ever made. you are not a fan of hip hop if this CD is not in your collection. 'nuff said
B00000JLWW|3.0|I agree with what someone said before about lack of extras.  This was a major blockbuster; it received umpteen Oscars and bushels of accolades from the viewing public and some critics.  There's probably an equal number of negative reviews.  Either way the film was very much hyped.  I can't believe that extras wouldn't be included on the dvd.  The theatrical trailer and subtitles hardly count.  Where are the bloopers?  Where are the behind-the-scenes documentaries?  Where are the interviews with the cast and crew?  Where is a mini-documentary about the real Titanic - giving us a run down of the comparative dinner menus for first,second and third class passengers?  Okay, maybe that's asking too much.  After all, I did see just that at the Titanic exhibit at one of our city museums yesterday and I know there are lots of books and films about the real thing.  But still - I've come to expect more from DVDs than just the movie.  Call me spoiled! <br /> <br />As for the film itself, I'll add my two cents to the thousand dollar bill.  Amazing special affects and great attention to period piece details.  Affecting portrayals by the actors who played the captain, the ship designer and Rose's mom.  And what's not to love about Kathy Bates? The extras and the stunt folks were good too.  Leo and Kate - well, it was the script that sank them.  I kinda liked their interaction in the beginning, but I could have done without Jack and Rose calling each others' names a thousand times within certain scenes, Jack and Rose spitting and the repulsive \\"hand slap on the sweaty window\\" scene.  This story could have been more of an ensemble piece.  After all, with 2200 souls on the real Titanic there were lots of interesting characterizations to be had.  And even sticking to the ever popular love triangle theme, the three could have been more than just types.  Why not flesh out the characters a bit, if only by making the fiance less mean, the princess less suicidal, and the orphaned poor artist less confident.  Over all, its worth seeing at least once for the special effects and you do get a better sense of how tragic and traumatic that night was for all involved.
B0002YLC24|5.0|This movie and the prequel, Before Sunrise, must truly be enjoyed together.  When I saw the first movie as a high-schooler nine years ago, I was amazed at the concept of a truly profound connection developed in a short time with a stranger.  It hit me so hard because I had had a similar experience: meeting someone for a night and talking about everything in my little, young life all night long.  Unfortunately, it was not in an exciting city such as Vienna, Austria, but in a Denny's in small-town Oregon.   <br />  <br />Now, viewing the sequel as a citizen of the world 9 years later, I have learned so many of the same lessons that the characters have learned.  I see so much of myself in their conversations and appreciate the gravity of re-connecting with someone from your past.  This movie ties together two very different points of time, and more importantly, two very different points of these people's lives.  As time moves forward, the best part of being in relationships, whether romantic, familial or friendships, is to see people grow.  Seeing these two characters and their growth over the 9 years is like seeing myself and my friends grow as well.  I appreciate the lessons they have learned and feel more connected with the world b/c I have shared so many of the same lessons. <br /> <br />This movie and its prequel appeal to me because I feel like like I personally relate to the characters.  I recommend watching the first and second movies together (if you haven't seen the first) and reflecting on your own views and choices nine years ago versus the present. However, if conversation and reflection bore you, I recommend you don't watch either and rent a mind-numbing action flick.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|The lyrics on Avril's new CD are good, you can definetly tell she put a lot of work into them, but they are also kind of repetitive. Even the first time I listened to it, I got pretty bored about halfway through. Avril can belt, for sure, but she needs to show some different sides of her voice.  Plus, she needs to learn some stylizing techniques. There's no added ups or downs in the way she sings, making you just sit there and wait for something to happen. Whatever song she sings, whatever the subject matter is, she doesn't show any emotion in her voice, so you're listening to her songs, and it just seems like she's a poker face about all of these deep subjects she's talking about. She never shows any vulnerabilty; her voice is always strong and has an angry tone to it.  <br />The reason I bought this CD was because I loved the last one and I heard Don't tell me and My  Happy Ending, and so I thought the rest of her songs would be like that as well. I was wrong. The  <br />only songs that stuck with me after listening to it were Nobody's Home and the style of Slipped Away. The rest I didn't even care if I heard them again or not. Actually, I'd rather not. <br /> <br />In a time when there are not many voices there you can sing to if you're not the kind of person with a Hip-Hop type voice, this CD is good because it's something you can try to replicate without sounding slutty like with Britney or something. But if there were a version without lyrics, it would be better because then you could stylize your rendition of the songs. So, from a singer's stand point, I would just recommend downloading Don't Tell Me, My Happy Ending, and Nobody's Home off of the internet, or get their singles. You won't miss out on much.
0783225733|4.0|Apollo 13 is a well cast and extremely well directed movie that tells the story of one of NASA's finest hours. Even though the actual outcome is well known, the movie provides dramatic tension as the Apollo 13 crew and the people at mission control work their way through a most remarkable life threatening situation. The cast is outstanding, with Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon and Gary Sinise all giving wonderful performances. For me Ed Harris as Mission Control director Gene Kranz just about steals the movie. He is just incredibly good in this role , possibly his finest hour on screen.<br /><br />It is easy to take the technical aspects of this film for granted because they are so realistic and presented in almost documentary form but the effects and the atmosphere aboard the space capsule and lunar landing craft are extraordinary.<br /><br />This is definitely a film worth owning and one I pull off the shelf now and then and always enjoy viewing.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day fans, rejoice. This album is a one-of-a-kind, spectacular showcase of the band's versatility and talent. American Idiot is both very similar to and yet completely unlike any of Green Day's previous albums. In this fantastic \\"Tommy\\"-like epic, Billie Joe, Tre Cool, and Mike Dirnt show that they can still pump out rockin' pop-punk tunes; yet they also exhibit their softer side - without betraying their politically-charged punk rock roots.  <br />This album tells the sad story of our post-September 11th, Bush-monarchy America (hence the title, American Idiot - it's no mystery who they're referring to). From the album cover, which features an illustration of a bleeding-heart hand grenade, to the obvious political/liberal references in the song titles and lyrics (\\"Wake Me Up When September Ends,\\" \\"Letterbomb\\"), this album shows us that Green Day is all grown up, and they've got something to prove. However, songs like \\"She's a Rebel\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Girlfriend\\" show that they still know how to have fun, too.  <br />I adore this album. If you're a Green Day fan (or a Bush critic), you will love it too. I recommend the explicit-lyrics version of this album, though - the clean version loses something in translation that just can't be replaced.
1400049628|3.0|The Zombie Survival Guide is very funny. The first half of the book had me in tears because of the author's satirical and witty sense of humor. This is a book that pretends to be serious about a possible zombie upheaval and it is surprisingly well researched, as if the author had spent many many hours looking at zombie movies in order to decide which escape plan would be best, which kind of gun should be use, and what to do in case of total annihilation. <br /> <br />Still, near the half mark, the book loses steam. And fast. I found myself skipping the last part of the book, which describes the different \\"reported\\" zombie attacks throughout history. That whole section (nearly 100 pages) is redundant and very repetitive. None of it was actually funny, or very interesting.  <br /> <br />The book is recommended for its actual field guide section. What to do if zombies attack? Well, this book will answer this question and then some. Everything from food, to the types of guns and weapons best suited to fight these monsters, to the different types of possible attacks (according to the author, there are three), all of it is covered in depth and in a very funny manner. <br /> <br />I had a love-hate relationship with this book. Although it did make me laugh on numerous occasions, I was still slightly disappointed in the end. Read the first half, then skip the rest...
B00005JMEW|5.0|this is without a doubt in my mind, one of the best films every made, Seriously, there is nothing in this film that doesnt appeal to the ethnics of an awesome film. The film is mind blowing.  <br /> <br />Now i mean no disrespect or harm, but if you dont buy this film you are either a fool or very very boring.
0671042858|5.0|This book has so many components that make it a great book. For one, like most Stephen King books it is well written. It is written in such a way that you want to put it down because its so scary but you can't stop reading it. King sucks you in like a vacuum and wont spit you out until the end. It's also written in a way that you can understand what's going on and you do not get confused. Also the content of the book is amazing. It's a perfect example of a perfectly written novel. The book brings something so true to writing and makes you realize how a poor choice can lead to a life threatening adventure. It tells you the story of a little girl's survival and the mistakes she made on the way. This prepares you for whenever a journey like this is thrown your way. It also goes to show that your mind can either help you or hurt you by explaining how she imagined the baseball player Tom Gordon to survive and she dreamt of a wasp king in which scared her. I love how realistic the book is and there are so many things to just come along and tick you off. It is just like you're in the girl's place. When she's hungry you feel hungry, when she's scared you become scared, and when she made mistakes you wish you could turn back the page and redo what she did wrong.  This is a book I will gladly read time after, after time. Almost the whole book keeps you in suspense and has a surprise ending you would never suspect. I recommend this book to anybody who is looking for a suspenseful book full of adventure that they cannot put down.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I'm telling you, Avril is still rockin'!!!! I'm so impress <br />Avril is still my favorite ofcourse!!!!!!! <br />Take Me Away- One of my favorite rock song <br />Together- My favorite rock song in this cd <br />Don't Tell Me- WOW <br />He Wasn't- Reminds me about this jerk <br />How Does It Feel- very special song <br />My Happy Ending- My favorite song ever <br />Nobody's Home- Catchy song, love the chorus <br />Forgotten- Rock <br />Who Knows- I don't like it that much but I kinda like the lyrics <br />Fall To Pieces- I really want to \\"Sit and Stare at him.\\" <br />Freak Out- Love it <br />Slipped Away- sad song
0316172324|2.0|the book began with lots of interesting observations and new ideas, really eye catching so to speak but after a couple of chapters, it is the same thesis rehashed many times with different stories to illustrate the same concept(s). i thought the writer could have done a magazine feature article on this topic instead of writing a full length book. so, definitely borrow the book from the public library as you can finish the whole book in 2 hours. on content alone, this book does not deserve a \\"buy\\" but deserve a \\"borrow\\".
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is soooooooo talented!!!!!!!

B00005JN2Z|4.0|Collateral is a thriller/drama in which Max (Foxx), a lonely taxi cab driver, finds himself an accomplice and a victim to Vincent's (Cruise) drug cartel-contracted murders.  Max's first fare of the evening, a beautiful Annie (Smith), renders his guard down allowing the next passenger, Vincent, to enter his clean-taxi world.  Vincent offers him a cool $600 if he will take him to five stops throughout the course of the night.  <br /> <br />When Vincent carries out his first contract of the evening, sending the body smashing into Max's car, Max is so overwhelmed by the reality of what just happened that he could only do exactly what Vincent wants him to do, thus initializing the remaining events of the evening.  Max realizes he has to do exactly as Vincent requests when he tries for help and gets two somewhat innocent people killed in the process.   <br /> <br />Max, an intelligent man with aspirations of living on a tropical island, quickly gains self-composure and begins to think about the best way to remove himself from this situation.  Max bonds with Vincent on some level, and Max even has to portray Vincent to the drug cartel in one scene. <br /> <br />The movie comes full circle, as the last hit of the night is no other than the luscious Annie, whom Max felt feelings of warmth toward earlier in the evening. <br /> <br />If you are part of the millions who always loved Cruise as the good guy, then you will have overwhelming feelings of confusion to see him portraying this murdering, non-feeling, hit man.  Foxx puts on an excellent performance opposite to Cruise, and is a natural in this serious role. <br />
6305074364|5.0|Kathy Bates won the 1990 Best Actress Academy Award for her outstanding performance in this movie. In addition, James Caan was excellent in this movie as the object of Kathy Bates' psychotic obsession. This is a great movie - a heart-stopping psychological thriller. This is a quality adaption of a Stephen King novel. The movie differs quite a bit from the novel, but I believe it differs in ways that make it a better movie.<br /><br />Rob Reiner directed this scary movie. It is a suspenseful thriller. The storyline is fantastic because, even though it is very scary and not predictable, the viewer has the feeling that the events in the movie could really happen.
B00008S2VG|5.0|It has been said that the we get better with age.  Of course it all depends on how we age.  It would seem down right silly or pathetic to imagine a 40ish woman still writting songs like Material Girl.  We expect our pop stars to remain ageless, almost lifeless.  Once you grow older, especially for women, they base judgment on looks, staying power and relevance.  It is easier, and true to remain a pop Icon as a man, but women get harsh criticisms.  Some of these pop Icons are now parodies of there former selves and glories.  Cher is a prime example.  Although she has stated that she is done with touring or music, thank god, she never was at the level of Madonna.  Madonna is a woman, man and person of her own making.  To have surpassed the so called pop princesses of the world, Paula Abdul another clinger on with American Idol looks pathetic, and remained relevant is not easy.  Janet Jackson is another one who seems to get more immature as time goes on.  I know it's a review of an album, so here it goes.  I don't want the artist's that I am a fan of to grow tired or repetetive.  Madonna has created a special personal album about love and life.  Things were overblown by the now notoriuos video, but underneath the controversy lies a mature album.  I don't think it is album to be played at a club or dance parties, and thank goodness for that.  She is a mother of two, married and going into her golden age.  I for one love this album.  It is a better album than Music, and very coherent.  It did take balls to rap about her life in the title track but it wasn't meant to be serious.  It was satire, but the general public is too judgemental to see that.  Nothing Fails is a gorgeous love ballad and Easy Ride is a testament to her life and the road she wished for herself and children. It is this maturity that I connected to.  Let's see if Brit, Christina, Jessica, or even Janet could match the level of complexity Madonna has.  I don't think that album deserved t o be panned as it was.  For all the b*llsh*t music released by the current pop brigade, it is comforting to know that a woman that started out rolling on floor singing like a Virgin can now sing about life as a whole.
0767834739|3.0|As a huge fan of the original games I came to the first Resident Evil movie with fairly large expectations.  Was I disappointed, a little.  As a horror movie it had its moments, as a movie based on a game it wasn't very great.  Although, to lend it some credit, Paul Anderson has said it was more of a prequel to the games rather than based exactly on the games.   <br /> <br />Luckily Resident Evil: Apocalypse is based on the games and is a lot better done than the first one. First off, there's a lot more action. To me the first one was far to slow, with not much going on. This one was almost pure action through and through. It had great gun fights and well thought out fisticuffs.   <br /> <br />It also played out like the games, with different scenes from the game actually in the movie, which I enjoyed. The Tyrant was well done and didn't look too cheesy like I thought it would.  The zombies were good, although the moments where the director chose to slow down the film to show groups of zombies moving was a total waste.  I couldn't help but think, \\"cheesy TV movie\\" during those times.  The dogs and lickers were well done, and there's nothing like a creepy classroom filled with zombie children to get some chills wrung out.   <br /> <br />Milla Jovavich's character Alice was a big improvement too.  Jovavich had a better grasp of the character this time around and played her with some good old camp too.  She seemed more confident in the role, which worked for the movie.   <br /> <br />My only real complaints about the movie where its lack of constant good scares, only one new addition of the monsters from the game(the Tyrant) and lack of gore. For a horror zombie movie you'd expect a little more gore.  Even Shaun of the Dead has more gore than this. But overall, it's a step above the original, and a gigantic leap over other zombie movies based off games.  Yeah, I'm talking about you House of the Dead.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|I remember sitting in the theater watching this movie called Dancer in the Dark.  I didn't know what to expect, but I new the journey the movie was taking me on was full of raw emotion.  Polarizing, yes, but to me, it was heartbreaking.  Yet within all this sadness lies a terrific musical.  But this is in the context of Selma's mind, when the reality is too much, she dances and sings in her own darkness.  This is her joy, this is the musical she has dreamed of.  Continuously drifting from reality to deal with the tragedies of life, her music sweeps from the big musical numbers Cvalda and In the Musicals to the gentle sweetness of I've Seen it All.  But since I saw the movie numerous times, the song that stays in my mind is New World.  I admit to being the biggest baby, but it almost brings me to tears everytime I listen to it.  Why, because of the ending?  In musicals there are usually fantasy endings, like in 42nd Street, but in the reality of the cruel world, when you have been cast as the tragic heroine, one could only imagine her demise.  The songs appear here differently than in the movie.  But that does hinder that fact that it is wonderful peice of work.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|All I ever heard about this movie was how funny it was. Somehow, from all the people I talked too, no one decided to mention that buried beneath the comedy and romance, lay an extremely well crafted horror movie.  <br /> <br />The movie is extremely funny in a British way, like a new generation of Monty Python. Its played wacky at some moments and serious, but really funny, at other times.  And it's this balance between the two that make this movie as funny as it is. The movie is also a nice homage to past George Romero zombie films, which I really enjoyed because I'm a big fan of that whole trilogy.   <br /> <br />The movie centers on Shaun, a lay about slacker and his friend who is an even bigger slacker and one of those guys that most people just don't like.  Shaun has a girlfriend, whose tired of always going to the same pub, and fed up with hanging out with Shaun's same friend. She ends their relationship and the next day the country is overrun with zombies.  Now Shaun and his friend are on the run, trying to save his ex-girlfriend as well as his mum and stepdad who he's not to fond of.   <br /> <br />Hilarity ensues as arguements over which old records should be used as weapons and where they should go after rescuing everyone.  And what better place to go than the local pub.   <br /> <br />As everyone gathers together the movie takes on the feel of Night of the Living Dead with everybody in the group not getting along so well.  Shaun becomes an unlikely hero all while trying to protect his mum and win back his girl.  The violence and gore in the movie was something that suprised me, albeit, a very welcome surpise. But its the reason the movie worked so well.  It was able to so finely walk the line between good horror movie, great comedy and winning romance all wrapped into one nice little package.   <br /> <br />Another welcome return is the walking zombies.  I don't mind the running ones, from last years Dawn of the Dead remake or 28 Days Later(although I would be more inclined to argue that they weren't really zombies, just people hopped up on a disease that caused rage, but whatever), but I grew up on the walking zombies and find them to be a little bit more scary.   <br /> <br />All and all, a great horror comedy with decent DVD extras.
B000667KWO|3.0|As others have said, I too do not understand the slating this movie has received.  It may be a good thing though, as I went in to this with very low expectations and ended up being pleasantly surprised.<br />The effects are up to the par, and the acting is as good as any super-hero movie.  The story/plot are a little weak, but I don't see how it could be improved either, as even the comic stories are not their strong point.<br />Halle Berry looks excellent in this, either in her 'plain' side (Patience Philips), or as her alter-ego (Catwoman), and I defy anybody not to appreciate her black leather outfit! ;)  The sets are good, and the supporting roles round out the movie well.  Sharon Stone puts in another good 'Baddy' turn.<br />All in all, go into this expecting 90 minutes of deep, meaningful story and oscar winning acting, and you will hate it.  Rather just expect pure escapism and fun and you won't be dissapointed - you may even enjoy it.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|A modern-day Homer, Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) has always been a teller of tales about his astonishing life as a younger man (Ewan McGregor). Going back and forth in time, director Tim Burton takes a dip into the realms of realism and fairy tales revealing the life of a man who never wanted to be a big fish in a little pond. Edward's penchant for adventure takes him from his small hometown in the deep South, around the world, and then back again. Along the way he meets a witch with a magical glass eye, a hungry giant, jumping spiders, conjoined twins, a playful werewolf, and many more characters, including his future wife. Animal lovers are privy to an unprecedented big top act of acrobatics combining the talents of lions, bears, elephants, ponies, pigs, dogs, and a death-defying housecat who ascends nearly 30 feet in the air on a platform and leaps, landing perfectly on-target onto a satin pillow. (No special effects here: The real cat learned to jump from as much as 70 feet, and had been performing the stunt for seven years prior to being cast in Big Fish.) Based upon a novel by Daniel Wallace.<br /><br />Staci Layne Wilson
B00005JMXX|5.0|I am surprised to see so many bad reviews on this movie. Maybe because this could really happen someday? I don't know but I absolutely LOVED this movie. It really kept me on the edge of my seat. VERY GOOD!!!
0395595118|1.0|I've read the LOTR just about yearly since I was in 7th grade, and I bought this edition because I liked the illustrations and because my older boxed set has nearly flamed out.  I still love the story, but this edition is terrible.  The kaolin paper is shiny which makes any book difficult to read comfortably; in this edition, the ink used varies in color from medium to dark grey--it rarely ever approaches black--and is unevenly applied, so the reduced contrast combines with the shiny paper to make this a most uncomfortable read for extended sessions.  This is more of a nitpick possibly than a complaint, but the line spacing is also too wide.  Finally, throughout the work there are occasionally smudges or lines of text that have smeared or slipped.  On balance, I have rarely encountered any more physically awkward and aesthetically disappointing volumes, and recommend strongly to all comers that you get the separate volume of Alan Lee illustrations and find yourself a hardback edition printed on 'normal' paper for your actual reading copy.  What a disappointing way to spend eighty bucks.
B00012QKSI|5.0|Has all of the songs I loved from the movie.  Hearing each track bring flashbacks of the appropriate scenes.  Since I've willingly watched the movie 20+ times in the last 3 months, listening to the CD is the next best thing to watching the movie when I'm unable to.  Simply put, if you like/love the movie, you'll like/love the soundtrack.
B000083LQB|1.0|But I won't be buying it. I'm a huge Sonic Youth fan, but I find it absurd that they want to charge me $30 for a CD that I've already bought. I'm not blaming the band here, though I'm sure that they deserve some of the credit. This is an RIAA problem. They didn't make enough money off me the first time, so why not try to get just a little bit more. And they wonder why people pirate music. This \\"deluxe reissue\\" thing seems to be all the rage right now. Sony has done the same thing with the Clash's London Calling, and Matador has done it with Pavement's Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain. But only Matador has reissued the CD at a reasonable price. Yet more evidence that the only CD's you should buy come from Indie labels.
B000268QB2|5.0|I bought the single about two years ago for This is the Last Time released by the label Fierce Panda, I hope that is the right name, for 99 cents at Tower.  I didn't know who they were, but thought that for that cheap of an import single, I should at least give them a try.  I loved the song, but found out there was no album.  I bought a few more copies for Holiday gifts and everyone loved the single.  I found out more information and discovered that Hopes and Fears was in the works.  I bought a few copies the day of the release for $6.99, but obvioulsy it is worth much more.  The sweet tender voice, very man child like and the subtle instrumentations make this album good for listening at anytime of the day.  I listened to it with my boyfriend when we drove up to Haleakula crater in Maui.   It is beautiful and well produced.  The lyrics are very sincere and innocent at the same time.   Now if only they would tour more in the US, that would be super.  For now, I will be content with owning this little gem of an album.
B00028HBL6|3.0|This movie is too much about the screenwriters interpretation of religion and their obsession with violence and not enough about the glorious creative & loving God of our world. There is only one God of our world, the creator. Yet, there are hundreds of man-made church organizations. Looking back through history one will see that the conflicts of man-made ideologies are a major source of war and other types of violence. We do not need this type of violent movie to have faith in our God.<br /><br />A movie composed of violence is exploitative of its viewers. There are no exceptions. Violence breeds evil and should not be depicted in any excess just for storytelling.
B000696PWC|4.0|Kylie Minogue's re-emergence early in the decade after a couple of poorly received albums in the mid to late nineties seemed to surprise every single critic that had counted the Aussie pop dynamo out, and America seemed even more surprised when she crossed back stateside with the indestructible \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" in 2002.  In an attempt to bring her career up to date, another compilation surfaces, with her new millenium output added to her previous stash of Stock Aitken Waterman hits.  Thus, ULTIMATE KYLIE takes up not one but two cds, all the more to take maximum advantage of compact disc space, but unfortunately fails to take advantage of the \\"ultimate\\" tag on the album title as there are several singles not present. Among the missing in action-\\"Finer Feeling\\" and the very underrated \\"Some Kind Of Bliss\\"(the best track off the IMPOSSIBLE PRINCESS album and ironically her lowest charting solo single ever).  Those two omissions become even more sad when you look at some of what was included(granted they were more successful chartwise)--the dreadful \\"Tears On My Pillow\\"(proof that just about anything with Kylie's name on it can eke out a #1 ranking), the almost equally horrid Latin-inspired pastiche \\"Please Stay\\", and the \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" clone \\"Come Into My World\\". Still, three middling tracks do not a bad album make, and when you consider that \\"Hand On My Heart\\", \\"Step Back In Time\\", \\"Spinning Around\\" and \\"Slow\\" are here(just to name four brilliant pop records), the complaints are almost petty.  Add to that the inclusion of the very classic-sounding \\"I Believe In You\\" and \\"Giving You Up\\" and you've got another world class package from one of pop's most enduring icons.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Who is this guy who keeps writing all these terrible 1-star reviews for this film (it's the same person, by the way, and he's obsessed with Reba McIntire if you check his \\"other\\" reviews).<br /><br />I'm not sure what some people are expecting from \\"Citizen Kane\\" --lots of CGI explosions, and graphic, on-camera deaths?<br /><br />No, this film is not over-rated, nor is it boring. It may be too ponderous for some tastes, and that's fine, but it really IS one of the greatest classics in film history: aside from breaking every rule of cinema storytelling up until that time (the episodic format jumps back and forth in time, a style not really re-ignited in movies until the '90s) but moved significantly forward in terms of camera-work... Yes, younger viewers might not recognize these things today, but the story (loosely based on the life of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst--- Patty's granddaddy) is a sweeping portrait/satire of super-wealth at the beginning of the 20th century.<br />Too liesurely paced for some audiences, but if you're prepared for that, it's otherwise absolutely gripping.<br /><br />If someone wants to blame AFI for putting a film on their \\"Best 100\\" list from 1997, save it for REAL pulp like, say, \\"Pulp Fiction\\" (yuck!)
B0001VWP8I|4.0|Anastacia latest offering shows that she can sing anything, anything at all.  With her first two cds she drew comparison to Taylor Dayne, Martha Wash or Chaka Khan, but with this one she comes close to Tina Turner or Joyce Kennedy.  This cd like any great work has you finding something more everytime you refer to it.  I like the fact that Anastacia continues to take risks by exploring different musical grounds in this case more hard rock instead of staying in a musical comfort zone.  All of the songs are great, so no filler here & the all have deep stories that lye within them.  Y'all go out and get this one! <br /> <br />
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I can't believe that even the Amazon.com reviewer thinks that Muse is a ripoff of Radiohead. They wouldn't even fall into the same music cathegory!! (what if Bellamy's singing style is similar to Yorke's?? Almost every guitar player uses distortion and that doesn't mean all bands are a ripoff of the first distorioned-guitars-band).    What we have here is power-alternative-rock. If there is a clear influence in this music, it is more likely to be the Smashing Pumpkins than Radiohead. Here we have rage, tenderness, catchy tunes, great solos that don't get boring, the use of instruments in very effective (and imaginative)ways, and many more things that I'd rather let you discover for yoursef. The fact that this is one of the best sounding live bands of all time (get the DVD, if you ever wanted to play in a band, you will hate these guys) doesn't hurt either...    If you like epic, pretentious rock, this album is a must. It surely doesn't discover the wheel but, then again, which album does??    Oh, I should also add that you should get Origin of Symmetry too. Is a more straightforward-in-your-face kind of album, and has great songs too.

0385510454|4.0|The views about Grisham's writing range across a broad continuum. Some folks only like books such as \\"The Firm\\" and \\"The Pelican Brief,\\"--real page turners that the reader simply cannot put down. It is hard to argue with this viewpoint given that \\"The Firm\\" is probably the best suspense novel I ever have read. Others, however, point to his best work as those insightful novels which focus upon various facets of the legal profession, such as \\"The King of Torts\\" or \\"The Client.\\"  Others were delighted,as was I, with the humorous side Grisham unleased in \\"Skipping Christmas.\\"  It is hard to fit \\"The Broker\\" into any of these categories. It is not a page turner, in fact it drags badly in spots, although things do pick up toward the end.  It does not really deal with the legal profession, although the lead character is, as it happens, a disbarred convicted lawyer. And it certainly is not a work of humor (unless you consider Grisham's multiple references to \\"Red China\\").  What it does represent, however, is a long-developing trend in Grisham's writing--the development and honing of his skills as a novelist, able to skillfully develop a storyline, write realistic dialogue, and bring things to a satisfying conclusion.  Michael Crichton, please take note!  By any measure, this is not his best book--but he once again demonstrates his ability to \\"spin a yarn\\" in a most effective manner. The reader may not love this book to death, but it would be next to impossible not to enjoy it.
B00005JNEI|3.0|I'm giving this film 3 stars overall, but I would like to emphasize that I give the Iraq portion of the movie 5 stars. The 911 portion of the film in the beginning is substandard and inadequate. I recommend that you watch this film for the Iraqi War piece, it is engaging and tragic. But if you want a more thorough account of the open questions on 911, I would check out 911- The Road To Tyranny by Alex Jones.
0790729628|1.0|I bought the directors cut knowing it was different than the original, but it had been so long since I had seen the original I really couldn't figure out what was different. I looked at the box and saw that the narration had been taken out. What were they thinking?!? That is key to the movie! I agree without the narration it makes the directors cut pretty much a whole new movie, but to me, a movie very much lacking in depth. You go along for the ride not really knowing exactly what is going on except for the fact that you have seen the original so you are already clued in. It's like watching a movie with the volume turned off half the time. Boo for the director's cut. Release the original on DVD ...... please.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Hello all, <br />I received this CD for Christmas, and I absolutely LOVE it! Its a fantastic blend of her recent releases (UP!,Party for Two (with Billy Carrington AND Mark McGrath), as well as many of her older songs. Listen carefully at the end of 'No one needs to know' for a little surprise voiceover. <br />
B000031WD9|1.0|Sweet Beejesuz this is one bad movie. I suppose it appeals to an age bracket oh, roughly 14 years and 1 day old to 14 years and three days old. They'd find it a riot.  If you're over 14 and still find it funny, get help imediately since you must suffer from retarded development. Y'know if George Washington had realized that his fledging state would get as desperate as this he'd have packed his bags and emigrated to Canada right then and let the British rule America. I still blame the British for starting the whole gawdawful genre with garbage like Benny Hill. Oh hee hee it's all sooooo funny!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Hi All, <br />I had the pleasure of seeing Shania's concert live in Chicago. Even though my family and I had seats pretty far back, her stage presence was phenominal! (the huge screens helped a lot too!) I'm buying this DVD to watch and remember the fantastic time we had watching one of the best female country music singers~ever! <br />A note about the music in the concert; she sang many of her songs from UP! and several of her past hits too. My 14 year old daughter was THRILLED when Shania sang several of her favorite songs, 'Rock this Country' and 'Honey I'm home'. I recommend this DVD for anyone who enjoys great country music and a fantastic concert.

B0000027F3|5.0|Let me just start off by saying that as truly great as this record is what was even greater was the statement that the band had made at the time it was released. Let us not forget that a very short time before this the band was beginning to shift in a very different direction, resulting in the albums \\"turbo\\" and \\"ram it down\\". Even though I'd have to give the band some credit to have had the guts to attract a wider audience even to the point of selling out, I for one don't buy into that whole trying to experiment with \\"different sounds\\". I think they knew exactly what they were trying to do and to their credit were successful. And honestly, especially with Rob back at the helm, it's a lot easier to say that now in 2005 then it was back in 1987. But regardless it was still a big letdown for the older fans who always knew what the Priest were really all about and still are....simply THE GREATEST HEAVY METAL BAND OF ALL TIME!!!! It was also around this critical time that thrash was beginning to reach a much wider audience. Bands such as Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer had become huge and were viewed as up and coming and the \\"true\\" metal of the time, leaving Priest somewhat in the dust. And on top of all that they had become entagled in a very contraversial court case where their music was being accused but ultimately found not guilty of causing the deaths of two teenagers. As tragic as this was the Metal Gods still didn't let anything get in the way of as K.K. Downing had put it, \\"progressing naturally\\". The result was this absolute masterpiece and landmark album which is beyond a return to form to probably the most aggressive album they've ever made!! I don't want to call it thrash but it certainly contains some of the fastest songs they've ever done, the title track being one of them. The one part of the band that I always thought could have been better was the drumming. Not that any of them were \\"bad\\" but when you hear the work Scott Travis does on this itkinda makes you think twice about the direction the band would have taken had he joined Priest maybe 4 or 5 years earlier. The guitar work is simply amazing in terms of not only speed and aggression but above all chemistry between K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton thet they hadn't exhibited since Defenders of the Faith. Vocally, Rob Halford just takes it to another level and really compliments the heavier and harder style of priest that he seems to have been comfortable with ever since. Ian Hill is as solid as ever. If you are a true metal fan you probably already have this, if not you don't know what you're missing!!!! Can't wait till their new album Angel Of Retribution!! THE PRIEST IS BACK!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> <br />

B000002KOJ|5.0|I know that Joni Mitchell's fans are divide about the relative merits of her different albums but although I love all her music, I generally prefer the early folk albums and this my favorite of the lot.<br /><br />The album opens with Tin angel, a great about finding new love but just a taster for what follows. The second song, Chelsea morning, is among the finest songs that Joni ever wrote. It is followed by another classic, I don't know where I stand, which Barbra Streisand covered for her album, Stoney end.<br /><br />More great songs follow = That song about the midway, Roses blue, The gallery, I think I understand, Songs to aging children come, The fiddle and the drum - each and every one of them a real gem.<br /><br />But, even with all those classic songs, the best is saved for last - Both sides now. With its references to clouds, this is actually the title track of the album. Legend has it that Joni rang up Judy Collins in the small hours one morning begging her to record it. Whether that is true or not, Judy certainly recorded the song and an American top ten hit with it, firmly establishing the careers of both these great ladies.<br /><br />So I'll ignore those who say that this is Joni's worst album - I regard it as her best and, of course, Joni would never have had the chance to develop her career if this and the other early albums had failed to make an impact.<br /><br />If you enjoy this album, you may also enjoy Joni's other early albums - Ladies of the canyon (featuring Woodstock and Big yellow taxi), For the roses (featurimg You turn me on I'm a radio), the untitled debut album and, of course, Blue, generally regarded as the best of these early albums - it's brilliant, but I've looked at them from both sides now and I still like Clouds best.
B00004R9A4|5.0|I saw this film as a child at Radio City Music Hall in NYC and loved it.  It's nice to know that I can now enjoy such an uplifting film from my childhood with my two children.  My little one loves the mixture of animation, and my son loves the scene of the armor coming to life.  I would highly recommend this film.
B000002G89|5.0|Eric was in various blues-rock groups, notably the Yardbirds and Cream, before embarking on a solo career, during which he recorded many excellent albums. This is one of the best, if not the best of the lot. It includes I shot the sheriff, a British top ten hit that topped the American charts, as well as many other outstanding songs.<br /><br />The album features Yvonne Elliman (best known for her Saturday night fever hit, If I can't have you) on backing vocals. She provides great support for Eric on this album, especially on Let it grow, my favorite song here after I shot the sheriff (on which Yvonne also sings). Eric and Yvonne co-wrote Get ready and sing it as a duet.<br /><br />The album opens with a traditional song, Motherless children, and closes with a song that Eric wrote about himself, Give me strength. Both of them are great songs, as are all the songs in between.<br /><br />The musicians are in top form throughout on this classic blues-rock album. If you are a fan of classic rock music and haven't already got this album, what are you waiting for?

B000002UA0|4.0|I can't stand Pink Floyd. Lame \\"art as rock\\" band (hey guys, only Velvet Underground can suceed in doing that), thank god they broke recently. The only Floyd album I like (and in fact I love it) is their debut with Syd Barret, the legendary \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\". Films are often refered to as cult classics, but I don't hear albums being called that title enough, but this album is truly a cult classic. \\"Lucifer Sam\\", \\"Take thy Stethoscope and Walk\\", \\"Matilda Mother\\", and \\"Bike\\" are the best Syd songs. This album is by far his masterpeice. Forget the fact its by Pink Floyd, this is a different Pink Floyd.
B0002OOUP0|4.0|A Christmas gift that was gratefully received, gave way to mild disappointment at the reproduction and sound quality on this CD. I have still rated it at 4 stars for the material, and great stuff it is too. If you are new to the Stones, or just rediscovering them, herein is a nice slice of the varied range of Mick & the Boys, from the sultry Brown Sugar, right up to the streetwise boot tapping of Undercover of Night. Oh dear though at the tinny and at times sibilant recordings - these may be remastered originals, but they should have been better with the amount of technology available today. Setting my system to a top heavy bass, dropped mid range and subtle treble was the only way that I could enjoy this without feeling it was being slaughtered, and most preset surround settings on my all in one system didn't help either. I actually still have some original vinyls that sound better, and that's a shame. Overall though, a nice package at a good price, just don't expect too much if using a small or inexpensive music system.
1400032717|5.0|I just love this book! The way Haddon captures Christopher's way of thinking and behaving is unbelieveable. It made me appreciate what a \\"normal\\" human being is!<br /><br />The narrator is Christopher, a 15 year old autistic British boy. He wants to solve the mystery of the neighbor's dog that he discovered dead. His path to reveal the killer, takes him to another reality that he couldn't comprehend.<br /><br />I could never have imagined how autistic people think, but this story takes you into the minds of one in a simple and clear way that made me sometimes laugh, others cry, not because it is a sad story- it is- but because this kid just couldn't grasp what is so obvious and just copuldn't see the truth. While you as a reader can realize what is going to happen, yet you wait for Christopher to face the truth at his pace.<br /><br />It left a great impression on me, while we take everything for granted, when others can't even enjoy a hug!
B0006213WG|5.0|\\"Chuck\\" is an evolution for Sum 41. They've matured as songwriters. It starts off with the melodic chorus of \\"No Reason\\" and ends with \\"88\\", which begins with three minutes of pounding guitars and ends with a soft breakdown. In between, you'll find \\"Angels With Dirty Faces\\" one of their best songs on this CD and one of their heaviest ever. Then you strike gold with \\"Pieces\\" which is one of the most well written songs of 2004. This CD is a must have for anyone who likes punk or alternative rock.
0446677450|5.0|Great book, People don't wanna be stuck in the rat race forever...this book teaches you how to think about money wisely, and instead of working for money, make money work for you.  I know this book has changed my perception about money and it will help me throughout life. read this book..age does not matter, Robert T. Keyosaki makes it very simple.
B0006IIPIK|1.0|How can this movie go wrong? Great Cast and great look...well I saw this movie in theathers and I must say it was the biggest dissapointment EVER. Story is very dry and the all star cast are put to shame by cheesy one liners and a scribt that takes way to long to get into the plot of the movie. I wanted so bad to walk out of the theather, but I waited and hoped that things would get better. But all the cool parts that are seen in the trailer are shown in the first 15 minutes and the story completely changes gears in the third act of the scribt.  I am beggin you to save your $20 and purchase a movie that you will enjoy instead of being dissapointed with SKy Captain
0060589272|5.0|I loved this book! <br />It is a 22-year old womans journey into the world of sex and her quest to find someone who will show her its meaning in the context of love. <br />I usually underline the parts that I love in each book I read; I was not able to do so with this one because most of it would be underlined. I especially liked the main characters diary excerpts after each chapter; they were so powerfol and honest. <br />It is a very easy read and it keeps you turning the pages till the end.A very simple book full of wisdom.
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|This movie got a lot of bad reviews. A LOT!! Needless to say, I was suspicious about whether I should rent it or not. I'm so glad I did! This movie did not deserve those bad revies. Not at all. The cinematography is awesome and so is the acting. Brad Pitt did an awesome job as Achilles and Eric Bana was superb. I love Hector throughout this movie. He was awesome and then he went and died. I was crying, I admit it. I also loved Achilles. The only character I didn't like was Paris. I love Orlando Bloom and he did a good job acting, but I didn't like his character. I respect that all the actors also did all their own fighting. Ultimately, this has to be my favorite movie. I salute the actors.
0446677450|1.0|this book is full of \\"fluff\\", anecdotal stories stretched out into full chapters that exploit greed and fear of the reader to ultimiately promote the \\"Cashflow 101/202\\" games, (monopoly-like spin-off), which are very expensive.  if you get rid of the fluff, the bottom line is: invest in stock options, bonds, notes and real estate.  this book was written in 1998, during the golden years of dot-com startups, (before they had to actually turn a profit).  it doesn't tell you anything about what they are, just that they are a good investment, while buying a house or getting an education is a bad investment.  to learn how to actually put this in practice, you have to buy a game, which comes with audio tapes or video tapes and cost 100's of dollars.  the book claims it is revolutionary, but it isn't.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Moving evening with George his friends (except Bob Dylan).    After a few interesting songs from India, the show really took off.    First, some very silly and naughty humour of the Pythons (mooning at the Albert Hall!): like George his production of Pythons' \\"Life of Brian\\", some reviewers apparently do not share (t)his British sense of humour...    Next, a moving, brilliant and fluent performance; the evening's 5+ star highlights came from Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, Joe Brown and Billy Preston in \\"Is it not a pity\\", \\"For you blue\\", \\"Something\\", \\"While my guitar gently weeps\\", \\"Wah wah\\" and \\"I'll see you in my dreams\\". The evening was directed excellently by Clapton and it showed that the perfoming artists had a profound respect for the composer and its songs.    Amazing how beautiful a concert movie can be: highly recommended!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|i agree with one of the other reviewers, in that i was never really a big slipknot fan either. and the came vol. 3. this in my opion is the best album to come along in a very long time. and all of you people that said slipknot sold out you are wrong. go buy this album now.

B00064MW6K|5.0|I really liked this movie. it was very entertaining the action was great, and the casting was great.  sure, it dosent have the best plot ever, but it is a fun movie.  you should at least rent it.
B00000099Y|3.0|The actual song tracks on this album are very impressive and interesting to listen to but as the rest of the album,  <br /> <br />well all those interludes are meant to make the album sound like a piece of art as a whole but really its totally pointless for people who have got nothing better to do than listen to quirky rubbish. <br /> <br />Anyway, musically brilliant and quite dark sounding but full of nonsense and bollix!
0316666343|4.0|This was a crazy book. I liked it at most parts but others were just a little boring and confusing. I fealt that thisbook was really terrifying. I think any book about rape is scary. I have rea dothers but the way it was described in this book was really deep and scary. I love how it was made that the vistum was watching from up above in heaven. I also liked how heaven is the way you want it to be, the way you want to see it. Reading about what the family had to go through with her death was also very interesting. I read the pain the mother weant through till the point when she could no longer take it and left the house altogether. Some parts made me cry like when the motehr left. It was hauntingly funny too. The jokes were on a different level then my usual sense of humor, so I had to think a little bit extra to get them. I am glad I read this book. As usual almost all books I read teach me a lesson. I thought this one was one of the very best. I loved reading about the girls life to what her friends and family went through with her death. A very good read indeed.
B0000027RL|3.0|What a terrible boring album, that seems to drag endlessly. <br /> <br />Some impressive moments \\"Even Flow\\" \\"Black\\" and \\"Once\\" but the rest is just unbeleivably boring. Although their are some great guitar solos. <br />Pearl Jam are no lonnger the long haired young aggressive nutcases they once were and have gone on to make real music such as \\"Binural\\" and  \\"Riot Act\\". <br /> <br />To be honest I think those albums are musically brilliant and have real charcter rather than their first two albums which slide nicely into that dreadful \\"made up\\" category which has a slapt on title on it to pin it down as \\"Grunge\\". <br /> <br />The only thing I could call Grunge which actually sounds like grunge is Silverchairs \\"Frogstomp\\" and Soundgardens \\"Bad motot finger\\". Enough said.
B00005JNEI|4.0|i don't think anyone is going to refer to michael moore as being impartial or dead-pan in his moviemaking style.  keep in mind that this movie is no more emotionally manipulative than a bush campaign commercial; it just hits you in a different way.  the fact that someone out there finally had the gumption to let out a loud, unforgiving, blustery scream for accountability in the halls of power is what's most admirable here. <br /> <br />contrary to popular belief, the bold faced lies that the self-righteous right likes to rant and rave about are few and far between in this movie.  there is emotionally manipulative footage, yes.  but emotional manipulation is what it takes to get people to change their minds, even if it's for their own good.  it would be easy to make a clean, objective documentary about the dismal failure that is the bush administration; heck, the facts sure are there.  sadly, the vast majority of americans can't be bothered with that or drawing their own conclusions and as such, the bush campaign was very effective this fall as it relied on many of the same tactics as michael moore's movie.  john kerry and the democratic campaign played it safe and avoided character assasination, exaggeration, under-the-table sponsorship of \\"non-partisan\\" activist groups and all the other bullsh*t the RNC has down to a fine art and they lost, obviously.  if it's never been crystal-clear before, it is in this day and age: now is not the time for subtlety.  despite all this, the case made against bush amidst all of the unnecessary footage is about as solid as you can get.  check out michael moore's website for a blow-by-blow factual backup of every last claim in this movie including sources.  even i was surprised at the amount of fact-checking that went into it.  zell miller's speech at the republican national convention had more truth stretching in it than this movie by a long shot. <br /> <br />make no mistake about it, fahrenheit 9/11 hits you at a gut, visceral level. it does not shy away from the full-on carnage and gore of the iraq war when most news cameras would cut away.  this movie is simply fighting fire with fire; there are no opposing viewpoints in it at all because the same tactics are being utilized by the republican party to try to convert people although there are many, many more lies necessary to make their case.  it only makes sense that the right wing would hate this movie with all of its fury seeing as to how it was released during a pivotal election year.  calling it an attempt to slander the president is a cop-out; a weak answer to such a stunning piece of art as well as telling commentary on the direction of the political winds of our time.  there is no slander in this movie.  everything that appears in fahrenheit 9/11 is real and sums up the post-9/11 world that we live in today. there's no need for him to make a damn thing up; it's happening right in front of our eyes.   <br /> <br />no matter how you slice it, michael moore is only doing what any concerned american would do.  blind acceptance and trust in any administration has and always will mark the downfall of a free people.  if you love michael moore, if you hate michael moore, or if you just don't know yet, you owe it to yourself to see this movie.  it received standing ovations in my home (and very red) state of north carolina, and that says a lot.  the endless, brain-dead blather about michael moore being unpatriotic or un-american has to stop.  this is america; it is our job to preserve the good name and legacy of her for future generations.  this movie just might be the first baby step toward achievement of that goal.
B000068QY7|2.0|What ever happened to the songs!!! <br />Oasis's first two albums are amazing as well as the \\"masterplan\\" that has some brilliant acoustic songs. <br /> <br />Even Be Here Now (which is ridiculously loud and blown out of proportion) and Standing On The Shoulder of giants (Which has some great moments) are far better and more pleasurable to lsiten to than this. <br /> <br />\\"The Hindu Times\\" \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" \\"Little By Little\\" \\"Born On a Different Cloud\\" heak their are some great tunes on this album, they are just way to polished up and overly produced. It really spoilt some great songs. <br /> <br />Dreadul album.
B000002H5I|5.0|Whatever happened to the true artists in music today? <br /> <br />with Ashley Simpson and Boybands it seems that the heart and essance is going more and more.  <br />it's great to retreate to a album which is heartfull, genuine and stil and always be a clessic.  <br />alot of people put down Tracy Chapman because people think that she sounds like a man. this is also where comercial music is making it's rise. not al music has to have a catcht tune with a skinny bimbo flaunting herself to sell albums. It's the heart of the music and lyrics.  <br />People instantly groan at the sound of her voice.  <br />To those peole take note of er lyrics and tru;y understand where she is going with her songs and you likeevery one of her fans will realise that she is one of a kind.
B0006399FS|2.0|I was really looking forward to this album. <br />Before it came out U2 were saying  <br />\\"It is a real rock record, our first one, its what the real U2 sound like\\" and the few others that had heard it before it was released were saying  <br /> <br />\\"Its the best record that they have made, it sounds like the earliear u2 updated\\" quite oviously stateing that this album was gonna be a very \\"real\\" down to earth and more a rocking U2 than ever before, with a track with  <br /> <br />\\"every track that matters\\" (Bono) <br /> <br />In fact, I took their word for it. Why would'nt I? <br />I know how amazing U2's music is, and the way that they have progressed with each album is just brilliant. <br /> <br />\\"POP\\" (for all you dislikers of it) being the most rockiest and best sounding U2 album out of all of them, thankyou very much. <br /> <br />But when I heard \\"Vertigo\\" for the first time, I was like eh? <br />Well its alright, but its not exactly a very down to earth song. <br />Gibberish lyrics and the video clip is just terrible and rather ridiculous to be honest with you. All those spinning and dizzying effects? I just don't know. <br /> <br />This album, is not very straight forawrd sounding, their are no straight forward songs, and they all seem to have the same soundscape as each other, which gives you the feeling that this is a very commercialised album - and I spose in a way it is. <br /> <br />It pleases the masses of people who will buy any old thing to make up their CD collection, or whatever happens to be popular, which is not what \\"real\\" music is about. <br /> <br />Do I reccmend you buy this, er no I don't. <br />Its better on the whole I guess than their previous album  <br />(All That You Can't Leave Behind), although that album does actually have better songs such as  \\"Walk On\\" \\"Kite\\" and \\"When I Look At the World\\". <br /> <br />As far as I'm concerned the last U2 album that really matters is \\"POP\\". After that musically the band have just become far tomainstream and safe sounding.  <br />\\"YOU GOTTA GIVE IT AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!\\" U2 because at 46 you can't be who you once were after two albums that fall short of who you really are as a band. <br /> <br />U2 are a modern rock band, and to think they still will be doing this at the age of 50 is laughable. <br />
0385510454|5.0|I am not going into the details of the plot of the book, that has been done enough by other readers, but I will say that I enjoyed this book so much. I am a big John Grisham fan from way back, and I have to admit his earlier books are my favorites. I have not really enjoyed his later ones very much.....but I really, really enjoyed this one. It is fast, interesting, and fun. I liked the character and could not put the book down, I wanted to know the ending. So welcome back Mr. Grisham. To any potential readers out there, go for it, I think you will enjoy it.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Sigur Ros isn't really like anything you've heard before.  Having said that, in a sense there is some mild similarity to the Cocteau Twins, who utilize vocals in a made-up language as another instrument, rather than as words per se.  The songs are extraordinarily melodic.  This album is not \\"different\\" in the sense that it is discordant or difficult to listen to; on the contrary, melody is at the center here.<br /><br />Once \\"Agaetis Byrjun\\" gets in your head, it's very hard to get out.  The first time you listen, you may find yourself scratching your head, wondering if you really liked it or not.  But after you hear Agaetis a few times, you will find it difficult to get this CD out of your player.  Songs like Staralfur (\\"staring elf\\"!) will stick with you to the point where you'll start humming them at odd times and thinking about learning Icelandic.<br /><br />Buy it now and you won't regret it.  Thanks to Amazon for being one of the only places in the U.S. to get this great CD.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This is quite simply one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.  What is all the fuss about?  It's one of those movies that you continue to watch hoping that the 65 minutes you have already invested will reveal some hilarious 'splash' ending.  It never comes.  Lame.
0671027387|4.0|Deception Point is somewhat predictable (after reading The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons).  There are some plot points that throw you off the trail and leave you wondering.  And it is because of these little surprises that I gave the book 4 stars.  Dan Brown has his own style of writing and each book follows his formula.  The stories are all very similar so if you don't like one, you'll hate them all. This story is more political as it deals with NASA, the president, and the NRO.<br /><br />A giant meteorite is discovered under ice in the Arctic region.  It contains a secret that could undermine science and religion...
0316172324|4.0|This is not as good as The Tipping Point.  Having said that, it is very much worth reading.  Today's world requires that we make important decisions quickly.  The total quality management movement has lead to an over-emphasis/reliance on data and the important notion of gut feel has been diminished.  We often don't have time to research exhaustively.  However, even when we do, the initial feel of something is critical. <br /> <br />Gladwell draws on social psychology to help us understand the biases we bring to decision making.  He also helps us understand that our capacity to quickly size someting up accurately is a gift we'd do well to recognize and appreciate.   <br /> <br />If you live a life where you have to make choices, read this book.
B00000K19E|5.0|OK, so it's not a ninja movie. Even though the only way these people fight hand-to-hand is through oriental fighting styles. Be that as it may, this film blew everyone away the summer of 1999, myself included. Granted, it took several viewings to get the whole thing figured, but that's alright. A story like this doesn't come along very often, and the mind-blowing visual effects are worth watching again and again and again. Keanu Reeves really doesn't have to do much here, other than fight judo-style, but he really doesn't have to. Laurence Fishbune is fantastic as Morpheus, the leader of the human resistance. Carrie-Anne Moss is a knock-out in her role as Trinity, the love interest for Neo(Reeves), and a real tough chick in her own fights. This film began the Matrix trilogy, and is easily the best of the three. It can stand apart from the other two, as it was originally meant to be a one shot deal. Personally, that's how I think of this film : as a stand-alone achievement. Not many movies this day and age make people go \\"huh?\\" and think about things the way this one did. Any DVD collection should include this fine film.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|It had been three years since the release of Mer de Noms, which seemed to be one of the biggest selling albums this side of college radio (and mall-based record stores). Now, A Perfect Circle finally resurrected with Thirteenth Step. But this album came amidst a slight change in the lineup, as the band now features members formerly from Marilyn Manson, Tool and the Smashing Pumpkins.<br /><br />Speaking of the Pumpkins, it seems that they and A Perfect Circle are somewhat connected, as this album was also released amidst quarreling between former and current band members. Sounds confusing? Well, Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan blasted former guitarist James Iha for breaking up the band, and James is now the guitarist for A Perfect Circle. Circle's Billy Howerdel then retaliated, calling Corgan \\"sick\\" in an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times. Meanwhile, Corgan put together a new band, Zwan, featuring guitarist Paz Lenchantin, who used to be in A Perfect Circle. Sounds MORE confusing?<br /><br />Now on to the album. The new lineup doesn't do anything to change the sound of the music. But don't think that's a bad thing. There are plenty of good songs on here, like \\"Weak and Powerless\\", \\"The Outsider\\", and my favorite song, \\"Blue\\". There are also some songs on here that make you think, especially shown by the lyrics in \\"The Noose\\". And the production in \\"The Package\\" can't be denied.<br /><br />Some of the songs toward the end of the album start to lose a little steam (except for \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\"). But this is still an above-average album. It may not be as good as their last, but you still won't have to worry about tripping on the thirteenth step.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000001IPL|5.0|It's sad to see what The Offspring has become lately.  With their album Americana, they plunged into popular music hell and have managed to sink lower since then, as impossible as that sounds.  But before \\"Pretty Fly for a White Guy,\\" and \\"Original Prankster,\\" and their entire album Splinter, The Offsprring was a great band, just punk enough to be punk, but with a broad appeal.  Need proof?  How about their album Smash, easily one of the best albums of the 90's.  <br /> <br />Without Smash, all you little poser punk rockers out there wouldn't have your precious AFI and Good Charlotte to listen to.  Same with Sum 41, A New Found Glory...the list goes on and on.  All the pussy punk on the radio these days owes its success to two albums: Smash, and Dookie, the immortal Green Day album.   <br /> <br />I read once that Smash is the best-selling independent album of all time.  I believe it.  This album is incredibly replayable.  Every song is worth listening to, and they're all pretty good.  Of course, we've all heard the radio hits, but some of the deep cuts on this album are nearly perfect.  Check out \\"Genocide,\\" \\"Smash,\\" and \\"Bad Habit.\\"  This is intelligent, raw, energetic punk at its best.  The band hadn't \\"sold out\\" yet, so go ahead you poser punks, enjoy it.   <br /> <br />One more comment, I saw the Offspring in December of '03 at a crappy little club in Salt Lake City, right before they released Splinter.  I only paid about 15 bucks for the ticket, but I was pretty sure it was going to be a crappy promotional tour.  I was wrong.  The concert was incredible. Probably the best show I've ever been to.  The crowd was out of control. People were hanging from the lights, diving off balconies, doing stage dives. It was wet and wild fun.  And they didn't do any of usual concert crap, like tell jokes, say how hot the girls are, or say how awesome the city is.  They got on the stage and played their old stuff.  Only one new song.  It was like a full body massage.  Yes, theband is old and their newer music sucks, but wow, they can still put on a great show.  Trust me.
B00000K0DT|4.0|Strong language - and lots of it. <br />Other than that, an excellent film. <br />You don't have to like Mob movies to enjoy this film. <br />The plot/director/writers lead you around from surprise to surprise without your knowledge and even against your will. <br />After the first few twists, I decided to really pay attention and STILL they got me! <br />Very enjoyable. <br />
1400043662|3.0|Murakami is at the point in his career where we can speak of \\"vintage\\" Murakami, and this has many of the familiar traits that will make it successful and a engaging read: two narratives that begin as unrelated and slowly converge, magic realistic elements leavening the story, an elemental role given to music (and its evaluation) as part of characters' awakening, and of course an enthralling narrative. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, it just doesn't come together--or better put, Murakami hasn't resolved many of the novel's dangling issues that may make novel writing a bit tedious but ultimately endow the work with rewarding coherence. <br /> <br />I'll try not to be tedious myself, but here are a few of the major questions that are never addressed, let alone resolved.  The novel is governed by a father's Oedipal curse upon his son, which 15-yr-old Kafka  runs away from home to escape. Kafka \\"seems\\" to fulfill the curse, but we never know whether it is the realm of dreams (or an alternative reality), or in some way real. For example, he wakes up with blood soaking him the night of his father's murder, but Nakata seems to have been the killer who entered a fairy-tale world where he kills Johnny Walker,  a demon who represents the monster patriarch (though we're not told how or why the elder Tamura takes this form). Needless to say, we never learn who killed Tamura in the conventional world. Likewise, Kafka \\"seems\\" to sleep with his sister (part of the curse) and a woman who may or may not be a lover from a past life or his mother--we never know. After all this cosmic transgression and ritual pollution we would expect some fallout for the oedipal lad, but the novel's ending drops the whole topic without attempting to either demonstrate how Kafka outwitted fate or that his father uttered a false curse as part of his plan to torment his son, who he may resent. <br /> <br />Confused? Well, there are problems galore: Nakata's a great character--perhaps the work's most endearing--but what exactly happened to him sixty years earlier as a child to restructure his mind? Was that distant plane that  immobilized a group of school children really a plane? We're meant to strongly suspect not, but we're never told what it in fact was and how it transformed Nakata. Likewise, the novel's seminal scene may involve the metaphysical completion of Nakata and Miss Saeki, which allows her the spiritual release from memories that plague her, but why is Nakata the vehicle and how does he \\"restore what's here now to the way it should be\\"? In terms of the novel's logic, we're never told what his connection to her is, or why \\"the entrance stone\\" has opened for him to cure her and how that affects Kafka. <br /> <br />It's frustrating: I am a genuine fan of Murakami's work, and even recommend this novel with considerable qualification (I'm sure that's obvious by now), but it falls short of such past accomplishments as \\"Hard-Boiled Wonderland and ...\\" or \\"Wind-up Bird Chronicle,\\" though it is significantly better than \\"Dance, Dance, Dance.\\" <br /> <br />
B000056HE9|3.0|Nice little plot with very good performances by all the lead parts. <br />A cozy way to spend the afternoon with TBW and a bowl of popcorn. <br />No special effects to speak of. <br />Deals with religious questions without beating you over the head. <br />Good film for young adults to see.
0446677450|5.0|While some authors will tout their get-rich-quick schemes, others will argue that great wealth is only created through diversified investments and time.  In this first volume of the ever-growing \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" saga, author Robert Kiyosaki lays the groundwork for his unique philosophy of achieving financial freedom through the eyes of himself as a nine-year-old boy.  Living on the \\"poor side of town\\", young Robert struggles with the vastly different financial beliefs of his own father (Poor Dad) and those of his best friend's father (Rich Dad). <br /> <br />Despite his Ph.D. from a top university and a secure government career with a considerable salary, Robert's real father struggled financially for his whole life.  Caught in what Kiyosaki describes as the \\"Rat Race\\", he lived within his means, but considered the purchase of a house his greatest asset, and had few other investments.   <br /> <br />Although dropping out of school in the eighth grade, Rich Dad became one of the wealthiest men in Hawaii.  It is from this perspective that Kiyosaki executes his plan for financial freedom and writes about his journey from the \\"Rat Race\\" to the financial \\"Fast Track\\".   <br /> <br />Calling upon six fundamental lessons, Kiyosaki introduces the reader to the fundamentals of accounting, including the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow analysis.  In doing so, particular emphasis is given to the \\"typical\\" cash-flow patterns of the poor, middle-class, and rich.  Refreshingly, simple diagrams are used without complicated jargon and over-analysis.  Simplicity is key - Kiyosaki defines an asset as \\"something that puts money in my pocket\\", and a liability as \\"something that takes money out of my pocket\\".   <br /> <br />With this framework, the Rich Dad lessons often break with traditional economic thinking.  Kiyosaki contends that while the rich acquire assets, the poor and middle class acquire liabilities, often thinking they are assets.  Fancy cars, a dream home,and expensive vacations are all \\"doodads\\" according to Rich Dad, unless the passive income from existing assets more than offsets those purchases.  Rather than working hard for money, the rich let money work hard for them.   <br /> <br />Considerable thought is given to providing the reader with a strong foundation of financial literacy, something Kiyosaki contends is not taught in school, wherein students are penalized for making mistakes.  Among the rich, success typically follows after failure, analysis, and trying again.  Among the middle-class and poor, the fear of losing stymies even the attempt.   <br /> <br />Kiyosaki provides motivational support, but also practical advice, by discussing the tax advantages of incorporation, and the fundamental difference between financial independence and freedom.  Using diagrams, he explains how banks and creditors get rich at the expense of the consumer, despite offerings of \\"no-money down\\" or other \\"low-interest\\" gimmicks.   <br /> <br />With insightful commentary on how Rich Dad's percept ion of money was so vastly different than his own highly-educated father, Kiyosaki dispels commonly held myths of the poor and middle-class.  No matter how smart you think you are, \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" is a must read. <br /> <br />Joshua A. Gerlick
B00006I9HJ|5.0|this cd from beginning to end is brilliant, from the lyrics on Paper Boat to the music of Blizzard of 77... <br /> <br />I have to strongly dissagree with Ziggy Stardusts review when he quotes Interpol as great lyricists... <br /> <br />first off, \\"her stories are boring, AND STUFF, she's always calling my bluff\\" <br /> <br />yeah THATS an original one... <br /> <br />anyways, from a fellow new yorker to another...listen to paper boats next time you are riding the subway and don't tell me you don't feel anything, cause if you don't you need to get some sunlight and calm down on the interpol (one of my favorite bands btw)
B00005JNBQ|3.0|I have actually been to Preston, Idaho.  It is an examplar of many small rural towns in the western United States.  It shows a great geek in action.<br /><br />This movie is a lot like \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\".  The after conversation and interminable quoting of the movie is a lot funnier than the actual movie.  But it is not first-rate comedy.  I think the polarized responses of either loving the movie or hating it are representative of this kind of movie.  It belongs in the deadpan hall of fame along with the Holy Grail and It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.
B00020HEG6|5.0|To all the John Williams fans out there, you know that Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban is a much different approach of how Williams usually scores for movies. This CD captured me from the moment I listened to it! What makes this soundtrack so unique from the previous two movies is that this one does not rely so much (barely at all) on the repetitive themes throughout each track. Each track almost tells a different story for the listener. Now visualize the entire movie's storyboard just listening....very unique. Prisoner of Azkaban had a new director and filmed it in a similar but fresh approach compared to Chris Columbus. John Williams has performed the same task with this soundtrack. I let you decide on what the pieces mean to you but the three tracks that stood out the most were the \\"Knight's Bus\\" which was so jazzy, contemporary, and upbeat and just forced me to listen to it at least two more times before I could continue with the rest of the CD, \\"Buckbeak\\" which has a different melodic progression than on \\"The Chamber of Secrets\\" this track was orchestrated beautifully with lush strings and a gorgeous climax which makes me feel like I am flying over the mountains and clouds, and last is \\"Patronus\\" (sorry for any spelling errors?) this is simple but yet so mysterious and free. The voices just make time stand still-Kudos to the Boys London School Oratory. You can feel the rush of power as Harry stops the dementors from getting to him and Sirius. As for the rest of the tracks, they all were orchestrated without the reoccuring themes over and over which made me have to listen precisely to every second that was composed. I personally enjoyed listening to this soundtrack as well as every other soundtrack that John Williams has done.
079073639X|1.0|I, like most teenage boys in America, went through a certain stage in my teen years. It is an icky developmental thing that few people like to talk about. It may really be better left behind closed doors.<br /><br />Still, I find myself oddly compelled to share this shameful part of my youth in a public setting:<br /><br />Once upon a time, I too read a lot of Michael Crichton.<br /><br />Of his somewhat vacuous oeuvre, I always thought that Sphere would make the best movie. Unfortunately, most movies come from Hollywood--and we all know where the heads of most Hollywood executives spend most of their time.<br /><br />Samuel Jackson? Maybe.<br /><br />But Dustbin Hoffman??? Sharon Stone?????<br /><br />Oy Vey.<br /><br />I'd rather watch Congo. At least it had Laura Linney to look at.<br /><br />This movie is trash--and in this case (as compared to Crichton's novels) I am using that word in a bad sense.<br /><br />Don't waste your time.
B00008S2VG|1.0|There are far, far better singers out there than madonna. I haven't listened to her music since the 80's. I lost interest and moved on to much more talented vocalists. She looks too weird now anyway. I don't know what kind of plastic surgeon she uses, but he should get his money back. Norah Jones and Annie Lennox were simply incredible at the Tsunami Benefit concert this past saturday...They are Great talents.
B000002J0N|5.0|THE BAND: David Crosby (vocals, guitar), Stephen Stills (vocals, guitar, timbales), Graham Nash (vocals, piano), and several studio musicians including - George Perry (bass), Tim Drummond (bass), Gerald Johnson (bass), Jimmy Haslip (bass), Joe Vitale (organ, flute, drums), Russ Kunkel (drums).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1977) 12 tracks clocking in at just over 44 minutes. Digitally remastered and re-released in 1994. Included with the disc is a 6-page booklet containing song titles/times/credits, song lyrics, and thank you's. Label - Atlantic.<br /><br />COMMENTS: I found this CSN disc from 1977 somewhat hard to find in the local stores. This crisply remastered disc replaces my old vinyl album with all its snaps/crackles/pops. The acoustic guitars and drums/hi-hat/cymbols sound like they were recorded yesterday. CSN's harmony remains legendary. The drug induced folk/pop/lite-FM masters of layed back rock achieve gold on this reunion album. \\"Deja Vu\\" was my first album of CSN(Y)'s back in the early 1970's and it's still my sentimental favorite. 1972 found the band all but together. Solo projects followed their break up - but, never achieved (in my opinion) the success or craftmanship that CSN could produce as a whole. Neil Young was briefly part of the group, but as good as some of his songs were with Crosby/Stills/Nash, I still felt like he was on the outside looking in. Not a bad thing - I think some of Neil Young's work with (his) Crazy Horse is brilliant. \\"CSN\\" spawned 4 worthy hits with \\"Fair Game\\", \\"Cathedral\\", \\"Just A Song Before I Go\\", and my all-time favorite song of theirs \\"Dark Star\\". \\"CSN\\" also had 3 beautiful piano ballads in \\"Carried Away\\", \\"Anything At All\\", and \\"Cold Rain\\". The acoustic numbers \\"See The Changes\\" and \\"In My Dreams\\" (about Crosby's drug addiction) are both top notch. Lastly, there are 2 deeper tracks - both in the rock mode that are hidden gems... \\"Run From Tears\\" and the last track on the disc \\"I Give You Give Blind\\" (my favorite non-hit song here). Not a weak track to be found (5 stars).weak track to be found (5 stars).
B00003CXPJ|5.0|No one but Ben Stiller could have pulled this one off, along with fellow crazy comedians who also have no shame, Jerry Stiller (Ben's real life father), Will Farrell, Owen Wilson, and Christine Taylor (Ben's real life wife...who so successfully brought Marsha Brady back to the screen).  Their zaniness feeds off each other, creating a truly stupendously dumb movie.  Of course, dumb in a good way.<br /><br />It's like watching a streaming line of `dumb' jokes, one right after the other, all put together in a silly story that manages to hold itself together, thanks to the comedic genius of Ben Stiller.  Look for the stellar supporting roles from David Duchovny, Milla Jovovich, and Jon Voight, along with Cameos by too many famous faces to mention.<br /><br />Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is a male model, recently beat out of his crown of \\"Male Actor/Model of the Year\\" by Hansel (Owen Wilson).  He takes a job from Mugatu (Will Ferrell), who is a famous fashion designer known for exploiting the third world labor force, in order to model his latest design line, `Derelicte'.  But Mugatu has plans to use Derek to kill the Malaysian Prime Minister, and brainwashes Derek to complete his mission.  Reporter Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor) figures out what Mugatu and his assistant Katinka (Milla Jovovich) are up to, and sets out to save Derek.<br /><br />This movie is absolutely hilarious, a dizzying glimpse into a truly vapid mind, with visual jokes aplenty peppering the zany dialogue.  Cell phones, pageants, coal mining, funerals, gasoline frolicking, patented \\"looks\\", hairstyles, day spas (check out Andy Dick as Olga the Masseuse, this scene is worth the price of the movie itself!), there is nothing too sacred for this movie to make fun of.<br /><br />If you are looking for a ridiculous vacation from reality, sit down and give Zoolander a watch.  Warning, this movie may cause stupidity.  Enjoy!
B000001FY9|5.0|Pick this one up for the car and pick up either the extended or the CD/combo pack for home. Pick up \\"Natural Mystic\\" (which is more or less \\"Legend II\\") once you find yourself singing these songs in your sleep. Then pick up \\"Live\\" and \\"Babylon By Bus\\" to hear how amazing they were in a live setting. Pick up all the Island/Tuff Gong-era releases and the \\"Songs of Freedom\\" box set which covers a lot of territory. The pre-Island era material (Soul Rebels is actually their first album although there are an almost infinite number of compilations of Bob's 60s era output) is a lot more difficult to go through, but still enjoyable.  <br /> <br />What's to say that hasn't been said?

B00000I8UJ|4.0|Clocking in around 37 minutes (and no alternate takes/previously unreleased stuff), this isn't one of the longest RVGs you'll ever buy, but it certainly is a great one! I too am a bit dismayed at seeing this one panned as \\"diet jazz\\". Following too closely to the melody line seems an odd criticism for this disc, to me. Dexter is melodic as all (!!!!), but they are his own melodies, spiraling out of his horn on the spot. He isn't just riffing on the \\"head melody\\" over and over again. Not even close. His melodic invention here is actually quite fantastic... from masterfully placed (and played with) quotes, to just straight-up building out from the starting point. As far as I am concerned, this disc is easily one of the main reasons that Dexter Gordon is a tenor legend.<br /><br />Based on previous reviews, Cheese Cake seems to be the big hit here but the two tracks that really take the cake for me are Love For Sale and Three O'Clock in the Morning. This Love For Sale is a giant. One of my favorites. One of the biggest disappointments of this disc is that there aren't one or two alternate takes of Love For Sale included here. Of course the reasoning is understandable. If this was the first take then there was no reason for any one in attendance (band, producer, engineer) to think a 2nd take was needed, as this first one is a masterpiece.<br /><br />It is indeed true that if you're in the market for one of the more \\"progressive\\" Blue Notes along the lines of Out To Lunch or Fuchsia Swing Song or Contours, this may not be for you at this very minute. This isn't blazing any new trails, punching down any walls and letting a whole new world view shine in through the cracks. Nope. This is just killin', hard-swinging, straight-ahead bop by the top-notch band of Dexter, Sonny Clark, Butch Warren, and Billy Higgins. Dexter's tone and absolute mastery of the art of melodic improvisation are on full display here.<br /><br />Did I mention that the sound on this one is excellent, too? I have to mention that I didn't have any pre-RVG versions of this though, so I don't know to what degree the sound is improved. I just know I love what I have.<br /><br />At this stage in his life, this wasn't a guy thinking he should still be trying to change the world, but he most certainly was a guy who could tell some amazing melodic stories with his horn. When I say that, don't be thinking this is museum jazz played by a guy doing the same thing he'd been doing for 20 years! You'll notice that Dexter had indeed absorbed some of the newer things that the younger generation of tenor players were doing... and he uses them to great effect. If you're a jazz fan and you can afford it, there is no reason why this disc shouldn't be in your collection.lent, too?

1400079179|2.0|The writing is perhaps the only redeeming quality of this book, although there are certain areas that are interesting.  Brown's pace is very fast, but this can be kind of irritating at times because every single chapter ends in kind of a cliff hanger.  Nothing rarely gets resolved without something else happening, leaving a never ending string of chapters that irritate you more than entertain.<br /><br />Another major problem I have with this book is his usage of history.  Sure, it is a historical fiction and the author takes certain liberties, but does that mean he should change history to support his novel?  I would say no.  The history should act as a catalyst and the story written around it, yet Brown distorts and changes the history to his story.  This was the defining reason why The Da Vinci Code was not a good book in my eyes.  Angels & Demons was a much better book because it was written well and it incorporated itself into the history really well.<br /><br />A fast, okay read that distorts history.  I would not recommend.<br /><br />2 stars.
B00008PC2O|5.0|Once the bad guy, T mondel 101 cyborg(Arnold Schwarzenegger) is now the good guy helping John Conor(Edward Furlong), and Sarah Conor(Linda Hamilton) escape the wrath of the new model T-1000(Robert Patric)  And man this guy is one baaad dude, I'm talkin' get in his way, and he'll shove his arm right through you(SERIOUSLY!)<br /><br />This was John Cameron's second to last good film(True Lies) befor he went to direct the Titanic, a crappy soap opera that shoulda sank like the ship.  Well anyway enough about that, this was James Camron's best film so far.(He coulda made Terminator 3 everything it shoulda been, but NOO he and Linda Hamilton go there seprete ways and he won't direct it.  He still coulda directed it tho!)<br /><br />Special Effects are crazy, and high budget material.  Seeing a man made of liquid metal, go through things, regenerate, and get holes in him every time he got shot, is pretty freakin' amazing.  I mean the special effects were something thats still looks good today, even after 14 years.<br /><br />Arnold being the good guy was just like whoa, ok this isn't what I was expecting, I was expecting for him to get payback, but hey beggers can't be chosers, but T-1000 was just the perfect machine, 800X better than the terminatrix in Terminator 3 which was composed of liquid metal and machinery.  That's retarted.  Liquid Metal is nealy invincable, but with macheniery inside it can easily be destroyed.  I gotta stop, cuz this is not a review for Terminator 3.  Anyway, Robert Patrick's performance was great, but it would have been cool to see Sylvester Stallone as him.  2 terminators, 2 of hollywoods bigest macho actors Jam packed in 1 freakin' movie.<br /><br />This movie surpasses the 1st in just so many ways, it's almost a perfect improvment!  Anyone interested in Sci-Fi had to have sceene this.  Anyone who usally hates dissapointing sequals ex. Matrix Reloaded, this will nearly make you forget about the first one.<br /><br />Peace
B00062RBOA|5.0|All of the recent Kleiber DVD releases are simply the best! If you enjoy listening and watching orchestral concerts and enjoy watching a conductor at work during performance - there are simply no better performances on DVD.  Kleiber was one of the greats and you can see and hear why on these treasures.  If you are at all thinking of purchasing any of the Kleiber DVD's don't hesitate - well worth it at twice the price.  My highest possible recommendation! Why Universal Music did you wait so long to release these on DVD?
B0006399FS|3.0|Few will dispute U2's place in rock history.  They are a great band, live and recorded, and they've created memorable, stirring music.  That said, \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\" is not one of their best.<br /><br />The clunky title gives one the impression that this is going to be another wake-up call for apathetic listeners, like \\"War.\\"  It opens promisingly; \\"Vertigo\\" harkens back to \\"Boy\\" with its sharp, crunchy guitar work (The Edge has never sounded better), Bono's soaring vocals, and energetic sound overall.  Thanks to Apple, everyone knows the chorus by heart, but it's one of those U2 songs that will remain in your head for days.  Out of the first five songs, the two that stand out besides \\"Vertigo\\" are \\"Love And Peace Or Else\\" and \\"City of Blinding Lights.\\"  \\"Love And Peace\\" combines a big, swinging beat with spiritual lyrics; it's a soulful juxtaposition of sex and salvation.  \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" is just beautiful.  There's no other way to describe it; listening to it will give you wings faster than Red Bull.<br /><br />Unfortunately, other cuts suffer from mawkish lyrics and uninspired (for U2) music.  \\"Miracle Drug\\" and \\"All Because Of You\\" are treacly.  While Bono's sentiment has led to some beautiful work (\\"Bad\\" and \\"Two Hearts Beat As One,\\" for example), it doesn't cut it here.  \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" and \\"Yahweh\\" are good, but after making the so-so \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind,\\" U2 should be aiming for great.  \\"Original Of The Species\\" is just a muddled mess; I can't tell if Bono's talking to the love of his life or a child.  And even though I listened to the CD for the twentieth time this month just this morning, I can't tell you what \\"One Step Closer\\" sounds like.<br /><br />U2's worst is still better than many bands' best, so \\"How To Dismantle . . .\\" shares case space alongside \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" and \\"October.\\"  But I hope that for the next album, the boys get in the mood to make heart-ripping music again--and that they cut any title suggestion longer than three words.hat they cut any title suggestion longer than three words. <br />
B0002Y4T92|5.0|I saw pieces of this concert on PBS, and decided to purchase it.  The DVD contains many performances that were not aired by PBS, and is a real treat for musicians and fans alike.  The performances are varied, but no trash or filler.  The one tune by Stave Vai and his band is fantastic, and worth the cost of the DVD alone. <br />For those who got to see it in person, this festival must have been a once in a lifetime experience.  Wish I'd seen it live! <br />Buy it.
B0000041DF|5.0|Whenever I listen to another recording of Rachmaninoff's concerto (and trust me, I've got plenty - Horowitz, about 3 copies of Ashkenazy...), I always wonder why the 3rd movement is so slow. It's because I've listened to my favorite of them all, this recording, so many times that it's spoiled me. Only Rachmaninoff himself plays the piece faster, and he tends to miss notes (the sound quality is also terrible). <br /> <br />The first movement's not the best I've ever heard (Horowitz's rendition is the best so far), but the 2nd and 3rd movements really shine. The Tchaikovsky is also very good. However, Argerich does play very fast (although her 3rd movement is slower than Rachmaninoff's own recording), so she does miss notes (especially in the 1st movement of the Tchaikovsky). Nonetheless, this is the best recording overall of the Rachmaninoff, and one of the best of the Tchaikovsky.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Many people have been complaining about the minor changes in this dvd set. I just wanted to make it clear that the song in the finale of Return of the Jedi was changed 8 years ago, when the Special Edition versions of the trilogy came out. The extended scenes in that finale were also in the SE version. George Lucas brought Star Wars to us, in my opinion, that gives him every right to make changes to these movies. If you are a fan, this set should be invading your dvd player as we speak.
B00004SVID|5.0|This is one of the best live cd sets from Pink Floyd or any band. The Wall was my favorite album and this deserves to be heard by anyone that's a fan of rock or any kind of music. It sounds perfect, just like the album. They don't miss one thing from the album in each song, for some there's even more music such as longer guitar solos by one of the best guitarists ever (David Gilmour). This is about 20 minutes longer then the regular album, which was 80 minutes long. There are 30 tracks all together including 2 tracks that are just the master of ceremonies talking to the crowd.  <br /> <br />One thing I loved about The Wall album and this live set is Roger Waters lyrics/vocals that made it so good. He is a really good singer and is the best of the best. His lyrics describe a lot of sad and serious situations and are sung on every track to make one of the best vocal performances ever. He even plays the acoustic guitar very well especially in a couple of the songs including one of my favorite songs Mother.  <br /> <br />Even though the keyboard wasn't used really at all on this cd, Richard Wright is still one of the best keyboardists as that heard on the album Dark Side of the Moon/Animals/Wish You Were Here, which are all great albums too.  <br /> <br />The drumming by Nick Mason is awesome. Just look at his drum set in the book, it's huge. Its really is great with Roger singing and David Gilmour's guitar solos played along with it.  <br /> <br />Gilmour's best solo on here as everyone knows is on the song Comfortably Numb that is about 1 minutes longer then the album version. If you want his best solo for Comfortably Numb buy the cd Pulse. He is one of my favorite guitar players for his awesome style of playing.  <br /> <br />TRACK RATING: <br /> <br />DISC 1 <br />1.Master of Ceremonies- (1:13)-10/10 <br />2.In the Flesh? - (3:00)-10/10 <br />3.The Thin Ice- (2:49)-10/10 <br />4.Another Brick In the Wall- (4:12)-10/10 <br />5.Happiest Days of Our Lives- (1:39)-10/10<br />6.Another Brick In the Wall- (6:19)-10/10 <br />7.Mother- (7:54)-10/10 <br />8.Goodbye Blue Sky- (3:14)-10/10 <br />9.Empty Spaces- (2:14)-10/10 <br />10.What Shall We Do Now? - (1:40)-10/10 <br />11.Young Lust- (5:16)-10/10 <br />12.One of My Turns- (3:41)-10/10 <br />13.Don't Leave Me Now- (4:07)-10/10 <br />14.Another Brick In the Wall- (1:15)-10/10 <br />15.The Last Few Bricks- (3:25)-10/10 <br />16.Goodbye Cruel World- (1:41)-10/10 <br />DISC 2 <br />1.Hey You- (4:55)-10/10 <br />2.Is There Anybody Out There?- (3:09)-10/10 <br />3.Nobody Home- (3:15)-10/10 <br />4.Vera- (1:27)-10/10 <br />5.Bring the Boys Back Home- (1:20)-10/10 <br />6.Comfortably Numb- (7:26)-10/10 <br />7.The Show Must Go On- (2:34)-10/10 <br />8.Master of Ceremonies- (: 37)-10/10 <br />9.In the Flesh- (4:22)-10/10 <br />10.Run Like Hell- (7:05)-10/10 <br />11.Waiting for the Worms- (4:13)-10/10 <br />12.Stop- (: 32)-10/10 <br />13.The Trial- (6:01)-10/10 <br />14.Outside the Wall- (4:28)-10/10 <br /> <br />PROS: <br />-One of the best live cd's ever <br />-2 Discs, 30 tracks <br />-20 Minutes longer then album version <br />-Great vocals/guitar/drums <br />-Awesome guitar solos <br /> <br />CONS: <br />-Would have been even better on DVD <br />-Should have included the song When the Tigers Broke Free <br />-Kind of expensive
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I don't think random garbage thrown in films is funny.  It really has no plot and I don't get the humor of the movie.  Oohh, Napoleon has a pet llama, hahaha!  I don't think so.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|Este album representa ademas de todo lo bueno que ya sabiamos de Dave, en sus anteriores trabajos con su banda, y en las composiciones que tuvo junto a Metallica, el definitivo paso al \\"Monte del Olimpo\\" para esta banda y para el mismo. El genero musical en cuanto a velocidad decae con relacion a sus albumes anteriores, pero no pierde furia ni agresividad, los riff de guitarras son inspiradisimos, especialmente en Skin o' mt teeth, Simphony of destruction y Architecture of Agression (mi favorito), y la reedicion con los demos aporta cosas interesantes, por ejemplo me gusta mas que el original el demo de Countdown... <br />En resumen, Creativo, poderoso, sublime. La combinacion perfecta de melodia y furia.  <br />Lo recomiendo ampliamente. Su siguiente trabajo; Youthanasia se le asemeja, pero este es el mejor. Es mas potente.
B0000A4GAK|4.0|This is another very good album from Butch Trucks.  This is his third or fourth album, depending on how you are counting.  It is short by CD standards, at only 42 minutes.  But, then it doesn't have any bad tracks or filler.  Sound quality is great. <br /> <br />This CD is a mixture of jazz, blues and rock.  Each track is a mixture of the 3, with a different amount of emphasis on one of the styles.  However, this CD does not have as much variation as the previous CD, Joyful Noise. Only one track is an original composition.  The rest are covers are some classic jazz and blues numbers (with a little Marley thrown in).    <br /> <br />The music has a wonderful, rich sound to it, dominated by Trucks' slide guitar.  Kofi Burbridge's flute is also featured a lot more on this CD. <br /> <br />Derek Trucks also plays for the Allman Brothers.  I hated to see them kick out Dickey Betts.  But with Trucks, the band has a new, envigorated sound.  Betts and Warren Haynes were beginning to get stale after playing together for over 10 years.  Check out some of the new Allman Brothers live albums, where the Trucks/Haynes combination has given new life to old songs.
0312955006|5.0|This book is highly recommended to fans of crime fiction/police procedurals.  Actually, in this book, you also get an interesting civil rights trial set in 1990's LA, California.  Connelly does everything right in my opinion.  He tells enough about Bosch's history so that you could start with this novel (which is by far better than his first two).  Secondly, the cop speak (police jargon) is right on.  Most importantly Connelly plots a wonderful murder mystery with several viable suspects until near the end of the book.  This book held my interest from page one, and I loved every bit of The Concrete Blonde.   <br /> <br />Connelly does so much more than weave a mystery.  His writing is very excellent.  When I read this book I felt like I was right there in L.A.  Also, the thoughts of Bosch are hilarious at times.  Harry is a very likeable and intriguing character. <br /> <br />I read the first two Bosch books, but this is the best so far as I previously stated.  For the sake of learning more about Bosch, I recommend starting at the beginning of the series.  I love the character of Bosch as much as I love the setting of 1990's L.A.  On to the next adventure of Harry Bosch.
B000001ESF|5.0|2112 is the culmination of the logical progression that was started when Neil Peart joined the band on Fly By Night.  2112 was the first cohesive musical statement that Rush made. It was here that Rush refined the progressive metal concept that would influence bands like Dream Theater, Queensryche, and many others.  The title track is a marvel of dynamics and power. The playing is tight and complex. Lifeson avoids metal cliches while creating a uniquely progressive rock guitar style.  Lee's bass is thunderous and active.  Peart's drumming mixes hyperkinetic athleticism and brute force in a way other drummers could only dream about.  All the songs are good. \\"Passage To Bangkok\\" displays locomotive riffage and a searing guitar solo. The ethereal \\"Tears\\" is a bite-size tone poem. \\"Twilight Zone\\" is a moody homage to the legendary TV show.  \\"Lessons\\" and \\"Something For Nothing\\" are strong, sophisticated hard rockers drilled home by Lifeson's blazing guitar work.   <br /> <br />2112 is a concrete refutation of the criticism of Rush as pretentious technicians with no soul or concept of \\"real rock and roll.\\" Mercury (Rush's record company) \\"suggested\\" that Rush return to the Zeppelin-derived rock of their first recording after the abysmal commercial failure of Caress Of Steel.  Instead of heeding corporate \\"suggestions\\", they made the album they wanted to make, and eventually succeeded on their own terms.  This illustrates the fact that Rush is actually more of an alternative rock band than the favorites  of the brickbat-throwing critics who criticize their \\"real rock & roll\\" credentials.
B00000IBRX|4.0|Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra star in this moving film about the depths of true love and the lengths one will go to to stay with their loved one.  Williams stars as Chris, a neurologist, and Sciorra stars as Annie, an artist.  They have a perfect life with two wondefrul children until the unthinkable happens and the children are killed in a tragic car accident.  Four years later, Annie and Chris have just begun to heal their wounds when, unfortunately, tragedy strikes again.  On a rain-slicked highway, there is a terrible car accident.  Chris stops his car and sees if he can help one of the victims when he is hit and killed by another car. <br /> <br />After his death, Chris is met by a messenger named Albert, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., who takes Chris to his own personal afterlife, which contains images from Annie's art, right down to their dreamhouse which they planned to build some day. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Annie, who has suffered through the loss of her children and now her husband, ends up taking her own life.  Due to her suicide, she is condemned to hell.  Chris, with the help of Albert, traverse heaven and hell to save Annie from an eternity of despair and trepidation. <br /> <br />I found this to be a very uplifting movie.  Williams is excellent as Chris, and Sciorra's performance as Annie is very powerful.  I enjoyed watching the transformation of both Chris and Annie throughout the film.  At the beginning, Chris was somewhat shy and reserved, but by the end, he had become much more courageous and not afraid to fight for what he wanted.  Meeanwhile, Annie went from a very happy person to a somewhat hardened person due to the loss of her children and husband.  Cuba Gooding Jr. and Max Von Sydow give excellent supporting performances. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this movie.  The acting is first rate and the message is very powerful; love knows no bounds, not even death.  Watch and enjoy a great uplifting experience.

It touches more on the coolest monsters in the Resident Evil series, the Lickers. The ending is awesome.

038572179X|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  McEwan has an amazing ability to describe the psyche and motives of all of his characters.  However, at some point for me, the novel fell short.  Perhaps it was the fact that he seemed to disregard plot in favor of character development.  It lacks fluidity in my opinion, though there seems to be something deliberate in the structure of the story.  I could feel the time the author put into the work, making it seem to be more of an excercise in writing than a telling of a story through literature.  The ending, which many people have praised, was admittedly brilliantly written: McEwan enters the mind of the 70-something year old Briony, but it seems like that's the main function of it.  I felt like he was trying to show off, or simply add a superflous post-modern element to his novel that lacked something.  All this criticism aside, I really enjoyed this book, and McEwan's attention to detail, and all of the intricacies of the novel.

B0001LJC2K|5.0|This is probably my favorite cd in my cd collection. I listen to it all the time. I love all the tracks on the cd. I especially like Stockholm Syndrome the best out of all of them tho. If you are looking for a cd to buy, This is the one to get
0783226551|5.0|This is a great movie. Its better than the first. The first one while entertaining its not Martin Scorceses version. First of all watching DeNiro play a evil man is fun and entertaining. He is downright creepy and scary in this movie. It is a total thriller if you have never seen it. I like this so much better than the original because of DeNiro's Max Cady is so much more trashy/ hateful and vile! DeNiro's accent in this movie is great and its fun to try and which you may find yourself doing after you watch it.
B00000JGHM|5.0|This is one of the few thrillers that I just cannot get enough of. I found the editing perfect: seamless but still gritty, a tensely sustained balance between the two sides of the equation, with the subplots expertly woven in and out of the main force of the film. Every time I see it I look for weaknesses or overlong pauses, but the pace is relentless and perfectly timed at every turn. Pacino and De Niro turn in classical performances as you'd expect, and De Niro's line about never getting involved with someone that you can't turn your back on in 5 minutes flat has now become part of many people's relationship vocabulary. This film has cookies for both guys & girls - action, character, intelligence and suspense both in the relationship and political realms. Even the supporting actresses defy typecasting (unlike your typical action heroes' vulnerable & fluffy wives with baby.)
B0002858YS|5.0|At least I do right now. I love the song Mr. Bright side. The whole CD is great though and it puts me in a good mood! I really like this kind of music because it does remind me of some of the 80's type stuff.
B00005QXDD|5.0|yes! this is great! its funny! AND IT ROCKS!!!!!! this cd is full of goodness
B000286RKW|4.0|Well as far as the movie itself goes it is my all time favorite. Its the best mob film ever and all the people who disagree and say the Godfather is does not appreciate the honesty of this movie. The Godfather is excellent but it is not Goodfellas. For one thing it is a true story and really exposes the sleezy side of the mob but it is also very cool. I have read Wiseguy by Nicholas Peliggi many times, from which this movie is based, but this is one instance where the movie is better than the book. Usually it is not that way. Martin Scorcese did a masterpiece in shooting this film. Just that long drawn out scene when Henry and Karen go into the restaurant the back way on their first date is just amazing because it is done in all one shot! The cast is amazing! In fact it was so amazing I guess that is why 7 of the actors have shown up in the best TV show of all time;The Sopranos, either as lead or supporting cast or extras! I can honestly say I have seen this movie well over 80 times, maybe a hundred and it is always entertaining. The dialogue, especially Joe Pesci's (Tommy) part is great. DeNiro (Jimmy the Gent) really shows why he is an all time favorite and Ray Liotta (Henry) is great as a newcomer which he was in this movie and I have always wondered why he didn't go on to great things after this. Obviously this was his role of a lifetime to date! This movie is a drama but it also has a lot of humor in it too. This movie is almost 15 years old but when you watch it you would never know it. Its so precise on detail it could have been made 6 months ago.       The way Scorcese covers all 3 decades is awesome. He gets every single detail right with clothing, sets, and cars! The soundtrack fits as well and the soundtrack is awesome too!     Now as far as the Special Edition DVD goes I really wish this DVD had a little more and now I have the original and now this as well as my OLD VHS!!  Although the picture quality is awesome and the movie will never be anything but,I think it could have been done a little better. I did enjoy the Henry Hill commentary and thats about it. The documentary where filmmakers gave their viewpoints I could care less about and the commentary with the cast is dated! All in all I rate this DVD a 4 and thats only because the movie makes up for the extras!
B0000508U6|5.0|Terrific album. Song after song of unique sound and profound lyrics. The melodies are also really soothing and relaxing. (Is that redundant?)    The style of music is really one of a kind, it's hard to assign it to a genre, but it's really beautiful. The lyrics at times are somewhat metaphorical, but nothing that will confuse the listener or anything. If you are interested in a fresh sound, then this is your album.    If you ever have a bad day, just put in this album and chill out a bit. It truly is a therapeutic experience. Just a really cool CD, and can I coin the term \\"Ear Candy?\\"    I strongly recommend this CD to everyone. It is just unbridled subliminity. Well worth the money, that's a promise.    In My Humble Opinion  John G
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Napoleon Dynamite is without doubt the dumbest movie I've seen this year. It has no plot, no climax, no story. After I saw it, I asked myself, \\"What was this movie about?\\" When you sit through an almost two hour movie and have no idea what it was about, then that might be your first clue that the movie sucks. I didn't laugh once during this movie. I don't think random jokes thrown into a movie are funny. Who cares about three losers in high school? Nothing happens to them! I don't understand the purpose of this movie, probably because it doesn't have one. If I haven't made myself clear yet, I'll summarize. This movie is stupid. Enough said.
B00008LDPU|4.0|I am surprised that people are impressed by such mediocre film like \\"Final Flight of the Osiris\\" and found \\"Matriculated\\" too abstract or boring. That's the problem man, people are just too shallow.  \\"Final Flight of the Osiris\\" is basically just Hollywood-esque plot garnered with Final Fantasy technology. Very superficial, very crappy story. Perhaps the reason why people love it so much is 'cos it almost feels like watching a Hollywood productions with the standard hero/heroine love affair nonsense.  <br /> <br />Well, on the other hand, \\"Matriculated\\" in my opinion, while not graphically superior to the aforementioned film, certainly stands out for its extremely thought provoking story line. I cannot see why people cannot make out its meaning. I'll probably shed some light on it. Human beings in this film tried to convert the robot to their side, and actually succeeded in doing so. But it is not out of empathy, but rather selfishness. Human beings simply cannot accept a robot as his own kind. When the robot(after being infused with human emotions) tried to complete the union of the souls (a healing process for the dying human girl)in the dream sequence, the human girl rather screamed and fled into oblivion, and thus leading to eternal death of the girl. What can the robot do, but stare blankly at the girl, trying to comprehend the meaning of it all? <br /> <br />The other stories range from dull to ok, but \\"Final Flight of the Osiris\\" and \\"Matriculated\\" are two polar extremes.

B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I think some people miss the point... <br /> <br />Some people give 1 star 'cos there's ONLY 10 hours of magnificent music on this dvd, but it doesn't include all the original hours, so that's terrible, really.....10 hours for 28/29 bucks, we can't have enough!!!......Well, perhaps the children who miss some portions of food should add a star to some comment here, if they could. <br /> <br />I know that we, as lucky music collectors, want to have it all, but sometimes, we should be more grateful of what we get. And that we can enjoy some wonderful dvds like this one. We didn't miss those songs because they want to take more money from us, you know.? <br /> <br />Anyway, if it just deserves 1 star (it does not, believe me ) you STILL will be helping, so that's not bad. <br />
B000001E7T|5.0|On \\"To Bring You My Love\\", PJ Harvey goes solo-solo (she was part of a three piece band on the first two releases). And the results are quite different from her past work. Most of the songs on here have a desert-blues sorta feel, fronted by lyrical imagery in the vein of a Nick Cave or Tom Waits. It's very atmospheric, largely thanks to the use of subtle synthesizer/organs in the background.     The title song brings a blusey guitar lick into the picture immediately, and the whole song is built around it. However, unlike \\"Rid Of Me\\", the slow build doesn't explode into an intense crescendo. The emphasis is now on mood rather than soft/loud dynamics.    Don't worry, there's still some heavy moments on here, such as the industrial stomp of \\"Meet Ze Monsta\\", and the swift kick in the balls that is \\"Long Snake Moan\\", a powerful rocker whose chorus will knock you off your feet.    Most of the songs on here are pretty subdued, though. For instance, PJ's vocals in the seductive \\"Working For the Man\\" are hushed the whole time, creating a dark, omnious atmosphere. The same effect is used on the tense, creepy \\"I Think I'm a Mother\\".    \\"Teclo\\" is probably the best song in PJ Harvey's catalogue; a slow burning blues ballad with some of her most frail/beautiful vocals. \\"The Dancer\\" is another one of her best compositions.     Other highlights include the folk/pop of \\"C'Mon Billy\\", the Flamenco/Spanish tinged accoustic \\"Send His Love To Me\\", and the omnious \\"Down By the Water\\", with its fuzzy bass growl.     Most of these songs will take a few listens to sink in. The melodies are subtle, and don't jump out at you immediately. But give it time; \\"To Bring You My Love\\" ranks up there as one of PJ Harvey's greatest albums, and one of the best albums of the 90's.    Best Songs: Teclo, The Dancer, Working For the Man, Long Snake Moan, I Think I'm a Mother.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Entertaining, exciting, well-acted, funny, touching, magnificent sets, real characters, a space ship that's a character in her own right, and even lots of horses!!! It's space opera done right, a space-age salute to the wonderful horse operas of the Fifties. It is hard to believe that Fox cancelled this series when shows like the last two Star Trek ventures went multi-season.     Amazon now lets us say if we have bought the item at Amazon. I have bought four or five sets of Firefly DVDs, only one of them for me. I have gifted the boxed set to other people, and each of them has loved it.  A couple of them have gone on to purchase the boxed set as a gift for others, and all of them have loved it, too. I am now a member of a nation-wide \\"Firefly\\" karass (for you Vonnegut fans out there!)    I recommend getting the movie \\"Serenity\\" as well, so you can find out how the questions brought up in the series are answered.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|I have to agree with user William Smith. The last track brought Christ's resurrection to life in such a powerful way, that I had tears streaming down my face all the way home when I first heard it!! I do disagree with his review of the other tracks- they were breathtaking. <br />I hadn't even heard of John Debney until I heard this exquisite soundtrack, so I had to come look him up. Being a huge fan since birth of John Williams, John Barry and James Horner, I am now including him in that category of unforgettable and completely gifted musicians.( even if his other music wasn't so hot!) <br />He has captured the death and resurrection of our Savior in a touching way and I believe God used him to convey his incredible love to all of us. Don't run from the LIVING Jesus Christ, go see the movie if you haven't, and listen to this album. You will be moved.
B0002IVN9W|2.0|So, this is the new big thing. The White Stripes of 2004-05 seems to be Arcade Fire. I will say this, the album art is rather inspired and even beautiful. Someone certainly took their time with the packaging and it shows. Drawn to resemble a funeral program, it even features a nicely composed, gloomy pic of the band in their morbid best. If only this care went into the music. Although I won't argue that they are bad musicians - they can play their instruments and (from what I've heard) they put on a decent live show - I will say that this is one of the more derivative and uninspired albums that I've heard from a band that everyone seems to think is the next coming of sliced bread. From the first track, the comparisons begin - you have vocals that waver between David Byrne and Conor (Bright Eyes) Oberst and instrumentals that are as fresh as a few years ago (and why not throw in a retro (a la Squirrel Nut Zippers. Remember they were the hot new thing a few years ago, right after Chumbawumba. . .sigh) 40s girl on accordion. In the end, you have a band that seems ready for the big time. So for the serious music lover, you can move on. However, if you limit your musical experience to the fringes of NPR \\"Indie\\" radio and prefer bands that play to sold out crowds of the newly converted - you might like it. Still, you might want to wait for the \\"Next Big Thing\\" and give Arcade Fire a miss.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|A friend of mine with a \\"Vote For Pedro\\" sticker on his briefcase lent me this movie. Not everyone can relate to the dry humor or the \\"day in the life\\" pace. But give it a try and you'll find a lot to enjoy, particularly if you were among the geeky crowd in high school. There's an awesome soundtrack too. Great movie. Funny, sweet, often weird, but great.
B00003CWPR|1.0|Kubrick fans - count me in - tend to judge form at least as highly as content if not higher. We tend to deny this, but let's be honest, for a second.    Then came this, his last picture. And we learned: even the most polished form cannot save a stupid, annoying content. Eyes Wide Shut is nice to look at, no doubt. But the question looming over everything isn't just: what's the plot? It's: what the heck is the problem of all its protagonists?    The story relies on a novel from a century ago, and it shows. We just have other sorrows these days. After all, the wife of Tom Cruise's character didn't even cheat him, she (the movie's only highlight: Nicole Kidman) just t h o u g h t about doing it. And while they were smoking some dope (and hiding it, how sinful...!).    So what is he supposed to do? Run off to some prostitute, doing nothing (well, he kisses her, in a very sexy manner, granted), and sneaking into an orgy that looks like a crossing between Venezian Carnival and a Robert Palmer video clip (no offence, Robert). Not once does some sense of danger or urgency arise.    And yes, it's all very nice to look at. But now I understand some of my friends that never felt my enthusiasm for \\"2001\\", \\"Shining\\" or \\"Full Metall Jacket\\". It's all form, they say, and they are right - concerning this movie.    But the most painful thing to bear is the morale of \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\": Nicole contemplated sex with another man, Tom did the same in reverse and went to some strange party. But in the end they realised that they still had their marriage, and that it was good, oh so good. Better than all this sex caboodle, of course. And they realise this - in a super market...!    Well, there he goes, one of the best directors ever. De mortuis nihil nisi bene, as they say. So let's just think he was getting old. But let's not pretend that this is a masterpiece.
B00004RF9I|5.0|Perhaps this is more of an editorial comment than a review.  I wonder if those viewers under 30 who watch Network will grasp the delicious irony of this film.  A generation that has grown up on \\"Survivor\\", \\"Fear factor\\" and \\"American Idol\\" may not see anything unusual about \\"Sybil the Sooth-Sayer\\" as \\"news\\".  (In fact, those of us who have watched the unfortunate evolution of \\"news programming\\" over the past 15 years might not see anything unusual about it either). <br /> <br />And that is why this movie is so depressing.  If television, and news programming in particular, ever had any integrity, and had that integrity not slipped away, we could watch Network today and say \\"what a fabulous movie - what a dark comedy\\".  But alas, we can now only say the former, because this movie has proven to be more than prophetic. <br /> <br />For an actual plot synopsis, read any of the other (many excellent) reviews here. The acting is superb as is the direction.  Yes, we have some \\"wordy speeches\\" in the dialogue, but for some reason people seem more \\"touchy\\" about that with Network than other movies, and I'm not sure why. <br /> <br />William Holden is a fabulous actor, and this may be, from a \\"realism\\" perspective, his best.  His haggard and worn out features only magnify his unique(in this case)  \\"human-ness\\" - his is the only character that television does not somehow destroy (besides his wife).  Ned Beatty, Robert Duvall and Fay Dunaway, Peter Finch and Beatrice Straight all give stellar performances as well. <br /> <br />Maybe the saddest thing of all is that the most infamous line from the movie, \\"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore\\", did not turn out to be prophetic.  And because of that, television has sunk to a low that perhaps even Chayefsky and Lumet could not have imagined. <br />
0887431453|5.0|I recently purchased the Big Preschool Workbook for my soon to be 4 year old.  She went to a preschool for a few months and I can tell you that this is exactly the kind of material they were using in the preschool.  The worksheets start out by having the child circle items in a row that match the first item, then circle the item that is different and so on.  The first time my daughter and I sit down to work on this she did not stop until she had completed 10 pages and wanted to do more.  I think it works really well if you have pretend school.  I tell my daughter that it is time for school, explain what she is to do on a page and when she is finished with that page I check it to make sure it is right.  This is a GREAT book and I would definatley recommend it for any 3-5 year old.
B00000IQW3|4.0|The other reviews on this site cover most of what I want to say. But I would like to add that with all the sci-fi films that have been made, most on vastly superior budgets, none have brought me the sense of joy this film engenders. Certainly the CGI sequences (all space scenes were CGI - in 1984! - making this a ground-breaking film, as it was the first film to fully exploit CGI) are a bit quaint to our modern eyes. But many modern directors have become so enamoured with CGI that they forget about little items like plot, acting, etc.<br />This film has a straight-forward but well-balanced plot, full of subtleties and humour, a coherent script written by someone who understands the English language, good acting (Robert Preston nearly steals the show) and is well directed.<br />I couldn't estimate how many times I have watched the DVD (I initially had it on video as soon as it was released, one of the first with Hi Fi sound) - certainly more times than anything else in my collection - but I think this DVD is one of the most enjoyable sci-fi films ever made. I am 60, and I enjoy some of the classic films in the genre from the 50s (despite the terrible 'rocket' ships and flying saucers) right through to some of the better films being made now. (I'll let you into a secret - I like some of the bad ones too, just for the fun of it). But the Last Starfighter deserves to be remembered for what it achieved at its time in the history of sci-fi films; and for the sheer joy and warmth anyone can experience on watching it.
0767834739|4.0|People, if you want fleshed out characters and other cinematic niceties, why on earth would you even watch a movie like this?  It's meant to be an adrenaline rush, a cavalcade of fights and wow special effects.  Who cares about Alice's past?  We get enough from the first movie to fill us in.  This movie delivers what you should expect from this kind of moviemaking.  Milla Jovovich kicks butt in this one, which I think overall is better than the original, which seemed to be nothing more than an extended video game.  This time around we get Alice paired up with the likes of Mike Epps, Oded Fehr, Sienna Guillory and others.  Thomas Krestchmann who was so good in THE PIANIST makes an interesting villain.  There's lots of explosive action and twists and turns.  Its dark ending squeals for a third installment.  So relax enjoy this movie's mindlessness and appreciate the craft that was necessary to pull it off so nicely.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|...and that my best friend bought it for me!  I saw the boxed set at a store while I was doing my Christmas shopping, and was just tickled to death.  I remembered watching the show (it came on after John Doe, remember that one?) and loving it, but then I'd tune in and it wouldn't be there, so after a few more attempts, I gave up.  Fox's fault, but shame on me, too. <br /> <br />Anyway, I have never been a Buffy fan, never heard of Joss Whedon until Firefly, but I loved this show the few times I saw it, and after watching all the episodes, I love it even more.  The acting is just spot on, the stories are very involving, and the characterizations were just starting to get more involved...sort of like peeling an onion and getting down to the next layer.   I love the idea of life in the future  being a mixture of high tech and Old West...the barroom brawl where the guys are thrown through a window, but instead of the traditional glass breaking, it's just sort of a hologram-effect...really cool.  There is romance, and mystery and a feeling of family.  The captain is an intriguing fella - bitter, but innately noble.   You just know he's worth redeeming.  I would highly recommend this DVD set to just about anyone.  You won't be disappointed.  Well, except for the fact that you will want to know what happens next, and those mysteries certainly need explaining...I didn't know about the movie until I came here to write the review, so that just made my day. Enjoy!!
B00005RHGK|2.0|Just knowing that there is a sequel to this movie led me to want to see this movie.  After watching it, the reason is obvious.  The first movie answers little to nothing.  If anything, this movie was one big question mark. <br /> <br />Without going into detail of the story, suffice it to say that the main characters, the police, the psychic, and we the viewers have no idea what the creature is.  For horror aficionados, the creature is well done and scary.  Ideas of demons and or animal hybrids may come to mind.  Unfortunately for us, the movie never goes into detail.  The attempt of the creature to appear somewhat human is thrilling. <br /> <br />The main characters are a brother and sister traveling home from college.  Part of their discussion, as well as their trip to begin with, border on urban legend.  The siblings argue back and forth as only siblings can, but these actors do almost too good a job.  Before too long into the movie, I found myself completely siding with one and losing my temper with the other.  (Who hasn't yelled at the TV?)  Although this seems to detract for the story, the emotional response added to the movie experience for me. <br /> <br />Although I haven't seen the next one, I would hope that it answers the questions raised in this one.  Given that, I would recommend not watching this unless you are going to be watching the sequel soon afterwards <br />
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I made the mistake of walking by the television when my 13 year old daughter and her friend were watching this movie.  I sat down and never got up. <br /> <br />This film is hysterical, bizarre, and hits you from many different angles.  Everyone has known nerds like Napoleon - they are timeless although the fads and cliques of highs schools forever change.  So everyone can relate to it.  But liking the movie is a different matter. ND's character as an \\"anti-hero as hero\\" works (as does his \\"stuck in the past\\" Uncle), but somehow Pedro and Kip almost push the movie in another direction, which to me is the film's only \\"flaw\\".  Pedro just \\"doesn't work\\" and Kip's nerdiness (unlike ND's, which is brilliant) is too stereo-typical, reminiscent of some early Saturday Night Live skit. <br /> <br />The real key to enjoyment of this movie is not to take it seriously.  I even laughed at many of the 5-star reviews, some of these critics read far more into this film than I would ever dare.  Same with the ND \\"haters\\" - they either have no sense of humor at all or see it as \\"cruel\\". <br /> <br />Just have fun and watch the flippin' movie, O.K? (sigh!) <br /> <br />
B0002Z0EYA|4.0|What a beautiful movie (and I am not just referring to the many shots of rippling biceps!) The scenery is gorgeous, and the special effects are mostly believable. The acting is really good (Brad Pitt even surprised me.) I was blown away with Eric Bana, who plays Hector. He provided a great deal of gravity and dignity to his role. Overall, the cast is great. <br /> <br />The plot does stray from the original story, and, okay, the Trojan Horse DOES look like something you would buy a Pier 1. Still, I recommend this movie if you like epic battle scenes and a story centered on the meaning of love, family and honor.  <br /> <br />Did I mention Eric Bana?
0060090367|5.0|I didn't know what to expect, I saw her books in the book store and decided to give her a try.  It was such a refreshing read! I laughed and felt bad for her, and rooted for her when times were tough.  It was a funny and sarcastic read, very enjoyable, but not quite a beach read.  I recommend it if you want a fun ride with funny Irish charachters.    The main charachter's husband leaves her right after she gave birth to their daughter.  She moves back to her parent's house, and starts living with her crazy and disfunctional family.  Throughout couple of months, she learns how to deal with the new status as a mother, copes with her \\"watermelon\\" shape and weight, and finds love in her hectic and screwed up (in a good way of sorts) life.
0670033375|5.0|A sweeping book. Diamond sketches out the path of cataclysm. Environmental harm, climate alteration, fast population growth, and imprudent political choices were all factors in the ruin of some societies, but other societies found solutions and are surviving. Similar troubles face us today and have already brought calamity to Rwanda and Haiti, even as China and Australia are trying to muddle through in ground-breaking ways. Despite our own society's apparently limitless possessions and unequaled political power, portentous warning signs have begun to come into sight even in ecologically strong areas like Montana. This is an important book that raises many important questions. Every concerned person should read it.
6305972591|3.0|What is it about farm country?  As we drive past the fields, we see nothing but green with the occasional rooftop or silo in the distance.  What goes on deep in the fields?  Who is out there?  What is out there?  Is that person or thing religious? <br /> <br />This is classic horror.  The movie takes not just things we have looked out before, but things we have never really seen.  We hear religious fundamentalist all the time on the TV and radio.  We see corn fields often enough.  But we never really think much about them.  This story jumps into the imagination and makes the ordinary terrifying.  This is a good story. <br /> <br />The movie takes the farm country and religious fundamentalism and wraps them together with a twist.  A child, Isaac, gets visions, which tell him to create a new religion, killing all the adults.  Further, no adults shall be suffered to live.  His religion has some fundamentalist undertones, but also some bizarre rituals and ideas.  Oddly enough, this movie doesn't actually insult religion, but seems to ask the question, \\"What if what they said was real?\\" <br /> <br />By no means is this movie worthy of an Oscar, but this movie was never intended to be.  It was meant to thrill you a bit by showing you a slight twist to reality by playing with something we see every day.  This is a must for horror fans. <br />

B0000DJZ8R|1.0|Did hollywood really believe it could take a John Steinbech novel and turn it into a propaganda tool for socialism? Not quite. Having seen this film forty years ago, my recolection was a family of the dust bowl 1930's coping with the harsh realities of a changing deprssion era time.<br /><br /> Small family against big banking; david against goliath. The most graphic and telling sequence is when the evangeliquel government agent appears just as the<br /><br />joad's truck quits working. The Joad's now have to coast their disabled truck to the lights that turn out to be a US Department of Agriculture \\"sanitary unit #4\\".<br /><br /> This film was made at the time, before the second world war and after FDR's welfare state programs. It is a reaffirmation of a program that has ensnared millions of people then, as well as now.
038572179X|5.0|This novel is one of the best I have read in years.  By the end, you will feel the love, passion, longing, pain, and agonizing regret of \\"if only\\" right along with the beautifully developed characters.
B000000OAA|4.0|In my opinion this is Queen's most consistent album. It tones down the prog-rock of their first two efforts and lacks the cheese of Night at the Opera and everything after that to bring us a nice give-and-take between guitar bravado and vocal excess. And anyone who likes Queen knows that excess is key. <br /> <br />The set starts with the amazing Brighton Rock, very possibly the first--albeit brief--instance of recorded Thrash (and just as fast as it's ever been played). Like any Queen effort, the vocal embellishments give this record it's charm, but it's meat is definitely some heavy guitar work by May. There's only one hit (Killer Queen), and it actually tends to break up the album a bit rather than help it. A Brigton Rock into the Tenement/Valley pseudo-suite would have served this album much better and made it an even stronger classic than it already is. <br /> <br />Still, the rock pieces like Stone Cold Crazy and Now I'm Here seguey nicely into the vocal pieces, which are brilliant and not remotely as cheesy as those found in latter Queen works. Everything (besides Killer Queen) works well together and compliments it's fellow tracks.  <br /> <br />If what you're looking for is Queen in all it's essence and excess, I would suggest A Night at the Opera. If what you want is a quality hard rock album done with the skill of Queen's players, Sheer Heart Attack is your best bet.
B00000634B|5.0|If you love these guys as much as i do, you owe it to yourself to pick up the \\"Swing Cats\\" CD.  A repository of ex-Stray Cats' Slim Jim Phantom & Lee Rocker plus ex-members of the Polecats, the Swing Cats continue the Stray Cats conventions while covering artists as diverse as Carl Perkins, Hank Williams Sr. (\\"Mind Your Own Business\\") and Benny Goodman, with vocals supplied by an array of guests. Quite Good!
0316286850|4.0|THIS BOOK IS GREAT! COVERS EVERYTHING ABOUT MAKEUP, EVEN HOW TO DO SHADING TO MAKE A NOSE LOOK SMALLER! THE ONLY THING I DID NOT LIKE ABOUT THIS BOOK IS THAT THE AUTHOR DOES NOT SAY WHAT KIND OF MAKEUP HE IS USING ON THE MODEL. FOR INSTANCE I LIKED \\"THE BOMBSHELL\\" LOOK WHERE THE MAKEUP ARTIST MADE LISA MARIE PRESLEY LOOK LIKE MARILYN MONROE. I WAS THINKING, IF LISA MARIE PRESLEY CAN LOOK LIKE MARILYN MONROE, THEN SO CAN I. I HAD LONG BROWN HAIR LIKE RAQUEL WELCH IN HER YOUNGER YEARS & I CUT IT OFF & BLEACHED IT BLONDE, LIKE MARILYN. BAD IDEA. EVEN THOUGH I FOLLOWED \\"THE BOMBSHELL\\" LOOK DIRECTIONS, BLEACHED & CUT MY HAIR, I STILL DO NOT LOOK ANYTHING LIKE THAT PICTURE. I HAD NO CLUE WHAT COLOR MAKEUP TO BUY! I THINK IF YOUR INTERESTED IN COPYING ONE OF THE LOOKS IN THIS BOOK YOU SHOULD TAKE IT TO A PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP ARTIST, BECAUSE EVEN SOMEONE WHO HAS SOME SKILL WILL MOST LIKLEY NOT BE ABLE TO COPY THE LOOK THEY ARE GOING FOR.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Very rarely do movies compel me to watch them multiple times. But in the case of \\"Napoleon Dynamite.\\" I saw the movie 4 times in the theater (twice for the new wedding ending) and 3 times on DVD. I think the first time I saw it I was with friends who thought it would be a cross between \\"Welcome to the Dollhouse\\" and \\"Sixteen Candles.\\" It's not.<br /><br />It takes place in the director/co-writer's (Jared Hess) hometown of Preston, Idaho -- a town where time forgot. Sure there's the Internet for Kip to chat online with babes. But everyone dresses like Sears hasn't gotten any new clothes since 1987. The characters are something out of a David Lynch movie, without the horror. If Jerri Blank from \\"Stangers With Candy\\" had a fmaily just like her, this would be it. Nerdy just doesn't do it justice. What makes this film endearing and addictive probably has something to do with the fact that all the weird little moments in the film are based on things that really did happen to the director growing up in rural Idaho.<br /><br />So here's my list of interesting trivia and reasons why you should get this flick, now!<br /><br />* Best opening credits ever using condiments and school supplies to spell out cast and crew names!<br /><br />* The actor who plays the lead of Napoleon Dynamite -- Jon Heder -- actually drew all those bizarre sketches of unicorns farting, ligers and the portrait of the girl he asked to prom.<br /><br />* Big Jakes -- best strawberry shakes you'll ever down -- in Preston.<br /><br />* All Uncle Rico consumes during the film is steak and milk.

B00003CXS4|5.0|I watch this movie once a week, no joke, I love it that much. The scenes, the lines, the situations, the characters, the jokes, and Mickey all form to make, like, the best friggin movie ever! I watch this movie once a week, no joke. I almost wish I had time to watch it once a day. Sorry my review wasn't more poetic or satirical but I am afflected by my love for this movie, almost to the point of speechlessness. Oh and did I mention the lines, they are the best. And everytime that dog swallows that squeeky ball, and then barks with a distinct squeek, I litteraly lose it everytime. I can't help myself.  <br />\\"Tommy, what's that in your trousers?\\"  <br />\\"It's me belt Turkish.\\" <br />\\"Its a gun, why do you have a gun in your trousers for Tommy?\\" <br />\\"Its for protection.\\" <br />\\"Protection from what, ze' Germans?\\"
B00003CX9S|5.0|I first saw this film back in 1981 at the theater when I was 12. It frightened and saddened me though I cannot say I was really traumatized by it. However, it must have made some sort of emotional impact before I have always been terrified of viewing this film in the 20-plus years that have past since then. The most disturbing aspect to me was the inhumane treatment John Merrick received. Just today I got up my courage and bought the DVD at the music store. I sat, white knuckles and all-expecting the worst. Well, I got through it. For one thing, it didn't seem as ominous this go-round. (Funny how your perceptions change as an adult). The fact that this was a period piece works to the film's benefit in that it hasn't dated at all. I am glad the producers and director agreed to use black-and-white film because it adds to the authenticity. What surprised me most was how much I had actually forgotten: the scene in the monkey cage, the fact that Anne Bancroft appeared, and more. What did always stick in my memory was what I refer to as the \\"raid\\" scene. (When the sleazy Night Porter brings his \\"customers\\" from the pub to Merrick's room, carrying John around, forcing the cheap tarts to kiss him, and then holding a mirror up to his face to purposely shock him.) Upon viewing The Elephant Man as an adult, my favorite scenes are now the most beautiful yet the saddest ones: when John meets Treeves' wife and says he never meant to be a disappointment to his mother, and the final scene as Merrick carefully takes the pillows off the bed and places them on the table. This film should be mandatory study for all North American high school students. Though even then, I am sure there would be more than a few jaded teens who would find some sort of comedy in it. Those kind are the real freaks.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I think this is tyhe best cd A7X has made yet so don't listen to the guy before me, because unlike him, i'm actualy going to do a review about the cd. This cd has amazing riffs, vocals, and drum parts. M. Shadows is a great singer.Sinister Gates and Zacky Vengeance are great guitarists. You can't understand unless you have it, this cd is just plain awesome.Some parts are slow, and then it sort of fades into hardcore guitar parts and insane screaming. There is also a lot of frickin' awesome double bass drum parts, you'll love it.
B00006L3S3|4.0|when i bought this album i wanted something with Lennon material i wasn't familiar with. The only track i heard before was the famous MindGames which i liked. Overall, this is a good album with some tracks showing Lennon at his best such as MindGames(a nice piece of polished pop with intelligence)Tight A$ and Meat City (both solid Lennon rockers) and the beautiful You Are Here, and Out the Blue.  <br /> <br />Other tracks such as One Day, Intuition, and Aisumasen do ok, although the new remastered disk features an acoustic version of Aisumasen which i enjoyed more than the album track. But they are both there on the new disk. <br /> <br />I know(i know) is a track that i couldn't really get too into  <br />because it repeats itself a bit too much. Bring on the Lucie(Freda Peeple)is a political song that was a hit(?) for Lennon in the early 70's but now seems a bit dated but still enjoyable. The only real dud for me was Only People which is another political song and the album could have easily done without it  (i wish it had anyway)Its not that i don't like his political stuff or views...give peace a chance, war is over, luck of the Irish, power to the people are all good tunes. <br /> <br />Overall, its Lennon doing material similar to Imagine which is good and its what i wanted. I would recommend this to fans who would like to get to know Lennon's work a bit better since this album is filled with great tracks. For casual fans i would suggest Imagine or his newest compilation, both showcase Lennon's immense power as a songwriter much more directly. I myself got exactly what i wanted, one thing to keep in mind is a so-so album from Lennon is like a great album from anybody else.
B000002H97|5.0|Love it or hate it this is a fantastic album. If it had been released by anyone but Metallica I garuntee their wouldn't be so much negativity. It's only being lumped because of it's comparison to thier previous work. Wich is silly when you think about it. After all, if it sounds good who cares? I sure don't. While Sandman and several others have been played to death there are still masterpieces that got little attention and are worth buying the cd for. Just look at \\"Don't tread on me\\" and \\"Through the never\\"  Overall, an album worthy of five stars.     But on a side note it's funny how everyone wants to call Metallica sellouts. So they didn't follow forumla, big deal. Isn't everyone forgetting that's how Kill em all\\" came about? They did what felt good. Not what they were \\"supposed\\" to do. After making four fast paced, mind blowing metal albums in a row. (depsite the death of Burton) I'd imagine exploring the mainstream felt good too. Besides, I know for a fact alot of modern metal fanatics wouldn't have even given old school metal  a second glance if it wasn't for this album. Yes, it is a mainstream album but it still managed to expand the metal audience and bring attention to old school msterpieces like KEA RTL MOP and JFA. Very few radio stations played Metallica on a normal rotation prior to the black album. But now they're everywehere, old and new. And we have their mainstream entrance to thank for that. My local station dedicates forty minutes every Monday night to playing nothing but Metallicas greatest. Wich usually consists of their first four albums. Now tell me that isn't good publicity for true metal everywhere?
0385510454|5.0|First and foremost Mr. Grisham is an entertainer.  The price of this book is cheap compared to the pleasure that comes from reading it.  Too often we are unnecessarily critical, especially when it comes to the writers who have written well in the past.  Was this book one of Grisham's best?  I really don't know, but I do know that I read it in one sitting and my biggest regret is that I know I'll have to wait year or more for another book, like this, from him.  I just hope he never stops writing.  For those of you looking for technical flaws, well there is one on page 329 that gets repeated a number of times in the following 10-15 pages.  See if you can spot it.  Thanks Mr. Grisham for the great read!!
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Tuesday, January 18, 2005 / 4 of 5 / Toiling in the Shadow of Jackson<br /><br />The Lord of the Rings trilogy has spoiled us and raised the bar for would be epics.  Without the spectre of Peter Jackson looming behind it, Troy would have been a lot more impressive.  Still, for its bright sandy sweep it is an enjoyable romp if one overlooks the departures from Homer's Iliad, particularly the time compression from 10 years to a week or so, and just enjoy the ride.  For those of us who have actually read the epic, there are well detailed `Hollywoodisms' that tend to detract more than Jackson's artistic license w/ Tolkien.  I was however pleased with the tragic hero treatment of Hektor, and thought Bana did a fine job.  The CG army clashes were frankly, paltry, compared to the ferocity of Helms Deep and Minis Tirith battles, but it was nice to have a lighter palette of the desert.  The cast did a good job, even if Brian Cox as Agamemnon was a somewhat unconvincing warrior leading his armies, he chewed scenes in the more personal dialogues.  I'm sure kids will clamor for this when they're assigned the Iliad in school, but bear in mind the differences and do take the time at least someday to read the first and arguably greatest epic story in Western civilization.
B000002UAX|5.0|Probably the best Beatles Album because it has so many great tracks which are all so different from eachother. They were all emerging as individuals and u can really hear the interesting quirks of each member. My personal favorites are Happiness is a Warm Gun, BlackBird, While my Guitar Gently Weeps, I Will, and Revolution. I recommend it to anyone who has ears.
B00008H2LB|2.0|This CD is a perefct example of why alot of folks hate new metal. First there's the drums. Like most new metal bands they are processed and myre the depth of the music and overal quality of the alledged metal feel. The lyrics are just what every drama queen teenage punk wants to hear. Wich is pure uncontrolled emeotional despair and rage. Not only is it annoying and cliche, but it takes very little skill to write. The giutars are an improvment from Hybrid Theory, hats off to them for elvoving in that department at least. But they are still simplistic to the point of limiting the replay value significantly. <br /> <br /> All in all....It's a notch above other new metal bands at best, and a slap in the face to music in general at worst. You decide.
B0006399FS|3.0|U2's career seems to have followed 3 distinct paths <br /> <br />1. 1980's - establishing their trademark sound, excellent albums and worthwhile collaborations with B.B King, Dylan among others.  <br /> <br />2. 1990's - pushing the boundaries of rock and roll, and totally reinventing their sound. Their best period in my opinion, some of the work on Achtung Baby, Zooropa, and Pop is nothing short of spectacular. Artistic integrity, not record sales. <br /> <br />3. 2000's - making the same album as the previous one, and playing it completely safe. Making radio-friendly songs in order to sell as many records as possible. <br /> <br />Dont get me wrong, HTDAAB isnt a bad album at all, indeed its far better consistency-wise than 2000's All That You Can't Leave Behind. Its just that i never thought U2 would go down this road, of middle-aged mediocrity. Songs like City Of Blinding Lights, and Yahweh, however, just dont live up to previous work at all. U2 was once known for never making the same album twice, and constantly trying to push the boundaries of their sound. Those days it seems, though, are over. Time to call it a day guys.
0060930187|4.0|The Bell Jar is an insight into a young girl's mind and how life influenced the way she thought and how she acted. It's a very good read because everyone has been upset or depressed sometime in their life and this lets you know that there is someone else out there who is going through the same thing. <br />The prospect of chemistry also plays a major role in the book. Esther, the main character was affected by medicines and the behaviors of others which all played into why she was so lonely and suicidal. The novel goes into amazing detail of the current situation that Esther was in and how she reacted to them, it showed how she developed and grew with her experiences and how she finally overcame her illness. This novel is not only well written but it opens up a fictional character's heart and lets people examine it and therefore fully comprehend what is going on and why it's occurring. It informs people about depression and sparks their interest about it while using immense literary tactics to allow readers to truly enjoy the entire story.
B000002UVZ|5.0|.....this was my FAVORITE album. In fact, this still has the distinction of being my FAVORITE ALBUM OF ALL TIME. I loved the music REM produced in the 80's. It was wonderful. It was deep and quirky at the same time. With \\"Life's Rich Pagent\\" REM proves what a truly great band they are. In every aspect. This is the first album where Michael Stipe decides to let us really hear his voice and his lyrics. The music is not overwhelming his singing like it was on \\"Murmur\\", \\"Reckoning\\" and \\"Fables of the Reconstruction.\\" I guess he overcame his shyness. Whatever it was, he sounds beautiful on this album. My favorite songs are \\"I Believe\\", \\"Flowers of Guatemala\\" and \\"Fall On Me\\"c but truthfully, I love EVERY song on this album. There is no bad song. There is no \\"average\\" song. \\"Life's Rich Pagent\\" is on my list of all time greatest albums. For those new to REM, I strongly recommend you start with this album. It simply blows their new stuff out of the water (and by \\"new\\" I'm talking about anything they have dropped since 1990). REM's finest peice of work.
B000002TQV|5.0|I really enjoyed this album, I have owned it for years so if you are looking to buy it now then you have been a bit deprived. I read some of the other reviews and I do agree that the cd as a whole does take some time to get used too but for me once I pushed play I fell in love with it. Of course not everything is for everyone so listen to the sound bites first and decide for yourself. I hope this helped you....
B00064MW6A|2.0|I've heard for years and years that they were gonna make a Catwomen movie with Michelle Pfeiffer returning as Selena Kyle. That never got off the ground though and stupidly Warner Brothers decided to do it without Selena Kyle. It bugged a lot of comic fans that they'd do it without even having the character from the comic. It's not even original either, she even becomes Catwomen the same way Pfeiffer did in Batman Returns. Plus it's played out like Halle Berry has 2 peronalities and she has no control what she does when she has on the costume. Which is pretty silly and doesn't work. Plus the direction is done like a music video, hell think the director even started out making music videos. The action is too fast and messy looking to even be entertaining. Not one once of the action scenes even look realistic.<br /><br />  I always thought that if Michelle Pfeiffer wouldn't come back that Sharon Stone could replace her. Instead of thinking...duh Sharon Stone could play Catwomen they cast her as an aging model obsessed with looking good. She has Halle Berry killed because she discovered that her aging make-up is dangerous. So Berry is brought back by cats and doesn't find it strange that she's more athletic and has a craving for cat food. She out plays Benjaman Bratt in Basketball and by jumping all over walls and being super athletic. Yet he doesn't figure out right away that she's catwomen. Oh plus she clawed his back when they had sex and...duh.<br /><br />  It's not a good movie, not by a long shot but still Batman & Robin makes it look like Spiderman 2.  Halle Berry thinks she's too good to have a small role in X-Men as Storm but hey at least those are good super hero movies. Plus after embarrassing herself in this she should settle for playing Storm with open arms. If they couldn't get Michelle Pfeiffer back they should've just said ok that's it...no movie. Either that or could've just had someone else play Selina Kyle. This movie is some fun here and there but the dialogue is awful. Plus isn't that much of a difference between Halle Berrie's performance here and Elizabeth Berkley's in Show Girls.he dialogue is awful. Plus isn't that much of a difference between Halle Berrie's performance here and Elizabeth Berkley's in Show Girls.
1400034779|4.0|This book is not a deep difficult book to read.  It would be a great book for a plane or doctor's office because most chapters tell their own story.
B0006213WG|3.0|First listen to The Bitter End carfully, let the song sink in. Then, if you can, download the Metallica song Battery and listen to it closely. I you like the second one a lot better, buy the Master of Puppets album and forget about \\"Chuck\\". The only truly positive thing I can say about this album is the Sum 41 picked the greatest band of all time to rip-off. At least they have good music taste...
0670033375|5.0|Many of the foregoing shrill and unintentionally hilarious reviews of this book appear to prove the author's main thesis. Perhaps Amazon.com might do well to reconsider the wisdom of allowing the great-and apparently deranged-unwashed a public forum for enunciating their inchoate objections to a work of such timely scholarship.
0790731002|3.0|I wonder what Tim Burton would've done with this movie. The script probably would've been a lot better for one. Plus if he had Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones as Riddler and Two Face. I highly doubt he would've had them acting like villains from the 60's tv show. Plus Batman is cooler and more mysterious without Robin. So if they have a new trilogy after Batman Begins they should never bring Robin and Batgirl into the picture. Val Kilmer gets more of a chance to prove himself as Batman than George Clooney did though.<br /><br />  Val Kilmer plays Bruce Wayne as a man fighting his inner-demons who has flaschbacks of his past. Scenes like him having flashbacks of falling into a cave with bats is where the movie works the most. Plus he doesn't have bad chemestry with Nicole Kidman either. They're laidback in their roles when everyone else is hopping all over the place acting goofy. So their scenes together are refreshing and almost sorta engaging. This movie is a step in the wrong direction after Burton's films. Still it's fun and harmless and didn't kill the trilogy like Batman & Robin did. Hell it's a masterpiece compared to Batman & Robin.<br /><br />  Joel Schumacher was just wrong to do Batman though. I mean instead of worrying about having a good script he worried more about how to get a good shot of Batman's [...]. If he did another one, he'd probably start having close-ups of Alfred's [...] or Commisioner Gordan's. Focusing on shots of the super heroes [...] isn't exactly giving a comic the kind of respect it deserves. I mean you don't see Sam Raimi focusing on how Tobey Maguire's ass looks in the Spiderman costume. He treats the movies with respect and won't film a movie until he's 100% sure he has a good story to tell. So Joel Schumacher could've learned  a lot from Sam Raimi on how to make a super hero movie.
0156027321|2.0|I felt this book was about 100 pages  too long in the middle. I enjoyed the first part until they got on the boat much more than the middle.  The end left me with a \\"WOW\\" feeling, but it wasn't worth suffering through the middle of the book.   <br /> <br />This is a \\"thinking\\" book and is not a light fun read.  I think you have to read it twice to even get it.
B0006399FS|4.0|I am quite surprised at all the negative reviews on here.  One reviewer hit the nail on the head in saying: Like Achtung Baby, HTDAAB takes several listens before it's sheer brilliance really hits you.  This album is nothing short of magnificant.  After disappointments of POP (although it's finally growing on me) and ATYCLB, it is great that U2 has released a new powerhouse record, full of great music, beautiful ballads, and well-written lyrics.  Songs like \\"Miracle Drug\\", \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\", \\"One Step Closer\\", \\"Original of the Species\\", and \\"Yahweh\\" are some of the most beautiful songs this group has put out.  Throw in \\"Vertigo\\", \\"Love and Peace or Else\\", \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" and \\"City of Blinding Lights\\", and you've got one heck of a fantastic album.  The only song I don't really care for is \\"A Man and a Woman\\".  Other than that, I rank this album right up there with \\"The Joshua Tree\\", \\"Achtung Baby\\" and \\"Zooropa\\" as a true masterpiece. <br /> <br />Like \\"Achtung Baby\\" and \\"Zooropa\\", this one took a while to grow on me, so give it a chance.
B000002KNY|5.0|Cohesive, yet dynamic, complex, yet simple, smart and silly at the same time, a product of it's time yet timeless, and even ahead of its time.  This is the best Heads album!  From start to finish it covers mundane subjects but manages to be intelligent, quirky, and extremely consistent.  This is the most listenable album by the band.  It can be viewed as a concept album because of the minimalist titles for all the songs.  David Byrne's choice of titles and subjects gives the album it's consistence regarding lyrical content.  Amazingly, the music is just as consistent.  It flows from one song to the next while maintaining artistic brilliance.  My favorite lyric of the album has to be \\"animals think they're pretty smart: s**t on the ground, see in the dark!\\"  Given the context of that lyric within the song makes it hilarious.  In one of the previous songs Byrne wrote called \\"Artists Only\\" he remarks on how artists tend to be exclusive and carry elitist attitudes because they are \\"artistic.\\"  He wrote that he doesn't need to prove that he is artistic.  This album definitely proves he is very much of an artist in every sense of the word.  Of course the rest of the heads are there and they play perfectly as they always do.  \\"The human drum machine,\\" Chris Frantz lends simple and eclectic drumming to go along with the funky and original bass lines of Martina Weymouth.  Her bass is a centerpiece in this band.  Jerry Harrison provides rhythmic strums, mutes, and riffs, among other sounds on the guitar.  And Brian Eno's spacey, minimalist production is at it's most effective on this work.  It took me a long time to pick one after owning all the Heads albums but this is definitely my favorite.  You won't find another heads album where every song is excellent and where you can listen to the whole album straight through every time, although \\"Speaking in Tongues\\" is close.  This is a must for die-hard fans.  And to everyone else, it will probably make you a die hard, or at leastallow you to appreciate what this band was able to accomplish.
B0006399FS|5.0|This album is brilliant. Like any other great U2 album, you will have to give it time. Remember when Achtung Baby! came out? Well, you didn't like it from Day 1. Right? And now it regularly makes the Top 20 albums of all time lists. <br /> <br />Like Keith Richards said - \\"I hear a lot of rock these days, but very little roll\\". If you come from that school of thought, this is your album. If you like most of the Nu-metal bands (singing mindless crap) out there, then this might not be for you. U2's last two albums are more Beatlesque. And to some people that can be boring and uninspired. You make the call! <br /> <br />Can't wait for the tour. Live...is where they live. <br /> <br />
B000001ESN|4.0|As a relative newcomer to Rush, I nabbed 2112, Moving Pictures, and this album.  Moving Pictures has to be my favorite of the three, with this a close second.  I've noticed Rush albums tend to be frontloaded with the good stuff, and finish strong, but the middle isn't particularly hard-rocking on the three CDs I have.  The breakdown goes like this: <br /> <br />1. The Spirit of Radio - Killer track, and a heck of a good opening tune.  I love it, and it still gets the airplay it deserves. 10/10 <br />2. Freewill - Another fantastic track.  I especially like the breakdown before Lifeson's guitar solo, when Geddy Lee thumps around on the bass.  Great lyrics (though with Rush that's par for the course!) 10/10 <br />3. Jacob's Ladder -  Sort of sludgey, but the GREAT riff during the second half of the song really saves it, in my opinion.  Very effective in what it is going for (a battle or something between good and evil), and strikes me as a very heavy take on Led Zeppelin's Battle of Evermore.  The second half of the song rocks hard, Lifeson plays a fantastic riff in a nutty time signature.  But I still don't like the sludgey stuff in the first half, so this only gets 7/10.  1st part is 6/10, 2nd part is 9.5/10. <br />4. Entre Nous - Notably softer than the first three tracks.  However, thats a good thing in this case.  I like this one a lot, it's light, somewhat airy, and it ponders love with thought that frankly is deeper than your average rock n' roll fair.  8.5/10 <br />5. Different Strings - Similar to Entre Nous, but a little heavier.  Another reviewer said it was introspective, and they're right.  Probably my second least favorite song on the album, but its still pretty good.  7/10 <br />6. Natural Science - A cautionary epic about technology.  The first two movements (the song is better than 9 minutes, and composed of 3 movements) are okay, not really to my taste.  The third movement rocks hard, when instead of warning everybody about  what NOT to do, Geddy Lee lets us know what would be the RIGHT thing to do.  After being force-fed Arthur Miller in highschool, I'm pretty much dog-sick of cautionary tales.  It's refreshing to hear somebody who has an idea on how to actually fix things, rather than just complaining.  Which Neal Peart certainly does, and by Jiminey he's right!  7.5-8/10, but the last third of this song is great.  Decent way to close an album.  Not quite Led Zeppelin's 'Bring It On Home' or 'When the Levee Breaks', but it does the job nicely. <br /> <br />If you're new to Rush, I would recommend both Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures as your starting point.  Great music on both discs, and they pretty much capture what Rush is all about.  At least, what they were like before they really went to the synthesizers.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|The world is divided into two types of people:  those who adore Napoleon Dynamite and those who abhor Napoleon Dynamite.  The only way to know which side you are on is to watch the movie.  As for me and my family, we love the movie.  I have seen it six times and am ready to see it again.  I will laugh out loud just thinking about the many hilarious scenes in the movie.  Those who love the movie belong to a club that all outsiders will never understand.  And thats sweet.

B000007XUQ|4.0|For a very short time, the original \\"Christmas Portrait\\" album was available on cd but unfortunately, like many, I waited too long and had to console myself with the new, \\"deluxe\\" version.  <br /> <br />While it had some tracks from \\"Christmas Portrait\\" and \\"An Old-Fashioned Christmas\\", a lot of great music was missing. Richard Carpenter even mentions in the liner notes of the new two disc collection how fans outright demanded the release of the two original albums on cd.  <br /> <br />Owen Myers hit the nail on the head in his review. I thought I was the only one who noticed the reverb on the first disc. While I can ignore it when played as background music, I cannot when I'm truly listening. I have also noticed this on other tracks from other albums that have been remastered (and remixed) and it is unfortunate because on the original vinyl albums, Karen's voice is so clean and clear. She does not need vocal \\"diffusion\\" and while I have always had great respect for Richard as a producer and arranger, I cannot understand his need or desire to go back and \\"fix\\" something that is not broken.  <br /> <br />It is interesting to note that the second disc, \\"An Old-Fashioned Christmas\\" sounds (at least to me) to be untouched with no remastering or remixing. You can almost hear the texture of Karen's voice. Perhaps, Richard thought it was too \\"rough\\" on the   first disc and this is why there is an airy (if you like that) quality to it.   <br /> <br />I may be wrong but I believe Karen passed away before the second  disc was finished which would explain why there is so much instrumental filler (as nice as it is) and why there is such a long lead time (almost 15 minutes) before Karen sings a single note.  <br /> <br />So now I have both the \\"deluxe\\" version and the double disc version with hopes of one day finding the original \\"Christmas Portrait\\" disc in a used cd store or on-line. For those with discerning ears, the original version is worth having.

B000002UAX|5.0|i have just fallen in love with this album  for the third time, and im only 21! i think it will always be the album dearest to my heart out of so many i own. because it so powerful but also because it was the first album i ever loved. listening to this album and really listening to music at all for the first time at the age of 7 i was literally wide eyed with wonder - i think i had been a beatles fanatic in a past life and it just all came back to me! <br />as dark and charles manson inspiring as it is claimed to be and in some ways is, i initially found it to be the most fantastical storybook for the ears ever concieved. I just read about 10 minutes ago that the album was actually going to be called 'A Doll's House', and its no wonder. it could well be considered the most childish rock record ever made. <br /> <br />sick from school and bored i picked up my eldest brothers cassette player and pressed play. i rewound the tape back to the start repeatedly until midday. i think it was just 'part one' that i listened to but that was enough. songs like ob-la-di ob-la-da, rocky raccoon, bungalow bill, wild honey pie, piggies, martha my dear and blackbird were like adventure stories for kids. even the more serious songs had the most amazing imagery like happiness is a warm gun (
0671027344|2.0|Okay, this book was not the be-all, end-all of YA literature that some previous reviewers seem to think it was. It wasn't complete trash - the author obviously made an attempt to tap into that crazy world we call adolescence. <br /> <br />However, it fell short of the mark for me, and I'll be fifteen in a week, so I think I would have some clue about what's really going on in our minds.  <br /> <br />For one thing, Charlie's view of life was incredibly simplistic and did not leave a lot of room for self-revelation or growth of any kind. Basically, he was the nice, somewhat reserved guy who had the misfortune of watching other people foul up, until he joined them. Then, they still kept being human, you know, doing \\"teen\\" stuff, breaking up, getting high, except that he joined them and uncovered something painful and repressed about himself along the way. I won't say anything more plot-wise, but in terms of how \\"universal\\" this book is, I really don't see it. The characters seemed to serve no purpose except help (or sometimes not help) Charlie feel better about himself and the situations he was put through, which were, save for maybe two instances, ridiculously contrived. <br /> <br />If you're expecting Catcher in the Rye, forget it. This book does not even come close to touching Salinger's masterpiece, because of the predictable banality of its lead character, who seems to be a \\"prodigy\\" and yet doesn't come close to the writing talents of many sixteen year olds I know. Hell, I'm a year younger than the guy, and he makes ME look like Kafka.  <br /> <br />There is nothing \\"universal\\" about transcribing events of adolescence that we may or may not have experienced. What makes Salinger (vs Chbosky) so great is he does so in a way that's actually realistic, i.e. hypocrisy, cynicism, and a view of life that isn't so Mister Rogers. Most of us can't be some kind of saints as days pass on this complicated, very unpredictable world. <br /> <br />The book just felt like it was set somewhere else, somewhere we've all seen before and yet doesn't really exist. It's not a completely wasted effort, as there were a few moments that were quite touching and unexpectedly so, but in my opinion, the author could take a few lessons from J.D. before spouting off another caricature.
B00005JLRT|5.0|You've got to be kidding me! I watched this movie already 4-5 times since I bought it, and still it brings to life the real reason for not cloning, that clones will always think that it is just an mere echo of the real person. No matter what excuse it gives, like being raised in the mines and learning real hate dished out by Romulans, and any other excuse, the real reason is that clones will always think of theirselves as mere shadows, unable to live up to the real person. We aspire to better ourselves, but that can not be reasoned by a clone. It is not real, it is just an echo. On the heels of Star Trek II:The Wrath of Khan, this movie stands as the best of the Next Generation movies made. That right! When you think about how the Romulans are willing to act, when you think that you are going to be one to make diplomatic contact and be friends, when you find a foe that rather end everything else, instead of himself (as a clone) you as the Captain Picard are just presented with one of the weirdest battles a person would ever face. See yourself, and the other side of you, as presented by your clone. And as the real person, at all costs to normality, you can not let it happen, personally to the point of giving your own life to leave others to live, except for a robot, that aspires to be human, but can not, and sees himself with a B4 model, that drives it also drives this movie as a total experience. Unlike a human, a robot can sacrify his life, he is just a mere robot, and in the end, becomes more human just by that act, but will not realize it. The depth of this film demands full attention, as to all the details, such as the strife within the Romulans with some wanting peace and some willing to do anything for war and to win. With only one purpose in mind, what is your purpose in life? To aspire to be better, to be more, or to end it all, and be known throughout the Galaxy (or so you think) as someone who was really thinking that anyone is that important? <br />Also again, the crew of the Enterprise crash the Enterprise, like never before, because even if you just got married, you may end up dying, and only could live for the moment, and not perhaps, for the future of your dreams! <br />Where is that Romulan drink at the end? <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|After Pop ( rediscovered recenty by thousands of dissapointed fans ) the band became increasingly conventional. This album just displays something to feed those hysterical, swooning teens who love anything named as \\"U2\\". <br /> <br />It's an unwritten rule that any new product seem to be \\"the best\\", even for \\"critics\\" like Rolling Stone. But U2 forgot 99% of their fans aren't those children who listen to Jessica Simpson or Beyonce, so we can't swallow the hype alone.  <br /> <br />We were promised a \\"REAL PUNK ROCK ALBUM\\" ( Bono, 2004 ) and that's what seems to be if you take a look at the sleeve. With the cover front alone U2 make fool of fans. That's something censureable. Far from the former \\"three chords and the truth\\" band we discovered by 80's. <br />What we found was just something we've heard since 2000. AN UNDENIABLE FRAUD. <br /> <br />Everything was calculated, neverthless they made a big mistake: to take us for granted. Everything they did was wrong. And now they have to carry on with that. Fans don't want to be treated as stupid children anymore. We don't care if they're going to tour, it will be a vocal disaster, and surely it will be a mix between 90's and Elevation Tour. U2 have become a predictable commercial company. Pathetic <br />
B00008WT5E|3.0|This is the worst AC/DC album i have, (i have Dirty Deeds, Flick of the Switch, and This one) but it's still pretty good. Though some of the songs are the best that they made, (ex rock'n'roll damnation & sin city) some songs, like riff raff, are just plain FORGETTABLE.
0385510454|3.0|As per the norm, I pick up Grisham's novels and knock them out in a couple days. I enjoyed the plot. I like the twists & turns. I thought that he took an usual turn into the world of espionage, but it read fairly well. My only complaint was the ending. Many loose ends...stories not completed...questions unanswered etc. Almost like he was setting the stage for a return of this character in a later offering. If this is the last we see of Mr. Backman I would have liked a bit more closure. <br />
0385510454|4.0|Good book, but it just isn't quite the page turner that his older books are. The Broker has all the elements of a great novel - good characters, interesting plot, great setting, action...but it just lacks that extra punch that keeps me up reading way past bedtime, afraid to put the book down. Every time a new Grisham novel arrives, I can't wait to get my hands on it. I never have been completely disappointed, but I just haven't enjoyed the last five or so years compared to the earliest novels he wrote.  <br /> <br />The last half of the book, while much more exciting than the first, also left me a little doubtful. Then the last 20 or so pages, to me, were just not believable - can a middle aged man with no prior experience outrunning international hit men REALLY outsmart/outwit them? But - I don't think fiction has to be completely believable in order to be enjoyable, and I certainly did enjoy the book. <br /> <br />Mr. Grisham - write us another mafia novel! (Wow, maybe there's a new plot line for him - maybe he's afraid to write a novel about the new generation of the mafia because they've threatened him...and he has to go undercover and use a pen name, and in doing research for the book he uncovers a sinister governmental plot....)
0446677450|4.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad is a profound book that challenges conventional ideas.  While some of the ideas are obvious, some are new to me and hard to grasp.  With proper understanding this book has the power to change a persons life and the way they look at money.  However, many of the techniques such as the stock market and real estate investing are over simplified and presented in a way that makes them seem a lot easier than they are. <br /> This book can be used as a tool to jump start a succussful financial future.   I am glad I chose to read this book and am going to buy the sequel book, Rich Dad's Guide to Investing.
1400032717|5.0|This is a wonderful story about a young man, Christopher, who happens to be autistic and his adventures of solving the mystery of a neighbor's murdered dog, writing this story, and living life.  It is a brutally honest view of his family and \\"friends\\" and how he sees them. <br /> <br />Christopher shows no emotion, cannot stand to be touched, and sees the world from a very logical stand point.  It is interesting reading how he reasons through everyday events.  It is funny and sad at the same time.  Christopher is pure and innocent...and it is amazing looking at the world through his eyes (or words). <br /> <br />Haddon did a magnificent job writing this story.  I can't wait for his next story.  He is a wonderful...wonderful author.

B0000009OP|5.0|This band is so cool I bet Miles Davis would have dug them with their minimalist sound somehow sounding upbeat and downbeat simultaneously. They also had a completely original sound by basically utilizing just sax, drums and a 2 string slide bass. Few bands can claim such originality. I can't hear any influences with the possible exception of a little bit of The Doors (another trio that was missing a key rock instrument).  <br /> <br />This was Morphine's second album...released in 1994. Every song is strong with my favorite tracks being \\"Buena\\", \\"Thursday\\" and \\"In Spite Of Me\\" which also includes a six string guitar. If you don't already have this, you should.

1892005034|3.0|Toward the end of the 1970's, while studying at the Gestalt Institute San Diego, I was treated by a colleague to an intriguing list of tips about the use of language from a group in Southern California calling itself the Center for Nonviolent Communication (CNVC). I found the list both intriguing and helpful, and I sought to practice what I could understand of it, but somehow never discovered the source. About 25 years later the work of Marshall Rosenberg surfaced for me and I was both delighted to reconnect with the NVC movement and also curious as to how the passage of so much time might have affected its development as well as my understanding and acceptance of the technology of communication that it forwards.<br /><br />In the passing years, I had changed substantially in my outlook toward humanistic as well as traditional psychology, shifting my thinking in the direction of linguistics and cognitive science. I immersed myself in intercultural studies and gained experiences working abroad that distanced me to some degree from my US ethnocentricity and provided cultural perspective on ideas and movements that I had formerly swallowed whole.<br /><br />Treated to a review copy of Nonviolent Communication, I feasted on it with an appetite whetted by years of waiting. At the same time I attempted to critique the cuisine with the palate I had developed since I had last tasted it. What did I discover?<br /><br />First, then as now, I was reminded that NVC remains an act of courage, courage to confront self and others with both honesty and empathy. This has not become easier in a culture that, from kindergarten to White House, seems to value shooting from the hip followed up by cover-your-ass strategies.<br /><br />Other important insights emerged. For years I had been uncomfortable with assertiveness training where a constantly whining, \\"You make me feel...\\" subtext is camouflaged under the rubric of \\"When you do/say X, I feel Y.\\" People were learning assertive scripts but practicing them punitively, that is, without the intentionality that would allow them to become constructive. It is this intentionality that is at the core of NVC. Life is frequently made up of competition and acquisitiveness, and trying to look good when clawing our way to the top tempts us to put on appearances of trendy communications practice in order look good and be liked.<br /><br />Being positive is the sine-qua-non of today's US culture. Put another way, the quickest route to becoming a pariah in both work and social contexts is to fail to show the obligatory positive attitude.  Negative judgments, failure to look on the bright side, criticism, mourning failures and losses head a list of US capital sins. The result sounds good on the surface-positive feedback, lots of encouragement, and a steady diet of \\"atta' boy/atta' girl\\" language. Negativity is bad, violent, and destructive, while \\"Blessed are the positive!\\" is beatitude in US civil religion.<br /><br />Plenty of non-USians had been telling me that they felt attacked and aggressed upon by US \\"positivity.\\" My initial temptation was to dismiss their complaint as negativity or pessimism. However, listening to what they felt, I learned that having a positive attitude was not itself the problem. They felt that they were being judged, that their US interlocutor was taking a one-up or arrogant stance toward them. I had overlooked the fact that both positive and negative evaluations can be violent communication forms. Both play into the our addiction to judgment and dichotomous thinking. We fail to observe that the messages, \\"Great job,\\" and \\"You screwed up,\\" are identical acts of violence, the subtext being, \\"I judge you,\\" whether the judgment be positive or negative.<br /><br />Also often missed is that the injunction to be positive can be a power play used to neutralize opposition to one's ideas and plans. Criticize me, or look on the negative side of what I am doing or saying, and you are no longer my friend. We experience this on a daily basis, and recently saw it writ large, in US policy toward those countries that refused to support the US invasion of Iraq. While Rosenberg's book does not address the cultural phenomenon of US \\"positivity\\" directly, reading it that gave me the impetus to look for the feelings and the needs in people's reaction to the aggressive use of the \\"be positive\\" principle.<br /><br />It is not surprising that there is a national crisis of self-esteem when empowerment based on judgment is a norm of communication. As some critics of the drive for self-esteem in the California school system pointed out, self-esteem comes from acknowledged accomplishment and a growing sense of one's own competence, something that no number of feel-good strokes can replace. Particularly since USians believe they are defined by what they do rather than who they are and where they come from, there is an insatiable thirst for identity via accomplishment. Respect, not being dissed, is the yearning; positivity is the palliative. In this light, NVC can be without question an important tool for healing in the USA, as it teaches the attitudes as well as the practices that help us genuinely respect others as well as ourselves.<br /><br />In the past 50 or so years we have discovered or become conscious of language is the tool by which we create things in the first instance. Tangibles flow from intangibles. We construct and deconstruct with words. We can use them to create powerful visions and dreams. But the words create chimeras unless the intentionality and commitment to what we say is furthered by what we do and how we relate to each other. Power leads to the illusion that when we say, \\"Let there be light,\\" there will be light. However, being mortal, our sound bytes and adverts, propaganda and spin require closer examination, something they rarely receive in the general fog of okayness we strive to maintain. When some years ago, Richard Nixon uttered his famous denial of dishonesty by saying, \\"What I said then is now inoperative,\\" many of us got our first clue as to the possibility that big lies could happen here as well as elsewhere in the world. NVC is a call to use the creative power of words compassionately and ethically. Much still needs to be done to see how it can be more broadly applied in public life.<br /><br />The need to decide who is good and who is evil, to judge, and then to act, drives our national ethos to a stark \\"good guys vs. bad guys\\" paradigm of reality, personal, economic and political. Rosenberg astutely notes how we, \\"having learned that the bad guys deserve to be punished, take pleasure in watching this violence.\\" It is this addiction that we are struggling with daily as USians, particularly now that geopolitical and economic stress have become a constant. Self-righteousness arouses a latent Schadenfreude that relishes misfortune almost anywhere and anytime. We live in a time of small and great religious wars. Mastering NVC can keep us from turning observations and desires into non-negotiable absolutes, to keep the brush fires of disagreement from becoming deadly firefights.<br /><br />A few words from the interculturalist side... Separating observation from evaluation has long been recognized as essential to working across cultures. For people in my profession, NVC can contribute substantially to success at expatriation and global teamwork. There are only occasional notes in Nonviolent Communication about how local values affect how NVC is practiced in other cultural contexts. The international distribution of NVC practitioners and programs offers a very rich field for international understanding that deserves exploitation on a larger scale. Capturing NVC challenges, solutions, best practices and learnings as its core technology is applied around the world would be an exciting undertaking and a rich contribution to how we generate cultural competence. The next doctoral candidate I lay my influenceon will get steered in this direction.<br /><br />As to the book itself, it is highly readable, definitely value for the money. Each chapter gives the reader the opportunity to grasp the principles explored by asking them to assess a list of statements in terms of their non-violent quality. Linear flow is relieved with occasional poetry or metaphor to remind us that there is beauty in what we are learning to practice. Key insights are visually highlighted so that you can flip through the book for a refresher course in a few minutes.<br /><br />It will be good for the world's trouble spots to know that Nonviolent Communication and not just tear gas canisters and weapons bear the cachet \\"Made in the USA.\\"xon uttered his famous denial of dishonesty by saying, \\"What I said then is now inoperative,\\" many of us got our first clue as to the possibility that big lies could happen here as well as elsewhere in the world.

B00064MW6A|1.0|I'm a longtime comic-book lover, and I anticipate every theatrical adaptation with equal amounts of excitement and dread.  Some films, like \\"Superman\\" and \\"Spider-Man,\\" manage to capture the complete essence of the character in such a way that the whole absurdity of what's actually HAPPENING is lost in the magic of the story.  Good special effects are certainly part of this, but we believed Superman could fly (via an awkward harness) long before a CG Spider-Man swung from the NYC rooftops. <br /> <br />Having set the bar for comic-book/cinema translations then, let me just say that \\"Catwoman\\" was pure crap.  No fault to Halle Berry, either: she's a fine actress, worthy of Oscar accolades and other heady awards.  No, sadly, it was everything ELSE that sucked about this movie:  the plot premise, the writing, the leather bra...even the special effects were off, as if they alone were saddled with the chore of saving this cinematic turd, and they couldn't quite get the job done.  There's nothing here that captures in any way the comic-book complexity of the character of Catwoman, and that's what makes these types of films sink:  the expected notion that all you have to do is put an actor in a costume and let 'er rip.  No, no, no...there's a whole CHARACTER in there that's dying to get out!  Even \\"Elektra,\\" which wasn't GREAT, had clarifying moments when you got beneath the surface and discovered more to the actress than (another) bad leather bra.   <br /> <br />If you need your Halle fix, check out \\"X-Men\\" or \\"Monster's Ball\\" or even the older \\"Boomerang.\\"  Don't waste your DVD laser on this garbage.
0553573411|5.0|\\"Royal Assassin\\", a book with a tremendous and growing reputation, defies attempts to summarize its greatness.  People love it, critics laud it, but few can truly say why it's so great.  The story starts with Fitz and Burrich in the mountain kingdom recovering from their injuries at the end of \\"Assassin's Apprentice\\".  Fitz flirts with the idea of running off to forge a new life elsewhere, but a Skill dream draws convinces him not to forsake his promise to King Shrewd.  This rapid shifting of Fitz's attitudes keeps up throughout the novel.  And well it should.  Those who are in their middle teens or accurately remember their middle teens know them as years of mental shifting.  You feel desperate and depressed one minute, calm the next, then full of rage.  I can barely name any novel that so captures teenage moodiness and its draining consequences as well as \\"Royal Assassin\\". <br /> <br />In any case, the world will not wait for Fitz to sort out his emotions.  Forged ones converge on Buckkeep, Red Ship Raiders attack in renewed numbers, Prince Regal schemes to overthrow his brother, Molly returns beset with her own emotional storms, and a new wit-bonded wolf puppy demands his attention.  In the midst of all this turmoil, Fitz will have to struggle with his feelings, his loyalties, his priorities, and his relationships. <br /> <br />\\"Royal Assassin\\" defies all expectations.  Like a great jazz improvisation performance, it has its own rhythms, but then takes you on surprising turns that you don't see coming.  Rather than going for the predictable pattern where every event getting neatly wrapped up before the next event begins, here one crisis piles up on top of the next one and the total hits an almost unbearable pitch.  I can't explain it better, I'm afraid, but in the end \\"Royal Assassin\\" is what it is, a top notch epic fantasy about an entire nation convulsing between its own decay and external attack, told entirely through one single unforgettable character.  It never condescends to the reader or grows hubrisitc.  I'm making my second journey through the Farseer trilogy now, and I can say without hesitation that nobody alive does it better than Robin Hobb.
B00005V9HH|5.0|Kevin Spacey won an Oscar for his work in this movie.  Everything this man touches turns to gold, as far as I am concerned.

B0006399FS|5.0|I think I fell off of the U2 bandwagon somewhere around Rattle and Hum. I have no idea what Achtung Baby and all the 90's stuff sounded like. I picked this up because I'd heard it was gonna be great.  First play I sort of shrugged my shoulders and said, yep, that's U2.  But now I can't stop playing it. Lots of energy, passion, and possibly some of Bono's finest lyric writing \\"Freedom has a scent like the top of a newborn baby's head\\"  That's pretty cool.  If you are schooled in Biblical scripture you will pick up references from the Gospels all over the place - Vertigo has a reference to the story of the devil tempting Christ from the top of the Temple - \\"All this can be yours\\" in a tune called Vertigo - get it?  Love the pun.<br /><br />This disk is very overtly Christian without being corny about it, lots of reference to what I believe is the lost message of Jesus - Love your neighbor as yourself and life is an incredibly tough row to hoe but you don't have to go it alone.<br /><br />Another great line:<br /><br />As you enter this life<br /><br />I pray you depart<br /><br />With a wrinkled face<br /><br />And a brand new heart.<br /><br />Powerful, passionate music, great lyrics, wonderful message... What more do you want?
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This documentary was out of this world.  You get a first hand account of how certain wars in our country's history were decided upon and in some instances bungled with many lives lost... all because of greed, excessive amount of control and lack of simple communication.  Robert McNamara ought to be ashamed of himself for what he helped to achieve during his time in the white house ... and judging by how much he cried in the film he is ashamed.
B00005LOLD|5.0|Sayonara is a story that was bold in the 1950s but to those of us living in the 21st century, it may seem old and outdated.  Some of it may be a little casual - the lack of serious Japanese male actors, but the central theme of the story is still important.  Marlon Brando, Red Buttons and James Garner are Americans, assigned to Japan after combat in Korea, with interests in Japanese women.  Brando has an American fiancee whom it is apparent he is ambivilent about marrying - he seems to have been engaged for a very long time.  Garner, as a Marine aviator, has a Japanese lady friend who is a professional dancer and Buttons his fiance that he wants to marry - regardless of the rules that make it difficult if not impossible to have a successful marriage.<br /><br />Brando coming to Japan from Korea needs a break.  He is starting to be troubled by what he is doing.  He remarks to Buttons that  one of his most recent aerial victories was over a man with a face.  Appparently his previous victories were done at a long enough range that it didn't become so personal.  This time it was different and is staying with him.<br /><br />I think it it the story of Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki that is the most pivotal part of the story.  They have the courage to get married and face the future as a couple.  Brando's ambivilance to his fiancee finally causes him to walk away from her and hook up with Garner in the officer's club bar.  They had become acquainted when Garner attempted to bring his Japanese guest into the officer's club and was refused permission to do so.  Through Garner, Brando becomes interested in another famous professional dancer, Miiko Taka, and he begins a quest to meet her.  He asks Buttons and Umeki to introduce him to Hana Ogi and the initial attempt is less than successful.  Hana Ogi says she doesn't talk to Americans because during the war her brother and father were killed by the Americans.  Brando is astonished by this thinking as he says he didn't kill them (guilt by association) and then Garner adds a telling and resonating comment \\"yes you did, we all did\\".  Garner's role understands that in the eyes of Japanese all Americans participated in the leveling of Japanese cities and the starvation of the people through submarine warfare.  It didn't matter if the servicemen they saw were in Europe during the war or were even to young to have fought there but were doing their two years service obligation (draft).  At their first meeting she is stiff but soon becomes comfortable in Brando's presence.<br /><br />Buttons has become the center of a campaign to transfer enlisted men who have married Japanese women and gets orders to return to the US.  Brando, one of the few people he respects, tries to get the orders changed without success.  Even the pregnancy of Button's wife has no effect on the decision.  Faced with a life of seperation, suicide is their answer.  This is after Umeki has the idea of having her eyelids slashed so that after the surgery they look like an AMerican woman.  It is sad and frustrating to think that in the real world it was done as the flyer described that Umeki had in her hands.  The musical accompaniment to Brando finding their bodies is extremely moving in this scene and is something I have remembered since I first saw this movie over forty years ago.  Brando's performance as the grief stricken friend is superb - you can almost feel his pain and then anger as his ex-future father-in-law general tells him that the law is being changed and soon men like Buttons can bring Japanese wives to the US.  It is a little late for Buttons and his wife though.<br /><br />After the deaths of thier friends, Hana Ogi is moved to Tokyo by her company (afterall no matter how popular she is with the public, she is still an employee) Brando follows and it is there that they decide to face the offical displeasure of both countries and marry although it is extremely difficult for Hana Ogi to make the decision to turnher back on age old customs and traditions.  Hana Ogi's description of how she came to be a dancer is chilling.  I think she sees the difficult future much more clearly than Brando's character. yet they both are willing to take the risk.<br /><br />There is another relationship that isn't discussed and that is the role of Eileen Webster (Brando's fiancee) and the kabuki dancer Nakamura.  She has dinner with him, both with and without Brando and the topic of Brando's relationship with a famous Japanese dancer is discussed and in Nakamura's case discounted.  Yet when Brando makes the announcement to the Webster family that he wants to marry a Japanese woman, Eileen walks out.  Her mother asks her to stay and talk and Eileen responds that the only person she wants to talk to is Japanese - Nakamura.  This could have been a much more intriguing situation.  It was relatively common for American men to date and marry Japanese women.  What would the reaction have been to the developing relationship between a Japanese man and an American woman?  I think that has more societal impact for the late 1950s than an American man and Japanese woman.<br /><br />Throughout the film the entire cast is extremely effective, from Buttons' enthusiasm over his future wife to Garner's anger at not being able to take a Japanese guest into the Officer's club.  It all feels quite real.  Look at the small details as Brando is waiting for Taka as she passes over a bridge every day to her performance.  He makes an impression on her inspite of her resistance.  This is a look at Japanese culture as well as the US military culture.  Ricardo Montalban as a kabuki actor is exceptional - he deserved an academy award nomination as well as Buttons.  James Garner is also exceptional as the Marine Corps aviator who is at first antagonistic to Brando but later introduces him to Japan outside of the officer's club.  His performance is very under rated and deserves much greater praise.<br /><br />The musicalscore of the movie is outstanding and has a very positive impact on the film scenes.  Without this score I'm not sure how well the film would have been.<br /><br />Oddly enough, some of the same themes from this film are resonating in my personal life as I am living in Japan.  Some of the same issues that are raised in the film were ones that my wife to be had after I asked her to marry me.  The issue of children especially resonated and still does from time to time.  Her concern about what the child will be and all I can say is that it will be ours.  I showed Rumi the last few minutes of the film and it had a powerful impression on her.  It also showed her that her questions and concerns were not unique - that they have been discussed and argued over for decades.<br /><br />It is a movie that does not end happily - maybe it ends hopefully is a better summary, as Brando and Taka take on the officials of Japan and the US.  You think it will work but you don't know for sure.<br /><br />Another point to think about is that in the 40s and 50s - a number of states had laws that forbid bi-racial marriages.  A friend of my father's in the Navy had orders to a state where such a law was in operation and had to leave his Japanese wife and bi-racial son in Japan while he was doing his assignment in the US.  The best the Navy could do was to give him as short an assignment as possible in the US and then hopen to get him back to Japan close to it - Guam, Korea, The Philippines or Vietnam.  If Brando could take his Japanese wife back to the US - would he run afoul of state laws forbidding bi-racial marriages since many bases of the US military were located in the states where these laws were on the books - if not enfource.<br /><br />This is a must see film for anyone interested in the military of the 1950s and the impact on Japan of the US and vice versa.
B00000K19E|5.0|This by far is one of the top movies of all time.  The second and 3rd installments don't even come close to the first Matrix.

The show has elements of anything you can think of: romance, suspense, drama, comedy (sorry to whoever used this same thing before!)<br /><br />And I'm overjoyed that 'Desperate Housewives' will get its DVD debut in August 2005! Thank goodness!<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a laugh, a cry, or just a look at a wonderful show, tune into ABC for DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES.
B000002I2G|1.0|Trash. Schlock. The Doors with an orchestra????<br /><br />When this album first came out, When I first heard it in 1969, I had an overwhelming feeling of personal betrayal. After the spectacular, \\"Doors\\", & \\"Strange Days\\", the good \\"Waiting for the Sun\\", this....<br /><br />In retrospect, the Doors were like many other groups, Jim wrote poems for years, before they became popular, before there was The Doors. The early gems were spread through the first three album. All new material. Here the muse had stopped! (Altho that Spirit did return, to some extent, for \\"Morrison Hotel\\" and \\"LA Woman\\".)<br /><br />Worst of all The Doors albums, for completeists only!<br /><br />Caveat Emptor. Just trying to save your money. Buy ANY of the other wonderful Doors album before this.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|As I write, I'm listening to \\"Hysteria\\" through a set of premium headphones. This is music folks. Real, real and true music. Haunting, lyrical, melodic, lingering. This album is relentless start to finish. If you're a fan of Radiohead, like rock and alternative, are into some experimental stuff, this is a must have. There are hints of classical themes throughout, which I found interesting being an avid classical music lover myself.<br /><br />I first came across Muse when I accidentally heard \\"Space Dementia\\" and thought it might of been some crazy Radiohead B-side - I was shocked to learn it was another band, the similarities are REALLY there. But I'm glad I found my Muse :)
6300216543|4.0|Serpico is quite a gripping movie.  Al Pacino plays a police officer who has numerous battles within the bureacracy of the NYC Police Department.  When Pacino attempts to report unsavory police conduct to the higher ups, he faces much resentment from many angles.<br /><br />The plot of the story has several intriguing twists and turns that manage to keep the viewers hooked in spite of a sometimes sluggish pace.  Its interesting to note how Pacino(Serpico)gives such a haggard appearance as a police officer/detective.  Also quite alarming is the way police officers can be so tempermental to differing points of view.<br /><br />Like the title of my review states, this is a fascinating character study as well as a gripping story.
B000669GAI|4.0|I started listening to Pearl Jam when Ten came out and lost track of them after No Code. Although this compilation leaves some of my favorite songs out from those albums, it gets things right for the most part. I was especially glad to see \\"Immortality\\" included. Also, I have always found the sound on Ten to flatter than the rest of the albums, but the remixes of \\"Once\\", \\"Alive\\" etc... seem fuller and more rounded, and I could even understand some lyrics that I had been puzzling over for years. Generally this compilation seemed heavy on the early years, which may have been when Pearl Jam did their best work (I can't be sure since I only listened to them then), but I was very happy to hear songs from Yield and beyond that I haven't had the chance to get in touch with. Overall, I am not sure if this album would suit an avid fan who has every album, mainly because not much of the material is obscure, but for a novice or someone in my position who listened to Pearl Jam during the early years (or vice versa) this is a great find!

0760316414|4.0|When I first looked into this book at a bookstore, I thought it was an interesting read, but it seemed a little vague. I eventually brought it months later and I have to admit that it's actually pretty good. They nicely intergrated everything into sections, such as the history of car design, current car design leaders and drawing techniques. The whole thing looks professional and is nicely told all around. It really is a good read.    One thing that did bother me, and also contributed to the 4-star rating rather than 5, was that the drawing techniques and tutorial section had been ripped off from wwwDOTcardesignnewsDOTcom    If you only want to buy the book for the drawing lesson, just head to the site I mentioned. It has the EXACT tutorials the book has, and for free!
B000002H70|5.0|Para mi, sin dudas es una de las grabaciones postumas de la historia de la musica contemporanea.Es junto al Unknown Pleasures de Joy Division el Disco mas emotivo de la historia. <br />Es personal,provoca catarsis, piel de gallina y ojos llenos de lagrimas desde la primera cancion hasta la ultima y despues de escucharlo te deja totalmente sedado y conmocionado.En este disco pusieron toda la carne en el asador (y el cerebro),por algo Robert Smith no habla al respecto sobre las letras dejando en claro la compenetracion que hubo en el asunto.En el Greatest Hits deberian haber sacado una version doble con el Disintegration entero...EL MEJOR DISCO JAMAS GRABADO.

B000148KK2|1.0|As a long time devoted Dianna Krall fan, I was terribly disappointed in her latest effort. The CD has none of the mind stiking brilliance of her earlier work. Perhaps Elvis should just stick to being her husband, and leave her alone in her writing.
B00005JNEI|3.0|Either you love him or you hate him, but there's one thing you can't forget while viewing this movie and that is this is not a fair movie, meaning there is no side defending the Bush administration and their actions and Micheal Moore has admitted this, not in these exact words, but this is a man who chased Charleton Heston out from a room in his own home so you can't be upset while watching Fahrenheit 9/11's Moore antics. This is a fearless man.<br />The reason this review misses two stars is there was something strange with the delivery of this movie. It deffinately clouds  the mind with emotion. For instance the begining of this movie begins with the haunting audio of the chaos and confusion on the streets of NY just moments after the attack so immediately my heart sank straight to my stomach. Then we see President Bush's reaction when the news was delivered to him during a visit to an elementry school in the middle of a book, which he sits, visibly confused, and decides to continue the story he began with the children and yes, perhaps he could have, or should have, explained to the children that the president is a busy man and apologize for his must needed departure. Then again this is a man who can barely speak infront of adults, would he have sent these children into a panic had he actually opened his mouth? Perhaps he made the best possible decision that he, himself, could handle. Michael Moore made too big a deal out of this in my opinion, and I am NOT defending the President, and I would be the last to.<br />Visually, this movie will break your heart, frustrate and anger you. From the Iraqi man holding the deceased baby, the greif and sorrow of the woman whose son was killed in battle, the story of the Iraqi American being detained in the prisons. Yes, these are unjust,horrible and shameful crimes. I was and am appauled. I walked around for days frustrated all over again as I was after 9/11, after the start of the war and after his re-election (which I was no part of). Then I watched a few other documentaries reguarding the Bush administration, one that stands out is Mark Crispin Miller's A Patriot Act and something dawned on me. From a Patriot act I walked away pretty informed, from Fahrenheit 9/11 I walked away really mad and upset. Did Michael Moore just pull on me what he claims to despise and blame the media for, and that is cramming my eyes with the blood soaked footage of the war and 9/11 to make an opinion for me as the news delivers unfavorable images of minorities and people of poverty to make panic and opinions for those who are ignorant to circumstance? For profit? I'm not saying he's wrong in what he's \\"saying\\", he is very right. However,I dislike a hypocrite, and apparantly no one knows an American like Michael Moore. So let's be careful.<br />I do give him great credit for his fairness to the military. At first you'll be horrified to see some Marines blood thirsty, ready and excited to fight and kill and at the music they listen to while in battle. Then there are those Marines who are deffinately doing their duty, but either frightened, repulsed, confused and one in particular taking a stand in reguards to this war. He balanced this completely fair.<br /> Over all I will say this is deffinately one worth watching. But if you're like me, a house wife with raising kids as your main thought pattern, then you may want to watch this movie twice because this is the type of movie where the visuals cloud your mind with emotion and strongly overshadow the actual information.t of).

0375701427|5.0|This is one of Roth's best novels. The story is told with great narrative power, the characters are drawn with great sympathy and understanding. The question the moral question of the novel is how the All- American boy who does everything right , and seems to make it all work has his life turned upside down and his daughter become a political radical completely estranged from what her parents stand for. The novel is long and I could have done without the prolonged description of the glovemaking industry. Its good to know that a twentieth century novelist can write a nineteenth century novel, but it does not seem to me of vital necessity. All these writers filling their books with factual descriptions of some particular industry seem to be imitating Melville's whale industry stuff, and seeking a kind of grand status as chroniclers of the whole society .Balzac in Bayonne, and Tolstoy in Teaneck are just not necessary. So I found the whole thing a bit long but there was much compensation. I will point to what for me is the best part of the novel and it seems to me one of the funniest and best pieces of American writing I know. Roth's description of his high- school reunion was for me  the most poignant and funny part of this work. And here I would just say that despite all my reservations about so many different sides of Roth, political religious etc. I still find him to be the funniest writer I have ever read and as his best unbeatable. This work contains some of that Roth very best stuff, and I could not more highly recommend it.
0552149519|1.0|This book is a page turner. But:<br /><br />As you read this nonsense, you'll feel more and more like an idiot. At cost to your self-image, you'll go on because Brown has the tricks: like cliff-hangers at every chapter close, and intertwining story lines at key moments.<br /><br />Unfortunately, many (maybe most) of his \\"facts\\" and \\"history\\" are either inventions or half-truths. So there is absolutely zero learned from this read. In fact, there's less than zero, because you'll walk off with wrong ideas. Brown needn't parade fiction as fact. That's a disservice to the reader and also to Brown's profession, which should not add to the world's misconceptions, even where the main goal is entertainment.
630460291X|4.0|Yes, I know Costner doesn't sound like a Brit.  I forgot about that pretty quickly as the story unfolded.  The cast is engaging and works well together--particularly Costner with both Morgan Freeman as his faithful sidekick Azeem and all Robin's merry men.  <br /> <br />I particularly loved Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham.  This is one of his best roles.  He's funny, tragic, depraved.   <br /> <br />I wish the sound had been redone for the digital release, but otherwise, this film is excellent.  It's one you should have in your collection so you can watch it again and again.
0156027321|5.0|Read the reviews. Don't form an opinion. Buy the book. Read it. Read it till the last page. Do a casual reading. I bet you will be tempted to read it again (atleast some parts of it). <br /> <br />The story would appeal to the philosophist in you, the fiction-lover in you, the fantasy-seeker in you, the religious-debater in you and YOU (whoever you may be). <br /> <br />Life of pi (it has nothing to do with the mathematical sign Pi) is more a journey than book.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|When I first saw Napoleon Dynamite in theaters I was a little disappointed because after hearing about how funny it was I was expecting a bit more. However towards the end of the movie I had begun to appreciate its own unique sense of humor. After seeing the movie the first time, it grew on me and I had to see it again. Now thats it on dvd I have already watched it many times and have enjoyed every minute of it. This is one of those movies that if you like it, you will want to own it to be able to whip it out at anytime to show to your friends, etc... Anyway I highly recommend this movie as it is now one of my favorite films of all time.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|Easily the most disturbing thing about this fantastic film is the fact that not one American reviewer realises that the main thing this film is satirising is You.  Yes You.  It is taking the p**s out of the way the rest of the world sees America and the role that Americans seem to think they have in the world.  Your ignorance of other cultures, your gung-ho attitude to everything and your belief that \\"The American way\\" is the only way.  Now, im sure many Americans disagree with this & I have met a couple of you who arent all those things.  Only a couple though.  Im sure your now thinking im some whining liberal but I can assure you im not.  I fought with American forces in both Afghanistan & Iraq and am still in the British Royal Marines.  The American forces, whilst I respect anyone with the balls to fight for their country, are in a different league from any other country ive worked with when it comes to mindless destrution & alienating local people in whatever part of the world they are in.  I dont know whether Trey Parker & Matt Stone are pro-war or anti-war, they seem to be just anti-idiot to me.  Unfortunatly for you, you are percieved by the rest of the world as Idiots. <br /> <br />Ill finish with a quote from the film. Its so clever in its subtlety that I can understand how Americans could hear it & not get its true meaning.  Please think about it again, the quote is \\"America is a dick.\\"
0141439831|5.0|This book is on my list of all-time favourites.  It is a novel that exposes social hypocrisy  and sham, and a social satire of Thackery's era.  It was written in the mid-nineteenth century.  This book is often referred to as \\"a novel without a hero\\".  It does not in fact have a male hero, but it does have a wonderful female creation.  Becky Sharp is a brilliant fictional creation.  The novel covers so many different areas of society and Becky's effect on them and their effect on her as she moves through the story.  We see many different ways of life from this time, and they are portrayed so very well.  The elements that we see are army society, city merchants' society, country gentlefolk's society, genteel poverty, fashionable society, life below stairs, and we see them all so clearly.  Most remarkable of all, Thackery's heroine's profound effect on her readers is so different than what we are normally used to.  Becky has no redeeming human qualities at all.  She is a liar, a hypocrite, ungrateful, dishonest, mercenary and mean.  But these qualities make her appear so real because the reader is aware throughout what kind of person that she is.  We are under no illusions.  I could go on and on because I love this book so, but you need to read this wonderful novel for yourself.
B0006399FS|1.0|Success guaranted, although this is their worst effort ever.   U2 are now no more than a fond memory.     We weren't informed about this. Ratter, we were informed about an outstanding collection of songs we didn't find when we had to listen to it. An unhappy commercial move. A ridiculous album, a ridiculous hype. Did they need to do all this ?.    We are sending the bill to U2, that's the only thing we can do after being trated as dogs.

B000001EAQ|5.0|I agree this album should have been their last one. It's just full of details, magic, exciting moments, variety, dramatic moments, brand new experimental music, colors, etc.   The mainstream U2 2000 have just one color: The dollar bills one.    This album, unlike All That You Can't Leave Behind, stood the test of time. Listen to Mofo. That's a real Rock tune, miles away from the silly iPod commercial yeah yeah yeah \\"Vertigo\\", their most childish song ever.    Discotheque, Do you Feel Loved, Staring At The Sun, Please, Last Night On Earth, Wake Up Dead Man, Gone, etc. All are standouts tracks, unlike filler numbers as Grace, Wild Honey, One Step Closer, Original Of The Species, Love And Peace, A Man And A Woman, etc.    I won't support this sold out iPod band, I will support 80's and 90's U2.     Are you ready for Pop ?... warning... is their Sgt Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band... you won't find any other album like this one !!!!
B00003CXSM|3.0|I just saw this movie on DVD after almost 4 years of trying.  It is so funny in most parts.  Jennifer Lopez did probably more than a dozen movies during this time and this is a good venture into comedy.  She is so funny on most of the scenes as she's trying to defend her wedding planner job.  It's kind of sketchy later on as she can't decide if she wants to go with the man played by Matthew (can't spell his last name right) or that other goofy guy in the movie.  The review says they're all too nice.  But I think that no one wants to step on each other's toes and reveal something.  Lopez is more of a dramatic actress, but this was a good first effort into comedy. There's a little dance scene reminiscent of what she did with Richard Gere in last year's Shall We Dance? She and Matthew don't connect well until an hour into the movie. And some dull sections should have been removed. It is a funny movie for its romantic lilt.
0143034901|5.0|This is one of the most enjoyable books I have read in two years. Its plot line is complicated, with one life paralleling a generation earlier life. At times it is hard to follow which life is being talked about. A character in the story,Fermin, has some very funny observations about the human condition. Actually worth a reread.
0553801511|4.0|Golden Fool is clearly a building exercise to book three, Fool's Fate.  While the transition from book one to book two was clean, books two and three are really halves of the same book.  You can't take a break between them because so much is left in the moment at the end of Golden Fool. <br /> <br />There are a few major plot lines that run through Golden Fool, however Hobb interweaves them with long wavelengths, such that one plot line is left hanging for very many chapters while another is addressed, and you being to stop caring about the other plot line, and even wondering if Hobb plans to pick it back up at all. <br /> <br />I was also disappointed at the lack of another Fitz witbond.  His Wit usage was always one of the most interesting aspects of the books, and the current disuse leaves a void in the story.
0156027321|5.0|The first part of the book was a bit difficult to get through...it was dry and a little boring and I had a hard time staying focused on what was happening. Try and stick with it though - its worth your patience! There is so much humor and emotion in this book; when I finished reading, I felt very emotional. I would recommend this book to anyone!
B00005RYKU|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters probably when it first came out in 2001, but I didn't pay too close attention, because I forgot about it. However, I remembered seeing it in theaters one day when I was browsing the DVD section, and decided to give it another shot at home. I am so glad I did! Leelee Sobieski is absolutely gourgeous and did a flawless job with the film. She has a bright future in acting ahead of her. Basically what happens is, Ruby (Sobieski) and her brother Rhett's (Trevor Morgan) parents die in a car accident. Their parents wished for them to go live with the family's former neighbors, the Glasses, (who had since moved to Malibu) played by Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane. Needless to say, Ruby and Rhett's carefree lives are changed dramatically. Rhett falls for all the gifts that the Glasses buy for him, but Ruby isn't fooled so easily. She begins to suspect that her parents' death wasn't an accident, and starts to investigate. She sees certain things and observes certain behaviors exhibited by the Glasses that only make her more suspicious. Eventually, she figures out that the Glasses are behind the car accident and are now after Ruby and Rhett's 4 million dollar fortune that was left to them by their parents. I won't give away the rest, but the movie takes you on a roller coaster ride of excitement and suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the last second! Rent it, or better yet, buy it! It's well worth your while!
B0002XDODU|5.0|This album is definitely Rammstein's best - it is impossible to stop playing it!! I really liked the first three albums, but this one is better. Every song has a distinct sound, ie. the songs on this album are less repetitive sounding compared with earlier albums. You hear some of the typical Rammsteins-sounds but also some great new tunes. 'Amerika' and 'Moskau' are my favorite, there are no disappointing songs on this album. Great job, guys!!
0553260111|5.0|This book is probably the most famous of Ludlum's many books.  The gimmick that made this book the most noteworthy of Ludlum's books is that the protagonist Jason Bourne is suffering from amnesia.  He awakens with no memory of who he is.  He follows clues and his periodic 'remembrances' and finds that he is a marked man and trained assassin.  He literally dodges bullets for the next 500+ pages. <br /> <br />The book moves quickly, has some great twists, and fantastic action sequences.  I can definitely see how this book inspired the movie, which aside from the amnesiac is nothing like the book.  The book also has the annoying love interest springing from absolutely impossible circumstances.  There are some loose ends to the story, but I'm sure those are dealt with in the next two Bourne books.  Still, if you like the action thrillers this should be high on your list.  Worth the read.
B00004W52U|5.0|As \\"tri-zeta\\" said, this album will be played 50 years from now, and I firmly believe that. I know oldschool 80s punks who are now in their 30s who have given up the lifestyle and the music, but they STILL to this day listen to OpIvy's \\"Energy.\\" There's a ton of songs on this album, and trust me, not a single song is bad or below-average. Every single song has an awesome message and sound that cannot be replicated or duplicated or surpassed. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and get this album. While you're at it, grab Minor Threat's complete discography and a few Misfits album, and you'll be set.
0060931671|5.0|This is a relatively easy book to read given the complexities of the Pynchonian oeuvre, but as some people have noticed it is not an easy book to understand. In it, I believe that Thomas Pynchon is challenging both the classical notion of a hidden structure and the modernist notion of a self-created structure. This is the first book in which the author tries to articulate a coordinated human response to being thrown into an apparently indifferent, degenerate Copernican acosmos, a universe without intrinsic values. Because of the book's compact size, nearly linear plot and concentration on a single, central protagonist, 28 year old Oedipa Maas, we are compelled to view her imagined discovery of the dystopian structure, the Tristero, as one way of giving meaning to the entropic disintegration of human life, of finding \\"a reason that mattered to the world,\\" (p. 150). <br /> <br />    Oedipa Maas becomes trapped between the two idealizations of (i) existential power to create, and (ii) gnostic ability to establish values. Oedipa's existential state is exemplified by a painting in the book (mentioned on p. 11) by Remedios Varo, which inverts the Christian creation and tries to construct an independent self; but this only leads to solipsism and narcissism: with the anthropological fear of non-existence, of there being only \\"the void\\" (p. 141). Through another metaphor, that of a slow \\"whirlwind,\\" (pp. 14, 16) we cannot hear the words of revelation because the wind is rotating too slowly (God spoke to Job out of a whirlwind) and so Oedipa tries to construct an alternative source of gnostic value, \\"the languid, sinister blooming of The Tristero,\\" (pp. 39-40) with its symbol of the muted post horn, to mute the trumpets of the Apocalypse through bureaucratic waste; but this only leads her into deeper gnostic paranoia and the self-construction of projected revelation: with the cosmological fear of becoming a machine, \\"a great digital computer\\" (p. 150). <br /> <br />    Byshowing how Oedipa can neither become an independent self, nor can realize her own personal revelation, Thomas Pynchon indirectly re-establishes a route back to reality: \\"the reality principle\\" (p. 111). Oedipa's failure is the failure of her mystical search for charisma, the gift of tongues, \\"the direct, epileptic Word, the cry that might abolish the night,\\" (p. 95) but without the necessary and corresponding rational order of tradition. This one-sidedness provokes Oedipa (and the reader), in the final auction, into an implicated choice between some kind of objective truth and paranoiac self-centering, between the spiritual and the material: thus, the crier, Loren Passerine is \\"the finest auctioneer in the West,\\" (p. 151) but also, maybe \\"a descending angel;\\" (p. 152) an indirect positing of the choice between God and idolatry. However, Oedipa's potential revelation, the \\"high magic to low puns,\\" (p. 105) is a recovery through satire from the stilted, post-romantic pretentiousness of modernism; a passerine is a perching song-bird, \\"Loren Passerine, on his podium, hovered like a puppet-master,\\" (p. 152) about the size of a sparrow.

B000002BHE|5.0|Celine Dion has put out an amazing CD.  I fell in love with \\"Because You Loved Me\\" and used to play it nonstop. Luckily, I stopped playing it so much, giving me the opportunity to play other songs on the CD.  I started listening to \\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\\" and although it's over 7 minutes long, I wanted it to keep going.  So I listened to it nonstop.  Eventually, I listened to every song and loved them all especially \\"Falling Into You\\" and \\"Declaration of Love\\".  Her soothing voice and breathtaking vocal range made this CD so wonderful.  There were quiet, almost cautious measures that were preceded by booming lines.  Celine is spectacular and I suggest that anyone who likes love songs buys this CD.

B0002Z0EYK|2.0|This movie is full of...special effects, mostly computer-generated imagery, which works fine with animation like Finding Nemo.  But for those of us who like movies with real people, weather, and locations, CGI just doesn't cut it.  There is only one real special effect in Troy, and that's Peter O'Toole's performance.  He should get the best supporting actor Oscar because he singlehandedly made this movie watchable.  When he's on the screen, things get real, and he makes the awful dialogue sound Shakesperian.  Other than that, no thanks.  Wolfgang Petersen has no point of view or distinctive style as a director.  Say what you want about Alexander, at least Stone had a vision, as ridiculous as it was at some points.  Eric Bana is a solid actor in the role of Hector, much more appealing than Achilles, and he is also convincing.  Too bad he has to get killed by Brad Pitt, who in his scenes with O'Toole, looks like he wants to run and hide because he's in the presence of an actor.  I don't have anything against Pitt, but he and everyone else knows that he was in this movie just to be ornamental.  If that's what some viewers want, fine for them, but in the end this movie was a product to be put on the market, not a work of passion.
6300263673|3.0|This is one of the worst chick flicks ever. This movie came <br />out in the late 80's and did fit with the time period, but <br />now feels so corny and lame. The plot, the acting, and just <br />about everything. Patrick Swayze always was an overrated <br />actor, and how can you like Jennifer Grey? She seems like <br />a big time whiney snob. The soundtrack helped improve the <br />movie but couldn't save the cheese that this movie reaked. <br /> <br />Honestly, the 80's was a cheesy decade and movies like this <br />and Footloose helped make that so. If you are young you should <br />really pass on these type of movies because they are lame and <br />cheesy despite the good soundtracks.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|I've been a fan of Luc Besson's \\"The Professional\\" of years and the original DVD was one of the most charished in my collection. So imagine my excitement when I picked up my copy of the Deluxe Edition. It was a joy to see the interviews with the cast, especially some of the casting outtakes of Natalie Portman. Her masterful acting is without a doubt the driving force of the movie and I can't fathom anybody else playing the role of Mathilda. But the draw of the dvd is the extra footage, which doesn't disappoint. We get to see Leon show Mathilda the ropes of the Professional business and a touching scene when Leon uses some of his money from Tony to take Mathilda out to a fancy restaurant. There are some instances where it's easy to see why some footage was cut. In one part Mathilda offers to lose her virginity to Leon. I thought this was pushing their relationship in the wrong direction. I guess Luc thought so also and cut it from the final product. A downside to to losing that scene is that we see that Leon refuses her and gives us a glimse into his past and why he came to the U.S. Everyone involved in this film was amazing, from Luc to Natalie to Jean to Gary. The cut and uncut versions of the film are great additions to any DVD collection but I'd recommend this version because it's the way Luc intended it to be. If you love great film making, action, and acting then you must own \\"The Professional\\".
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I randomly picked up this album about a week after its release, having heard great things about it from a friend (who I believe read the Pitchfork review of the album).  Upon listening to it, I was blown away. <br /> <br />The music on this album is a brilliant combination of energetic, melodic, emotional, and innovatively unique tracks.  I listen to it in its entirety no less than twice each week. <br /> <br />What's more, The Arcade Fire puts on an incredible live show.  I first saw them in December of 2004 in San Francisco, and I left the show in awe.  It was one of, if not the most entertaining show I had ever attended.  I had made sure to pick up a copy of their earlier EP, which as far as I know, is only available at their live shows. <br /> <br />Just last week (Jan 12 & 13, 2005, specifically), I saw the group perform again, at two of their three shows in San Francisco.  Not only is the music wonderful, but the energy the group has on stage brings a whole other element to their music.  You can tell that the group loves what they do, and their emotional attachment to their music is also apparent (during one show, Regine was crying while she sang 'In the Backseat'). <br /> <br />Buy this album.  See them perform live.  You won't regret it.
B00005ASHM|4.0|I realize that debates over what pop/rock album is \\"the best of all time\\" are pointless; it's a personal choice. MY personal choice would be \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" and apparently a lot of the world agrees, as it was on the Billboard Top Albums list for continuously for nearly 15 years!<br /><br />But this review is about \\"Pet Sounds\\" -- and while I enjoy this album a lot, it has too many flaws to be a serious contender for \\"best of all time.\\"  Specifically: dopey name, faux-Beatles album cover and too many songs that sound basically the same.  If you like well-crafted harmonies, this album is a pleasure. If you appreciate good instrumental work and skilled production, chalk up another couple of points.  But if you want great, deeply insightful lyrics, you'll have to go elsewhere.  Too much of this album is like greeting-card verse set to music.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll get a lot of negative ratings for this review from ardent Beach Boys and Brian Wilson fans, but this is my honest opinion. Enjoy it for what it is - a pop/rock classic with some fun moments - but don't worship it as an iconic achievement.
B00006399Z|4.0|'Welcome To the Canteen' is one of the more intriguing albums to come out of the psychedelic era of rock and roll.  The band wasn't quite as loosely assembled as say the 'Super Session' trio of Stephen Stills, Mike Bloomfield, and Al Kooper, but nearly so.  In-and-out-again Traffic co-founder Dave Mason is in at this point, but only for a handful of concerts.  Frontman Steve Winwood had also augmented the original Traffic line-up with journeyman drummer Jim Gordon, who was making the rounds with Eric Clapton and George Harrison, and percussionist Reebop (wouldn't you love to know if he wears Reebox?).  Once Mason flew the coop this band would be primed to record its seminal work, 'The Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys', but for this moment in time, the stars aligned in a most illuminating way. <br /> <br />Two of the more intriguing tracks on this disc are the Dave Mason compositions, 'Sad and Deep As You' and 'Shouldn't Have Took More Than You Gave'.  Both are stellar works fresh from Mason's 1970 solo debut album, 'Alone Together'.  It's marvelous to hear Mason perform these songs so near to their inception, and with such a fine line-up of backing musicians.  The tempo is slow, but the emotion is high on each.  Chris Wood's flute on 'Sad and Deep As You' is beautifully understated, while Mason's guitar work on 'Shouldn't Have Took More Than You Gave' is stunning.  Reebop and Jim Capaldi's percussion on both songs provide yet another nuanced layer to appreciate. <br /> <br />There are three heavy rock numbers on the disc, each possessing its own unique flavour.  The opener, 'Medicated Goo' is rather fun and funky with sharp, driving guitar riffs.  The two longest tracks on the disc made up the entire second side of the original vinyl version of this release.  'Dear Mr. Fantasy', one of the band's trippiest numbers, lacks some of the psychedelic twists and turns endowed on the studio version, but possesses the finest guitar solo's on the disc.  The closer, 'Gimme Some Lovin', drawn from Winwood's mid-60's stint with 'The Spencer Davis Group', is nearly as percussion heavy as the original single version of the song.  Perhaps the presence of three percussionists in the line-up prompted Winwood to feature this nine-minute extravaganza on 'Welcome To the Canteen'. <br /> <br />The remaining performance is a six-minute plus version of the popular, early Traffic composition '40,000 Headmen'.  I must confess that I've never understood the appeal this song seems to have for many Traffic fans.  A number of versions exist... it turns up on nearly every Traffic compilation and live release there is.  I'm sure the problem must be me, since the song receives frequent accolades in reviews.  With my personal disclaimer in mind, I will say this is one of the more appealing versions of the song I've heard, possessing a smooth acoustic flow.   <br /> <br />The only flaw possessing 'Welcome To the Canteen' is the quality of the recording.  Even given it's unique qualities, I'm a bit surprised Winwood and company saw fit to release these tracks.  The vocals on 'Sad and Deep As You', while clear, sound as though they are being delivered by Mason from a nearby cave.  The vocals to '40,000 Headmen' suffer a similar fate early on.  The vocals on the nearly eleven minute 'Dear Mr. Fantasy', and on 'Gimme Some Lovin' are simply overwhelmed in all the instrumentation.  These flaws give the recording a near-bootleg feel... but at least you know it's real. <br /> <br />'Welcome To the Canteen' was the sixth release by 'Traffic', following three studio albums, one compilation, and one mixed-bag ('Last Exit').  It's an interesting snapshot of a band in deep transition, clearly mutating from their present into their future, yet firmly grounded in their past accomplishments.  The liner notes are rather sparse, and we're not treated to any bonus tracks, though you gotta believe Island Records is sitting on some more gems from the two UK shows these tracks are gleaned from.  One wonders why a CD with only forty minutes of music couldn't be supplemented to woo the faithful.
B000002LBH|4.0|The Smiths wrote many amazing songs, but I've often felt that their albums were somehow lacking. I am a huge fan of band, and in my opinion, this album provides the best introduction to their music available.     The great thing about \\"Louder than Bombs\\" is that it collects some singles and b-sides not on any of their LPs, and a few album cuts from earlier in their career (which was only about 6 years anyway). Some of the best songs on this disc include \\"Is It Really So Strange?\\", \\"Panic\\", \\"William It was Really Nothing\\", \\"Ask\\", and the typically titled \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\\".    The only downside to this collection is the inclusion of the boring instrumental \\"Oscillate Wildly\\" (get it? Oscar Wilde?), and the unlistenable \\"Golden Lights\\", which is a possible contender for Worst Song Ever. Luckily, it's just a cover, so we can't blame The Smiths too much for it.     While The Smith's actual albums would provide a more in-depth (and more expensive) introduction to their music, \\"Louder Than Bombs\\" is an enjoyable overview of some of their best material. Get it, and if you like it, then start into their albums with \\"The Queen is Dead\\" and \\"Strangeways Here We Come\\".
0671027344|4.0|I loved reading this book.  It seems that most coming of age stories have a little something that everyone can relate to--the greatest strength of this work is how it brings its whole story to the level of something the average millenial can relate to. <br /> <br />That being said, I don't believe this work is destined to become a classic.  It seems to be a little bit too much of a product of it's time, while lacking that essential quality to become timeless.  While many interesting things assemble the plot, the ending is a bit hackneyed and predictable. <br /> <br />If you're not afraid to share things like casual pot use, smoking, sex & homosexuality in high schools (all of which except the latter should be pretty tame game by now), go ahead and suggest this book to one of your 80s kids.
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|Gothika is a great scary movie.  Watching it, you just get sucked into it and mesmerized, wondering what will happen next and yet not wanting the movie to end.<br /><br />The setting is perfect.  A mental institution that is every bit as dark and Gothic as Arkam Asylum, home of the criminals and villians in Batman's Gotham City.  In a way, Gothika and the Gotham City mythos are a bit related.<br /><br />In Gothika, it rains.  The rain lends one hundred percent to the mood.  Halle Berry is a brilliant young psychiatrist who works at the institution.  Her husband, also a psychiatrist, is in charge of it.  Berry is treating a young patient with terrible dementia.  Driving home in the rain, Berry has a supernatural encounter with a vengeful spirit.  She is not the same after that, and soon becomes a patient at the same institution where she used to be top staff.<br /><br />The mystery keeps deepening, and Halle plots her escape.  Pulse-pounding, nail-biting, haunting, and beautiful, Gothika is intense.  It will leave you feeling a bit drained, and changed, like Berry's character.<br /><br />The song at the end during the film's final moments you will never forget.<br /><br />A WARNING: GRAPHIC RAPE SCENES MAY TRIGGER ABUSE MEMORIES FOR ANYONE WHO WAS SEXUALLY ABUSED

0446677450|2.0|There are nuggets of wisdom in \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad.\\"  The central point of the book, that \\"the poor work for money, the rich make money work for them,\\" led to an important paradigm shift for me. Instead of investing in assets that use money (a car, a boat), Kiyosaki urges us to invest in assets that make money (stocks, bonds, real estate.) Kiyosaki has important things to say about home ownership -- it is not right for everyone, particularly if you are sinking all of your potential investment money into one home.  He also correctly warns against getting on the treadmill of earning more, then spending more, then needing to earn more, etc.<br /><br />Having said that, the book has too many flaws to really recommend it.  Kiyosaki is no fan of formal education, but unless you are born rich, the only way you can create a stake is by getting a good enough job to enable you to save.  Kiyosaki urges people to form corporations (which pay expenses before they pay taxes), but fails to note the expenses involved, not the least of which is the requirement to pay corporate taxes before distributions are made to shareholders (leading to \\"double taxation.\\")  Kiyosaki discusses the benefits of investing in real estate, but fails to note that being a landlord is not easy and real estate investments are often risky.  And finally, Kiyosaki's allusions to investments open only to insiders is troubling.  I hope he does not mean trading on inside information, which is a violation of the law.<br /><br />I don't know if Kiyosaki really had a rich Dad -- the conversations that \\"Rich Dad\\" supposedly had with nine-year-old Kiyosaki do not ring true.  In the end, it doesn't matter.  Use the book for its kernels of wisdom, but don't tell your boss to \\"take this job and shove it.\\"
B00018D3JQ|5.0|Nouvelle Vague (the album) is a French project to mine 80s Punk and New Wave classics, strip these songs to their bare, and suprisingly beautiful, melodies and have a French female voice perform the vocals originaly sung by a male singer. New Wave and Bossa Nova meet in Nouvelle Vague... the words mean the same thing in their respective languages, and now they are merged in the musical world. These covers are not for everybody, but the songs grow on you with repeated listening. A great chill out choice for those who grew up with the melodies. Endless queries of Who's that? will follow.
B000066AXE|2.0|In the movie 'A Beautiful Mind' we are supposed to understand and sympathize with John Nash as he battles schizophrenia.  But what astounds me about this movie is that it never explains schizophrenia.  Most people still think it's that MULTIPLE PERSONALITY URBAN MYTH.  They might think the imaginary roommate is personality #2.  <br />I must also add that I read the book and the movie and book are extremely different.  The movie is the HOLLYWOOD VERSION.  Most of the stuff in the movie is fictional.
B00005JLEX|1.0|I believed the TV promo for this DVD.  It was advertized as never seen on TV since the original airing.  It also states this on the DVD package. <br /> <br />I have seen every episode at least 10 times.  Don't waste your money on this one.  You can record any episode on the DVD set from TV reruns. <br /> <br />
B00005JN0T|4.0|I always cringe when I see a movie come out that is based on a book I have enjoyed in the past.  I have had too many disappointments from movies such as \\"Planet of the Apes\\" (both versions), \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\\" and \\"Earthsea\\" to not be wary.  There have been pleasant surprises, such as \\"The Stand\\" or \\"The Green Mile,\\" but usually movies based on books are a big risk. <br /> <br />Having said that, I have to admit that Alex Proyas' vision for this story was well worth watching.  He captured the whole conundrum that fans of SF have debated for decades: What constitutes \\"life?\\"  What is intelligence?  What makes a soul? <br /> <br />Will Smith's character, Spooner, has an inherent distrust for robots, but finds in Sonny a friend who is willing to make sacrifices for those close to him, and for the greater good. <br /> <br />I agree that the use of the Three Laws of Robotics made \\"I, Robot\\" the obvious title, but there are also major elements taken from \\"The Humanoids\\" by Jack Williamson and \\"Rossum's Universal Robots\\" by Karel Capek (who actually coined the word, \\"robot\\" in his story.) <br /> <br />The story is fairly tight, and Will Smith is at his wisecracking best.  This is worth more than one viewing.
B0002858YS|5.0|I really enjoy this album beginning to end. There are only a few albums in the last few years that I can say that about. If you like Franz Ferdinand, then you will like this too. It is similar sounding and both bands pull from the 80's pop rock era with their own twist. The guitars and bass are very prominent and drive the songs reminiscent of The Police, U2, Talking Heads, The Cure, etc.
B00005JMH2|5.0|What a great movie. Richard Gere is as gorgeous as usual, and fantastic in the part. So good that I saw it a second time with my 87-year-old mother, and she loved it too.
0553573403|5.0|Let me offer a sort of meta-review.<br /><br />A lot of the reviews offered here are of course quite glowing.  GRRM is doing something very right for a large number of readers.<br /><br />And of course there are dissenters.  Which isn't really a bad thing.  GRRM by, creating a novel that bucks many trends of the genre, will of course turn off a number of readers.  Reading the many good reviews here will probably give you a good idea of whether you will be among those turned off.<br /><br />I think some of the negative opinions go a bit too far however.  Some people find it hard to just say that they didn't like something and instead have to wrap things up as somehow being categorically or definitionally wrong.  For example some might claim that this is just erotica or that the author is trying to shock us with gratuitious sex.  Given the number of people who found a lot more than sex (I barely noticed what offended quite a number of people for example) I think it's safe to say that this is a taste issue, not a fundamental flaw.<br /><br />There are some reviews saying that little happens in this book.  That can be said of all fiction however.  Authors are forced to create subconflicts that only result in greater subconflicts before getting to true resolutions in a climax.  Look at the LotR too closely and you might just notice that the whole story can be summed up: two hobbits take a ring from point A to point B (the whole Aragorn thing is just a ruse TBH, at least if you want to look at the story from a very critical angle).  It's the details that make epic fantasy work and IMO GRRM pulls these off fantastically -- others just disagree.<br /><br />Some will claim that the characters are not sympathetic or are stupid.  Certainly that will be an issue for some.  In deciding to buy this book or not you will have to juxtapose that with those reviews written by many who enjoyed more ambiguous chracterization.  Some like it, some don't.  Others claim that the characters are rip-offs of other work.  I find that hard to justify but maybe that is true for some people.  If you read enough stories you'll almost always find a character that looks like any given other character.  I've read a lot of fiction and I have to say that I didn't feel that was an issue at all.<br /><br />You can't read reviews, especially for a unique series like this, just to see if people or like or dislike the book.  Moreover it's important to see why people do and don't like this series.<br /><br />-Do you mind sex in your fiction?  Sex that is considered immoral?  Graphic descriptions of sex?<br /><br />-Do you find it difficult to identify with characters who screw up and aren't easy to qualify as good or bad?<br /><br />-Would the death of a character you really liked upset you too much to enjoy a novel?<br /><br />-Is the destination of a novel more important to you than the journey?  Would you find it hard to enjoy a book that doesn't provide a strong resolution?  Is waiting 5+ years for the next book in a series too long for you?<br /><br />-Do you greatly prefer fantasy that is chock full of the fantastic?<br /><br />-Do you prefer heroic acts to intrigue, subterfuge, etc.?<br /><br />-Do you prefer a single or only a few points of view?  Would having dozens of active characters distract you too much to enjoy a book?<br /><br />If you answer yes to those then this may not be the series for you.  And that's fine.<br /><br />However I suspect that a lot of us read a laundry list like this and get excited.  And even more of us find that they really like the invigoration that such changes can bring.  I wouldn't have thought that I would like a series that was willing to kill off characters so easily and I was happy to find out just how wrong I was.  So if you the list above doesn't turn you completely off -- then I'd heartily reccommend this series.the characters are rip-offs of other work.

630587493X|5.0|When I first heard of this movie, I thought it just about a robot and his family, plain and simple.  When first saw it on television I found it was much, much more! <br /> <br />Robin Williams is superb in his betrayal about a robot who, by some miracle, becomes \\"aware\\" of life.  We see his desire to learn more about life and become more human as time passes.   <br /> <br />Eventually, he even has the desire to grow old and yes pass on.   <br /> <br />Robin never overplays the role, he is perfect in showing how a \\"being\\" develops and learns about live until eventually it ends.   <br /> <br />The movie is touching, thought provoking, and funny at times.  <br /> <br />Such is life!
0316172324|5.0|I read mysteries for the pleasure of reading, non-fiction to learn. <br /> <br />But, Blink is one of those rare books that combines high momentum engagement and reading pleasure with information of great importance to just about everyone--especially the citizens of a country facing post-9/11 challenges. <br /> <br />Blink addresses crucially important issues of our day--police brutality, bureaucratic intransigence in NASA, Pentagon plans for future war--as well as the millions of times a day citizens make decisions on the basis of invalid assumptions. <br /> <br />Blink's message is simple: learn to trust your \\"thin slicing\\" which permits you to make ACCURATE split-second decisions, but slow down enough to make sure that your split-second decisions are not being biased by previous experience.  <br /> <br />Rapid cognition--split-second decisions--can be both more accurate than 14-months of scientific scrutiny, or they can be tragically misinformed. But, as Gladwell shows, you can educate and exercise your rapid cognition to avoid critical traps.  <br /> <br />As someone interested in psychology, I read Blink with great interest: I learned from it and will definitely strive to \\"slow down\\" when decision-making under pressure.  <br /> <br />But, at the same time, I'm sorry I just finished reading the book. It was that good. Now I have to go back to the CSI videotapes recorded while I abandoned TV for the greater pleasure of reading Blink.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona Apple really can do no wrong. She is one of my favorite artists because not only is her poetic songwriting ability very nearly unparalleled in music today (My derring-do allows me to dance the rigadoon around you/But by the time I'm close to you, I lose/My desideratum and now you) but she also possesses a uniquely powerful voice that she wields like a gun; whether it be pure beauty and simple acceptance (\\"I Know\\") bitterness, hurt and anger (\\"Limp\\") or hopelessness and longing (\\"Paper Bag\\") Fiona makes each song resonate with the listener. There is no filler on this album; every single track is amazing and beautiful and poignant in its own right. Fiona's words and music coupled with the genius of Jon Brion's production make for a spectacular album that I'm still not tired of listening to after nearly six years. Buy this album and treat yourself.
B0002IQHZM|5.0|After listening to Sutras, I was worried that Donovan's career was over. I heard that he did a few live songs that were great, but did not put them on Sutras. He should release those soon. When I thought all was lost, this album appeared, and it is great. Donovan is back and better than ever. The songs Two Lovers, Love Floats, Ying My Yang, and Lover O Lover are fantastic. Donovan is back in the groove. This is an album for everybody.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|This movie disappointed me.  I was already anticipating a movie that was laden with special effects.  I was anticipating insipid humor.  I was still disappointed. Hollywood consistantly uses special effects to compensate for poor plot.  This movie disappointed me considerably.  I anticipated better acting, and an attempt on a plot.  They didn't even try.
0684833395|5.0|It is hard to define exactly what \\"Catch-22\\" is.  At its most basic, it is a book about a squadron of American WWII bomber pilots who fly over Axis territory out of their base in Italy late in the war.  More specifically, it is about one captain who has become all crossed up with the absurdity of the war. <br /> <br />In the end, it struck me as being a book about being able to see the world from fresh perspectives, even when you think you already are.  The ending of the book leaves you feeling strangely excited about the unseen possibilities in life. <br /> <br />A must-read for anyone who enjoys fiction that delves into the philosophical.
B0001DI0FI|1.0|I was hoping for a lot from this movie and it let me down on all counts.  Theres no plot even though it covers several of the books.  My father who read the whole series and has never disliked a movie in my memory said he got he best use of his $8 by walking out of the theater an hour in.  Those who has read the books will appreciate a few glipses of favorite character but thats all you get.  I love Russle Crow but he didnt get much of a chance to act, mainly because there absolutely NO PLOT.  However, it is very beautiful,  if you enjoy amazing shots of tall ships and ocean watch this movie, thats all there is in it.  For me amazing shots of ships in a storm get a little old after an hour, but it just keeps going on, and on and on........
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I can't believe all the bad ratings people have given this. I thought this movie was great. I think the main reason so many had a rough time with it was because they weren't willing to look at this and laugh. You have to be able to laugh at things instead of knowing that you are laughing as a superior, but instead laughing because you know people who are the same or you yourself are the same. Sometimes in life you have to just be able to laugh at things around you and move on, whether that be yourself or a geek beside you.
B000654Z2I|5.0|All the superlatives used in the other reviews here are deserved.  Can were a rare form of beauty in which four virtuosos put their energies together and devoted themselves to that mysterious animal \\"collective improvisation\\", with each player maintaining focus on rhythm and rhythmic intensity.  Singer Damo Suzuki tops off the proceedings with mostly delicate and subtle, and highly unusual, vocal tracks that help to take the music into unexpected places. <br /> <br />As other reviewers note, the second half of this moves into tape-manipulated soundscapes whereas the first half is mostly the sound of delicate, subtle, multi-layered groove.  (See Miles Davis' \\"Bitches Brew\\" for the most clear predecessor).  \\"Oh Yeah\\" is too beautiful for words if you ask me. <br /> <br />On first play of the new CD I was disappointed that this still has sonic limitations.  Well, of course.  It's a two-track master.  On subsequent playback I came to appreciate that they pretty much did the best job possible with the 2-track source material (whereas by contrast Teo Macero was able to preserve 8-track masters for \\"Bitches Brew\\" and engineers were able to drastically upgrade the sound on the recent remaster of that through hard labor).  This is all that is, and will be, and when I lay back and enjoy it it's a real treasure. <br />
0679721037|5.0|\\"Hiroshima,\\" by John Hersey, is a compact (152 pages) but powerful book.  Hersey tells the story of the atomic bombing of the Japanese city of Hiroshima, and of the aftermath of this act.  The subtitle on the book's title page notes that this is a new edition whose final chapter was written 40 years after the fateful blast.  The copyright page further explains that an earlier version of the book was published by Knopf in 1946, and that the new edition was originally published by Knopf in 1985.<br /><br />Hersey's narrative focuses on the experiences of six people: (1) Miss Toshinki Sasaki, a clerk; (2) Dr. Masakazu Fujii, a physician who runs a private hospital; (3) Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, a tailor's widow; (4) Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, a German priest; (5) Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, a young surgeon; and (6) the Rev. Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, a clergyman.<br /><br />The first four chapters follow these people and their associates immediately after the bombing, up to a year later.  The final chapter follows them up into the 1980s.  This is a gripping narrative, written in a sober, straightforward style that I found devastatingly effective.<br /><br />Hersey includes graphic and disturbing details as he discusses the horrific wounds and ailments suffered by the survivors.  Particularly interesting is his description of how the bombing survivors, or \\"hibakushu,\\" were a distinct group who faced unique prejudice and challenges, and had to fight for just treatment.<br /><br />The \\"About the Author\\" section at the end of the book notes that author Hersey taught at Yale for two decades and is a past Chancellor of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.  His description of Hiroshima in the days after the bombing is a powerful portrait of a city gripped by fear and uncertainty.  Also significant are the stories of the paths taken by the survivors in the decades following the blast; I was particularly intrigued by one survivor's odyssey through the United States.  \\"Hiroshima\\" is noteworthy work of American literature, and a reminder of the real human cost of war.orthy work of American literature, and a reminder of the real human cost of war.
B0002Z0EYA|1.0|I got nothing to say but \\"hey man this movie's sucks\\", it's not covered the story Troy as a whole, if you want more comprehensive story, more dramatic, more epic (over than 4 hours watching experience) and more breathtaking fighting scene, get \\" Helen of Troy\\" instead, unless you are Brad Pitt fan, but remember this movie doesn't have much thing to offer.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|How could anyone not find this movie funny? HOW? If you lived in high school, you can relate to this movie. Especially if you can DISTINCLY remember tetherball, trapper keepers, side ponytails, stirrup pants, and puffy dresses at dances/prom... <br />    This is the first EVER movie that I have quoted endlessly. Some of the best lines in any movie ever are delivered by Napoleon and his UBER-dorky brother Kip. <br />    Here is a hint: to truly enjoy the movie, watch it twice with a friend or significant other. For many people, the humor comes later, in recalling and quoting the lines and scenes. I know three people who watched it the first time and said...uhhh how can you find it funny. But then I convinced them to watch it again and we are still laughing. This is probably why critics knocked the movie...they didn't have a good enough sense of humor to enjoy it the first time. <br />    So buy the DVD so you can truly enjoy it! Get on the wagon, because this is then next great cult movie---Move over Rocky Horror Picture Show...Napoleon, Kip, Uncle Rico, Pedro and Deb are taking over the world...\\"Tina, you fat lard come get some dinner.\\" <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|green day fan here.<br /><br />(had the pleasure of being a roadie for these guys many times.)AMERICAN IDIOT is a musical masterpiece. billie joe's voice has matured and they had the balls to try something new. i prefer the first 7 tracks. those are the ones that stick in my head day in and day out. could it be that this cd has subliminal messages to MAKE me want to listen to it EVERY SINGLE DAY??!!?? nope, it's just THAT good. kudos to green day for creating something unique yet still ROCKIN'!!

B00004SVID|4.0|If you sense any disappointment in my title for this review it is because we waited a long time for this (20 years) and it basically sounds the same as the original release.  Although there is some variation and I will always have a place in my heart for the first studio album I ever bought (The Wall)...Great version of Young Lust on this release.  Recommended for the true Pink Floyd fan, would recommend the original release of \\"The Wall\\" to any first timers.
B000002UVX|3.0|When you are listening to this, you come to the conclusion that :   1) Noel Redding was a very underrated bassist.  2) as we know, Mitch Mitchell was indipensable to the Jimi Hendrix' music.  this new band was not good, Buddy Miles is lousy as drummer and i don't like the liquid bass of Billy Cox ; the rhythm section is important in a band, this is not only the guitarist and the front man who makes the sound ; in short, this record is way inferior to the first three albums.
B000000OTY|4.0|I am not the biggest Peter Gabriel fan but I have to give this release a definite thumbs up in sound quality, and overall music.  Some of the bigger and lesser know titles but overall this cd has an electricity to it that will make you play it over and over again.  Peter Gabriel sounds true to form and the band is obviously at its best.
B0002PZVH0|5.0|In my humble opinion, \\"Music For Airports\\" and \\"On Land\\" represent the heights of Eno's Ambient recordings.  Here, using pianos, synths and beautiful, wordless female vocals plus his usual tape loops and treatments Eno creates a stunning soundscape that manages to stay in the background but still maintain interest, a difficult trick to pull off.  This is not your father's elevator muzak!<br /><br />This CD is absolutely perfect for reading, meditating, studying, deep-thinking, daydreaming or just plain chilling out.  Exactly what Eno was aiming for.  Well done, and a classic of it's kind.<br /><br />Note:  the fourth section is actually well over 9 minutes long, not an even 6 minutes as the back cover inexplicably states.
0553573403|5.0|Suffice to say, from the top marks I'm awarding this book (and the whole series thus far) I found it to be an excellent read. No, that's insufficient, this is not only the best written Fantasy series (by far surpassing Tolkien in my opinion) I've read, it's almost certainly the most enjoyable book of ANY kind.<br /><br />The writing style is intelligent and treats the reader accordingly, which is a refreshing change in the Fantasy genre, and the sheer bloody-mindedness of the plot subverts every preconception the reader may have while maintaining the traditional escapist elements familiar from 'lesser' works. The world of Fire and Ice is so fully realised it's hard to keep track of the history and vast array of characters but Martin guides you through it effortlessly and seems to have known from the first line exactly what is going to happen in every subsequent paragraph. His attention to detail is almost scary. The series also (incredibly) manages to improve with subsequent readings as the reader gets to grips with the innumerable plot developments and realises that the most unexpected of events was probably sign-posted ten chapters back.<br /><br />One note of caution to perspective buyers however is that despite it's Fantasy trappings this is NOT a series suitable for children. Mr Martin does not shy away from explicit descriptions of horrific violence and sex and the language is frequently of the four-letter variety. Equally disturbing is the brilliant realisation of the multitude of characters in these books where the 'Heroes' prove capable of horrendous atrocities and the 'Villains' sometimes act with compassion and honour. And these characters can DIE; If a situation looks likely to be fatal, chances are it will be, which is almost unique in an on-going series and means every violent encounter is almost excrutiatingly tense.<br /><br />So, not for the faint-hearted but certainly a series that sets entirely new standards for fiction, Fantasy or otherwise.<br /><br />Brilliant.
B00003CXA2|4.0|Forrest Gump, is the story of a man who is not that smart, but not \\"stupid\\" either.  He has no agenda, no plans, just a love of life and all that is in it.  He is the modern symbol of innocence, and that is why he became such a symbol after the movie release. <br /> <br />The director traces time from the 50's I'd say all the way to the 70's, with tons of music along the journey.  The film was highly effective, although was often seen more as a comic endeavor.  Too many young people overlooked the overriding tale of innocence in a crazy and sin-filled world. <br /> <br />Forrest, played by Tom Hanks, is contrasted against his life-long love Jenny, played by Robin Wright Penn.  Jenny experiences all of the mood swings of American culture, i.e., hippie culture, drug life, and so on.  However, Forrest, although he is much more face to face with the most gripping of realities, such as Vietnam and presidential assassinations, never strays from his half-minded yet picture perfect view of reality. <br /> <br />I really liked the attempt that this movie made with the story of everlasting innocence and love; however, too many were distracted by Forrest's many guffaws, specifically his speech impediment.  In addition, many believe this to have a great soundtrack, but combining a vast variety of songs that were popular is not original, instead a score could have been extensively used throughout the entire film instead of using clippings of 60's/70's popular hits no matter how much we liked them. <br /> <br />Also, we probably got the message way before the film was over and thus could have skipped parts of the film and been just the same.  Lastly, I did not like the hype, and was sick of all the people quoting the film.  Now, I only saw this film a few days ago, and for many that is shocking; however, this film was not as powerful as people pre-suppose. <br /> <br />Yes, this film was good.  Maybe it will one day be a classic, but right now this is just a quality shrimp in a more-or-less lousy catch.
B00005JNEW|4.0|If you love the movie, then read the book - even if you've already seen the movie.  While the movie does a great job of capturing the hopes, dreams, and adversity of small town Odessa, Texas and the Permian High Panthers, you really get to know the innerworkings of the real people and get to go under their skin and truly feel what they're feeling when you read the book.<br /><br />That being said, the DVD is undoubtedly worth getting - due to both the great movie and it being chock-full of special features and actual interviews with the likes of the real Mike Winchell and Boobie Miles and the actors that played them - as well as the grueling training endured by the cast in preparation for the movie.  Good stuff.
B000002P5W|5.0|In my humble opinion, this record is better than the previous one, the song-writing is better (though 'Purple Haze', 'Hey Joe', 'Foxy Lady', 'The wind cries Mary' 'Third Stone from the sky' and 'Red House' are excellent tracks on 'Are You Experienced'); the song 'Bold as Love' is one of his best ones and the musical peak of the record; 'Little Miss Lover' appears to be an ancestor of the funk-rock played by Prince in the eighties (in the same style there is 'Izabella' - short guitar riffs -); 'One rainy wish' 'Castles made of sand' 'Little wing' and 'Up from the sky' are also excellent, and i like the experimentation of the first track, as the one of 'If six was nine'; excellent record from an excellent musician.
B00006879E|4.0|Of course, everyone loves She Will Be Loved.  I've heard it ad nauseam on the radio and couldn't help but like it.  I still wasn't intent upon purchasing this CD.  Then, everyone from vastly diverse backgrounds began to rave and rave about how they couldn't take this CD out of their car CD player and how incredibly unique this funky, alternative, poppy, yet soulful band really is.  So, I figured what the hey.<br /><br />At first, the CD I thought was immensely overrated.  Upon hearing it the 3rd time and truly listening to the lyrics and getting into the funky, yet hook-laden progressions, I began to see the light.  Now, I can't take it out of my CD player.  Good stuff.
0061015725|2.0|After reading most of Crichton's books, it gets hard not to compare the latest effort against the previous books. With such books as 'Jurassic Park', 'The Andromeda Strain', and 'Disclosure' it makes it difficult to always hit a home run. <br /> <br />This book takes on the dangers of dealing with nano-technology. Crichton is such a good writer that he grab the reader and keep them captivated sometimes in spite of the subject. I think that is a great skill and still enjoyed the book. <br /> <br />The story did lose me a little regarding the mass of nanobots and their life like abilities. It is hard to believe some of the books imagery. This may be partly due to the limited knowledge regarding nano-technology. <br /> <br />If you a Crichton fan or some looking for an enjoyable easy read, then this book is good. However, if you're looking for Crichton's next great novel, I didn't think this book stood up with the rest.
B00005JMYI|1.0|This is worse then a really bad SNL skit. It's a one joke exercise in lame unfunny movie making. If you want to see the 70s lampooned in a funnier, smarter way get the Ben Stiller Starsky and Hutch remake.
B00005O3VC|4.0|I remember first seeing this movie when I was in junior high school and laughing till I cried. There was a small group of us who were Python fans and couldn't get enough of the film. <br /> <br />I do have to admit that the film should have been remastered and cleaned up. The sound is a little fuzzy and the picture quality is ok. However, I can overlook some of those issues once the opening credits start. Make sure you have your popcorn on hand before starting the movie to see all of the opening credits! <br /> <br />I really enjoyed the extras including the trailers, and especially the LEGO version of the 'Knights of the Round Table' song. Visiting the film locations was also a treat. <br /> <br />If you enjoy other Python films and DVD's then this is a must have. If you are unfamiliar with the Monty Python crew, take the time to see a true gem.
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|The movie is great in my opinion but there really isn't anything spectacular about the DVD. Still, the movie transfers great to DVD and if you like the blues you'll like this movie!
B0000508UN|5.0|After his wildly prolific period in the early 60's, Green disappeared from the music scene for several years due to drug problems.  When he re-emerged in the late 60's to early 70's it was with a completely different sound.  Gone were the bop and the blues, in with the soul-jazz/funk.  Green formed a tight, funky group for live appearances, including on this date Blue Note house drummer Idris Muhammad.<br /><br />Recorded with the usual Blue Note perfection at the Cliche Lounge in Newark, NJ on August 15th 1970, this CD will make you feel like you're right there in the audience.  You can actually hear the ice clinking in the drinks and the fans talking and shouting.  Close your eyes and you're right there in a smoky early 70's jazz club listening to a true legend get down with his bad self!  But ever the seasoned showman, Green knows enough to \\"bring the room down\\" for two slower songs, and two highlights of the album they are!<br /><br />\\"Grant Green Alive\\" is far from Green's justly famous earlier works in the more traditional Blue Note style, but if you love soul-jazz/funk like this, it's a masterpiece.  Fans of classic records like \\"Idle Moments\\" and \\"Grantstand\\" might want to consider these reviews before adding this one to your collection, as more traditional jazz fans might not dig it.<br /><br />I do.

B00000JLWW|1.0|I guess if there's a huge audience for \\"daytime dramas\\" and the \\"reality\\" programming that contaminates the airwaves at night, then this piece of dreck was bound to succeed.  It begins with a cheesy romance, nausea-inducing music, let's-get-this-over-with acting, and the wimpiest leading man in the history of Hollywood.  This continues on, seemingly interminably, until the arrival of the long, long overdue iceberg.  \\"Reality\\" programming is based upon the showcasing of the misery of others (who got fired, who got kicked off the island, who ate a quart of grub worms for nothing, who got rejected by the Bachelor); here we get to see (almost) everybody drown (if only the ever creepy-looking Celine Dion had been aboard).  This elegy for the simple-minded, which makes Gone With the Wind look like the Great American Movie, asks only two questions:  Will Leo nail Kate, and Who Won't Drown?  On both counts I can only say \\"Frankly, my dear, who cares?\\"
B00004U45G|4.0|Whether you are a Black Crowes, Led Zep fan, or both, this is a great live cd.  Sounds like they have been playing with Jimmy Page in the band for years.  The selection of songs fuels this release with a live version of \\"Hey Hey What Can I DO\\"....the sound quality of the recording is really good and the energy is ever present.  Shake your own money maker and buy this release, it's worth it!
0060594888|1.0|I have a couple of issues with this book.<br /> First, Canfield is certainly a master at gathering anecdotes to ease the soul or provide inspiration. He has certainly done that here but the stories in The Success Principles can be found in dozens of other books. Many, such as titles by W. Clement Stone or Napoloen Hill, can be found for pennies in used book stores or even here at amazon.com.<br /><br /> Secondly, and this is my biggest concern, is the constant message of acquiring things to \\"make us happy.\\" For instance, I deserve to have a Porsche because a Porsche will make me happy. Therefore, I'll focus all of my energies into getting that car.<br /> As a Christian I am taught to have an attitude of servanthood (I am to die to self and live for Christ). The Success Principles flies in the face of that attitude encouraging the reader to acquire stuff and stature  -- and only then will we achieve \\"prosperity.\\"<br />God certainly wants us to be successful but He wants us to be humble before Him first. The Success Principles instead preaches that we \\"are in control of our own destiny\\" and only when you affirm that can you truly be successful.<br /><br /> There is some good information in this book and some of it is certainly inspiring. I, however, cannot recommend it for the ME, ME, ME message.<br /><br /> Instead, find a copy of Charles Stanley's \\"Success God's Way.\\" Stanley's book provides a balanced approach to life and work.
0385510454|4.0|I always know I'm in for an enjoyable read with a Grisham book and The Broker did not disappoint. Joel Backman is not a hero-type protagonist; he has a spotted past but jail time has shifted his priorities. Mr. Grisham's descriptions of Italy gave me wanderlust, although I could have done with a little less of the detailed language lessons. I've eagerly awaited every new Grisham book for years, ever since I accidentally discovered A Time To Kill long before the bestseller list discovered John Grisham.
B000005H7D|5.0|John Coltrane in his prime couldn't have put out anything bad if he tried. While 1957's Blue Train (the only Coltrane release on Blue Note) isn't as innovative as Giant Steps or A Love Supreme, it's so chock-full of jazz standards and absolutely gorgeous ensemble playing that you'd be a fool to care. The best of his pre-Tyner/Garrison/Jones work, in my opinion. It's in a similar \\"cool\\" vein to Kind Of Blue, but better and more accessible in my opinion--it's less downtempo, and \\"swings\\" more. Of course both are classics, and should be bought in conjunction with each other.<br /><br />The intro of the title track is instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with post-bop jazz; it contains wonderfully melodic, adventurous solos from the master himself, and you'd wish it lasted longer than 10 minutes. Moment's Notice and Locomotion swing like a mofo, with some great work by Lee Morgan and Curtis Fuller on trumpet and trombone, respectively. Lazy Bird and I'm Old Fashioned are sublime ballads--Morgan especially shines on the latter. You can tell the band was actually having fun on this release, playing off each other with the kind of chemistry only a studio full of virtuosos could ever have. And just think: Coltrane was only warming up.<br /><br />This version contains a little video clip of a Coltrane interview that you can view on your PC, and extra takes of the title track and Lazy Bird. The definitive version to own, and essential to those whose jazz horizons extend beyond \\"easy listening.\\"
B000005IU2|5.0|Albums like this aren't made anymore. The Stooges are band that fired out three timeless classics and I think this is the most interesting of the bunch. The passion and drive of the band turns in to a real avant gaurd direction. They are finding themdelfs and building bridges at this point. It rocks 10 times harder then the sex pistols and groves more then the doors! These are some of the best songs in the stooges library. My favorites being \\"Down In The Street\\", \\"Dirt\\", \\"T.V.Eye\\" and \\"1970.\\" Their self titled started it all, and Raw Power is a total classic but Funhouse is the album that will command your attention the most.
B0000009SM|5.0|One Size Fits All is one of Frank's more \\"commercial\\" mid-70s albums along with Apostrophe and Overnight Sensation, and quite possibly my fave Zappa disc. With one of his finest lineups (George Duke on vocals and keys, Chester Thompson on drums, Ruth Underwood on percussion) and Zappa himself in fine form on guitar, this is a great, concise rock/fusion outing.<br /><br />Like most of Zappa's albums, One Size Fits All embraces several styles--jazzy tracks like the nine-minute Inca Roads (a concert standard) and Andy with crazy time signature changes and difficult vocal melodies (most bands couldn't pull this stuff off with weeks of rehearsal; Zappa and his team make it sound easy); rollicking, funky/bluesy rock in the form of San Berdino (my fave), Can't Afford No Shoes, and Pojama People; a weird little piano ditty (Evelyn A Modified Dog); and the beautiful melodic centerpiece of Sofa (two versions, one with German [?!] vocals courtesy of Frank). Just the right combo of quirk, excellent musicianship, and rocking out. And unlike most of Zappa's other albums, there's not a track that feels extraneous or tossed in to fill up space.<br /><br />The guitar solo on Inca Roads is perhaps one of Zappa's best on record, and showcases just how refined his technique was. Instead of flashy 300-note-a-minute outbursts that so many would-be \\"guitar heros\\" favor, he lays into the track with an effortlessly melodic and flowing showcase that makes excellent use of tone control and guitar effects. It was actually taken from a live performance in Finland, but thanks to Frank's careful knob-twiddling in the studio you'd be hard-pressed to tell.<br /><br />This covers just about all of Zappa's bases well, and along with Hot Rats makes the ideal listen for a Zappa virgin. Highly reccommended.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|My brother bought me Napoleon Dynamite for Christmas.  Both he and I were excited because of all the hype and the commercials were hilarious...too bad we didn't know that they showed all the good material in the movie in a one minute movie trailer.  I turned the movie off after thirty minutes because I couldn't find a reason to finish it.  If you get hold of this movie, I suggest you just fastforward to the part where Napoleon is dancing because that is the only thing worthwhile.
0553573403|5.0|After both reading this book and the it's detracting reviews, I was quite surpirsed. The majority of people who gave the book three or more stars seemed to enjoy the pace of the book and it's characters. However, those who strongly disliked the book seemed to have the same arguements (1)Too much gratuitous sex (2)Sex with minors (3) Incest (4) No driving protagonist (5) No clear plot resolution (6) Too Boring<br /><br />While all of these seem valid arguements, they seem to disreguard the very motive of Martin's work. I don't mean to speak for him, but I also feel that those who speak against his work have the wrong idea. For example, if anyone has ever picked up a history book, they would've realized that SEX HAPPENS! It was (and is) a fundemental part of society. During the middle ages it was all the more important because sex meant heirs and laborers. While this seems *ghasp* awful to some people, the truth is that it happened, and at the time the reasons seemed completely plausable. I am in no way excusing this behavior, but I think it is important to note the fact that Martin's world in many ways, mirrors the Medieval world. By the same token I also beleive that this book isn't for kids, and agree with the fact that some of the scenes might be a bit too descriptive. But Martin is a writer, it's his job to describe things to us, it's not his fault because he did a good job.<br /><br />Speaking about lack of a clear protagonist I would say IT'S ABOUT TIME! All those who detract from this book claim that you can't root for either side because each is as bad as the other. Well WELCOME TO REALITY! For once their is no brawny knight on a white steed to save the day. Martin's characters are REAL. They fight for their own gain, for revenge, and for lust of power...*surprise* just like real people!!!<br /><br />And as to those who say it's boring...that may be, but sometimes I like to watch a game of political chess than see two huge armies hack each other to pieces, but hey, that's just me.<br /><br />So to all those who didn't like A Game of Thrones, I understand that not all books are not for everyone, and maybe I'm even caught up in the book's mass populartiy, but I think you should still critique a book based on it's merit as a work on it's own, and not judge it by other means. So, if you want to read a real novel about psuedo-medieval times and political intrigue, then by all means read this book. If not you can read a romance novel, where there is a clear protagonist and you can feel closure when the book ends by the brawny man sweeping the little innocent woman onto a white horse and riding off into the sunset to live happily ever after.es, but hey, that's just me. <br /> <br />So to all those who didn't like A Game of Thrones, I understand that not all books are not for everyone, and maybe I'm even caught up in the book's mass populartiy, but I think you should still critique a book based on it's merit as a work on it's own, and not judge it by other means.

B0002X314C|4.0|Great CD!  the second track \\"Get Lifted\\" is possibly the best song.  CD kinda trails off towards the end, but all in all, it is a CD worth buying, not downloading.  Plus, with Kanye behind the decks, you know its gonna have some good beats.  I would call him a black version of Jamie Cullum (check him out if you like mellow songs with a piano).  But while this CD is very very good, i think the delay may have hurt its success.  \\"Used to Love U\\" was out on the radio a little too long before the CD dropped.
B00005JMFQ|3.0|When I first watched this movie I thought it was just more tripe from the Hollywood movie machine. But, after watching it again, I developed my own theory about film: Some of the relationships presented are truly love and others are something else - infatuation, lust, selfishness, etc. Love is a sincere gift of self - YOU watch this movie and decide - which is love and which is not.
0792151720|5.0|This movie is a great film with lots of well-deserved Academy Awards. For this movie be sure to view a widescreen edition, it is well worth it. Amazon has the widescreen VHS available for as low as 24 cents. This is a movie that most likely you will enjoy seeing again and again. It gets better with age.<br /><br />This movie offers so much to the viewer that it is truly amazing. I will mention some of the high points:<br /><br />1. The magnificence of the ship is well displayed. It is almost breathtaking.<br /><br />2. The lack of repect for the danger of the icebergs is so obvious. It is as if the crew was inviting disaster.<br /><br />3. The love story is very well done and is believable. The charming and sweet love story is a story in itself. The movie is really two movies in one - the story of the Titanic and the love story of Rose and Jack. These two stories work very well together in this case just adding to the drama of the events.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|Not only is The Weezer Blue Album one of the best albums ever recorded, the deluxe edition offers even more to the whole package. The first disc is the blue album it's self. the second disk holds some rare tracks including songs from the kitchen tapes. those songs are Paperface, Lulaby for wayne and more. another great feature about the second disc is that it holds  multiple b Sides. Every B Side on the second disc is fantastic. My personal favorite is Mykel and Carli. I Suggest you buy this CD.

0385335482|5.0|I completly loved this book, from begining to end. My teacher's wife even loves this book and that tells you something. And if you love this book, the series is even better. You see this book has everything I love, shopping (a given), hansom, funny men (that would be Luke), a great plot(well it's a funny one that makes you never want to put it down. And listen up there is no seriousness once so ever), and a great end(that kept me wanting to read it over and over again). I truely recommend this book to any of those romanitc, comidical people out there i.e. me. Ok so hope you enjoyed my review.

It doesn't pretend to be more than it is; a rather gentle poke at the mores and values of a very liberal, trying-hard-to-be-humanitarian Southern California family.<br /><br />Other reviewers have described the plot: Spoiled brat wife Deborah (in a much-too-over-the-top hysterical performance by Tia Leoni) hires Latina housekeeper (the stunningly beautiful and intensely endearing Paz Vega), and tries to show her that she considers her equal to the family. There is much humor and some pathos, but the enjoyment is in the supporting actors. Vega is absolutely marvelous as the proud housekeeper who sees through her employers much more than they know; Sarah Steele, an endearingly awkward teenager, is fabulous as the daughter whose mother lets her know how fat she is. The acting falls down with Adam Sandler, the perfect husband and father who isn't believable for a single minute but who isn't obnoxious about it, and Leoni, who WAY overdoes the neurotic Deborah to the point of fingernails on the blackboard.<br /><br />So why did I like this movie? It is just basically a sweet story, no harm done, nothing horrible, and very enjoyable if you aren't looking for something deeply intellectual. I like it, and would recommend it despite its flaws.
B00005JMAH|3.0|I watched this movie when it came out in the theater, even though I have been disappointed in the previous two movies. The departures from the original story plots are just too great for me to enjoy them completely, and this third installment has shown more changes in the storyline than the others. So, why do I go? The only reason these movies are worth watching is for the excellent characterizations of Harry, Hermione, and Ron. These three actors have the parts down pat, and I applaud their efforts. Richard Harris was a wonderful Dumbledore, and it would have been hard to replace him in any case, but their choice of actors was wrong, at least to me. The image I have of Dumbledore does not fit this new actor. <br />Bottom line: See the movie for the three main characters and try to ignore the gaping absence of the original story.
B00001OH7O|5.0|This is the album where Bowie started to get really, really good.  He reveals himself here throughout each piece as a master composer, a beautiful singer and the consummate artist.<br /><br />The heavy reliance on pianos and string arrangements rather than electric guitars helps give an intensely personal, almost desperately honest feel to *Hunky Dory*.  Whereas *Ziggy Stardust* would erupt as a vast glamrock sort of doomsday symphony, this album is built on a collection of what you might call non-conceptually related \\"chamber-style\\" pieces.  It's almost as if you're hearing forty or so minutes of the real Bowie before the characters of Ziggy, Halloween Jack and The Thin White Duke (to name only a few) hijack his persona and take over.  Which isn't to imply that the later concept albums aren't absolutely incredible, but I find myself for some reason listening to *Hunky Dory* long after I've put most of the others away.  Bowie sings straight from the heart here and establishes a direct connection with his listener, and I can't help but think this sort of intimacy and forthrightness has something to do with *Hunky Dory's* seemingly endless listenability.<br /><br />Songs which would serve as throwaways on other artists' albums (such as \\"Kooks,\\" say, or even \\"Fill Your Heart\\") contain some of the niftiest lines (both musically and textually speaking) in all of rock.  The range of emotions presented here is enormous, from the reckless humor of \\"Andy Warhol\\" to the desperation of \\"Quicksand\\" to the wisdom of \\"Oh! You Pretty Things\\" to the mystical depression of \\"Bewlay Brothers\\" to the perceptiveness and concern of \\"Life on Mars?\\"--you don't ordinarily get this much depth and variety from music, let alone pop music.<br /><br />A great place to start--if not *the* place to start--for those who really want to get going with Bowie.
B000660UN0|5.0|This albums IS NOT a clapton album and it IS NOT a robert johnson album. The road clapton takes to approaching these songs is just like in Me and Mr. Johnson but it is done with more intensity. If u were disappointed with too few guitar solos or too few \\"God-like\\" displays of virtuosity then you are not listening. Thr music doesnt call for a big solo, its not a sideshow its real blues. I highly recommend this album to fans of the blues but it isnt for every clapton fan. Just like in Me and Mr. Johnson the solos are brief if existent.  <br />On the other hand this album is not for all Robert Johnson fans, because u may be disappointed that only one solo acoustic track made it to the CD, but there is a good reason for that. Clapton struggles to make it perfect, which is why it was never on a studio album, he says in the DVD \\"It's been my experience that to play Robert Johnson correctly u need two guitars.\\" <br />if you are looking for outstanding guitar solos on claptons part buy One More Car, One More Rider or 24 nights. But if you are more into claptons electric blues this is definitely a must, but i would also suggest From the Cradle a '94 (i believe) all blues release.  <br />Not to take away from this album excellent work by all the performers. I highly recommend it as long as u know what you are getting. It is very high quality work, and the DVD is amazing. Even if you dont like Robert Johnson that much u may still want this album. But clapton by no means stands alone on this album (as longas u dont count the songs where he um.. plays alone) with the band present they are an amazing supergroup and make some of the finest music in the world, and if this CD doesnt interest u try the crossroads DVD or you can wait for claptons next solo release which will come out this year. <br />I have over 500 claptons songs on my computer and these tracks are definitely stand-outs, perhaps some of the best. <br />Love, <br />Sean
B0002S947K|5.0|This cd surpassed all my expectations.  I had heard \\"Trouble\\" and \\"Jolene\\" on World Cafe on NPR and I decided to buy the album behind the incredible voice.  I was not disappointed at all.  I can put this cd in my car player, in my cd player at work, or in my home stereo while cleaning the house - its great everywhere!
B000001F3C|5.0|This album brings me a lot of good memories as Rockpalast festival 1983. I haven't been paying attention at this overrated U2 2000, because they're an insult to my memories. I remember 4 young men, brave, strong, honest, with nothing but good hopes to chance the system. <br />There's a lot of memorable stuff here, as Seconds, Drowning Man, Surrender, \\"40\\", etc. Of course, Sunday Bloody Sunday and New Year's Day. <br /> <br />Thanks U2 for this album. I hope someday you'll realise how bad you've doing since All That You Can't Leave Behind. It's time to leave behind sunglasses, ego and all that shameful stuff.
6304509154|5.0|In 1982, director Tobe Hooper and producer-director Steven Spielberg brought us the one horror movie we'll never forget. That movie, ladies & gentlemen, is POLTERGEIST.        The Freelings: STEVEN (played by Craig T. Nelson), DIANE (played by JoBeth Williams), DANA (played by Dominique Dunne), ROBBIE (played by Oliver Robbins), and the adorable 5-year-old CAROL ANNE (played by Heather O'Rourke), are living in the most beautiful house in Cuesta Vuerde. For two straight nights, Carol Anne wakes up to the static reception of the Freeling's television set. She seems to be talking to the static channel. Seems as though, Carol Anne is receiving communications from ghosts, located in another dimension, where Carol Anne claims to her parents that, \\"They're here\\". The next morning, the furniture is being moved around by an unseen force. Now, you would think this particular scene is rather hilarious and you have every to think that it is historically funny. But that night, while in the midst of a storm, an old tree, sitting next to the house, horrifyingly comes to life and grabs Robbie, shattering his bedroom window. Steven and Diane run out to the backyard, desperately trying to save their 8-year-old son. What slipped Steven and Diane's minds is that they left Carol Anne in the bedroom alone. Her bedroom closet opens on its own, where an unseen force takes Carol Anne into the closet. Luckily enough, Steven has rescued his son from the horrifying tree, which is taken away by a mild tornado. Steven and Diane rush back inside to check on Carol Anne. They check the whole house, but cannot find Carole Anne anywhere. Robbie stands in his parents' bedroom, relieved and still very frightened until he hears the voice of his little sister. He looks around and finds that her callings are coming from...the television set.        Steven and Diane have decided to get their help from three parapsychologists: DR. LESH (played by Beatrice Straight), MARTY (played by Martin Casella), & RYAN(played by Richard Lawson). That night, Steven and Diane try calling out Carol Anne's name, whilst the three psychologists watch. Diane calls until she hears Carol Anne's pleasant little voice. They realize that Carol Anne is inside the house, but through another dimension. Everything goes well as Carol Anne tries talking to her family, until something evil begins chasing her, causing her to lose contact with her family. Dr. Lesh and her assistants spend the night for more activity. One specific occurrence during the night is when Marty decides to get himself a midnight snack. Grabbing a stake from the fridge, Marty consciously watches the stake move across the counter and begin ripping itself apart. Scaring the hell out of him, Marty runs to the bathroom to wash his face. As he washes his face, the light becomes brighter than the sun, scourging Marty's face, where he then rips the flesh right off his face in a bloody mess. But he comes to realization that he was only hallucinating. Moments later, the cameras are turned on and pointed towards Robbie and Carol Anne's room, where something is seen floating down the stairs. Everyone looks up in fright, as the apparition disappears. They roll back the film and watch what the camera had picked up. They find the spirits of poorly deceased people. Seems as though the Poltergeists are the ghosts of people who are not at rest.         Dr. Lesh has brought in some extra help. The extra help comes from that of TANGINA BARRONS (played by Zelda Rubinstein). She explains to the Steven and Diane about the ghosts they had seen and why they are in need of Carol Anne's existence. The deceased need Carol Anne to help them cross over to the light into Heaven. But Tangina then goes into the evil portion of this whole nightmarish ordeal. There is an evil presence in this dimension with her. This evil being is only a child to Carol Anne, but to the adults, the evil being is The Beast.         Grabbing rope and entering the kids' bedroom,Tangina, Steve, and Diane desperately try to save their little daughter, while Dr. Lesh and Ryan pull on the rope from downstairs. Diane goes in after Carol Anne, where Steven is horrifyingly frightened by what Tangina had spoken of: The Beast. He drops the rope, as Diane and Carol Anne fall through the downstairs ceiling. Diane and Carol Anne have survived and are doing fine, where the family decides that they're packing up their belongings and moving on out of that house.        While Steven works for just a few more hours on the night of their departure, as Dana has dinner with friends, Diane is home with Robbie and Carol Anne. While Diane is taking a bath, Robbie is suddenly pulled under his bed by his horrifyingly toy clown. Diane finishes drying her hair, until she hears Robbie and Carol Anne scream. She tries to rush out to them, but she is pulled up onto the ceiling by an unseen force. Seems as though Tangina only cleared out the good spirits, but had seemed to have accidentally left the evil in the house. She makes it out of her bedroom and reaches the children's bedroom, but the beast appears at the door, throwing Diane down the stairs and out of the house. While in the backyard, screaming for help, Diane slips into their empty swimming pool, where the bodies of the deceased suddenly appear from the ground. The Freeling's house was, indeed, built overtop a cemetery. Steven's boss had moved the headstones, but had left the bodies where they were. Diane escapes the corpse-filled pool and enters the house. She makes to the kids bedroom and saves Robbie and Carol Anne as their closet breaks away and becomes the entrance to Hell. As they rush through the house, trying to get to the front door, more coffins pop up, revealing more dead bodies. Steven arrives and freaks, grabbing his boss and screaming at him for the horrible mistake he made. He meets up with Diane and the kids, as they jump into the car. Just then, Dana pulls up and finds the horrifying mess. Shetakes one look and jumps into the car with her family, while screaming in fear. As they drive off, they house is broken away into the light and all is left is an empty space, where that beautiful house once stood.        Can you survive the most terrifying poltergeists stirred up by Tobe Hooper and Steven Spielberg? The only you can find out is by watching POLTERGEIST. But be careful, it knows what scares you.

B00006ZCFH|3.0|This cd is not one of my favorites. I love Erykah don't get me wrong. She is very different and takes chances with her music. In this case she took one. I only like maybe 2 songs off of the cd. If you want to hear the real Erykah, the writer get \\"ma ma's gun\\".       I only gave her 3 stars cause she has great writing potential.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|There are times when you see a movie or tv show or read a book and you just know - just know - that you've enjoyed an experience that you don't want to end.  You don't want to leave the theater or you rush back to the book store hoping that there are other volumes on the shelf.  And on occasion, a TV show grabs you and makes you look forward to the next show. \\"Firefly\\" is such a tv show. <br /> <br />Fox has been praised for its creativity, its determination to bring different programming to the small screen and quite often, it's ability to see greatness even if the audience takes a little while to come around. Then, there are the times that they act just like the other big networks and pull the plug when the ratings haven't been the best. <br /> <br />Firefly grabbed me and wouldn't let go.  From the haunting theme song to the characters that were so complex and had so much promise, I just knew that once the audience was found, the show would last for several seasons.  Alas, Fox was nearsighted and cancelled what should have been one of the greatest Sci-Fi shows in TV history.  Am I over the top in my praise?  No.  The show had a humanity and a depth that was far better than anything else on the screen.  There were so many future stories to tell and so many ways Serenity and her crew could have travelled the stars. <br /> <br />Buy this DVD set.  Show it to your friends and family.  Within the first few episodes you'll be hooked.  You'll care about each one of the characters and wonder how their stories will evolve.  You'll enjoy the humor and wit along with the twists and turns in the plotlines.  And then, when you put the final disk on your player, you'll feel a little bit sad and angry that nearsighted executives took this wonderful, wonderful drama away from you. <br /> <br />Lastly, this series is one that the whole family can watch and enjoy together.  My retired parents watched the episodes non-stop for three days and can't wait for the movie. <br /> <br />
B000002LEU|5.0|This is both the place to start listening to Joy Division and the place to stay after getting to know the band.  Covering much of the material of their short stint at creating that genre called \\"PostPunk\\" (also known as \\"goth\\" in some circles) this is a true classic through and through.<br /><br />I like this album because it skips the creepy sexuality of \\"Unknown Pleasures\\" while going to the heart of the more energetic songs.  My only complaint is the loss of \\"Day of the Lords\\" on this compilation (\\"lords\\" is an awesome song as is the Christian themed \\"wilderness\\").<br /><br />Once again, this is \\"postpunk\\" that point in time where certain punks took a more atmospheric, introspective direction in their music.  There is certainly a punk motivation driving this, yet there is a creeping, glacial darkness at work in Ian Curtis and his lyrics.  A sense of impending doom surrounds most of their songs.  They have been labeled the first true \\"Goth\\" band.  Though hardcore Bauhaus fans might dispute that.  Regardless, this is a very, very influential late 70's group.  If you get just one Joy Division album, this would be the one to get.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I am an avid Beatles fan and I was just blown away by the concert.     A. The Performances    Great musicians and friends/collaborators of George: Eric Clapton, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty, Billy Preston, Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, etc. do an outstanding job and everyone of them put their heart and soul into the songs of George Harrison and make them come alive.  It is eerie, but when you listen to Clapton singing \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" Paul McCartney singing \\"All Things Must Pass,\\" or Billy Preston singing \\"My Sweet Lord,\\" you could sense the presence of George as they're singing! Their renditions of Harrison's songs were just as masterful as George singing them. Those 3 songs stood out to me.     Some other musical highlights:    1) Ringo Starr's touching rendition of \\"Photograph\\" (the words take on a completely new meaning in this tribute) and \\"Honey Don't.\\"    2) Anoushka Shankar's beautiful sitar playing accompanying Jeff Lynne's rendition of \\"The Inner Light.\\"    3) Joe Brown's tender covers of \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"I'll See You in My Dreams.\\"    4) Dhani Harrison's acknowledgement and thanks to all the musicians playing.     5) Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr playing together for the 1st time live in over 40 years!!! And they seem to be having a good time!     6) Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and their exciting performance of \\"Taxman\\" and spot-on re-endition of \\"I Need You.\\"     7) Billy Preston's enthusiastic singing of \\"My Sweet Lord\\"    8) The funny song \\"Lumberjack\\" by Monty Python which really lightened up the crowd and the occasion.     B. The Editing    I also liked how the DVD focussed its shots mostly on the musicians performing the songs, rather than panning to the audience and then back to the musicians. (This back and forth between the musicians and then the audience is a very annoying feature which plagues the Paul McCartney \\"live\\" DVDs).    C. The Unique Layout of the Discs    This movie is organized in an interesting fashion:    Disc1 features the whole complete concert ( 2 hr 26 min) -- you cannot do any chapter or song selections.    Disc 2 is the theatrical version (2 hr 20 min) -- these are songs from the concert rearranged in order and backstage/ rehearsal scenes/ interviews of the musicians are interspersed within the songs.  You can do scene / chapter selection for Disc 2.      D. Some Reservations    Even though the \\"Lumberjack\\" song was very funny and lightened up the occasion, I didn't care for the song \\"Sit on My Face\\" or the mooning of the audience when the Python members bared their rear-ends to the audience. I felt this dampened the whole respectability and dignity of the whole concert.     Summary:    That aside, I highly recommend this DVD. The performances are outstanding; the picture and sound quality are excellent.   If you're a Beatles fan and a fan of George, you'll love this DVD!  A must-have!  One of the best concert DVDs you can get!
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I admire the courage of Wolfgang Petersen. Making \\"Troy\\" was bound to be controversial. The big question was how much of Homers work do you actually use? Petersen has never shied away from diffcult films, think about Das Boot - in my opinion the best submarine film ever made. Troy was doubtless his greatest challenge.<br /><br />The result was a compromise of sorts. The history of the Trojan war will likely never be fully known. The work of Schliemann is certainly controversial still and no where near universally accepted my modern historians.<br /><br />Petersen, I think did the right thing by keeping the gods directly out of it, other than the characters beliefs and fealties or contempt to or for the gods. Petersen tried to make a historical film based on one version of the history of Troy and probably the most interesting of the interpretations.<br /><br />Like many here I have read and enjoyed the classics of Homer, and have read several translations of both works. Petersen seemed to take some of the most realsitic sounding elements and wove them into an epic film.<br /><br />Casting was inspired and brilliant despite my initial skepticism about Pitt's role as Achilles I was pleasantly suprised at his skill in bringing the character to life.<br /><br />The best in my opinion was Eric Bana's potrayal of Hector. I had always beleived Hector to be the honorable hero that this film brought to the part and from now on I will never again be able to read The Iliad without picturing Bana as Hector. Bravo!<br /><br />As always Peter O'Toole brings class and sophistication to any role and he brought King Priam to life for me. That scene in the tent with Achilles was in my opinion was an Acadamy Award grade performance.<br /><br />I thought Sean Bean played too much the nice guy as Odysseus, but overall I would like to see him in a Wolfgang Petersen version of The Odyssey. Brian Cox nearly stole the show as Agamemnon and performed equally to Pitt's Achilles.<br /><br />The women were all marvelous especially Saffron Burrows as Andromache and Rose Byrne playing Briseis.<br /><br />Writing was excellent and there are way too many excellent lines to mention but one of my favorites was the scene with Agamemnon and Achilles:<br /><br />Agamemnon: A great victory was won today, but that victory  was not yours. Kings do not kneel to Achilles. Kings do not pay homage to Achilles.<br /><br />Achilles: Perhaps the kings were too far behind to see: the soldiers won the battle.<br /><br />Agamemnon: History remembers KINGS, not soldiers! Tomorrow we'll batter down the gates of Troy. I'll build monuments for victory on every island of Greece. I'll carve Agamemnon in the stones.<br /><br />Achilles: Be careful King of kings. First you need the victory.<br /><br />Visual effects were top grade and I was surprised to see how much the crew actually built of the sets. yes they used a lot of CGI but they built a lot and it all looked great especially the horse. If the Trojan Horse actually ever existed I am sure it looked much like the horse built by the film crew.<br /><br />I bought the DVD and plan to watch it many more times.<br /><br />Highly recommended.che and Rose Byrne playing Briseis.

B0006A9FMI|1.0|Excellent animation. Beautiful animation. Animation worth living for. I cannot stress enough how beautiful the scenes are. However... the fact that the subtitles are so big almost completely destroys the animation. add to that the fact that they tell you every little noise is a complete downfall that completely detracts from the massive home theatre system I have built. On a 9 foot wide screen that's almost a foot tall for the text. Furthermore Myself and many other people i know would have been more than happy to buy this AFTER it had an english track and/or had a proper subtitling track.<br /><br />I only hope some Japaneese producers get ahold of this DVD and realize dreamworks is a company that puts nothing into their efforts. (and they missed subtitling quite a few sound effects)
B000002HMH|2.0|Everyone knows the Metallica story to this point.  Through the 80's they were one of the pioneers of thrash metal.  Ride The Lightning, Master Of Puppets, and And Justice For Al are all thrash metal, and heavy metal in general classics.  They simplified things with their self titled album, which produced several top hits, and really propelled them into something else.  They were no longer just a metal band.  They were international superstars, releasing one of the highest selling albums of all time.  There was a delay in recording and releasing this album.  Once it finally came out, we got an album that is more simplistic, more polished, more experimental, and worse lyrics.  I'm honestly not sure what they were going for on here.  This is a mix of hard rock, blues rock, and alternative rock.  Adding to the simplicity of the album it feels like a sell out album, which with the music industry devil Bob Rock, you could expect this.  Still I was expecting to take a huge dump all over this album, but it's really not that terrible.  There are a number of decent songs on here, as well as some truly terrible songs.  I have no idea how Fuel, Unforgiven II, and Where the wild things are, from the follow up b side collection Reload didn't make this album.  James tries some diferent vocal styles on here and they don't really work well.  The guitar work is much more simple, and Lars sounds comatose on the drums.  Ain't My Bitch 6/10 is a fast paced heavier song to start the album.  It's really simple.  The lyrics are awful or I'd give this a fairly solid rating.  The melodies are decent, and the music is passible.  Still a far cry from the opening cuts of the 80's albums.  2X 4 6/10 is a kind of bluesy rocker with a lot of grooves.  Again the lyrics aren't worth the paper they were written on.  The song itself is ok.  It's definitely the first of many experiments on here.  The House Jack Built 6/10 is a little longer than it should be.  Overall I enjoy this one.  There are somesolid melodies.  Overall this song moves from softer and slow to mid tempo and heavier.  Still it drags on a little too long.  Until It Sleeps 6/10 is a definition of sell out if I've ever heard one.  This sounds like an alternative rock song from the 90's.  that's because it is.  This is a mid tempo softer song, with a heavier chorus.  Overall it's not too terrible.  James uses some different vocal styles, and the guitars in the verses really threw me off on the first listen.  this song really showcases the simplicity of their music at this stage, as they have a soft instrumental break, with I guess what you could call a solo, however the song seems to build towards a heavier awesome solo, but instead they just break back into the chorus.  Very disappointing.  King Nothing 7/10 is another groovy mid tempo rocker.  The melodies are pretty decent, much better in the chorus.  Overall this is a pretty nice song, and a good choice for a single.  Hero Of The Day 7/10 starts with a soft guitar riff, which made me wonder if I was listening to Pearl Jam.  Overall though I enjoy this song.  James sings in his softer voice again, but there's also a heavier part in there.    Bleeding Me 7/10 2 soft songs in a row?  This song didn't do much for me to start with.  I like the instrumental break and the heavier parts, but the slower parts didn't do much for me at first, neither did the chorus.  That stuff all grew on me, however the song drags on way too long.  This song should've been 5 or 6 minutes and that's it, and it clocks in at around 8 minutes.  Way too long.  Part of that problem is the softer parts, verses, seem to take forever to get to the point.  Cure 5/10 is a mid tempo groove oriented rocker.  This one's ok, but it's not really special.  Poor Twisted Me 3/10 is a slow paced rocker.  I don't like the vocals at all.  I cringe when James does his \\"Twisted meeeeeeeee\\".  Uh just awful.  Overall this song really goes nowhere, and should've been left off for 1 of those songs from Reload I mentioned.  Fuel would've fit much better there.  Wasting My Hate 8/10 is a simple fast paced rocker.  There's not even a solo in this one, but overall the melodies are pretty solid, and this song gets to the point a lot better than a lot of songs from these 2 albums.  It's very welcome after the snooze fest of the previous few tracks.  Mamma Said -infinity/10 is the worst song Metallica ever did.  They go country on here, and James Hetfield should NEVER sing country again, on an album anyways.  I grew up in a small red neck town.  I HATE country, and even if I didn't, Metallica should not be doing country.  Thorn Within 7/10 starts with a decent heavy riff with a slightly up tempo riff, but then the song goes into a softer slower verse.  The chorus picks up.  Overall this is a decent song.  it has a nice hook.  Ronnie 1/10 is a really slow song.  The pacing is awful.  I just really don't like this one.  The lyrics are atrocious and make the lyrics to Ain't My Bitch seem like poetry.  The song goes nowhere.  I hate the pacing, and the melodies are truly awful.  The Outlaw Torn 1/10 is another song that should've been left off the album.  It's way too long.  It's really slow, and just plods along with no real sense of urgency.    Overall this era did not deserve 2 albums.  But then they'd probably, well with the track listing on here, they did, pick some of the wrong tracks for the album.  They should've put the 3 songs from Reload on here and took off some of the more atrocious songs on here, and the album would be fairly decent.  Overall I was surprised by the number of songs I actually liked on here, but they aren't generally good enough to make up for the really bad ones.  If you love everything Metallica then feel free to get this, but if you only want the thrash stuff, then stay away.  This was certainly a misstep, but not as much as a b side collection of songs from these sessions posing as a new album, a gargled mess called St. Anger, suing everyone in sight, doing a bad symphony album, that crappy Mission Impossible song, and horrible production on Death Magnetic.  This was the second in a series of huge missteps that turned Metallica from a force to be reckoned with in the metal world into a joke.  It's amazing how the mighty have fallen.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Its definately a great movie. It does indeed have a plot; similar to Minority Report, it uses Matrix effects and styles. The plot is the classic, a \\"perfect system\\" with a character to Uphold the laws of the \\"perfect system\\", until some kind of event or a cause that changes the views of the main character; effect comes into play with the main character, going almost or completely against the \\"perfect system\\" and completely transforms the main characters goals/objectives.
B00006WKY9|4.0|And, frankly, that song is why I bought it.  That the rest of the album is solid 70's metal is icing on the cake.  \\"Sails\\" is, quite simply, one of early metal's crowning achievements, especially for Uli Roth's disciplined yet mind-blowing guitar solo during the intro.  Blackmore has NOTHING on this guy.  Further, it's rhythm track is surprisingly funky, if you can buy that without hearing it.  Trust me. <br /> <br />With the exception of a few tracks on \\"Blackout,\\" I'm not much of a Scorps fan, but this album is really great, in its idiom.  And, seriously, if you want to hear some of the finest hard rock guitar playing ever, pick up this bad boy. <br /> <br />You best believe!
B0000524CY|4.0|The Exorcist is a movie that has drawn my curiosity ever since I was a kid.  I think the very fact that it was deemed unsuitable for my age, only served to strengthen my resolve to watch it. When I did eventually watch it, I found the movie to be interesting, a bit annoying, and yes a bit frightening.    The basic plot of \\"The Exorcist\\" is a young girl named Regan is possessed by the devil shortly after playing with an Ouija board. Everyone is at first skeptical of her possession and they simply assume that Regan has a mental disorder. Only until later there is an acceptance that only an exorcism from an experienced and faithful priest can save Regan.    The interesting things that I found in the movie were Max von Sydow's acting and the use of sound in the movie.  I found it interesting how von Sydow plays the exorcist Fr. Merrin, when only eight years before he played Jesus Christ in \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\".  I must admit I think Max von Sydow's performance in both movies was remarkable. I guess that is not surprising considering that he is perhaps the best actor to come out of Sweden.  A simple restored scene from \\"The Exorcist\\" that I think demonstrates Von Sydow's film presence is when he (as Fr. Merrin) says \\"What a lovely name\\" in response to finding out Regan's middle name. That phrase alone gives hope and demonstrates his love and concern for the unfortunate Regan. It is Max's unique voice and acting that gives presence and credibility to his role as a priest and exorcist.  It is this very point, which brings me to the most annoying parts of the movie. The character of Fr. Karras (the younger priest) annoys me because he is really ignorant.  But in all fairness, I guess it is his dislikeable ignorant character, which serves to make Fr. Merrin all the more likeable and credible. Fr. Merrin in fact, puts Fr. Karras in his place when he says, \\"There is only one person\\" (in response to Fr. Karras believing that Regan has multiple personalities).  It is an obvious sign that psychology has no place in these particular matters of faith.    The other annoying character is the mother of Regan, Chris MacNeil. She states that she has no religious beliefs and yet she continually uses the Lord's name in vain.  Chris's sudden temper tantrums and tone of voice are not all that appealing either.    The updated version of \\"The Exorcist\\" includes longer scenes with the detective William Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) as well as some frightening new additions, which include several imposed images of the demon Pazuzu throughout various dark scenes of the movie. However most interesting restored footage is the infamous \\"spider-walk\\" scene. The spider-walk\\" scene is disturbing not only because it is unexpected but also because it is unnatural in its speed and movements. It is a brilliant scene because it delivers the message to the viewer that anything associated with the devil is unnatural.    What makes \\"The Exorcist\\" scary? I believe the movie's power to frighten can be attributed to 2 factors.  The first is that the viewers know that the frightening aspects of the movie can apply to them when they are most susceptible, in the middle of the night in their bedroom!  The second and most important factor is that most viewers not only know that demonic possession has happened before, but that it can happen again!    If you want to read some real-life cases of demonic possession, I suggest you read \\"Hostage to the Devil\\" by Malachi Martin or \\"Begone Satan\\" by Carl Vogl.
B00005OAA6|5.0|So, Victoria finally scores her own solo, and the outcome was great! I always thought that I never heard her voice during any of the Spice Girls songs and she only sings when the girls are all singing together, and back then, I thought that she really wanted to shine, but didn't get a chance...and that she probably wasn't as much of a good singer as the other girls...how wrong was I? She totally knows how to sing, and her smash hit, \\"Not Such an Innocent Girl\\" stuck in my head for a long while. Too bad I don't get to buy this CD since I am in U.S., but if I get any chance of going to Europe, I am so getting it...I don't care if I have to spend a thousand dollars airline ticket just to buy a CD!
1567184855|5.0|Dr. Newton has practically stumbled onto the door to the other side, but then serendipity is the reason for a lot of great discoveries, isn't it? I believe his research will help humans evolve to a higher level. A friend gave me \\"Journey of Souls\\" to read after my dad passed away and it put my mind at ease. My mom, who is 82, reads his books over and over as much as she reads her bible. Funny combination but then again, maybe not. It all depends on how you interpret it.
0312263120|2.0|After reading Dan Browns other books (The Da Vinci Code, Angels & Demons, and  Deception Point) I was looking forward to reading his first novel Digital Fortress. This was not his best work. Unlike some authors who start off strong and end up pumping out glorified movie treatments Dan Brown started off slow and has gotten better as he has developed as an author. This book just missed the fast paced action and well defined characters of his later books. It will make a better movie then it does a book. There a little to much X-files conspiracy theory here. The big huge super secret code breaking computer is the linch pin in the story. The situation that puts the computer in \\"danger\\" is just a little unbelievable to be credible. The main characters also just don't seem to be as developed as they could be. While the code breaking in The Da Vinci Code, Angels & Demons was fun and really quite thrilling here is was just to... cerebral... not enjoyable. All in all I think this will make a pretty good movie ... maybe a movie of the week.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I am 52 years old. This movie was requested by my 20ish kids on vacation recently. We rented it, watched it several times, then bought it. I think nearly the entire movie is hilarious. My wife thinks it's stupid. The kids, of course, love it. It is certainly complete deadpan humor, as everyone seems to agree. I think this movie is a great example of how it does not take a big film budget to make a clever very funny movie. I won't wreck the movie for you, but I can't imagine anybody keeping a straight face during the class president skits near the end. Just the thought of that scene has been cracking me up for weeks. There is nothing dirty or offensive in this movie that I can think of. It is not low-brow Farrelly (sp?) Brothers stuff at all. I think this is right up there with a very few movies I own that I can watch over and over and still laugh.
0671027387|5.0|Now this book was FUN!<br /><br />Deception Point is the sophomore book from Dan Brown. This book is worlds better then his first book Digital Fortress. It has everything you want in a political thriller with a little science fiction thrown in. There's sex (not to much enough to make it titillating), greed, political, power grabbing, and a nice little touch of family discord. The main characters are well developed and will be easy to cast for the movie (this one BEGS to be made into a movie!). I will not bore y'all with my casting (I've tried to be good and not color my reviews with how I cast then while I ready them.). The good are good and the bad are very very bad. It's a fun read that you will not want to put down until the last twist is turned!<br /><br />THIS IS A MUST READ

068485743X|4.0|The concept behind Noah Lukeman's \\"The First Five Pages: A Writer's Guide to Staying Out of the Rejection Pile\\" is that editors can reject most manuscripts within minutes (or even seconds) based on a few simple criteria. He uses these criteria as a guide to show you how you can spot the flaws in your own work and then go on to solve them.<br /><br />The great thing is that this isn't just a guide to fixing surface flaws and using gimmicks to try to \\"sneak\\" your work past editors, which is what it sort of sounded like when I first heard of the book. Instead it uses those simple criteria as a way of organizing major, real issues. It delves into the idea that there's a very good reason why editors can dismiss most manuscripts out of hand--these criteria are used to note real problems that plague manuscripts and make them not worth the editor's time. Because of this, by going through the criteria and showing you how to apply these criteria in judging and repairing your own work, Lukeman is telling you how to make your manuscript better.<br /><br />Lukeman approaches things in the order that he, as an editor, tends to look at and dismiss them by, suggesting that you do the exercises from the end of each section and chapter on your manuscript before proceeding to the next part. This means that with each successive pass through your manuscript, it should (in theory) last just a little longer through an editor's evaluation.<br /><br />In each part Lukeman goes into a typical problem that will cause a manuscript to get quickly rejected by editors. He explains why it's a problem and how to fix it, gives examples, and then provides exercises to use on your own manuscript.<br /><br />I can't agree with all of his suggestions, and this book makes for somewhat dry reading, but it's a great checklist to apply to your manuscript.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|This is very good music. A lot of people are saying that jet is unoriginal. This isn't true. I got this CD not knowing what to expect. I do think that \\"Are you gunna be my girl\\" is over played, but \\"Roll over DJ\\" is original and very good. I am a big fan of the slow style of music that they play, the music that is not played on the radio. \\"Look what you've done\\" is the best song i've heard this year. \\"Lazy gun\\" is also very good. It is a CD you will not get sick of. I have listened to this CD many, many times. VERY GOOD BUY IY!

B00006RU5B|3.0|Rage Against The Machine and Soundgardens music sounded much better than this.  <br /> <br />The thing is, those two bands actually sounded real,  <br />but this album is way to polished sounding, with squeaky clean guitar effects from Tom Morrelo, and it is also quite mainstream, which if you have any musical sense - is very very bad. <br /> <br />What would of made this album better. <br />Raw, and a more real sounding production to their music that would of turned off mainstream music audiences and made them a real sounding band - as good as Sound Garden and Rage Agains the machine. <br /> <br />Tom Morrelo should of had his Guitar turned up with some proper real distortion and Chris Cornell could of sounded less like a roaring and droning dragon. <br /> <br />Heres hoping the next one will be better.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Collatoral has a great cast, a great plot, and is a joy to watch. It's what a thriller should be, and Cruise is better than his usual self. The one and only down point is the ending, which is unclimatic.

B000750OEA|5.0|From her very first 1987 video \\"Locomotion\\" to the current UK smash video \\"I believe in you\\", this new DVD is a stunning visualisation of her amazing career.  It does miss some of her earlier hits such as \\"What kind of fool\\", \\"Word is Out\\" and \\"some kind of Bliss\\" but this could be due to disc space. <br /> <br />Kylie has forged an impressive career in both Australia and UK, and to an extent in the US (with the single/video \\"Cant Get You Out of My Head)\\".  It should be noted that the video for this is edited on the DVD, not sure why they did that. <br /> <br />Overall, the DVD is a great place to start for those wanting a Kylie DVD in their collection.  It also includes the awesome video for \\"Slow\\".
B00006LI4S|5.0|This is incredible.. I can't believe that anyone gave it anything less than 5 stars.  The musicality is second to none.  Truly outstanding for Pink Floyd fans and non fans alike.  Wish You Were Here and Comfortably Numb sound amazing with the acoustic vibe.  Dimming of the Day is really a beautiful song, and High Hopes gives me goosebumps.  The people who say he is past his prime, or lacking in guitar skills are nuts.  Yeah, he's older, that's what happens to people.. we are all going to have to deal with it eventually, no matter how much we fight it.
B00003CX9Q|4.0|The USA 2-disc edition of E.T is now the only available DVD anywhere in the world. Universal discontinued the UK and Australian DVD releases some time ago to reflect the limited edition, and while this was to be the case in America too, it is obvious that it is still available there.  <br /> <br />Nevertheless, the USA edition was always the only one worth buying because it included the 1982 release. The Australian and UK releases are PAL formatted which doesn't allow as much disc space as NTSC. Distributors in these regions therefore decided that consumers would prefer the full length special features over inclusion of the 1982 version. A pity because the 1982 version is much better, and how most of us remember it. I think Universal short-changed it's international clients. <br /> <br />Many reviewers have slammed the 2002 version because of the CGI tampering of E.T's character. I have to agree with them, the CGI has caused E.T to look too comical in scenes and quite unrealistic. I can't comprehend how Spielberg considers these alterations an improvement and more aligned to his vision. However, if you own the USA DVD, it doesn't matter because you can simply choose the better 1982 version. In my opinion, movies shouldn't be enhanced unless it is to improve their picture quality (ie. to remove grain, dust etc).  <br /> <br />Overall, a movie worth owning (providing you have the USA DVD).
B0002S947K|5.0|As the previous reviews have indicated, Ray's album is amazing.  I surely would affirm this.  Adding to it, though, I recently saw Ray in concert at Philly, and he was absolutely incredible.  His voice carried with a power far greater than on the album.  Every song flowed through you like it was your own emotions crying out.  It was just him on guitar and an upright bass player for some of the songs.  But I was just amazed at how good he was live...surely more powerful than on the album.  If you have the chance to see him live you must go!
B0002VKZL6|3.0|I have enjoyed Mark Knopfler's music for years and always look forward to a new release.  This release is enjoyable, but it is the same old stuff.  Mark's voice is always a class act and the musicians top of the line. I would love to hear Mark venture off<br /><br />in another direction.  \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\" had the right idea, by having guest vocalists appear. Van Morrison and James Taylor added that little touch to keep the disc interesting.<br /><br />\\"Shangri La\\" is a disc that I reccomend, but don't plan to be blown away by it.<br /><br />RickeG
B0006399FS|1.0|As a fan of U2, I must say that this is by far their worst album. Each of the 11 songs sound exactly the same, and with a combination of twangy guitars, overrated lyrics, and depreciating vocals, this higly praised cd deserved anything but praised. [...]
B000002MP2|5.0|I am by no means a punk connoisseur.  I do no what I like, however, in the punk mode, that raw, screw-you attitude combined with simple ( as in not overly ornate and complicated) power music.  I first listened to this album about ten years ago, and I was hooked immediately.  I love Green Day.  I love the lyrics, which I find witty, ironic, and intelligent as well as being raw.  I could say more, but what else need I say but that this is truly a great CD?  After all these years, it still sounds great to me.
0739420712|4.0|If you've ever heard the phrase \\"skipping Christmas,\\" you probably think that whoever said it was crazy. That is exactly how people reacted when the Kranks decided to simply skip Christmas. How can you skip Christmas you ask? The Kranks just didn't buy all the gifts, food, or put Frosty on the roof. Instead they decided to go on a diet and a get a tan. Until they received a phone call from a very unexpected guest, then things really started to heat up. John Grisham was pure genius to write such an absurd idea as he did in Skipping Christmas.<br /><br />  I personally thought the story was a little dull and crazy, but funny toward the end. I'd give it four stars, because getting into it was a little hard and not written for my age group. All adults should read it. It gives you a different perspective on why we celebrate the holidays and put others first. I would say it shows one thing not to do during the holiday season, because it causes too much confusion on everyone's part. Try it and see if you like it, and if you don't you can tell others why it's trouble to simply skip Christmas.

After leaving the Yardbirds, he played with \\"John Mayall's Bluesbreakers\\", Then \\"Cream\\", then \\"Blind Faith\\". During these periods, he did little singing & was shy about his stardom. After Delaney & Bonnie, he formed another group with those musicians called \\"Derek & The Dominos\\". Duane Allman, a legendary slide guitarist from The Allman Brothers, heard Clapton was recording this album &, after a concert, rode his motorcycle from Sisco to L.A., in the rain & STONED ON HEROIN!! \\"I don't know how I made  it alive\\", he later said. Well, he was sitting in a chair with other admirers when Clapton spotted him. \\"You're Duane Allman\\", he said. Allman replied, \\"I didn't know you knew I existed!\\" Clapton said, \\"Are you kidding? Get up here! I want you on my album!!\\" This took the \\"Layla\\" album to another level of legend!! After, a tour, Allman died, & the Dominos split up. The breakup was attributed to \\"The same paranoia & tension that made us great\\" Clapton added, \\"The Dominos ended too soon!\\" Before they did, they left us this legendary masterpiece! By now, everyone knows this classic version of \\"Layla\\". Most fans probably also \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\", which is one of the greatest songs Clapton ever recorded! The band also did a beautiful version of Jimi Hendrix's \\"Little Wing\\". And, the dominos' recording of Bessie Smith's \\"Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out\\". The entire album is accented by Duane Allman's beautiful slide guitar, which ALMOST drowns out Clapton's work & steals the show! (THAT'S SAYING ALOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) If you're an Eric Clapton fan, BUY THIS! If you're a Duane Allman fan, BUY THIS! If you want to hear some great blues & kicking rock, BUY THIS! If not, BUY THIS! I PROMISE, NOONE WILL REGRET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0446310786|5.0|The book To Kill a Mocking Bird is a classic form the hand of Harper Lee. This book is a timeless classic back from the 1950's. This is a great growing up story about two children and their adventures. These little challenges that they are faced with become even harder when there are no grown ups around except their African American maid. Around dinner time their father Atticus Finch will arrive. Atticus portrayed as a kind sensitive lawyer who is very good with kids, but to the main characters he is an old man who has no exciting hobbies except reading. Scout Finch, Jem Finch and their friend Dill are three young children around the ages of ten and twelve years old who really love to be outside and love to play games. By far their most favorite game is to try and get a creepy old man, Boo Radley come out of his house. These games last a long while and they lead up to the hearing of a black man who is accused of raping a white woman. Back during the 1950's that was a serous offence. There is a trial and Atticus is the man's defense attorney. And everyone thinks he is guilty except the Finch family.

B0002W2KRM|5.0|I purchased this CD from amazon.co.uk (it's about $10 cheaper to import it yourself) in order to get \\"Fast Cars\\", track # 12 that for some reason they decided not to put on the US release.  I'm really not quite sure why this album has gotten such mixed reviews.  I've never seen so many critics give something 5 stars and then trash it in their written review.  But I have ignored them, as usual, and just bought it only having heard \\"Vertigo\\" on the radio.  It's got a little of everything -- \\"Vertigo\\", \\"All Because of You\\", and \\"Fast Cars\\" are fast and catchy while \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own\\" and \\"A Man and a Woman\\" leave me thoughtful.  It's everything I love about U2.  It's a little different and that's fine by me.  As long as it's good, they can play what they like and I'll love it.  And I can't imagaine something not good coming from U2.
B000006V31|5.0|As anyone can tell from the five stars, I love the Leaf Hound record dearly; it's one of theeee very best Brit blues-based rock 'n roll records there ever was (right in there with The Groundhogs, probably). That said, I don't know how anyone can reasonably be so disrespectful as to compare ANY 30-something-year-old record to... The Black Crowes (who everybody knows owe everything to Goats Head-era Stones anyway; but I digress...). Chronology backwards. And although there's clearly the blues thing very strongly here, it's far more Anglo-fied than any old Led Zep. And lo, I was saying to my friend just earlier tonight that I absolutely  HATE Led Zeppelin and always have done- not only because of unpleasant jocky associations but because of their flagrant \\"borrowing\\" of many a blues song. Not so Leaf Hound, who it says here (in the liner notes natch) got their name- and all of the song titles- from a collection of short horror stories by someone named Herbert Van Thal. At any rate, definitely a classic record with a unique kind of occulty vibe all its own (and a helluva little title track too, by the way). A bargain at twice the price too, as the vinyl is supposedly worth something like $2000 (yes, with THREE zeroes). If you're into the early '70s Brit blooze, give this obscure little band a try. So obscure, in fact, that apparently no pictures of Leaf Hound even exist. Hmmm, now that's odd...

None of those are done exceptionally well, but they are there. Character development was pretty weak. I hate saying this about Dan Brown's books, because I enjoyed 'Deception Point' and 'Angels & Demons', but to any Dan Brown fan who knows a little about computers, don't read this.<br /><br />The only reason this got 2 stars is because this was the author's first book. 2 stars for guts, I guess. :o)
1400032717|4.0|The look inside the mind of an autistic teenager and how he reacts to the world around him as well as a realistic approach to the ways others react to that character makes for a fascinating and fun read.<br /><br />I read this while on vacation and highly recommend it as something you can easily escape for a few hours.  Excellent for reading while traveling.
0345298349|5.0|Most mystery writers today produce books that are like cotton candy:  they're light, fluffy, give you a quick sugar high, and are ultimately unsatisfying in the long run.  Unfortunately, most of these writers produce a book a year-whether they have anything new to say or not.  Once in a great while, a mystery writer comes along whose work is so broad in scope as to resemble great literature.  Martin Cruz Smith belongs to this elite group, and Gorky Park is one of the best mysteries ever written.<br /><br />Arkady Renko is Chief Investigator of Homicide for the city of Moscow before the fall of communism.  While he has a 100% success rate in investigating homicides, his personal life is less than stellar.  Renko is called in when three faceless, fingerless bodies are discovered in the snow at Gorky Park during a spring thaw.  He is able to take what little evidence there is, and starts putting together the pieces of this complicated puzzle.  The closer he gets to the truth, the more evident it is that someone (maybe the KGB or even someone in his own office) does not want him to solve this crime.<br /><br />But what makes Gorky Park so fascinating is the Russian angle.  Solving crimes and investigative techniques are a bit different than in the United States (they tend to use a lot of vodka, for one thing).  Not only does Arkady have the party bureaucracy to contend with, but the KGB is also looking over his shoulder.  It is often hard to tell who are the bad guys.  We also get a glimpse of what it was like to live in Soviet Russia.  Professionals like Renko didn't get very high salaries, and living conditions were often spartan.<br /><br />But where Cruz Smith really excels is in his characters. Renko is probably one of the most memorable characters in any mystery.  He is a very likable, sympathetic man with a kind heart.  His humble, self-deprecating manner belies a brilliant mind, which he needs to fight not just criminals, but also the Soviet system.  But Renko also carries a lot of baggage, and it sometimes interferes with his job.<br /><br />Cruz Smith's plot will keep you up nights, reading to find out what happens. Gorky Park is also filled with ironic wit.  Renko never tries to take himself too seriously, and we learn that humor is the best way to survive in the Soviet Union.  When one character tells Renko that he wants to kill him, Renko responds \\"this is Russia.  Get in line.\\"  The exchange between Renko and an FBI agent about defection will have you in stitches.<br /><br />If Gorky Park isn't the best mystery written today, it's certainly close to the top of the list.Renko also carries a lot of baggage, and it sometimes interferes with his job.   <br /> <br />Cruz Smith's plot will keep you up nights, reading to find out what happens.

B0002EXH4K|4.0|quite frankly, metallica can change their musical style and still sound pretty good, dont know why, probly cuz james hetfields voice is about 100 times better than dave mustaines. this is why megadeth should have stayed a thrash band, because the driving beats, thunderous bass and speeding guitars overshadowed mustaines mediocre voice. not to say mustaines lyrics and stuff suck, just that he doesnt have the best voice. esp on \\"sweating bullets\\". but anyway thats my only real beef with this album. this doesnt compare at all with RIP or PSBWB, but it gets the job done. i havent picked up TSHF yet, i probly will soon.
076790592X|3.0|I have conflicting thoughts about this book. On one hand, although it does give the all too cliche life lessons from the earnest voice of Morrie, it is one that you respect and hopefully reaffirm in your life (whatever you may think about Morrie, whether good or bad). After all, some light soul reading is never harmful to anyone. <br /> <br />However, there are a few things that irritate me. For one, Mitch Albom, is sometimes simply unbearable. As Mitch has Tuesdays with Morrie, it is like watching a conversation with a albeit eccentric but venerable professor and a stereotypically superficial football player who has no brains to actually think (in the philosophical and broad sense) about some things in life. Not to mention, although simplicity was probably the point, the writing is sub-par. <br /> <br />In addition, future readers should be warned for extremely sappy material. In some ways, Morrie's completely open affection almost makes the book seem... ... insincere. It was basically a recant of how much they all love each other, which isn't bad, but there are always different ways of illustrating the same emotions if you understand what I mean.  <br /> <br />The book in general seems almost as an overzealous effort to show Morrie and Mitch's new found enlightenment, which in turn unfortunately makes it seem too saccharine or sickly and accordingly, sometimes even fake or insincere.  <br /> <br />Thankfully, it is a quick read, and there are some parts which does make you laugh (maybe even cry) and nod your head in agreement. Overall, you do appreciate Morrie and it does mostly give you a warm fluffy feeling inside... unfortunately, with lingering doubts. Recommended, but not highly, for easy reading.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|<br /> <br />   I, could be like others and start this off on saying how I,  <br />think about The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions but im not going <br />to because they as much deserve to be in this epic saga as The <br />Matrix does, that being said for the many fans and for the many <br />people who went to The Matrix the one film that changed the way <br />movies and philosiphy for films were looked on forever or even  <br />if you just saw the sequels, this is a must have for anyone who  <br />is intrested in The Matrix.It comes with 10 disks the biggest  <br />collection of disks for a dvd set ever.The Washowski brothers  <br />give commentarys on all three films, and for those of you who  <br />couldn't stand the other two films will love the commentarys  <br />on Reloaded and Revolutions the Washowski's were brave enough  <br />to put in commentarys that blast the two sequels while giving  <br />praise to the first film. <br /> <br /> <br />   Those who do not have Enter The Matrix will love on the extras disks the option of seeing the scenes in the game that  <br />were for and explain some things that the films did not.The  <br />anime fans will have a treat with The Animatrix the only  <br />computer animated film on the disk The Final Flight Of The  <br />Osirius is just another reson why this collection is worth  <br />the extra dollars to pay for it.Thousands of conceptual  <br />sketches and tv spots and The Matrix Revisited and Revolutions <br />revisted and Reloaded Revisited are also here where you will  <br />see anything you wanted to know about The Matrix saga in total <br />you couldnt count how many hours of features are here.But if  <br />there is enough for even the hard core fans then even the fans <br />of the movies will find something here , they are vast and  <br />aplenty as the machine world that is depicted in this saga. <br />And just think Star Wars only had 4 disks this one has 10 <br />on DVD The Matrix Ulitimate Collection reigns supreme it starts <br />where the films end while all others stop it is a definate must  <br />have for fans and movie collectors. <br />
B0002V7ODI|5.0|The Director's Cut is only for those who liked Hellboy, but didn't really love it. The Director's cut is magnificent. You truly begin to understand the movie. All the underlying, implied scenes are masterfully expanded upon. You truly get to see what a genius Guillermo is.<br /><br />In my opinion, I think he purposefully made the original Hellboy bland and 2 dimensional, because this one made the characters more 3 dimensional. If you thought the characters already had real emotions behind the larger than life prowess, than you'll think that you almost know them and what they are doing.<br /><br />There is finally a true sense of place, because every scene is easily illustrated with the location name. You understand the mythology behind everything, as the entire story is compounded with facts such as more behind Sammael, a little more on Kroenen, and also a very interesting scene of Rasputin getting a haircut. If you weren't very attentive, then this scene will immediately let you know that you're not watching the same movie.<br /><br />The movie is allowed a sense of kind freedom, as the moments of levity and freedom are enhanced, which in hand make the moments of sadness and strife that much more compelling. All i know is that i'm only halfway through the movie and i'm already writing this review. I don't care if he added a ton more after the point I am at, I just know that right now, this director's cut is amazing.
B000002KOO|5.0|I believe this was Fleetwood Mac's last outing with Peter Green.  If for \\"Oh Well\\" alone you should own this album.  I can't vouch for its transition from vinyl to CD, but this is the blues powerhouse that was Fleetwood Mac.  Peter Green, who along with Eric Clapton, John McVie, and Mick Taylor was a John Mayall alumunus is one of the guitar greats and deserves to be ranked right along with Eric Clapton.  While Green is acknowledged, he really is almost forgotten.  THEN PLAY ON will give you a taste of his great talent.
B000002UE2|3.0|...But not a great record. Grand Funk's second live offering, many years after the legendary \\"Live Album\\", was recorded much better than the first, but that's where the improvement over the original stops. Still a good live set, but lacks the raw magic and energy of it's predecessor. This was Grand Funk after they got a taste of what it was like to be Top 40 Radio superstars. The slick production only made a great live act sound bloated and full of themselves. This was the cat that got fat. The end of the Vietnam war put an end to Mark Farner the protest songwriter. His later work seems tepid at best. But here Don Brewer comes into his own. The addition of Craig Frost to the line-up, although a great musician, only served to help turn a once powerful live band into just another arena pop act. The hunger, anger and power was gone, and it showed. It's funny what fame and fortune can do to talent such as this. What once was raw, powerful and simple, became lazy, radio-friendly, and over-produced. One only needs to listen to the title track of the studio album \\"All the girls in the World, Beware\\" to know when this band hit it's stride. I'm a HUGE Grand Funk Fan...but I have to be honest. This was not what I like to remember about the band who was the first to break the Beatles attendance record at Shea Stadium. Like I said, it's still a good live record...but It's not the Grand Funk that drew huge crowds and gave the fans what they came for, and gave the radio programmers and rock critics the middle finger. It's just another live record, like so many others of the period. Good, but nothing special. And it pains me to say that.

B00064MW6A|4.0|I am not sure what all of the critics were wanting with this movie - it's a comic book for goodness sakes. This was thoroughly fun and rather well done, and I could think of worse ways to spend a rainy afternoon.  Certainly not the epic Oscar contender for the season, but it's a fine piece of engaging eye-candy nonetheless. Worth the rental - and the camp!
B0002DB52M|4.0|First off, there was a documentary called \\"Dogville Confessions\\" that was supposed to be with the DVD? The DVD I had only had the one disc.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for the big-budget movies Nicole is usually in, look elsewhere.. this is the type of movie that winds up on Sundance Channel and IFC, and as far as I know, only played the art houses...  <br /> <br />The draw to this film is Nicole Kidman, but the overall cast is top-rate, legends and current actors alike.  <br />  <br />The entire film is presented in a play format, on a stage, over a 3 hour period, with 7 chapters and a narrator.  <br /> <br />In a way, it reminded me of old clips I've seen of \\"GE Theater\\" or \\"Hallmark\\" teleplays from the 1950s, when they used to televise plays on soundstages.  <br /> <br />To summarize, a mysterious girl named Grace (definitely representative of her nature) runs into small town hiding from something, a town of 20-something people in the 30s. The people seem friendly and Grace tries to point out the positives, but the Dog \\"bears its teeth\\" soon enough and Grace is attacked by the town in different ways. (Bjork had mentioned that von Trier's a \\"stealer of women's souls\\" when they made \\"Dancer in the Dark\\") <br /> <br />Eventually we find out what Grace was running from and there's no mistaking why James Caan is in it.   <br />   <br />It ends somewhat shocking.   <br /> <br />If I was to describe it, it is part \\"Ironweed\\", part \\"Our Town\\" part \\"Threepenny Opera\\" (without the singing) part \\"The Lottery\\".   <br /> <br />I wouldn't say the tone was \\"anti-American\\" though. \\"anti-arrogance\\" maybe... I think von Trier in calling the trilogy \\"America-Land of Opportunity\\" might give some hints into what he's actually trying to say through the films.  <br /> <br />I had thought of a film called \\"Maria Full of Grace\\" which in a way could be a \\"Dogville\\" of sorts, in Columbia.  <br /> <br />Any country could have their own \\"Dogville\\", and putting it in the Depression era ata time when things were truly bleak for many people. The closing credits with the photos past and present show that Dogville still exists for many people in different places.  <br /> <br />I wouldn't have seen this in the theater but for home video it's fine, and I could see watching this a second time to make it worth purchasing.  <br /> <br />
6304493681|1.0|I watched this movie and didn't much like it. Based on the reviews here, I watched it again. I'm Japanese and proud of it, but I've got to say this is just not a good movie. It's not as good as the Matrix (sci fi); nor is it as good as Shrek (animation). It is for anime geeks, which until I saw this movie, I thought I might be one. But for you anime geeks, can you honestly tell us this movie -- which most claim to be the standard in anime -- has better animation than the Incredibles? better effects than Spiderman 2? better story line than Terminator? Not even close. With all due respect to the work put into this film, the animation is reminiscent of the Speed Racer cartoon, and it makes the \\"adult plot\\" hard to appreciate.
B0000039LE|1.0|why do people like this trash it isn't scary nor interesting and the movie is slow paced that it looks like director John Carpenter shot this while walking slowly and the movie is low budget there is hardly any blood or good special effects instead fans like it for its so-called suspense and laughable scares. The main plot is a boy who murdered his sister and returns years later to kill babysitters in his hometown. Halloween is no treat but a trick. Fans of horror films should rent something better. The only good part is when Jamie Lee Curtis is laying on the ground and in the background Michael Myers sits up slowly looking at her.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|While \\"falling in love\\" comes at the end of most romantic movies, \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\"  takes us beyond the fuzzy feelings and cloud-nine ecstasy of new love, to investigate what happens after.  The film tells the story of the love affair between Joel (a surprisingly subtle Jim Carrey) and Clementine (a refreshingly vivacious Kate Winslet) in reverse time.  That is, when we first meet them, they have  already broken up, Clementine has gone to a memory-erasing clinic to have all memory of Joel erased from her mind, and Joel has gone and done the same thing.  We are then taken through a sequence of Joel's memories of Clementine as the clinic's technicians remove these memories.  By the end of the movie, Joel and Clementine have just met, and the first flutterings of love are just beginning.   <br /> <br />The result is a film that deals more truly and honestly with human emotions and human relationships than many other films out there on the store shelves.  How are our emotions connected to our memories?  Why do we fall out of love?  How do we \\"get over\\" our former lovers - by realising how truly horrible they are, or in fact, by forgetting the things about them that completely enthralled us to begin with? How do we remember?  Why does child-like infatuation blossom into love, which in turn settles down into regular familiarity, which leads to us taking our partners for granted, which leads to exasperation, contempt, and finally, indifference?   <br /> <br />\\"Eternal Sunshine\\" deals with these questions and so much more, which is why this movie should be watched again and again.  Moreover, I would suggest getting the 2-Disc Collector's Edition, because the special features which explain the technical aspects of the film will lead to a new appreciation of this gem of a movie.  The special effects in the movie are one-part computer-generated wizardry, one-part old-fashioned trap-door / secret hatches / mirror and angles tricks.  The conversations withJim Carrey (on the first disc - look out for Carrey driving a bed through the streets at night) and Kate Winslet (on the second disc - she does a great impression of Michel Gondry's Frenglish) are brilliant.    <br /> <br />\\"Eternal Sunshine\\" is worth the investment in time and money.  It's a bit like a love affair itself - its rewards are priceless.
0790744295|5.0|Creepshow is a well made horror/comedy from writer Stephen King and director George Romero. The movie is five tales about a man rising from dead wanting revenge,a dumb farmer(King) that had a meteorite landing on his farm and then turning him into a plant and his whole farmland turns the color green,a millionare buries a man on the beach and him and his dead girlfriend come back and take their revenge,a monster in a crate,and a professor and his loathe of cockroaches. Each tale is well made and well directed though the third one is the weakest the last one is the best. The movie is directed like a comic book with red and blue lighting in the scenes looking like a comic and there is cartoon segments. Anchor Bay needs to release a special edition just like they did with Creepshow 2(Decent sequel). The VHS version is the best way to watch while the DVD is bare-bones and fans complain the picture and transfer is terrible. The cast is good and includes E.G. Marshall,Adrienne Barbeau,Ted Danson,Leslie Nielsen,Hal Holbrook,Ed Harris,and Stephen King. Every horror/comedy fan should have Creepshow in their collection.
B00064MW6K|3.0|I'm surprised at some of the reviews here, actually.  It seems we have become a society of cinematic snobs, demanding high quality, oscar winning scripts, directors, and special effects in each film and television show we see.  With such demands, its no wonder the cost effectiveness of reality TV has come on so big.   <br /> <br />Halle Berry was, of course, the main reason to see this movie.  She had a smoldering, sexy intensity as the main character, and of course, it is pleasing to the male hormones to see her strutting around wearing a leather cat outfit, snapping a whip.  Admittably, Sharon Stone did not bring anything to this film, as she spoke her lines rather than recite them, and the idea of giving her some sort of unique super power at the end was just plain silly.  <br /> <br />Otherwise, I think this had all the makings of a great super hero film.  The conflict of a secret identity versus the real person, the flawed romance, the sinister plot, and of course, the ending that left the way open for a sequel.  These are the exact same things that made the original Batman and more recently Spider-Man great movies.   <br /> <br />And I have to admit, the scenes that involved Halle Berry behaving in catlike manners (scarfing tuna, oggling fish in a fishtank) made me laugh, as they reminded me, and I suspect anyone who see's this movie, of the every-day behavior of my own cat.   <br /> <br />This movie was not meant to be an oscar winner, or a mega-blockbuster (althought it definitely did not meet studio expecations in its release).  It was meant to be just plain entertaining, a great way to spend a couple of hours on a boring afternoon.  Sadly, it fails to meet alot of expectations, largely propped up by recent earth-shaking hits like Spider-Man.   <br /> <br />Don't rent or buy this if you are looking for a life-altering film. Do rent it if you want to be entetained.
B00000GBHA|5.0|Rodriquez's daughter Eva, was a good friend of mine when she was in the Army. She mentioned once, almost passingly, that her father was a musician. She diverted my questions so I thought he must have been some studio musician or the like, at best. I'd lost track of Eva and wanted to say hello. While searching for her I ran across web-pages devoted to her father; he's a very big deal overseas (South Africa and Australia especially, it seems).     Curious, I ordered this album and absolutely loved it! So, the question is: Eva, why didn't you tell me what a wonderful singer/songwriter your Dad is?
B0006AZMFM|4.0|I Really like this album, the songs are pretty and they are really nice to hear but the absolute problem with this album is apart from the title track, \\"Mistaken Identity\\", all the songs sound the same to me, its strange but they just all sound alike! Its the ultimate problem with this album, otherwise its just as pretty and  lyrically beautiful as 2003's \\"Innocent Eyes\\". There is like only 1 upbeat song on this so yeah. My personal faves are:<br /><br />Mistaken Identity<br /><br />The Analyst<br /><br />Extraordinary Day (I like it a bit yeah its good)<br /><br />Be Strong (my ultimate fave on the album)<br /><br />Electric Storm<br /><br />Almost Here<br /><br />Sanctuary (hey this is a bit upbeat)<br /><br />Last Night On Earth (soooooo pretty!)<br /><br />Fragile<br /><br />Yeah the rest are still good but not as great as these key trakcs<br /><br />The worst on the album I have to say is \\"Miscommunication\\"<br /><br />I really like this though, really reccomended there is a hidden track on the last track about 5 mins later, its kind of an angry song thats how I can sum it up!<br /><br />THE DVD:<br /><br />I love this special edition packaging though!<br /><br />The DVD is ok aswell, a bit short thoough, the track by track interview is entertaining<br /><br />Another complaint is, well I know Delta battled cancer and all but nearly all of these songs have to revolve around that incident though, its not bad cuz the songs are beaytiful, but I dont think she shouldve based nearly all of her songs on this. She does use the incident wisely though with great lyrics like \\"The girl in the chair with the long golden hair\\" (on the title track) which was obviously herself before she got diagnosed with cancer.<br /><br />Also as Delta says she really has a facination with weather on this album!<br /><br />SUM UP:<br /><br />Well Deltas second album is totally worth it to buy but is unfortunatly not as great as the 14x platinum \\"Innocent Eyes\\"<br /><br />I hope this is equally as succesful as \\"Innocent Eyes\\" because this deserves it! Its a really nice album to hear!<br /><br />Think Missy Higgins with more oomph! Thats how I would sum up this album!/>Think Missy Higgins with more oomph! Thats how I would sum up this album!
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is probbably one of the best Linkin Park wil ever make. It mixes raock with hip-hop creating one of the best albums ever. The hit single \\"Numb\\" is only one of the reasons to buy this album.
0780626966|5.0|I've been a huge fan of \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\" since I was seven years old. I remember the first time I saw Mr. Krueger in \\"Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare,\\" I became an instant fan. I wasn't terrified because the series had gotten to the point where the only thing Freddy did was kill teenagers and crack jokes, but it was okay. I even remember dressing up as the dream demon for Halloween that year. I'm a huge fan of horror movies now, and I owe it all to this series. Anyways, on with the review. This is quite possibly the best DVD box set I have ever seen. I've never seen so many extras in my life. The first night I had this set, it took me about three to four hours just to watch the entire bonus disc, entitled \\"The Nightmare Series Encyclopedia\\", which includes the \\"Welcome to Primetime\\" documentary and \\"The Labyrinth\\" maze game that reveals more extras. This puzzled me at first, but once I got the hang of it, everything worked out. The caged door puzzle still confuses me because I have no idea if there are any other features in this fixture, even though the main one here is the second alternate ending to the first movie (sorry if I gave it away lol). As far as the movies go, the first \\"Nightmare\\" will always be my favorite because it set the series in stone, showcased Johnny Depp in one of his first starring roles, and turned Freddy Krueger into a household name. Unlike a lot of people, I actually like \\"Freddy's Revenge,\\" but that doesn't mean that I'm putting it at the top. The rules for this follow-up may have been broken, but I still consider it to be a good movie, despite it's script problems. Plus, there are many funny parts to it and a Freddy who still hadn't shown his comical side to all admirers. Therefore, it comes in at #6 on my list. \\"Dream Warriors\\" ranks at #2 on my personal list because it not only brought Wes Craven back to the series as a writer, but also marked the return of Heather Langenkamp to the role of Nancy and John Saxon as her father, Lieutenant Thompson. This film also starred a young Laurence Fishburne and introduced the world to director and screenplay writer Charles Russell (\\"The Mask,\\" \\"The Scorpion King\\"), his writing partner Frank Darabont, and a young girl by the name of Patricia Arquette. Also, you couldn't beat the special effects on this sequel. \\"The Dream Master\\" ranks at #3 on my list because there was a great storyline and great characters, including Kristen (this time played by Tuesday Knight), Kincaid, Joey, Alice, and Rick. There is also one of the greatest lines in series history in this sequel (\\"I am eternal.\\").You really can't top the final fight scene between Freddy and Alice or Renny Harlin's direction for this film. \\"The Dream Child\\" comes in at #7, or last, on the list because it really didn't seem as well done as any of it's predecessors. The fact that an unborn child can have nightmares seems ludicrous, but it still turned out to be a good movie, even though it is at the bottom of the barrel. There is a great song from Kool Moe Dee during the end credits, but I can't leave out the Whodini video that is included on the bonus disc of this collection. \\"Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare\\" comes in at #5 on the list. I once considered it to be the second best because it got me hooked onto Krueger Juice, but it doesn't beat the storylines of parts one, three, four, or seven. The great thing about this disc in the set is that it comes with two pairs of 3-D  glasses for the final fifteen minutes, which is totally exclusive because it was the first ever 3-D DVD. This totally adds to the experience. The movies good because it had a great role for Yaphet Kotto as Doc, the guy who mentors these kids at a homeless shelter, but I've also gotta give props to Lisa Zane as Maggie, the person who runs this home for troubled teens. We also get a first look at a young Breckin Meyer in the role of the pot smoking, video game addicted Spencer. Freddy's more comical in this sequel, but still entertaining. And finally, \\"Wes Craven's New Nightmare\\" comes in at #4 on the list. This film is extraordinary because Freddy is found in real life and begins haunting Heather Langenkamp and her young son. Cameos in this film include Wes Craven, head of New Line Cinema, Robert Shaye, Tuesday Knight, and, of course, Robert Englund. This movie didn't fare well at the box office, but still proved to be one of the series' best entries. This movie could also possibly be looked at as a prequel to the \\"Scream\\" trilogy. Don't count this movie out for anything. So, once again, here are the rankings:  <br />1.) \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\"  <br />2.) \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors\\"  <br />3.) \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master\\"  <br />4.) \\"Wes Craven's New Nightmare\\"  <br />5.) \\"Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare\\"  <br />6.) \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge\\"  <br />7.) \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child\\"  <br />So, with all that being said, if you're a big fan of Wes Craven, Freddy Krueger, or horror, in general, be sure to pick up this set. And remember, \\"whatever you do, don't fall asleep.\\" Sweet dreams. Ha ha ha ha ha!!!
B0002O06N0|5.0|This is such a refreshing breath of air into mainstream rock n roll. Most bands corrupting the airwaves these days all play the same bland nu-metal and pop punk garbage, originality is seldom found in this age. However the Black Keys often are compared to the White Stripes and I can hear the same raw blues feel but the Keys certainly explore the genre a lot more capably and with a certain flair the Stripes often are incapable of. Another parallel often spoken of is their minimalist two part combo, their sound is stripped down and raw. No bass, simply raw and gritty blues chords and primal backbone beats. Dan Auerbach sounds like a old wise bluesman and his vocals speak volumes, he sounds as if he's seen plenty of losses and can easily lament them all. Pat Carney's solid drumming keeps things intact; holds this rollercoaster of an album on course, a great drummer, not too flashy and not too subtle just right on track keeping the time in a solid and admirable manner. Listening to Rubber Factory brings to mind an old greasy mill thats grumbling back into life as the band plugs its old monstorous amps up and lets its mighty roar be heard. Of course this comparison is justified, the Keys recorded the album in an old rubber factory turned makeshift studio(hence the title). Anyways if your a blues fan and looking for something fesh to sink your teeth into than this album is definitely your best bet. One of the best albums of 2004.
B00005JNJT|1.0|But they HAD to put overrated Katie Holmes in the movie. Sick.
B0002XDODU|5.0|This album is one of the best of 2004, for me is the second best behind Mutter of this excellent band, with sounds that you don't expect. <br /> <br />1.- Reise, Reise 5/5: This song is definitely the best of the entire record, with the accordion at the end you know good music is coming. (rewind to negative time, a surprise is waiting) <br /> <br />2.- Mein Teil 4/5: this song is the hardest no doubt about it, love the voice of Till. The scream is not a good part of the song. <br /> <br />3.- Dalai Lama 4/5: A good creepy song. Although is too long still very good. <br /> <br />4.- Keine Lust 5/5: Funny song and really interesting. The usual guitar sound of Rammstein appears in this song. <br /> <br />5.- Los 5/5: The first time I heard this song I just couldn't believed it, acoustic guitars and a catchy rythm makes this song one of the best. <br /> <br />6.- Amerika 5/5: Amazing song with excellent choruses, it reflects the americanisation of the world in a very cool way. <br /> <br />7.- Moskau 4/5: Good song, it's in russian and german, and is very interesting the mix of till and the russian girl, Viktoria Fersh is her name. It gets too repetitive at the end. <br /> <br />8.- Morgenstern 5/5: The best intro on the album and it gets better when the chorus appears. It's a great piece of music. <br /> <br />9.- Stein um Stein 5/5: The roughest song. Type of \\"I hate you\\" song but with a really cool way to say it. <br /> <br />10.- Ohne Dich 5/5: Beautiful. Sadness. Desperation. You can find this in here. Absolutely incredible. I didn't expect this, is beautiful. <br /> <br />11.- Amour 5/5: The best way to close the album, a perfect way to describe love if you were hurt by it. <br /> <br />To close, this album is definitely worth it.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|I have to wonder who approves these projects in Hollywood.  I guess the execs felt safe retelling an old story using big-name stars.  But the end product was just another empty action adventure with cardboard cut-out characters.  While Russell Crowe was inspiring in Gladiator, Brad Pitt falls flat as Achilles.  Frankly he is not a very good actor and has done nothing noteworthy since Fight Club.  I was not bored by this movie, but I was also not moved by it either.  Its worth renting, but noting more.
6305718954|1.0|I sat down to watch this movie, and I was very relzxed and comfortable. Five minutes later my head was pounding, the introduction set a scene for a disorganised and painful film that I wish I never saw.  <br /> <br />The story line was often confusing and there were many unnecesary scenes. An attempt at \\"style\\" is worth mentioning but the key word is ATTEMPT. There were times when you were amazed by the sheer beauty of a shot, but that was soon eclipsed by overpowering music, graphic violence or sporatic camera movement.  <br /> <br />There were far too many holes in the plot, very few if any questions are ever answered. The ending does not succeed in passing it's message to the viewer. You feel virtually no sympathy for any of the characters and you even grow to hate them <br /> <br />Finally the movie leaves you with a feeling of dread and you feel drained It is not a pleasent experience
B00005JMJ4|5.0|What a beautiful, thoughtful and sweet movie this is.  Sofia Coppola is a brilliant storyteller and has crafted a film with more warmth, heart and intelligence than most films out today. <br /> <br />Casting Bill Murray in this role might be the best casting choice of 2003.  He is so wonderful as this character because, honestly, in many ways he is this character.  As Murray has aged we have seen less and less of him, and there was a point where it would have been very easy for him to cross the threshold into has-been or, worse, self-parody.  He did hold on, albeit not with the same superstar power he once held, and has managed to grow and mature into one of the best, most underrated actors of our day.  Who would have thought that would be possible? As for Scarlett Johansson, again with the great casting choice.  She has the freshness, vulnerability and energy to carry this off, yet such depth and maturity as well.  She is wise beyond her years and yet still so young, and a gifted actress.  There is chemistry beyond chemistry between these two and that's a big reason the film works, because with less talented or poorly matched actors we might be a bit turned-off by the age difference between them, yet I found myself wanting things to work out for them even when I knew it couldn't be.  And the fact that Coppola was honest and true to the characters she created instead of taking the easy way out speaks volumes of her integrity as an artist.  We have been conditioned to look for the happy ending, and our version of \\"happy ending\\" is \\"happy ending in bed\\".  But these are real people on the screen, with real lives and real consequences which they cannot forget about.  And their decision to remain true to the others in their lives, their understanding of the imposibility of their being together, is much more moving than any climactic (no pun intended) romp in bed could ever be.  The final scene alone speaks volumes, though nothing is really said between them.  But we knowthey understand each other, and we can see that it's enough for them.  So it becomes enough for us, if we're willing to cast aside our pre-conditioned notions of \\"romance\\" and remember that not everything we want is truly meant to be. <br />Everything about this film is just so perfect.  Tokyo is bright, beautiful and exciting.  The dialogue is tremendous, most especially in the quiet, intimate conversations which are seemingly meaningless but are actually the meat of what makes the characters.  It takes greater talent to pull off a scene like that than a highly-charged emotional one.  And the message is so heartbreaking and beautiful....like Don Quixote said, \\"to love pure and chaste from afar\\"....In this case, it's much more affective. <br />
0140131558|5.0|Taken cumulatively, Paul Auster's \\"New York Trilogy\\" is one of the most amazing books I've read in a long time. No matter how much of a seasoned reader you are, these three novellas make you look at the very act of reading in a completely new light. <br /> <br />Perhaps the most incredible feat accomplished here is how the thematic material echoes throughout each page and between novellas. Everything from detective conventions to names to literary authors to images weave and flow throughout these works changing and gaining in import each time like a Bachian theme and variations.  <br /> <br />Even when things don't seem to go as smoothly, the results are thought-provoking. For instance, I was a bit put off by the end of \\"City of Glass.\\" However, this feeling of dissatisfaction in light of such a metafictional text made me question myself - why was I dissatisfied? I discovered that I expect some sort of minimal optimism at the conclusion of texts - even if it's a tragedy, at least it should in its negation show something life-affirming. This is eventually accomplished even for the end of \\"Glass\\" once one views it in context of the whole trilogy, but even if it hadn't been, forcing me to confront my own expectations has been invaluable! <br /> <br />These are works in which every word has been carefully judged yet nothing seems ponderous or overstated. The language is simple, direct and incredibly clear and concise. One comes across a book like this rarely - do yourself a favor and devour it!   <br />
B0000WN0VY|3.0|Just to set the record straight. I have the CD/DVD Limited Edition and I am reviewing this as a whole - as presented according to it's price and the music contents.<br /><br />Damien Rice is one of those singers with a distinctive voice. And when you listen to his music, you realize it is a perfect match. His music is classified as Folk. Some people go so far as stating his music his beyond genre, but that's just pushing it. I believe it is Alternative/Contemporary Folk.<br /><br />If you bought this album, you obviously appreciate these kinds of music genre. If you've heard of him only because of the trailer from \\"Closer\\", that's exactly the kind of music you will get from the whole album. It isn't pop. And that's a good thing. I appreciate all kinds of music, but I am awed at artists from their respective genres who can create outstanding albums that separate it from the rest of the pack.<br /><br />In this case, \\"o\\" is one of those instances. I don't really buy these kinds of music, but I gave notice at his album more than a year ago at Virgin Megastore when it was being sold for USD9.99. I gave a listen and couldn't put the headphones down.<br /><br />For me, \\"Volcano\\" is still the best track in this album. It is here thaat you will give notice to the vocals of Lisa Hannigan and the cello by Vyvienne Long. \\"The Blower's Daughter\\", which was given notice due to the trailer of the movie \\"Closer\\". It is also the reason why the same album is now being sold for USD18.99 at most music stores and USD13.99 at Amazon. Anyway, as he sings until the end \\"...I can't take my mind off you...\\" he continues to say it until the very end like a person really in longing.<br /><br />But from track 1 alone, \\"Delicate\\" you are instantly sucked in the world of the artist and you can feel the songs he and his fellow bandmates play. Go ahead and listen on and \\"Cannonball\\" is another great song.<br /><br />Best to listen with professional studio monitor speakers and/or quality headphones like Sennheiser brands. Why? So you can hear the subtelty of the instruments and vocals.<br /><br />All in all the content (songs) is rated 5 STARS out of 5.<br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />DVD<br /><br />Now on to the whole price and packaging Limited Edition label. That's the reason why it's rated 3 stars. Why sell it at that price? The DVD doesn't contain anything except 3 videos from AOL sessions - \\"Cannonball\\", \\"The Blower's Daughter\\" and \\"Volcano\\".<br /><br />The videos are shot perfectly, just like the songs. It is in black and white and recorded live. The three most important people in the album are the only ones playing - Damien Rice, vocals and guitar; Lisa Hannigan, vocals; Vyvienne Long, cello.<br /><br />Most people will not notice it, but the compression of the videos aren't that good as it seems. There are artifacting. For a DVD with only three video contents, they could have processed this at a higher bit rate. The space is there on the disc already, why waste it.<br /><br />I would also appreciate if this was processed in DTS (doesn't have to be surround sound), but that would allow a higher audio quality than the Dolby 2.0 it was compressed in.<br /><br />The DVD contents size is 788.1MB out of a possible 4.7GB for one side. You get the idea.<br /><br />Also on the disc, when you click on the web site link it will tell you that there \\"contains a ROM section with links to more information and content...simply insert the disc into the DVD-ROM drive, open the ROM folder and double-click the weblink.html file.\\" So I did. I clicked on the html file and it opened my browser and brought me to the web page of the artist. Huh? That's it. No special link or feature to say \\"thanks for buying this more expensive edition.\\" None. It's just one small html file to bring me to his front web page. Why not just tell me in the first place to go to [...] It's as easy as that than going to the ROM folder and opening the file and...It just makes the buyer feel stupid. You don't need to treat us like that. We know a special feature when we see one. And this isn't one of them.<br /><br />The DVD rating is 1 STAR out of 5. This, and the ridiculous pricing, is the reason why this whole so-called limited edition package is only 3 STARS.<br /><br />Yes, the DVD packaging is cool. It is definitely apart from the plastic CD cases on shelves. The cover has a nice texture and it looks like a small photo album. Inside are a few pages of original artwork illustrations with hand-written lyrics that I can't barely read. On the last page b+w photos in thumbnail sizes - best to be kept for the bandmates to enjoy.<br /><br />The CD and DVD, disappointingly is packaged and STUFFED in one normal white envelope. After all this great packaging, they finally run out of ideas and just paste the envelope in the end page and and put a white divider (the same material as the envelope) to separate the CD and DVD. So thanks to that ingenious packaging, you have to carefully remove either one unless you are like the rest who just grabs a CD/DVD by your fingers and oil the whole playing side. And then you wonder why there are scratches and skips after a while. Hmm.<br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />The DVD should be given free for Heaven's sake! There is nothing special or limited about it that it doesn't deserve the price. There are tons of albums with included DVDs already and they have the audacity to sell this for USD4.50 more. To think the original price of this Limited Edition is USD21.98. Imagine that if it was actually sold at that price level. Gosh.<br /><br />For the sake of fans and people who want to discover the artist, scrap the normal album and sell this at the lowest price possible.<br /><br />The videos can be downloaded and viewed online. So don't waste your money unless you are into limited editions. You don't need the DVD to enjoy all the great songs available either way. Buy the cheaper album which contains the exact songs and enjoy the music the artist has to offer then come back and rate it 5 STARS.<br /><br />Hope this helps.The DVD rating is 1 STAR out of 5.

B0000AXE8I|2.0|...that's the sound of selling out.  Got the second star because I stayed awake and didn't vomit.
B00005JMXX|3.0|The Day After Tomorrow had a very high budget. Clearly because of the eye-opening special effects. The plot is overthought. It is disturbing, though, especially now due to the effects of the Tsunami in Southeast Asia and so on. It is thouroughly depressing but is not exaggerated. Nothing that happened in it would not have happened in one of these kind of storms. So, therefore, nothing much is really called for by the actors. All of the performances are basic. I don't feel that the story really touched on an emotional level. But the special effects keeps the movie exciting. Though, if a storm like this hit and only those few people survived, that's farfetched. This is definitely a ride, but overall, just a movie that's fun to look at. If you're gonna get this, just make sure you get widescreen. It's much better because the visuals are more visual.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|How can anybody even call this \\"music\\"?  Its so noisy.  Avril's voice is so harsh and screechy that it could strip paint from the walls.  The guitars and bass grind and roar, and they sound more like chainsaws going at full speed than musical instruments.  The guitars and bass don't play any riffs at all.  It just sounds like someone randomly banging the strings with a piece of cement.  The drumming sounds more like someone breaking rocks with a jackhammer.  The sound quality is VERY poor.  It sounds like it was recorded over the telephone. <br /> <br />The lyrics are wordy and awkward.  The rhymes are clumsy and jerky, and they interrupt the rythem of the songs: <br />Ex: \\"Get out of my head <br />....Get off my bed <br />....Yeah, thats what I said. <br /> <br />Or \\"I thought I liked you a lot <br />....I'm gonna ask you to stop <br />....because I'm really upset, really upset. <br /> <br />The negativity in her songs is unbearable.  She never sings about anything positive.  All she does is whine and complain about how awful her life is.   <br /> <br />Another reason why Avril sucks is because she is  a bad influence on her fans.  Its not a good idea to expose her young, impressionable fans to so much negativity.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Nora Jones is a wonderful talent.  This CD surprises while it becomes predictable , excites while it sooths and seduces one quite successfully. Listening to this CD is like drinking cognac: it's smooth on the way down, but is quite fiery when it lands.  The lyrics show a great talent and the music is beautiful. <br /> <br />Since the review should be at least 75 words long, I will expound.  Ms. Jones' smoky, sexy voice is almost unheard of in this day of pop princesses who are hopefully here today and gone tomorrow.  She puts one in the mind of Diana Krall and Ella Fitzgerald. Fierce and tender and full of talent.
B00005LC1H|5.0|As a teenager, I became hooked on the local PBS station, in large part due to the number of BBC produced sitcoms they would show. \\"Are You Being Served?\\", \\"Man About The House\\", and most notably \\"Fawlty Towers.\\"    As a big \\"Monty Python\\" fan, I was totally unprepared for the more sophisticated humor in \\"Fawlty Towers\\". John Cleese as Basil Fawlty, the proprietor of a somewhat dodgy inn, is as over the top in this series as he ever was. Fans of Cleese's contributions to Python won't be disappointed.     Basil is rude, incompetent and extremely condescending. He consistently attempts to bully his patrons into following his own schedule, adapting to his own mannerisms and submitting to his will in general. Unfortunately for Basil, most of the patrons staying at the inn refuse to conform, and rightly so. The end result usually involves Basil being disgraced, humiliated and deflated.     Basil's wife Sybil, played by Prunella Scales, is bossy, lazy and ineffective. Half of Sybil's life seems dedicated to barking orders to her husband, the other half to talking on the phone, chatting with customers or eating bon-bons.    Polly, the maid/waitress, serves as Basil's partner in crime. When things go wrong, and they always do, it becomes Polly's job to help hide the evidence, usually from Sybil.    Manuel is from Barcelona.    Each episode of \\"Fawlty Towers\\" is truly a comedy of errors, the moral of which (if one needs a moral) might be: \\"Don't be like Basil.\\" As things snowball out of control, Basil's and Polly's attempts to get a handle on the situation (usually while keeping everything from Sybil) result in some of the best comedic moments in television history.    Each episode of the series is completely unique and may be watched separately; it doesn't take long to catch on to the characters and how they interact. Additionally, Cleese and Booth  put their unique stamp on the script, with lines just as quotable as anything from \\"Monty Python\\" or \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to theGalaxy\\".     Because there are only 12 episodes total, the writing, the acting and the laughs stay top notch throughout. This isn't a collection one buys to get a couple of favorite episodes. The extras on the DVD mirror the series by being just right. Some commentary, some interviews, a couple of sidepieces, and that's it. No Hollywood flash, just things that will interest any fan of the series.    One of the things I liked best about \\"Fawlty Towers\\" when watching it years ago, was that I could watch it with my Dad. The humor isn't universal. Some of it is dark, and most definitely a bit offbeat. Still, it's accessible enough that many people who don't care about the Spanish Inquisition, much less whether anyone expects it or not, will enjoy the train wreck that is Basil Fawlty.
0385510454|2.0|Unlike many other reviewers, I felt as if most of the Broker lacked the energy that drives so many of Grisham's other novels.  Much of the book is dominated by lectures in Italian language and culture.  I was not excited by the tours of Bologna and it's numerous coffee shops.  It was as if I were watching homes movies of a relative's recent Christmas vacation to Italy.  The overall plot of the story was good, but one must overlook 75% of the book to get to the plot and chase.  I personally was disappointed and often had no trouble putting the book down.
B000002P48|4.0|For the casual Skynyrd fan, this is the CD to own. With familiar hits in Tuesday's Gone, Gimme Three Steps, Simple Man, and Freebird...you cannot go wrong. This great re-issue includes lyrics along with not-so famous songs (Mississippi Kid and Poison Whiskey). Only 8 tracks, but the emotion these great songs exude is worth every cent.
1592400876|5.0|\\"If there is one lesson to be learned from this book,\\" says the author at about the halfway point, \\"it is that there is never a dull moment in the world of punctuation.\\"  That's something I would not have believed before reading Eats, Shoots & Leaves, but today I'm here to tell you that it's true. Who would have thought that a book about punctuation could be such an absolute joy? I had so much fun reading this one that I finished it in less than forty-eight hours because I simply could not put it down.<br /><br />Eats, Shoots & Leaves was written for people who, like myself, experience a visceral reaction to the blatant forms of punctuation abuse that pervade written English. It is less of an instructional book and more of a public venting of frustration by Ms. Truss, who somehow managed to write a book about punctuation that is all at once funny, witty, and entertaining, yet still very much instructional as well. If confusion of \\"its\\" and \\"it's\\" is the kind of transgression that drives you to the brink of violence, you are almost certainly a \\"stickler\\" of the magnitude discussed in the book; the kind of person who believes that people who commit such egregious offenses, \\"deserve to be struck by lightning, hacked up on the spot and buried in an unmarked grave.\\" In fact, I may very well have committed a similar but less serious offense by using a semicolon in that last sentence as I did, but I'm sticking with it, and that's that.<br /><br />My point is simply that anyone who appreciates proper use of punctuation, who has a wry sense of humor, and who sometimes feels like they are the last person on Earth who still cares about this subject will almost certainly enjoy reading this book. And when you really get down to it, that's what matters the most.
0800141660|4.0|Anyone who sees \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" first will be disapointed. Not that the film makers didn't stick to the book, they did, and very well. But the plot is no where near as fast paced as the former. I read \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and absolutly loved it, as does everyone who reads it. So I began reading the others. None measure up. But this movie is ok. Despite Hugh Grant's performance, which comes off as being quite immature. Yes, Edward was shy, but he didn't behave like a little boy. Everyone else was perfect for their roles. Especialy Fanny. They did clip out a few chracters, but it is for the best. They would have complicated things too much for a movie. Over all a pretty decent film.
B0006399FS|1.0|The two singles are uncharacteristic of post-War U2 in that they rock most heavily. The rest of the album is typical post-Unforgettable Fire pablum. Awful. Look for mine for sale online at half-dot-com soon!
0060090367|5.0|I love books that make me laugh out loud and this one certainly did. The plot was very true to life with such a positive outlook to the future! All of the characters were so unique and quirky. They all brought something special to the story. I highly recommend Watermelon to anyone who wants a heartfelt, funny book!<br /><br />If you are looking for a book with lots of laughs and lots of tears, but which makes you look at life differently, then this is definitely the book for you! This is the first book that I have ever laughed out loud at, as well as cry!
0385510454|5.0|So says John Grisham in his note on the second to last page of the book.  Technology is not his bag, but law sure is.  So with that know how and experience in crafting 17 previous best sellers, he concocts a fictitious, yet believable story about a Wahington big wig who gets sent to the slammer for 6 years for, in actuality, possession of highly sensitive information.  Then he gets a pardon from the outgoing President who lost the election having received only 3 electoral votes from the state of Alaska.  All that info is in the first 3 pages of the book which had me laughing so much that my family outside my room was wondering what was so funny.  It was the circumstances surrounding the failed campaign and the future prospects of President Morgan that gave me the giggles.  So I read to my family what I had read and soon everyone was laughing.  Read it off and on within 48 hours, would've finished it last night but had picked it up too late in the day.  It would be a good movie script.<br /><br />One of my favorite lines is of Joel Backman, the power broker/big wig, who's running for his life.  Six years of jail made him somewhat repentant as he berates himself: \\"For the first time in your rotten life, why don't you do what's right, as opposed to what's profitable.\\"
B00006M183|4.0|Its pretty damn good. An album i consider nearly as the ten album. Some songs do lack the typical kick ass guitar riffs, and excitement, but its a very very sad melody album. Which in the time frame, when it was release, was almost to perfect. Ive probably worn the cd out about now. All songs are good as the next. Thumbing my way back to heaven, is the most spiritual song ive ever heard from pearl jam, other than jeremy. I love this cd so much that i play it when im sad, it really just let you sit and think with out tearing up your ear. Would not listen to the other post's on here, they give free sample be the judge for yourself, i went out and paid 10 bucks or so, you should be able to get it at that price now. Track 8, \\"love is the tower, and you are the key\\"  if he's not an romantic poet, then i dont know what he is. Ive always love Pearl Jam's music and cant wait till they get a contract, if they have already then im not being the loyal fan and finding it out yet, and a new cd on the shelf at their pace and not be rushed as they were with this one. But dont get me wrong Track 9 is an kick ass song too. Very fast with your kick ass pj guitar riffs. AWSOME! :) WHAT THE HELL BUY THE ALBUM, MAKE THEM THINK ITS WORTH IT. Maybe they'll do better than ever next time around.
0671027344|5.0|I only read this book because my best friend who attends UCLA as a freshman this year told me that I should read it. After getting the book I started to read it on a Monday morning...on Monday afternoon at around 12 pm the school bell rang for seniors. I went out to my car and sat reading the last 15 pages. By the time I was done I was crying and calling my best friend. <br /> <br />Charlie seems simplistic at first and he does seems like June Cleavers boy at first...but then you seem to realize that he is different some how...His crush on his friend is adorable but kind of heartbreaking, while his friendship with her gay brother is funny and seemingly perfect. He's definitely a wallflower. True, do not expect Catcher in the Rye from this book, but do not expect the dreariness Of Mice and Men from this book either. This book is paving a new road, the author seems to want to stand out, not blend with other great writers...and that is what makes him great. Of all the books I have read, this one still remains my favorite because it is simple...but it's simple because life is not truly a hyped up, Dawson's Creek style orgy...it's life. It's dull, it's boring, it's exciting, dull again and then it's over. Perks captured that. Perks is showing the true high school experience without the blinding Friday night lights which the rest of us middle class, B average students missed out on...because I swear, this is the high school life I had. And in that one moment where you realize that you are reading about yourself, you'll be infinite. <br />BW~ <br />
0743454529|5.0|I believe it was in Reader's Digest Magazine that I first heard of and read about My Sister's Keeper, and Jodi Picoult. The thing that hooked me was a comment that the author's teenage son, having read the book and been moved to tears by it, was so touched in fact that he needed time to digest it before he could discuss the story with his mother. At that moment, I knew I wanted to read this book. <br /> <br />At once it is a simple and complex story: teenage girl (Anna) wants the right to refuse to be a medical donor for her older sister (Kate), so she finds a lawyer willing to take her case pro bono. Of course, if she gets her wish, her sister will die, as she's suffering from leukemia and kidney failure. Throw in all of the typical issues plaguing teens, and families in general for that matter, and you can see how this story can quickly grow intricate. <br /> <br />As a parent, I can certainly understand the mother's point of view. Sara wants to do everything possible to save her first daughter, Kate. At the same time, however, I can completely understand Anna's fear, anger and frustration. <br /> <br />Ms. Picoult has made it incredibly easy to fall in love with her characters here, even the ones you believe at first sight to be the bad guys. And she does a masterful job portraying the everyday complexities of family life. You can't help but care about these characters. You might even find yourself taking time after reading this book to ponder your own life and family. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to writers of any genre, and any reader who appreciates reading about characters you can fall in love with and care about.
B00003CWL5|5.0|This movie, like the more recently released The Assassination of Richard Nixon, is centered around a middle aged man whose midlife crisis is causing his life to fall apart.  However, in this movie, unlike Assassination, the man in question (Kevin Spacey) has a bit more of a sense of humor.  The story begins with Spacey narrating from a place of being recently dead--so we know from the start that the movie is going to end tragically, although we do not know how.  Spacey seems, however, to be quite okay with the idea of being deceased.    Spacey is, basically, bored with his life.  He seems uninspired with his work and, in any event, there are rumors of downsizing when a new boss is hired.  His wife (Annette Benning) is more motivated, although not entirely successful, in her work as a real estate agent, and seems a bit disgusted with her husband's lackluster career.  Their relationship seems somewhat loveless (Spacey describes masturbating in the shower as the high point of his day).  His daughter (Thora Birch) is also very bored with life, and hangs out with a cheerleader friend (Mena Suvari) for whom Spacey eventually develops a strong crush.    The Fitts family moves in next door.  The father, a Colonel (Chris Cooper), is homophobic (and, we later discover, ironically also a closet gay) and abusive with his son and most likely his wife.  The mother (Allison Janney) is nearly catatonic for unexplained reasons that may have to do with abuse by Cooper.  The son (Wes Bentley) has spent time in a psych ward, but is also secretly a drug dealer and a rather successful one at that.    These characters set the stage for the characters' various antics that follow.  Spacey is ultimately fired from his job, but blackmails his employer into a hefty severance package.  He starts smoking marijuana with Bentley and develops a strong crush for Birch's friend Suvari when he overhears her expressing an interest in sleeping with him.  He uses the money from the severance package to buy a new car and basically starts living the life he wished he'd had in his youth.    Benning is increasingly disgusted with her husband's behavior--it seems he can do no right in her eyes--he is disgusted with him masturbating but equally disgusted with the idea of having sex with him.  She is much more attracted to the top local real estate agent, with whom she has an affair both because she finds him sexy and because she hopes to learn more about selling real estate from him.    16-year-old Birch is initially disgusted by Bentley's voyeuristic habits--he has a nasty habit of following her around and filming her with his camcorder.  Yet she eventually discovers his love for beauty in everything that he films, and, after a confrontation with her mother, poses bare breasted in the window as Bentley films her from next door.  Bentley is caught and violently confronted by his Marine Corps father.    This sets in motion the sequence of events that lead to the film's tragic end.  What is beautiful about this film is that the characters are not in total denial about their lives unravelling.  They know what is happening--the career problems, the marital breakdown, and the affairs--and yet all of the central characters, in their own way, are still able to see the beauty in life and to enjoy the positive, even with everything that is going wrong.  In fact, it is perhaps because of the pervasive theme of tragedy that they are more able to stop and enjoy life when given the opportunity.    So--in many ways, not an altogether happy movie, and yet a surprisingly uplifting one give the final outcome.  A well earned Oscar for best picture.
B00009W0U4|5.0|After notorious walkouts at Cannes and the controversy around the difficult, long, unrelenting rape scene, this was high on my must-see list of the last year. Not for voyeuristic reasons, but because, like A Clockwork Orange before it, the most controversial films are often those with the most to say. <br /> <br />This is not a date movie. Nor is it a pleasant, enjoyable experience. It is, however, pure cinema from a director working at the highest technical level, with the camera, with lighting, with makeup, with scripting and with performance.  <br /> <br />Irreversible is that rare beast, a self-contained experience which goes beyond the cinematic and aesthetic to show something real, both touching and frightening, beautiful and horrific, simple and innovative. The first twenty minutes are among the toughest you will encounter on the screen. The sound whines and hums, the camera spins in all directions, disorientating and showing glimpses of the scene. Dialogue is sparse, the same lines being repeated over and over again. The subject matter is unpleasant, taking place in a seedy gay club, the protagonists (Dupontel and Cassel) searching for someone called the Tenia (named after a tape-worm). And when they find him, there is a sequence which lasts maybe two minutes which is incredibly difficult to watch, yet difficult not to watch. Almost in disbelief, you cannot believe what you are watching is happening, yet marvel at how real it is, both technically and in terms of human character. <br /> <br />Beyond that, the film does not let up for about another half an hour, as the backwards-played story begins to piece itself together, leading to an act of provocation unrivalled in cinema history. It is the details of the rape that make it so shocking - her constant crying and squirming, his inherent joy at her discomfort, his pinning of her arms and gagging her mouth, the passer-by who sees the scene and walks away, unbeknownst to either of them. And when the long, unsettling scene is over, the greatest act of destruction occurs - the destruction of purity and beauty. Yet, as the film is told backwards, when the rape is over, we know there is more to come as we have already seen the aftermath. The brilliance is in naively praying it won't happen, resigned to the knowledge that it will. <br /> <br /> Without following the film through to the end(or the beginning), we would not know the reason that the director put these scenes in front of us. For me the greatest scenes are those that follow - the party scene, the subway journey of the three main characters, the post-dream awakening of the central couple - because they lift the film out of enfant terrible provocation and into a place of simultaneous beauty and pessimism, making sense of the journey all three characters are about to embark on. In particular the significance of dreams is a key theme, along with the linear, destructive power of time which the whole film is playing around with. <br /> <br />The film ends with the most difficult sequence to watch, the spinning beautiful image of Monica Bellucci prior to any of the events of the film followed by a strobe light effect which is physically difficult to watch, burning images and words into the brain. <br /> <br />Clearly Noe is a director intent on provoking a reaction and - thank God - it is impossible not to react to this film. You may hate it, you may admire it or you may be disgusted by it. All of these are perfect reactions to it. You cannot be indifferent to it. While it is undoubtedly a hard film to sit through, if you put in the effort it rewards in dividends. And it not only deserves but really requires multiple viewings, if you can stomach it. There is far more than can be taken in on the first visit, much to decipher and interpret that I will not spoil here. <br /> <br />While it does seem to reference the controversy of the aforementioned Kubrick classic - taking the violence and sexual abuse aspects to new levels,updating for a new generation - and even directly tips its hat to Kubrick - panning down from a poster of 2001 as classical music swells, before going into a psychadelic head-trip - this is a much harder, yet more humane film than Kubrick ever achieved. There is unpleasantness here, do not be fooled, but there is also insightful comment on the nature of humanity, instinct, violence, even love and relationships which alone makes the film worthy of appreciation. It is not a film all will be able to sit through - for a start, its subtitled! - but it is a film which deserves to be seen at least once by anyone with an appreciation of cinema. It is among the finest examples of modern French cinema available and one of the most intelligent and original films from anywhere in the last five years. <br /> <br />Finally, it wouldn't be right to hail the film without mentioning the performers. Monica Bellucci is outstanding in an undoubtedly difficult part, conveying the beauty, intelligence, womanliness, emotion and despair of Alex in a way that never screams \\"Moviestar!\\" and is always believable. Dupontel is wonderful in perhaps the film's most interesting role, a complex intellectual who, it is often overlooked, gives in to his most primal urges. He is sad, smart, witty and ultimately disturbed. But highest praise goes to Cassel, one of the most interesting actors working, who carries most of the film, emitting charm, energy, fear, shock, humour and weakness. It is hard not to focus on him in any given scene and impossible to catch him acting, high praise indeed given the other subjects which often fill the screen (not least the stunning Bellucci). Together, they are prime examples of true actors giving themselves over completely to their characters in a way that the likes of Nicole Kidman simply can't. They may be stars, but they are first and foremost brilliant performers. <br /> <br />Take caution, but do not miss if you get the chance.
0385504209|3.0|Robert Langdon a symbologist and Sophie Neveu a Cryptologist are paired together to solve the mysterious murder of a very respected Louvre Curator. Before dying of a bullet in his stomach, he has time to leave clues around the museum so that a secret he is the last living person to know about would not be lost forever. The 2 main characters are racing against time, trying to translate anagrams and solve riddles before both the police and some obscure religious group get their hands on them and what they are about to discover.<br /><br />The book is fast paced and written in a very simplistic style which makes all the weird religious stories in the book easy to understand. THe book starts off pretty well, it has quite a few suspensful moments which will make you keep turning pages. But as the story unfolds, the author seems to try and create too many twists, some of them way too far fetched. The ending is very anti-climatic and extremly disappointing. The characters remain very superficial throughout the story, they seem to have no feelings and you are left with the impression that you are reading about robots rather than human beings. None of the characters are interesting, i did not get to care about any of them and what would become of them. I've heard Steven Spielberg is going to direct the movie with Tom Hanks staring as Robert Langdon. I'll be very surprised to see how Hanks can portrait such a dull and boring character.<br /><br />[...]The underlying theme of the quest is absurd and i can understand that it would offend christians, mostly catholics. Yet this is fiction, it's supposed to be entertaining and not rewrite history. So if you are a devouted catholic who is very touchy on the subject of religion, this book is definitly not for you.<br /><br />It seems that everyone is reading this book these days and i had high expectations. It's just all hype, it's really just OK. Based on the idea of the story, the author could have done a much better job had he thought more about the ending and given a lot more depth to his characters.he thought more about the ending and given a lot more depth to his characters.
B000063DS1|2.0|Is there anything more sanctimonious than filming your last concert and inviting a bunch of fellow overrated hacks (Clapton, Neil Diamond, Joni Mitchell) to the occasion, as if it's some monumental event? Please! As if the Band were anything worthwhile in the first place. Sorry, but the whole concept of a bunch of Canadians (well, four of five anyway) writing this stuff about Americana always came across to me as pretentious -- and it doesn't get much worse than that stupid shot of Levon Helm wheezing through \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.\\" <br /> <br />These guys were just the beneficiaries of Rolling Stone/elitist rock critic propaganda. (And to think they made fun of prog bands for writing inane lyrics -- huh!) I think Martin Newell put it best when he called the Band \\"dreadful bearded ghastliness.\\" <br />
B000089CJI|4.0|The skittering beats and almost retro-video-game-like sounds on these songs might make you think that this record sounds trite, or unlistenable, or maybe even borderline ridiculous, but its the opposite of all these things. Ben Gibbard has penned some of his best, most personal lyrics ever for this album, and has firmly established himself as one of my all-time favorite songwriters. This is simply one of those records thats as deep as your imagination but is completely accessable the first time you hear it, much like U2 albums used to be. Strongly recommended for DCfC fans, or people who simply like solid, emotional music, or for anyone who happens to be breathing.
B000002BHE|5.0|This cd is just awesome. It is THE best cd in my collection and probably the best cd around (otherwise i'm seriously missing on something). I can't describe the greatness of this disc.  <br />It's all coming back to me now is the best song i've ever heard. Because you loved me and call the man get a 9.8/10 when you consider a 10 perfect. (the only other song worthy of a 10/10 is true colours by cyndi lauper). I love you and falling into you are great songs 9.5/10. the rest of the disc is nothing to be too exited about, but still, songs like seduces me, your light and make you happy can't at all be considered fillers. <br /> <br />This cd is just the best cd ever. I have all celine dion albums but none of them come close to this one. Deux, the colour of my love are both great cd's, but nonen of them are as perfect as this album. An absolute must buy!

B000062XFG|4.0|When I wrote that the first season was okay, the second season was much better but still not as good as the show became to be in the third season. They brought in a new doctor, Diana Muldar as Dr. Kate Pulaski. They built a new set, Ten Forward, they introduced the Borg, and Whoopi Goldberg the first major star to appear on TNG as Guinan. Here is some of my favorites in this season. <br /> <br />Where Silence Has Lease <br />Elementary,Dear Data <br />The Schizod Man <br />Loud as a Whisper <br />A Matter Of Honor <br />The Measure Of A Man <br />Time Squared <br />The Icarus Factor <br />Q Who <br />Emissary <br />Peak Performance <br />This season was much better but the show still needed work, but watching this season proves that TNG was headed in the right direction.
B00005JMYI|4.0|i dont know why so many people are sayin this is a bad movie. i thought this was a hilarious movie to start with, but then you have a cast of will ferrell, vince vaughn, ben stiller, and even jack black, how can you go wrong?!? this was clearly will ferrell at his best. i recommend this movie to anybody that has liked snl or will ferrell, hilarious!!!
B0000025BL|1.0|Buyer beware!    This is without question a \\"must have\\" album for every serious rock-and-roll CD library but - omg - do *not* spend even one penny buying the old, original version of this CD unless (1) you already have the 2001 digitally remastered edition and (2) have somehow cultivated a need to know the difference between the two.    The sonics of the original \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\" CD is unlistenably pathetic, brittle, and harsh - most likely due to the use of p**s poor source tapes and equalization intended for producing vinyl LPs - not CDs - a common practice in the 1980s when CDs were rushed to market in order to meet the public's demand for digital versions of its favourite recordings - after all, digital is better, right?  Not necessarily - and *definitely* not in the case of this classic album.    I was *so* glad to finally see this album reissued in digitally remastered form (with 2 bonus tracks) in 2001.  I keep my old, original CD around though as a prime reminder of how far the music industry will go to sell utter (...) at full price to blindly faithful, unsuspecting people every time a new audio technology appears with a reputation of being the best that's ever been.    As for the *music* contained herein, you'll be hard-pressed to find anything better.  ***** (5 stars easy)
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Franz Ferdinand's single \\"Take Me Out\\" has rocketed them to super-stardom thanks to the heavy rotation on MTV and the radio.  They deserve their success, too, for this is more than just another garage rock band.  Franz Ferdinand combines their post-punk new wave influences with 80s/90s dance grooves to come up with their own brand of bizarre, sexual rock 'n' roll.  \\"Take Me Out\\" may be a great, two-parter but there is a lot more to discover on this album.  The opener \\"Jacqueline\\" starts with a barely audible acoustic intro followed by bursts of screeching guitars and deep bass.  \\"Tell Her Tonight\\" sounds like the Beach Boys gone disco to great results, \\"Darts of Pleasure\\" is a passionate song about lust with the right vocal touch and instrumentation to make it work, and \\"Michael\\" is a raving homoerotic dance number that makes you want to get up and shake your ass.  Franz Ferdinand haven't given us the next great rock 'n' roll group but they have given us something stimulating to listen to with some thought behind it instead of the majority of musical rubbish found on the radiowaves today.  Give this CD a listen, even if you think hearing \\"Take Me Out\\" one more time will drive you insane.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This CD has became one of my fav. cds!! Avril's lyrics are so perfect. That girl can write and xpress her self so perfectly!! I can not say enought about this album xcept BUY IT!! It is a must have for any cd collection!! My fav tracls would have to be \\"take me away\\" and \\"forgotton\\" I can not wait for her up coming music!!  <br />(And if you have not checked out \\"Let go\\" by Avril Lavigne that cd is a must as well)
0440237688|5.0|I read this book when I was in middle school, and loved ever minute of it. It is a sad book, about a boy who lives in a black and white world. Of oppressed dreams and desires. Only through the eyes of an old man who knows the reality of life.
B00005JLWN|2.0|I have seen this movie for the second time and, I can say...I have changed my mind about it...  I dont think it is as horrible as I described it the first time, but I still think it's pathetic to have the slogan :\\"FORGET THE MATRIX!\\" In it's cover!  The story is quiet good, and the acting OK, but it took me 2 times to realize this...  I recommend you this movie, but if you have not seen The Matrix trilogy, buy the 3 (The Matrix, Reloaded, Revolutions) now!!!   Dont you ever forget The Matrix!!!!
B0000029DD|5.0|Every once in a while an artist comes along that defies all description and categorization and rises above the chaos vying for our attention in popular music.  That voice is Jeff Buckley!  This cd will change your life.  From the haunting mojo pin and dream brother to the flowing grace to the almost catchy last goodbye to the hymn like corpus christi carol, this cd is bound to move you beyond words.  Pieces of his iconclastic father are inherent in him.  Buckley operates at a level that forces you to confront conflicting emotions that lurk just beneath the surface in all of us but does it in such a way that it makes you comfortable being in that realm of the unknown.  It's hard to describe.  Like a long lost friend forcing you to confront yourself and who you are.  Constantly challenging but never alienating.  A voice like an angel and one that will be greatly missed.  If you buy one cd this year, BUY THIS ONE!  You won't regret it.
B000062XM7|5.0|Definitely a GREAT movie, the Last of the Mohicans, brings to the screen the story of Hawkeye, an American raised among the Mohicans, as he finds himself in love with the daughter of a British military commander and in the midst of the Seven Years War (French and Indian War) in the year 1757.  <br />The film combines romance, drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind! <br />Moreover, the clash between England and France is as fascinating as the conflict between the Mohicans and the Huron, and the tension between the Colonials and the North American British authorities; all are presented very well in the film. <br /> <br />Needless to say, Daniel Day Lewis, Madeleine Stowe, Russell Means, Eric Schweig, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! <br />The actors' great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again. <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the MUSIC, and the costumes are all wonderful! <br />It is a movie definitely worth owning, yet alone watching, especially for those with a soft spot for History and Romance. <br />
B0000026NC|5.0|Having been nurtured on Pink Floyd by my dad when I was growing up in the 80's I appreciate Delicate Sound of Thunder in its entirety. I may have been only 8 yrs old when it was released, but listening to this album remains as a favorite pasttime for me. The CD will never be the same as vinyl, but it'll have to do since I don't have a turntable.  <br />The best version of Another Brick in the Wall to my ears, Comfortably Numb is an incredible jamfest (as is the rest of the album). Sorry to the critical ones, but Delicate Sound is up there with Pulse, Darkside, etc.

0385335482|5.0|Rebecca Bloomwood, a financial journalist for Successful Savings, is ironically, up to her eyeballs in debt. She enjoys frivolous spending and tossing her bills into construction site dumpsters. Realizing she has a spending problem, she holes herself away at her parent's house, trying to escape from the grasp of the bill collectors. While there she finds her financial expertise has backfired. When asked for her 'professional opinion?, Rebecca accidentally steered her neighbors into a costly situation. Trying to make amends for her misguidance, she throws herself into writing a front page story exposing the wrongdoings of a corporate giant, which misled many customers and cost them large sums of money. Her story created such a stir that it landed her on a popular morning television talk show. This gets her to her television debut that she had always fantasized about. This move proves to be the catalyst for some very interesting events.<br /><br />Anybody who enjoys shopping will love this book. It's easy to comiserate with Becky Bloomwood and it is also easy to laugh at her because she gets herself into some interesting situations. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and did not want to put it down. This charming novel will keep you laughing and looking forward to reading the sequels.
B00004TDTO|3.0|Love the movie, always have. But noticed many deleted scenes in the 25th anniversary edition. The locals clashing in the sea going after what they thought was Jaws. Quint upsetting the clarinet player. Those two are the most noticable. I did find that there in the deleted scenes part of the bonus materials. But it doesn't do any good there. <br /> <br />The major part of the story is still there. Just hate to see the movie cut up like that decades after it's been released. I know when I saw it on a television channel it had those scenes. Just thought I'd let everyone know.
0800177177|4.0|As a true fan of the book, I will say that the movie is the closest adaptation around.  However, it is NOT Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\": as found in a book cover.  Rather, it is an adaptation and should be viewed as such.  People who criticize it for taking too much creative license need to realize this. <br /> <br />I will spare you the plot-spoiling fodder and just say that if you like vampires and can ignore the fake British accents of Keanu Reeves and Wynona Ryder (who are bearable), this movie will entertain you.  You have to see it to understand how difficult it is to review this movie.
B000063V8S|5.0|The fourth season of TNG was outstanding, really strong episodes, and strong storylines. I have so many favorites to this season so I will share them with you.    The Best Of Both Worlds part2  Family  Brothers  Remember Me  Reunion  Future Imperfect  Final Mission  Data's Day  The Wounded  Clues  Nth Degree  The Drumhead  Half A Life  The Mind's Eye  Redemption part 1  This was an amazing season, everyone in the cast really got the job done. I would recommend this season and the third, and all the others. TNG is a show that is just simply brilliant
B00006WUWQ|4.0|they need to come out with a new one, I'm getting mad because the last one they came out with so far was in Summer 2002... anyway onto the movies.    Austin Powers:International Man of Mystery - 9/10, I like this one because it was the first & the jokes are really funny, Probably the most crude of the 3 also.    Austin Powers:The Spy who Shagged Me - 7/10, My least favorite of the 3, It just didnt have what the first one did, but Fat (...), & Mini Me were cool.    Austin Powers (in) Goldmember - 10/10, The best & funniest one, Mike Myers plays Goldmember, Goldmember is the funniest charactar from these movies I can remember, The best by far, but they need a fourth one!!! Buy these if you dont have them ( I bought the 3 pack).
B000063DS1|5.0|I forgot how good this concert was. We attended, & we bought the 8-track set. Looks like I need the new CD set. Good music.
B000002ADT|5.0|This album is pure gold. Or should I say, triple platinum. Anyway, despite what a few select reviewers said about having dull and bland music, this album is excellent and holds my attention throughout all the cuts. It covers a wide range of feelings but still maintains a solid overlying blue to it throughout all the charts. The only reason some people reviewed this with less-than-five-star-reviews is because they simply don't have a taste in jazz - they may claim to, but simply said, this album is the greatest piece of work musicians have jammed into a single album. Casual listeners might not be interested it because they simply don't like jazz - it's an aquired taste. But for hardcore jazz musicians like myself, we can appreciate the great music that is jazz and has its pinnacle in Kind of Blue.
B00007ELEL|5.0|I saw this movie the first time with a couple of friends, who have raved about it. I loved this movie from begining to end. The story makes no sense expect for the fact the The Dude(Jeff Bridges) has been mistaken for a millionare with the same name(David Huddleson)he has his rug pissed on by thugs who came to collect on the debt this millionare's young wife Bunny(Tara Reid)owes. Then the film turns into a big P.I movie where he is hired by the Real Lebowski to find his kidnapped Bunny. And along the way, he mets with strange and disturbing people like his two buddies, Walter(John Goodman)and Donny(Steve Busimi). The millionare's feminist daughter(Julliane Moore)A Niehlest(Peter Stormare, a flamboyent bowler(John Turturro)\\"No one F*** with the Jesus\\" A porn mogel(Ben Grazzara) and a old western cowboy who is the narrater of the movie(Sam Elliot) This is a pretty awsome cast, and a pretty awsome movie.
B000002H6C|5.0|Well,what can I say?, this one is a real headbanger, and concerning to the poor quality of sound, you should come to realize that this record is very deep in lots of diferrent aspects, at this time tallica's former bassist Cliff was dead and when they went to the studio to record this album, Hetfield and his crew did what no band could ever do, REAL AUTHENTIC ANGER and of course the seek of LADY JUSTICE who seemed vanished, this strong words and feelings made this album so magic and yet so dark, a mixture of heart and music...yes my friends this is METALLICA not a bunch of 4 who sold up and made a f#\\"%#$ movie thing by now
B000002JR8|5.0|I know there are many people sad about the Ohio's tragedy,and i also know there are many who have written a review of this album already,but i can't help doing it for myself...you know,this is a good way to pay homage to those who were killed,and specially to DIME.The sadness and the feeling of powerlessness cannot be put into words,so i will avoid talking about the events wich took place on that very day,just to talk about music.Firstly,i must say that Pantera delivered always great albums,but this is my fave one,along with Vulgar...The musicianship of all the members of this band and their brutality(or brewtality?What do you think,Zakk?)were awesome and were shown here at top form.Songs like Slaughtered,Becoming,etc prove it.But there's one song here,neither the most powerful,nor the best one ,which stands out,and that is Planet caravan.I know that is a cover song,but is special for many reasons:in my opinion,is even better than the original(Geezer Butler said once that it was the best cover from Sabbath that he had listened to,so imagine...),is a Sabbath song, which is a band Pantera had a lot of things in common with,and above all,Dime's playing on this one is beyond reality.And is a very melancholic one too,so from now on i will always remember Dime by listening to it. <br />This happened more than ten years ago and Pantera were in their best moment.Now all is lost, due such a senseless act,except the music,that will be the best way to remember better times and to pay homage to the memory of those who recently passed away. <br />Thanks everyone!DIME forever.We will miss you! <br />
B000002KFJ|5.0|High level of maturity, differentiated stuff, f***ing riffs, drums, bass, vocals, keybs, everything was perfect. <br />A classical album. My favorite. Brazil-SP.
B000063V8R|5.0|This was the beginning of what TNG was all about, strong characters, great storylines, great acting and overall good writing. I found the start of the season a little weak until the episode, The Bonding, which delt with a child who lost his mother and a alien being who is trying to replace her to make him happy was just wonderful. Then it got rolling. Here is my favorites of the season. <br /> <br />The Survivors <br />The Bonding <br />The Booby Trap <br />The Enemy <br />The Defector <br />Deja Q <br />Yesterday's Enterprise <br />The Offspring <br />Sins Of The Father <br />Tin Man <br />Hollow Pursuits <br />The Most Toys <br />Sarek <br />The Best Of Both Worlds Part 1 <br />This was the start of the TNG we know and love.
B00064MW6A|5.0|Everyone hated Batman II even though it had Michelle Pheifer running around in black leather. So what do the genious minds from Hollywood present us with almost 15 years later? A Cat Woman movie. How unoriginal.<br /><br />Well in the 90's Hollywood's gas tank was on empty, we had a decade of movies made from long dead TV shows (Beverly Hillbillies, Brady Bunch, etc.) We still have it today with Charlie's Angels and Starsky and Hutch. To mix it up a bit, the suits are now presenting us with an endless supply of Marvel Comic Superheros. Spider-Man, good. Hulk, bad. Cat Woman? Bottom of the barrel.<br /><br />The title of this movie could have been \\"Watch Halle Berry run around in a cat-suit, you know you want to\\". That's really about it. I'm not a Halle Berry fan. I don't think she's all that. Maybe she would look better if she wore her hair like a woman.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm rambling. If you are a Halle Fan you will see this no matter what anyone says. If you are a leather fetishest, you will to. So why does anyone bother to review this?
B000002BBY|5.0|Oasis may not get much airplay or press in the states, but that is unfortunate as they are one of the all time best rock bands to come along in the last 25 years! <br /> <br />This is their most solid album they have done. Others are decent or even great, THIS however is perfect from beginning to end. <br /> <br />SONG LISTING: <br /> <br />Hello: A great starter song. Uses a \\"sample\\" of a Gary Glitter song at the end. A great song to start a concert. Hard rocking like most of the album. <br /> <br />Roll With It: Another hard rocker. This is what Oasis does best: Heavy rock and roll that blows you away.  <br /> <br />Wonderwall: Nice ballad, one of their only US hits. If you haven't heard this song, you probably haven't heard any of their songs. <br /> <br />Don't Look Back In Anger: Another US radio hit. YES I KNOW, the piano intro is like Imagine by John Lennon. SO WHAT, if i had a dollar for everyone who stole the beat to We Will Rock You by Queen, i would be a millionaire. so who cares if they lifted it, it is the ONLY part of the song that is \\"copied\\". This is another ballad. This one is sung by Noel Gallagher. He can really sing, sometimes makes me wonder why Liam fights with him, Liam is a great singer but they COULD do without him if they needed to. <br /> <br />Hey Now: A LOUD rock and roll song. One of the best on the album. Good and long too (almost 6 minutes) <br /> <br />Blank: Part of the Swamp Song. Kind of an interlude. annoying this time around as it doesn't connect anything like it does later on... <br /> <br />Some Might Say: Recorded with the drummer from the first album (Tony McCarrol) Obvious as to why he was sacked. He wasn't that great of a drummer. This is the weakest trzck on the album. <br /> <br />Cast No Shadow: Another nice ballad. One of the better ballads on the album. Nice instrumentation.  <br /> <br />She's Electric: kinda hokey. It is a decent song but the lyric \\"She is electric, can i be electric too\\" makes me cringe everytime.<br /> <br />Morning Glory: Another hard rocker. I LOVE THIS SONG! One of the best on the album <br /> <br />Blank: more of the Swamp Song. At least this time it connects Morning Glory and Champagne Supernova together. <br /> <br />Champagne Supernova: An EPIC song. Light AND heavy in the same song. I love the lyric \\"Where were you while we were getting high\\" Great Song! <br /> <br />All in all an album that ALL rock fans MUST own. Once you hear it, it will be in your all time top 10! <br /> <br /> <br />Please read my other reviews and vote on them if you find them helpful!
0312305060|5.0|I've just finished The Hours and have started to read it all over again. What a wonderful book. Brilliantly structured and so delicately conceived that the plots, the women, the moments in time dip in and out and against each other. <br />   It's Cunningham's prose however that lifts it into a category all of its own. These are sentences you can bathe in. He riffs against the original, takes Woolf's turns of phrase and uses them for his own purposes, enlarges and magnifies them. Is there anything, anyone, who can sum up a moment, a memory, so acutely? This is a book that makes you feel cleverer and more humane by the simple act of reading it.  <br />    \\"Maybe there is nothing, ever, that can equal the recollection of having been young together. Maybe it's as simple as that. Richard was the person Clarissa loved at her most optimistic moment. Richard had stood beside her at a pond's edge at dusk, wearing cut-off jeans and rubber sandals. Richard had called her Mrs. Dalloway and they had kissed..... <br />    ...It had seemed like the beginning of happiness, and Clarissa is still sometimes shocked, more than thirty years later to realize that it was happiness; that the entire experience lay in a kiss and a walk, the anticipiation of dinner and a book... <br />    ...What lives undimmed in Clarissa's mind more than three decades later is a kiss at dusk,on a patch of dead grass, and walk around a pond as mosquitoes droned in the darkening air. There is is still that singular perfection, and it's perfect in part because it seemed, at the time, so clearly to promise more. Now she knows: That was the moment, right then. There has been no other.\\" <br />   Wonderful.
B0002X314C|5.0|PRELUDE: John says [Come and go with me/There's something new for you to see]. And judging from the tone and texture of his voice, his claim isn't hard to believe. Somehow those few words effectively set the tone for the entire album. (10) <br /> <br />LET'S GET LIFTED: John's voice on this song just takes control of your ear. He's casting a spell so thick, it's hard to get out. But that's the plan, [Once you take a hit of this/You won't ever want to quit/You'll be so addicted]. He just tempting you with this song. He's daring you to keep listening. The he way he wraps he voice around the words, addicted may be an understatement. (10) <br /> <br />USED TO LOVE YOU: With a hint of sarcasm, slyness, and humor the words [Maybe I should rob somebody/So we could live like Whitney and Bobby/It's probably my fault, my bad, my loss/That you were above cost/And all I could do was love you] are refreshing. You have to feel for the guy because when was the last time you heard someone singing about not being able to afford something? (10) <br /> <br />ALRIGHT:  John puts on his best swagger and cockiness for this song, [Hold up/I know you got a man but I'm tore up/And I don't even care if he rolled up/Wit somethin' to say/You better tell him he don't want it wit me]. He's definitely a ladies man. But what's unique about this song is John's ability to chase after the catchy beats without the richness of his voice fading. (10) <br /> <br />SHE DON'T HAVE TO KNOW: Onto John's softer, smoother, and jazzier side for this song. He not shy about playing up his more  womanizing attributes. [Oh, it's getting crazy/And I don't wanna hurt my baby/And I know it's supposed to be the last time for you and I/But let's no end this way/Let's wait another day]. Judging by a few of these songs, I would guess that's it's kind of hard for John to say no. But he makes this song sound like a love song instead of a cheaters anthem. His voice is so flexible that he could make [I hate you] sound like [Ilove you]. (10) <br /> <br />NUMBER ONE: Hey, John doesn't want you to leave him just because he been around the block a few times. His mentor, Kanye West, makes an appearance on this track and cleverly makes light of the subject. (8) <br /> <br />I CAN CHANGE: Snoop Dogg opens this up with his trademark laidback style and John voice captures the angst and agony masterfully. He's believable when he says, [I see the light now, it's shining through/Gotta give up the game, yeah, I got some changing to do.] The wonderful choral voices accent this song appropriately. (10) <br /> <br />ORDINARY PEOPLE: This is strictly John and the piano. Although, after hearing his version on Jay Leno with a band, I would have liked more instrumentation on the album version. But this sort of things is difficult to do because some singers' voices aren't musical enough to strictly accompany a piano. John's is, so this song is nice to hear in its purest form. (9) <br />  <br />STAY WITH YOU: I think is the most beautiful and endearing song on the album, definitely the most poetic. [As each morning brings the sunrise/And the flowers bloom in spring time/On my lovin' you can rely/I will stay with you]. (10) <br /> <br />LET'S GET LIFTED AGAIN: This is more like an interlude. It's not a complete song. I'm not sure if this interruption was really necessary at this point. (8) <br /> <br />SO HIGH: This one might be a little too conventional and predictable for me. This is the song that seems the most out of place. (8) <br /> <br />REFUGE (WHEN IT'S COLD OUTSIDE): One of John's greatest gifts is his ability to lift your spirit and that really comes through this song. [I prayed for better days to come/Prayed that I would see the sun/Cuz life is so burdensome/ when everyday's a rainy one]. After this song, I get the feeling that if the sun could hear John's voice that it would be shining all the time. It just has that affect on you. (10) <br /> <br />IT DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE: This song is very special because it's John, his piano, and the rest of his family joining him in song. The opening lines are a poignant moment for reflection: [Do you remember/When the family was everything?/Do you remember?/It was so long ago and much has changed/I wanna go back/ Wanna go back to those simple days/I wanna go back/But now we've grown and gone our separate ways]. (10) <br /> <br />LIVE IT UP: The best album closing song I've heard in awhile. With this final track, John Legend's album lives up to the expectations that its title set out to achieve. This is a classic. [Cuz now, everyday is feeling like Friday/I'm getting paid and doing it my way/We're finally on our way/Baby, now it's time to celebrate]. This song is constantly on repeat.(10) <br /> <br />If you're an R&B fan, then this album should not be missed. John Legend is laying down the foundation for something great. <br />
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I am still in shock over how much I enjoyed this movie.  How wrong I was when I thought this would be another of those moronic mediocre movies that SNL alums keep churning out.  Will Farrell wasn't his usual silly over-the-top ham self and that was a pleasant surprise.  I was fully prepared to not like him and his usual slap stick over acting ways.  He won me over as a fan with his in-control acting in this movie.<br /><br />Elf is the perfect movie for the entire family but a single middle-aged woman like me can also enjoy it too.  Elf is the best entertainment and movie I have seen in years.  It now ranks as one of my all time favorite movies.
0316666343|1.0|I am sooooo glad I only borrowed this book, because if I had purchased this I would be really upset. I thought this book was terrible. A great idea but terrible execution. Who wouldn't want to read a book about a murdered girl looking down at the life she left behind? Sounds so mysterious and intriging... but this was awful. It went on and on and on and it was just weird.  <br /> <br />I have nothing else to say beacuse this book was just too bad.
0671027387|3.0|'Deception Point' was my second Dan Brown 'thriller', but because I am somewhat of a masochist when it comes to books, I may yet try one more. Others have already addressed some of my minor complaints - formulaic plot and characters and suspect science. All these I can forgive, it is after all just a work of fiction.  But by claiming a 30 year old F-14 Tomcat can make an unrefueled supersonic dash from Wallops Island to the Ellesmere Island ice shelf in less than two hours, he casts doubt on every other technical claim he makes. He compounds that error with further silliness by attributing the feat to a pair of non-existent Grumman engines. Puullleeeez! This was his first technological marvel and I couldn't believe anything afterward.<br /><br />Having said that, its not a bad book. It is no doubt better than I could muster and probably as good as most contemporary best selling works of fiction. But if any of you readers are would-be writers, and have been daunted by the challenges of writing a work that anyone would bother to read... Take Heart!... Mr. Brown's success should give you hope.<br /><br />And one last thing. I don't claim to know the answer to this, but if the sun doesn't rise in the autumn darkness of Ellesmere Island, what combination of trigonometry and astronomy permits the moon to do it?
B00006LIRI|1.0|fans were ripped off with this one. The cover art is such a beauty...but that's all. A beautiful cover art. <br /> <br />why do we need those crappy \\"new mixes\\" ? Bono and his lads still think Pop is unfinished or whatever... so, so wrong. Pop is perfect as it is. So they wasted 4 songs from this \\"best of\\".  <br /> <br />The hands that pray for America ( new title ) is their worst clich ever. Instant money and U.S charts for them. <br /> <br />Where are Please, The Fly, Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses, etc ? <br /> <br />Ladies and gentlemen: don't get fooled. This is not a \\"best of\\".
B0006TJCZY|5.0|This is a terrific, old fashioned, madcap, screwball comedy. Deftly directed by Howard Hawkes, the pace is frenetic from the get-go and never lets up. Starring Cary Grant, as a straight-laced paleontologist, and Katherine Hepburn, as an impulsive and beautiful heiress, this film is simply about as good as comedy gets.<br /><br />The plot itself is simple. David Huxley (Cary Grant), a noted paleontologist, is trying to get a philanthropical grant of money for his museum from a wealthy donor. In his quest for this charitable gift, he runs into Susan (Katherine Hepburn), who, unbeknownst to him, is the niece and prospective heiress to his potential philanthropist's fortune. Once David meets up with this madcap heiress, his life will never be the same.<br /><br />The film is noted for its highly improbable situations, its rat-a-tat-tat, stacatto delivery of lines, its frenetic pacing, and impeccable comedic timing. Toss in a missing dinosaur bone, a little dog with a fondness for such, a domesticated leopard (if there is such a thing), a not so tame leopard, a great cast and script, and voila, one ends up with a great film!<br /><br />Cary Grant is marvelous as David Huxley, the straight-laced, befuddled man of science who is drawn into improbable situations by Susan. Katherine Hepburn is sensational as Susan, the airhead heiress whose hair-brained ideas just lead to trouble. Of course, Susan falls for David, and the games begin. In addition to Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn, the film has notable performances by Charles Ruggles, as big game hunter Major Applegate, Barry Fitzgerald as the hapless hired hand, Mr. Gogarty, and Walter Catlett, as Slocum, the criminally stupid town constable.<br /><br />It is with good reason that this film made The Entertainment Weekly list of the 100 best comedies ever made. It is an assessment with which I heartily concur. This is a superlative, vintage film that is well worth having in one's personal collection. Bravo!<br /> <br />
0671042858|5.0|All of Stephen Kings book have this affect on me... once i start them I can not put them down. He is such an incredible writer his words just bring you to another world. It's the little details in this book that keep you turning the pages... Unlike most of his other books this one is nice and short so you won't miss to much while you're reading... haha.
B00005ASHM|4.0|Do you ever notice that the so called \\"best\\" and \\"greatest\\" albums like Revolver, Sgt. Peppers and Pet Sounds are all from the same 12 month period? I am sorry, I refuse to believe that the best music ever began and ended in 1966-67. We've had too many VH1 best ever lists clouding our judgement and too many people have bought into pundits who spout and spin because that's what they get paid for. I think a lot of people say an album, be it Pet Sounds, Sgt. Peppers, whatever, is the \\"best\\" because... well, just because and have no idea why beyond the fact it was #1 on some list they saw. <br /> <br />That said. This is a fine album. It sounds amazing especially when you think about the kind of equipment they had back in 1966. The songs are fine poppy, boy meets girl material that get a huge boost from Brian Wilson's tremendous production skill.  <br /> <br />I believe someone wrote that it was sounded like a bunch of greeting card verses. Well I wouldn't go that far but it does seem to reach a certain depth and stop. I could be wrong and I fully expect Beach Boy fanatics to claim that I am not listening to it carefully enough. Maybe, but honestly the album doesn't grab me enough to find another level and that in itself is enough to knock Pet Sounds off any pedastel.
B00004XPPE|5.0|No other movie brings back that terror we felt in those days where the madness of mutually assured destruction was the only thread of assurance we seemed to have.  It may be argued that the possibility of nuclear anihilation has not gone away but we sem to seldom think of it as we did in those days at the height of the cold war.  And never will there be a movie with such a shocking end that leaves you with that terror at what might have been.  It is a masterpiece of dramatic suspense.
B00000FC5H|5.0|All the songs included in this compilation are obvious choices. Anyway, we can't expect better. If you want to start lisntenig to EW&F, go buy this one. You'll be no disappointed.
B000099T2L|4.0|Although some may think that this cd is bad. I think that this is a good cd. It took me a while to get used to it, but after a  while it grew on me. It has a lot of good songs such as Baby Boy, and Crazy in Love, which was my fav song of 2003. I think that Beyonce is a great singer,with good talent. Even though I think that if she comes out with a second cd, maybe it could be better then her recent group effort.
B0006399FS|1.0|Four years ago U2 released one of their worst records. Nobody seemed to notice though, because 'All That You Can't Leave Behind' still sold in staggering numbers. U2 obviously took heed, and have decided why change a bankable formula?  <br /> <br />'How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb' is more of the same. The band's 1990s experimentation makes you think of a completely different outfit, and while some of that was doubtlessly misguided, it still meant that if U2 weren't pioneers, they were at least daring. Now it's all just safe, safe, safe.  <br /> <br />Although it probably packs a punch live, opener and lead single 'Vertigo' is hardly the gargantuan rocker it has been hailed in some quarters. And yet it's still addictive. Unfortunately, most other tracks aren't. 'Crumbs From Your Table' sees Bono set his God-like crusade against world poverty to music, but lyrically it's too blunt. Musically 'One Step Closer' rips off 'Miss Sarajevo', while the glam-ish 'Love and Peace Or Else' is plain irritating.  <br /> <br />Elsewhere there are sporadic flashes of magic, but far too few. And when you consider that Steve Lillywhite, Jacknife Lee, Nellee Hooper, Flood, Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno among others add their input to production duties, you have to wonder whether this was just an exercise in mutual back-slapping. Ok, that's probably too harsh, but when did mediocrity become acceptable?. Over the past three decades they have had some sublime moments, but the law of diminishing returns is a remorseless pursuer.  <br /> <br />
0201633612|4.0|... well, it's over. \\"Patterns\\" have not revolutionized the world. Nor does this book need to be \\"studied\\" for deep insights.    What it seems patterns are actually good for is giving common names to popular solutions to problems, to make them easier to call to mind, and easier to discuss with others. Even this much is overrated. Before the advent of patterns, you could have said \\"callbacks\\" and people would have understood. Now you say \\"the Observer pattern\\".    _Design Patterns_ is none the less valuable, because it is one of those few books that EVERYONE is expected to have read. This is helpful in practice, as you can expect everyone to be familiar with its vocabulary. Few books truly fall into this \\"required reading\\" category. The only other that comes to mind is the MIT algorithms text. Many tech pundits claim that every next book is \\"required reading\\", and the claim becomes tiring after a while, but this is one of the few that really is.    I would not necessarily purchase it, though. The \\"pattern\\" schematic is verbose, and requires pages upon pages to describe something that, once you have seen it in practice once or twice, you will recognize immediately. Omitting the appendixes, the book is barely 350 pages, and presents only 23 patterns. Only a handful of the patterns are truly famous: Singleton, Observer, Template Method ... perhaps a few more. A number of them are poorly presented. Chain of Responsibility, for instance, is just one of many ways to define an event framework and does not belong in a book that doesn't present the alternatives. Mediator is another; there must be dozens of ways to create a Mediator, which most people would call an \\"event registry\\" or something else, rather than a Mediator. \\"Mediator\\" itself is little more than a name, and won't help you in design.    Some patterns are boring, since modern languages tend to provide them, and we've heard about them many times already: Iterator, Proxy, Memento (serialization). Others, like Command, are geared towards GUIs, and provide little value to other types of applications. Then there are the State and Strategy patterns, which are two sides of the same coin, and needn't be given two different names.    And so on. Definitely do not \\"study\\" this book if it seems you \\"just don't get it\\". Chances are the book is wrong. It is worth a read through, and a second read through if the terminology doesn't stick the first time, but stop at that. My gut feeling is that this book is most appropriate for someone working on his or her first large project. After that, once the terminology sinks in, the book has little else to offer. And if taken dogmatically, or considered \\"inspired\\" or infallible, the book is a hindrance. Finally, overuse of patterns can result in a \\"kitchen sink\\" design, instead of a simple one that takes a few patterns, that may or may not be ones from this book, and implements them cleanly. Take the book for what it's worth, but remain skeptical.
B0006A9FMI|3.0|Wait for the &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">MadMan Entertainment&lt;/a> release.  They had representatives, cameramen, journalists, and most importantly, Mamoru Oshii and Mitsuhisa Ishikawa introducing the film, at the Australia premier screening. <br /> <br />As an aside, Madman's release of Akira features the eighties English dub as well as the new dub.  They listen to the fans, and are not subject to the same licensing limitations as the US publishing houses.
0316743003|4.0|Boys enjoy their toys, and Ben Rich had some of the coolest toys around.  How about F-117 stealth fighters and the SR-71 Blackbird for starters?   <br /> <br />Skunkworks tells the story of Ben Rich's time at Lockheed Martin's top-secret design works in California, focusing mainly on their work on the two planes mentioned above.  The storytelling is great, conveying the engineering difficulty and seriousness of what needed to be accomplished without ever losing the impish, boyish delight in getting to \\"play\\" with the equipment with which they worked. <br /> <br />The book moves along great, gives you that behind the scenes feel that can be so fun, and gives you the history of a team that helped cement American superiority in the Cold War.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B0002X314C|2.0|Next time Johnny Boy, <br />Maybe missed somthing but this guy is no Donny Hathaway, Sam Cooke, or whomever you want him to be except another hook singer signed to a album deal.  Kanye West is gonna drain his talent like he drains 1980's soul samples, plus from the flow of the album you can tell that legend didn't have any creative control over the project it sounded like two completely different albums 1-7 then 8-14 (the latter would get 4 stars by its self).  With the exception of \\"Ordinary People\\" and \\"So High\\" you can hang it up.  Bland over discussed song topic, bluejeans and an sportscoat shouldn't get you compared to the neo-soul artist who where doing it before it became trendy.  Besides I'm sick of wishing someone was like Marvin Gaye or Harlod Melvin, Isaac Hayes etc... They were great but this retro phase has taken its toll lets start loving the artist who come out today for what they contribute not who they remind you of.  And maybe we will hear some music thats worth a second listen.
1400032717|3.0|If this book were judged solely on the job Haddon does of capturing for the reader the experience of being autistic, it would be five stars hands-down.  Unfortunately, it feels as if there was so much satisfaction about capturing the voice of the narrator that putting an equal effort into the plot was deemed unnecessary.  There this book falls short of the claims of greatness that so many people lavish on it.    It is understandable that for the autistic protagonist of this story, the accomplishment of some outwardly pedestrian activities would be great triumphs.  That doesn't excuse the writing from its obligation to convey that sense of accomplishment to the reader.  That doesn't happen here; you are left to assume that something big has been accomplished.    Can't say enough good things about the voice in which this story is told, but if you get through 100 pages and wonder where the plot is, you will still be wondering when you finish the book.  Something impressive has been accomplished in the writing of this book, but it lacks basic elements of plot that keep a reader moving through the story and that isn't a tiny flaw.
B0000025C0|4.0|Don't Look Back is my all time favorite Boston single, but the depth of the first album overshadows the album \\"Don't Look Back.\\"  I did enjoy \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\" as well.

0066620996|5.0|This book has lingered at the top of the business book charts for years, and it deserves its spot there.  Collins takes a highly logical approach to his research on how good companies become great companies.  He starts by finding companies hat have actually made the leap, taking off in a way that dramatically outpaces the market and their respective industry.  After isolating these companies, Collins does in-depth research to find out what they have in common with each other, but not with more average firms. <br /> <br />The result of Collins' work are principles that can and do work.  They are not overnight cures and they are not always easy to implement, but who said that becoming great would be easy? <br /> <br />For any manager or leader of an organization, business or otherwise, interested in taking their organization to a whole new level this is mandatory reading.
0671027344|5.0|This is a journey through out a wallflowers perspective and mind. This book is a must read and will hold you till the end. I think that anybody who enjoys reading, even just the littlest bit would love this book. Charlie is a boy who has an odd outlook on life and is very emotional. You would think that it was because that's just how he is. Well let me tell you this boy has reasons for how he is and acts. This book is so good that I would feel confident in recommending it to almost anyone. Charlie will reach out to your heart when he falls in love, has someone fall in love with him and explores his sexuality. He makes great strides to have friends and develop good relationships with his family members. It's a book that you can laugh at out loud towards Charlie's stupidity and then feel bad the next minute. It will hold you because you get wrapped up in the book as if you were in it. There are characters of all sorts and I wouldn't be surprised if you found one to relate to. You can't find a more realistic book about those people who try so hard to fit in. This book is definitely an undiscovered classic. I'd want to call it a thriller, even though it isn't scary. For now lets just stick with an amazing story that will change you for the better. I recommend this book to everyone.
B00005RHGK|3.0|well the 1st half hour anyways. the rest of it ? who knows? . but it was pretty fun
B00028HBKC|1.0|First off, I am a proud conservative Roman Catholic who has been in Catholic school for almost 14 years.  I admire Mel Gibson as a person, particularly for sticking to his religious beliefs so well in the secular Hollywood.  But, no matter how much I like and respect the man, I cannot possibly bring myself to like this movie. <br /> <br />I had to see this movie for my Confirmation class, so a friend and I went together.  As I said, I have been in Catholic school all of my life.  I have studied the medical process of Crucifixion in-depth.  Due to movies, and plays, and Stations of the Cross, I have seen Jesus brutally killed over one hundred different times.  I basically could stage my own Jesus crucifixion if I really wanted, I know what happens so well.  So I will admit I was only anxious to see the movie for the controversial supposed anti-Semitic undertone (I was wondering if it was true; I found none personally)... and Aramaic, which is a sweet language. <br /> <br />How do I put this nicely.  Even when Jesus is being arrested, the unnecessary, non-scriptured violence already is beginning. They push him off of a cliff and he just dangles there!  I almost burst out laughing, it was so ridiculous.  Then there's the symbolism.  Oh my heavens, the symbolism.  It was like The Great Gatsby, the movie, only without the awesome characters, story, and the symbolism was incredibly forced.  Some of it was just gross too.  I'll get more into that later. <br /> <br />Let's not forget the whipping scene... I sat through some of it, went to the bathroom, and then came back and they hadn't even finished with the first weapon!  I am pretty sure that the scripture clearly states that Jesus was whipped 39 times, but, whatever.  I wish that it had been done in like Jesus Christ Superstar with the guitar riff, so at least I could have enjoyed good music.  By the way, The Passion's music sucks.  It's similar to Troy, tries so hard to be disturbing and anguished but just ends up being a grating caterwhaul. <br /> <br />There are some very beautiful scenes in the movie, don't get me wrong, ones that almost made me cry.  These are the non-violent ones, where we flash back to Jesus' life and teachings and stuff that doesn't involve him being covered with blood.  But they are too short-lived.  For example, I've always found one of the most beautiful parts of the Crucifixion to be the part with the good thief.  In the movie, it promises to have that same beauty, and I was awestruck for a moment... then the movie remembered \\"Oh yeah, I'm supposed to be grossing people out\\" and the bad thief got his eye pecked out by a bird.  I kid you not. Therefore, these short, beautiful scenes are too few and far between to redeem the movie, though it's a shame because they were very well-done. <br /> <br />The movie gets you so accustomed to blood that by the time when Jesus is basically all blood and no flesh, you're just \\"...eh.\\"  It desensitizes you.  I was grossed out at first, then I grew used to it.  It also gives you two very pretty people to look at so you're not too offended (Mary Magdelen and the Apostle John)  Just when you think Jesus can't bleed anymore, he does. <br /> <br />Also, the lack of accuracy drove me nuts because the whole point of the movie was to be accurate... that's even why they put it in Aramaic!  For instance, Jesus carried the entire cross and the nails were through his hands.  These have been proven to not be true; the wrists would have been pierced, and he would have just carried the horizontal part of the cross.  Like I said, I wouldn't have cared as much if Gibson hadn't been so proud of his accurate portrayal.  Then again, my medical student brother-in-law told me that no one can bleed that much and survive, so maybe I am giving this movie too much credit.  It figures. <br /> <br />I was NOT religiously touched nor enlightened; is there any person out there who thought that crucifixion was a walk in the park?  If anything, themovie's total attitude was so stifling and had so much self-grandeur that I had to keep from laughing at times.  I mean, it was completely ludicrous.   <br /> <br />When I went to Confirmation class to discuss the movie with my fellow catechumists, I found that I was not alone. Our catechist was very surprised to see that all of us had hated the movie and none of us were at all touched.  A guy from my school summed up how we all felt: \\"They didn't tell us anything about Jesus.  It was like watching a stranger get killed.\\"  I think that's a good way of putting it.  I didn't feel like the person getting maimed was my Lord and Savior.  I mean, lots of people were crucified.  I need to see a little more than that.   <br /> <br />Frankly, it scares me that there are people who bought this movie and will be watching it more than once.  To me, it is hollow and I get more out of hearing the Passion read at Palm Sunday mass, or attending the Holy Week masses like the Easter Vigil, or even listening to Jesus Christ Superstar, which is what I like to do every Good Friday.  Heck, I got more profound religious meaning out of a documentary on the Shroud of Turin than this tripe.
B00068IOWC|1.0|After Pop ( rediscovered recenty by thousands of dissapointed fans ) the band became increasingly conventional. This album just displays something to feed those hysterical, swooning teens who love anything named as \\"U2\\".  <br /> <br />It's an unwritten rule that any new product seem to be \\"the best\\", even for \\"critics\\" like Rolling Stone. But U2 forgot 99% of their fans aren't those children who listen to Jessica Simpson or Beyonce, so we can't swallow the hype alone.  <br /> <br />We were promised a \\"REAL PUNK ROCK ALBUM\\" ( Bono, 2004 ) and that's what seems to be if you take a look at the sleeve. With the cover front alone U2 make fool of fans. That's something censureable. Far from the former \\"three chords and the truth\\" band we discovered by 80's.  <br />What we found was just something we've heard since 2000. AN UNDENIABLE FRAUD.  <br /> <br />Everything was calculated, neverthless they made a big mistake: to take us for granted. Everything they did was wrong. And now they have to carry on with that. Fans don't want to be treated as stupid children anymore. We don't care if they're going to tour, it will be a vocal disaster, and surely it will be a mix between 90's and Elevation Tour. U2 have become a predictable commercial company. Pathetic  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000524CY|4.0|The first time I saw this film on television which was the edited version (before the VCR, DVD and digital cable era) it left me terrified. Damn, this film scared the heebie-jeebies out of me. I must have slept with my mother with the lights and television on every night for at least a week until it drove her crazy. As a kid, I have never seen anything so graphic like that before. 20 years went pass before I was able to watch this movie again and add it to my movie collection.  Though the movie is dated, it is still indeed the scariest movie of the 20th century

B000784WMW|5.0|This is the only version of \\"Jane Eyre\\" I've seen that comes anywhere close to doing justice to the book.  Don't get me wrong, the other versions may be good in their own way, but this is THE version.  The script & the actors are wonderful, and they include much more of Jane's life than has ever appeared in any other film version.  And the clincher:  This appears (based on the run time) to be the *complete* version, not the hacked-up job they released on VHS.  Anyone with the video version needs to throw it in the garbage (okay, recycle it) and order this one -- if you love the story, the cut scenes are more than worth it!
0783114222|5.0|Made by NASA fans Tom Hanks and Ron Howard, this tribute to the space program was obviously made with love and still managed to show the warts.  In particular, the episode showing the strain the program put on the wives of the astronauts (directed by Sally Field) was a good bit of information about the program not widely known.
B00008RH3L|5.0|Gabriel Byrne is the trusted number two to crime boss Albert Finney. But Finney's romantic interest in Byrne's girlfriend (Marcia Gay Harden) causes him to risk his control of the city by protecting the girl's brother (John Turturro) against a rival gang leader (Jon Polito), whose fixed fights Turturro has been chiseling in on. How can Byrne manipulate the situation to keep Finney on top, at the risk of losing his girlfriend and beloved boss ? <br /> <br />Right from the opening scene, this 1990 gangster movie from the Coen Brothers will draw you in with its clever dialogue and brilliant sets. I agree this is the best Coen Brothers film. Every detail and conversation is relevant, and the story builds to an intense climax. Not a single misstep and great pacing - just a superb screenplay and production design all around. <br /> <br />For those of you foolish enough to question Gabriel Byrne's accent, the man really is from Ireland. So if you think he's botching the Irish accent, perhaps you don't know what an Irish accent is supposed to sound like !
B0002I831S|5.0|What many newer fans forget is that in many ways Star Trek (TOS) was a political commentary show.  They were able to touch on subjects that could have never been done on TV at the time, because the censors didn't take SF serious. In addition it was damn good adventure show as well.  Don't forget the mini-skirted uniforms and green exotic women!
B0002GX9IM|4.0|Certainly, it is yet another disaster movie, but we film-goers have a huge appetite for disasters.  The film makers will keep making them as long as we keep paying to watch them.  In my opinion some reviewers have been too harsh about this one.  It's not bad, as disaster movies go.  There are some very good special effects that save it from being the unworthy crock some people are suggesting.<br />In this film, the Northern hemisphere is covered by big, rotating clouds - there are 3 of them: one for Canada/USA, one for Europe and one for Siberia.  The heroes are American (of course) with a nod to a small knot of British climatologists (or meteorologists) shivering over their tea and biscuits in Scotland.  The warnings about possible climate change, brought about by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and hacking and burning forests, had been largely ignored by those in the strongest position to do something about it.  And now it's too late.  The switch to colder global temperatures has been flipped.  The genii is out of the bottle and cannot be put back.  The course of events is inexorable.  The polar ice begins to melt at an alarming rate.  The Atlantic conveyor (the ocean current that carries warm water to the cold regions where it gets all cold and salty so that it sinks and flows back to the warmer regions) is altered when a critical desalination point is reached.  Climate stability is lost.  There are huge storms - unseasonable and in unexpected places.  Great flocks of birds fill the sky over New York - a portent of doom - flying south.  A huge dome of ocean crashes over Manhattan.  Those who survive the drowning are subjected to blizzards and rapid freezing.  Wolves stalk the streets.  People who are able to, flee south, where they find the Mexican border closed to them.  It all looks pretty grim.  There's been a sudden catastrophic climate change and the planet is plunged into a new ice age.<br />The quality of the cinematography and CGI, as good as they are, don't make a good story unnecessary, but they still help the film to be very enjoyable despite a high degree of schmaltz.  The wolves are obviously computer generated (just as well because one of them gets a series of vicious clouts with a torch and a couple of them have bone-crushing collisions with walls and doors) but the flocks of birds and the movement of water, snow and ice are very realistic. The acting and the dialogue are not bad but the human interest element of the story really is a bit sickly.  Now that I've watched the film a few times, I find I just skip all the emotional goo and go straight to the entertaining parts - mostly the special effects.  Examples that impressed and entertained me (the sort of clips they show on the trailers):<br /> the breaking off of the Larsen B Antarctic ice shelf<BR> the rash of tornados tearing Los Angeles apart<BR> the huge wave that crashed over the statue of liberty and into New York<BR> the quick freeze flag<BR> the discovery in the library of a section of publications on tax law that nobody - not even the most devoted bibliophile - would mind burning in order to keep warm<br />There are a few extras.  The commentaries are fairly interesting.  The trailers are useful.  I now know that I want to see \\"I Robot\\" and also \\"Alien vs. Predator\\" looks interesting though we only see the 'creature workshop' and not any part of the film.  The menu programme on this single disc edition is not too good.  If you press the menu button, instead of going back to the menu, as happens with most DVDs, this takes you straight back to the interminable warnings about pirating films and you can't skip them.  So best not to press the menu button if you just wanted to select a different scene for example.  On balance, I think this is an entertaining film and well worth the price.  If you like disaster films, you should enjoy this.
B00005JMYI|3.0|This film suffers from typical SNL movie curse. Trying to make a feature film out of a 10 minute sketch worth of material.<br /><br />I liked it, but it was really too over the top at times.<br /><br />The News Team rumble scene was great though...<br /><br />A very good cast that clearly had more fun making the movie than I did watching it.
B0000025F7|5.0|Michael Jackson may well be one of the most popular artists to have ever graced the pop charts, but even buyers need know that his album releases have a tendency to be inconsistent.  Arguably his greatest creative period, was between 1979-1982.  The beginning of this period, was when he dropped this album \\"Off the Wall\\", that many argue was his finest album (although \\"Thriller\\", was the greater commerical success).  This album with the legendary production of \\"Quincy Jones\\", was to seamlessly mix Pop, Funk, Soul into a firecely chorrent album, that set a new creative high for Pop/Urban albums. <br /> <br />Opening with a pair of Urban-pop tunes (\\"Don't Stop 'Till you get Enough\\" & \\"Rock With You\\") that were as heavily steeped in sophisticated R&B-pop showcase with a definite disco slant, as they are sublimely crafted pop tunes, the remarkably thrilling vocal performances from Michael chime beautifully with the brilliant songwriting, and intoxicating blend of strong melodies. <br /> <br />These were cleverly followed by two resolutely Dancefloor orientated numbers in the shape of \\"Working Day and Night\\" and \\"Get on the Floor\\", that proved to be as vibrant & as colourful tapestry of alluring funk, and thrilling vocalism, by the real secret to there success was the driving and enormously catchy strings, guitar and Disco Beats (courtesy of \\"Quincy Jones\\"), that proved to be the most easily identifiable trademark here....so much so, that both songs are usually recognisable after the first 5-6 seconds of play. <br /> <br />\\"Off the Wall\\" is a dazzling array of Funk guitars, subtle strings and horns, and still to this day remains a rousing and deeply dramatic piece of dance-styled mainstream pop, that definitely ranks among the best uptempo songs ever written.  Again the double contribution of both Michael's gripping vocal performance and the virtually flawless production behind this track, marked this track out the become, not only a lead single, but quite possibly the most popular song of the album. <br /> <br />The production team on this album takes something of a backseat here, as Michael gets to truly express his vocal range, with the stunning ballad that is \\"She's Out of My Life\\", and so proving,  not only be a pop singer of some remarkable distinction, but also able to push his vocal range up several levels and deliver effortlessly skilled ballads.  And also of having the double effect of giving the album enormous diversity. <br /> <br />And along with the remaining tracks, that are all equally worthy of praise, you have not only one of the greatest Pop/rock albums ever made, but arguably one of the greatest albums ever made...period.  There is no Filler on this album, and few could argue against Michael's singing/Vocal performances, which were virtually flawless, and not enough praise is given to Quincy Jones for embuing this album, with such a beautifully orchestrated production, that without either (Michael's singing or Quincy's production), the album just couldn't possibly hope to be the success that it was.  As to whether this album or \\"Thriller\\" is Michael's best album, will continue to be debated, but both of what quite possibly are the finest collection of pop/rock albums ever made, should unquestionably be a part of anyone's collection.
0962477060|5.0|I have been playing guitar off and on for almost 20 years. I have been studying this book for a few months and I got to say I have learned a lot with this approach.  However, I do not think it is the best book for the absolute beginner.  It seems to me your hands should already be in pretty good shape and you have some  knowledge of basic chords and scales.  After that, this book will definitely take you to next level.  I also bought the dvd a couple of months after buying the book and got to say that I enjoy studying it much more while studying both together.  I usually read through the sections in the book to get the concepts down and then watch the corresponding video on the dvd for demonstrations and extra tips and it seems to stick much better than reading the book alone.
B000002WPI|5.0|The band may have all released a bewildering array of solo albums, and possibly weakened the brand with offshoot merchandising, but the group hailing from Staten Island..N,Y dropped this debut, in 1993, that not only completely put East-Coast Rap firmly on the map, but this was a collective of 9 members, with a Shaolin / Martial Art fixation, that put such a ominous & thuggishly confident album together, it still to this day ranks as one of the finest Hardcore Rap albums ever made. <br /> <br />\\"Bring da Ruckus\\" is the sort of street-smart & confrontationally raw track that brought the clan to fame, minimal beats & complex wordplay are the order of the day, and set a running theme throughout the album,  as virtually all the tracks on Enter the Wu-Tang is packed martial arts metaphors, pop culture references, that would take multiple listens to fully digest. <br /> <br />\\"Can it Be All so Simple\\"...leads with a marvellous northern soul sample before breaking into a fusion of strings and horns, and off-kilter menace, (RZA the production genius behind the album, blends a sublime fusion here).  And yet the production is never allowed to overshadow the lyrics, with self-introspection rhymes such as: \\"Yeah, my pops was a fiend, since sixteen Shootin' that (that's that sh***!) in his blood stream\\", meant that this wasn't an album all about needless gun posturing.  <br /> <br />\\"C.R.E.A.M\\"...pushes RZA production to the forefront with menacing minor-key piano, ominous string arrangements and subtle clipped beats underlayed over the whole thing, that remarkably became something of a 'Wu-Tang' trademark, but the tales of money related crime make for thrilling listening, and when this lyric is dropped: \\"But it was just a dream for the teen, who was a fiend Started smokin woolies at sixteen, And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes, Making my way on fire escapes!!\\"...this is as lyrically tight a rap Collective as there has ever been.  <br /> <br />\\"Protect Ya Neck\\"..is arguably my personal favourite, and shows the group in a united stance, with the gorgeous muted Horns, schizophrenic surreal beats, sounding like a brooding soundtrack to a horror film.  And its here, that I feel the interwoven rhymes between the members is at it's most impressive, with each member not only being cerebral storytellers, but lyrical technicians as well, each member having a very distinctive lyrical rhyme passage, on the mic, before handing over the Mic to the next member.  And the track is rounded out perfectly with 'The Genius' (aka \\"GZA\\") stealing the show with this lyrical rites of Passage: \\"First of all, who's your A&R??...A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar??...But he don't know the meaning of dope, When he's lookin for a suit and tie rap, that's cleaner than a bar of soap, And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight...Matter of fact bring out the girls and let's have a mud fight!!!\\". <br /> <br />If you have even a passing interest in either (A) The Wu-Tang Clan, or (B) Hardcore/East Coast Rap, you owe it to yourself to (at the very least), give this album a whirl.  Not only did it set the bar for the majority of rap albums that followed, but it is here, that the Clan not only provided their most impressive performances & (thanks to RZA), often imitated production.  This is truly a landmark album, and one of the (very few) rap albums that ever makes those \\"Best albums ever\\" list, when people lists their favourite ever albums....truly astonishing.
0440238609|5.0|Perfect.  I could have easily read these books back to back but then it would have all ended too quickly so I had to read one, wait a few months and read another.  I have the last chapter left in The Amber Spyglass because I cannot bring myself to finish it. I have not been this enthralled since first reading The Chronicles of Narnia about 20 years ago. I especially love the fact that Mr. Pullman doesn't  portray his female characters in a chauvinistic way as did Mr. C.S. Lewis. Both authors have painted lovely, vivid pictures though. I can't say enough good things about this trilogy.  I find Lyra, Will, Mary, Iorek and other characters and storylines come to mind frequently...it's been years since I so desperately wanted to believe such wonderous people and places could exist. I have encouraged everyone I know to read these books as discussions can be as entertaining as the books themselves. I could easily become fanatical about this set...I disagree with some reviews that a particular book in this trilogy is better than another.  They are equally astounding.  Thanks--
B0006A9FKA|5.0|well what can i say about this? er well it is the funniest film i've seen in years.  the storyline is obvious its about zombies ok easy, its the way they deal with them thats funny, there are some fantastic visual and physical comedy as well as some verbal gems. <br /> <br />the characters are really well written, but the one who steals the show is Ed, he is without a doubt the biggest pratt, but you want him as your best mate.  the more i watch this film the funnier it gets.  <br /> <br />this is resident evil, but with an English twist. do your self a favour buy it you'll regret it if you don't.        <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002DB52M|2.0|Lars Von Trier's \\"Dogville\\" is \\"Our Town\\" for the clinically depressed, exploring the dark underbelly of rural Americana in ways that Thornton Wilder never even imagined.  Like Wilder, Von Trier utilizes a fictional small town to reveal profound truths about human nature, although Von Trier`s revelations are far more sinister and despairing than any Wilder came up with.<br /><br />Dogville is a sleepy little hamlet nestled high up in the Colorado Rockies.  The simple folk there lead lives of humdrum monotony, undisturbed by the troubles and vicissitudes of the outside world.  One day, a mysterious and beautiful young woman - allegorically named Grace - is found wandering in the town.  When it is discovered that she is fleeing some mobsters, the townspeople reluctantly agree to hide her and let her become a member of their community.  At first all goes well, with Grace winning over the hearts of the citizens and even bringing a measure of previously unknown joy into their lives.  However, slowly the mood turns sinister, as the denizens begin to exploit, then sexually and psychologically abuse the delicate young woman.  Von Trier makes the case that even the most seemingly benign, mild-mannered individual will, if given half a chance, lord it over someone who is weaker and more vulnerable than he is.  The final hour of the film has much of the feel of Shirley Jackson's \\"The Lottery,\\" as Grace becomes the expiatory sacrifice for the sinful folk who live in the town - until, that is, the tables are turned on them.<br /><br />Because the story is essentially a morality play and a parable, Von Trier has chosen to make the film on a stark soundstage, with chalk lines substituting for walls and only the barest minimum of d&eacute;cor suggesting an actual town.  Only the sound effects - such as the opening and closing of invisible doors - is entirely realistic.  (A TV movie version of \\"Our Town\\" in the 1970's utilized this same technique).<br /><br />Although, as a conceit, \\"Dogville\\" is intriguing enough in its early stages, after about the first hour or so - and it runs for almost three! - the movie begins to severely outstay its welcome.  Once the novelty of the stage-bound approach wears off, we are left with a pretty silly story in which the characters act in ways that are not merely inscrutable but downright maddening.  We begin to wonder what the point of it all is after awhile.  If Von Trier is trying to say that small town Americana is really not all Norman Rockwell sweetness-and-light, that theme has been explored countless times before, and in works far less contrived and pretentious than this one.  The tone of self-importance that permeates the film is reflected in the dividing up of the tale into nine \\"chapters\\" - replete with fancy title cards - and the use of a droning, hoity-toity narrator (more shades of \\"Our Town\\") whose main function seems to be to point out the obvious.<br /><br />As Grace, Nicole Kidman does an effective job portraying an essentially passive victim, although we spend most of our time wanting to see her deck all those sadistic idiots with whom she comes into daily contact.  The other actors are fine as well, though such stalwarts as Phillip Baker Hall and the ageless Lauren Bacall are left hanging around in the background with not a whole lot to do.<br /><br />\\"Dogville\\" is, I suppose, an audacious attempt at something different, and for that at least it should get some credit.  But I doubt that most people will have the patience to see it through to the end./>Although, as a conceit, \\"Dogville\\" is intriguing enough in its early stages, after about the first hour or so - and it runs for almost three! - the movie begins to severely outstay its welcome.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|yeah, all i really have to say about this movie is that it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i really wish i could give it 0 stars but that wasn't a possibility. i did not laugh the whole time. only people with sick senses of humor that think they are better than napoleon will even give a slight giggle at this piece of trash.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I put this on my wishlist for the holidays based only on the fact that it had so many positive reviews.  My strategy has been to trust the general consensus of those who present well-reasoned opinions and it was upheld with this gem of a series!<br /><br />I don't remember this premiering at all on Fox, but then again I don't follow an awful lot of television shows, period.  While I was a little dubious about the \\"science fiction\\" plus \\"western\\" combination, they really manage to pull it off.  The characters are interesting, the acting well-done, and the writing was very good (not to mention witty) for this short-lived series.  I was sincerely disappointed that there weren't more episodes and that the story line ended where it did--the possibilities were endless and the potential was huge.<br /><br />This series earned another fan and I recommend this DVD offering for all of those looking for an entertaining sci-fi \\"light\\" diversion.  Fun stuff.
B00069L0XG|4.0|i have to agree that in some fight scenes, the camera was a little racy and i got dizzy. overall, i did not like the direction. but i can't let the camera angles make me give this a bad rating. it is one of the best zombie movies and one of the best video game movies ever made. and Milla Jovovich is the hottest girl alive
B0002Y69NG|5.0|There is a lot of information here and Matrix fans will love this box set.  The featurettes provide extra insight into the developement, planning, and execution of all the Matrix movies.  It almost feels like you're on the inside of the set getting to hear the secrets that no one else can hear.  Most interesting is getting to hear from the stars themselves; what they were thinking or feeling about a particular scene or action shot as well as seeing the Wachowski brothers act out what they envision should happen in a scene.  It may be information overload for some but I think most fans will eat it up. <br /> <br />For those who do not have the game, Enter the Matrix puts together all of the live action shots in one place and watching these will help explain some things that were not explained in the movie such as: what took place with Captain Niobe and Commander Locke before she volunteers to look for Morpheus' ship and; why the Oracle looked different (even though we know it was because Gloria Foster died unexpectedly) in The Matrix Revolutions. <br /> <br />There is an extensive look into the Merovingian's chateau and where the ideas for it came from.  We also get to hear more from Wu Ping as he teaches the cast the martial arts basics as well as the casts frustration in trying to perfect their performances.  Tere are moments during an interview with one of the principle cast members when you can see another cast member practicing their martial arts moves in the background.  There is plenty of good background information in this set.  The highway chase scene was pretty well covered in the original extras but there is even more here.  <br /> <br />By the way, all of the movies are included just in case you were wondering.  You'll need at least a week to disect it all.    If you really want to take the red pill, you must have this set.  There is much too much information here to comment on.  It's worth the price just to have it as a collector's item.  Trust me, downthe road this set may bring a pretty penny especially if unopened. <br /> <br />It still may not be enough for those who are never satisfied but this box set should come extremely close to it.  Free your mind.  Buy it now!!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|My fave Radiohead album. The songs are beautiful and indulgent and we are the richer. The spirit voice of Thom Yorke might be lost on the aggitated and distracted masses, but there are those of us that make time to enjoy evolving intangible. <br />    Amazing palette of guitar tones are here...jagged to murmuring and otherworldly.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Hello my name Is Tony and here is what I think of Michael Moores's Fahrenheit 9/11. <br /> <br />I still have the ticket stub in my pocket and remember sitting in the theater mesmerized by what I was being told about Bush about the War.... And as I left the theater I felt Angry and also ashamed, ashamed that I had known nothing about any of this period!  <br /> <br />The day after seeing this movie I started watching CNN; I started carrying more about what my government was doing and how they did \\"business.\\" <br /> <br />I have three friends in the military; two are in the navy-one in the air force. When they had leave and were home to visit. I sat them each down and showed them this movie. Well to say the least they didn't care for it at all. (Personally, I'm just glad they watched the whole thing). They were after all the perfect candidates for the military. They got crap grades in high school, they never got jobs so they just blew there savings, and really like shooting things (seriously).  <br /> <br />Later on while we were watching T.V. A GO NAVY commercial came on and all three admitted that if they were sent to Iraq they wouldn't re-enlist and just take what ever jobs they could when they got home. <br /> <br />Now on to Michaels film. Personally I don't see Bush as a criminal mastermind (Dick Cheney maybe) I see bush more as a puppet. Now on to the part of the film that I loved \\"The War On Terror.\\"  <br /> <br />The fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction and the fact that were stealing there oil basically proves.....yes we are in this war for all the wrong and greedy reasons. Don't think I'm some ANTI-War idiot I think that the people in Iraq did need help. But, all we did is make things worse for them. <br /> <br />Thank You <br /> <br />P.S. <br />Keep up the good work Michael. <br />
0671027387|2.0|A true disappointment.<br /><br />I purchased this book after reading the DaVinci Code. The premise (from what I read on the book jacket) seemed intriguing, however, after 1/4 way into the book, I felt disappointed and it only got worse as I read on.<br /><br />The book began with an interesting premise, but seemed to quickly lose focus. What I assumed would be an intellectual drama combining science fact interwoven with conjecture and story line (Similair to DaVinci Code) became something else entirely.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it seems the author become so engrossed in spinning his tale, that he lost sight of the line between plausibile reality and extremely far-fetched fiction.<br /><br />Perhaps as a military officer/pilot, I hold too high an expectation for accuracy when a writer describes the use of military hardware, equipment and operations. Yet I do recognise that some civilan writers may not have a full grasp of military technology and try to make allowances. However, if a 'serious' writer is going to feature the said technology in his books, he should be somewhat accurate.<br /><br />Additionally, the story itself is just too incredible for believability. The author adds so many implausible aspects that it becomes too outrageous and silly for even the most open minded. One or two implausible items, and one might swallow it. But to string them together, is simply too much. James Bond is more believeable.<br /><br />Instead of a serious novel, the outright implausible storyline puts this book in the fantasy/sci-fi genre and makes it one I would not recommend.
B00005JLH2|1.0|this has the stench of MTV all over it.the taget audience will gobble this up while those with a dots worth of intelligence will quickly dismiss.yeah,i guess its a harmless''feel good,raise the,Da,roof''type movie.i would like to compare this to other movies of the same genre but none are so paint by the numbers like this one.marching bands,cheerleaders,coaches,all things school related......these are topics best served for saturday afternoon viewing at 30 minute increments.g0d bless target audiences.
B0002TSZK6|5.0|As some other reviewers have accurately stated, this movie is banned on all military bases.  AAFES is not allowed to show it at any base.  I work for the Air Force, and I sent an inquiry to the Base Newspaper asking why it was not shown.  An email came back (supposedly from the base commander through the Public Affairs Officer) stating that DoD will not take any political stand, and, therefore, would not show it.  I saw the movie at home, and Moore does not make an endorsement of any candidate or political party.  This movie does not pull any punches but shows things in a factual manner (such as old man Bush being wined and dined by Saudi royalty).  Bought it for my dad for Christmas.  The old man loved it.  If you want to know the truth, beg, borrow, or buy it.  If you love the good ol' Texas cowboy right wing zealot, then don't waste your time and money.
1577314808|5.0|(a comment, not a book report) <br />I came upon this book rather unintentionally. I was not seeking a spiritual answer; I didn't even think I was ready for all that nonsense. But after the insistence of a dear friend who wanted to share a thought with me regarding the book, I read a portion of it. And then I realized I came upon a true gem... It is the book that has had the most profound impact on me, and because of that I write this entry, my first one ever. <br />Eckhart Tolle reminds us not to \\"think\\" about what he is saying, but to \\"know\\" it as truth. If his words innately resonate with you, you will understand. If not, you won't.  If you come upon this book or probably any other with a critical mind, wondering at every point.. do I agree? do I believe this to be so or not?.. you will find all the criticisms you seek. Funny enough I don't think this book will resonate with those that have read a compilation of \\"spiritual\\" books. In any case, I think that if you cannot relate on a spiritual level, it at least offers up some practical comments.  <br />I have listened to the audio book many times now, and each time I understand more and more. I become more and more aware. There is such beauty. His words are not something to \\"believe\\" in. They are just signposts.. to point you towards your own path. You must choose to be ready.. no one can knock it into your head.  <br />
B000067IZ3|5.0|Loved the camera techniques - from hand-held to longshots, the audience becomes completely involved in the characters' situations. This movie is one to focus on while watching - the dialogue is swift, and the spanish government/drug lords can get confusing. (Maybe I was just slow..) Benicio Del Toro, Don Cheadle, Topher Grace, Erika Christensen, and Michael Douglas were excellent.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina is the best!! she has such a great voice it's so incredible, I love her music! when the cd came out I didn't think it was going to be good but then I heard clips and I started to like her she is soo cool! her music says a good message she lets' her voice do her job and like wow Christina you rock!! it's just incredible how her voice sounds in the music!! oh man I listen to it like everyday since I have got it now I am like obbesed with Christina I never knew her music rocked like this, from old days to today Christina will always rock, when she is a nice girl to a dirty girl!!! I don't care how she looks, she is always going to be Beautiful and I am a fan for life!! Luv ya Christina :D P.S. YOU ROCK!!!!!!!!!!
B0001L3LUE|5.0|If you are thinking about staying home this weekend and want to watch a film that gets you thinking, then Errol Morris' Fog of War is your best bet.  Winner of the 2003 Academy Award for best Documentary Feature, Fog of War documents Robert McNamara, U.S. Secretary of State under Kennedy and Johnson, and his recollection of everything from his tenure as President of Ford Motors, to his involvement, as an advisor, in the foreign policy and subsequent standoff of the Cuban Missile Crisis.   <br />  <br />Fog of War uses archival and interview footage with McNamara to explain the eleven lessons he learned from his time working as Secretary of State.  His political savvy is captured onscreen as he brings the viewers up to speed on some of the historical decisions he helped foster, the results to which saw him become the President of the World Bank. <br />  <br />With the final Presidential Debate taking place this Friday, Fog of War acts as a reminder of the importance of past political decisions in a more comprehensive and constructive way thank Michael Moore is capable of.
B000001FMC|4.0|Oddly, I'm just discovering this CD, and at first spin, the sound strikes me as an updated Friends of Distinction -- y'know, that smooth pop group from the early '70's whose hits \\"Grazin' in the Grass\\" and \\"Love or Let Me Be Lonely\\" still rightfully ride the oldies-but-goodies waves -- coupled with hints of the more recent sultry jazziness of Sade.  Sure, the lyrics on this disc are not exactly memorable, but with this effervescent, upbeat, mostly easy-on-the-ears, melodic groove, what's not to like?  I'm ridin' with it just fine...
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Jared Hess' Napoleon Dynamite is, without question, the sleeper comedy of the year.  Influenced by Wes Anderson's \\"Rushmore\\" and Paul Feig's \\"Freaks and Geeks\\", Napoleon Dynamite is a study in isolation that clearly distances itself from the two.  Napoleon, played by newcomer Jon Herder, is a quirky geek from rural Idaho who, like many before him within the genre, has problems relating to others.  His obvious disregard for the way in which others view him, including the audience, isolates him further.  The fact is that Napoleon Dynamite is a character study that never actually studies a character. <br /> <br />It nestles itself within the genre of alienated teen comedy by taking 85 minutes to deliver and repeat a one liner.  Situations present themselves whereby Napoleon is put on the spot.  His obvious disregard for how others receive his words deliver the joke, as there are no consequences for his action.  Things here stay stagnant, a journey that takes us nowhere except to the realization that we are laughing out loud, situation after situation.   <br />What distinguishes this film from others within the genre is that there is no revenge from this nerd; there isn't even any change in his disposition.  Rather, Jared Hess takes us through a week in the life of a geek leading up to the prom.  The anxiety pertaining to this, as seen in so many other films, is totally underdeveloped, which works.        <br /> <br />To suggest that Napoleon is comfortable with the way he handles himself is an understatement, but i guess that is fitting since this film is a total understatement.  Despite being the center of attention, he does not allow a possible error in judgment to affect him. The audience laughs at him the same way his onscreen peers laugh at him. Napoleon remains unshaken, it truly doesn't stir him.    <br /> <br />Napoleon Dynamite is a comedy that is quirky enough to keep you entertained from start to finish, even though you end up in exactly the same place.
B000683VI4|5.0|I absolutely love to read any of Nicholas Sparks' books, and I have read just about all of them as far as I know.  But, this one is by far and away, the best of his work.  Now, onto the movie...I loved how the people of Hollywood stayed very true to Sparks' book 'A Walk To Remember' (see my review for that too), and was pleased to see that they did the same for this movie for the most part as well.  Without giving away the ending for those of you who haven't seen it, Hollywood left no room for following The Notebook with it's sequel 'The Wedding' at some later point in time.  I was very impressed with how they brought these characters to the screen, and how they seemed to be jumping right off the page.  This is DEFINITLY a tear-jerker, even if you have read the book.  I saw it twice in the theatre with two different groups of friends, and was SOBBING at the end of both showings...and passing out Kleenex to everyone around me.  A definite must see and will be gleefully added to my DVD collection the day it hits shelves!
B0006A9FMI|3.0|Sheesh, the film's subtitles are identical to the theatrical release last summer.  Nothing added or removed.  It's possible the written [sound effects] style is sort of infracamp, like the old Batman Pow Zap Ka-Boom visuals, but way more sly -- they're meant to help Americans understand the film, after all.  In fact, the movie feels as though it were assembled by a committee, with every subcommittee effort maxed out and very little central guidance.  Only the visuals really shine -- the graphic art is intense.  The writing is bizarre, pretentious and gauthic, umlauts included.  Finally, what all the surreal soliloquys boil down to is a kind of Daumer-esque disappointment, a vivisectionist's brooding on missing soul and undetectable essences.  As sequels go, this one completely lost the thread of Major Kusanagi's long dark night of the stroll [sic, sic, sic] through nocturnal Hong Kong.
0441003257|5.0|I bought this book a day and a half ago on a completel whim. I'd heard others gush about it, so when I saw it on the shelf of Barnes and Noble, I just figured, why not? <br /> <br />Oh Go-, Sa-, Whoever, am I glad I did. <br /> <br />This book is not only funny, it's intricate and intriguing. I couldn't put it down and finished the 360-some pages in under 24 hours. Good Omens has the comedy of The Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy but, in my opinion, it has something more. I ... well I don't really know what. <br /> <br />Mainly, we start, more or less, on the coming of the Apocalyspe. The angel Aziraphale and the demon Crowley, who should be great enemies, and have been, really, for 6000, which has lead to a pretty tight friendship, are overseeing that all goes well. The Antichrist is born, and will be raised until he is eleven years old, and then the world will end. Sounds fun. <br /> <br />Thing is, at the hospital run by the Chattering Nuns, there's been a slight mix up. As in, the Antichrist and a completely normal, blonde hair little boy who will unforunately be given the  name Warlock.  <br /> <br />So, eleven years later, the end of the world is coming closer and close, War, Famine, Pollution and Death have come, nuclear waste has gone missing, Agnes Nutter was one hell of an intelligent woman, Dog starts liking being a dog, it's mere days until the complete destruction of the world, and no one knows where the Antichrist is. <br /> <br />And, to make matters worse, Aziraphale and Crowley don't actually want the world to end. They rather like it, with it's humans, and Best of Queen albums.  <br /> <br />What happens next? Well you'll have to read to find out! <br /> <br />This book is amazing, hilarious, seriously engaging, and so, so interesting, that I couldn't possibly reccommend to you a better book. Get out and buy this book NOW!
B000000WZ4|3.0|Half of this album is very good, a mixture of dark, sublime sounds, good lyrics, and haunting tableaux.  This half consists of The Love Thieves, Home, Sister of Night, Freestate, The Bottom Line, and Insight.  Each of these songs is an arresting vignette- Sister of Night sounds like a post-apocalyptic search for warmth in the arms of another, while The Love Thieves embellishes the daily struggle to make something of one's self.<br /><br />However, the other half is either filler (two instrumental tracks, three if you count the hidden track at the end?), or leftover refuse from Songs of Faith and Devotion.  What is Barrel of a Gun, if not a reprise of I Feel You?  Useless is okay, but the single version reins in a bit that fuzzy, garage-band guitar riff that agitates.  And It's No Good, which isn't Songs of Faith and Devotion leftover, is just a reprise of their late-eighties sound.<br /><br />Program the first set of songs I mentioned, and you have a spectacular album.  Forget about the rest.
0375759174|4.0|If you have not read Jane Austen before, don't start with this book! (Start with perhaps Pride and Prejudice or Emma.)  <br /> <br />Northanger Abbey was her earliest written novel, but it did not get published until after she died. This book is meant to be a parody. She is making fun of some of other gothic books that were in circulation at that time. The main character gets a little too obsessed with gothic novel reading, and imagines a sinister plot in the abbey becasue her imagination is out of control.  <br /> <br />This book is much more juvenille than Austen's other books. I  felt like I was reading something for teenagers. (Austen's other books have more depth and maturity to them.)   <br /> <br />However, it was an enjoyable, easy read... and as an Austen fan, I wanted to read Austen's earliest work.
B00005OM4N|5.0|When I first listened to this album, I was definitely in love. Every single song seemed to jive together well and it is definitely one of the most listenable in my 125+ cd collection even today, years after I first bought it. From the beginning rhythmic pulses of Slave to the rockish \\"what it's like to be me\\" at the end, this is definitely some of Britney's finest.  <br /> <br />I notice a lot of you are in here unnecessarily bashing this album and I think that the word should be brought out that there is an organization that basically has people just bash all Britney's music so that it will keep selling, and they use writing reviews on this website as a tool. Go here to check it out yourself: [...] <br /> <br />I think it is really wrong to start bashing a persons music to no end simply because you do not like the artist.
0553296981|5.0|Unlike many others, I somehow never had to read this book in school. So I read it as an adult.  This powerful book is the personal diary of a 13 year old girl who was in hiding in an attic (for 2 years) during the Holocaust.<br /><br />If you are in Amsterdam you can visit the attic that they hid in - it is now a museum. I toured it, and what shocked me was how very small the area was that they all lived in...(The diary described their small living quarters, but it didn't seem real to me until I saw it for myself.)  As per Anne's diary, it was very challenging and frustrating for a group of people to live in such close quarters. They had to be quiet and still during the day (when other people were in the building), but at night they could move around a little more freely.<br /><br />I also visited Bergen Belsen in Germany - the concentration camp where Anne and her sister died. There is a special memorial to them there.<br /><br />Anne was just a young girl and parts of her diary are about silly \\"young girl stuff\\"...And parts are a little dull because it is just about the everyday routine of life in the attic. But, overall it is an exceptional first-person account of what it was like to be Jews in hiding during WWII. As you read, you can relate to Anne's fears, struggles, hopes and dreams...dreams that were never fulfilled because of the horror of the Holocaust. I recommend this book to students and adults alike.
1878424432|5.0|A dear friend gave me this book.  I had glanced at it numerous times over the past couple of years, yet never bought it, thinking it was probably just \\"another one of those books\\".  But, it ISN'T your typical \\"feel good\\" book.  This book explains WHY I have been depressed for much of my life. Why I haven't been able to develop a meaningful relationship. WHY I have allowed others to influence how I feel about myself. This book is a definite LIFE SAVER.  I have just finished reading it - highlighting it - writing down passages from it.  It has already given me courage and strength to make my life the way I have always wanted it to be... full of unconditional love, happiness, health.  I have already recommended this book to SEVERAL people. I have thanked my friend profusely for giving me this book.. only 4 days ago!!  I am going to buy the cassette so I can listen to it at night as I go to sleep and at work.  This is an amazing book for me.  I hope it will help EVERYONE as much as it has already helped me.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|People like this movie for the same reason that they like Donnie Darko, because they feel like they should. If you've seen a movie like American Beauty, Adaptation, Rushmore, or The Royal Tennenbaums, you can see an example of a somewhat true change of characters, and not a half-baked people for people who want to dig existentialism or the like. I feel like i'm hitting this movie as harder than I should, but I don't like people raving about this movie when i've seen a lot like it a lot better done way before it.
0790731452|3.0|\\"Mars Attacks\\" was probably meant to be Tim Burton's ultimate tribute to the grade-Z sci-fi flicks of the 50's (he'd already done the \\"Ed Wood bio-pic\\")  Using CGI and a big-name cast, Burton adapted the old trading-card series for a big-budget movie set in present day, but having that same 50's goofiness of the Wood movies - the idiot peacenik scientists (\\"The Thing\\"), goofy media types (\\"War of the Worlds\\"), warmongering generals and the honest joes who end up having to save the world from them as well as the Martians.  Though claiming to come in peace, the CGI Martians make their warlike intentions (and their technological superiority) clear almost immediately (luckily for us wiping out a joint session of congress at the time).  Our feckless president (Jack Nicolson) struggles to confront the Martians without handing his trigger-happy generals an excuse to start lobbing nukes.  Martin Short plays a presidential aide who chases skirt all day long (he has the keys to the White House's \\"Kennedy Swinging Room\\") only to meet his match in a hottie Martian assassin played by Burton fixture Lisa Marie.  Sarah Jessica Parker plays a ditzier version of Carrie Bradshaw, edging out her serious-journalist boyfriend for a scoop of the Martians' landing.  Unfortunately the mix of high-end movie-making and hokey movie-scripting haven't produced a movie that even equals the sum of its parts.  The jokes are pretty bald, the script entirely devoid of subtext, and the characters seldom more than one note (Nicholson playing both the dumb chief and a greedy Vegas developer; Joe Don Baker as a white-trash survivalist ready to blast any Martian that messes with his trailer; Pierce Brosnan as a pipe-smoking intellectual ready to give peace a chance; Annette Bening as a flaky new-ager; and Rod Steiger as a General in the Curt Lemay, Hawk-in-chief mold).  A spectacular opening credits scene (in which waves of flying saucers encircle earth to the tune of Danny Elfman's Bernard-Herrman-themed score) does little more than remind you how much talent and effort went into such an unentertaining movie.
0821221841|4.0|This is a book well suited for people who are looking to become very serious in the photography field. There's chapters on subjects from visualization to camera adjustments. It discusses the good and the bad that come along with many different types of cameras like small, medium, and large format cameras. It shares advice and techniques on how to create the best images with the camera you are using.  <br />          The information is very accurate and detailed. Every subject is discussed with great depth. I think that the diagrams and pictures that are provided also aid in a full and complete understanding of the different subjects discussed. Also, the book should probably be read along with the 2 other books that follow it in the series, allowing you to get the  complete view into photography. Although I personally have never really been very into photography this book actually inspired me to maybe someday really getting into it.
0066620996|5.0|Once in a great while a book comes along that is an instant classic.  The kind of book that will be read and re-read, underlined and dog-eared.  The kind of book that will still have fresh, relevant advice to offer 15 years from now when it is read once again.  Good to Great is one of those books.  Whether you read it cover to cover, or topic by topic, you're destined to find something useful that can be adopted Monday morning in your office.
B0006399FS|1.0|What can do groups do when the beat craze is over ?  \\"Back to our roots\\" that means mainstream. U2 have nothing else to prove and that's clear with this swindle. A musical background, a speaking product.    This album is a reunion drinks for the dollar bills.   How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb has gone into my junk box. This album is a repetition of what they've done since they decided to sold out by 2000. Materialist, conformist, cynic and frivolous, as fans whom like it.    U2 are the album, do you know what I mean ? music has nothing to do with it. Mainstream bloody mainstream. An aberration.    What's next ?...\\"U2 to tour !!!\\"...\\"U2 won Grammy for the album of the year !!!\\"...\\"HTDAAB has been voted as the album of the year by Rolling Stone !!!\\"...\\"their new live DVD !!!\\"...    Go and listen to Pop, Zooropa and Achtung Baby instead
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I have not seen the show, so I can only speak to the cast album, but I have to say this is a show I have thoroughly enjoyed.  It does not have the intellectual challenge of, say, a Sondheim show, but it gives you memorable melodies and snappy, inventive lyrics that play across a wide range of emotions.  I teach choral music, and I have used the album to introduce my students to \\"new\\" Broadway- they love it!  Highlights for me include: What is this feeling?, Dancing Through Life, Popular, For Good, and the amazing Defying Gravity.  I would love to see the show in person someday, but until then, the cast album is a lovely treat.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|After hearing about the mormon film movement last year and had a little bit of a laugh like everyone else, but after this I feel compelled to check out some more. First of all, stories aren't that important to me because they are all the same. What makes a good film is engaging characters, interesting behaviour and captivating dialogue. Naploleon Dynamite is such a funny and memorable film. The characters are well developed and the overall quirky nature of the film works perfectly. The soundtrack is awsome and Jon Heder deserves an oscar if he isn't really like that. They should consider turning this into a T.V series.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|I'm glad I didn't go out and buy this DVD, as I don't think I was too impressed with it. So I'd highly recommend to buy only if you're interested in this kind of movie - rent otherwise, or borrow from a friend.<br /><br />I'm not the biggest fan of Brad Pitt or Orlando Bloom - I prefer my guys who are a bit rough around the edges, whereas these two are a bit too pretty for my liking. I know, I must be the only girl in the world who doesn't fantasise about Brad Pitt. With all the publicity though, I'm definitely looking forward to Mr & Mrs Smith!<br /><br />What I found most annoying about this movie, and many other movies similar to it, is how they're all trying to be the next Lord Of The Rings (according to my Dad, as I still haven't seen those movies, and at the moment, have no wish to). Also, was it just me, or were the main stars constantly posing?! It got on my nerves after a while!<br /><br />I think I'd probably heard of Troy, Achilles & the Iliad through school, although I can't remember reading it. The whole Achilles myth/legend was very familiar to me - where he can be killed through his heel, after his mum dipped him in something, but held him by his heel.<br /><br />This is a butt-numbing 156 minutes long, and could have easily been shortened, and made it pass quicker. The battle scenes are very cliched, and we've seen them a zillion times before. You don't know which army you want to win - with Braveheart (for example), you knew you wanted the Scots to win. With this, it's very confusing. Look out for Brian Cox (he's in everything!) and James Cosmo (?), who was in Braveheart also. You felt no sympathy for any of the characters - although I must admit Hector (Eric Bana) made me very sad towards the end. (Without ruining it for anyone!) You know something's wrong with the film, when you're laughing at the death scenes, and making up things that the cast are saying (BOO!) as they're lying on the funeral pyre. However, I did love the funeral scenes, especially with the focus on the coins on the eyes, to pay the ferryman - this was a terrific tradition.<br /><br />This film can be liked or hated. With the severe lack of decent eye candy, instead of posing pretty boys, I'm sitting on the fence with this film. It's too long (although I can sit through Titanic perfectly), and it doesn't hold your attention for long enough. I was always looking for an excuse to pause it. It's definitely not something I'd ever watch again.

B00005JNLY|3.0|Skimming through these reviews, the general consensus seems to be that this film is about culture clash and sacrifice. This is true, but if there is one major theme in this film, it is INSECURITY. The most obvious is Leoni's character. All of her actions stem from her insecure nature. Sandlers character has fears of living up to what he knows he capable of. The housekeeper has concerns about her place as a mother figure, which is clearly illustrated when she tries to keep with Leoni on her run. The grandmother drowns her demons with alcohol and the daughter has issues about her weight thrust upon her by her mother. The only reason Leoni's character is the vilain in this film, is that she is unable to control her low self esteem thus effecting the lives others.
0385510454|5.0|This book is very satisfying, suspenseful, and full of intrigue. The description of Bologna was woven into the storyline and was not tedious at all, but inviting. Long days drinking expresso, great conversation in Italian, long, leisurely days there sound wonderful to me.  <br /> <br />The story is well written and suspenseful. It kept me going when I should of been studying for my statistics test. It has everything you look for in a novel; informative, intrigue, interesting characters, conflict, rising tension, and  a great climax. Just a great book.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|The movie was great I was loving it. <br />Up to the ending. <br />Warning: Spolier <br />It just killed the movie when all of a sudden when you least expect it, trinty dies in a crash (the most unlikeley death in the matrix universe) and next thing you know, neo with her. <br />And the sun over the city is NOT how the ending shouldve been. <br />Goodmovie, HORRIBLE EDNING WHICH RUINED THE MOVIE.
B00025ETIW|5.0|The first time I heard or should I say saw the the band on Trl on MTV. The music video I thought was a movie trailer but afterwards I relized it was a music video but I was in aw. I recommend this to anyone who like catchy choruses with an up-beat sound.  The band played live on MTV and was awesome. If your lucky and love greenday they will be the opening act. Heck if it was a movie trailer I would have to go see that movie.For the guys that say its not punk if you go to your nearest fye store in the mall its filed under punk and nirvana is grunge or what not.
B00005JLR2|5.0|I know that this movie was Disney's biggest financial loss but we don't care.  I loved Treasure Island as a child and this remake with a sci-fi twist is intersting and visually stunning.  Great music along with the spectacular animation and the remake of a classic story makes this a 5 star movie in our home.
0783231202|4.0|I find it interesting to read the negative reviews offered by critics who fault the movie for distorting history.  Some of these bash the movie for giving too much credit to the Africans and African Americans (through Cinque and the fictional Joadson character) and too little to white abolitionists.  Others bash the movie for casting the Africans as too passive, as helpless victims rescued by noble and brilliant white activists.<br /><br />I myself prefer historical films be as accurate as possible.  But I accept that some artistic license and fictionalization must be taken to make this a drama rather than a documentary.  As a drama, then, it seems from the divided opinions of the historically minded critics that Spielberg has struck at least a rough balance; that is, he doesn't seem to have gone to such an extreme in his personal interpretation and retelling of the events as to provoke a unanimous response from (self-proclaimed) period experts.<br /><br />My own opinion is that the movie works well, as long as it is taken as a point of departure rather than a final word.  I think its value lies in raising questions, outlining issues and sparking the imagination.  Any intelligent viewer will sense and suspect that things weren't exactly as portrayed in the film (the slave ships probably did not play emotional, epic music in their cargo holds and it shouldn't be too hard to understand that the crew dancing with their female captives on deck is a PG representation of rape).  And if some viewers are spurred to look at the case more closely, so much the better.<br /><br />The film is well crafted, even if a bit stark/simplistic, and raises important questions even if some of them are contrived.ns even if some of them are contrived.
B0002858YS|4.0|Though you can find bits and pieces of the 80s, Bowe, The Beatles, and Queen in the music--it is orginal by today's standards. The first time I listened to this Cd was similar to the first time I listened to \\"Elephunt\\" by The White Stripes--I knew I had struck gold. \\"All these things that I've done\\" sent chills up my spine. The song is truly refreshing. In a VERY boring time in music, this was a breath of fresh air. If you happen to be a brit-rock, Jet, or White Stripes fan or you're just sick manufactured music...you must own this CD.
B00005JKZ3|3.0|Being a fan of the first MIB movie, I was excited to see MIB II.  While the movie was OK, I was still quite disappointed.<br /><br />While MIB was a fairly original movie, MIB II is a regurgitated version of the original.  In MIB II, Agent J (Will Smith) is now the overzealous agent of MIB.  The evil alien Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) is scouring the earth for the Light of Zartha, which is not even supposed to be on the planet.  Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) is the only person who has the pieces to the puzzle, but he is now a \\"neutral\\" after being neurolized at the end of the first movie.  The remainder of the movie is a race to see who finds the light of Zartha first.<br /><br />Just as with the first movie, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are an excellent pair.  However, the movie has a weak story line.  This is compounded by the fact that I could not take Lara Flynn Boyle seriously as a villain.  However, I think the biggest problem is that the plot behind the first MIB does not allow the writers to create a sequel with an original plot.  It seems to me that MIB II was just an attempt to capitalize on the momentum created by MIB I.  In my opinion, the acting was \\"flat\\", it seemed to lack enthusiasm (but that is just my opinion).<br /><br />This is a movie that I would recommend renting instead of buying.  While this movie is OK, it is not a movie that I'd recommend going out of your way to see.  If you are a fan of MIB, this movie is not a complete waste of time.

037571412X|3.0|This is Philip Roth at his worse. Roth is one of the great American novelists, and one of the great comic geniuses of the form. I am reluctant to criticize his work because I know how good he can be. Over the past four decades he has produced a formidable body of work, and more importantly a few works at the highest level. But here the seventy year old cocker Kepesh's lust seems somehow ugly and mean. The whole tone of the work is low . The selfishness of the hero and his sexual adventures do not rescue him from being very dull. It is the kind of work which one feels guilty about reading  afterwards.
B000667GFK|5.0|..  First and foremost, Luis Miguel is mexican, raised in Mxico, formed as an artist in Mxico, mexican by own choice also.    I never really appreciated LM's music until I listened his boleros from Agustin Lara, Manzanero, Jose Alfredo, although I always knew his voice is absolutely powerful and unique, but with this one the more I listen the more I like his deeds.....    Luis Miguel has no \\"boricuan\\" roots , in that case he could have more italian or spanish roots, but Luis Miguel was born in P. Rico by accident and never lived or wanted to live there....     Now, going back to my review, This lbum is a total  masterpiece, performing songs from the best mexican composer like \\"Un Mundo Raro\\" and \\"Paloma Querida\\" From Jose A. Jimenez (another true mexican), or  \\"Que Seas Feliz\\" from 'the great' Consuelo Velzquez (mexican) among Many others this lbum takes Luis Miguel to a higher level. From pop singer to Bolero singer and now A true legend that will remain in Mxico's heart for good. On behalf the mexican people from Guadalajara, Congratulations .....Cheers Luis Miguel!! and keep up your style , not too much talking and a lot of singing!!! From your countryman fellows.    To the person who wrote the review about \\"Boricuan Roots\\" the lbum title says \\"Mexico In The Skin\\" that means roots are 'mexican roots' and there will never be even a \\"Puerto Rico In My Documents\\" absolutely never. On your comment saying \\"this album proves that LM is a very versatile artist\\" cut it off please , as any mexican, or any Latin american with a bit of cultural aknowledge would know, \\"La msica ranchera\\" is one of the most beautiful styles, rythms and ways of expression in America, amongst Tango, Bolero, Casino (a.k.a. Salsa) etc. This album only proves Luis Miguel as a mexican paying tribute to his culture, to the great mexican music scene confirming Luis Miguel has an exquisite taste on the songs he will sing next, with which he finally got to this sort of music and the high levelhis voice demands.
B000002GK1|5.0|This is another grunge essential. It's brutal metal mixed with punk rock, and it's a masterpiece. My favorite song has to be \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\". It's brutal and intense, which is how grunge was meant to be. \\"Slaves and Bulldozers\\" has one of the best bass lines crafted, while \\"Rusty Cage\\" and \\"Outshined\\" are classics.<br /><br />\\"Superunknown\\" is as good, but a little mellower. \\"Down On The Upside\\" is mediocre, but \\"Louder Than Love\\" and \\"Ultramega OK\\" are also grunge classics.<br /><br />Don't even bother with \\"Audioslave\\".
B00005JNEW|5.0|Great atmosphere (kind of dark and surreal at times), excellent soundtrack, intense story, Billy Bob Thornton, and HARD hitting action makes this one the best football movies I have seen. <br /> <br />I need not address the plot, as it has been covered. I have not read the book as alot of reviewers have so are better qualified to discuss the story, but what I can do is make comparisons. <br /> <br />As dark and intense as Any Given Sunday, but as one reveiwer had written 'not as self righteous'. It has more focused storyline than the meandering plots of The Program and Varsity Blues that wanted to make sure they packed love and romance into the story.  <br />None of the feel good fluff in Remember the Titans, and no stupid idiocy displayed in The Replacements. <br /> <br />If I had to own one Football flick I would have to say Friday Night Lights just barely beats out Any Given Sunday, but does not outrank Rudy, my all time favorite. None the less I am glad I bought this one rather than renting as I will be watching it again.
B000002NAK|5.0|I have never been a fan of the Material Girl but a fan of Evita so I just had to see this.  I expected to hate it.  Instead, I bought the CD on the way out from returning the DVD rental(bought that too.)<br /><br />Madonna and Banderas were both at their peak in this movie.  If you had not seen the play, you would never notice that they had to adjust the octave for her.  At that moment, she WAS Evita.  Banderas was excellent as Che, but he was no Mandy Patinkin...adding softness to a role that Patinkin had made a bit more (realistically) bitter.  The two Ches truly compliment each other, coming to the role with very different viewpoints. (In fact, I own both the Original American Recording as well as this one and will play them back to back.)<br /><br />Jonathan Pryce as Juan Peron also adds his touch to a role, making me want to cry with him when he learns his wife will die and that he in fact truly loves her. Jimmy Nail has a limited role but takes full advantage of it.<br /><br />Buy the CD, but rent the DVD at least once to get visuals on \\"Waltz of Eva and Che\\".  You won't regret the image of Che and Eva dancing around, instead of with, each other when you listen to the music in the future.
0553274503|4.0|Flowers For Algernon is a very emotional book. I am not a real emotional person, but I liked this book about a mentally handicapped man trying to become smarter. It uses a unique format, journal-like, making it from his point of view. A cool thing is, him being dumb, he misspells the words. <br /> I liked this book because it was fun to see the man's progress. It was interesting to see how people reacted to him; it really changes your point of view of those people! The book is nice because it shows his emotions from his own view. <br /> There are a few down sides to this book. One is in the middle of the book. He begins writing down the actual dialogue, which confuses you, `cause most journals don't have written dialogue. Also, all the misspelled words get confusing, but it makes sense having them. The final downside is the lack of description. This book would be better if it had more, but since it's a journal from a mental guy's point of view, I understand. <br /> All in all, I would recommend reading this book. It's only 218 pages, so it's a quick read, though the font's small. It gives a good view of a mentally handicapped person's life, because it's from his point of view. I give this book 4 stars and believe anyone who wants to know about that, should read this!  <br />
B00008977N|2.0|I am a musician and my first choice in having any gig I wanted would be Peter Gabriel.  I first bought the 2 CD set which I found astounding.  Then, a couple of years later, I bought the VHS and was floored.  I recently bought this DVD and was extremely disappointed.  What I was hoping for was the exact same performance on DVD that was on my wornout VHS cassette.  What I got was an approach of \\"more is always better\\".  The DVD has been enhanced with guitar overdubs and remixing. The visual portion of the DVD isn't very good quality either.  If I knew then what I know now, I would search for another copy of the VHS tape.
0440234743|5.0|The Testament by John Grisham is one of the funniest and well written books I have ever read. It is about a brilliant, rich old man named Troy who writes his will to give billions of dollars to an unknown heir, Rachel Lane. The plot thickens when it is discovered that she is a missionary in the jungles of Brazil. While a lawyer is sent to hunt her down, Troy's other relatives are engaged in a fiery legal battle to win back what they believe is rightfully theirs. <br /> In this book, Grisham had the perfect balance of emotion, humor, and suspense to keep me riveted right until the end. The ending was a total surprise, which was a pleasant change from most other books that I read. My favorite aspect of The Testament was the various personalities of the supposedly \\"rightful\\" heirs. They were all so different and colorful, and had rich and amusing histories. Though this isn't hard reading, there are times when you need to think back a few chapters to appreciate the story's full meaning. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading about legal matters, intricate storylines, or just wants a witty book to sit down with.
0140386335|3.0|I liked the movie so I read the book.  The book is strange and philosophical and much less concrete than the movie.  For now I'm going to chalk it up to being some German thing. <br /> <br />The story follows Bastian, an awkward bookworm of about 11.  He visits a book store and finds a book called, \\"The Neverending Story\\"  He knows that he must have the book and so he steals it and locks himself into the attic of his school to hide from the law and read.  The story he is reading is printed in red and green, just like the book we are reading.  Gradually Bastian notices that characters in the story react to things he does and realizes that the fate of the fictional (or not so fictional) world he is reading about hangs on his actions.  This is the first half of the book.  It plays with breaking the fourth wall. <br /> <br />In the second half of the world the fourth wall is broken.  Bastian is in the world of ideas.  He can trade memories for wishes that come true as he wishes them.  So this explores identity.  The world of Fantastica is like a medieval painting.  Gargoyles etc come from here and there.  Anywhere you look archetypes are playing out morals and ideas.  But when you step back and look at the whole picture you see that there are only these small thoughts and scenes.  Anyone of them is more planned out than is the picture as a whole.  This didn't work for me in book form.  By the end of the book I didn't care what happened to any of the characters. <br /> <br />I think that the approach here is very much a love it, hate it one.  I don't even know that you would know if the book is for you from reading the first few chapters.  For me monotony set in about a third of the way through.  It is very tenuous and has philosophical aspirations.  If you saw the movie and liked it, that is no guarantee of liking the book.  My recommendation is to read this only if someone who knows you has pointed you toward it.
0451169514|4.0|Stephen King's It is about seven kids battling an evil monster in Maine during 1958. Years later, they come back as adults, unsure of whether they killed It. All the characters have their own experiences with the monster, which helps you understand their personalities more thoroughly. The book builds up tension for the apocalyptic ending with details. Some of these seemed boring and unnecessary, but most kept the plot line interesting. This was probably due to the oddness of the side stories, such as a plastic statue of Paul Bunyan attacking one kid and another kid sitting in a torture chair at the police station. <br /> One thing I particularly enjoyed about the book was the five interludes. Each tells a part of Derry's history having to do with It. They give you background information which helps explain why certain things happen. An example of this is how It blew up a factory called Kitchener Ironworks and later a character named Mike met It for the first time in the building's ruins.  <br /> I enjoyed It because it was an interesting, detailed book. It's also a very different book. There aren't many novels out there that are about a childhood nightmare coming true.  <br />
B0006HC0I2|5.0|A wonderful movie - romantic desolation, Gabin at his best. <br />Gripping, ironic, tragic - the film is more interested in its people than its plot. (Easy to see this as the work of a Renoir apprentice). But all the other reviewers below have covered all <br />that. The point is the disc: Criterion and Rialto continue to raise the bar for making old B&W 1:37 films look and sound great on disc. They start 2005 off with a bang on this one: pin-sharp, lovely contrast, a superb grain texture, the mono track rendered cleanly and clearly without brittleness. The extras - interviews and documentaries from French TV programs - are especially illuminating. A wonderful disc of an essential film. <br />It certainly bodes well for a great year from Criterion!
0142000655|5.0|Steinbeck, John. East of Eden. Canada: Viking, 1952. 602 pages.  <br /> <br />East of Eden is one of Steinbeck's greatest works of literature. It is a book about the good and evil of the world and how the human race has the freedom of choice between the two. The story takes place from the end of the civil war to the end of World War 1. The setting ranges from a small Connecticut town to the Salinas valley in California. One of the most interesting things about this book is the author incorporates his on family history into the story line and characters. East of Eden has a straight forward theme on the fact that \\" All novels, all poetry, are built on the never-ending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me (the author) that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal. Vice has always a new fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is.\\" This is one of my most favorite books to date, and I highly recommend it too anyone who enjoys Steinbeck books or is new to him.
B00000DFSK|4.0|<br />Well, first of all: to all those freaks whom think this sold out U2 2000 is \\"back to their roots\\", you must listen to this seriously. Is there any Bad, any With or Without You, any Sunday Bloody Sunday, any All I Want Is You in their 2000 commercials ?... do I have to say the word ? <br /> <br />Ok, let's go to the compilation. It's fairly good, really...but it lacks something: it's just 65 minutes long. So they could have put 2 more songs on it !!!. <br /> <br />Which songs could have been ?. A hard question, but I think they should have put Gloria ( because there's nothing from October here, except the hidden track after All I Want Is You ) and probably a Joshua Tree one as One Tree Hill, Running To Stand Still or In God's Country.  <br /> <br />It's a good compilation anyway, far better than the spoiled \\"best of\\" 1990 - 2000. <br /> <br />If you're a casual fan, start with this one plus Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby, Zooropa and Pop. Don't even listen to U2 2000, don't waste your time. Also don't buy The best of 1990 - 2000.
B000286S8S|1.0|The album is okay except for short versions but the ending of the song Finish What You Started was terrible. <br /> <br />The song doesn't fade out like on the original album  it just ends suddenly, what kind of crap is that?   <br /> <br />I like to hear full versions, so beware don't buy this because the people who put it together didn't care so why support poor editing!
B000001F3C|5.0|<br />THIS IS THE REAL RAW U2 !!!!. You should take note of this. The most known song from this amazing masterpiece - Sunday Bloody Sunday - WASN'T A SINGLE. That's the real music's spirit. In those days U2 had something to say, they had energy, power, angry, hopes, emotions, fears, etc and all those feelings were put in an outstanding document of music. Unlike the sold out U2 2000, this is a must have experience. Songs like Drowning Man or Surrender are just out-of-body. Bono didn't need stupid marketing, didn't need to say \\"is our best album\\" and all that crap, he just needed to say some words he has forgotten in recent years: THE TRUTH. <br /> <br />This album blow away all that marketing machine they've been using badly. Which U2 I prefer ? the iPod one or this one ?... <br /> <br />HOW LONG TO SING THIS SONG <br /> <br />
0780619951|5.0|The vehemence of some of the many negative reviews intrigues me. I loved the original Burt Lancaster version years ago, and found this one better to my tastes. The acting and direction is just right, IMO, *for this particular story.* It is not a happy tale.<br /><br />My guess is that the negativity here is partly or mainly the result of subconscious rejection of the quite disturbing plot and realistic portrayals. Winston's \\"makeup\\" is marvelous. It goes to the core of what is it to be a human animal versus all the other beasts. If you liked \\"Artificial Intelligence,\\" check this one out also. Rent both versions, this and the Lancaster one, and judge for yourself.
B000001FA4|4.0|<br />This album is a sample of the REAL classic U2 - not the sold out one they want you to believe by putting the same cocktail of trademarked sounds once again -.  <br /> <br />A sort Of Homecoming is an experience for me. Without doubt, one of my top 10 U2 songs. Then, a TRULY classic: Pride ( in the name of love ). Everyone have listen this song, so it's not worth to talk about it, simply a great song. For all those freaks whom think this U2 2000 is \\"classic\\" or whatever, LISTEN TO BONO'S VOICE !!!! WHAT A RANGE HE HAD IN THOSE DAYS !!!! not this raspy one who \\"likes the sound of his own voice\\" ( what a crap !!! ). The Edge was innovative in those days ( unlike nowadays ), as well Adam and Larry. <br />Bad is a TRULY anthem. Promenade includes one of the top 10 Bono's performances. <br />Elvis Presley and America is an amazing musical journey, I don't what do you think, but every time I listen to it I'm listening a pretty Zoo Tv times in it !!! OUTSTANDING.  <br /> <br />Finally this album contains the most beautiful - not boring, I'm not talking about Grace or Yahweh - ending ever: MLK. It's an amazing effect if you listen to this song and then you put Joshua Tree on the first track ( Where The Streets Have No Name ). <br /> <br />Why 4 stars ? I really don't know why they included that filler instrumental number called 4th of July. Also I don't like so much Indian Summer Sky. The rest is fantastic. <br /> <br />Highly recomended

B000002LGW|5.0|I WAS AT THIS CONCERT!!!  It was the absolute best concert I ever went to and I get chills when I listen to this cd because one of those screams in the crowd is me.  If you love DM this is something you must have in your collection whether you were at the concert or not.  Dave Gahan has the most incredible stage presence and a voice to die for.  If I were on a deserted island and allowed 1 cd this would be it.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|I loved this album.  I love their previous two albums.  The difference is that \\"Absolution\\" sounds over-produced.  It is overproduced.

6305508550|5.0|The year was 1999.  I was working as a customer service representative in an office that looked eerily like the one in this movie.  You know, one of those utterly bland suburban campuses.  Our company had just hired \\"efficiency consultants\\" to \\"analyze\\" the business.  Then one day a bunch of people get laid off.  While there, management introduced a new phone system for tracking how we spent our time.  We actually had to enter a code to use the bathroom so they could know how much time we were there.   <br /> <br />I remember sitting in the movie theater, not sure whether I should laugh or cry.  Now 5 years later I can definitely laugh.  I love the bit about the TPS report memo and the red stapler.  Lots of rough language, but otherwise a real gem.
1570427496|5.0|I didn't know what to expect as I started reading \\"a walk to remember\\".  I had seen the movie, but since it was on network TV, and therefore,  probably not complete, I decided to read the book and let it stand on its own merits.  Hearing Nicholas Sparks read it made it that much more of a treat!<br /><br />I've read some deep, even profound books in my time, but none that touched me in the way this book did.  It takes a special book to make me cry, and this book is the first to do it.  Seeing Landon's transformation was an awesome thing to behold because it was wonderfully written.  Reading this book, and because a good friend saw the movie of \\"the notebook\\", I want to read more of Nicholas' books, and I eagerly await the chance to do just that.<br /><br />Oh, by the way?  All the other reviewers who have said you'll need Kleenex are right...have a box handy wherever you read this book!!  I can't recommend it highly enough...even five stars doesn't do it justice!

Snap Judjment Syndrome seems to be a far-reaching disease, affecting at least half the population.  #####  How about the other half?  Yes, it seems to be split out.  On what I consider to be major matters I flip to the other extreme, giving in to inferential analysis.  I can close my eyes and see a bulletin board full of little thumb-tacked notes to myself, each adding or subtracting something from what I should or should not be doing.   #####  This book seems to fill a void of sorts--pulling the extremes together.  It teaches how to avoid such everyday dogma as leaps of faith, marshalling flashbacks without selectively sanitized nostalgia, awaiting last-minute arrival of the cavalry.  ##### Overall, Gladwell's admonitions are cogent, and yes, with practice, I would think, applicable.  I only wish he'd delved more deeply into the procrastination side of the \\"think\\" problem, the only slight \\"short side\\" of an otherwise splendid book.

B00005JNEW|3.0|As football movies go, Friday Night Lights is like all the rest. It is based on a true story although I am sure there is some creative license here and there. The plot is fairly predictable and the actors all seem to deliver their lines with the passion you would expect. Thornton seems miscast in this movie, the same way he did in The Alamo, but Tim McGraw does a good job of playing a balding alcoholic father. I guess now we know why he always wears that cowboy hat. I also don't understand why Hollywood has to keep making the world seem that all that matters in Texas is football and not education. We do learn how to read and write in our schools too and not everyone's town shuts down in time for kickoff on Friday night. Other than that, there isn't much more to talk about with this movie. It has some good hard hitting scenes during the football games, but never goes too much into any of the characters. Some of the players, who have speaking roles, leave you wondering who they are supposed to be in the movie instead of caring why they are saying what they said. Thornton needs a hit and seems to be taking any part that he thinks will get him that box office draw. Again, it isn't a bad movie, but it sure has been done time and time again. Thornton's coach seems like a weak version of Denzel Washington's coach in Remember the Titans. At times, he yells at the players just to turn around and seem like the only reason he yelled is because the script told him to do it. Oh well, it isn't as bad as Varsity Blues but it isn't North Dallas 40 or the Longest Yard. Here's hoping for next football season to bring some better football movies.
B0002Z0EYA|2.0|Right off the bat, I enjoy Brad Pitt as an actor (especially in Ocean's 11/12), but not in this film.  While the film itself is well produced and acted, Pitt just wasn't right for the role.  Yes, he looks the part with his rippling muscles, but Achilles (Pitt) is waaaay too introspective and conflicted as a killing machine for the army.   <br /> <br />Perhaps he was like this because he was rumored to be partly parented by a god/goddess, but still, Pitt was out of place in Troy.  Also, Pitt's delivery of his lines was less than desirable.  Through all his muddled emotions he comes off as if he could give a hoot about what he's talking about.   <br /> <br />The action was done well and Eric Bana did a much better job of acting (maybe he and PItt should have switched roles) - the battle between Hector (Bana) and Achilles (Pitt) was especially good.   <br /> <br />I'm only going to mention Orlando Bloom once:  He looked like an utter fruitcake in this film.  I understand that was in part to his character, but come on!  What's up with that late 80's era Michael Jackson hair he was sporting?  Bad choice, much like Colin Farrell's locks in Alexander.   <br /> <br />Wolfgang Petersen was the right director for the action portion, but not for the drama.   <br /> <br />Troy is probably a bearable rental.  But rent it for $0.99 at the grocery store or so you don't feel so bad after it's over.  Not worth much more than that.

B0006A9FKA|4.0|I saw trailers for this film on the internet before it was release and couldn't wait to see it.....ON DVD.  No one would ever want to come see the film in the theater, so I made all my friends watch it with me when it was thankfully released on DVD.  <br /> <br /> <br />When the film began I had fairly low expectations, figuring I'd just wasted $20 - but was I wrong?!  Yes!  Shaun of the Dead is the epitome of British humor - self effacing, subtle, and hilarious!   <br /> <br />Just a quick note:  If you think that SOTD is going to be an all out gore-fest, you're mistaken.  There are a handful of 'bloody' instances but they are quite brief.  There are some shocking (scary) moments but it isn't all that scary simply because the film takes place in the DAYTIME, which in itself is rather amusing.   <br /> <br />In short, SOTD is a zombie horror romantic comedy.  Several snippets you will need to rewind because of the occassionally thick British accents, but keep an ear out for the subtle humor.   <br /> <br />Make sure you watch the extras, too - it will answer some questions you may have during the film.   <br /> <br />Enjoy!  See you at the Winchester (you'll get the Winchester reference after you see the movie)!

B000002ADT|5.0|This collection of songs by Miles Davis will stand the test of time as the best jazz album ever. Not only for its excellent musicianship by the players but by its enjoy-ability. This album is so fun to listen to. It always soothes my soul. When my daughter was a newborn and would get fussy at night, then I would put this album on at a pretty good volume. By the start of the second song, she was calm and relaxed. I took a jazz history college course, and my professor raved about this album. At first I was skeptical, but I later understood his excitement. I have this album in my iPod, and it tends to be the most played album.
1592400876|4.0|Ms. Truss's new book is truly a wonder and a pleasure simultaneously!  She has succeeded in writing a book about Grammar, that is actually pleasurable to read, in fact, truly delightful to read; and still includes all the grammatical essentials specific to \\"Punctuation.\\"  Ms. Truss concentrates on the use and misuse of punctuation in everyday life.   <br /> <br />Once she points out the horrific state of the English language, she goes on to state the correct rules for usage of every single punctuation mark extant in the language today; and some commentary about extinct punctuation as well.  Her prose and examples are truly amusing and educational.  And her choice of first person writing style allows her character to shine through every page. <br /> <br />She concludes by saying that some of the \\"rules\\" are in fact conventions, that are argued about continuously as the language evolves.  And to show she is hip as well, she devotes a charming final chapter to the use of `Cyberspeak' or `Netspeak,' including 'emoticons,' and some of her anticipated prognostications on the effect this will have on the evolution of language into the future. <br /> <br />This truly is a writers' book, presented with great care and precision, in such a way, that it becomes a book for all who wish to learn, as Ms. Truss would put it; \\"The correct manner in which to use an apostrophe!\\" <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|Never thought I'd say this of a U2 album... this is truly a TURD. Embarrasingly simple-minded and boring, uninspired... just dreadful. What happened?<br /><br />Oh, how the mighty fall.  They've gone full circle from influencing Coldplay to being influenced BY and sounding like Coldplay.  And that just isn't a good thing in my book.
0596007124|5.0|I bought several other books on design patterns and frameworks, they all went straight over my head, the explanations were all way to complicated and written by pointed headed professors for pointed headed professors, this book explains it in a fun easy to learn matter..
B00000055E|4.0|This album is good, but not Pac's best. This album is probably worth getting. It's the kind of album that some people like and some people don't.
B00004U2G4|4.0|I think this is a great album and the sound quality is good throughout except on the song \\"Ol' Man River\\" (which by the way I think was brilliant despite the many objections people have to the song). Ol' Man River is screwed up for about half a minute from about 1:20 from the end of the song to about 50 seconds till the end right as Jeff Beck comes in with the electric guitar. The imperfection (which is similar to the sound a damaged record makes when played [scracthy noises]) is irritating and it seems like Bruce Dickinson would've done something about it. Anything...but no. I've checked around and this problem is on every Truth remastered album. I'm going to pick up the LP to see if it's on the original.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I love this collection and think it is wonderful to have the hits that reached #1 on the charts come together on one CD.  I cannot understand the vitriol and angst expressed in other reviews of reissuing this collection.  This is a stellar collection that will certainly be listened to and enjoyed time and again.  Putting the hits in chronological order is a good way for people becoming familiar with the Fabs to trace and track their musical progress.  For inveterate fans like me, this is just a bonus treat.  Any excuse to listen to the Beatles works for me.<br /><br />I have two copies of this CD - one for the home CD player and one for in the car.  You never know when you might get a Paul Mac Attack and need your Beatle fix!  Avid Beatle fans like me will certainly find this one delightful and it's always good to have back up copies of your favorite songs!
B00005M91K|4.0|I first saw Baraka in a theater shortly after its release and I have been mesmerized by this film ever since.  Until recently, I had been watching the original DVD release on a small television for years.  I have now made the jump to a Sony 57-inch widescreen.  After attempting to watch the original version on my new big screen, I simply could not put off purchasing the Collector's Edition any longer. <br /> <br />Let's make this clear up front, the Collector's Edition does bring some very much needed improvement.  Watching this film on my big screen is now a very enjoyable and worthwhile experience, despite the image quality still coming up a bit short.  Perhaps I've been spoiled by the razor-sharp picture that comes with today's big DVD releases like Lord of the Rings.  I think it would be fair to say that I'm just being nitpicky.  Nevertheless, a film like Baraka yearns to have a restoration and transfer that's on par with the Star Wars Trilogy DVD's.   <br /> <br />For those who have seen this film and enjoyed it as much or more than I have, then this DVD is a very worthwhile purchase.  Those who have not seen it need to rent it first.  Baraka needs to be taken for what it is, a collection of images ranging from beautiful and startling to chaotic and disturbing.  Some have chosen to decry Ron Fricke's acheivement.  I have even seen it called a racist film, which leaves me dumbfounded.  The message that continues to repeat for me each time I see it is the plight of mankind and how our greed, hatred, overconsumption and neglect is shaping our world.
B00005221M|2.0|I am a HUGE fan of this movie.  I want to see more.  Naturally, when the DVD comes out, you expect to see, even a little more than you saw at the theatre, just to give you a little taste of one more thought, one more moment w/ Nathaniel or whomever is your favorite character. I read the customer reviews that slammed this version and I thought 'Yeah, right\\".  I ordered it anyway.  They were right.  If this is the director's version, thank god he didn't have final say over the theatrical release.  It's amazing how small changes can ruin an entire movie.  He turned this unbelievably magical, wonderous movie into an \\"eh, ok\\" film!  He cut music cues.  He lowered volume, he ended music cues short.  For example: The love scene w/ Nathaniel and Cora was changed, but get this...  the music was lowered in volume to allow us to hear them breathing.  This enhances the scene?  The music is undoubtedly one of the greatest things about this film. The extra 30 seconds added to certain scenes were obviously cut for a reason.  SOOOOO not worth getting this version.  Michael, Mann, stick to directing and let the editors do their jobs.
B000084T18|4.0|This album is worth the money the lyrics are good people are hatin on him for a reason. If it wasn't for nas then 50 would be on top of the rap game.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite was absolutely hilarious for the plain fact that it really hit home. We all had a friend in school that was almost exactly like him. He was a nerd and he didn't care. He didn't buy into popularity nor was he trendy. When a movie sets out to show realism in it's truest form, no movie does it quite like Napoleon Dynamite. This movie, though it has little rising action, was captivating through it's unorthodox approach to story format. The comedic sense of the writers for this movie is very avant-garde. If you like movies such as Rushmore, The Royal Tenanbaums, Drop Dead Georgeous, and Life Aquatic then you will definitely love Napoleon Dynamite.
B0000029GA|5.0|Hip-hop fans do yourselves a favor go out and buy this masterpiece it is a classic, yea it's only 9 songs but there all dope. This album spits out wisdom so pick it up and gain some knowledge. Every song is dope but the one i liked the most off the album is memory lane. This album deserves 5 stars.

B00004TH6O|4.0|Great cd! to enjoy all time , not just one summer,  always!, this is a very logical progression , from being a cult band such as Kyuss to mutate into the format that modern hard rock/metal requires in this days, Homme and Olivieri created Queens of the Stone Age after Kyuss desintegration to maintain themselves on the bussiness for a new generation and they are doing it great so far. with influences that goes from sabbath (sabbath is always present) to 70s influences to grunge sounds, to alternative attitude, to Heavy Metal elements, Queens of the Stone Age have released three albums , Rated R is their begining to experimentation including some string sections and trumpeths parts of course not present in their most commercial songs)but present in some tracks that complete this album , rated R begins with \\"feel good hit of the summer\\" with droug connotations, \\"the lost art of keeping a secret\\" follows , awesome track, \\"leg of lamb\\" great rithm!!!!, \\"monster in your parasol\\" funny , very funny!!! good humor!!!!, this album definitelly worths to try.  <br />HM
6301966562|5.0|This is one of those movies that I remember from the 1980's that I enjoyed. I have not seen it in ages and would love to see it released on DVD. I now avoid movies on VHS and get all my movies on DVD. <br /> <br />While it is an older movie and the PC did thing that still can not be done today (i.e. act on its own), it was still an enjoyable movie and the idea of a PC falling in love with it's owner choice of girlfriend was an interesting plot twist.
B00000055E|5.0|If any one ever asks you what poetry means tell them to buy this album. all the songs are tight, even though pac wrote songs within 5mins and the beats he went over were not great just goes to show what talent he had. Clasic songs are nuttin to loose, open fire, and only fear is death...go buy it
1592400876|1.0|I bought this book for my husband for Christmas.  His comments below: <br /> <br />I was only able to get to page 55, since I was totally bored with the content.  The point on the misuse of the apostrophe, with examples, could have been made in two pages.  Additional belaboring (or belabouring, if preferable) this point was not instructive.  I have no interest in dealing with the next chapter on the comma, since the title of the book, along with the illustration, says it all. <br /> <br />S. David Weaver

0783225792|5.0|This movie is a classic, Robert Deniro holds it down in any role he takes. What these people do is pull off an ill scheme every month to collect doe and stay consistent on top of the casino. In the end the only one who makes out good is robert deniro, this is a must have if you like organized crime movies. First buy then watch  it ain't even worth the trip if your going to rent.
0446608955|5.0|There are few books that are as full of joy, sadness, and love as A Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks.  This book relays the tale of seventeen-year-old Langdon Carter and the girl who drastically changes his life.<br /><br /> The story is set in Beaufort, North Carolina, \\"...where the humidity rose so high in the summer that walking out to get the mail made a person feel as if he needed a shower, and the kids walked around barefoot from April through October beneath trees draped in Spanish moss.\\"  Langdon narrates the tale about himself and Jamie Sullivan.  Jamie is the ultimate \\"good girl.\\"  She rescues injured animals, raises money for the local orphanage, and, to top it all off, she's the preacher's daughter.  Jamie's life is sheltered; she doesn't have a boyfriend, nor does she attend school dances.  Langdon is somewhat of the reverse- he sneaks out of his house at night, and is viewed as \\"rebellious\\" because of it.  When the lives of these two opposites entangle, it transforms them both in ways they never could've imagined.<br /><br /> Nicholas Sparks' vivid imagery makes this story unforgettable; this book is for the romantic in all of us.  Sweet, yet tear-jerking, this will be the novel you pick up to read again and again.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|What more could you ask for from a German Expressionist, Weimar Republic era film. Over the top cheesy acting, powerful full orchestral soundtrack, stylised forced perspective photography with some of the earliest ground breaking special effects. The only shame is that the restoration still falls short after that American producer twit had it butchered to shorten the film and thus altering the story. Not only did this film represent the golden era of the silent cinema, but also sci-fi/fantasy films for generations to come. I love it!!!!!<br /><br />p.s and the robot!
B000092ZYX|5.0|I like Radiohead.  <br /> <br />If the above applies to you, how can you fail to give this album 5 stars --- Radiohead push themselves further and into more unknown territory with every release, and this is a prime example, their most diverse, interesting, beautiful and sonically inventive album yet. Until you have adjusted to the tracks, you are continually being surprised by the meandering turns the album takes, from pure, ballsbastic agression to subtle balladry and electronica, climaxing with the bittersweet melancholy of Wolf At The Door... They Are Geniuses and like no one before --- shove your pink floyd comparison's back where they came from <br /> <br />If, on the other hand, you dislike Radiohead. They're 'too weird' or 'depressed' or you 'don't like his voice'... then don't listen to this ---- but you're missing out on the biggest musical phenomenon since the beatles
0679731725|5.0|The other reviewers have written most of what I could say about this book so I will just add some extra perspectives I don't already see covered. <br /> <br />I read \\"When We Were Orphans\\" before this book and I haven't seen the movie.  Both books have \\"unreliable narrators\\". This one is much more believable and realistic. Memory truly does alter as the brain tries to reconstruct some sense from life.  I think dreams also tend to confuse us about what really happened. By comparison to this \\"When We Were Orphans\\" is just crazy and doesn't have any really deep messages IMHO. It is too far from reality to be great literature. <br /> <br />Another thought I had is that Stevens strikes me as almost autistic and also is almost like a slave. He has worked all his life as a single person in a position where he was responsible for managing many other workers and yet is thinking hard about whether he can afford to buy new clothes or go on this short trip. He never seems to have taken any time off before despite it being allowed by his employer.  <br /> <br />All the same I see lots of parallels between Stevens' life and my own, though obviously I'm aware of those things in a way that Steven's isn't until maybe it is too late. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002LIM|5.0|Undoubtably my favorite Elfman score.  It's dark, mysterious, gothic and operatic yet playful and touching too.  This isn't your typical action adventure film score.  \\"Childhood Remembered\\" starts off quiet and mysterious and carries you along until you reach the unerving ending.  I get chills most every time I listen to it.  Very creepy stuff.  Then you get big operatic tracks like \\"First Confrontation\\"  and action-packed tracks like \\"Attack of the Batwing.\\"  Somehow Elfman manages to keep all of this sounding fresh and give it his own personal falir.  Never do you have a sence of been there, done that with this score.  His sound in these days was very distinct something that he's strayed from in recent films.<br /><br />For fans of Elfman, Batman, gothic music and/or film scores this is something that should not be passed up.  A distinctive one-of-a-kind find.
B000063DHL|5.0|I worked as a temporary roadie for this show in Munich, Germany in 1986. The show will stay in my memory forever as the best concert I have ever seen. Bruce Dickinson was in rare form that night, never missing a beat when Eddie (In this incarnation a huge robot with his own separate generator to keep him going) \\"attacked\\" him on stage. Theatrics notwithstanding, the quality of the performance was up to the usually high Maiden standard, the pyrotechnics near perfect. I have always considered them Metal's ambassadors of intelligent yet fun hard rock. This album is proof that they are. I own most of their work, and still consider \\"Alexander the Great\\" their masterpiece...Simply brilliant.
B00008CLOA|5.0|This is Pink floyds best album maybe the best album of all time. <br />And to the person below me what the hell u doing listning to ashlee simpson anyways.
B00006G8G1|5.0|Nice to see a great Maiden show so many years after they started making music. Bruce acquits himself very well as one of the great metal singers of all time. The 3 guitar lineup is really fun to watch, and the crowd is very much in to the show. The song list is very good (Have to leave out some classics with a band like this or the show would be 12 hours long!) and the musicianship is choice. Just a great show for any Maiden or metal fan! Make sure you have a great stereo system so you don't miss anything!
0441009425|2.0|It took me quite a long time to finish this book because it is such a long-winded novel, full of hundreds of totally unnecessary sub-plots that never resolve into anything remotely interesting, let alone vital to the story. The author's terribly annoying tendency to end each \\"scene\\" on a supposed cliffhanger really worked my nerves after the first 100 pages or so, and then even more so as I realized it would continue throughout the rest of the book. To end each scene with some profound statement, and then return to it--without consequence--leads the reader to mistrust the author's direction and leading in the book, for every scene is presented as a turning point in the story--which is not true. I was exasperated halfway through to find that there really was no cliffhanger, no compelling core story to draw me in, and found it very difficult to finish the book.<br /><br />There are some interesting points in this book, but most of them are utterly unfinished and will leave you with a very underwhelming sense of theft in the end, as if the inter-personal relationships, conflicts, and sub-plots were utterly irrelevant. I found myself not caring what happened to the main characters, for there truly was no single character with which I could relate.<br /><br />Utterly unsatisfying, hard to read, and therefore deserving of 2 stars (1 of which is provided only due to a creative ending, which while unsatisfying on the character level, was intriguing in scope).
B000031WD9|5.0|If my husband and I get bored on a Saturday we just pop in the American Pie series.  It's so funny how watching these crazy guys try and lose their virginities by prom night never gets old! This movie is also highly recommended for parties, because with a group of people it gets so much more funny! <br />Though, if you are not entertained by crude humor and language then this movie is not for you.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Britney Spears is not a talented singer.  Truth be told, the above album attempts to cover this up with the latest in technology - space-aged technology.  But no amount of Pro Tools reverb can cover up this simple fact: talentless dribble will not last the test of time and become part of the next Time-Life music anthology.
B00005JMCT|3.0|Don't get me wrong...this was a great third part of the great American Pie trilogy but I thought they got carried away with some things.  Stifler's character was always slightly on the retarded side, but I felt like they overdid his crude attitude in this movie.  That was unnecessary, and Jim seemed even more dumb than in the first two movies (take a certain shaving incident!).  Nevertheless, this movie has some very sweet parts aside from the crude humor. <br />The bonus material on the DVD isn't half bad either.  There's the making of featurette, deleted scenes, and outtakes.  Good to keep you occupied for a while. :)
0385510454|3.0|Decent book, a little too short on the substance, but nonetheless one that I read in a single sitting.  I reccomend it for an easy read that is entertaining and a nice book for a cold evening
B000056QCZ|5.0|This CD is definetly worth buying. Hendrix's guitar playing and vocals just blew me away. The sad thing is though, is that he plays better than most modern music!! if you have heard some of todays rock like st.anger and hoobastank or midtown, but hendrix just blows them away. Definitly buy this awesome music

B00007L7FN|4.0|After the dark space ambience of their previous release,\\"Zeit\\",\\"Atem\\",TD's 4th album,released in 1973,is significantly lighter in tone when you compare the two.This release not only marks the changing sound of TD at the time,but also marks the band's first use of the then new Mellotron synthesizer.Out of this new synth model,a whole new sound was beginning to emerge from the depths of the Tangerine Dream well,and to good effect.The album opens on an unusually,surprisingly,energetic note on the opening moments of the title piece,\\"Atem\\",which really drives the piece along,but before long,the energy abruptly gives way to the classic TD musical sound of eerie,synthesized silence.For a moment,you can actually hear yourself breathing,as the eerie quiet synth backdrops sound like a soundtrack from a horror movie,and while the synths are at a low sound spectrum,they still manage to sound menacing,like one of those minutes where everything is relaxed,albeit eerie,but it is still threatening,as if there's something horrible around the corner,just waiting to ambush you,and while the synths and soundeffects do pick up in frequency and volume every now and then,nothing major really happens,and the piece eventually fades into silence,and ends.A brilliant work that proves that Tangerine Dream was the master of suspense among all the similar competing groups of the time.The second track,\\"Fauni Gena\\",features sustained recordings of what sound like birds in a jungle,chirping in the background,while a beautiful,yet eerie synthesized flute plays a structured tune,with support from other synths which make this piece turn out to be as close to meditative as Tangerine Dream was willing to go,but without sacrificing their trademark dark sound.A beautiful,relaxing,yet eerie and uneasy piece.The third track,\\"Circulation Of Events\\",is a very short work in terms of TD's standard track lengths at the time,clocking in at only about 5 minutes.Not much to say about this piece,except that despite the time constraint,the band was still able to make another great experimental cut.The last track on this album,\\"Wahn\\",is the reason why I rated this album 4 stars instead of 5.This piece is unique in Tangerine Dream's complete line of work,because here,they seem to have gone insane,by using their shameful vocal talents by way of grunts,shouts,and screams,that can easily disturb even the most accustomed fans of experimental/ambient music.Even I was disturbed when I first listened to this track,and I have to say,even today,I still don't much care for it because it detracts from the mood that the rest of the album set up,and is in no way in line with what the band was trying to accomplish at the time.There is a limit to everything,including experimentalism,and too much of it can add up with bad results,and \\"Wahn\\" is a perfect example of it.Thank goodness TD didn't try this ever again,because if they would have,it probably would have had negative consequences for the band.But don't let that set you off from buying this album,because the other three tracks on this album are all good enough to override the flaw of the final track.Overall,this album is just as good as TD's albums before it,and represents a snapshot of TD's metamorphosis of their sound from space music to more ambient sounding recordings.Happy Listening!the time constraint,the band was still able to make another great experimental cut.The last track on this album,\\"Wahn\\",is the reason why I rated this album 4 stars instead of 5.This piece is unique in Tangerine Dream's complete line of work,because here,they seem to have gone insane,by using their shameful vocal talents by way of grunts,shouts,and screams,that can easily disturb even the most accustomed fans of experimental/ambient music.Even I was disturbed when I first listened to this track,and I have to say,even today,I still don't much care for it because it detracts from the mood that the rest of the album set up,and is in no way in line with what the band was trying to accomplish at the time.There is a limit to everything,including experimentalism,and too much of it can add up with bad results,and \\"Wahn\\" is a perfect example of it.Thank goodness TD didn't try this ever again,because if they would have,it probably would have had negative consequences for the band.But don't let that set you off from buying this album,because the other three tracks on this album are all good enough to override the flaw of the final track.Overall,this album is just as good as TD's albums before it,and represents a snapshot of TD's metamorphosis of their sound from space music to more ambient sounding recordings.Happy Listening!
6301562178|4.0|It was nice to see Steve McQueen again after all these years. The movie has special effects based upon the capabilities that existed 30 years ago before the computer age. It also has some of the movie stars of the period. The movie at over 2 1/2 hours was a large undertaking that was possible by the joining together of two Hollywood Studios.
0316172324|3.0|As a political organizer I found Gladwell's \\"Tipping Point\\" to be essential reading for anyone looking for a better understanding about how to change people's minds.  I had hoped that \\"Blink\\" would offer further insight.  On some levels it does - Gladwell's theory seems to be accurate.  Despite being an excellent writer, however, he harms his thesis by using poor examples.<br /><br />The general idea behind \\"Blink\\" is how to make better snap judgments by examining those who are successful at making such quick judgments and those who have made blunders in various circumstances (whether they be expert or not).<br /><br />On the issue of having excess knowledge Gladwell uses the example of the US military practicing for Gulf War II against an \\"unnamed Middle Eastern leader.\\"  (It's obvious the person they had in mind was Saddam Hussein.) He repeatedly refers to this leader as having \\"strong religious support.\\"  Illustrating Gladwell's unfamiliarity with the topic he fails to mention in his analysis of the military that Saddam was a _secular_ leader and was viewed as evil by Islamic fundamentalists.  In other words, one of the key elements of the _premise_ created by the military (which Gladwell does not question) is obviously false.<br /><br />Gladwell insinuates that the US military has had trouble in Iraq because it concentrated on having too much intelligence and can't filter out what is important.  While they may or may not be true as a contributing negative factor, it is an argument that shows a lack of political knowledge.  There is clear evidence, as stated by the former head of the National Security Agency and Counter Intelligence at the CIA, that the Bush administration pushed for analysis that would reflect their goals.  These obvious political motivations don't even enter into Gladwell's analysis.  But then, that would destroy this example as a metaphor for his overall (legitimate) thesis.<br /><br />This failure to question the premise for one's actions shows up in one of his most central examples - the NYPD shooting of an unarmed black man who was reaching for his wallet.  Gladwell isolates the incident to a few seconds.  This fits his theory.  He never addresses the general NYC environment in which many New Yorkers felt they were under assault by the police. This environment, combined with an obvious focus on racial minorities, helped create the shooting.  Obviously, the police didn't intend to kill an innocent man. But their actions took place within a larger context - and Gladwell ignores it completely.<br /><br />The most glaring flaw in Gladwell's examples is his insistence on using issues of personal taste as proof that someone is somehow an \\"expert\\" or \\"knows more than others.\\"<br /><br />For example, Gladwell repeatedly talks about the singer Kenna and how he was shafted by the music industry because flawed surveys showed that the public wouldn't like his work.  I listened to several Kenna songs after reading this book.  I don't like Kenna!  But this doesn't make me right and Gladwell wrong.  It just means we have different tastes.  It comes off as nothing less than arrogance on the part of Gladwell to argue that experts inherently know more when it comes to something as personal as musical preferences which are so obviously linked to culture, family upbringing, etc.<br /><br />Despite these huge criticisms, I think Gladwell's theory is correct.  We can make quicker judgments if we're able to filter out all the excess garbage.  This works when we're dealing with a B&W outcome.  For example, is this art real or fake?  Does this medical procedure help or harm patients?  Does this police procedure benefit the commuhity? These are all examples used in the book.  They work.  It's just a shame that Gladwell had to muddy up the water with all these other inappropriate examples.
B000002AP1|5.0|i recently tracked down the original \\"bowie mix\\" and its terrible ,sounds like it was played through a trashcan with a mic at the end ,iggys mix is the best ive heard ,its tough as hell and its too bad it wasnt released this way in '73 ,then maybe we wouldnt have all of these sissy ass bands trying to make garage rock that all seem to come from new york and australia (you know who you are),but i do get what the \\"purists\\" say about this album ,how it wasnt really the stooges and everything ,and that \\"FUNHOUSE\\" is the better album of the stooges trilogy,even though this isnt the best stooges album it blows all of this new sh*t away .
B00005JNJ7|5.0|This movie hits the spot! It reflects exactly how the rest of the world sees the self-obsessed insular culture of the USA.  I love the subtitle \\"Panama Canal - Central America (1093 miles south of the REAL America)\\" it says everything it needs to say in that one subtitle...! <br /> <br />The USA needs to learn that there is a world outside North America and that world generally classes Americans as gung-ho morons.  And the rest of the world generally do not class actors as potentially powerful political figures....?!? <br /> <br />I remember walking out of the cinema and saying to my friend - \\"That wouldn't have gone down too well in the States. I think they wouldn't have understood half of the satire and just translated it as plain offensive, probably even purile\\". <br /> <br />What else do I need to say..?
0790737345|3.0|I want to explain why I don't like this movie, without spoiling anything.  First off, this movie has one of the most fantastic soundtracks ever, and I fully reccomend buying it, even if you never see the movie, it's fantastic.<br /><br />Second... hmmm... I like movies that make me think.  If it's a comedy, great jokes, a fun time... If it's a drama, I want real issues, I want a good plot... and if it's a tragedy... well, there better should be a good reason to make it a tragedy.<br /><br />This movie makes me feel helpless.  There is a point they continually try to drive home in this film, so much so that it overwhelms you at times.  That point is life, breathing, thinking, feeling, living.  The movie has Angels in it.  Angels cannot feel, cannot touch, can't feel emotion.  An angel asks a child in the beginning what she will miss about life.  She says \\"fuzzy pajamas\\".  It's about textures, it seems.<br /><br />Well they make their point, they make it well... aaaaaaannnnd then they go overboard.  This movie could have been fantastic and meaningful, and they felt like they had to push it too far to make their point.  We get it, okay, we get it... you didn't have to go and make it end like that, okay?<br /><br />Basically I loved this movie until I got to the end.  I've never watched it again.  Why did I even give it 3 stars then?  Well, because I thought that until the end, they did a great job.  So, just turn it off 10 minutes before the credits.  It's perfect then.
1592400876|3.0|I was not really sure about this book and found it a bit of a rollercoaster. Funny but also dull at times. Only read it if you've nothing else to do
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Ever After is my favorite movie.  When I was single, I think I watched it every day.  I'm a romantic, I can't help it, and the situations, characters, and lines from this movie are just fantastic.  It's ranked by most of my guy friends as a \\"chick flick\\", and I think I would have to agree to that stereotype.  It's most definately a romantic comedy.  The story is played out as if the legend of Cinderella were true, complete with the brothers Grimm meeting with an elderly French woman in the beginning, who claims to be decended from Cinderella herself.  It is exceeding well done, in fact, some of the English teachers at my school use it as an example and show it in class.  The cast are well-suited to their roles, Drew pulls it off with a great performance.<br /><br />This is definately a movie to see if you're a romantic or a sentimentalist.  It's a sweet love story, about actually loving the person you are with, and about how being a good person helps out a lot in life... especially when you have to deal with a wicked stepmother!
B000268QB2|5.0|Before I begin, I have to say that the people who bought this album are amazing. They also bought The Killers, Franz Ferdinand, Maroon5...my other favorites!<br /><br />Anyways, when I first heard of Keane, their video for \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" popped on the television, and I fell in love instantly. I love the fact that they are guitarless - who needs them in order to play lovely rock songs!<br /><br />I think the word that describes Keane's sound is...well...beautiful! Their music is so relaxing, yet bouncy and fun. I love listening to them; it somehow puts me in a good mood, no matter how bummed I am.<br /><br />My favorite song off this album would have to be \\"Bedshaped\\". It grew on me after I bought it, and it's just amazing. The video is brilliant, too.<br /><br />I'm surprised you don't have this album yet! Jeez! Go pick it up!
B0002OERI0|5.0|There's a fine line between beautiful and ugly, angry and sad, redundent and powerfull. Green Day treads this line on their latest album with an expertise not shown before. they extend themselves to new levels with ten minute tracks like \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" which, without getting overly expressive and wordy, express their deep thoughts. what's the point in using words like \\"indelible\\" if the majority of your audience, teenagers, aren't going to have a clue what your talking about? <br /> <br />Simple does not mean stupid. With care and beauty, Billie Joe brings out emotions i never thought a Green Day CD could. He is sad, but not whiney. Loud, but not angry. slow, but not depressing. It's Green Day better than ever, and It's perfect. <br /> <br />As expressed in tracks like \\"St. Jimmy\\" and \\"American Idiot,\\" the little boy hiding in his room in \\"Longview\\" has finally grown up... and he's angry.
B000002LN9|4.0|I love live Clapton releases.  This is a good release but I feel the songs are rushed and bland compared to other \\"live\\" versions.  I cannot stomach the end of \\"Wonderful Tonight\\", especially if you ever seen the video of it, sounds like a cat in heat...but there are highlights including the songs released during this time period \\"Pretending\\", \\"Bad Love\\", and a nice version of \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\"....maybe this was the 24th night, I just feel the energy had left the building.
6302886228|4.0|Too bad this is only in VHS; it is absolutely an amazing concert. Alas, I will have to hold on to my money until the DVD comes out!
B000002MTU|4.0|Should be four and a half stars, maybe five.  This cd is worth the price and sounds great.  Clapton has selected the best blues material compared with his other compilation blues releases.  Some of the songs on this release are always played during a Clapton concert and you can feel his true emotion as he rips through the songs on this release.  In true form, this release followed \\"Unplugged\\" and shows Clapton at his best.
0694003611|5.0|Well what more can you say about a book that has been around  and in print for over 50 years?  Margaret Wise Brown's Goodnight Moon is a certified, bonafide classic.  It is THE book for reading to infants and toddlers at bedtime.  The simple, yet elegant prose of Ms. Wise Brown translates as well to kids now as they did back in 1947.<br /><br />The Illustrations by Clement Hurd perfectly compliment the poetry and is the kind os soothing book that really lulls kids to sleep..hopefully!  This is the kind of book that can be kept and treasured through the years.  Read with the kids and then the grandkids someday.  Also, if you know people with kids of that age group, it makes a perfect gift as well.  Anyone can appreciate a book of such high caliber.  Wonderful book!
0425152251|3.0|Imagine, walking home on day to find an blank white envelope with no postage and the question of \\"who are you?\\" written inside. After the initial shock you start to think, questioning your reality. Welcome to Sophie's World, where 14 year old Sophie Amundsen received such an envelope, the first of many in her philosophy course with the mysterious Philosophy professor Alberto Knox.  <br /> Sophie's World offers a complete review of western philosophy including Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle as the delectable appetizer. Moving on to a scrumptious course of medieval and renaissance philosophers and scientists such as Galileo, Newton, and Descartes. And finishing with a desert of more modern times including people such as Darwin, Marx, and theories such as the big bang.  <br /> One of the other beauties of Sophie's World is the way in which the descriptions of complex thoughts and ideas are first stated plainly and confusingly, then simplified into a more understandable description, then to make sure you still aren't lost, they are presented yet again using simple examples that ether make the subject comprehensible, or drive the point home. At times this can be annoying; like a little sibling always replying to all your explanations with \\"why?\\" but for the times that you do need it your glad its there.  <br /> The dialogue in the book is forced and is never believable, even when they are not talking about philosophy. Most of the time it is just Alberto rambling about philosophy with Sophie occasionally chiming in to question something allowing Gaarder to present the explanations that I was talking about. At times Sophie will be very insightful, and then the next second she will not have a clue what is being talked about, which is to say the least an extremely annoying inconsistency. Such unnatural details can keep you from getting into the book and always makes it feel like you are only reading the book and not living the experience as many good novels do.  <br />In conclusion, Sophie's World is an intriguing novel covering a great deal of great philosophers, but it has little else. With dialogue that is anything but believable and little to no comprehendible plot it is not one of the greatest books ever written, but it still covers concepts that get the gears in your head turning if you let it.
B000008J3I|5.0|Mike Oldfield, a multi-instrumentalist, achieved worldwide success with his debut, Tubular bells, but never came close to matching its success again although his albums continued to sell well in his British homeland. This collection of his music from the seventies, eighties and early nineties shows Mike's development as an artist. Although titled Elements, this is really a Best of package.<br /><br />The set opens with the opening theme to Tubular bells and includes his four British top ten hits (In Dulce Jubilo, Portsmouth, Moonlight shadow, Sentinel) as well as Family man, which was only a minor UK hit for Mike but which became a top twenty UK hit via a cover by Hall and Oates. Some of Mike's lesser hits are missing including the UK top twenty hit, Blue Peter, which is Mike's interpretation of the theme to the long-running children's TV series - it was even used on the TV for a few years.<br /><br />The vastly under-appreciated Maggie Reilly (a brilliant soprano) sings on some of Mike's records, most notably Moonlight shadow, an extremely sad song albeit with a bouncy tune. Another brilliant guest vocalist is Bonnie Tyler, featured on Islands.<br /><br />While you might wish to buy the original Tubular bells album in its entirety, this sampling of Mike's best music spanning nearly twenty years shows plenty of variety.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A look at what will likely be the future of the human race, seen through the eyes of an off-beat band of smugglers, scratching out a living against some pretty heavy odds.  Not a lot in the way of special effects (no hokey alien monsters or light sabers), but the space-chase effects in \\"Serenity\\" are mind-blowing.  Relying mainly on terrific characters, stories and dialogue, this DVD set is one I definitely recommend!  The one sour note is the rather hammy acting of Adam Baldwin, who probably should stick to the \\"B\\" movies for which he's better known.  The rest of the cast is stellar, though, and more than enough to carry him.
B000002KKD|4.0|Many considor this to be the best new-wave album. I think that honor belongs to \\"Are We Not Men?\\", but this is close to that title. I'm sorry to say that the best songs on this disc are the \\"classics\\", \\"Rock Lobster\\", \\"Lava\\", \\"Hero Worship\\", and \\"6060-842\\". As I stated above, this album grows on you. I listened to it the day I bought it, and didn't really see the appeal. However, the songs started to grow on me. They grew on me slowly but largely. Now, I considor this to be one of the 70s best. A slightly overrated album, but great nonetheless.
B00005NTNU|5.0|Dirty Harry is one of the best american movie series because it started a new generation of action with technology and new kind of guns in the present instead of cowboys in the past. <br />Here my points: <br />* Dirty Harry is the original and the best movie of the series, is action-packed with memorial phrases. (inspired Lethal Weapon, Beverly Hills Cop, Die Hard, Pulp Fiction and Rush Hour 2) <br /> <br />* Magnun Force is good as Dirty Harry but not THAT original and memorable, the motorcicle scene is a classic. <br /> <br />* The Enforcer is good but ONLY because Harry wields a bazooka, the ending is stupid and there isn't much action as the other two. (inspired Lethal Weapon 2, Rambo, Cobra and The Rock) <br /> <br />I didn't watched the other last two movies because they were made in the 80's and everybody knows that the 80's action movies with guns are LAME!!!!!!!!!!! <br />The only good movies are: <br />* Scarface (the best) <br />* Die Hard <br />* Aliens <br />* Rambo (is really not that good but is original) <br />* Indiana Jones (not much action with guns but is cool) <br />* Terminator (Is good but the sequel was 10 times much better)  <br /> <br />adios!!
B00065GX64|5.0|M is a masterpiece. The story of a child murderer who is tormented by his own guilt and hunted by both the police and the underworld. Peter Lorre as the serial killer, Hans Beckert gives the performance of a lifetime. Indeed Lorre's performance in this film is the equal to anything done by Brando and Olivier. Lorre both repulses us and makes us sympathetic at the same time. What a pity that Hollywood wasted his talent. He gives very enjoyable performances in many other films, Casablanca and The Raven come to mind, but having seen M, Lorre was capable of much more. <br /> <br />Frtz Lang not only shows us the internal torments of a a killer but a city tearing itself apart as people become suspicous of their firends and neighbours. Also I have never seen a film with so much smoking, quite often you have to wait until the tobacco haze clears to see what is happening. As a smoker myself all I can say is 'Those were the days.' <br /> <br />Watch M and see the best ever film about a serial killer.
B0001ZMWQO|2.0|Franz Ferdinand are basically Scotland's answer to The Strokes--a mildly enjoyable but very safe band with very obvious influences and retro shtick. Except that instead of emulating Lou Reed and Television, Franz Ferdinand have mined the territory of post-punk/new wave outfits like The Cure, XTC, and Gang Of Four and slathered an extra pop gloss over it.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with a little catchiness or using bands in that league for inspiration. In fact, it can be a very good thing. However unlike, say, The White Stripes, Franz Ferdinand know how to ape their influences but never really develop a solid sound of their own. They're not as obnoxiously derivative as Jet and their ilk, but they still lack personality.<br /><br />As far as the record goes, I like Jacqueline and Take Me Out (though the riff bears a suspicious resemblance to Led Zeppelin's Trampled Underfoot), and Darts Of Pleasure isn't too bad either--all catchy pieces of angular, dancy new wave. But the lyrics are generally banal, and there isn't much to catch the ear on repeat listens. Instead of simply hopping on the pro-Franz bandwagon, go pick up Black Sea by XTC, Entertainment! by Gang Of Four, Head On The Door by The Cure, and ANYTHING Joy Division immediately. There's nothing in this debut that you can't hear in those albums and done better to boot.
B00005JNJT|5.0|the year i was born. batman came out. i was first exposeed to it when i was about 5, then batman returns shortly after that. and those are my 2 favorite movies of all time. and the animated series was amazing as well. but batman forever and batman and robin didnt make batman look dark and gritty. they made him look tacky and well...too much of a good guy. this movie has the scarecrow and ras 'a goul as the villians and i have been waiting for the scarecrow for ever. behind the joker, the scarecrow is where it is at. this movie will be great if A. its gritty. B. if christian bale dosnt suck. C. katie holms isnt overused. and D. they make refrences to jack napier and harvey dent and things of that nature. not tell them there future villians. but at least let us batman fans know that these guys were around and doing stuff to get media attention. good or bad. well july 17th....lets go in the cinema with our fingers crossed
B0002S94OS|4.0|For those of you who don't understand the irony of my title, just stop reading now and go buy a Cradle CD because this band is too sophisticated for you. <br /> <br />Now to the review: <br />Lamb of God's second CD was hailed with critical acclaim and won some best album of the year nods.  However, I was totally let down with \\"As the Palaces Burn\\" because it lacked was no where near as good as the bands first two releases (first as Burn the Priest), particularly the brutal and choatic \\"New American Gospel.\\"  \\"Ashes\\" is a huge step forward for Lamb of God, but to understand my major gripe with this album, you have to hear the demos that were out before the album came out, particularly the albums key song, \\"Laid to Rest.\\"  The vocals are overproduced to give the band some mainstream expsoure and the riffs are cleaned up like \\"Palaces\\" when the band sounds much better underproduced on their demos.  Randy's vocals are way too clean and take away from a lot of what makes him stand out from other vocalists in the genre.  However, the drums still rock just as much as ever.  I can't get enough of Chris' style.  It's very unique and is the trademark to any Lamb of God track. <br /> <br />As for you douche naysayers, don't come out hear and blast the band and don't say why.  Explain your grievance with the band instead of dismissing everything they do. <br /> <br />Notebale tracks - \\"Laid to Rest\\", \\"Now You've Got Something to Die For\\", \\"Omerta\\"
6304346107|4.0|let me preface this by saying I haven't read the novel yet. This version of Emma is a darker (in comparison) version when reviewed next to the Gwneth Paltrow version. Both versions are enjoyable, and have their own set of good and bad points. This version's main sticking point with me is the lighting, which gives most of the movie a dreary dark outlook. But on the plus side, there are scenes in this version that are great additions-I especially like the final scene where Knightley invites his tenants to his wedding-much to the vicar's wife's dismay-which is very enjoyable as they are two stick in the mud's. Mark's Strong's portrayal of Knightley is different than Jeremy Northern's, but not worse, just different.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to any period movie buff. I like different versions of the same movie-kind of like different versions of the same recipe. Different, but still tasty! 4 stars!
B000002HH2|5.0|This sophomore puts the debut to shame, never has a second album been so more mature and melodic. <br />This has some fantastic songs including \\"Its Oh So Quiet\\" which really does take you back. <br />The album is a mix of fully f***ed up dance and fusion pop. <br />\\"Debut\\" was too shy and lacking but this is full on and in your face. <br />How can you ignore this album? <br />Its superb and as usual Bjork comes up with something heroic. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005MP58|5.0|let me first say that if you already have the boxed VHS set, like the other reviewers, I'd stick with that. The picture quality does seem a bit \\"off\\" in this DVD version. But, simply the fact that it's easier to load two discs than SIX tapes is a selling point for me:) The behind the scenes special feature was also fun.<br /><br />If you've never seen this production, and are a fan of top quality, period, especially regency period dramas, then I cannot recommend this enough. I've watched this numerous times, and find every time as enjoyable as the last. Jennifer Ehle's performance is top notch!!  Most go on about Colin Firth, who is perfection in this as well, but not enough is said about Miss Ehle's superb performance.<br /><br />But what really makes this production is the outstanding supporting cast. This, as well as the accurate and enjoyable sets, make this far and away the best A & E production so far.  May I also recommend the BBC production of Persuasion(Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root) if you like this production-a close second in this \\"Austenite's\\" favorite adaptions to Jane Austen's novels. 5 stars *****
068987474X|2.0|I read and enjoyed the first chapter.  The second chapter was good.  By the third chapter, I was looking for something that hadn't already been said.  He takes one new sentence for the chapter title, then repeats the same information as he did in the first two.  This would be better as just a magazine article than a whole book.  I am dissapointed with this, and feel it was a waste of money.
074322454X|4.0|R.A. Forzyk's 1-star review has at least one glaring error itself. <br /> <br />\\"It gets worse. Ambrose asserts that Winters \\"is contemptuous of exaggeration,\\" but the following account of E Company in Normandy flatly exposes this as a lie: \\"So was Winters [outstanding]. He made one right decision after another ...he personally killed more Germans and took more risks than anyone else.\\" So Winters killed more Germans than the company machine-gunners? He took more risks than the men on point? Interestingly, Winters was never wounded.\\" <br /> <br />That passage was in reference to the battle at the crossroads in Belgium, not Normandy.
0345440900|5.0|Great book! Life saver. Makes life very easy and baby very happy!
B00008PX8P|5.0|God I wish I could have seen Led Zepplin live. I was too young to know about them before Bohnam died. Their albums have been a testament - this DVD is their sacrament. You must have it. No exceptions. The footage is priceless, and the sound is flawless.<br /><br />There will never be another band to match Led Zepplin.
B000000W3G|5.0|To me, The Aeroplane Flies High is the Pumpkins best effort ever. Though it's not a collective effort like an album, the sum of it's parts is a great work in itself. Every other SP album sounds laboured, tested, calculated compared to Aeroplane. It's like an EP on steroids. unlike LP's, EP's allow musicians space for left of center experimentation, covers and songs that aren't hindered by the yolk of an LP format. In this case, it's all the singles from Melon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, plus their respective b-sides. Among them you get Tom Waits-esque/early 20th century-type parlour songs, electronics, 70's and 80's new wave and goth covers, epic metal, country, folk and atmospheric post-punk-ness. There is much variety to be experianced here! I highly recommend giving the 1979 single several spins as Cherry, Ugly and Set The Ray To Jerry have a band that is normally known for it's revival of classic rock bombast playing at their most restrained and ambient. Minimalist Pumpkins? How oxymoronic!<br /><br />Probably one of their last interesting releases, in my book.
068987474X|2.0|This book is pathetic for making women feel even more pathetic! Let's turn the tables for a moment: <br /> <br /> If a man were attempting to date a single mom with 2 teen-agers in her house, she owns, manages and markets her own business with five employees, and last but not least she is studying to be licensed as a medical professional.  <br />Now this dear lady has not responded to the gentleman's calls and/or emails in his expected time frame. Would the author dare tell this man that \\"She's just not that into you!\\"  I think not! <br /> <br />There are no \\"pat\\" answers. As mature, intelligent people you have to trust your feelings and above all COMMUNICATE with each other!
B0002X314C|5.0|\\"Get Lifted\\" is one of the best R&B albums by a male singer in years. John's almost in a league by himself. No other male R&B artist is drafting songs like: LET'S GET LIFTED, I CAN CHANGE, STAY WITH YOU, or LIVE IT UP. He's creating songs that will still be good 10-20 years from now. It's difficult to create an album that's both artistic and commercially viable. But John succeeded. Some people fly on the commercial end, but the artistic merits are minimal. \\"Get Lifted\\" represents the best of both. John Legend is the rare singer that comes around every so many years. He's worth remembering. Those interested in having a serious R&B recording career should take a good listen to this album. Aspire to this level. I would definitely recommend this CD.
B000002L68|5.0|I have always intentionally avoided writing a review on Prince because it would be hard to find the words. What else can you really say about the Artist? Truly, he may be one of the only few left in America today. Prince's uncanny nature for always re-inventing himself is no news and you can hardly keep up with him. Plus he has real and raw talent, just like his music.He plays what he pleases and does not play to please- true mark of an artist to follow his heart and instincts. \\"Purple Rain\\" is a great CD that shows the versatility of Prince to be able to play any kind of music, and perfectly well too. The title track is great, \\"When Doves Cry\\" is a wonderful song with a thoughtful message that defied the norms of adding some bass. One of my favorites, \\"The Beautiful Ones\\" is especially beautiful when it rises to a climax when he says:\\"Do you want me....\\" \\"I would Die For You\\", \\"Let's Go Crazy\\" with the gospo-sermonic introduction if you will. All of the songs make a really great package for the movie of the same title. This is Prince in his habitat, performing and showcasing his talent, singing and dancing, his tight guitar licks, especially at the end of the song \\"Purple Rain\\".<br />Prince is a different artist with each release so I cannot tell you which of his CDs is the best. But \\"Purple Rain\\" is a classic. \\"Sign of The Times\\" is excellent,and another favorite of mine is \\"Diamonds and Pearls\\" which when listened to side-by-side \\"Purple Rain\\" and his early works from the \\"Controversy\\" days, shows the true versatility of Prince's ability to make any kind of music, and proving that music has no color.<br />I was at his sold-out \\"Musicology\\" concert and this man still has what it takes after all these years, re-inventing and playing music successfully by defying the norms of show business and the business behind show business. That's why he rules!
B00005JMEW|4.0|If you liked a movie like Pulp Fiction (I believe it was from Tarantino too) you will definately like this film.  It is sliced into chapters that are each individual stories which do not happen in sequential order.  Each chapter is excellent in itself (one chapter is done in animation) and the only reason I didn't rate the movie higher is the time sequencing sometimes gets confusing and by the end of the movie you still don't understand what happened to have Uma Thurman's wedding party attacked. <br /> <br />The fight scenes are very unique and extremely gory, though a lot of the blood looks like colored water from a sprinkler.  Tarantino has a lot of tributes to Bruce Lee such as using the Flight of the Bumblebee song (theme of the Green Hornet), having several of the villians wear Green Hornet masks, and having Uma wear a Bruce Lee type body suit (a la Game of Death) in the grand finale fight sequences.
B0002ZMITY|4.0|I'm shocked that so many people think this movie sucks.  Sure it lacks a good plot, but what were people expecting?  Some kind complicated and intelligent plot?  Anybody who didn't laugh during the debate scene is a bell end. <br />Pretty much if Malibu's Most Wanted was actually funny and British, it would be Ali G Indahouse.  At least rent it and make your own decision.
B00005OAA6|1.0|I understand everyone has the right to their opinion, but this was worst than Milli Vinili. If I were to choose the singing vocals between Victoria Beckham a.k.a. Posh Spice, I would give back the grammys' to Milli Vinnili. Thank goodness this crap isn't being blasted on the airwaves in the U.S. I did listen to all the samples, but with much pain. I wanted to be at least fair minded, but for all our sakes, Posh will only be remembered as a \\"Spice\\" girl. I couldn't give the rating I wanted to, but since this is a scale with a lowest number of 1, this will have to do. Enough said....
B000002OMN|5.0|The FIRST rock ablum I ever owned that I could listen to all the way without skipping a single track. Jim Steinman is the coolest.  He is a great songwriter.  Meatloaf is the only one worthy enough to sing these classics... Need I say more?
0385335482|5.0|This was trully a fun and whimsical read. it kept me smiling and laughing the whole time. Just a great read that i would recomment to everyone. P.S. it was kind of fun to figure out what some of the words mean since they mean different things in england than they do here.
B00000IN5G|5.0|Hatebreeder is perfect. It was the first Bodom album I bought, and it remains my favorite. Every song has pounding riffs, incredible solos, and just rocks in general. Many people don't like Alexi's vocals, but even if you are one of those people, the music is still excellent. If you are a fan of metal and/or a guitar player, buy this album first.
B00006RINF|4.0|For a person relatively new to this type of music, I am pleasantly surprised. Really. Cristina's vocals are hauntingly beautiful (yes. I know that that's all you've been hearing in all of the past reviews. But there really is no other way to describe it.) It may have been better if she had sung all of the vocals instead of Andrea, since she has a better voice (... that's just my opinion.) but it's okay. She does get her own song in \\"Ghost Woman\\". Er, my favorites are \\"Swamped\\", \\"Aeon\\", and \\"Ghost Woman and the Hunter.\\"
B00009Y3L4|5.0|In 1966, a new show opened on Broadway that would forever change musicals.  Heard that before?  Yes, but in this case it was most certainly true.  My first experience with Cabaret was with a tape of the motion picture soundtrack.  I had never heard of the musical, but just listening made me love it.  How couldn't I?  I then became extremely fascinated and bought the Broadway recording as well.  Both movie and stage version share similiar songs and some key plot moments, but they are very different animals.  Sally is British in the stage version. The role was originally meant for Minelli, but Harold Prince thought Sally Bowles really had to be second rate and British, so Sally was played by Jill Haworth and later revived in the mid 90's with Natasha Richardson filling in the \\"green nails\\".  When Bob Fosse was approached, Liza was also offered the role she was overlooked for a few years before.  Kander and Ebb had their muse sing the songs so beautifully that it only makes the movie even more heartbreaking and exhilirating.  To think that this brilliant film was made for only 3 million dollars, Brando made that in one movie, later on we would have to suffer through big budget disasters like Moulin Rouge and Annie.  What Cabaret had was a well written movie based on the orginal Isherwood stories and a phenomenal cast and brilliant director.  I have seen this movie many times and highly recommend it to all.  This was perhaps the last of the greatest musicals ever made, for me it is the only one.  Winner of 8 Academy awards, including Best Director Bob Fosse, Best Actress Liza Minelli and Best Supporting Actor Joel Grey, you will live in a world of decadence and experience a real tour de force.
0800177975|5.0|PURE GENIUS!!!  This movie is clearly an exhasberated absurd joke that you either get or you don't.  I think most critics(as always) merely scratch the surface and are incapable of grasping such a concept.  It's lame and exaggerated and that's the whole friggin' point.  What I don't understand is how critics laugh at this yet take seriously films such as Armageddon, Face/Off, Con Air, etc.  These are the exact type of films that Last Action pokes fun at.  Being an extraordinary fan of those types of films I couldn't help but appreciate the satire of this flick. <br />\\" The bad puns, the hard rock...\\" <br />It's a very quotable film as well. <br />I find something new everytime as if I'm watching a Mel Brooks or Jim Abrahams film. <br />Absolute genius!! <br />Get it!!
0385510454|2.0|The Broker starts out with an interesting concept and throughout the story, made me want to go visit Italy.  However, the last 1/4 of the book was a total dud.  It's almost as if Grisham loses interest in his own tale and wraps it up in a boring, half-hearted way just to make the deadline with the publisher.  Also, the \\"chase\\" scene was not all that heartstopping.  If you want something to really excite you, read Patterson's Four Blind Mice.
B0001I55NS|2.0|The only reason I gave this limburger cheese of a film 2 stars was that you DID get to see Gerard Butler without his shirt on. I assume that is the only reason anybody would rent this film. He would have to pull a \\"full monty\\", though, to earn any more stars for this clunker, in which case I for one would happily rate it 5 stars and wear out the rewind button.  <br /> <br />     You can't blame the actors for bad script, bad plotting and bad directing. The final \\"surprise\\" at the end was telegraphed so that even a child could see it coming, which mine did. Paul Walker wasn't any worse an actor than the guy who played Dr. Lupin in Harry Potter -you could see HIS fate coming a mile away also. Walker's look was too \\"surfer dude\\" for the film, but in the end you felt sorry for ALL the actors involved. Donner ought to be spanked, but then again, maybe not, as it might give him ideas for even more dreadful movies.
0385510454|3.0|The novel story line starts promisingly but the story lose its steam halfway and ends without a thump. I am a bit disappointed with the story line. This novel is certainly not among the best works by Grisham.
B000005AYM|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT DEBUT BY THE WONDERFUL <br />BADU I LOVE IT.SHE'S TRULY TALENTED <br />AND APPRECIATED BY ME.KEEP BY THE <br />GOOD WORK ERYKAH!!!!!!!!!!!
B00003CXA6|4.0|I read Shaara's novel \\"Killer Angels\\" and viewed the dvd after completing the book.  The movie faithfully transfers Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning book to the screen.  The acting is suberb, especially the performance of Jeff Daniels as Lawrence Chamberlain.  Martin Sheen gives a riviting perforance as Robert E. Lee, although Sheen's height in the saddle works against him at times (it is said Robert E. Lee had a long torso which gave him the appearance of being much taller on horseback, Sheen is often the shortest person in certain scenes). The epic battle scenes are often just a backdrop to the drama created between the characters in this film.  Even if you are not a \\"war\\" movie buff per se, this is a must see movie for any American.  Yes it is long, but this allows it to be true to Shaara's vision.  Yes there are some scenes that are overly mellow dramatic, yes the use of the terms \\"good ground\\" or \\"high ground\\" become annoying at times and yes several of the beards look like the glue is coming loose (I had to slip those in), but the above instances do not detract from the power of this film. <br />One of the few movies that made me cry (I'm not afraid to admit it) in quite awhile.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|IT WAS GREAT I LOVED THE ALBUM <br />IS A MUST-HAVE.ALL THE TRACKS ARE <br />GREAT IN ALL HONESTLY.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|Rented this one the other day.  It does have a few laugh out loud funny moments....but they are kinda few and far inbetween.  It's worth checking out anyway.  One of the funniest things about this movie is one of the supporting charactors.  There is a girl that Pedro takes to the dance, and later Napoleon starts to date...its one of the daughters from that icky Meg Ryan movie where Meg plays a drunk and her husband is a pilot and he is trying to hold the family together, etc.  Forgot the name of it.  Oh yeah, its called \\"When a man loves a women.\\"  Anyway, one of the little girls in that movie, one that Meg kicks around when she is drunk, is in this movie, and of coarse has grown up a bit since then.  See if you can recognize her. <br /> <br />  If you liked something like \\"Welcome to the dollhouse\\" then you might like this one.  There is just a lot of really random crazy stuff happening in it.  The dance sequence at the student council presentations is crazee...probably the highlight of the movie.
B00007BHOE|5.0|This is by far the GREATEST live show i have ever seen, and i have seen 47 live shows by 21 bands, and 6 of those have been SLIPKNOT but non of those shows even came close to this. Here are my reviews of the songs: <br />1. People=S**t. 5/5 Great energy out of every memeber of the band, and a great way to kick off the show. <br />2. Liberate. 5/5 Another amazing performance, sounded better live than the studio version.  <br />3. Left Behind. 5/5 A little bit of a slower song but that didnt mean that it took away from the bands energy. <br />4. EEYORE. 3/5 Not one of my personal favourites but the band did look like they were enjoying themselves. <br />5. Disasterpiece. 5/5 One of the best performances of the night, a very fast song that kicks a$$ the whole way through and SLIPKNOT showed that well with there performance.  <br />6. Purity. 5/5 This sounded incredible <br /> <br />Sids solo. 2/5 I am not a dj so i am not really sure how to feel  <br />about this, it can get old fast <br /> <br />7. Gently. 1/5 The worst performance of the show, coreys vocals didnt sound to good on this one. <br /> <br />Joey's solo. 5/5 Being a drummer i can really respect Joey for what he did on this, he had some cool sounding double bass things in there. you have to see this to believe it. <br /> <br />8. Eyeless. 2/5 Never was that great of a song. <br />9. My Plague. 4/5 If you were to listen to  this and not watch it you would think it was the album you were listening to. <br />10. New Abortion. 4/5 Nice little talk before the song. <br />11. THE HERETIC ANTHEM. 10/5 The best performance of the night, there was pyro everywhere, the whole stage was on fire.  <br />12. Spit it out. 5/5 Amazing. <br />13. Wait and bleed. 4/5 a nice little song, corey sounded amazing. <br />14. (sic). 2/5 meh. <br />15. Surfacing. 6/5 Micks little solo that he does before the song sounded better than on the album, an amazing way to end the show. <br /> <br />
0425152251|5.0|One of my teachers in high school recommended this book to me.  I bought it but did not expect much, especially because I had very little \\"experience\\" in philosophy. <br /> <br />I finished the book in several days, and to say the least, I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br />From a literary standpoint, Gaarder's use of didactic fiction keeps things interesting, and the philosopher's points come across quite clear.  While some may find certain bits of the narrative boring, these \\"bits\\" culminate in a spectacular ending, which forced me to go back and look over several sections once more to see what I had missed. <br /> <br />More importantly, this book has changed the way I see the world and the way I interpret the events around me.  I have found myself questioning things more and more each day--not to criticize them but simply to understand them. <br /> <br />Seeing the progression of humanity through a philosophical perspective, has changed my outlook on the world (for the better, of course), and I recommend this book without reservation.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|the reason you can hear a solo in nothing else matters is because james is using a semi acoustic so he can just change the sound to electric and do the solo that way. i know that because i own one.
6305252521|5.0|Allow me to start by adding something to the previous review: a comment on the film's last shots. These shots (especially the very last one where 2 viewers wonder 'what else is on') are not just to close the film in a funny note. They're not scenes that the screenwriters just decided to include for fun. Far from that, they are a very bitter and pessimistic closure to the film, a portrayal of the reaction that the viewers (of the movie - not JUST the viewers IN the movie) will unfortunately have: after watching the movie they will just look for something else to 'consume', having missed the point they will casually look for another movie, another of what they just had: another movie to pass time. The majority will find it to be nothing but a movie about a reality tv show.   Those scenes are a bitter comment on how most people will just fail to grasp it's real message. And it actually prophesised what followed after the movie came out, which is not a big surprise, really.   Some people will actually manage to read between the lines, though. It's the same people that managed to understand the subject of movies like 'The Matrix' (not those who think it's about jesus) and 'Dark City' (not those who think it's about... aliens), the ones that understood what those movies tried to project. To those people all three of these movies talk about the same thing although adopting different storytelling methods to address it.    The Truman show is the one that deals with the subject in the most down-to-earth and accesible fashion: by looking more 'realistic'. By looking ordinary compared to the others. And yet it is so more obvious for it. Sadly, most people don't think when they watch movies unless they are told they must do so.   What is the common link between 'The Matrix', 'Dark City', and 'The Truman Show'? Could there be more than just that all three were filmed in Australia around the same time? Sadly (or perhaps not) there is absolutely no point in revealing what viewers should discover themselves - it will be no revelation they made themselves, that way - especially considering viewers that have yet to watch the film(s). Those people who watch and don't get the messages, they are simply not able or ready for them, hence those messages have absolutely no value in their present condition.     Therefore, the only thing i can do is just give some food for thought and hopefully provide some hints: Could those three movies be talking about the fabric of reality? Could they be talking about control? If so, what is that control expressed by? What is Christof in Truman's 'world' or 'reality'? Could he be God? Is there a pun intended by the choice of his name? What could the Architect be? What could the 'Strangers' symbolize? Is there a similarity between Truman's effort to cross the 'sea' confronting Cristof's will and Ulysses' journey confronting the Gods and more specifically Neptune? Could there be a connection between Truman and Ulysses? Could the sea be symbolizing something? Could there be a conection between that and the sea in 'Dark City'? What is Truman's real home? And where? How is he being kept a prisoner? By what values? Aren't those values... valuable? Could someone be abusing them? How are Anderson (Matrix) and Murdock (Dark City) kept prisoners in their cases? What makes them want to escape? If Truman's name is not an accidental choice then could there be meaning in the names Anderson (hint: no, it does not mean son of man - there is NO greek word analogy there except for those who desperately need to put one there - could it simply mean what it SOUNDS?) and Murdock (hint: who was Marduk and what did he do)?  Could those names be significant in each respective movie? How? Could there be a connection between the viewers in the 'Truman Show', the ones plugged into the matrix and the citizens of 'Dark City? What could be the connection between the methods used in all three cases? Could there be a connection with the viewers/humans/citizens OUTSIDE the films? What are the means by which each 'reality' is maintained?     There are so much more (especially if one steps into the metaphysical symbolism in each film) but this is only intented to stir your interest and your thinking process...    I hope you have a good and creative time...    P.S.: As a final thought... Could there be a connection between this film and 'The Dead Poets Society' that happen to have the same director? What was THAT film REALLY about?
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is not only Green Day's best work yet, but to me,ranks in the legendary album status. You might scoff at this, but once you listen to the whole album from start to finish (at least 10 times) you will agree. BUY IT! <br />
0767834739|4.0|I can't remember a time when I didn't love Resident Evil.  No other series of video games can even come close to matching the complexity of the story behind RE.  For years, I thought that an RE movie would be truly awesome, and lo and behold, they made one.  Although none of the original characters were involved, I still relished every second of it, and when I heard there was going to be an RE2 movie, I was estatic. <br />Now, don't get me wrong.  The visuals, the costumes, the characters, the fighting...all are truly awesome in the movie.  There are plenty of surprises, lots of zombies, and even some comic relief.  All in all, the movie itself was quite well done. My issue is with the plot itself. <br />As all of you hardcore RE fans know, 'Nemesis' is the title, and the subject, of the 3rd RE game.  The second RE game does deal with the scientist's missing daughter, and with a reporter, but the similarity ends there. RE2 (the videogame) follows Leon's and Claire's seperate stories as they try to escape the city: Claire tries to rescue the scientist's daughter, and Leon and the reporter are looking for the G-virus, the new and updated version of the T-virus. Also, the second game brings in more enemies and all kinds of things that would have made for an excellent movie. <br />I'm thrilled that a third movie is being made, and I hope it follows RE:Code Veronica a little more closely than \\"Apocalypse\\" followed RE2.  \\"Apocalypse\\" is still an awesome movie, but fans, be ye warned: the plot might make you a bit angry.
B00005GL0N|5.0|This record is widely misunderstood by fans.  How often must one hear it denigrated for its dissimilarity to A HARD DAY'S NIGHT and HELP!, and The Beatles themselves taken to task for their failure to live up to some supposed standard of quality unknown to anyone at the time?  Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't AHDN essentially the all-new & original soundtrack of a film musical? Likewise HELP!? So then, of course this record would not be as likely to resemble those two as much as the earlier ones.  This is not rocket science.<br /><br />And how tiresome to have to hear over and over again the rote regurgitation of the same supposed inside information that The Beatles were tired, weary, under-the-gun etc.  Please, spare me.  BEATLES FOR SALE is not, nor was it intended to be, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT.  A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is Beatlemania; BEATLES FOR SALE is Hamburg - and it's unlike all their other albums.<br /><br />The overwhelming presence here is John Lennon, and the prevailing working method of the group is: John strums a rock 'n roll, country, or pop tune and the others play along.  That would in fact always be John's principal approach to \\"orchestration\\", although on later albums there would be enough creative input by Paul, who thought through and worked out music differently, to mask it somewhat and allow John to seem more complex than he really was.<br /><br />BEATLES FOR SALE is just like a live show, and the Hamburg Beatles' live shows were always constructed around the standard I IV V blues-rock songs which were the staple of their idols of the previous decade - Elvis, Buddy Holly, Gene Vincent et al. (Interestingly enough, Lennon and McCartney would never write such songs during their career as Beatles but they never tired of playing them, and used them as departure points for their own creative expressions - \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\", \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" and \\"Day Tripper\\" being prime examples.)  For this album the band covers four such songs: \\"Rock and Roll Music\\", the medley \\"Kansas City\\"/\\"Hey Hey Hey Hey\\", \\"Honey Don't\\", and \\"Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby\\" which features 36 bars of guitar soloing from George and which appropriately closes the \\"show\\".  Each of the \\"boys\\" sings one of them.  Only one...<br /><br />Ergo one of the more persistently voiced criticisms of BEATLES FOR SALE - that the group erred in choosing to include \\"Mr. Moonlight\\" rather than the contemporaneously recorded \\"Leave My Kitten Alone\\" - is nonsense.  There simply was no such choice.  The actual choice, as it were, concerned which of the two I IV V songs sung by John they would use - \\"Kitten\\" or \\"Rock and Roll Music\\".  Can anyone doubt that they chose right?  As for \\"Mr. Moonlight\\", it had been a go all along, and for good reason.  Not only was it a fab vocal performance by John, who is in as good a voice here as he would ever be, but also this: all the Beatles loved \\"exotica\\", which was huge through the late '50s and early '60s, and this song allowed them to indulge their taste for different sounds with the so-called \\"Polynesian\\" harmony, lounge organ and tympani, just as \\"And I Love Her\\", with its classical guitar and claves, had on the previous album.<br /><br />As on A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, Paul's songs are at a bare minimum, and the first, in keeping with their Hamburg theme, is one of his earliest: the very sweet and prescient \\"I'll Follow the Sun\\".  The other, \\"What You're Doing\\", with its drum intro that sounds like something he coaxed out of Ringo, is, I've always felt, one of the most under-appreciated in the Fab Four's catalogue.<br /><br />If there is anything at all weak in this album, I would say it's that some of George's fills sound too quickly settled upon.  In the future Paul would come to exercise more authority over George, offering \\"suggestions\\" as he earlier had with Stuart.<br /><br />All in all, taken in the proper spirit, this is a wonderful album!  That it's their most accessible and least intellectually challengingin no way diminishes its lasting value as a testament to the era in which they were musically christened, and to their own fabulous and astonishing charm as performers.
B000065V1V|5.0|This is as good as any Bowie classic album.   <br /> <br />A couple of stand out tracks make it worth the spend alone, being \\"I would be your slave\\" and the awesome guitar work on \\"Slow burn\\". <br /> <br />You like Bowie - You'll like this.
B00005JNEW|4.0|The most immediate comparison for this film has to be the sports classic \\"Hoosiers.\\"  As with that film, \\"Friday Night Lights\\" pits the littles guys against the seemingly undefeatable juggernaut.  The players persevere through personal problems, fanatical community pressures, and come together with courage in their collective hearts.  While there are a few predictable moments most of the film somehow remains fresh throughout regardless of the fact that this type of film has all been done before.  By the end of the film I really didn't know if they were going to win the State Championship or not.  The result was up in the air, the suspense and tension in the film at its peak, which made for a much more satisfying experience.  If there is one glaring negative about the film it is all the hand-held cinematography.  I swear I saw the same type of shot about twenty times: a hand-held camera pans side-to-side, catches an image, then rapidly zooms in for a close-up.  It really didn't matter what was in the center of the picture, either.  At one point it is a large bus carrying the student atheletes, another is an exhausted player covered in sweat, etc.  It was done too often to remain kinetic.  I know the director wanted the audience to feel like they were there when it all transpired, but at some point hand-held photography becomes plain annoying.  However, this only takes a little away from the overall effect of this solid, often nostalgic sports film.  I highly recommend this film for anyone who enjoyed playing High School Football.  For the rest of us, it is an otherwise entertaining romp into the world of Texas Football.  I lived in Texas for six years and the fans down there really do love their Football.  Later.
B00006M183|5.0|Ten, Vs and Vitolagy are considered Pearl Jams best albums, because that was when the ridiculous grunge genre was thriving and it was also their most popular and mainstream compared with everything that was released after Viotlagy. <br /> <br />To be honest I think their first three albums, have their moments but I also think that they are terrible albums and by far their worst. I think people look at records and rate them as their best because how popular they are, instead of looking at them musically. <br /> <br />I think you'll find that albums that are commercial disastors are always musically brilliant. I can tell you this much, commercialisation kills music. <br /> <br />An exception to this is Oasis who were in a class of their own, and all they care about is rock'n roll, are still doing what they feel like. U2 on the other hand have blown it. <br /> <br />Pearl Jams best albums start from No Code onwards, and now we have their best, Riot Act is a varied and brilliant album. <br /> <br />It might take a few listens to fully appreciate but it is certainly Pearl Jams bets album, and an enemy to the mainstream of music - I think its time more people realised that this is a good thing. <br />
B000286RNY|1.0|Most are rating this movie very highly. Anyone who dares to rate it poorly seems to be getting very poor reactions. There is both the U.S. theatrical version and the original version. The original version I liked better. The movie is well done visually. I just don't care for the silliness. I couldn't get past eighteen minutes of watching the film. Normally, I have a lot of patience, and I have been known to sit through a film for almost two hours, which I wasn't enjoying that much, to have it turn around with an ending that saved the whole movie for me. With this one, I don't care. For those of you who like silly movies--go for it. It's good as far as silly movies go. As for myself, I'd rather spend my time watching something else.
B000000W8C|3.0|The Verve are a great band with great potential, but this album is just drowned in noise, its terrible. <br /> <br />When you listen to it you you realise that the music is so badly produced, that your ears are focussing on the sheer volume of the music instead of the actual music. <br /> <br />Great band, but a badly produced album.
B000002AP1|4.0|From the violent slashing guitar of Search & Destroy to the intense finale Death Trip there is not a bad moment in this seminal Detroit sludgefest. The original Bowie mix gets 5 stars in my book, and this one gets 4, for a main reason: Iggy's remix takes a bit of the all-important danger out of the music. To my ears, it sounds a bit more bass heavy and (maybe because I've been hearing the old mix for so long) muffled. For an example find the old mix, put on the title track and wait for James Williamson's first guitar solo. The Bowie mix can rip your head off at high volume, while Ig's mix has it a bit more buried. Also Iggy brought more of the experimental stuff up higher in the mix, such as the constant one note piano drone in Gimme Danger that I feel detracts a bit from the moving acoustic guitar passage. These are minor rants, but, even though I have both mixes on CD, I always listen to the original Bowie mix. If I had to go to a deserted island, and only had the option of the Iggy remix, it would still go with me, because it is still one of the cornerstones of my music collection!!!

0739309013|5.0|I adored this book.  The narration by Michael Beck was terrific.  I loved the descriptions and eccentricities of the small town characters.  I can somewhat understand why Grisham readers are a little disappointed, as it is not his usual legal thriller, but I just loved it anyway.  It was charming and funny, and, again, the narration was great.
B000001FZK|5.0|Yes, wonderful sounds to soak in. Hollis is a great singer, even if I don't listen to what he's singing.  How 'bout that guitar playing in After the Flood that has been compared to the sound of a modem dialing... squealing? I think this is melancholy music but it's VERY COOL!
B00005AAFS|5.0|This album is my favorite of any type. I have this album since 2001 and I can't get tired of hear it, it's a great piece of art. From the beginning you know it. <br /> <br />Mein Herz Brennt 5/5: At first I didn't like the song, but now that I understand it it's awesome. Starts slow but it grows. <br /> <br />Links 2-3-4 5/5: A military song that demonstrate the power of Rammstein to write. <br /> <br />Sonne 5/5: The first single of this album. A very powerful song with the contrast of the female voice on the chorus (it's not a real female voice, it's created with the keyboards). <br /> <br />Ich Will 5/5: The most Powerful song in this album, and the interaction with the crowd is something new in Rammstein. <br /> <br />Feuer Frei! 5/5: Starts slow, a bit calm but then crap!!! A punch to the face. An excellent song. <br /> <br />Mutter 5/5: I stand up and applaude. This is what you call greatness. A very appealing song and the orchestra is amazing. <br /> <br />Spieluhr 5/5: A good song with excellent choruses, and the girl voice fits in perfectly. <br /> <br />Zwitter 4/5: Funny song but it's a bit too long at the end plus the fading is something I never liked. <br /> <br />Rein Raus 4/5: Good song but is not the best. <br /> <br />Adios 5/5: I think this is the best song in this album. Excellent guitar riff and a very good rythm guitar. <br /> <br />Nebel 5/5: The most beautiful of the album, is the best way to close the album. <br /> <br />I hope you get this album 'cause really is pure art. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This album is the best slipknot album of them all.  I am a huge slipknot fan and originally got big into them when I first heard \\"Left Behind\\".  I bought IOWA just for that song and that's when I started to get more into the metal side of rock.  My friends kept on telling me to get their self-titled disc so I did and I loved that one too. <br /> <br />Now Volume 3: The Subliminal Verses comes along and it's their best yet.  If all you like is metal then you won't LOVE the album but I'm sure you won't mind it.  If you appreciate good talent when you hear it then this album is for you.  The drums in The Blister Exists are amazing, you still get the oldschool hardcore sounds of slipknot in Three Nil, Welcome, and Pulse of the Maggots, you get to see the softer and amazing side of Slipknot with Circle and Vermilion Pt. 2, and then there is just the pure rock with Duality, Before I Forget, The Nameless, and Opium of the People (which is my favorite song on the album). <br /> <br />I haven't been able to see them in concert yet but I've already gotten tickets to see them on the Subliminal Verses World Tour with Lamb Of God and Shadows Fall and I can't wait.  Stay (sic)!!
B000084T18|5.0|This is THE BEST album in the hip hop industry since Tupac left us all (R.I.P.). 50 Cent has the beats going for him, great lyrics, and the album has good flow. G-UNIT is going to rule the industry if Buck and Banks are as good as this! GG-GG-GG-Unit!
1587990717|5.0|I have been a derivatives trader on Wall Street since before they were called derivatives. Nassim Taleb has presented non-trivial, fundamental insights that should inform every market participant's thinking.  <br />     Yes, there are more comprehensive books just about probability. Yes, there are wonderful books just about the stock market. Yes, there are very technical works about trading options (Taleb's Dynamic Hedging remains the best). This book is not a replacement but an introduction. A critical introduction that must shape a trader's (and an investor's) thinking. <br />     But it's more than that. Taleb sees the markets with their diverse human participants as a microcosm of life. And he has observed that microcosm not from the comfort of Descartes' armchair but in the maelstrom of the trading floor. Anyone interested in behavioral economics or just human behavior should find this book enormously instructive. <br />     I'm moved to offer this review because I've paged through the hundreds of reviews this book has already attracted (in itself remarkable). I note the anonymous contributors whose style and content seem to repeat in multiple reviews. Some seem more animated by Taleb's persona than by his ideas. I must say that I find his irreverence charming and stimulating; the squeamish reader who may have his sensibilities offended will surely want to suspend such reactions in favor of the stimulating ideas herein. <br />     Full disclosure: I've met and traded with Taleb. That's what led me to purchase Dynamic Hedging. After that, I was hooked. I hope Fooled by Randomness is only one of a long series of works about economics, finance, and life.
B0002IU988|3.0|If anyone wants to hear Myles Kennedy at his finest, check out Mayfield Four -\\"Fallout\\". That cd is amazing, and his voice on the song Suckerpunch is awesome! He has a range that I haven't heard since Freddy Mercury of Queen. I'm glad he's playing with people that will get him the recognition he deserves.
B00006AW2F|3.0|Curiosity value wins this unapproved collection its third star by the skin of its teeth.<br /><br />The Stones' contract with Decca Records ended on 31 July 1970 and they formed their own label, Rolling Stones Records, for new product beginning with Brown Sugar and the Sticky Fingers album. Their former label unsurprisingly continued to release what they had in the vaults, both previously released and otherwise, beginning with the compilation Stone Age, timed to coincide with the release of Sticky Fingers, and then with others such as Gimme Shelter, Hot Rocks 1964-1971, Milestones, Rock'n'Rolling Stones, More Hot Rocks (Big Hits And Fazed Cookies), and, aptly, No Stone Unturned.<br /><br />Metamorphosis followed in 1975 with poetical sleeve notes by Andrew Oldham promising \\"songs and stars to take you back/Some old some new, some gone, some due...\\" and offering thanks to \\"Jimmy Page, John McLaughlin, Phil Spector, Jack Nitzsche, Gene Pitney, John Paul Jones, Joe Morrett, Art Greenslade, Messrs Leander and Whittaker, Tony Hicks, Graham Nash, Dave Hassinger, Glyn Johns, Jimmy Miller, and all those we remember had it on the rocks, but forgot the rock they got off on.\\"<br /><br />There was little clue as to the provenance of what was on offer except that they all dated from their Decca period (London label in America). To tie in with the release, one track had been released as a single, I Don't Know Why, a stirring cover of a relatively obscure Stevie Wonder single from 1969 which had been flipped in favour of the more popular My Cherie Amour. It may be apocryphal that the Stones' rendition was being recorded on exactly 3 July 1969 when a phone call interrupted the session with the news of Brian Jones' death by drowning. He had quit the band less than a month earlier, and Mick Taylor had taken his place in the band. <br /><br />The B-side was an unknown Jagger/Richards song called Try A Little Harder, which they had recorded as a publisher's demo on 13 February 1964 at Regent Sound, with session musicians replacing the rest of the Stones. Mick and Keith did a lot of these in the sixties, in a bid to establish themselves as songwriters in their own right, much as Lennon/McCartney had, by offering unrecorded new songs to other acts.<br /><br />Of the first 9 songs on Metamorphosis, 7 seem to be more publisher's demos created by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, probably recorded with Arthur Greenslade, Mike Leander and David Whittaker, between 1964 and 1966, with a couple of the Hollies adding back-up vocals.<br /><br />The first of these is Out Of Time, with the arrangement as used by Chris Farlowe on the released version, which of course was a huge hit for him in 1966. The version here, recorded from 27 April 1966, was also extracted as a single in September 1975. It flopped in the UK and reached no. 45 in the States. Sleepy City (September 1964) was recorded by the Mighty Avengers; We're Wasting Time (September 1964) by Jimmy Tarbuck; Each And Every Day Of The Year (September 1964) for The Thee; Some Things Just Stick In Your Mind (February 1964) for Dick and Deedee and later recorded by Vashti; I'd Much Rather Be With The Boys (February 1965) for the Toggery Five. <br /><br />The two exceptions are a Rolling Stones cover of Chuck Berry's Don't Lie To Me (the composer credits are wrong, and those reviewers who think it was on their first British EP are mistaken; that was Bye Bye Johnny), recorded 12 May 1964 with Ian Stewart on piano, the same day they recorded Congratulations; and a version of Heart Of Stone that is quite a lot sweeter and more poppy than the original American single included on Out Of Our Heads, and has pedal steel guitar and chorus. The basic track for this was recorded 21-23 July 1964 with Mick Jagger being the only Stone involved, suggesting that this Jagger/Richards song was originally intended for someone else.<br /><br />The final six selections all sound like Rolling Stones outtakes, probably from sessions for the later Decca albums Between The Buttons, Beggar's Banquet and Let It Bleed. Collector's of hen's teeth should note that Downtown Suzie is an almost unique Stones-period Bill Wyman composition.<br /><br />Memo From Turner was released as a single in a different version from the film Performance credited to Mick Jagger, that featured Ry Cooder's bottleneck guitar, so it is fascinating to hear this slightly later version by the Stones, recorded 17 November 1968, although it is inferior. Finally, the last track, I'm Going Down, has what sounds like Bobby Keyes on saxophone, and may date from early Sticky Fingers sessions in 1970 as it would not sound out of place on that album.

B000002LBH|5.0|This is probably the best Smiths compilation available - with 'Hatful of Hollow' a close second. It covers most of the Smiths hits - with the exception of there two best albums - 'Meat is Murder' and 'the Queen is Dead' - but it is a good summary of their early singles and is a nice introduction to the band.
B00064MW6A|1.0|This film version based on one of Batman's most revered supporting characters bears little resemblance to the slinky, smart, and sophisticated character that comic fans have read for years, and that's not even half of it.  Even when Catwoman was in pre-production, it was a forgone conclusion that this would be an absolute bomb.  Directed by french director Pitof, the film has no real visual flair besides the very sexy Halle Berry strutting around with hardly any clothes on, and there are quite a number of plain old bad CGI shots.  Sharon Stone gives her most wooden performance in her career, and other cast members Benjamin Bratt and Frances Conroy are wasted.  Not to mention, this movie has no original idea anywhere in it.  The tagline of the film trailers proclaimed, \\"a cat can bring a soul back to the world of the living to make the wrong things right\\".  Gee, anyone else remember the Crow?  If you're a fan of Berry, this is worth watching to see her gorgeous body in action, but if you are going to watch this strictly for that, your best bet is to fast forward through the rest of the film.  Other than that, this isn't even worth seeing, and is undoubtadly one of the worst comic to film adaptations of all time.
B00005JN0T|5.0|I really like this movie and I have liked it since I saw it in the theatre when it came out. It is your typical Will Smith action movie. Funny, Action Packed, Bad Dialouge...But looking past all that, this truly is a great action film. And, the special effects are great. When a movie like \\"Scooby-Doo\\" with horrible effects comes out, the effects are always what is brought up. I haven't even heard anyone mention the effects and they truly are marvelous. The movie is funnier than the second <br />\\"Men in Black\\" movie too I might add with a joke with Will Smith sneezing and then saying \\"Oh, i'm sorry. I'm allergic to bull****\\" This may not seem funny to a lot of people but I found it hilarious. Smith plays Del Spooner. Spooner, is a paranoid homicide detective that doesn't trust any kind of robot. And when a scientist dies of an apparent suicide, Spooner suspects a robot named Sonny,who seems unique in comparison to his fellow robots. Besides the police chief, another person who thinks Spooner is crazy is Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan, \\"The Recruit\\"). This movie is truly taken for granted, I put it on my Top 10 List, that's how much I liked it. It wasn't at number 1 or anything but still... The only problem I had with the film was the dialouge. Some of it is just plain stupid and bad... <br />The lines and the emotion expressed while delivering the lines are just cheesy. Why give it 5 stars then? Cause, it is truly a brilliant film, the suspense, action, and comedy is carefully drawn out. It's terrific. A+.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|Back in 1996, wannabe filmmaker Kerry Conran was holed up in his small Sherman Oaks apartment hunched over his Apple computer incessantly rendering segments and scenes for a trailer of an epic movie that only existed in his head.  Two years later he had an art deco tinged, vintage-looking six minute black and white teaser that would become SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW (Paramount).<br /><br />A screenplay was begun after producer John Avnet saw that short film in 1998 and committed to making Kevin's big screen vision a reality.  Two years later, shooting began in London with Kevin directing. Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie acted out every digitally storyboarded scene on a bare, blue stage.  All the globe trotting locations and huge aerial and underwater action set pieces were then computer designed with the actors seamlessly inserted.<br /><br />I mention these things because the art of this film is at least as important as the story. Set in the late 1930s, giant robots invade New York City and perky reporter Paltrow alerts old lover Joe \\"Sky Captain\\" Sullivan (Jude Law).  Their daunting task is to figure out who's behind this attack and stop a conspiracy to destroy civilization in order to save the planet.  An idea that resonates on some level today.<br /><br />The exquisitely beautiful, period perfect, richly detailed results didn't connect to the full audience potential this breathtaking breakthrough film deserves.<br /><br />Extras include three informative featurettes on the art and making of this film and there are two superb commentaries.  One from the filmmakers and a lone producer commentary from Avnet that should be the model for all future producer commentaries.<br /><br />This DVD is highly recommended.<br /><br />Maybe there will be a two disc extended edition that includes the finished version of the important deleted scenes and a separate disc that actualy shows the digital artists at work creating the astonishingly detailed, beautifully executed visuals that look straight out of the 30s.detailed, beautifully executed visuals that look straight out of the 30s. <br />
0385510454|4.0|Im not sure how to rate this book I liked it but it never really went anywhere. The story seemed so promising but turned out to be a bit slow with alot of Italian spread throughout. I was always wondering is this thing about to get good and never did. The scenery makes me want to go to Italy cause its described so beautifully. You never really found out why the hits were called off and we didnt hear anything from Tin Tin? This was by far not my favorite Grisham. I felt as if his last book was better. A decent Grisham book but not his best in my opinion.
B0006HC0I2|5.0|The great Jean Gabin is world weary, elegant, elder crime king pin Max in Jacques Becker's understated 1954 TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI (Criterion).<br /><br />The title literally translates \\"Hands off my loot!\\" But it's all about the details and relationships that are peripheral to the aftermath of big bullion heist that Max has just pulled off.  His plan is to retire with his pretty young girlfriend, but when long time not so smart partner Riton brags to his two timing moll Josy (Jeanne Moreau), Max is sucked back into the world he helped create and can never leave.<br /><br />Becker died in obscurity in 1960, but over time his reputation has grown.  This once forgotten gem is now recognized as a near perfect touchstone of the crime genre and it looks brand new in pristine black and white.<br /><br />Extras include interviews and essays and a TV documentary.  It would be nice if the subtitles were in yellow, but that is a small complaint for a terrific film.
B00005RDRO|5.0|I have never laughed so hard at something so stupid in all my life.  Where have movies like this gone.  Proof that a good movie starts with good writing.  Ironic since it is a spoof movie that makes fun of literary characters.  The actors look like they are having fun too.  watch for a young James Cromwell playing a driver/servant.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|First off, this would've been better as a CD/DVD combo pack with \\"Welcome to the Videos\\" (and the DVD should've had more live footage for songs like \\"Civil War\\" which they did at Farm Aid).  <br /> <br />Second, the packaging and liner notes leave a lot to be desired.  <br />The band had zero involvement in putting this one together. Slash and Axl actually came together against the label on this one...  <br /> <br />Third, GnR have enough live and rare material to put out a box set's worth of quality material.  <br /> <br />As far as the songs go, the first 2 are from \\"Appetite For Destruction\\", one of the greatest rock albums EVER. \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" was also from Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry's \\"Dead Pool\\" and in the film, Jim Carrey (long before \\"In Living Color\\")is seen singing to it (also worth checking out for the GnR cameo as well as Patricia Clarkson and Liam Neeson starring in it...).  <br />Still a great rock song.  <br /> <br />\\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" follows next with the memorable (or annoying) intro that was all over the radio in the late 80s and was what really broke them into the mainstream.   <br /> <br />The next song comes from the \\"Lies\\" EP (and a re-release of their first EP \\"Live Like a Suicide\\"), \\"Patience\\", also a huge hit for the group. Reminds me of early 70s Rod Stewart before he wondered if he was sexy....  <br /> <br />and then back to \\"Appetite\\" with \\"Paradise City\\". I can picture Beavis and Butthead (and bad karaoke versions) singing this one...  <br />  <br />the biggest disappointment for me was that there weren't enough songs from \\"Appetite\\" on here, but they're sticking to the \\"hits\\".  <br /> <br />Next on the list is classic Bob Dylan singalong \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\" (for the Days of Thunder soundtrack before it wound up on \\"Use Your Illusion\\") By far, the best version is the live version, but this one's pretty good.  <br />  <br />And then, in my opinion, one of the greatest GnR songs, \\"Civil War\\", also one that was on another CD before \\"Use Your Illusion\\" (\\"Nobody's Child: Romanian Angel Appeal\\" compiled by George Harrison), which was their most political song.  <br />  <br />The next 5 tracks fill out \\"Use Your Illusion\\", starting with  <br />the hit song from \\"Terminator 2\\" called \\"You Could Be Mine\\", and then following it up with \\"Don't Cry\\" which the late Shannon Hoon of Blind Melon sings on. Haunting in retrospect.  <br /> <br />The epic \\"November Rain\\" is next, and I think represents the pinnacle of what GnR were at the time, but the song is pulled off well without managing to go overboard (as some of the other songs did off those albums).  <br />  <br />Paul McCartney's \\"Live and Let Die\\" is a really cool cover, and then \\"Yesterdays\\" which in a way was symbolizing the end of an era at the time.  <br /> <br />The next 2 were from their Bowie-like \\"Pinups\\" called \\"The Spaghetti Incident?\\", one the classic punk song \\"Ain't It Fun\\" and oldie \\"Since I Don't Have You\\". I actually would've preferred they would have gone with the Nazareth \\"Hair of the Dog\\" cover which was played more on the radio at the time.   <br /> <br />Finally, they end it with the song from \\"Interview with the Vampire\\", the Stones' \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" which is pretty good (although \\"Jumpin Jack Flash\\" had been a well known cover they did).   <br />   <br />Overall, the songs have held up well and because at the time they were already tipping their hat to 70s hard rock, it still sounds fresh almost 20 years later.  <br /> <br />I still think \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" should be picked up over this one, and considering it came out around the same time as U2's \\"Joshua Tree\\", The Pixies' \\"Surfer Rosa\\" and \\"Doolittle\\", Sonic Youth's \\"Daydream Nation\\" and Jane's Addiction's \\"Nothing's Shocking\\",The Beastie Boys' \\"Paul's Boutique\\", NWA's \\"Straight Outta Compton\\", Ministry's \\"Land of Rape and Honey\\"/\\"A Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste\\" and Public Enemy's \\"It Takes a Nation of Millions\\" what would happen in musicin the 90s to today can be traced back to this fertile time (contrary to what people think happened in '91) in music when changes were happening.  <br />
B00008VGL6|1.0|OK, perhaps I'm a little too nostalgic, but at the mention of the words Depeche Mode, Martin Gore, Dave Gahan, or anything having to do with Depeche Mode, I immediately recall their dark late 80s/early 90s signature sound. I simply can't shake it out of my system. With enough said, I expected this CD to sound similar to Martin's Counterfeit 1 album from 1990. Turns out I had set myself up for quite a disappointment. Counterfeit 2 to me is too mellow, flat, and simply depressing. His voice isn't even the same.  So maybe that was 15 years ago, and artists are supposed to grow and all, but that still doesn't keep me from wishing that the members of DM would stop putting out that lame stuff and got back to making music the way they used to.
B0002KVUMK|5.0|When I first saw the trailers for Van Helsing I was not very impressed with what I saw; it seemed overloaded with action and had no story.  Out of curiosity, I saw the film and enjoyed it.  I think that this is a film that one better appreciates after viewed more than once.     The film is a hi-tech version of the old Universal movies from the 1940's that featured Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolfman; such films as The House of Dracula and The House of Frankenstein.  Much of the criticism of the film that I have read ignores that it is a parody of horror films, and meant to be fun.      Van Helsing has the loudest soundtrack that I have yet hear with a lot of loud drum pounding.  The story is flimsy: monster killed who has no memory set out to kill Dracula in Transylvania.  But this is not a movie that was put out so we could measure it for credibility: it is two hours of entertainment: it is a movie that does not pretend to be anything but entertainment.  It is not meant to be a classic horror tale nor a comic book.    Hugh Jackman is perfect as Van Helsing.  I don't think that another actor could create the same presence. Kate Beckinsale is good as Anna Valerious even if her accent sometimes seems forced.  It was interesting to see David Wenham as Carl after his role as Fairimir.  He brings off the part nicely, even if it takes a little to get used to seeing him as a frisky friar.  An equally interesting part is Shuler Hensley as the Frankenstein monster, who makes the creature into a credible and sympathetic personality despite the heavy makeup.  As for Richard Roxburgh as Dracula, it took a little while before I could see him in the role.  He may not be as obviously sinister as some vampires but he has a menace that fills the role when required.  The Brides are well cast and the special effects when they are flying are probably the most spectacular of the film.  Kevin O'Conner, who as Benny in The Mummy, is equally good as Igor.  His half-weary delivery of theline \\"Yes, Master\\" is a comic part of the movie.  And Samuel West, in the small role of  Dr. Victor Frankenstein, does a good imitation of Colin Clive saying \\"It's alive! It's alive!\\"    So, I can recommend Van Helsing for the unashamed piece of entertainment that it is.  Why analyze such a movie? The story of bringing to life unborn vampire offspring is patently fatuous.  What rules does a movie have to follow just to entertain you?  If you are fast forwarding or are moaning that your favorite monsters are being \\"misinterpreted\\" you have missed the point.  This is a movie to sit back and watch for the ride not fault it for something it was never intended to be.
0780624890|4.0|The film brings to the screen the story of Blade, a vampire hunter, himself a human-vampire hybrid in which he must prevent the resurrection the long forgotten vampire Blood God.  It is a highly entertaining, action-packed adventure combining significant elements of horror.  <br />Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances well, though the choice for lead actress was poor at best. Though she is a Halle Berry type (which is definitely a plus) this film does not seem to be her thing, especially when she does not present/show her \\"Halle Berry qualities.\\" Moreover, she does overdo it with her character's fearless/tough attitude; it gets tiring after a while, not to mention totally unrealistic (she is supposed to be a doctor for crying out loud, not G.I. Jane!!!).  Subsequently, she is not convincing in her role.   <br />In addition, there are faults with the plot such as how did Frost manage to stage a coup d'etat, and a successful one at that, against the whole vampire Pureblood council, especially when he is supposed to be a half-breed??? <br />Not to mention the ease with witch he plays around with Purebloods! <br />Furthermore, what was the point of the Bob Marley look-alike?  To show that there are Jamaican vampires?    <br />Aside from that, the concept, the setting, the special effects, the MUSIC, and the swordfights are all EXCELLENT!  Blade is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment. <br />

B00000JLWW|4.0|With renewed interest in this ship & the film, with a touring \\"Titanic\\" exhibit currently in Philadelphia ... I am glued once again to the smaller screen with James Cameron's \\"Titanic.\\"  8 years later, and I kind of thought this then - The script is the weakest link in what is otherwise his greatest achievement.  The script in many places is too juvenile and too \\"modern 1997.\\"  I doubt a young man in 1912 would be stating lines like \\"You're stupid Rose. You're stupid!\\"  So, even though the script lacks ... I'm just mesmerized by all the other great details that were authentically recreated.  The score, and the performances by the primary list of characters continue to hold up! <br /> <br />I am most surprised in this day and age (2005) ... that this is the only issue ... a \\"1999\\" DVD release with absolutely no behind-the-scenes extras, for as massive as this film is.  With the 10th anniversary of this film just 2 years away ... I do hope James Cameron takes the time to show us (through a new DVD issue) the incredible behind the scenes footage, like recreating the massive 882 foot Titanic at it's 9/10s scale in Rosarito Beach, Baja California.  I can only imagine the massive amount of extras a new DVD release could have. <br /> <br />In the meantime ... this 1999 DVD issue will have to do.  So, I hope a second \\"Special Edition\\" DVD is in the works.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|After hearing a lot of hype about this movie, I had to see it and I did not like it.  It is a dull comedy with jokes that aren't really that funny. The main character is a dork who really does nothing but draw mythical creatures.  He makes 2 friends, a shy girl and a Mexican who barely talks english. Him and the mexican try to get dates for a dance and then run against the popular girl in school for class president.  After a funny, and very good dance (the funniest part in the movie)  by Napoleon the school loves it, but they never shows if they won or not.  Napoleon then at the end starts to date the shy girl and his dorky brother who meets a sexy black woman on the internet gets married to her after she has him dressing like a gangsta and the movie ends.  No real point to the movie and I'd avoid it.

B000000OQY|5.0|Imagine a band being the biggest thing in rock after only 1 major multy-Platnium album. That was Guns N Roses when they released this album.There was no big promotion for this album after all it was sorta a re-release of some older and B-Side material.This album proved to be one of the best and most rareest releases of the generation.The songs are unforgetable,raw, soulful, and sometimes shocking. Even today this album would be taboo if just released. I cannot think of a better demo-style record than this one, ever. The best songs are the acoustic ones \\"Patience\\", \\"One n a Million\\" just to name a few. The songs lyrical content is about sex, drugs, girlfriends, love,and peace of mind. or to hear the band say it \\"Guess I needed some time to get away/I needed some peace of mind/some peace of mind that'll stay/so I thumbed it down to six and LA/Maybe your greyhound could be my way..... <br />If you want to experience a album that is true in form, a album that has not been \\"produced\\" just real melodic, captivating rock n roll than this is it.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|Michael Mann has filmed a good nail biter with Collateral.  It has all the earmarks of post-Hitchcock thrillers. The plot is preposterous, but it is executed with 21st Century technical expertise.  Therefore, the viewer is so engaged with the visual extravaganza, he does not care that Tom Cruise essentially is impersonating Arnold's Terminator.  Cruise is a short man. The idea that he's a cool killer for some reason made me notice his eternal adolescent size.  In Easy Money he became the Cool Tom we see in Rain Man, Mission Impossible etc, but with gray hair, he resembles Tom with gray hair.  The kid doesn't have a lot of range, but Clark Gable didn't either. <br /> <br />The big surprise in Collateral is Jamie Foxx.  I have no idea how these comedians turned sitcom boobs can suddenly out act Tom Cruise.  Again, I'm not sure this is a big deal, but Jamie does steal the show.  He's a nice guy stuck in a bad job with a talkie mother. His dreams are not realized because of his own inertia. The Cruise killer prods Jamie to aggressive actions he would have never taken without the threat of death.  Therefore his personality morphs, which is more than I can say for Cruise's character. <br /> <br />LA at night is a strange alien city in Mann's vision.  Wandering the streets are the good and the bad in total isolation from each other.  Humans are but grains of sand on a universal beach according to Cruise.  Their elimination is meaningless.  From the rooftops LA is beautiful but meaningless.  Our lives are absurd in an Existential Philosophy without redemption.  I protest, but that's the post-Hitchcock vision of so many films today. <br />
0385510454|3.0|I remember finding my first John Grisham book in a bargain bin at the mall.Neither I nor anyone else knew who he was then.I read A Time To Kill without stopping and instantly became a fan. There have been some books I have enjoyed better than others. Mr. Grisham's ability to introduce us to interesting characters, watch their development and explore how those characters interact and relate to all around them is a true joy. <br />This book does none of that although the potential is there. Having coffee and learning a foreign language is less than that. Characters come and go through the book without us getting to know them.  <br />So much was blah, blah, blah, oh - I had better make something happen - blah, blah, blah. <br />This could have been a great one...but it really is a significant disappointment.
B000002GC2|5.0|This is one of the best-ever albums arranged and produced by Quincy Jones who is one of the most versatile artists in the jazz scene. He's been dubbed as a 'Renaissance Man' of American music. He's not only a great arranger/conductor but also a songwriter, soloist, bandleader, producer and record label executive.<br /><br />This CD delights us with hits such as \\"One Hundred Ways\\" and \\"Just Once\\" (with James Ingram on vocals) and guest jazz artists and musicians, the likes of vocalists Patti Austin and James Ingram, percussionist Paulinho Da Costa and pianist Herbie Hancock, and the great Toots Thielemans showcasing his unique talent on harmonica, among many others.<br /><br />James Ingram shines brightly as he sings my absolute all-time favorite \\"One Hundred Ways\\" from the heart - such a lovely song that speaks of the secret of romance in terms of roses, violins, moonlight and stars.<br /><br />\\"Compliment what she does<br />Send her roses just because<br />If it's violins she loves<br />Let them play<br />Dedicate her favorite song....\\"<br /><br />You should get this CD and you'll enjoy listening not only to this song but all the tracks as well. This song was written by Kathy Wakefield/Ben Wright/Tony Coleman and arranged by Quincy Jones and Johnny Mandel.<br /><br />If you love mellow and captivating melodies, then this is just perfect - \\"Velas\\" written by Ivan Lins and Victor Martins and arranged by Mr. Q and Johnny Mandel.  One of the finest jazz musicians, Toots Thielemans exquisitely plays the harmonica with his famous 'whistle'. If this melody will not totally move you, I don't know what will.<br /><br />James Ingram's heartfelt performance on \\"Just Once\\" is one of the highlights. David Foster and Robbie Buchanan's acoustic piano accompaniments are simply awesome! The sprightly tracks are \\"Ai No Corrida\\" and \\"Razzamatazz\\" with vocals by a fine jazz diva, Patti Austin.<br /><br />I've had this album since the early '80s when it first came out and the CD in the '90s, and to this day never fail to listen to it. One of Mr. Q's classics.'s classics.
B000089QEN|5.0|The novel \\"Vanity Fair\\" is subtitled by the author \\"A Novel Without a Hero\\".  Becky Sharp is the first anti-heroine in English literature. Thakeray looks down his nose at all of his characters.  After getting into the novel you discover that the author himself is the hero of the novel in that he thinks his intelligence and opinions are far better than anyone elses.  With that understood you can sit back and enjoy his biting observations of the hypocracy of English society of the time:  the arbitrary class divisions, the frantic scrambling to find a suitable (read Wealthy) husband, and the leeming-like rush for everyone in the upper classes to live well beyond there means at the very real risk of bankrupcy. <br /> <br />This is not Austen with a put-upon heroine that you can identify with. This is not Dickens with suffering and noble Poor and where goodness is always rewarded. <br /> <br />This A&E/BBC version is a very close adaptation of the book and does not sugar-coat anything. The cast may be unfamiliar with American audiences, but it includes some of the finest character actors that Britain has to offer.  The story is not \\"easy\\" in that it is not formulaic, but the entire production from screenplay to casting and acting, to period details is a feast. Good does win out in the end, but the wicked are not necessarily punished.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|Team America: World Police, most of these reviews leak some of the best parts of the movie. Mainly because the whole movie was great. Not many \\"DERP\\" laughs out of this,but the ones there are really funny. <br />      I really don't care what other people think or do, but if you care about what some actors think about war and politics don't watch it if you can't stand the crudeness and vulgarness and just plain wrongness of South Park don't watch. If some of those things just mentioned is why you love South Park, or if your open minded Please watch and if you are a Trey Parker And Matt Stone fan please watch \\"Cannilbal: The Musical\\", \\"Orgazmo\\"(both of which directed and starring Trey Parker), and if you love \\"DERP\\" laughs watch \\"BASEketball\\" directed by David Zucker and starring Trey Parker and Matt Stone <br />     Seriously Trey Parker is my hero <br />All three of those movies mentioned there are available here(as for Team America ,not yet i can't wait though)
B000069AUI|5.0|I love Coldplay, I think that they are one of the most original bands out there today.  Imagine a group who writes their own songs and plays their own instruments.  Isn't that just amazing?  Doesn't it make you wish there were more groups like that?  After reading several one star reviews of this, and other Coldplay albums, I was able to find a common denominator in them: the people who wrote them didn't like them because they are British.  It came up in 90% of the reviews.  The Beatles were British, they didn't suck. Ozzy Osbourne's British, he doesn't entirely suck. Another thing I found was people claiming that they were trying to be like Radiohead or U2, and they certainly aren't pop.  I don't recall anywhere Chris Martin or any other member saying that they were trying to be like anyone else.  Coldplay is genuine and unique.  Their songs are great, the lyrics rock, and there is nothing wrong with having a piano in a band.  Bottom line:  Coldplay has more staying power and more talent than most of today's artists combined.
6305922756|5.0|Even if you already own the Criterion edition of this movie, this edition is well worth getting if for nothing else than the commentary by the band in character, which manages the impossible in actually rivaling the movie itself for quotable lines. I ended up laughing more at this than the movie itself, which is saying a lot. Even the menus are done in the same low-key kind of humor that makes the movie so subtly brilliant.
B0000025ZF|4.0|This is probably Waters' best solo album.  Great music with Clapton on guitars but I have a real problem with the mix.  The thing that makes Roger Waters great is his lyrics, which are very difficult to hear through most of the album.  Not sure if he intended this or not, but it is very annoying.  Crank up the volume to hear Roger, then get blasted out by the music.   <br /> <br />His later work is better in terms of being able to hear the lyrics, but the music isn't up to the quality of this album.  Nevertheless, this is probably a must have for Roger Waters fans and likely for Pink Floyd fans in general.
0440178002|1.0|I was first introduced to Shogun via the TV mini-series. It is a gem. Usually the book is even better than the media version. Not so. The book is full of cursing & trash talk. It is tedious in plot and story development. The only saving part of the book is the addendum page (yes, just 1) that \\"completes\\" the Shogun saga.<br /><br />Avoid the book, buy the DVD version of the story - interesting, entertaining, educational and well crafted.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This is the best 'teen angst' film I've seen, and one of the best period. As someone who had the unfortunate experience of enduring 7th grade in Columbia Falls, Montana (pop. 4,000)...I feel this film right down to the fanny pack/moon boot ensemble, the perpetual corn dog cafeteria lunches, the evil 'big hair girls' (as I called them) and the nary foreigner kid who befriends the rest of the outsiders in school.  <br />I admired those outsiders, not for their smarts or 'knowing what it's like', but for their simplicity of just being and not giving a hoot on being popular. To me, this film seems to embrace that notion, while spontaneously filling you up with right-on-target irony and sarcasm and hilarious small-town satire that, you'd might just have had to 'be there too once' to *really* know.  <br />If you liked Welcome To The Dollhouse by Todd Solondz, you'll love this film just the same. The pure genius of these guys who pulled it all together- newcomer writer/director Jared Hess, and first-time actors Jon Heder and Aaron Ruell (who happens to be an amazing, hip photographer in real life)- is not only extraordinary, but inspiring for soon-to-be indie filmmakers as well.  <br />It's great to see a comedy like this that is far away from the usual Jim Carey/Jackass/Ben Stiller DreamWorks stuff that we are so bombarded with today. <br />Brilliant! <br />P.S. Don't forget to keep watching after the final credits roll.
0316666343|5.0|As a writer, there are certain things that irritate me or turn me off. One of them is a writer's use of cutesy names for their characters, like Susie Salmon. The book begins: My name is Salmon, like the fish: first name, Susie. But then there was the next line: I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973. I decided, at this point, to give it a chance. And I am certainly glad that I did. <br /> <br />Alice Sebold did a magnificent job handling her material and creating a protagonist that was at once intelligent, thoughtful and sympathetic. I must admit, however, that when the book was first recommended to me, and I was told that the story was narrated by the murder victim who was now looking down from heaven, I had my doubts. As it turned out, my doubts were unwarranted. Ms. Sebold handled the unique point of view with grace and a delicate, knowing expertise. <br /> <br />I have always believed in the possibilty that things exist which I might not be able to prove personally, things I haven't ever experienced. Simply because I haven't personally experienced them does not mean that they don't or cannot exist. So it's not hard for me to accept the concept of Susie Salmon narrating from her own private heaven. And then there's the concept of every person who has died having their own heaven. True, there are a number of concepts that might be difficult to accept, if they hadn't been pulled off so smoothly by Ms. Sebold. <br /> <br />I have purchased a number of copies of this book to give to friends--fellow writers--who I thought would appreciate the craft displayed within. The Lovely Bones is another one of those stories that I found myself wishing I had written. And it is one of those books that I will, no doubt, reread a number of times. <br /> <br />Final note: Critics vary on their positions regarding this book. Some love it while others despise it. That's a huge part of the reason that I believe we should all make our own decisions about art and literature, and not let critics decide for us what we will or will not read or otherwise experience. Don't listen to what others are saying--I guess that would include my review here--but instead listen to yourself. Pick up the book and start reading it. If you do, I believe you won't want to put it down until you've reached the end.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I loved this movie, and though it doesnt follow Iliad it was entertaining and a pleasure to watch.  I was not a Pitt fan before this movie, but I am now after watching it.  The character development wasnt all that great and I blame the writing for that.  Brad's Achilles will always be Achilles to me, and Eric Bana's Hector was terrific.  The two of them make the movie worth the length. Troy is a keeper. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006HXXBA|5.0|I have been a metal head since 1972. Raised on Black Sabbath, Grand Funk,KISS and many others. I am always looking for the next fix of \\"pure\\" metal. I certainly never expected to get that fix so soon in the year. I am a big fan of KREATOR both live and studio. I sensed they were on to something good with VIOLENT REVOLUTION but I never get my hopes up. ENEMY OF GOD has totally surpassed my wildest expectations. I realize it is only January and that Judas Priest and Overkill are coming up soon but I can safely say that ENEMY OF GOD is going to be in my TOP 5 for 2005 if not #1. It is a brilliant peice of metal.
B0002X314C|5.0|Thank God for John Legend. I was starting to doubt the music industry for just a moment until I heard this man's voice. This album is pure soul. I think John Legend has a long and beautiful career ahead of him.  The album is  beautiful, mellow, and sexy. Ranging from topics such as cheating to being in love. I highly recommend that you get this album.  With this album, John Legend has proved that he is and will be a Legend.
B00005JMYI|4.0|This movie was great in the theatres but it seems it lost something when it came out on DVD.  The cast is great but I don't think I would watch it more then once on DVD.  If you are a true Saturday Night Live fan you might want to buy it just because of the cast but otherwise probably not.  Will Ferrell does an outstanding job trying to save this movie from itself.  He is most likely the only actor that could pull off this story line.
0385510454|3.0|\\"The Broker\\" represents something new for Grisham. It is far from the courtroom scene allthough the main character is a former lawyer. Here we are taken to the world of espionage with characthers from the CIA, MOSSAD, GRU and other well known spy agencies.  <br /> <br />The story in the book is thrilling, but the focus on trying to learn the reader Italian and details about the Italian country-side takes up to much of the book. As the excitment in the story increases the more sections you have about languague and sights. <br /> <br />In my opnion the book has to much culture and to little action.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Two years ago,I bought and listened to every single track on this cd and till this day,I have never put it down. Not one track disappointed me. She went through great lengths to insure that her sophmore album would produce.  <br />Being that she was absent for some years since her debute,she used that time to find the material for the critically aclaimed, \\"Stripped\\". This album shows the collaboration of producers, vocal ability, nothing but pure creativity. Superizing, I had to credit her as also being lyrically talented. Songs that have got me through some tough times, especially tracks like, \\"Walk Away\\",\\"The Voice Within\\" and \\"Impossible\\". Talking from relationships,self discover, to female empowerment; songs that make the artist. <br />I first heard of her from the \\"Mulan\\" soundtrack and was hook ever since. She definatlly reminds of a young Aretha but no comparison when it comes to being an individualists. Some may not like her taste of music or what she might being wearing not to ge off the subject but she finds ways to get our attention and \\"Stripped\\" shows that she had really grown as an artist. <br />What more can I say, Christina Aguilera was given a voice and she uses it well. Im not going to bash Britney and all the other singers who may or may not be vocally talented, but what I will say is the that this vocallist has come along way. <br />I'm so eagar to whats next from the \\"diva within\\"
B000002AZ8|4.0|Pearl Jam's third album \\"Vitalogy\\" is a transitional album that bridges the gap between the raw, confrontational rock of \\"Vs.\\" and the artsy \\"No Code\\". It's not quite as strong as either of those, but an excellent album nonetheless.     A powerful riff in 5/4 time begins \\"Last Exit\\", a raucous opener with a catchy hook. Even more intense is the crazed punk stomp of \\"Spin the Black Circle\\" (a song simply about Vedder's love of vinyl LP's).     \\"Not For You\\" is a sinister, calculated rocker that works the soft/loud dynamics perfectly. Forboding verse, raging chorus. \\"Tremor Christ\\" is a bit more pensive, but just as powerful.     \\"Corduroy\\" is a favorite among Pearl Jam fans for good reason. Its fiery verses are paired with an infectious pop chorus, thus creating a song with unlimited appeal. And that spacey intro rules.    Don't worry, there's more than just rockers. The folksy \\"Nothingman\\" hints in the direction they'd take on \\"No Code\\". And \\"Betterman\\" starts off as a slow ballad before shifting into a pure, blissful pop song.     Songs like \\"Pry, To\\", \\"Bugs\\" (a metaphorical rant set to a creepy accordian), \\"Aye Davinita\\" (some spirutal chant), and \\"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me\\" (a bizarre, Revolution #9 style audio collage) seem like deliberate experiments in order to alienate casual fans. It seemed to have work, as subsequent albums sold less and less.     Other highlights (of actual songs) include the breakneck punk of \\"Whipping\\", the meditative masterpiece that is \\"Immortality\\" (a song no doubt inspired by Kurt Cobain's suicide), and \\"Satan's Bed\\", a rowdy & fun rocker.     Although it's not Pearl Jam's strongest album, it's still excellent stuff. A welcome addition to a rock fan's library. It also has the coolest artwork/booklet ever.    Best Songs: Immortality, Corduroy, Spin the Black Circle, Tremor Christ, Satan's Bed, Betterman.
015626224X|4.0|Orwell rapidly became one of my favorite writers after I finished Animal Farm and 1984. I thought these books were great and so I set out to find more of his books. This is the book I stumbled upon and found is just as fascinating as the other two. This book outlines the plight of poverty in urban settings; from the long ours as a plongeure in Paris, to the rowdiness of late night pubs in London. Through out the novel he describes the terrible inconvenience and burdon having no money places upon a poor person. He also tells of great adventures he shares with his friends in trying to acquire money and fun. I highly recommend this book to any reader but especially to Orwell fans.  <br /> <br />
B000005DQR|5.0|I got this album after seeing the video for Midnight In a Perfect World.  This was like 98 or 99, so i was more into Wu-Tang and more popular hip hop and then also listening to Daft Punk and Future Sound Of London type stuff.  When i got home and listened to the disc, i was like \\"what the f*** is this?\\" put it on the shelf.  One night i couldn't sleep and i remembered how this CD sounded so i put it on to get to sleep.  4 songs in i was out.  Next night, started with track 5....by 9 i was out.  Kept doing that until i heard the whole thing several times.  Realized i loved the CD.  I still remember waking up terrified when the CD wraps up with Transmission 3 and that voice saying eerily, mind you i'm half conscious, \\"It is happenning again. It is happenning again.\\"  That blew me away that this cat made this crazy album so perfectly. <br /> <br />I concur with another reviewer: out of all the albums i own, this is my favorite.  I listen to this at least 3 times a week.  <br /> <br />This kind of music makes life feel like a movie.  When i'm driving in the snow, gotta put on some Shadow.  Driving on back country roads, Shadow.  I got all Shadow's work on a playlist on my XBox for when i'm playing Grand Theft Auto....surreal, i can't tell you how much better the game is. <br /> <br />Fans of music, I mean good music, well produced music, should own this album.  I also recommend Shadow's first album \\"Pre-emptive Strike\\", his third \\"Private Press\\", and if you are a fan of Shadow specificly...get his DVD: In Tune and On Time.  The DVD comes with a CD of an edited version of the performance by Shadow in the UK and you actually get to see him do what he does.  <br /> <br />Shadow's U.N.K.L.E. album was slightly disappointing, but there are a few tracks at least worth downloading. <br />
B000002UB6|5.0|this is an amazing album, not \\"flawed\\" or \\"whatever\\" everyone likes to call it.  I don't know why it's so popular to bash this album.  monkey see monkey do? <br /> <br />the first three tracks are especially strong. <br /> <br />john lennon's voice is the best I've ever heard it on \\"across the universe\\" <br /> <br />\\"two of us\\" is just, well, perfect. <br /> <br />\\"dig a pony\\" has an amazing riff, rawk. <br /> <br />you should also check out the song from this era \\"don't let me down\\" ...incredible, similar mood <br /> <br />also, the extra instruments sound great to me.  I listened to the \\"naked\\" versions of the songs in question, and they were LAME in comparison.  on across the universe they added these cheesy choir singers that just sound awful...to the naked version! how ironic??? <br /> <br />i'd recommend watching the film too, particularly the rooftop performance, it's positively cheerful, lots of fun. <br /> <br />the mood of this album, or at least how i feel listening to it, is jubilant.  it's loose and fun. <br /> <br />a great group of songs.  maybe some of them are sort of \\"throwaways\\", but hey this is the beatles, and even those are fun and great. <br /> <br />one of my favorite beatles albums (others: abbey road, rubber soul)
B000002UVZ|5.0|Okay, so the header isn't true. But R.E.M. did crank up the volume a little bit on \\"Life's Rich Pageant\\". There's still a lot of jangle, but now they've added some distortion to the mix. Thus, \\"Pageant\\" rocks a lot harder than the band's first three efforts.  <br /> <br />But the main reason this album is such a winner is that it contains some of R.E.M.'s best songs. \\"Begin the Begin\\" and \\"These Days\\" is a killer one-two punch to open the album. Cool riffs, infectious melodies, killer hooks, and even some power chords! <br /> <br />And that's not the end of it. \\"Hyena\\" and \\"Just a Touch\\" are loose, rowdy, fun rockers. And catchy! Extremely catchy! The band is becoming masterful at crafting hooks at this point. It really shows. <br /> <br />Don't worry, there's plenty of softer moments too. \\"Fall on Me\\" is a haunting, beautiful song with a blissful pop chorus. \\"Cuyahoga\\" is similar in that regard. And \\"What If We Give It Away?\\" is a terrific mid-tempo number that contains one of Michael's prettiest hooks. The vocal harmonies and overdubs on these songs are wonderful. <br /> <br />\\"The Flowers of Guatemala\\" is one of R.E.M.'s best songs. It's a power ballad of sorts; the soft & dreamy beginning gradually builds up in volume until launching into a Peter Buck guitar solo. Not one of those \\"Hey, look at me!\\" guitar solos either. A brief, but memorable one. It'll probably give you goosebumps.  <br /> <br />Other highlights (on an album full of highlights) include the jangly \\"I Believe\\" (a clear link to their previous albums), the chilling folk dirge that is \\"Swan Swan H\\", and the lighthearted coda \\"Superman\\" (a fun cover tune sung by Mike Mills).  <br /> <br />You'll also notice that \\"Pageant\\" is a bit more politically charged than past R.E.M. albums. This would be an even bigger factor on their breakthrough follow-up, \\"Document\\", which is their most overtly political album by far.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this album is often overlooked by most people (except diehardfans). It's a shame, because \\"Life's Rich Pageant\\" is one of R.E.M.'s crowning achievements. In my opinion, the best album of their IRS years. Don't pass it up based on obscurity. <br /> <br />Best Songs: Flowers of Guatemala, What If We Give It Away?, Begin the Begin, Fall on Me, Swan Swan H. <br />
B00005RHGK|3.0|I agree with the majority of reviewers that this is one of the better horror movies to have been made, including, sadly, Jeepers Creepers 2.  I'm writing to mention that the director's commentary for this movie is a hidden treat on the dvd - it's just great, especially since as you watch Jeepers Creepers you can't help wondering why more horror movies are not this good.  Victor Sava goes through all his thought processes, telling us how he made this movie work.  He describes how he developed the characters, how he conceived the story, how he used lighting and mood in the film and many other fascinating details that make you feel like you're really on the inside of the process.  One of the most interesting parts of his commentary is his description of how he had to fight the studio/producer to keep certain scenes in the movie:  the essential tension being that he wanted to develop the characters so that we would care when something happened to them, and the producer wanted to get to the slashing.  I've watched  lot of these commentaries and they readily devolve into a bunch of anecdotes that, in the end, are not very interesting.  (This is exactly what happened in the commentary to Jeepers Creepers 2, which is a stinkfest of Sava and bunch of young actors telling in-jokes about the production.)  This one really is good, though, it's almost like a mini-film school, or at least one of the better lectures at a mini-film school.  Similarly recommended are the special features included in the special edition DVD of Robert Rodriguez's Desperado/El Mariachi.
B000002H33|5.0|This is by far the greatest cd metallica has ever done...it shows you how mature became the band afer \\"kill\\" and \\"lightning\\" also Cliff brought a different influence, they played more harmony and classtical stuff (refering to puppetz first solo and the heart-pounding intro of battery)I'm Sorry Megadeth fans but this shows that Hetfield is a much greater musician than Dave ,and me, as a personal fan of Megadeth, admit that THEY can't top this album...this album proves that Metallica was the master of heavy/trash metal at that time, not a bunch of 4 mtv drones that sold up...

6305076626|5.0|Okay, I'm writing about a movie that has become a part of my life in more ways than one for the better part of the past 16 years! <br /> <br />As a performer in two of the role-playing casts in the Boston area (check [...] I've had my share of experiences through Rocky Horror.  Most of them good, and needless to say I got exposed to a lot more about life and other things than I'd ever imagined! <br /> <br />What makes people go back again and again?  A lot of things, but the fact that this film and the theaters that run it are the one place for many that they can go and be accepted for who they are, and without reservations.  Usually. <br /> <br />The film itself is the offshoot of the successful London production, and while it did not translate to the screen immediately, it found its way.   <br /> <br />It's really just not the same watching it at home (if that's all you've ever done, you're still a virgin!).  The send up of a long line of bad horror, sci-fi and other flicks that Richard O'Brien was raised on in the 50's were the catalyst, and they've led to a phenomena that cannot be accurately explained. <br /> <br />All I can say is, no matter how bad a film it may seem, it is a classic and a great work to us.   <br /> <br />Don't Dream It, Be It!
B00005N5S5|1.0|BEWARE!! This DVD is not as advertised!  It isn't a double-sided \\"special edition\\".  Lies!  The features listed above are not here.  I have a DVD-ROM player and could find no such hidden menu features.  I've bought this DVD EXPECTING these features.  er....????  A waste.  MGM is a complete screw-up company.  Their package designed is half-arsed.  This looks completely hacked together by Photoshop.  You can clearly see where the original picture was cropped, and they cropped the laser sight.  ????  Also take a look at their ridiculous \\"modern\\" redisign of To Live and Die in LA.  I hope somebody there is reading this.  You've made the LIST.  A complete waste of a classic.
0385510454|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It was something 'different' from Grisham. It was exciting and adventurous. I'm a big fan of Grisham and lived in Italy for two years, this may have had an impact on my opinion.  <br /> <br />I could hardly put this book down. Just like my new morning brew made from soy beans. Taste like coffee, sans the caffeine, and contains no tannic acids. I have no more heartburn and that is something to write about. Google it online under \\"s oyfee\\". <br /> <br />Still, an excellent novel.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Previous reviwer, S. Muco said: I do not know but after listening to Franz Ferdinand I noticed that they are a complete rip off of Interpol, and a bad one since after 10-15 listening you will hate them, do yourslef a favor go get interpol that is where they got their inspiration example. Interpol \\"Slow Hands. <br /> <br />I say: I like interpol alot, but franz ferdinand hardly copies their sound you are a dumbass, this album was released in march, slow hands was released on the 9th of september you fool.
B000002J2B|5.0|I am a bigtime Genesis fan, but I am not exclusively worshipful of one certain period like a lot of Genesis \\"fans\\".  Almost every album is different than the other, and though there were large changes over time, they all have different types of greatness to offer.  I do agree that W+W is an end to one period of style.  Really, Trick of the Tail and W+W are very similar albums- having been done in '76 and '77, and I have heard from experts that they originally were almost combined and may be released that way in the future. <br />    I consider them the greatest 2 Genesis albums.  They are the most cohesive, at least in style.  I also feel Duke is a very stylistically and sonically cohesive album.  Obviously \\"The Lamb\\" is also, being a concept album.  There are probably more strong songs on TOTT, but I can't fathom how anyone could say \\"One For the Vine\\" is a \\"flawed\\" composition.  It is probably one of the most amazing compositions I have ever heard- and is truly in the realm of great classical compositions, with different developed themes and a circular structure that finds an amazing path back to it's opening theme.  Between these 2 albums there are more amazing, sophisticated, original, and beautiful chord progressions, sounds, and rythyms made by the band than on a pile of most other \\"rock\\" albums. <br />    If you don't like keyboards (mellotrons for instance), then by all means stay away from these albums.  They are a keyboard lover's dream.  If you have a problem with Tony's keyboards, then Genesis might as well not exist.  Also, though there are some amazing, poetic, and creative lyrics to be found everywhere in a lot of Genesis albums, lyrics have NEVER been more than equally important to the music in a Genesis song.  If you love MUSIC, and being transported into special worlds, you will love these albums.
B000002I25|5.0|I was twelve years old. I was taking a shower on a saturday night. All of a sudden they start playing \\"Break On Through\\". I had no idea who the Doors were. When I heard the song I thought \\"that must  be THE TROGGS\\" (another hip group back in the day).<br /><br />The song blew me away as a young kid and to this day, I have never grown tired of it. This is definately one of the best rock 'n roll albums of all time.<br /><br />This is all just my opinion of course, but for me - The Doors were all downhill after this album. After this album it sounds to me like somebody (their record label?) was trying to commercialize their sound. This album has this raw energy that none of their other albums have.<br /><br />Actually \\"Road House Blues\\" from I forget which Album - that one captures that raw Doors energy. They must have been awesome live.
B000002KDO|5.0|First of all, metal fans must buy 'Black Box', unless you already have all their original albums.  That's all you really need to know, but I'll review this album in particular anyway.<br /><br />Black Sabbath's debut wasn't an all out metal album, though it definitely had lots of metal in it, and 'Paranoid' had even more, though it could  be argued that it wasn't an all out metal album either.(I wouldn't agree, however)  'Master of Reality' is metal,  however. Absolutely no doubt about it.  And it's probably the best Sab album from their classic era.  It's only got 6 full songs, but 2 of them are good, and the other 4 are total classics.  The songwriting isn't always terribly sophisticated, but they write simpler songs and riffs better than anyone else, and they have a flowing, intriguing interplay which is very rare in metal bands.<br /><br />'Sweet Leaf' is the opener, and you've already heard this song, so what I've got say doesn't matter much.  It is a classic, however, incredibly heavy for the time, with that simple, but very, very effective main riff.  Probably only the forth best track here, but definitely very good anyway.  'After Forever' isn't one of the better songs here, but it's still pretty good.  Not as dark and heavy as the other stuff, and the vox aren't particularly inspired, but it's still pretty effective, and it's nice to have a slightly bouncier, more energetic track on the album.  'Children of the Grave' is a masterpiece, which brilliantly uses Ozzy's limited vocal range, and has a main riff which is years ahead of it's time, and is perfectly matched with that percussion and bass heavy section.  'Lord of this World' is underrated, and is another classic.  It's perhaps the most lumbering track here, with the most powerful, bruising groove on the album.  The middle section is fantastic too, with some sweet basswork underneath the leads, and the 'Lord of this World/ Evil Possesser' part is very cool too.  'Orchid' is underrated and unrightly maligned, I think.  Lots of people say it doesn't fit in, but I think it works pretty well, as it is so slow and moody.  It's a simple, pleasant track, with some nice flute.  Not nearly the best thing here, for sure, but still a worthwhile track.  'Into the Void' is perhaps the best track on the album, with some more years ahead of it's time riffing, and a long, multi-riff intro which is also quite innovative.  Ozzy's droning, monotonous vocals are very effective too, and vaguely hypnotic.  (Ozzy's a terrible singer, but they found a way to make him work time and again on there albums.)<br /><br />Yeah, that's it.  Historically monumental, and a brilliant album, to boot.maligned, I think.  Lots of people say it doesn't fit in, but I think it works pretty well, as it is so slow and moody.

B0001BKAEY|1.0|This movie was one of the biggest let downs ever. They left so many questions unanswered, and raised even more that were left unanswered. While the other 2 matrix movies had a deep philosophical meanings, and even very good twists in them, the 3rd was just a huge battle with no thought required. It was pure cheese on the highest level. <br /> <br />1) why is it Neo saw in orange matrix code? <br />2) What happened to the twins? <br />3) Never explained where neo was during his black out, and Mobil Ave, an anogram for Limbo was corny at best. <br />4) Changed charaters motives and personality to suite the 3rd movie. Marovengian (spelling) was very arogant and took no crap, this time he takes it and loves it. <br />5) Why couldn't the machines just shut down the matrix, since they said they could survive without humans anyway. That would have killed Smith and all programs inside it. <br />6) why was everyone so dumb? If only one person survived a huge battle unscarred, perhaps it would be wise to put him under armed gurad.  <br />7) I like how Smith used electrical wire to burn neos face, but neither of them got electricuted!!!! <br />8) why would the people arm every ship with an EMP, but not one for their home base? <br />9) the final battle scene? you have to see it to believe the level of cheese used. I laughed more than anything. Between the little kid saving the day, and Nona Gaye's character and her hinted at lesbiian side kick, i did not know what to do with myself. <br />10) dont you think its ironic, that if Neo would have let Smith take over his body in the second movie, would could have all been spared this crap? <br /> <br />Overall a very bad movie. It actually broke my heart because i loved the series so much. Kids never make a movie when you are going through a bitter divorce and you are thinking about having gender relocation surgery, or else you will put out a movie just like this garbage. Hard to focus when you have all that going on
B00005JNEW|5.0|This is a great movie for football fans and non-fans alike. The casting is great . I loved the book and movies are not usually as good as the book but this one is. It captures the essence of high school football as to how it is revered and worshipped in some places, this place being West Texas. The casting is magnificent. Billy Bob Thornton, as the coach, and Tim McGraw, as the father of the one of the star players and a former star player himself, are top notch. It keeps you riveted to the screen for the entire 2 hours.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Being an Australian (we didn't get to see Live Aid!) this DVD package gives us, albeit 20 years later, the chance to be a part of perhaps the greatest music event and line-up of acts in history. In the past I've read of the famous performances of Queen and U2 at Live Aid, and now this DVD enables me to see what I missed. After seeing them perform, I wish I was there. <br /> <br />Even though the sound is inferior to current production quality and there is some horizontal 'banding' (the DVD booklet that comes with the four discs explains why this is so), this product is still very watchable.  <br /> <br />While each act contributes a few songs to the DVD (their whole set list is not included for obvious reasons), there are no songs which are incomplete. <br /> <br />With over 10 hours of footage this DVD is definately worth every cent. It is an incredible experience to witness this monumental piece of history.
0375822429|3.0|I love Roald Dahl, but this just isn't one of his best.  Mr. & Mrs. Twit, the main character's are not very nice, and when they perform cruel practical jokes on each other you really don't have much sympathy for either one since you aren't meant to really like them.  Some of the jokes are classics however, such as making the wife's cane a little longer each night, and her chair a little taller each day so that she thinks she is shrinking.  I've seen several television shows do take offs on this joke over the years to try to get someone to believe they were shrinking, or doing it in reverse so that they believe they are getting taller.  The Twit's also own a family of monkeys they obtained while working in the circus, and the father monkey's name is Muggle-Wump.  ((This book was written in 1980 and I'm curious if J.K. Rowlings (the writer of \\"Harry Potter\\") got her name for humans \\"muggles\\" from reading this book.))  Muggle-Wump is a smart monkey, and with the help of his family and of some birds, lead by an African Bird named the Roly-Poly Bird, they get revenge on the Twits for the cruel treatment they have been given, and turn the Twit's world upside down.
0385491026|3.0|Cat's Eye is a solid piece of storytelling.  It's not as compelling as 'Alias Grace' or 'The Robber Bride' - but it's certainly a book that will stay with you. <br /> <br />The premise of Cat's Eye has the protagonist, Elaine, reminiscing about her transition from girl to woman in Canada.  Woven into the story is her like/hate relationship with a fellow classmate, Cordelia. <br /> <br />I use like/hate because 'love' is not an emotion shared between these two characters - and I think that's what makes the book compelling.  It's not often that a novel captures the dynamics between people who don't like each other very much, but are tied together for inexplicable reasons. <br /> <br />And that's what Cat's Eye accomplishes.  It shows the difficulty of knowing someone that you would make an attempt *not* to know if you were in different circumstances.  And it details how sometimes such relationships can have a long-lasting impact on one's outlook and sense of self. <br /> <br />Atwood also does an excellent job of providing glimpses into the moments when the child becomes the parent - and has no choice but to accept the sometimes poor choices one's parents made when growing up. <br /> <br />There is also a perfectly brief side story about the passing of a close relative of Elaine that is lyrically tragic. <br /> <br />If you haven't read Atwood before, it's a good jumping on point. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What more can be said that other reviews haven't? This was a FANTASTIC series and the fact that it's not on any longer speaks to something inherently wrong with modern television(probably television from its inception).  My partner, who likes sci-fi, but doesn't begin to even want to watch one episode of Buffy, loved this series. It's just about the best thing ever put on TV - EVER!   <br /> <br />This is 3rd and 5th season of Buffy good. This is 1-2nd season of West Wing good. If you don't watch this and appreciate it, you belong in a hell watching Paris Hilton reality shows for eternity.
B00004Z459|5.0|The year was 2000.  The advent of the millenium upon us spawned that altogether wonderful and awful genre oddly titled nu-metal.   <br /> <br />I distinctly remember as a junior in high school feeling in direct opposition to the angsty, depressed, and anger-driven thrash that threatened to obliterate the line between rap and metal.  To me, bands like Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach were going to be short-lived fads, gimmicks just like many genres that disappeared in the wind.  It was my contention that the only good bands to come out of this hatefest were Incubus and the Deftones.   <br /> <br />In 2000, I think i was still stuck back in the early-to-mid 90's.  Grunge was the height of my listening palate: all I yearned for was that meat-and-potatoes distortion and actual SINGING instead of rapping.  Five years later, I'm a senior in college.  My tastes expanded drastically as i picked up a love for alt and art-metal like Tool, progressive rock acts like Dream Theater, and eclectic early Nu Metal like Faith No More.  How could I have guessed that I would come full circle, back to the realm of that which I rejected 5 years ago.    <br /> <br />Linkin Park's \\"Hybrid Theory\\" is an enigma to me.  I suppose the stellar production of said album lent this palatability.   The songs profess a progressive quality alien to much of average nu-metal...lent partially by the rap-rock mesh that works so much better for this band, but mostly by the textures, structures, and ear-candy repetitions.   <br /> <br />Joseph Hahn's samplings and creations bring to mind D.J. Kilmore of Incubus, yet the fact that such innately musical moments are brought so much more evoke Utra-era Depeche Mode as well as Trent Reznor in his early years.  The album title \\"Hybrid Theory\\" was to be the original band name for Linkin Park, and probably should have stayed that way.  It is so much more faithful to the identity of the band: for the \\"nu-metal\\" outfit is exactly a hybrid: breeding musical quality with earth shattering guitar, courtesy of Brad Delson, vocals that are both scathing and melodic by Chester Bennington, and poetic rapping by emcee Mike Shinoda.   <br /> <br />Pop-friendly hits like \\"Papercut\\" and \\"With You\\" comprise of simple verse-chorus-verse structures, and brand the vocal \\"motifs\\" of the songs into the listener's heads.  Alternately, the popular \\"Crawling\\" shows an impressive amount of range in its sound textures, \\"In The End\\" showcases Shinoda's constant sense of presence and Bennington's steady vocal qualities.  \\"A Cure for the Itch\\" puts the spotlight on aptly talented Hahn and creates a much-welcomed break from the rap-rock thrash.    <br /> <br />\\"Hybrid Theory\\" is a superbly crafted album, and has surpassed the short-lived nu-metal label to become something more  appropriately titled: Progressive Metal.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This isn't technically a review of the album. I think its great and all, nothing life changing or anything. I'm just annoyed by the people who gave it a one star rating because people actually like it. So what people have found a cd to cling onto like the bible? Is that your business? Hell no. Then they mock people for thinking they are cool for listening to Radiohead. Morons. These are probably the same type of people that ridicule any type of mainstream successful music because its just that. They think they are so \\"cool\\" for not buying into that. Good for you. I bet the same bands you hate are laughing at your sorry ass all the way to the bank. Stop criticizing people for liking music that they enjoy. Is that how you people get your jollies? Going around making fun of everyone else for being \\"mainstream?\\" Ugh. Get a life you pathetic pond scum. And you know there is a reason why your favorite bands havent been picked up to a record label. THEY SUCK! Well. Not really. I just had to say that. Lol. So let me step off my soapbox now and walk away before I say something I dont mean. ^-^
B00000AFGM|5.0|It's a damn good thing there are such perfections as Marilyn Manson--I don't know what we'd do without thier genius. Since thier release of 'Portrait,' Marilyn Manson has explored virtually every sound and style of hard-rock on earth. I have every CD, and although it runs fairly close with 'Antichrist Supertar,' the 'Mechanical Animals' album is the Greatest (notice that I capitalized? It's not a typo, guys...). <br /> <br />From the stamping \\"Dope Show,\\" to the though-provoking voices of \\"Coma White,\\" (a personal favorite) the CD is chock full of insight, emotion, and of course beats that stick in your head like a parasite. \\"Rock is Dead,\\" possibly the most popular of the album, was even used in the \\"Matrix\\" soundtrack.  <br /> <br />'Mechanical Animals,' like 'Holywood,' is a hard look at the presures and agony of being a celebrity, drugs, and apathy, and Manson belts it out the way it should be heard; without censor, an unbridled depiction of what life as we know it, truly is. <br /> <br />For those who actually have the decency to look, if you place a trancparency of royal blue over the faded-yellow words under faded blue words on the CD slip-cover, many of the subliminal messages in M.M.'s music are spelled out underneath. Don't try to read these hidden messages with the naked eye. It's virtually impossible, especially the 'My Omega,' on the second page. Photos on the slip-cover are of Manson's glam rock spree, and some of the last of our beloved Twiggy Raimerez, who now resides in \\"A Perfect Circle\\" (another mind-blowing band).   <br /> <br />M.M. fans will adore \\"Mechanical Animals'\\" depth, hard-roch fans looking for a good vibe will find it quite User Friendly, as well. Plug it up, Posthumans, this is the New Model. LOVE IT ALL. <br /> <br />Heard it, had to have it, now we own it, <br />--Miss GIGI
0316779237|3.0|Like many other people, my introduction to David Sedaris was through \\"The Santaland Diaries,\\" broadcast on NPR's \\"This American Life\\" (I think). Maybe it was Sedaris's down-on-his luck history, his brooding delivery, or Ira Glass's fabulous production, but the readings (and their musical segu&eacute;s) were masterpieces. They captured all the ironies of the Christmas holiday -- the humiliation of grown people wearing elf costumes to bring in a few bucks; the madness of parents force-feeding reluctant children into the gaping maw of Macy's Christmas machine; the delicious naughtiness of elves cavorting behind the snowy scenery; the stinginess of the retail business to its own employees.<br /><br />Now that Sedaris has become successful, his readings have lost their desperate edginess. And without Glass's sure and sensitive production, they lose their aural appeal. I'd recommend reading these stories rather than listening to audio versions.<br /><br />That said, \\"Holiday on Ice\\" has a few delights that make it worth a listen. \\"Santaland Diaries,\\" still has a few moments that will have you shaking your head at the lunacy of the Christmas experience. The encounters between the physically and mentally disabled with all-too-human Santas is an exercise in pathos, if not hilarity. \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore\\" is a classic Sedaris piece, whose innocuous beginning lurches without warning into a collision between David's wacked-out family and the bizarre Southern characters that populated Sedaris's youth. For an added treat, \\"Dinah\\" is voiced by Amy Sedaris, the author's talented sister.<br /><br />Other pieces don't succeed as well as these. \\"Based Upon A True Story\\" has a creepy, big-city TV exec blackmailing a \\"hillbilly\\" Christmas church audience, but seems more mean than mirthful. \\"Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol\\" -- in which a theater critic savages children's Christmas pageants -- misses the comic mark entirely. Others, like, \\"Season's Greeting To Our Friends and Family!\\" -- a loonily bitter Christmas letter from a suburban Mom hurled over the edge of sanity and civility by her husband's long-lost Vietnamese daughter -- fail to play the knife-edge that separates a piece that finds humor in discomfort from one that is plain discomfitting.<br /><br />Since the publication of \\"Holidays on Ice,\\" David Sedaris has proven himself as a writer of subtlety, humanity and wry humor. This uneven collection shows him on the way to discovering his voice.Christmas letter from a suburban Mom hurled over the edge of sanity and civility by her husband's long-lost Vietnamese daughter -- fail to play the knife-edge that separates a piece that finds humor in discomfort from one that is plain discomfitting.

He told the audience that there were more books written about Muhammed Ali than Jesus.  Hey Will, First let me tell you that Jesus only put out one book, \\"The Bible\\" and second EVERY knee will bow (Romans 14:11) and call Jesus Lord, not Muhammed Ali.  One more thing, if Ali is so great then why did your movie BOMB at the Box Office while \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" broke records?

B00000HZHS|5.0|Kurt Cobain's excellent lyrical skills were paramount with In Utero.  Die-hard Nirvana fans hail this album as pure rock and roll the way Cobain wanted it.  Embarrassed by the cleaned, polished sound of their 1991 LP, Nevermind, Kurt sought out to go the other direction and put together a sound collage that was as asthetically pleasing for him to make as it would be for any listener to enjoy.  While there is the explicit version out, this version is exclusive in having a particular version of a song.  This is a Scott Litt mixed version of \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" which was to be released as a single at the time of Kurt's untimely death.  The only other release of this version is on the greatest hits album from 2002.  The radio staples of this album are \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\", \\"All Apologies\\",\\"Rape Me(titled \\"Waif Me\\")\\" and \\"Dumb.\\" These four particular songs are great testiment to how Nirvana can create great pop song while maintaining a degree of integrity that is not compromised in rock and roll.  Other tracks have been heralded as unsung gems by Nirvana die-hards.  \\"Very Ape\\" is a lively new wave/punk song.  \\"Milk It\\" is a beautiful sound collage utilizing Nirvana's power of dynamics.  \\"Serve the Servants\\" is a superbly pure rock and roll song that opens the album in great fashion.  From start to finish, In Utero, regarded as Nirvana's finest hour by Nirvana's biggest fans.
078681859X|2.0|While I realize there is a large market for these types of adventure stories employing fantasy elements, I have to say that I would not recommend this book for impressionable minds when there are alternatives that carry more of a useful message.  Specifically, I was disturbed by the fact that NONE of the major characters in the tale possesssed any of the qualities that I believe are virtues to emphasize for younger readers:  loyalty, empathy, justice, fairness, assisting others, self-respect. <br /> <br />The protagonist certainly endures more than his share of hardship, but it leaves him embittered, withdrawn, disappointed, and prone to the types of possessiveness and pride that fuel a vengeful outlook.  By the end of the book he never really emerges from this perspective.  He is challenged, frustrated, and abetted by a cast of characters were are even more vile and self-serving, who value nothing of life but are instead motivated by greed.  The bone thrown by the book to human warmth is the fragile gratitude the youngster feels toward the bit player who feeds him.  Otherwise, all is self-interest and resentment.  I believe it to be a bit of nastiness to set up the tale so that the reader is asked to root for someone whose identity is so tied up in acquisitiveness and power-gambits, and who never steps out of the shadow having learned anything of greater depth.
B00013RC9I|5.0|I have read alot of disappointed reviews about this album. I guess most people wanted them to repeat Moon Safari or 10,000hz Legend, their previews efforts, both fine albums and different from eachother. Moon Safari was brilliant with its atmospheric tones. 10,000hz Legend was a bit darker and more lyrical.  <br /> <br />That said,  this album is my favorite from the band. Cherry Blossom Girl (my favorite on the album) exudes style and immediately grabs you with its lush sound. Run sounds very haunting. Universal Traveler sounds like strange Alien pop. Surfing on a Rocket is very catchy. Biological is also very good with its acoustic guitars and strange bell-like sounds. Come to think of it, I can't really think of a track i didn't like.  <br /> <br />This album has more singing than their previews efforts which i guess some people couldn't get too into. I think it all fits together beautifully. Its a stylish mellow album filled with pretty sounds, strange rhythms and interesting beats. Some elegant pop for those with refined taste.
B0002MPU1K|3.0|The album opens up very strongly with the upbeat St. Louis Blues, one of the highlights of the album.  St. Louis Blues is a cheerful, jazz jam play with wonderful arrangements, piano and vocals.   <br /> <br />After St. Louis Blues the results are mixed as Cincotti ventures into different styles and goes from Jazz to Swing to pop ballads.  Even if you are flexible enough the mix can catch you off guard.   <br /> <br />The album has great moments and those are enough to have you excited about's Peter's bright future.  He still needs to find a more solid style both musically as well as vocally; but the raw talent is definitively there. <br /> <br />If you would like to try a few tracks, I recommend \\"St. Louis Blues\\", \\"I Love Paris\\" and \\"Raise the Roof\\", if you are in an upbeat mood; and \\"He's Watching\\" and \\"On the roof\\" if you are in the mood for nice, slow ballads.
B000002572|3.0|I don't have anything to say that hasn't already been said--and really, how much is there to say about this record?  I'm just voting, is all.  I am fully sympatico to anyone who hates this album; if it disappeared from the face of the Earth tomorrow nobody would be any poorer for it (well, except the people making money from it).  I came here to help me decide if I want to spend two dollars to buy a used copy on eBay.  It's a tough decision.  I've never owned this, but I was in high school in the late 70s and there is something irresistable about it, even if it is ultimately the musical equivalent of junk food.  I still like hearing it and hey, we all need some \\"comfort food\\" now and again.    But just look at the bands listed in the \\"People who bought this album also bought\\" section, and...ugh!  Up against the wall, every one of them!  There must be something that makes this album exceptional--tolerable and even inviting to people like me who are in danger of injuring themselves or damaging their car radios hurriedly turning off songs from bands like Foreigner, Styx, Journey, etc.  Yeah, I guess I'll spring the two bucks for it.    Postscript:  I'm glad I did.  Feels good to hear this on vinyl after so long.  Analog...ahhhhhhhhh!
B000002INJ|5.0|Some like to say manowar is cheesy because almost every song either has: king, blood, steel, metal, or warrior in it. But they have amazing lyrics, they DEFINATELY have the talent esp in the guitar area, so let them sing about metal cause that is what they are good at and damn good at! Hail and Kill will get you to beat the sh*t out of you dash board with you fist everytime you hear it.
0385510454|1.0|I thought I swore off Grisham after \\"The Summons\\", but I gave him a couple more chances with his next books, which were better, but not classic--this one was a total yawner-could have taken Italian language lessons in school, and what's with the travelogue???-Get to the nitty-gritty, John-this was a cure for imsomnia
B000005RFQ|5.0|I've read or heard somewhere thar Born Again was Kurt Cobain's all times favorite album so, although I don't care too much about Nirvana, I can perfectly understand his choice. <br />Ian Gillan and 3/4 of the original Black Sabbath line-up are pure dynamite and they were in the business in earnest. By the way, Gillan's performance is so phenomenal - aggressive, unbelievable high notes, soulful performance as he NEVER did before (yes, not even with Deep Purple) - that right away in his next album, Perfect Strangers, we can percieve the damages this trip caused to his throat. He never was the same after Born Again.  <br />I think is unnecessary to describe or talk about each and every song on the album, because this record is a CLASSIC from the first to the last note.  <br />My only reccomendation is: dim the lights, open a bottle of whisky (or tequila, as in Trashed), turn you stereo on the maximum volume, as the guys did at the Manor (volume 4 is not enough) and enjoy an always pleasant experience!
B00005T30L|5.0|This is definitely an entertaining movie, but although it leaves an impression of being a deeply personal and poignant story, it actually succeeds in reflecting a few broader truths and points of social concern.<br /><br />The pivot of the story is Enid and her boredom and alienation. Although it's easy to see her condition as 'existential' and somehow profound on the personal or spiritual level, it all boils down to her inability to find a role, either through love and (by implication) marriage and having children, or through work and career. This failure is not so much her fault as society's.<br /><br />The only jobs on offer are low paid service jobs (pop-corn seller at the multiplex) that she is too intelligent for, while the only career that might fulfill her mentally -- the artistic one that briefly opens up to her -- is closed off by a 'politically correct' backlash against her artistic honesty.<br /><br />The message here is:(1) be stupid and work in a dull service job, or (2) be clever and get a higher status job but at the cost of being a bland, disimulating, two-faced chimer without much integrity.<br /><br />This leaves only the personal realm through which to find a role, in Enid's case, men. The two relationships open to her are Josh a young guy working in a convenience store and Seymour an assistant manager at the offices of some restaurant chain.<br /><br />The twists and turns of the plot just go to show how unsuitable both of them turn out to be. Josh is just a dumbed down, unskilled, and downtrodden shop boy clearly lacking the intellectual depth that Enid requires. Seymour, on the other hand, has the intellectual depth, but as an office drone, ultimately lacks the courage and physical manliness to fill the role required.<br /><br />Rather than being groomed by society to fill balanced, healthy, natural roles, the people in this movie are either mentally emasculated (Josh), or physically emasculated (Seymour) or have their intelligence or integrity insulted (Enid) by the roles society offers them, all in the name of serving banal service industries or political correctness.<br /><br />Read in the right way, this is a film with a revolutionary, possibly right wing message about the necessity of men being men and women being women, and not existing as fodder for the service economy and as brainwashed sheep of political correctness.them, all in the name of serving banal service industries or political correctness.

The last truly worth U2 song they made was Please ( both album and single versions ). Also that song was voted as the most significant song form Pop on the old [...] ... where's this song ? I don't know. <br /> <br />Do we need those spoiled \\"new mixes\\" ? No. U2 are going downhill but they don't even notice. The unmemorable U2 end has come, but they seem to be resting comfortably numb with sunglasses, cowboy hats, black clothes and all that crap. <br /> <br />time to call a day, really. You are a shame U2.
0765309408|4.0|Military sci-fi seems very chic as of late. Several months ago, \\"Orphanage\\" was released to significant fanfare and while its a good read, it can't hold a candle to its philosophical forebears - \\"Starship Troopers\\" and \\"The Forever War\\". \\"Orphanage\\" simply doesn't bring enough originality to the genre.<br /><br />\\"Old Man's War\\", however, does bring some much-needed originality to the table. There are some obvious influences from Heinlein and Haldeman here, which mostly manifests itself in how Scalzi talks about attrition rates. And like \\"Starship Troopers\\", much of the novel is of people talking to one another about the universe they inhabit. This could have made the novel a boring mess, but Scalzi makes it interesting by making this universe interesting. He draws up characters rather than caricatures and you care about them, even as they are killed off one by one.<br /><br />The most original concept introduced in the novel is the idea of recruiting the old to fight humanity's enemies. He enhances the battle scenes of the novel by showing them from the perspective of a man who already lived out his normal lifespan, only to have another life dangled in front of him like a carrot....provided he survives. This provides a heightened sense of urgency to those battle scenes.<br /><br />There are plenty of other original concepts introduced within these pages, but all of them would be for naught if Scalzi didn't care about his characters. He does, and \\"Old Man's War\\" is a much better read for it.
B00068IOWC|1.0|I'm disappointed that the lowest rating Amazon has is 1 Star, because the assumption with one star is that there is something of any value on this album at all, which there is not. There really should be a \\"zero star\\" rating, or even \\"negative star\\" ratings for albums like this, which rise above and beyond simply being poorly written, but are also poorly executed as well.  <br /> <br />Both CD and DVD are just filler stuff for the bucks. Can this really be U2 ? I mean, almost every critic ( probably paid by U2 team ) have said \\"This is a return to classic U2, to old days\\" whatever, U2 never have been so sell out until now, that's completely different than the old U2 !!!!. Every media want to take a part of the U2's dinner anyway, that's the reason we'll always find the best reviews for them, no matter how safe it is. <br /> <br />Get rid of this. <br />My dad is probably rolling over in his grave because of what U2 has become. <br /> <br />Should I have to pay for this ? <br /> <br /> <br />...

These losers may have a few fans, but if you want real Metal you have to check out Korn and Limp Bizkit.  Those are the God Fathers of Metal.  Fred Durst is the greatest lyricist in the history of thye world.

It's got a Conan feel to it, but the music is pretty damn good. Manowar have their own unique sound, and this is their best CD ever by far. The songs here really stand out, but are very hard to describe. If you like the cover, you'll like the songs. <br /> <br />Not thrash...just metal. A few of these songs have given me chills at times because they are so incredibly visual with their sounds. Hearing songs makes me think of dragons and crap.

0385336810|5.0|The secret is out \\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\" is a hit.  The author is the same author who wrote all of the Shopaholics books, in this one she invents a new herione.   <br /> <br />Her name is Emma and while a lot of the writting is the same from her previous books, this character has her own sparkle about her.   <br /> <br />While I don't want to go into too many details and give up any of the great story line, I do want to reinstate to anyone who hasn't read this book to do so.  It is worth the money, it is a great story, and best of all it is re-readable.
B00064MW6A|2.0|While other reviews are preoccupied with what's bad about \\"Catwoman\\", I have to say the movie has its moments.  Yes, it's a bad movie, and it's not even bad in a good way.  Still, it has its moments. <br /> <br />I am a comic book fan, and I am especially a fan of Catwoman.  I really enjoyed Michelle Pfeiffer's take in \\"Batman Returns\\" and while I would prefer to have seen a continuation of her story, I kept an open mind when word spread that the new Catwoman movie would introduce an entirely new character.  I didn't join the throngs of comic book fanboys who screeched \\"It's not the comic book version!\\"  People seemed to forget that the Catwoman of \\"Batman Returns\\" bore very little resemblance to the comic book character in any of her various incarnations.  So, I continued to keep an open mind and resolved to judge the movie on its own merits. <br /> <br />First, Halle Berry does the best with what she has to work with.  A more than capable actress, she's appropriately mousy and likable as Patience.  As Catwoman, she's clearly into the role and having a lot of fun with it.  Yes, the costume is a bit, well, impractical, but then so are most costumes of comic book characters. <br /> <br />Contrary to what I've read in other reviews, I didn't think Sharon Stone, as villainess Laurel Hedare, came off all that badly.  Her character isn't entirely one-dimensional.  Stone plays Laurel with a hint of nihilism.  This is a woman who is victimized and clearly has nothing left to lose...only she's going to take out as many as she can with her. <br /> <br />CGI was necessary to give Catwoman the slinky, fluid motion to some of her action moves.  It is clunky and doesn't look too far removed from the graphics in the videogame tie-in.  Still, the action scenes are more than passable and enjoyable to watch.  Heck, if the entire movie could be re-edited down to the action sequences, that would be fine with me. <br /> <br />I have to give one negative comment about Lambert Wilson.  Gawd, was he bad.  Talk about one-dimensional.  And I really hated the overuse of speed motion photography and quick edits.  <br /> <br />\\"The Many Faces of Catwoman\\" feature on the disc is probably the best thing about the DVD release, though it would have been nice if the A&E Biography had been used instead of or in addition to this feature.
0440224764|4.0|Although some people wrote a review that the story was predictable, I couldn't see how.  The ending was something that I never thought was going to happen.  While the book followed Grisham wordiness as usual, the plot was as good as ever.
B00028HBKM|3.0|***1/2 Is it possible for anybody to be truly objective about Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion of the Christ\\"? Has any movie ever stirred up this much \\"passion\\" on both sides of any one issue? For here, indeed, is what might be termed the perfect Rorschach Test film.  As with the famed ink blots, people have a tendency to project onto this film all their innermost beliefs and biases - so much so that, in many cases, the comments individuals make about the film end up saying less about the movie and more about the people themselves.  Devout Christians embrace \\"The Passion\\" as the ultimate illustration of God's love for humanity, believing that by dramatizing so vividly the physical agony of Christ's last moments on Earth, the film brings home the high cost of the sacrifice in a way it has never been brought home before.  Since film is a largely visual and emotional medium, \\"The Passion\\" has an advantage - even over the gospel accounts themselves - of being able to convey the unimaginable brutality of 1st Century crucifixions and to make us vicarious participants in the suffering.  So passionately have some Christians taken this film to their bosoms that they have even equated attacks on the film with attacks on God.  On the other side of the cultural spectrum, many nonbelievers and skeptics see the film as a bewildering exercise in sadomasochistic savagery, as a man is basically tortured to death for two hours while millions of viewers worldwide queue up for the privilege of witnessing it.<br /><br />As an agnostic on the issue of Jesus myself, I confess that I can see both points of view fairly clearly, although, on the whole, I think \\"The Passion\\" is a pretty impressive cinematic achievement.  What makes this film different from most previous versions of the story - even more so than the unprecedented intensity of the movie's violence - is the fact that \\"The Passion\\" concentrates almost exclusively on the last few hours of Jesus' life.  By showing virtually nothing of Jesus' pre-passion ministry, the film does feel as if it is missing a fairly crucial dimension to the story.  Even the resurrection is treated almost as an afterthought - a bit of a cheat, actually, considering how much suffering both Jesus and the audience have had to endure up to that point.  Gibson attempts to filter bits and pieces of the back story into his movie through the use of very short flashbacks, but anyone unfamiliar with the gospel tale may find himself confused and bewildered and questioning what the purpose of all the suffering really is.  Perhaps unintentionally, the message of Jesus tends to get lost on the blood-soaked road to Calvary.<br /><br />Certainly it is the graphic nature of the violence that will be most remembered about this film and I think, in this respect, Gibson took basically the right approach.  The unflinching portrayal of Christ's suffering is infinitely preferable to the sanitized, \\"tasteful\\" way in which it has been depicted in most previous films on the subject.  It is possible that the director may be guilty of some overkill in this area (do we really need the crow pecking out the thief's eyes while he's dangling on the cross?), but, for the most part, the unremitting brutality is the film's strongest point.  It does lead us into questioning just why a loving god would require such a sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins, but, then, that is an issue for theologians, not a movie reviewer, to consider.<br /><br />As to the issue of whether or not the film is anti-Semitic in nature, that, too, depends on how one looks at it.  Surely, Jesus and his followers were all Jews and they, needless to say, are portrayed in only the most sympathetic light by the filmmakers.  Unfortunately, Caiphas and the other Jewish leaders in the film have been reduced to little more than stock villains, shaking their fists at the camera and crying irrationally for Jesus' blood all throughout the picture.  However, since this is the way the story is told in the gospels, the charge of anti-Semitism is virtually unavoidable in any movie dealing with Jesus' life.  For the same reason, Pontius Pilate comes across in the film as a much more reasonable, conscience-wracked victim of circumstance than historians like Josephus would ever have portrayed him.<br /><br />One can also question the decision on Gibson's part to add Satan to his cast of characters in the guise of a hooded, hissing, androgynous figure more appropriate to a cheap horror film than a serious drama.  Of course, one can understand why Gibson felt compelled to do this.  After all, by limiting himself solely to the passion scene, he must have realized that he was left with no opportunities to portray any of the neat miracles Jesus is said to have performed.  Thus, the director had to find a way to inject something of the supernatural into the proceedings; otherwise the film might have come across as just a movie about a guy being pounded to a pulp by a bunch of misguided sadists.<br /><br />On a technical level, Gibson has done a superb job recreating the time and place of the story, with his inspired use of Aramaic and Latin lending a harsh reality to the scene.  The makeup work is truly extraordinary and cinematographer Caleb Deschanel brings out the stark beauty of the ancient background against which this gruesome drama is played.  As Jesus, Jim Caviezel cuts an impressive figure and sure shows that he can take a punch with the best of them.  Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene, Francesco De Vito as Peter and Hristo Jivkov as John get to do little but look teary-eyed and concerned as Jesus makes his way through the crowd.  Hristo Shopov brings some humanity to the role of Pilate, though Luca de Dominicus makes of Herod a mincing, campy caricature.<br /><br />There is a certain irony in the fact that the most commercially successful R-rated feature to date has achieved that prominence largely through the patronage of people who have been the most vocal critics of such films.  Perhaps the Lord does indeed work in mysterious ways.<br /><br />As films about the life of Jesus, I much prefer Passolini`s \\"The Gospel According to St. Matthew\\" and Zeffirelli`s \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" to Gibson`s \\"The Passion of the Christ,\\" but this latest version of the tale, despite its many flaws, brings its own unique vision to \\"the greatest story ever told.\\"is told in the gospels, the charge of anti-Semitism is virtually unavoidable in any movie dealing with Jesus' life.

B00064MW6A|1.0|The only time I write a review is when a film is so horrendous that it warrants attention.  I find that the professional film critics can't be trusted; they don't seem to like anything entertaining.  I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to movies.  Some are great, deserving of awards.  Others are just entertainment.  This movie is supposed to fit in with the later.  It's not going to win any awards - it's a 'popcorn' movie.  Alright, so what happened?  Horrible script and amature direction.  Plain and simple.  The actors do a fine job but just can't overcome the script.  And I haven't seen direction like this since.....well, watching amature films.  I was highly disapointed in this movie.  I do enjoy the 'superhero/comic book' movies.  I know what to expect going in, not an award winner, but at least something that doesn't have me shaking my head, feeling embarassed to be watching it, and contemplating turning it off.  The reason for the one star is because I was able to complete it, albeit with great difficulty.  There is very little I will turn off -'Starship Troopers 2' comes to mind as the turn off and go to bed type of film....this was close.

But I hadn't seen it for years when I recently got a hold of it and watched it with my 13 year old son. And this baby holds up! The music is still fresh and electrifying; Byrne's passion, artistry, and honestly still shine in his amazing performance; and Demme's mastery in capturing the here and now of the experience pull the viewer irresistably in. It's an astonishing piece of work.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|I know the common belief in Hollywood is that all action movies should be an hour and a half because Americans have really small attention spans. Well, I thank God for director's cuts. Especially for this film because when I saw the original version it honestly seemed rushed and I left feeling like I saw something that looked cool but who the heck was that guy in the red suit? <br /> <br />I was so glad to see more emphasis put on Matt Murdock. Because of the extended and new scenes I got a clearer picture of why he became a lawyer and Daredevil in the first place. The supporting characters also get more filled out in this version. I adored the scene with Bullseye going through airport security. Now that should have been in the original version but I'm glad it's here and that I got to see it. <br /> <br />This Daredevil Cut is longer but the extra time allows for not only more plot and character development but, surprisingly, more action. Yep, even the action movie's fight scenes were cut down in the original version. I was especially impressed by the extended Elektra/Daredevil/Bullseye rooftop fights and Daredevil's bar room brawl. Trust me this is the one you should own.
B000002J1Y|4.0|This 1973 live recording shows a few technical signs of its age, and yet it is a gem of Yes's early years.  There are some places where the sound quality is less than stellar, and yet 1973 was when Yes was young and energetic and had a bold artistic vision that sometimes met with the approval and critics and fans, and just as often did not.  What remains is that Yes had sufficient success to be experimental in their music and the talent to frequently turn their experiments into interesting music.<br /><br />The opening of the first CD is a portion of Stravinsky's \\"Firebird Suite.\\"  Opening live albums with an instrumental portion has been done by other artists with varying success, and this introduction seems a bit underpowered, though well performed.  The opening leads to \\"Siberian Khatru,\\" which is similarly well performed.  The weakness of this track is that the bass seems too subdued and the high notes a bit strong, even with my speakers biased towards the lower notes.<br /><br />The album continues with \\"Heart of the Sunrise,\\" again well performed, sounding a lot like the original album, with the exception that Jon Anderson's voice in live performances often sounds much less polished than his studio performances.  \\"Perpetual Change\\" follows with fourteen plus minutes of rock.  Again, the instruments are the power as Jon's voice often fades to a much lower volume or into the background.<br /><br />\\"And You and I\\" has a strong opening that is easily heard.  The live version offers some variation from the studio version.  Jon's vocal is a little strange as it appears his voice was varying in volume, particularly during the opening, though his singing on this song is otherwise well done, stronger and smoother than on the earlier tracks.  Indeed, the vocals in general are stronger on this track than on the previous tracks, though Jon fails to hold a long note at about five minutes into the track.  This song is classic Yes and includes everything that was ever good about progressive rock.<br /><br />A change of pace is provided by the acoustic guitar instrumental \\"Mood for a Day.\\"  Surprisingly, this song sounds better than the studio version.  The combination of the crowd sounds with the slight echo from performing in a large area and the variation in playing all make this instrumental a gem.<br /><br />Rick Wakeman, who established himself as an experimental solo artist, plays excerpts from \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII.\\"  As those who have heard \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" can attest, Rick Wakeman's music translates well when played live.  While I am unsure why, the result is nearly always impressive, and this instrumental impresses me even now.  Crank up the volume on this one, just make sure that everything loose is tied down, particularly if you have a sub-woofer and you've got the bass cranked all the way up to maximum and most especially in the last minute of the music.<br /><br />\\"Roundabout,\\" one of Yes's numerous signature songs, takes up the last eight and a half minutes of the first CD.  The transition from the previous track to this one is seamless, and you hardly know you are into the next song until the guitars start, and of course \\"Roundabout\\" is instantly recognizable.  Once again, the music is good, the vocals are only fair.<br /><br />The second CD starts with yet another signature Yes song, \\"I've Seen All Good People.\\"  This seven minute track is the shortest song on this CD, and features good vocals, both by Jon Anderson and the backing vocals.  This track is one of the best on this CD and offers a worthwhile variation from the studio album.<br /><br />The next track combines \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" with \\"The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus).\\"  This thirteen minute track starts as you would expect it to, but about two-thirds way through the track this song diverts substantially from the studio track and explodes into a rousing rock explosion before returning once again to the music of \\"The Fish.\\"The end of this track is a lot of fun also.<br /><br />\\"Close to the Edge\\" consists of more than eighteen minutes of rock explorations that follow the original studio version.  The sound on this song is generally good and enjoyable to hear.  The vocals are surprisingly good as well.  As good an eighteen minutes of live progressive rock as you'll hear anywhere.  \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" follows with yet another fourteen plus minutes of enjoyable progressive rock.  It seems the further into the second disk you go the better the music gets.  The guitar work on this song is well done and interesting and enjoyable to listen to.<br /><br />The last song is yet another signature Yes song.  \\"Starship Troopers\\" was loosely inspired by the Robert A. Heinlein novel by the same name.  This last song, clocking in at more than 10 minutes, is an excellent way to end this CD.  The music is well performed and the vocals, while a bit weak in a couple of places, are generally good.  The ending of this song shows Yes at their playful best.<br /><br />I am rarely fond of live albums.  Often the production values are much less than studio albums, and there are sufficient flaws to render the music grating.  While this live album suffers from some flaws, most particularly in the vocals, the music itself is good, and the music on the second CD is very good.  I count this live CD as one of the better live CDs I have heard and own.

B00064MW6A|4.0|I'm one of those kind of comic book fans that see a comic book film and expect to see everything in the movie that's in the comic. I believed that every comic book based film should be as great as Spiderman or X-Men. <br /> <br />Then there are movies like Catwoman where the plot isn't as strong as Spiderman, the characters aren't as interesting as the X-Men, and the action isn't as great as the Matrix. And so what. Catwoman is an example of a good old fashioned adventure movie. It's the story of a woman who dies, is ressurected by an ancient cat, and seeks revenge against her murderer. Simple, basic, uncomplicated. That kind of movie where you don't need a dictionary or a psychiatric degree to figure stuff out. <br /> <br />It's easy to point out the bad but let's look at the good. It's an action film with a female lead and I'm sorry to say because we really should be beyond that whole issue but it's also an important point that she is a black female lead. It's funny, it's sexy, it's exciting, and the story may not be Oscar calibur but it doesn't suck. And as a Catwoman fan I was glad that though there were some crazy changes the essence of the character remained true. She was still independent, fearless, and had the whip, ha ha.  <br /> <br />If anything I wish that Sharon Stone had more scenes. I think she was great as the really bad girl. I also loved that she wasn't one dimensional. She represented those beautiful women who are deemed obsolete when compared to some 18 year old fetus tripping down the runway. She was as much a victim as Patience. And Patience's friend Sally was great. Would've loved to seen more of her.  <br /> <br />So Catwoman is a great, fun movie that actually has a couple of important moral lessons to teach and I hope there is a sequel!

Hawkins, and Sin&eacute;ad O'Conner, Dido has her own style.<br /><br />This CD opens with \\"Here with Me,\\" a heartfelt song of longing and love.  The delicate music with Dido's soulful voice sends shivers down my spine.  This song is haunting and ethereal, and deeply emotional, establishing the theme for this CD.<br /><br />All the delicacy is gone with the feral song \\"Hunter.\\"  Dido has gone from singing about the person she wants to be with her to telling her love interest that she wants to be on the hunt again, away from him.  Dido's voice is quiet, yet assured.  She is asking him to let her go, yet you sense from the vocals that while she is providing him with the opportunity, she will do it eventually with or without his approval.  She is the hunter.<br /><br />The third track is another relationship phase: after the breakup.  The lyrics seem a bit strange after the heartfelt vocals of longing in the first song and the cat on the prowl strength of the third song.  In this song she is more simpering and petty and thinking way too much about him.  Given the strength of character in the first two songs, this song seems out of character.<br /><br />The next song, \\"My Lover's Gone,\\" brings Dido back on track.  This time she sings the loss of her lover.  The lyrics are poignant and mournful.  The emotion she brings to her voice matches the lyrics well.  The haunting instruments supporting the vocals are in sync rather than counterpoint.  The music and instruments are delicate and misty, and have a Celtic quality to them, combining modern musical elements with an airy new age style.<br /><br />Keeping with melancholy themes is a song to a departed lover in \\"All You Want.\\"  The harmonies and the lyrics are the highlight of this composition.  On the one hand Dido laments the loss of her lover, but she also does not accept that he left for another woman, and essentially says that he made his bed, and he can sleep in it.  As in most of the previous songs she remains, while upset and regretful, in control.<br /><br />The next song did well on the charts, and is a pretty song about how someone can brighten a person's life.  Dido's vocals are electronically manipulated to increase the complexity of this song, with overdubs and echo.  This pop song is bright and friendly and has a catchy beat that combine to make this one of the most radio friendly songs on the CD.  This song is also likely to show up in movies, if it has yet to do so.<br /><br />Getting back to a more melancholy tone is \\"Honestly OK.\\"  The topic is loneliness and feeling the need to share life with someone.  There is a sharp beat to this song that shows some hip-hop influence, though not in the vocals.  This song turns depression into emotional art.<br /><br />\\"Slide\\" brings to mind Sade.  The sumptuous mellow vocal overlays and the vocal style are reminiscent of some of Sade's music.  Once again Dido's voice takes charge of the song and the subject, which is dealing with mistakes and the every day tribulations of life.  The electronic touches are subdued and supportive and provide an interesting and unique feel.  The drums retain just a touch of island beat, again similar to some of Sade's music.  However, in the end this song is Dido's.<br /><br />The ninth track is melancholic, and yet the song keeps itself about a maudlin level to provide an enjoyable listening experience.  \\"Isobel\\" is about love, regret and quiet resentment.  It is amazing that Dido can sing about loving someone more who is in the process of going away, but that is where she found strength to carry on.<br /><br />\\"I'm no Angel\\" says that regardless of whether she is an angel, she tries hard to do the right thing.  The lyrics are interesting and well performed.  However, it seems that the vocal style is less in charge and Dido seems to struggle just a little to keep up with the instruments.  Because of the power of the other songs on this CD we know she has the ability, so it is perception rather than fact.  The result is that vocally this track is one of the weaker ones on this CD.<br /><br />Dido reasserts herself lyrically and vocally in \\"My Life.\\"  Dido could have sang this song with a regretful tone, as though she is breaking up with someone or has differences with someone that are causing her to do something she does not want to do.  Instead she says she does what she does because she is in charge of herself.  The steady beat is assured and is beautifully and quietly executed musically.  This song also seems to reflect Dido's true personality, which shows up in earlier songs.  Perhaps this song also dares anyone to criticize her music, advising everyone that this music is who she is and she cares not what anyone says about it.<br /><br />\\"Take My Hand\\" is a deep song, expressing the empathy that someone can have for another for whom they care deeply.  When you are that deeply in love for someone there can be no lies because the emotions are plain to see; a wonderful and pretty song with a fast beat that proclaims the depths love can achieve.  The music and the vocals in this song are strong to underscore the strength of the singer's love.<br /><br />Listen to this album without distractions, because these songs are emotional and complex.  The music is beautiful, the lyrics are well written.  The few moments of weakness are well outweighed by the strength of the remaining songs.  This excellent album is for those who like Sarah McLachlan, Sophie B. Hawkins and perhaps even Enya.is less in charge and Dido seems to struggle just a little to keep up with the instruments.

B0006IIPIK|1.0|bad screenplay, poor actings, terrible directing, editing. <br />even by comic book standard, this is so bad a movie that almost made me kill myself during watching. the plot is so contrite, the acting so pretentious, the whole movie is just like watching a junkyard, full of copycatting indiana jones, star wars, juraissic park, lord of the ring... whatever other unnamed movies junks coming up to your mind. so many scenes looked so familiar as seen in the other scifi or fantasy movies. none of the actors had put 1% of the heart into it. so un-thrilled, uninspired, uninterested, so bored. my god, shall i continue my blabbing?
0684135051|5.0|I am a next-step knitter--I've made my share of scarves, a few baby hats on the one set of circular needles I own, and even a pair of mittens, with my nose glued to a book.  I felt the need to move on, so I picked up Elizabeth's book (we are on first-name basis now) and finally shed my fear of my knitting.  I just get it now.  I can do this.  The percentage method and gague information finally make sense.  Sweaters don't need to be bags with too-long sleeves and too-short bodies.  I can make them fit, and lovely too, with the yarn I have.  Now I understand.  Thank you.
0790729369|4.0|To those reviews centering on the \\"immorality\\" of not only the protagonists in this film, but the author of the novel, and the \\"Hollywood Establishment\\", I say this - you're missing the entire point. If \\"romance\\", \\"infidelity\\", and \\"lost love\\" are central themes of this film, then I suggest adding \\"human fallibility\\" to the list. Francesca and Robert ARE good people, who like all of us, are fallible. If they were not, then Francesca's decision wouldn't have been so difficult, and heart wrenching. Indeed, if she were truly selfish, and \\"immoral\\", she would have left her family immediately, and without hesitation.  <br /> <br />Much of human behavior (and morality too) cannot be realistically assessed in black and white terms. Francesca and Robert are neither completely \\"bad\\", nor \\"good\\". They are decent individuals who happened to meet too late in life, in the wrong place, and thus, must suffer the consequences of these tragic, unfortunate circumstances. It's not Francesca and Robert vs. her family.    <br /> <br />The emotional complexity of the storyline, the surprisingly good match up between Eastwood and Streep, and not to be overlooked - a fantastic soundtrack - make for a film I'd definitely recommend. <br />
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is a Wonderful Soundtrack. I wake up to it every morning. I definately recommend this if you haven't seen the show because both Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth are not in it anymore.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|What an amazing concept. Imagine you're Bob Geldof. You've just made a kickass movie as the alter ego of Roger Waters in Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall.\\" Your band, The Boomtown Rats, is doing pretty damn well. So now what? Go to Africa, get millions of dollars for starving people, and make your concert the most memorable in history. Not too shabby, eh? <br />   I am 16 and wasn't alive during Live Aid. I love this DVD. There is over 12 HOURS of stuff! Some of the great bands at this concert were: U2, Queen, David Bowie, The Who, Elton John, Paul McCartney, The Boomtown Rats, and George Michael. The list goes on and on, but those were my favorites. <br />   Some of the true HIGHLIGHTS on this DVD: <br />    DVD 1: The Boomtown Rats do \\"I Don't Like Mondays.\\" Bob Geldof has the audience eating out of the palm of his charitable hand. He is absolutely spellbinding. LOVE HIM!! SIDE NOTE: PEOPLE, WATCH THE MOVIE SPICE WORLD! YES, YOU MAY WANT TO DIE WATCHING IT, BUT BOB'S IN IT, AND SO IS ELTON JOHN! GO FIGURE!  <br />    *Elvis Costello: \\"All You Need is Love\\" was awesome!    <br />    *U2 were absolutely amazing! In the song, \\"Bad,\\" Bono goes out into the crowd pit and picks 3 girls to dance with! I shiver and smile at that! Imagine being one of those girls!! Kudos, U2! <br />   DVD 2: CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH: QUEEN!!!! They stole the show for me! You can just see the excitement in the audience when Freddie and Company parade onstage! I bought the DVD because of them! Breathtaking! <br />    *David Bowie: Is there anything this man CAN'T do?! His faster rendition of \\"TVC15\\" is 10X better than his version on his album. His haunting performance of \\"Heroes\\" is great too. <br />    *The Who: All I can say about them that hasn't been said is: GOOD GOD, how old was Roger Daltrey here? He is more ripped than most people in their 20's!! Brava, Roger. You caught my attention. <br />    *Elton John/George Michael: Elton is always amazing, but I have to give it up to George! His voice is just awesome! His version of \\"Don't Let the Sun...\\" is superb. Not a fault there. <br />   DVD 3: *Freddie Mercury and Brian May, \\"Is This the World We Created?\\" I cried a little. Haunting, simply, heartbreaking. <br />      *Paul McCartney, \\"Let it Be.\\" It seems the audience doesn't know it's him until the lights come up. Their reaction is the best next to Queen in the whole concert. He plays, with the help of backing vocals from Bowie, Geldof, and Pete Townshend. This gives way to the Band Aid, \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\" which is awesome!!! Every performer comes out and sings. Notably, Sting (who i didn't mention earlier, but did an awesome job!), Bono, Bowie, Geldof, George Michael, and... EVERYONE ELSE!!! <br />   I have to be honest, every band I liked played in London, so I skipped the rest. Well, I watched Madonna, Black Sabbath, Duran Duran, and Phil Collins who flew his ass from London to Phili to perform AGAIN!!! Best Spirit Award to Phil!! <br />   DVD 4: WATCH THE DOCUMENTARY!!!! It's about 1 hour long, and goes through the whole process of Live Aid. Simply elaborate, which makes no sense, but for this it does. I found Bob's short conversation with the, excuse me England, bitch Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher particularily interesting. She had no care about Africa at ALL!!! Hey, neither did Regan! No one did but the pop stars! YAY! GO POP STARS!! Funny side note for anyone who cares: There are two \\"Aids\\" that raise more money before the real Live Aid. One is a comedy show in London. What I loved was Monty Python's Michael Palin is in it. I love him and all Monty Python! Hey, any Python fans in NYC need to go see the Play \\"Spamalot\\" coming direct from Chi-Town in a month! HILARIOUS! Ahem, anyway, the other great thing was the Fashion show the rock stars did. What I found so damn funny was Freddie Mercury was walking down the aisle in a weird tux with his BRIDE!! He must have been laughing at the world inside!! Too great! <br />    BUY THIS DVD,I CANNOT SAY THAT ENOUGH!!!! FOR 30 DOLLARS OR 17 POUNDS, ALL THE MONEY STILL GOES TO AFRICA! AND THAT MAKES YA FEEL GOOD INSIDE! SUPPORT A GOOD CAUSE! MAKE BOB PROUD!
B00064MW6A|1.0|You know the movie is going to be good when you want to watch the special features first. Every critic said this movie was awful and for once the critics got it right. From start to finish (and you are waiting for that finish), this movie stinks worse than kitty litter. With that said, it does have a great documentary on the history of Catwoman and how she has evolved in the comics, tv and movies. I am a comic fan, but that isn't why I hated the movie because I have always loved movies more than comics. I hated the movie because it was God awful and should have never seen the light of day. Why Bratt took a role in this thing I have no idea. Maybe he just wanted some screen time with Stone and Berry. I don't know how this movie got made, and I just pray we won't have to see Catwoman 2: Back in the Litter Box. Here's to crossing your fingers that Batman Begins will live up to the hype.

B0006B2A2E|5.0|A film by Michel Gondry<br /><br />From the very creative mind of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman comes \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\", one of the best movies of 2004.  The narrative is kind of disjointed, but that is par for the course with a Kaufman script.  The first scenes of the movie are really from quite a bit later chronologically, but at first we do not know quite how these first scenes fit into the story or why.  Not long into the movie we learn that Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) had a relationship, but when it ended Clementine decided to have a new procedure done which can remove a person's memories of another person (or another thing).  So, as far as Clementine now knows, she and Joel have never met.  When Joel learns about this he has the same procedure done to remove all memories of Clementine.<br /><br />At this point, the movie loses all sense of chronology, but it is makes more sense.  The following scenes are Joel's memories as they are being erased, so his unconscious is reliving the memories and remembering both the good and the bad of his relationship with Clementine.  At some point Joel decides that these are memories he doesn't want to lose.  \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is a very original look at love and relationships and what it could mean to really try and make a relationship work.  The film is uncompromising in how it reveals Joel and Clementine, but at the same time it is very tender and sweet.  Co-starring Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, and Kirstin Dunst, the movie never makes a wrong turn.  With a subject that could easily have mad a very bad movie, Michel Gondry instead makes a very good one.  In a refreshing change of pace Jim Carrey plays the straight man to Kate Winslet's far crazier Clementine.<br /><br />\\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is one of the most original, well acted, and simply excellent movies of the year.  It deserves a place on any critics Top 10 list and is well worth watching.  Grade: A-<br /><br />-Joe Sherrywatching.  Grade: A- <br /> <br />-Joe Sherry

B0006213WG|1.0|This band sucks.  They are horrible, all they do  is scream and whine in their songs, and then swear every other ten seconds to act tough.  Its so annoying, get Papa Roach  or SOcial Distortrion if ;you like good rock.  Dont buy these cds. This band sucks.
B0006399FS|4.0|Hands down the album is great. Is it their best? Probably not. It is a bit safe compared to Achtung Baby! and Pop, which I consider to be their best and their gutsiest albums to date. They were a band that took chances and weren't afraid to take on the world, but this album is far from a sellout or stale. If the band was a sellout then they would have tried to duplicate the Joshua Tree which is probably their greatest selling album, but that is not the case. I find this to be more of a ATYCLB pt 2, but it is far from mediocre.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I dont wanna give this a great review since i didnt like it that much but it was okay.  Most of their songs are pretty good, but some of them are not that good.  Not bad, just not good.  But its still a great cd!
0345350499|4.0|There are many women characters established  in the Arthurian legends. Up until now there have been authors that have taken on this classic mythology through the males point of view. But this retelling narrates the book from the ladies of the Arthurian legends side of the story....And it's about time.<br /><br />Marion Zimmer Bradley has created a new, refreshed identity for the Ladies of Camelot and Avalon. The book examines the events of the mythos from the females perspective.  Many of these characters have, until now, been portrayed as wives, seductresses,  enchantresses, and harlots. But this new take identifies the women of Camelot in different and less derogatory roles; that of mother, daughter, sister, lover, priestess, queen, and friend.<br /><br />There are several different generations of phenomenal characters that make up the greater tapestry of this book.<br /><br />Viviane- Lady of the Lake at Avalon, the holy isle dedicated to the Goddess.  It is her visions that influence the shaping of the future of Britain in the most unusual ways.<br /><br />Igraine- Viviane's younger half sister, daughter of Taliesin the Merlin, and wife to the Romanized Duke of Cornwall. She bends her will to whatever her sister asks of her, even if it means to sacrifice her own virtue.<br /><br />Morgause- Igraine's younger sister and Viviane's half sister. Destined for more than to rot in isolated Tintagel, her ambitions take her to the northern Isles of Orkney where she makes the appropriate sacrifices to affirm her place in this tale.<br /><br />Morgaine- daughter of Igraine and the Duke of Cornwall. She is taken to serve the Goddess at a young age by Viviane, but renounces her position as the next Lady of the Lake when Viviane's visions prove too much for her to endure.<br /><br />Gwenhwyfar- Pious and virtuous she longs to Christianize Arthur`s court and purge the followers of the goddess from the realm. But she is unable to reconcile her feelings for Lancelet for what is good for the future of Britain. She longs desperately to give Arthur the heir the country needs and she is unable to produce.<br /><br />Elaine- Daughter of Pellinore, and Gwenhwyfar's cousin. She is desperate to gain Lancelet's admiration and love, even if she has to resort to \\"Sorcery\\" to attain it, or give up her first born daughter to the Goddess.<br /><br />Raven- Priestess of Avalon and friend of Morgaine, she has undertaken a vow of silence, but always seems to prophesize what is to come at just the right moment.<br /><br />Niniane- Daughter of Taliesin the Merlin. The successor to the Lady of the Lake and lover to Gwydion. What does one really feel when they know they are second choice to another?<br /><br />Nimue- Daughter of Elaine and Lancelet. Destined to fulfill her mother's vow and take her place in Avalon under Niniane's teachings, she must give herself up to the Merlin of Britain in order to implement Morgaine's visions, but can she keep herself from losing herself to him as well?<br /><br />The story is mostly told from Morgaine's perspectives.  This character is largely influential on the events that occur throughout the story, either through her premonitions that come by way of the Sight or the enforcement of her unassailable will. Many of the cruxes in the story come from the juxtaposition of Morgaine And Gwenhwyfar, who serve as symbols of the struggles of the two religions in the story, the Christians and the Celts. Both spend the better part of the book applying the men as tools in order to establish their respective religions as the dominant moral force in Britain. Through their struggles the classic events prevalent to the Arthurian tales are expressed in a new manner, many with Celtic twists on them. I don't want to spoil the retelling of the conception of Mordred, the quest for the Holy Grail, or the romantic love trials that came as unexpected surprises to me, even though I have read several different authors takes on this classic mythology. Rest assured, this was the best version I have read to date, one that reinvented the Arthurian legends .best version I have read to date, one that reinvented the Arthurian legends .

B0000029DD|5.0|Many people read great reviews about Jeff Buckley and are disappointed.  Why? Because Jeff Buckley is different.  He was a composer, not just a songwriter.  He envisioned and composed every aspect of every song.  He was an artist capable of creating great compositions and surprisingly allowed to do so by Columbia Records.  Some listeners may have expected something that was more commercial, easier to listen to, something simpler.  His melodies are no more meandering than Robert Plant's.  It is his vocal style.  His music is complex and crafted, not thrown together in 20 minutes at 4am.  Jeff Buckley is not for the casual listener, but if you truly appreciate music and the originality of a unique artist that wasn't influenced by a  desire to be entirely mainstream and processed.  So if you base your CD purchases on MTV's or VH1's top 10 music videos, this CD probably isn't for you.
038551123X|5.0|This book really IS as good as everyone who likes it says.  The start is a bit waffly - don't be put off by the first chapter, keep going and it gets better and better. The strictly moral serial killer, who does society a service by dispatching evildoers - simple concept, but it hasn't been done this well since Blackburn: A Novel by Bradley Denton. (If you liked DDD, read Blackburn - it's very different, but you'll enjoy it.) <br /> <br />Dexter, however, is divinely and uniquely quirky. A blood-splatter pattern expert, he talks naturally of 'a splay of police cars' or 'a clot of police officers' gathered around a body. He's cool, sardonic, with an eye for the irony or ridiculous. Though regarding himself as 'inhuman', he's a superb political animal, attuned to the police department games & the nuances of his conniving colleagues, calmly on a knife edge between work and 'play'.  <br /> <br />Throughout the chaotic and totally entertaining criminal investigations, which are hard to describe without giving too much away, runs the reassurance of the Wisdom of Harry. The late Harry, Dexter's wise & worldly foster father, recognized the 'beast' in Dexter, teaching him to channel it towards those we would be better off without. The Wisdom of Harry also taught him how to be inconspicious and appear normal and in control, lessons which have seen Dexter well through many, many murders - but which include nothing about what to do when the dreams start... <br /> <br />Fun. Creepy. Gripping. Clever. I envy those of you about to read it for the first time...
B0002JJBZY|4.0|As others have indicated the series must get five stars, but this DVD distribution must cost it at least a star.  The transfer quality stinks.  The disks themselves are assembled in a flimsy plastic wallet with a flimsy plastic spine.  The menus are the worst part. There is no play all button anywhere. There are long menu delays between you and your voyage. There are annoying switches regarding optional voice-over narration, not off the main menu, but stuck right in the middle of the episode selection dialogue, to get in your face every time you browse.

1400043662|4.0|Please permit me to first state that I am true Murakami fan. I have found all of his works more than enjoyable, and wish that I could read \\"Wind Up Bird\\" and \\"Norwegian Wood\\" for the first time ad infinitum. This said, \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" was a bit of a disappointment, and yet it is still Murakami and therefore deserves four stars. <br /> <br />My general feeling about this book was that Murakami felt like he had not gotten his point across in his other works, and hence, wrote this story trying to reiterate all of his old themes into this new piece. Foremost, Murakami is obsessed with the idea that as we move through life we leave some that is essential to our being behind. We go through a process of recognizing this. This process is takes us on a journey that is very much like an absurd detective story to find what has been lost and eventually come to terms with it. <br /> <br />This is exactly what \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" does. It is a mix between \\"Wind Up Bird\\" (reference to wells and Japan's military past) and the \\"End of the World\\" portion of \\"Hardboiled Wonderland . . .\\" (shadows). Yet, the story does not leave the reader with the same sense of empathy for the protaganist that is so common across his other novels. For example, while \\"Dance Dance Dance\\" lacked the depth of other works, it was immensely entertaining and empathetic. This is \\"Kafka's\\" true downfall. Nevertheless, as the days have gone by since reading the story, the reader is still left with the contemplative sensation as with any of his other works. <br /> <br />Finally, I was a bit confused by his literary references. In the first half of story, Murakami's characters discuss important Japanese authors. Then he moves toward Greek mythology, and finally popular Western Music (leaving the Japanese behind). At first, I thought he was trying to make his novel truly Japanese to thwart criticism of being too Westernized. But, then he abandons the Japenese references altogether and moves completely to theWest. Hmmm? <br /> <br />But, if you are a true Murakami fan, read \\"Kafka on the Shore\\". You may be a bit disappointment, but it's still Haruki. If you've never read him before, then, there's nothing to lose.

The music is repetative and monotonous and the singer just annoys me with his shocking lyrics. There is no meaning behind the lyrics just poor music. I've studied music for the majority of my life and I know what talent is and this band seriously lacks it. I Don't see how anyone can be a \\"fan\\" of this band, they obviously have no respect for music. Listen to \\"Atomship - The Crash Of 47\\" if you want talent in this genre.

B00005JLEU|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki is a geneous in anime. This movie has beautiful graphics and a really well thought out storyline. Its about a little girl Chihiro and her parents move to a new town and get lost when trying to find thier new house. They think they see thier house on a hill top so they drive up there. They enter an abandoned town where food is cooking by itself, so the girls hungry parents run to go eat it. The food turns the girls parents to pigs, and the girl finds out she is not in a human town. <br />     Humans arent really excepted in this town, but Chihiro needs to get hers parents back. She ends up having to work in a bath house, while try to find a way to get her parents back to human before its too late. Ive had this movie since it first came out in April 2003 and probably watched it 25 times. I just love all of miyazaki's work epecially totoro. ive had totoro for a little over ten years and totoro never gets old either. I think this movie is enjoyable for everyone. <br />     The second disc has the making of this movie,which is really really interesting. I didnt really like special feature showing how the american dub was done though. This is an unbelievable movie, its hard to only watch once, i prefer buying it.
6305508550|5.0|The ability of almost anybody to relate to this movie help elevate this movie to a cult classic. Upon the release of this movie, Twentieth Century Fox spent almost no money for promotion. In spite of this through word of mouth it has become an unbelievable success. Dealing with issues that almost anyone to relate to, relationships, dim-witted bosses, unruly electronics, frustration with the redundancy of bureaucracy, etc. has helped elevate this film to a cult classic. This is one of the few movies that can be watched and enjoyed over and over again. Save yourself the money of repeatedly renting it and the aggravation of waiting for it to appear on network or cable television and add it to your dvd collection.
B00005B36H|5.0|what an awesome album. i got it a couple monthes ago and i listen to it very frequently. its soo deep in meaning unlike alot of crappy bands and rap. maynard is a mastermind when it comes to lyrics. maynard knows what good music is from crap and thats why he's made soo many quality cds in tool and a perfect circle. the only album of his i disliked was eMOTIVE, but it has some good songs. this album is great and i cant see why someone would dislike it. Tool is one of the most phoenomenal bands of the nineties and countuinues on today. i hope a new tool album comes out this year as expected but maynard being in apc slowed down tool. if you have never heard tool before, i suggest listen to these songs from lateralus, these are my favorites:    The Grudge    Schism    Parabol    Parabola    Ticks & Leeches    Lateralis      you will never regret buying this cd, its a unbelievable. even the art is great,it features art by Alex Grey which features the layers of the human body. tool has much more meaning than rap, its deep. i hope people see the true beauty of tool.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Boy, was I hoping to hate this CD.  First, I've never liked Christina because I think that moreso than Mariah, Whitney, Jessica Simpson, or Patti - she comes across a belting showoff with no sense of humor or modulation.  Second, the first single (Dirrty) was a mess of overdone industrial hip hop beats and shouting.  But the full record proved me wrong.  Pound for pound, song for song, it is top-notch diva pop - mixing in a little Latin rhythm here, old school soul there, and a few terrific self empowering message ballads to boot - all well-sequenced to make a CD you can listen to straight through without your finger on the skip button.  The singing is confident and the songs are just soooooo good - well written with good chord changes.  The Mariah and Whitney comeback CDs would have killed for these songs.  Just too strong to ignore. \\"Cruz\\", \\"Infatuation\\", \\"Impossible\\" - these songs weren't even singles.  This CD is probably 10 deep with potential radio hits! Two plus years later - it still holds up nicely.   <br /> <br />Usually with pop artists, many fans wait and wait to buy a 'greatest hits' that collects all the single over the course of several albums (perhaps I should have done this with Britney, for example!).  But this CD is practically a 'greatest hits' all on its own - you'd be missing alot of decent stuff if you passed on this full release just to get \\"Beautiful\\" later.  Hey, I'm even getting used to \\"Dirrty\\".
B0002X314C|5.0|Get this CD!  This is one of the best CD's I have ever heard.  John Legend has an amazing voice and the lyrics are so real and true.  I have not stopped listening to 'Get Lifted' since I bought it.  I have a copy for home and my car.  His background singers are astounding as well.  If you want real soulful from the heart music, John Legend's \\"Get Lifted\\" is for you.  Just push play, no need to skip any tracks.  John Legend, you did an amazing job on the album.  I wish I could give it 50 stars.
B00064MW6A|1.0|At a time when comic book movies have actually found some substance, \\"catwoman\\" is clearly a step--a plunge in the wrong direction.  I was rooting for Berry, and was hoping for a good action flick, it is a comic book movie after all.  What I found was sorely disappointing on various levels. <br />To begin, the movie does not even come close to following the comic book ethos but more importantly it is so predictable and cliche-riddled it makes it barely watchable.  I found myself flinching at various ill-directed scenes.  The French director, a self described \\"master of digital photography\\" is clearly confused on how to re-make an ultra-hip urban catwoman.  The cheap attempts at substance, like explaining the empowerment of women through catwomen in history is almost laughable if not so insulting to one's intelligence.  I am sorry, but if I could give it no stars, I would.
B0000025RI|5.0|It is absolutely no wonder why Michael Jackson is so well known once you listen to this album. This is, without a shadow of a doubt, THE ultimate album. Once you listen to this album, you'll also have no questions about how it is the top selling albums of all time.    Of course, people have been saying \\"The Eagles: Their Greatest Hits\\" have topped Thriller. After having a hell of a time searching for the worldwide sales of Eagles: Their Greatest Hits, I discovered that no, the Eagles album DID NOT top Thriller. Thriller sold 55 million worldwide, the Eagles: Their Greatest Hits sold 42 million. It turns out many people are saying the Eagles top MJ because they got the best sales in America. Apparently, all you need to do to get the title of \\"Best Selling Album of All Time\\" is to get the top sales in America (yes, this is sarcasm, people).    Anyway, concerning the album's music, I will say this: The ONLY album I've ever known which has ALL good songs. Even Mike's other albums did not top this, unfortunately (for him and for fans). This album is so good that it completely overshadowed his future albums. His future records had to live in the shadow of this incredible album.    Concerning individual songs:  1. Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' - Great track, espcially the neat ending 10/10  2. Baby Be Mine - A soft track that is pretty good 8/10  3. The Girl Is Mine - Another soft track with Paul McCarthy that is really good 9/10  4. Thriller - It would be a sad, sad thing if you did not know this track 10/10  5. Beat It - The music is good, the lyrics are addictive, and the video is not bad 10/10  6. Billie Jean - Many considers this to be the best dance song of all time and for good reasons 10/10  7. Human Nature - A highly addictive soft track 10/10  8. P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing) - A half soft/fast track that sticks in your head 8/10  9. The Lady In My Life - Another soft song, but somewhat better than the others, in my opinion 9/10    Jesus Christ, can you believe that?A whole album where the lowest grade a song gets is an 8! That is simply incredible, especially for me. Nowadays, I consider an album a good buy if it has 4 good songs, but this album has 9 good songs!    There's a number of people out there who don't listen to Michael Jackson because they say he's a child molester. I personally ask some of these anti-MJ people if they like R. Kelly and they told me yes. I'll leave you guys to judge for yourself.    Anyway, whether you're an MJ fan or not, you simply can not doubt the quality of this album. All fans of music should own this album! For me, I give it every recommendation in my book. Once again, I reiterate, BEST ALBUM EVER!
B0002OERI0|4.0|Ultimately, I believe this has the potential to be a great CD. For the moment, my rating stands as four stars, simply because I haven't yet purchased the CD, and can only judge by the songs I've heard on the radio, and the other reviews I've read. <br /> <br />I am, or at least was, hesitant to even ponder buying the album. American Idiot (the song), even though it has been defended by the band, seems rather offensive to me, and I can take crap pretty well. This is probably the only time someone will hear me seriously say \\"I feel offended.\\" The band passed the song off as an insult to the media, not to the American people in general. But, as much as that may be true judging by the lyrics (personally, I can't actually understand all the lyrics as the song plays), I still get a hint of criticism towards Americans. And I, for one, am damn proud to be an American. I love this country, and would most certainly fight to the death for it. <br /> <br />But, even I can't deny that the song is catchy. I sometimes catch myself, and chide myself for singing along to it. Maybe that's just because the radio drills me with it over and over and over. Possibly ignoring that particular track, though, there is one other radio-played tune from the album that truly made me want to purchase the CD: Boulevard of Broken Dreams. <br /> <br />Throughout these other reviews, I have heard some bad things about that song, just on the basis of it sounding like a cheap knock-off, or how it is so unlike the band, or any other of various things. But, my opinion sits strongly that this song is excellent. I suppose a person has to be able to relate to music to like it. It seems that's the way things go. If you truly consider the song though, deeply listen to it, and allow yourself to comprehend what the song is about, you'll find it as a damn fine track as well. <br /> <br />I generally consider myself to be anti-punk. I've never liked it, at least the majority of it. But, today, it's friggin' hard to tell the difference between punk and... whatever other kind of rock there is. The \\"punk\\" genre has just never appealed to me. I have some friends who are really into it, and I can't stand it. But, bands like Green Day, The Offspring, and Blink 182 (no matter how much the \\"punks\\" deny Blink's status as a fitting band to that world, they are) are pretty good. They've got some good tunes. I've also been introduced to Coheed and Cambria (I think that's the right spelling), and because of how some of their songs relate to me, and how some of them are also rather catchy, I consider them a good band. Sure, there are others. <br /> <br />What I'm getting at, though, is that no matter what style rock you like, Green Day is a good band. May they be maturing as their careers progress, so be it. I think it's for the best. And all the hardcore punks can kiss my ass on that. Someday you'll grow up.
140004281X|3.0|I read this collection feeling as if I was missing something, and perhaps I was.  I enjoyed the stories well enough, but they really didn't seem to be as finely wrought and resonant as some of Ms. Munro's ardent defenders claim.  Still, I read on, and that's saying a lot.  I think the one reviewer who compared Munro to Flannery O'Connor may have unwittingly nailed it, for me.  O'Connor is sort of the ne plus ultra of short-story writing provincial women obsessed with certain scenarios, characters, and images, and I've been going back to dip into her complete stories again and again for years.  Munro's pretty good, but she's no O'Connor.
B000002H33|1.0|Why is this album highly praised? Was it becuase the movie OLD SCHOOL had it in the background? maybe so.Metallica sucks.  The only decent albums they have are load and reload and their masterpiece ST anger. Their first 5 albums are really bad.
B00005JMYI|3.0|I enjoyed Anchorman more because I am a huge Will Ferrell fan rather than because the movie was good...The movie suits Will great, because there are many chances to improvise and make it funny. It sort of reminded me of an SNL skit gone wrong, but still semi-funny just because of will. However, where the movie lacks in the comedy category it really represents the 70's accurately with the whole \\"men rule the world\\" type deal. It sort of shows how women anchors came to be, and it was a small step in woman having more of a say in things. With that said, i would recommend this movie for Will Ferrell fans, but do not expect to be laughing at every single scene.
B000002572|2.0|this cd is anoying, thats all there is to say. More then a feeling is the a boring song, and MNB, it doesnt sound anything like smells like teen spirit, either you were on drugs when you posted that, or you just hate nirvana so much that now your making stuff up about them. If your not a huge fan, do not buy.
0312263120|4.0|This is the third book of Dan Brown I read. I was very impressed by \\"Angels & Demons\\" and totally deceived by \\"Deception Point,\\" and what will be the next? What unfolded before my eyes was \\"unbreakable code!\\" I was really dumbfounded. The story never stopped at that level, and went further to the hyper-super code-breaking computer of the unimaginable scale with the virus!<br /><br />With these setting, the secret of unbreakable code was lost somewhere in Spain. The secret which was embedded in a ring was hard to find because it was soon lost among many people's fingers.<br /><br />Another amusing thing was Dan Brown's research result(?) of human stereotypes that were a little bit sarcastic but fun. Please enjoy the world of Dan Brown!
0345457684|5.0|While it's certainly a bit violent, I never felt that the violence was gratuitous.  This is a book I can honestly feel good recommending, even though it's edgy and perhaps a little bit more than risque.
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|Nice compilation of her work.  Most are recent recordings from her last two albums.
B00005Q4CS|2.0|This film is a really good example of critics assuming that just because a film is graphic and raw, that automatically makes it good. Although is suppose this film has a meaningful overall theme of the dangers of drugs, the bulk of the film is too packed with pointless twiddling to make it valuable. <br /> <br />For one the \\"artistic film techniques\\" are not at all original or compelling. The sped up sequences strike me as a bit too much like Clockwork Orange, although Kubrick had the intelligence to limit these; they keep popping up in Requiem. Much of the other tricks; hand-held or cart-mounted camera when Leto and Wayans take the TV to the flea market, the extreme flickering of lights as the mother slowly goes insane, the psycadelic representations of shooting up (pupils enlarging, sounds of sighs, etc), two different shots split into different parts of the screen, following two distinct actions; I've seen all of this before. <br /> <br />Worst of all it all this foolishness gets in the way of the characters. Perhaps the worst aspect of Requiem is its extreme predictability. Literally 30 minutes into the film I began correctly predicting what would happen in the end. Since we are bombarded with such film-school foolishness early on, we are left with little time to get to know the characters.  <br /> <br />We get glimpses, the mother missing the deceased father, Leto's slight guilt over being an addict, the love between him and Connely, but it isn't as explored as it should have been. As the movie drags on and everyone's life worsens, we don't really know enough about the characters to identify them or care about what happens. The worst example is of Wayans' character, whose back-story (only of 30 second clip relating to his mother) seems to be tacked on as an afterthought so we might care when he is abused in prison at the end. <br /> <br />The only bright spot is that of the mother. Ellen Burstyn is far and away the best actor in the film, which is to say, the only decent one. Her story, though un-realistic (no one ever gets so addicted to diet pills that they hallucinate and have to get electro-shock, sorry. And while we're at it, I'd say that if a prisoner with an infected arm really were made to work until it had to be sawed off, I would say there'd be a pretty big scandal. For that matter, I don't really think that a prison guard would really punch a prisoner in the chest and shout racial slurs at him. All of this is ridiculously dramatized) is somewhat compelling, namely her relationship with the rest of the women in the building; how being on TV makes her \\"somebody.\\" It would perhaps have been a good idea to center the plot on her, but what we're left with is a depressing poorly conceived mess of cookie-cutter film tricks and half-baked characters in a downward spiral. <br /> <br />Thumbs down.
B0006399FS|5.0|This is U2's best complete album since Achtung Baby.  It is a must have!
B000286S8S|5.0|This is a good album to get if you are a new fan of the band.  Start from this one and buy the rest after. Having said that, the studio versions of Panama and Jump along with the live versions with Sammy singing the lead is genius because it gives us, (who haven't had the opportunity to see the band live)a chance to hear the David Lee Roth-era songs done brilliantly by Hagar.  He really has an amazing range in his voice and can sound true to the originals.  Great choice by Eddie to get Sammy in the band. For those of you who just will not accept Sammy Hagar, I ask this question:  What is the name of the band?  Lee Roth? No.  It's Van Halen.  Get over it.  Sammy is so much of a better singer and this album proves it.
B00004RIVF|4.0|I like this band.  If metal were a family, this would be Fates Warning's troublesome little brother.  They are more close to thrash than heavy metal and I think have a really good sound.  I'm sure some would disagree with the comparison to Fates Warning, but I really think they are similar.
B000003S5H|2.0|Maybe I should have read a few more reviews.  This is what I think music will sound like in 2010.  2 robots on computers playing pleasant music, but no real heart or emotion.  They claim to play bass and guitar but it still sounds synthetic to me.  I didn't notice if there was a real drummer, and often it doesn't matter especially for this kind of music, but the whole thing lacks something. It's not bad music, it's perfectly fine to listen to, but wouldn't you rather spend your money on something that is really great, like Theivery Corporation or Zero 7?  I'd pass.
B000002GYI|4.0|This is my second favourite Kraftwerk album, only slightly marred by the faddish subject matter. The electronics are thrilling and  the beats infectious. This can be seen as Kraftwerk's first \\"dance\\" album ( sure, the Man Machine had a few dance-ish beats, but they  weren't this good )Every track here is a winner. I especially like \\"Numbers\\" and \\"It's More Fun to Compute.\\" Highly recommended for fans of early eighties experimental  synth pop .
B0002OERI0|5.0|this is a great album I must say. Like every other reviewer said, it's a lot more mature then their past albums, is that good or bad? you be the judge, but I personally think it's great. Whatever you do, DO NOT pay attention 2 that 13 year old kids review on this album, his breakdown of the tracks are completely outta whack. no offense kid, but the fact you didnt mention Dookie in the greatest albums by Green Day is blasphompous. sorry i just had 2 say somethin'.
B000002O5L|5.0|What can I say?  Tom found Jeff Lynne and the result was a masterpiece.  Perhaps it was just breaking away from the familiarity of the Heartbreakers that inspired a flood of creativity.  Whatever.  Just listen to the simplicity of songs like \\"Free Falling\\" \\"I won't back down\\" and \\"Running down a dream.\\"  Every tune flows effortlessly into the next and Tom's humor keeps the whole album from becoming too serious.  The true test of greatness?  It still sounds as fresh today as it did in the 80s.
B00006CXSS|5.0|To the previous reviewer:  \\"NUTS!\\"   <br /> <br /> This was a Spielberg/Hanks/Ambrose/HBO collaboration.  It has nothing to do with Amazon.  Not only is B.O.B. the best WWII miniseries I have ever seen, it is also considered \\"reference\\" quality picture and sound for the DVD format.  90 bucks is expensive, but I promise you, you will not find a better DVD set made period.  They have just one of these left at my local Best Buy, and it just sits locked up in a display case for about 100 bucks.  The Amazon price is excellent. <br />    I had probably watched each episode 3 times each BEFORE even buying the DVD set.  That is how special this miniseries is.  Perfect for 16x9 TVs as well, all episodes in 1.78:1 aspect ratio with DD 5.1.   <br /> <br />  After giving Dreamworks a scathing review reagrding Ghost in the Shell 2 DVD, I thought I would commend them on this wonderful DVD release.  Way to go HBO and Dreamworks!   <br />
B00064MW6A|1.0|If you ask me, i never liked the idea of Catwoman in general because of its cheeze factor. Catwoman is just a plain average looking woman in a dominatrix outfit and a whip that has no superpowers whatswhoever, all she does is rely on her whip to kick butt, climbs on walls, meows, and coughs up hairballs. Nothing about the character in general has enough bulk to put a plot around her, yet alone enough personality to actually feel the character. The only thing Catwoman is good for is as a pin up girl for bondage lovers everywhere. Why Halle Barry decided to play a role that's so dry, boring, and lacks character development, plot, and pretty much everything that made Spiderman and even Wonderwoman great models of superheroism, who knows? The only thing that was hyped up about in this movie was the catsuit. Sure, it's hot and it's cute, but there should be more to a movie than just a catsuit.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|Edit:  I found the \\"V4\\" version today (2/22/05) at Fry's.  Best Buy still did not have the new fixed \\"V4\\" copies.  I am impressed that Dreamworks was fairly quick to fix the closed captioning defect.  Even if you have the first issue with the closed captioning defect, Dreamworks will replace the disc for free if you go to their website.  The \\"V4\\" is only located on the top spine where the white sticker is.          I was very excited about this release.  After reading a few pages of negative reviews, I must say thanks you, both to the countless reviewers and also to Amazon for allowing us to discuss these expensive DVD releases.      It is clear that the ball was dropped on this one.  Studios like Dreamworks better start realizing that customers are savy and we demand quality products for our hard earned money.  Dreamworks will survive financially, their reputation is severely damaged though, as it's clear that little money or effort was put into this DVD, yet they expect us to buy this stuff.  No thanks.  Recall this crap now Dreamworks, and sell the rights to Manga already.  I doubt even one of the Dreamworks board members has seen this film or DVD.       You must provide both English and orginal language tracks on these types of DVDs.  Take a cue from Akira, Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke etc...
0440539811|5.0|When I read this book, I couldn't put it down ,and it was a lot of laughs. Opened me up to  a number of interesting mysteries such as Rennes le Chateau and the Priory, masons, and Theosophy (Blavatsky, Bailey,Creme). Although it seems to me that the Priory list of initiates was a modern hoax perpretrated by a french right wing loon and the rennes mystery was created by a local restaurant owner to pull in more tourists, I still had a riot reading this book. I don't think there is much evidence showing that the masons or rosicrucians existed in Egyptian culture and even less during the fabled Atlantis. <br />The book's ending has the same zooming out affect as in the ending of one of my favourite movies, \\"The Holy Mountain\\" by Alexandro Jodorowsky. <br />I recommend \\"Imaginary Landscape\\" by Terrence McKenna, a book which uses some higher math to graph the permutations of the I-Ching and aligns them with novelty events in history which then shows an apex or Eschaton on Dec. 21, 2012 just like the end of the Mayan Calender.It also theorizes about the possible mechanism of DMT (the active psychotropic chemical in Ayahuasca) and how it may act in brain neurons at the quantum level. DMT is produced naturally in the pineal gland so its like getting high on yourself. <br />I also recommend Benjamin Creme's books which talk about the coming out of the head of the secret chiefs or ascended masters  talked about in theosophy books,namingly Maitreya the World Teacher and his imminent coming out with the rest of the ascended masters, \\"the externalization of the heirarchy\\". <br />This book has inspired me to set out on a mission to infiltrate the Shrine Circus and picket outside my local masonic lodge. <br />Fight the Numshub of Enki and the Shem of the jealous demiurge Ialdaboath!Master Jesus, please keep the Absolutists at bay! <br /> Thank you Mr. Wilson!
B0002S94OS|5.0|I have to say that even though this is the first Lamb of God album I have bought, and I haven't been a fan for that long that this band kicks MAJOR ass. This album is a technical masterpiece. The riffing is so tight and the production is incredible. It makes you want to bang your head through a wall. Some people may not enjoy the vocals, which I admit are horrible upon first listen, pretty lame attempt at a death growl, but they grow on you and fit the music. Their riffs remind me so much of old Slayer, so dark and evil sounding. This album is effortlessly catchy, I cannot stop listening to it, even non-metal fans could enjoy this based on the sheer musicianship alone. One gripe I have is the lack of solos, but as we've seen over the past 5 years of metal, solos aren't necessary to have an amazing album. So buy up, whatcha waiting for???? A must have for fans of 80's Slayer and Sepultura!
B000002N2P|4.0|This is my second Green Day album (American Idiot being the first) and i really do enjoy it.  Especially songs like Geek Stink Breath and Brain Stew/Jaded.  However, this album is just different in a way i can't explain how and it is rather short.  i guess that just goes to show how much the band has changed and matured.  Still a good album.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|If memory serves me right, I first saw this film in a theater back in May 1992. Although it was great I didn't officially get the video until this very DVD issue in 2004. I was ashamed of myself for not getting the original video release right away back in 1992.    The film itself is an unusual one for the average fairy tale. Typically, when one hears a fairy tale like 'Snow White,' 'Cinderella,' 'Sleeping Beauty,' or 'The Little Mermaid,' all of which the Walt Disney Company turned into splendid animated blockbuster hits, he/she can expect a type of 'love-at-first-sight' consequence; they see and like each other immediately. But in this one, the meeting is so much different: Belle, the leading character, doesn't know who she'll be in love with. She just wants 'adventure in the great wide somewhere' and not to be married to Gaston, the so-called 'Don Juan' of her French village whom everyone favors over Belle. But is Belle interested in him? I don't think so! Gaston is wicked on the inside, but he'll stop at nothing to get Belle for his wife.    But when Belle searches for her father, she does escape Gaston's clutches but at the same time becomes the Beast's prisoner. And at first she is afraid of the Beast, who had been a self-centered Prince once before. Eventually they get to know and love each other because the Beast wants to be 'Human Again' and have a kind heart, and Belle, with her outer and inner beauty, is the one who gives this kind of love to him and his servants. And in the end, a spiritual transformation seems to take place much similar to that in 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.'    It should be noted that an old peddler woman turned the bratty Prince into a Beast and his servants into objects who haven't been used for ten years because he didn't take the hag's 'inner beauty' seriously. THIS is the most important part of the whole film: 'True beauty comes from within.' That's so true: you don't hear that in a lot of films or even WITNESS it.    You'lllove this new version's bonuses. Not only is the song 'Human Again,' which was used in the Broadway production of B&TB, worth noting for its cheerful melody and fabulous PIXAR-type design (it was thrown in as 'an all-new musical sequence'), but there is so much to enjoy that I can't explain it in full.    My only complaint is that the Walt Disney Company seems to have this ridiculous policy of 'release something on video/DVD and then throw it into the vault after three months.' That was where this release went: into the vault. Hard to believe such a wonderful studio could do such a 'limited edition' thing to its beloved hits. They're only released once every few years. To people who'd like to see the films, they either have to search long and hard for or wait to see these films on TV, if ever at all. Later.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've only recently gotten into pop/punk and i can't believe what i've been missing all this time!  This is my first of three Green Day albums (I have two others, Insomniac and Nimrod), and its definiately the best of them.  I can't exactly explain why.  It just sounds better, the songs are better, what can I say.  Not that their other albums aren't bad.  They're totally awesome.  Needless to say, this is a must-have for any Green Day fan.
B00008J4P5|2.0|this album is trash, they rip off other bands such as The Cure, John Lennon. this guy Jack (if that is his real name) sounds like a bad version (...). And the drums suck, like really. Walt Mink had a chick drummer and she could show me up, but this (...), which is fitting with the music. I dislike this album a lot, If You're Looking For Indie Rock don't turn to MTV.<br />(...)
0689862725|3.0|Pure escapism not at the top of his list of a decent read.
B00008ADPF|5.0|---About the band--- <br />What I love about this band is that they do one thing, and they do it well.  They rock.  No booze, no piercings or tattoos up the wazoo, no mental issues or prima donna attitudes... they simply pump out what they came to do ... rock the music world. <br /> <br />Also a bonus, them EVER breaking up is slim to none, mainly since two of the guys are brothers (like Oasis), and they don't have the BS issues that other bands have (as noted above) <br /> <br />---About the Album--- <br />This album is so wonderful to listen to.  I can play it over and over and not get tired of it.  Best song has got to be \\"Believe it or Not.\\"  I love the beat to it, and how the sound goes from jagged, to smooth, then hard and loud, and it shows Chad's vocal flexibility.  It's a truly wonderful experience to hear this album. <br /> <br />Though it's 10 minutes longer than their previous album, there's not a single bad song on it.  The last album's good songs (hits) were massive hits.  The Long Road balances it out and leaves you satisfied, as it also raises the bar.  <br /> <br />Like Lasagna with good aftertaste, and a glass of chardonay, you get your money's worth with this album. <br /> <br />4.75 out of 5
B0000X61VE|3.0|OK, I have mixed feelings about this workout...like ALL of Cindy Crawfords workouts (The Next Challange, and New Dimension). I have all of them because I think that the workouts are well designed...BUT you have to know something about fitness to do these moves correctly and for the best results. Cindy consistantly does the exercises incorrectly. If you follow her, you may end up injuring yourself. She has had RADU and Kathy Kaehler, both fitness experts, but apparently they did not teach her the value of lifting weights correctly. Cindy also consistantly makes little comments that just annoy me. So, I think that if YOU take it upon yourself to do the moves correctly, this is a great quick supplemental workout, but if you are not sure how to lift weights and are just starting a workout routine, I would try another video first. I do these videos when I don't have time to get to the gym, and I know they have changed my body, but I basically turn it on and do the workout in the way that is best for me. Thanks for reading!
0380789035|5.0|I loved this book.  I read so many books that end up being so similar to each other in one way or another. This book just shattered that problem and did so within two pages.  I have not had the pleasure of reading any of Mr. Gaiman's other books, so this was a first for me.  A wonderful first. I will be purchasing all of his books in short order.  Although, I may just sit back and read this one again, just to enjoy the ride one more time.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|When I explained the premise of the movie, no one could believe it was actually a love story. Perhaps US audience will find it taboo to think of such - a young girl who falls for an older man. I am not saying it's right, but its what the movie is about and people viewing these kinds of movies should always keep an open mind to appreciate the story.<br /><br />- The fact that you are checking out the Deluxe Edition of this movie proves that you already know what it is all about - an Italian cleaner whose methodic life is disrupted by a next-door neighbor, a young girl. It is because of her that he learned to appreciate life and realized what love is once more.<br /><br />- This is a two disc set. It is mastered using Sony's Superbit - optimized video encoded at double the normal rate. Couple this with DTS and Dolby Digital and you have one heck of an experience in picture quallity.<br /><br />- The first disc contains the actual original \\"Leon\\" movie. This has been previously released and mastered in Superbit. Apart from that, the only extra feature found here is the \\"Fact Track\\". This is activated and replaces the Subtitle. In place are lots of facts that appear throughout the movie regarding the movie, the production experience, the casts and even miscellaneous facts about them that isn't connected to the movie anymore. Hmm. Because of the Superbit mastering, the size of the first disc alone is around 6.84GB.<br /><br />- The goodies are really found on disc 2. A mere 2.58GB, but lots of facts and interviews of almost all the main people responsible for creating the movie - the producer, director, cinematographer, editor, costume designer, casts and even the casting director. Interesting facsts as to how Natalie Portman got the part by showing her audition tape.<br /><br />- Particularly of worthy note are the few peeks on the behind the scenes on how important scenes were done - Leon slipping in and out of the darkness; the rocket launcher setup used to blow up the apartment.<br /><br />- There is a segment each for Jean Reno and Natalie Portman on their life prior to and after this movie. This should be pleased both fans.<br /><br />- All in all a great buy and worthy investment especially since this could be had for less than USD18.72 over at Amazon. If you compare this with other DVD versions of this movie, they are being sold for more than USD20.00 and they carry the same uncut version, but no features like this.<br /><br />- CONS. Yes, there are. Like every great DVD Deluxe Edition, you wonder why there were stuff left out to enjoy.<br /><br />1. Since they already too the effort to produce a segment called \\"10 Year Retrospective\\", it would have been nice to see them assemble the important cast and crew in one room, too, and just talk and relive the memories.<br /><br />2. Where is the director commentary? He could talk in French, but it is easy to translate this with another subtitle track for the US audience. It would have been fun to learn what was in his head as he takes us through each scene. This is standard for most DVDs already, I'm surprised they didn't take the time out to do that here.<br /><br />3. The DVD has already been mastered in Superbit for its video and the resulting audio tracks in DTS and Dobly Digital. But why not go the last step and have it mastered in THX. A little more thought could have gone a long way for the fans. Perhaps it is reserved for the agine film negative for a \\"20 Year Retrospective\\"? Save the film while it is still intact!<br /><br />4. They talk about Eric Serra, the music composer for all Luc Besson directed films. (Danny The Dog/Unleashed doesn't count because it isn't directed by Besson) as part of the Fact Track. But they fail to mention the fact in the powerful ending of the film where Mathilda plants the, umm, plant. We all know that it is Sting's \\"Shape of My Heart\\", but what we SHOULD know is that this is obviously another version and can only be found in the guitarist's(Dominc Miller) album - Shapes. A version worthy of obtaining. A fact worthy of mentioning.<br /><br />- As I said, an excellent purchase. I can't wait for them to produce a Deluxe Version for Big Blue. And can't begin to think how this will look like when produced in the DVD High Definition format.<br /><br />Until the next special edition comes out, this is something to cherish and enjoy.e found in the guitarist's (Dominc Miller) album - Shapes.

0553260111|5.0|The plot is exciting, and has many unexpected turns.  Jason Bourne is just a great character, and you haven't a clue what he really is until 3/4 of the way through the book.  And nothing is really obvious, which is why I like to read novels; books that are predictable are boring.  This is not a boring book; it's fast-paced all the way through, and the character development is very good, even on the less significant characters. <br />And the way Ludlum puts you right into the culture and scenery is what makes the plot so suspenseful.  A great read. <br />I've read the 2 sequels.  I can't decide which is better: Identity or Supremacy.  But Ultimatum was a serious letdown.
B0002TSZK6|4.0|I just finished watching this film and I have to say that it raises substantial questions about George W. Bush. I'm aware that no one will ever know the whole truth but there are things that can't be ignored ie. \\" did he really use 9/11 as an excuse to invade Iraq \\"? (since he never had a problem with them when they were on good terms). Because all the Iraqi oil is going into his hands, IMHO greed and self-gain certainly do play a role.     IMO a leader of any country is elected to:     1. Protect and defend his Country     2. Better the Country and the lives of his people     3. Be a good role model to his people    Yes, I think being a leader is a hard job but I also think that if someone is going to run for this position then they should truly want to do it for those reasons. It always surprises me that a majority of people who end up as leaders have led such priviledged lives. How can they know what the general population needs? I wish that someday someone honest, noble and inspiring will lead my Country. I guess there is a reason why people say \\"there are no honest politicians\\". Here, I read about corrupt government officials stealing tax dollars all the time.....*sigh* maybe that's because the majority who get to the top are scumbags ~ But I won't give up hope because I always believe that when it comes to good vs. evil, good ALWAYS wins.

0385510454|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It is well written and it kept me interested until the very end. I don't mind Grisham's break from a legal novel and this book has no sex or graphic violence to detract from a well-devised plot. It's not a book bound for the status of his earlier works, lacks the gripping nature of those. My only true complaint is that the ending is a bit abrupt and I was left wanting more depth. I'd recommend it to Grisham and non-Grisham fans.
B0006284JQ|5.0|This album is filled with thumpin pop and tribal/hiphop/club-influenced beats and rhythms that will surely fire-up those lame cold winter days. It Starts with the best coversong and 2004's best Pop and top20's hitsongs then calms with a ballad and revamps with her No.1 Single and an Online Hit!

0385510454|2.0|After reading the first 75, or so pages, I thought to myself <br />Grisham is back. What followed was a lesson in Italian, <br />a travelouge of two Italian cities, and how to order in an <br />Italian cafe. In movies, they call it \\"chewing up the scenery. <br />The last 40 pages were written in a hurry to end the tale. <br />No exceptional page turning during the novel. If I were to <br />compare this book to \\"The Firm\\", I'd only give it a half star.
B000000OAL|5.0|It is far too easy when discussing QUEEN's first LP, to throw tons of adjectives around describing the album's brilliance. I was quite stunned the first time I heard this album. As a rabid metal fan, I was skeptical about Queen. I considered them pompous, glammy, and too commercial. That was BEFORE I listened to the first three Queen albums(Queen, Queen II, and Sheer Heart Attack). It is unfortunate that there are only two or three songs off the first three LP's that really get any steady airplay. I think it is for this reason that many metal heads are unaware of how awesome early Queen was, and particularily, how rad Queen's debut was. Brian May's guitar work on \\"Queen\\" (1973) is arguably the most exciting post-Hendrix guitar work of the 70's. May's guitar is layered and blended, infusing classical, jazz, funk, and beautiful acoustic passages, over molten metal fretwork. It is easy to hear May's influence on Tipton and Downing(Judas Priest), Roth(Scorpions),  Schenker(UFO), and Y. Malmsteen. Mercury's vocals are equally dynamic and always enthralling, as he weaves complex tales as well as pure rock lyrics. There isn't one weak moment on Queen's debut, thus making it essential for all rock fans. One could spend decades listening to this debut. It offers infinite enjoyment. So if you are a rock fan, take a chance and buy this album. If you are a metal head but do not yet own Queen's debut, get it quick, as you are missing out on probably the SINGLE MOST INFLUENTIAL METAL ALBUM OF ALL TIME, rivaled only by the innovations of early Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Uriah Heep, and Led Zeppelin!!! So roll a joint, sit back, crank it up, and enjoy some 'modern times rock 'n' roll' !!!!
B0000DCGT1|4.0|This movie has a very slow start for the first one hour, but you want to stay with it as it has a superb finish. It is the story of four unlikely heros who during the 1920s and 1930s defied the odds to rise to the top of horse racing. The horse owner, the horse trainer, the jockey and Seabiscuit present a heartwarming true story, against long odds but filled with courage, loyalty and great effort, as they achieve greatness.
B00000DR5I|5.0|\\"Rubycon\\" is TD's 5th album release,coming right off the huge international success of their previous release,the now-classic,\\"Phaedra\\".In many ways,\\"Rubycon\\" is similar to \\"Phaedra\\",both in style and in the use of instruments,such as mellotron,etc.,but there are also many differences as well,with one of the most obvious being the lesser amount of only two tracks instead of the usual four,but even with the fewer tracks,\\"Rubycon\\" is still able to dazzle you with its lush mellotron soundscapes and stimulating musical directions.The first piece,the appropriately titled \\"Rubycon\\",can be considered the light side of the album,with its gently pulsating mellotron in the background and the other synths taking you away,sucking you into a whole other dimension of sound that you will never want to leave from.The beauty of this early ambient piece surrounds and consumes you,leaving you in a natural,music-induced high.Once again,I find that words cannot fully describe the emotions that I feel while listening to this electronic soundscape of no return.Simply breathtaking.This brings me to the final piece,\\"Rubycon Part 2\\",which is the dark side of the album.From the very first seconds of listening to this piece,you will instantly know that this track will be different than the first.The first few minutes consist of what I believe to be some of TD's most darkest sounds ever in their entire history,with electronically generated chorus-sounding male voices that remind me of some gothic horror film,truly an eerie few moments of dark ambient bliss.Eventually,the artificial chorus gives way to some equally eerie sounding synths,continuing in this pattern for a good portion of the rest of the track.Simply astonishing,considering this was recorded in 1975!The final few minutes of the piece sees the eerie atmosphere slowly dissipating,and for the rest of the piece,the darkness gradually fades and the sun starts to peak out of the black clouds for the first time since the beginning of the album,with the piece ending with a beautiful,brighter melody of calm,and then,sadly,the album comes to a close,leaving you with the mindset that it could have gone on for all eternity and you wouldn't have minded.This album's theme is most accurately described as a journey to the darkest corners of the universe and back.A powerful early ambient masterpiece by Tangerine Dream.Very Highly Recommended!lbum,with the piece ending with a beautiful,brighter melody of calm,and then,sadly,the album comes to a close,leaving you with the mindset that it could have gone on for all eternity and you wouldn't have minded.This album's theme is most accurately described as a journey to the darkest corners of the universe and back.A powerful early ambient masterpiece by Tangerine Dream.Very Highly Recommended!
B0006GVJEE|5.0|Sometimes I think to myself, how did this movie not receive immediate critical acclaim and box office success upon its release in 1994?  But then I remember how it was marketed.  It was marketed as a hip, fast-paced, hitman action movie.  But in reality it is a poetic, moving, elegant drama that happens to include a few great action scenes.  Sometimes I wonder how Gary Oldman didn't receive a Best Supporting Actor nod for his work in this film.  But then I remember that the Academy seldom gives such honors to over-the-top villains, no matter how well they are played.  I don't know how many times I've watched and rewound the moment where Oldman's character swallows a mysterious pill in the hallway (the \\"calm before the storm\\") and subsequently how he reacts to the drug.  Amazing.  You know what, there are too many good things to say about this film.  Basically, every performance is perfect, every character is cast perfectly, the music is perfect, the direction and cinematography are perfect.  It is truly a flourishing work of art; a master stroke from director Luc Besson.  Time will attest to that.
B00005JMCN|5.0|Hope rose from the ashes of dreams broken in the Great Depression in the form of Seabiscuit, the little horse that could. This story of an owner and down-and-out trainer and jockey who made the impossible possible and defeated even a Triple Crown winner is all the more heartwarming because it's true. Tobey Maguire shows just how underrated he is as an actor as legendary jockey Red, and casting real champion Gary Stevens as George Wolfe adds realism to racing scenes perfectly choreographed and coordinated by Chris McCarron. Although there's some cursing, drinking and a lot of brawling, I still recommend this as a great family film. Enjoy
B000089RVX|5.0|For some reason, people are constantly comparing this band to other bands that honestly sound nothing like them--I'm sorry, but this CD really isn't a Lacuna Coil ripoff. There are similarities--they're both female fronted rock bands--but that's it. Evanescence isn't really \\"metal\\", nor do they have another (male) singer. Evanescence has really been around as long as Lacuna Coil or Nightwish or whatever; just because they're on MTV and have, for some strange reason (maybe because they're good), achieved huge commerical success doesn't mean that they're fake and that they completely ripped off other bands that they sound nothing like. It's a great CD and the style of music is different  from \\"metal\\", so in no way can you compare it to Slayer, Pantera or Iced Earth. Or even After Forever, Nightwish, Lacuna Coil, The Gathering, etc... It's just different.
B000002MFE|5.0|Definitively Eric Clapton is like the good wine . He improves through the years, with his admirable personal style , fresh and innovative . He knew to get off from the rock sound in the late seventies keeping a personal profile and turning carefully to the musical roots of Lee J. Hooker - the God Father blues -, incorporating impressive lyrics , following the traces of his spiritual guide : Bob Dylan. The presence of giant musicians such Steve Winwood and John Mayall , to name just two of them has allowed to experience and enriching the visions one each another , between the new country sounds with good taste and easy to sing themes .<br /><br />Since his immortal presence as solist guitar in Cream in those far sixties to the actual times Clapton has walked a long and winding road .<br /><br />Tears in heaven is undoubtedly his no time legacy ; shows the divine muse the unconscious call from this rapture artistic loaded of sad inspiration : I mean poetry in its most intimate feature .<br /><br />A soft voice not necessarily potent has allowed to conquer five generations of listeners . From the Yard birds , to the present Eric Clapton may be well considered the last English bard of the music .<br /><br />His message not only concerns with the urban issues , he as a real poet, searches beneath the epidermis of the things and due his undeniable charisma has become in an authentic icon , a living legend.<br /><br />Furthermore , the fact this album has been released twelve years ago and it has not aged just a little bit confirms the thesis the genius is always contemporanean.

B000056TKC|5.0|I cannot but wholeheartedly share my colleagues' enthusiasm for this recording. I grew up with it (and, in fact still own the original 2-LP red album shown in this CD's cover, numbered by DGG -yes, back then they had an extra \\"D\\" in their name- as 138002/3 SLPM, one of their very first essays in the then novel stereophonic technology) and it still remains very close to me. Besides the 9th Symphony and the Egmont Overture presented in this reissue, the original release included an excellent rendition of the Leonora Overture No. 3, left out now (I suppose) so that a second CD would not be needed. The CD's higher transfer volume helps in bringing the sound closer to the listener (DGG apparently having decided to play it safe  when their engineers cut the LPs' masters in 1958) and conferring to it an immediacy and transparency new to me whilst preserving its beautiful tone. <br /> <br />There's not much I can add to what has been written by others in this site, apart perhaps that by 1957 the Berlin Philharmonic still was very much, staff-wise, what it was under Furtwangler and it shows in this recording's sonority. After all, the grand old man had died scarcely 3 years before these works were put into tape, Karajan had just taken over the orchestra as chief conductor and the lean, muscular and to-the-point sound that became characteristic under his long regime was still two or three years into the future. Karajan took to rotate the orchestra's musicians fairly often, far more often actually than was customary with his predecessors and the results of the first shake-up became apparent when in 1962 the same company presented the first of Karajan's three Beethoven symphony cycles he'd record with them, when the orchestra's new virtuosity surprised critics the world over (Karajan had in his record a prior Beethoven symphony cycle, made for EMI during the fifties with the Philharmonia Orchestra). But what we get here, and in fine early stereophony, is the grand old sonorityof the orchestra, the one that still had links to the pre-war years but which soon enough would evolve into an instrument capable of aweing its audiences under their new and starry conductor on account of its virtuosity and perfection. <br /> <br />But Fricsay's interpretations differ greatly from Furtwangler's. There is a tautness of approach, a more modern focusing on architecture that does not look back in time as much of Furtwngler's work did (but splendidly so, I must add), embedded as it was on german romanticism, but decidedly centres in our own time. Fricsay's approach to the Symphony's 4th movement is as modern as the late fifties allowed to, marking a singular kind-of-extrapolated cue to today's \\"historically aware\\" presentations, and DGG feted him with an outstanding quartet of vocal soloists. Yes, the 3rd movement is slow, perhaps harking back to the grand old man's ways but Fricsay gave us lessons of tempo handling in the first and second movements that have nothing to do with Furtwangler's fluctuations, an approach decidedly his, full of musicianship and with a solid grasp of the beethovenian language. So it is also in the performance of the Egmont Overture which fortunately made its way to the disc. <br /> <br />Yes, cancer robbed us of an immensely talented conductor who probably would have rivalled Karajan (who was but a few years his senior) during much of the second half of the 20th Century. What would have become of Fricsay's career is anybody's guess, as is the case with other conductors (like Cantelli, for example) whose careers were cut short by untimely death, but mind you, if you decide to buy this disc you will end up with one of the finer recordings this warhorse has had ever.
B000002JA8|3.0|Following the critical and commercial success of 1993's \\"Very\\", the Pet Shop Boys set off to create a album Neil Tennnant described as \\"an international album.\\" Inspired by latin and Caribbean percussion the boys heard while on their Discovery tour- the groundwork for \\"bilingual\\" was set. While previous PSb albums were very much set in the rainy-day atmosphere of the UK. this new album introduces us to a happier PSB- caught up in the joys of love.<br /><br />The album itself is a rather imbalanced affair that even Neil and Chris admit is too long an album. The first half of the album follows the latin theme with its thundering drums courtesy of percussion troupe Sheboom. Tracks \\"discoteca\\" and \\"single\\" Neil sings snippets in Spanish asking \\"hay una discoteca por aqui?\\". After the sunny up-tempo \\"Se A vida E (thjats the way life is)\\" the Pets get stuck in their old euro groove and the latter half of the album is pedestrian PSB. The songs are still enjoyable though and most PSB fans will enjoy them. \\"The survivors\\" wouldn't be out of place on 1990's \\"Behaviour\\" with its shuffle rhythm and elegaic themes about AIDS and life while \\"Saturday Night forever\\" is PSB in classic disco mode.<br /><br />Overall \\"Bilingual\\" is a good an album  but may have left some of the PSB fan base disappointed arriving after the full-on dance pop explosion of \\"Very.\\" Personally I enjoyed the album overall but do agree with other reviewers that \\"bilingual\\" was the first of their weaker albums. Coming from the Pet Shop Boys-its still a pretty solid release.<br /><br />Best Moments: \\"Se A Vida E\\", \\"Red Letter Day\\", \\"Up against it\\" Weaker moments: \\"Before\\", \\"Electricity\\"

B00000613T|5.0|The symphonies and song cycles of Gustav Mahler have become a staple of every orchestra's repertoire since the passionate fervor of Leonard Bernstein's gradual release of the entire cycle in the 1960s. Granted great conductors such as Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer et al were generous in leaving behind the legacy of Mahler's particular brand of composing.  But it was Bernstein's crusade that established Mahler as a voice not to be ignored.  Now the recordings of Mahler works gain more attention than most other composers each year as the public appetite for these masterworks proliferates.<br /><br />Almost everyone knows the 1st, 2nd (Resurrection), 3rd, 4th - all laced with musical quotations from his songs and folk music -the devastatingly beautiful Adagio from the 5th, and more and more the 6th as it finds increasing performances.  The 'tough' symphonies such as the 7th, 8th and especially the 9th now are finding at least enough exposure via recordings that they seem the next logical step toward the standard orchestral season.<br /><br />This performance of the demanding, complex, extraordinarily difficult 9th symphony is an exciting examination of the complexities of the work.  Pierre Boulez conducts the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (one could almost stop there: with forces such as these the result is bound for glory!) in a well-engineered CD.  Boulez continues to unravel the puzzles of orchestration that have befuddled many a fine conductor, especially in the first movement and his control over the balance of the orchestral voices is among the finest recorded. The CSO plays its heart out for him in the mighty climaxes and becomes hauntingly close to inaudible in the opening and closing movements.<br /><br />What is missing for this listener is the wry tongue-in-cheek humor of the second movement that balances the symphony's preoccupation with death and dying, and the idiosyncratic weeping passion of Mahler's late years.  Perhaps this is due to the studio ambience and method of playing for retakes.  Having just experienced a wondrous, soulful, yet kaleidoscopically multifaceted Mahler 9th with Michael Tilson Thomas on tour with the San Francisco Symphony in Disney Hall in Los Angeles (one hopes and expects that MTT will release the 9th as the next installment in his own highly regarded Mahler cycle), it IS possible for all the angst and all the survey of Mahler's response to his life's waning to be respected and discovered.<br /><br />Yet for all that, Boulez and the CSO give a dazzlingly fine version, one that opens most of the windows and respects Mahler's scoring to guide the long work to its own end.  For that we should all be grateful.  Perhaps the mind and heart will eventually meet - probably with the MTT recording to come.  Grady Harp, January 2005nce and method of playing for retakes.

0064407667|3.0|I managed to finish this book in one sitting, however I don't feel it reached its true potential. True, I love this book for its originality, but I was disappointed after reading it. Of course, the title \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\" gives away what the plot would be about, I felt that there wasn't enough for me to continue reading the rest of the series. I guess it's safe to say that I don't like reading about a book that has a \\"roller-coaster\\" type plot. At one point the book would be all happy and then the next it would be grim. I got tired of reading about Violet, Clause, and Sunny and their predictable fate that I grew tired of them.
B00005JNEW|4.0|There is a quote on the DVD box from Larry King saying this is the \\"greatest sports movies ever made\\", but I disagree. It's good, but it's not the greatest. I could have done without the camera moving constantly in the beginning of the movie, but it got better as the movie went on and the story got better too. This movie doesn't delve too much into the personal lives of the athletes, but just enough to let you know what kind of person they are. The story is good and the ending surprised me.     All the actors were good and gave top notch performances, and I wish there more scenes with Tim McGraw, but in his acting debut...top notch.    My favorite part of the DVD is that they tell the real story of the Permian Panthers and you got to see the real people the actors are portraying.    It's a very enjoyable movie and I don't regret buying it. And I recommend watching it with the commentary on, you will learn alot and they dramatized very little. The author of the book spent time with the 1988 team and \\"Boobie\\" Miles has a cameo in the movie a couple of times!!!

People saying useful comments like 'They rule', 'they suck', or whatever ..... <br /> <br />NEGATIVE(s): <br />For what it's worth, the album really only has two sounds:  big syncopated guitars and/or power rifs with pretty vocals or pretty ballads-type songs (with decent orchestration and pretty vocals).  Thus, if you have heard the songs Going Under and My Immortal - then you have pretty much have heard the album.  Just add some male backing/rapping vocals and then you get Bring Me To Life.  Friends have told me that everything on the album sounds the same - from my remarks above, such a criticism should then not be surprising.  Don't get me wrong, sometimes they mix it up by mixing the ballads with the big guitars ..... presto ..... a power ballad! <br /> <br />POSITIVE(s): <br />If you like those two songs - then man, this album is for you!  Furthermore, the album manages to simultaneously have a nice dark brooding feel while still managing to have a good rocking energy.  Also, there have been many a prolific album that essentially only had one or two particular sounds - so this album should not be dismissed for that fact alone. <br /> <br />MY TAKE: <br />I like the vocals (really wins me over) and the music sounds fine and has great energy.  My rage against the system, alterna-self wants to say that this is an uninventive, overproduced piece of ....... however, the rifs, beats, and lyrics are so hooky - I get sucked in (hey, the wheel has been around a long time - still is useful).  Also, please take in account that I'm a sucker for good sensual/brooding female vocals (file under Garbage, Curve, Collide, Tori, Jewel, and the gang).   <br /> <br />I'll be picky though - if I could, I'd give the album 3.5 stars.  However, earning a true 5 from me is really hard - so a 3.5 isn't all that bad.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|Having seen this movie in the theatre I was stunned by the artwork and level of detail involved.  The subtitles used in the theatre were the normal subtitles.  The story has a few twists and turns and was very enjoyable.  Then Dreamworks released the DVD with poor artwork, and closed captioning for subtitles.  I have been trying to locate an email address to contact them and express my disappointment with them.  I do not recommend the original version.  Dreamworks has an excange program now because of the level of disappointment with their product.
B00006FDCD|3.0|I actually didn't buy this movie, I rent it, because my sister watched it when she was 8 ys old, and now she's 22 and she's still afraid to the clowns. I watched it, and the night I did it, I was alone in the house, I turned all the lights out, and I closed the door. When I watched it for the first time, It really scared the *!\\"@ out of me, but, the second time...what? Anyway, that night, the NIGHTMARE i was waiting for was a 5second nightmare!<br /><br />When you watch the movie, what the hell is \\"It\\"? Is it a clown, is it a light, it is a wolf, what? I know that \\"It\\" takes the shape of your most horrible fear, but...a light? \\"The light of dead\\"? and that spider that appears in the end? I know it was advanced technology for that year, but now, let's dress a cable like a spider and there it is!.<br /><br />I won't deny that the first time I watched it, I was really scared, but with some parts only...You really are not waiting for me to scare with the light, are you? It is a good movie to watch once, but twice, don't waste time!
B00000JCOV|4.0|I like this album.  No, that dosen't mean I need a lecture on what good music is or a list of death and black metal bands that are heavier or darker.  Chances are whatever you could recommend is probably already sitting next to this Slipknot album in my cd case right now.  I'm not here to say Slipknot is the greatest, heaviest band in the world or anything like that, but I do think this album is far better than people give it credit for.   <br /> <br />With this release Slipknot manage to blend elements of Thrash and Industrial into the typically stoic nu-metal style to make what is, in my estimation, a pretty good album.  The riffs are heavy and aggressive, not the most technical playing you'll ever hear but it fits the overall sound well.  Joey Jordinson is probably the highlight of this band, his skill level is top tier.  There are quite a few better drummers than him but he does have substantial talent.  Corey Taylor isn't what I would count as an amazing vocalist, but he has heart and intensity, which he gets by on. This album isn't without it's faults but everyone else has pretty much covered that so I won't go into great detail on the matter.  Turntables, Simple Progressions and a somewhat cheesy theme and appearence are basically the key points of the problems.   <br /> <br />Overall, this is far from the best album in the world but it's not terrible either.  I am of the belief that Black and Death Metal are superior to Slipknot, however Slipknot is a great 1st step into the realm of extreme metal and toward those genres.
B00028HBKM|1.0|Someone called `Jesus' might or might not have existed but - manifestly - he was not the `Son of God' nor did he `die to save us' (meaningless drivel). As such, this movie's core claim of `the Christ' is bogus and spurious.  <br /> <br />This movie illustrates religious belief as humankind's most narcissistic enterprise. It's all about self-worship. No one would love Jesus and this film if Jesus were a 300 pound Sumo covered in boils and pimples. People worship themselves by loving an image of `one of us'.  <br /> <br />'Jesus Christ' is as real as Harry Potter. If you're suckered by this kind of Jebus gibberish, you have an opportunity to self-pleasure your mind. Just keep prattling repetitive fantasy drivel about `He Died to Save us from Our Sins' or `Jesus Christ is Lord' or `Death in Christ is Life' or `The Love of Jesus'. Keep self-stimulating those endorphins and feeding self-righteous blood rushes to the head utilising the inane cultural mechanism created for this purpose: the Bible and `Jesus'.  <br /> <br />Like its Biblical source book, this movie is kitsch and schmaltz, the coarse and the crass - cloaked in imitation profundity.  <br /> <br />As everyone is aware, the Jesus Christ figure is merely a man-made symbol (in story/folk tale form) of fatherly-brotherly altruistic sacrifice and of suffering. This myth is utilised to help feed a mental loop of unfulfilled yearnings, guilt and shame. So this movie is built on self-referring, primitive goat-herder stories, wilfully mistaken for something meaningful.  <br /> <br />The movie's source book of primitive stories depicts fantasy figures called `Jesus' and `God' - invented by humans many centuries ago. It is purely and solely the drives of human culture and the products of neurological phenomena and obsessive thought-loops that produced the Bible. `God' is the product of neurological quirk, fused with ego-driven cultural obsession.  <br /> <br />To believe the movie's source book as the word of `God' is merely wilfully to fail to recognise its solely human sources: emotional, neurological, cognitive, cultural, sociological. Man's habitual self-deception and delusional pursuit generate religious belief and acceptance of the farrago that is The Bible (`This is The Word of Men').  <br /> <br />Babies fixate on the all-powerful, all-providing, all-knowing parent figure. This can become mentally fixed and set. The result is rigid, fixated God-belief in adulthood. This spreads like a virus through society, becoming fused into culture.  <br /> <br />So given both its ancient and contemporary creative sources, it is no surprise that this is a gaudy movie - a blunt instrument - lacking finesse and subtly. It is makes crude appeal to crude emotions and is vulgar in its execution.  <br /> <br />The Bible is bogus, spurious, and a garish concoction: a crude, blunt, vulgar appeal to amorphous concepts and broad-brush emotions and desires. For example: fear of death, the feeling of being lost and needing rescue, the psyche's desire for immortality, hunger for an upwardly directed relationship.  <br /> <br />Longings that merely end up as self-comfort mind-loops.  <br /> <br />If only this movie had been ignored - but it is just too difficult for people to break out of the neurological quirk that is religious belief, embedded and fused into culture as it most surely is. The movie is merely a contemporary manifestation of a relentless tradition of self-deception and delusion - of Bible-swill & God-mush - and desire to spread the mind washing cult-virus that is Christianity.  <br /> <br />Humans wish to make sense of suffering. For some, `the Christ' on the Cross is a culturally potent man-made symbol of altruistic sacrifice and of suffering. Constructs of sin, fallen man etc all illustrate that Christianity is merely a fabricated construct employed by humankind/people to:  <br /> <br />- understand their own suffering  <br />- come to terms with their own suffering  <br />- justifysuffering by the person(s) experiencing it  <br />- justify suffering by the person(s) inflicting it  <br /> <br />If all of humankind were extinguished, so would 'Jesus' and 'God' - since this is their sole locus of existence. Truly it is manifest to all that: on the 7th day, man created God in his own image.  <br /> <br />Chances are that people who dislike this review will promptly generate ever more fierce and tight circles of endorphin producing self-pleasuring belief thought-loops in order to dismiss it. But, equally, dissent from the turgid dogma of religious mind baths is apparently also allowed in the land of `the free'.  <br /> <br />At the foot of the end credits, we are accurately and truthfully informed that:  <br /> <br />\\"CHARACTERS AND EVENTS PORTRAYED IN THIS MOTION PICTURE ARE FICTITIOUS.\\"
0316172324|2.0|It's an interesting topic to ponder: how do we know things in an instant? In fact this topic has been pondered for millennia and studied extensively for the last fifty years. There are wonderful philosophical, religious, and scientific works on this topic. The knowledge and insights available are both broad and deep. This particular book, Blink, The Power of Thinking without Thinking, does not add anything new or insightful.<br /><br />While reading this book I felt as if I were at a business reception and found myself engaged in a one sided conversation with a nice fellow who went on way too long about how the mind works. My mind works. And what my mind told me was find a waiter, get another drink, and excuse myself. Never ending anecdotes, no matter how well intended, embellish a point, but do not prove it or provide a deeper understanding. That's the way Blink is. I cannot recommend it because it sheds no new light on an old subject and there are better works on the mind and cognition.
