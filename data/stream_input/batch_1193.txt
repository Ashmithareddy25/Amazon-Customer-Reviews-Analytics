B00005R8FI|4.0|Despite what Mr. Frank John Hadley of the Grove Press Guide has to say, this is a very good CD. He claims Mayall is basically lost without Clapton or Green. I beg to disagree. On \\"A Hard Road\\" Mayall penned 8 of the 12 songs and played a multitude of instruments as well as handling the vocals. Sure, Clapton and Green made great contributions to the success of the Bluesbreakers (as did several other artists such as Paul Butterfield and Mick Taylor), but let there be no doubt that it was John's band. For more evidence of the talents of Mayall, check out \\"The Blues Alone\\". John plays every instrument on every song as well as the vocals. Six and nine string guitar, bass, piano, organ, harmonica, drums & celeste. Steve Winwood is the only other artist I can think of that was skilled at so many different instruments in addition to being an excellent songwriter and vocalist (well, maybe McCartney). So, Mr. Hadley, you review quite badly. Don't listen to the snobs at Grove Press. This is a great album and worthy of a place on your shelf right next to Mayall's Bluesbreakers discs.

1932100660|5.0|I am a Registered Nurse with a good working knowledge of diseases and nutrition. Even though I knew and did everything the traditional medical community did and was doing 'all the right things', I was unhealthy, overweight, and at extreme high risk for death! The scientific research taking place over several decades in The China Study is well documented with compelling evidence that makes eating a plant based, whole food diet completely logical. This book was a real \\"wake up call\\" for me. My view of food, the entire food industry, and in particular views on my own health have changed forever. I had blinders on, like most people. I thought my health problems were \\"genetic\\" and inevitable, and pretty much expected to get cancer or die of a heart attack and there was little I could do to prevent it, that I was doing all that I could, never imagining that I could take control of my health! I am now empowered with solid knowledge of how to be healthy, to reverse my heart disease and type II Diabetes, to avoid most diseases including cancer, and feel happier and healthier than ever before. All of my life I loved meat and dairy, but the overwhelming evidence presented in this book make me not ever want to put them in my body again. Since I have been vegan, I have lost substantial amount of weight, my doctor has taken me off medication for high blood pressure, Type II Diabetes, migraines, GERD, chronic joint/muscle pain, and high cholesterol. I no longer have Metabolic Syndrome (key indicator for impending heart attack) and am no longer in the \\"high risk\\" group for heart disease, in fact my last cardiac-checkup and my stress-test were so good, the doctor made me repeat the test because he couldn't believe the improvement, and I have never felt better in my life! Since I read The China Study, I have seen the documentary \\"Forks Over Knives\\", which dramatically cemented in my head the animal protein effects on the body. We all know cholesterol is bad for us, right? Did you know that ALL bad cholesterol (LDL) comes from animals? Eat animals = high LDL = heart disease, period!!! And then there's all the garbage pumped into animals raised for food and all of their stress hormones (from inhumane treatment NOT protected by animal cruelty law because they aren't \\"pets\\"!) released into their bodies you take in when you eat them.<br /><br />I was like most people, not thinking about where my food came from, or what it was invisibly doing to my body. I was letting animal agriculture lobbyists dictate to the government what I can and cannot know about the food I was eating, and believing the \\"whitewash\\" propaganda. I was a victim of the country's healthcare system that wants us to be sick, taking expensive medications and getting expensive treatments and surgeries, and I blindly expected my doctor to tell me whatever is best for me; and I was getting sicker each year. I had my first heart attack in 1998 at the age of 39, and immediately began eating exactly as the American Heart Association told me to: no fried foods, only lean cuts of meat, increased fiber, cutting out red meat, no more simple carbs and sweets, eating more fruits and vegetables, and getting regular exercise. I continued to develop plaque in my arteries, and developed angina. In 2009 I had another heart attack, and had a stint placed. I was counseled by a Dietician who felt I was already on a very heart-healthy diet and exercise program and told to 'keep doing what you are doing' and was put on statin meds (along with other prescriptions I was already taking for Diabetes, GERD, hypertension, chronic pain, frequent migraines, and angina) and 2 months later I had another heart attack, and was told by my cardiologist I should \\"get my affairs in order\\", there was nothing more \\"they\\" could do and pretty much gave me a death sentence. So I lived thinking I was dying; until I decided to do something on my own, acquire knowledge, so I began deeply researching and I found this life-changing book. I immediately stopped eating meat, dairy, and eggs (the dairy was hardest to give up, because it has an addictive effect on the body) but I knew I had to do this if I wanted to cheat death!<br /><br />Three months into a diet based entirely on plants with no dairy, eggs, processed food, and little oil, I had lost 35 pounds and my blood sugars were normal, and my GERD was gone and I was able to get off those prescriptions. After 5 months on the diet, I was able to get off my blood pressure medicine and the NSAIDs for chronic pain, and had lost another 20 pounds. I had not had an episode of angina nor have I had a migraine since my starting on a plant-based diet, so I don't need my Nitro or pain meds for migraine anymore. My arterial blockages which were at 70 and 85% are cleared completely. I have effectively reversed my heart disease and type II Diabetes, cured my GERD, migraines, and angina. I am heart attack proof and will not get most types of cancer, all thanks to the research of Drs Esslestyn (Forks Over Knives) and Campbell (The China Study) and being able to commit to a whole foods, plant based diet.<br /><br />I have now been able to eliminate oil from my diet as well. I always enjoyed my food before, and sure, I miss some aspects of the normal, American diet, but I do NOT miss what it was doing to me; it was killing me! I really love all of the colorful and nutritious food I eat nw on a vegan diet, and so does my husband and son, who also eat a strong plant based diet after learning from The China Study and Forks Over Knives. I am 52 years old now, and have the energy and health of a 25 year old. I have so much energy! I can't believe after feeling \\"old\\" tired, and sick every day for 20 plus years, that I am feeling this good and not taking ANY prescriptions! To tell you the truth, I am very worried about our country's new healthcare plan that goes into effect next year, and was pretty sure with my health issues, I would be passed over for care, and probably not be able to get the medicines I was prescribed to keep me alive. Now I do not have that worry, I simply don't have health issues anymore!<br /><br />I hope you will not wait until you are at the point I was to feed your body a truly healthful diet instead of a death diet. Sure, I had nothing else to lose by trying it, but IT WORKED, and anyone who eats a whole food (no processed stuff) plant based diet will become their healthiest self. I am healthy now, and even if you don't have health problems, wouldn't you want only the best for your body? I highly recommend anyone interested in their health or the health of their loved ones, to watch this documentary and share it with those you love.

I have heard and read many styles of Martial Arts but Wing Chun is by far one of the best to practice. Before studying the art of Wing Chun I purchased this book to learn about this great master. His teachings are inspiring and will make you appreciate how wonderful and kind this man was. I enjoy every page of this book and all that was written in it.

B003VR5PPY|5.0|I'm a big fan of mystery and adventure games like Phoenix Wright and the Professor Layton series, and have to say even stacked against these, this has turned out to be truly one of the best written games I've ever played. I say \\"game\\" but it's more akin to a \\"visual novel\\" with puzzle mini-games.<br />To get an idea of what's in store, just imagine if Lost was written or directed by Wes Craven, or you mashed up Saw with a Choose Your Own Adventure book, but in actuality that is only the tip of the iceberg for this game. You play as Junpei, a normal college student who, for no apparent reason, finds himself trapped with 8 strangers, on a ship that is about to sink and forced to play a twisted life or death game called \\"The Nonary Game\\". In order to escape, you must solve puzzles (involving maths or logic for example) within the locked rooms of the ship.<br />At first glance, the characters may appear to be simple anim&eacute; stereotypes - a large mountain man, an eye candy woman in an exotic dancer outfit, and a pink haired schoolgirl type, but as you play more and more to discover the mystery, you begin to uncover their personalities and they really do seem believable and like real people. I grew to care for them as if they were my friends.<br />How you react to certain characters genuinely affects the story if you, for example, go through a different door or team up with other people.<br />The graphics in the game may seem basic with not much actual animation of characters (though each of them is very well drawn) but there is much more detail in the background so they work well, and much of the games' tension and atmosphere is accomplished through the use of text and sound. The soundtrack is fantastic, with (among other things) splendid creepy moments achieved with simple piano cues. Whatever you do, try not to play this at night.<br />I was really moved (I won't spoil anything for you, but in fact at some points I was crying) and also piqued by genuine fear in other places. The descriptions in this game are very detailed and graphic with some strong language so, with good reason the game has a US Mature rating (and would probably get at least a 15 rating in the UK). I'm not a prude but the imagery (for example of a dead body) and what it feels like, is so on the button I often felt queasy. The salty language used by some of the group and their reactions, seemed realistic to me however, given the terrifying situation these characters were in.<br />Also, if you don't like reading this may not be the game for you, as there is a great amount of text and I mean a LOT. But it's so well written and localised sometimes I thought it could make good material for a movie or actual paper novel. What we have here is not just amazing \\"game\\" writing but material that deserves to be compared with other media in my opinion.<br />Despite the darkness there is also humour and some jokes in this game which was genuinely funny and some things your companions say made me laugh too. The writing does a superb job of conveying how the characters feel, at times highlighting their sense of dread, confusion and helplessness and we are at one with them, so often you too will be thinking to yourself \\"What are we doing here?! Just what the hell is going on?!\\"<br />The game also excels for me because you really need to complete it multiple times in order to learn more and truly understand everything in the story. When I had completed it once I couldn't wait to start it again. This makes the game have excellent replay value.<br />But with this comes a drawback (unfortunately), which is that I sometimes found it annoying having to play through the puzzles that I'd already done before when replaying, even if I can speed through the text. This also had the effect of making the urgency in the game (which is very well done otherwise) feel uneven at times.<br />The puzzle mechanic is wrapped up with some pretty complex ideas (for starters, actual historical events, scientific theory) in a genuinely moving and engrossing story that blew my mind. Seriously, few games if ever have made me think as deeply as this about the overall mythology and enigma of the events taking place, and what I've been involved in. In fact it's not just a game, but an experience. One which I was honestly pleased to have had, but was also very upset when it was finally over.<br />I loved it so much, I didn't want it to end.<br />I really would recommend this game to any lovers of mysteries. Its' incredible, compelling storyline, often challenging puzzles, humour, many scenes of emotion and pathos, and profound characters make it a treat to play. I really hope more games like this will be released on the DS and other systems.y moving and engrossing story that blew my mind.

This morning I got up, fed the dog, and continued reading till now. I am done: now I can confidently begin a fruitful journey to help others much more effectively.      I feel this is the best book on marketing I have ever read! It suits my personality. I am low key, non-pushy, love people, and want to create value for my readers, who are very loyal and trust what I tell them.      So, John, thank you! Even the business plan for each section is down to earth, practical, and easily doable. One of the very first things I am going to do is to change my newsletter to a blog format !

0439023521|5.0|I do not have time to write as lengthy a review as this book deserves, however I just wanted to put my opinion out there and say this was one of my favorite books ever! I absolutely loved it. I have read some of the one-star reviews that people have written about this book and I cannot understand why people would have rated it one star. This book is a commentary about the brutality that all people are capable of committing and yet a few stand up to the oppressive government and try to make a better situation for themselves. Isn't that what all rebels in history have tried to do?     I think that everyone should give this book a chance, and not look at the surface of the story but delve deeper into the heart of what SC was trying to convey, that even though life may seem helpless at times, there is always a way to alleviate your situation to make it better! Again, I loved this book very much and even if you disagree with me, I will always know that this book is beautifully written and it conveys an important message (as does the entire trilogy!).
B0055B0MIO|3.0|Trivium are one of those young bands trying to invent themselves, they have never really been able to remain consistent amongst any one particular sound or musical genre. First they start out as a very melodic Swedish sounding band, then do a complete 360 into the Master Of Puppets Metallica vein, which actually i didn't quite mind, because Metallica doesn't even sound like Metallica anymore. With Shogun you had a better mix of both worlds and the album was solid enough to stand up and be reckoned with and many people thought wow Trivium may have finally found there niche. Well with In Waves we see the confusion return. Many songs just run together, with a few strong tracks like In Waves, Watch The World Burn, and A Skylines Severance being the best. Some of the other tracks are notable but it's really nothing to stand up and take notice off. The clean singing is much different this time around and really gives a nod (perhaps to much of one) to Soilwork. The title track In Waves is especially one of those tracks that if you knew nothing of Trivium or this album you would think, hey a new Soilwork song!!    So the album isn't horrible and it's nothing new or great, it's just Trivium doing what they do and being sub par at it. These guys are still mostly in their early 20's so i still think they are somewhat in musical puberty to say the least. Much like the early days of Slayer, Metallica, and Megadeth, their time will come. And i'm pretty certain Trivium will have there Seasons, Black Album and Countdown To Extinction. They just really need to find themselves and not rely so much on what they've heard from other bands. But as i said they are young so that's really the only blueprints they have to go by. In Waves will please only most hardcore fans of the band, but other than that, it's just another Trivium album with some elements taken from other bands. As usual. But hey, to each their own. I liked a few songs at least. And it's a lot better than the new Unearth Album.

159514188X|5.0|This is an incredibly moving story of how gossip, peer pressure and all the angst of growing up combine to lead Hannah, a high school girl, to commit suicide. Before her death she records a series of audio tapes in which she describes events that, connected to one another, all snowballed eventually to send her into a downward spiral.  She talks about extending trust on several occasions only to be let down repeatedly, even by so called friends.  Hannah repeatedly alludes to her reputation, smeared by bragging boyfriends and jealous girls, saying how people would rather believe what they've heard rather than what they know about you. There are 12 peers she addresses in her tapes and 1 teacher who is also her guidance counselor.      Clay, the listener in this story, agonizes over how he had liked Hannah but let opportunitites pass to get to know her and maybe have helped her.  He was afraid of what people might say about him.  It demonstrates how our actions and inactions work together.  No action is an isolated incident. I think it's especially important for teens to get this message because I think they have a hard time understanding how far-reaching their actions and words can be.  As a mother of an 8th grader I really feel this should be recommended reading for all teens.    There is no bad language is this book and only 1 scene near the end where she participates in a sexual act with a boy, described very matter-of-factly in a couple sentences. Asher handles this very heavy topic quite well and provides a Q&A at the end that gives some insight on how he came to write this story.  I did shed a couple tears when Clay reached his story on the tapes, as it was mostly for his regret in not following through on his feelings for her.  It does end on a positive note and will inspire you to be more considerate in word and deed.  Excellent book, highly recommended.
0545259088|3.0|I was so disappointed with the final book. I totally didn't get the end. I was enjoying the plot only for it to end all of the sudden. I loved reading all three books in this series but the end was a bummer. If you read this review Maggie, you are a fabulous writer but why did it end like that? You left too many untied ends for my taste. Great series, I'm glad I read them even if the end wasn't what I expected.
6305511055|5.0|\\"Three Days of the Condor\\" is a political thriller released in 1975, based loosely on the novel \\"Six Days of the Condor\\" by James Brady. Joe Turner (Robert Redford), codename \\"Condor\\", works for the CIA researching foreign literature in New York City. Section 9 Department 17 has set up offices in a brownstone under the guise of the American Literary Historical Society. Joe recently sent a report to his superiors about a mystery novel that has been inexplicably translated into an odd assortment of languages despite its commercial failure. Joe goes out to pick up lunch for his co-workers. When he returns, he finds them all dead, murdered. He calls the CIA's \\"panic office\\" to report the incident, and they tell him that his superior in Washington, D.C., Wicks (Michael Kane), will bring him in. But Wicks tries to kill him, so Joe is on the run with no one to trust.<br /><br />This is one of those terrific political thrillers made in the 1970s on the heels of Watergate, the Vietnam War, and the oil crisis that capitalized on the public's distrust of government. The CIA is plagued with rogue operations and morally bankrupt. The intelligence community just plays games, as Deputy Director Higgins (Cliff Robertson) explains to Joe. The good guys use the same methods, and often the same \\"free-lancers\\", as the bad guys. The assassin responsible for the carnage, Joubert (Max von Sydow), is the ultimate pragmatist. He has no need to believe in a side. He takes no interest in his employers and believes only in his work. Morally bankrupt, he is the only player with an objective viewpoint. The CIA is portrayed as a bastion of cynicism more than an agency of Cold Warriors.<br /><br />Watching \\"Three Days of the Condor\\" in 2011, I was forced to conclude that reality is darker than leftist filmmakers of the 1970s imagined. That surprised me. Of course, the real CIA is not so goofy as to countenance high-level rogues who massacre their own agents in the middle of Manhattan. But I was taken aback when Higgins says that the American public would not object to the invasion of a Middle Eastern nation if we ran out of oil or, worse, food. In reality, it didn't take nearly that much for Americans to approve a war or two in the Middle East. Watching these old movies reminds me of how different global politics was during the Cold War, when the competition of two superpowers constrained their options to a large extent. And Joe's thinking is that the New York Times, freedom of the press incarnate, will save the day. No one would think that now.<br /><br />There is a charming naivet&eacute; amid \\"Three Days of the Condor\\"'s over-the-top cynicism. And Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway, who plays Kathy Hale, a woman whom Joe abducts on the street because he requires the use of her car, make a good-looking couple. For a man who's not a field agent -he just reads books- Joe is pretty good at phone hacking and breaking and entering. This is a paranoid political thriller, but it's smart, tightly written, and an interesting trip back to the skeptical 1970s. The DVD (Paramount 2006) includes a theatrical trailer (3 min).

B004ZZS4CC|4.0|The beginning of her story seems to written like an 11 year old girl would write.  I found myself thinking about why she did not escape, then I realized with blazing certainty that she was just 11.  What does a little girl know about running away when she has been taken care of all her life?  Her fear kept her there until her life became what it did. She was conditioned early to be the sex slave for a horrible man and all her life was about adapting.<br /><br />Later as she grew up into a woman, I wondered again why she did not escape and again I realized that she lived the life of a kidnapped child.  Fear has a way of controlling our intentions and thoughts.  I enjoyed her story and am still thinking about it.  I would recommend it to anyone.
0143038419|3.0|Eat Pray Love by Elizabeth Gilbert is a spiritual memoir. While at times engaging and interesting, it also tends to be whiny and annoying at times. It is always well written though. If one can get past the first half to two-thirds of the book, the end does pick up a bit. The descriptions of place, food, and moments in time are enticing. Gilbert's honesty about her struggles with meditation and silence will resonate with many readers. Her struggles with indulgences and her vows to herself are honest and raw almost to the point of leaving the reader feeling like a voyeuer.

B003Y5H53S|1.0|I'm not my kids' favorite person right now because I turned off Rango....we have been waiting for this new movie to come out to rent...only to shut off because of language. It is rated pg, but I believe it's over the top of this rating. It has language like \\"what the hell?\\" several times, and \\"damn\\"!!! It was also more violent than a kids' movie should be.....had things that were stereotypical that I got but the kids don't understand all the characters....these were a little extreme in the bad guy area.

B002VPE1AW|3.0|Avatar is a foil to [[ASIN:B004ALIG4M Withnail and I]].      1. Avatar isn't awfully bad. Withnail and I (W&I) is a great movie.    2. Avatar's sound track is tottaly forgettable. W&I opens with a live version of King Curtis playing a Whiter shade of pale. It is so cool that sharks are making a killing selling the original soundtrack: Be warned this track is not included on the CD included in current editions of W&I...I digress...    3. Avatar has \\"amazing computerized special effects\\". W&I has a shot of some desirable curtains from Laura Ashley.     4. Avatar is extraordinary similar in plot and script to Disney's Tarzan. In W&I The characters are multi-faceted one is able to identify with all the protagonists.     5. Loads of huffing and puffing in Power Rangers..I mean Avatar. W&I is full of iconic performances. Richard E Grant delivers an unforgettable Hamlet soliloquy.     6. Avatar is full of progressive pretexts (i.e. it's against primitive accumulation)for regressive sub texts (deploys the same dualist modus operandi that justifies primitive accumulation/accumulation by dispossession). W&I is an amoral romp. No bad guys or good guys.    7. Avatar was made on a massive industrial budget. W&I was made on a shoe string.     8. You can buy Avatar for around $10 you can buy W&I for 7c     9. Avatar encourages smoking by reinforcing it's association with emancipation. W&I introduces the Camberwell Carrot. This will encourage the impressionable to engage in origami.    10. Avatar: Serious, luscious, tropical, dry, warm, Always Sunny .. W&I: Hilarious, tragic, grey, torrential rain....

B00007KWHO|4.0|In my ears there is a huge progression from Yes' debut album to this one.  In the first album you could hear the potential for what was to come.  On Time and a Word it had arrived.  Songs like The Prophet or Astral Traveller can be placed alongside just about any of their later material and still hold their own.  And my favorite, Everydays, though not written by Yes has a sophistication of sound that any band would be proud of.<br /><br />I'm sure some people find the small orchestra distracting.  I think they did a great job using it tastefully - the sound is fully their own.  In some ways I think it gives a hint of the more orchestral sounds the band would achieve later in their career, particularly with addition of Wakeman in a couple of years.<br /><br />On first run through after years away I was about to write the most glowing review of an album ever.  Then I listened to The Yes Album.  With Time and a Word Yes had come a long way in establishing their unique sound and creating some very sophisticated music, but the best was definitely yet to come.....

0553381695|3.0|I just finished reading this book (really audio book don't think I would have stamina to read this type of novel). Got 3/4 and had to go to to wikipedia to see what happened because it was just too slow. This reads more like daily fantasy soap than a novel. Too much killing and raping not enough movement of the story. I will wait to see this on HBO maybe it will make me interested again to read 1000 pages for the next 5 novels.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|For a movie whose trailer seemed fake at first glance (a serious drama about a superintelligent ape and his issues?), RotPotA (rot-POT-uh) does an incredible job getting you invested in the plight of a chimp. Low budget for a summer blockbuster, this ninety million dollar film focuses on the rise of Caesar, first of his species and leader of the apes. We watch as he grows up, casts off his human friendships, and eventually leads a revolt in the hopes of achieving freedom for his people, err, his fellow apes.<br /><br />Whether or not you're going to like this movie boils down to one thing: can you buy into it? Can you lay your hard-earned money on the line and accept Caesar as a fully human character with hopes and fears? Since the actual humans are sort of irrelevant and the apes are incapable of speech, there's not a lot to go on. Basically, if you liked the first 40 minutes of Wall-E, then you'll probably be fine. Caesar may not be a lovable trash robot (or is he?! Twist!), but Andy Serkis does an incredible job conveying his feelings through his motions. Serkis must've spent years living among the apes of the wild to achieve such realistic mimicry (he went to Rwanda and chilled in zoos!), and he strikes epic and expressive poses aplenty, each one conveying Caesar's thoughts without feeling obvious and overblown. By the end of the movie, you'll care more about Caesar than any actual human (in the film--hopefully not in real life). You'll fear for his friends and root for his victory. Honestly, an ape that likable? I'll let him rise above me any day.<br /><br />Once you're down with the movie's premise, and once you're finally ok with Franco's whole \\"Let's make a much more aggressive form of this untested virus! What could possibly go wrong?\\" line of thinking, you're ready to experience a truly great film.<br /><br />The movie builds and builds, each scene more intense than the last. Watching Caesar slowly learn to despise humanity is fantastic, and when he finally becomes a total champion, you're with him all the way. There's a moment when the music changes and Caesar first uses a basic tool to win his freedom, and I couldn't have been more stoked. Then he goes on to recruit his friends, who are all hardcore. I wasn't really sure what their names were, so I made my own: Grayback, the original leader whom Caesar overthrows, Jowly, the friendly circus orangutan with giant, jiggling jowls, Kong, the huge gorilla, and Scar, the one-eyed embodiment of evil. While they cannot be as well drawn as normal human characters due to the lack of dialogue, I still had a distinct understanding of each of their personalities.<br /><br />Just like I distinctly understood Draco Malfoy's new character. He once again nailed the sniveling jerk role. I hated that guy so much. He was just so mean to the apes! I guess what he didn't count on was that they'd all become superintelligent. Nobody expects that (in that way, it's like the Spanish Inquisition). His somewhat subpar predictive powers aside, he does get the best Planet of the Apes reference, shouting, \\"Take your stinking paws off me, you d*mn dirty ape!\\"<br /><br />It's people like that who'll make the apes kill us all, which reminds me: the climax of this movie is crazy epic. It takes place on the Golden Gate bridge, and it's unbelievably fun to watch the ramshackle ape army use their new intelligence to take on the unprepared humans.<br /><br />Not everything was perfectly executed, but all the problems feel like pointless nitpicks. Some characters agree to things a little too quickly, one or two lines are just a little off, Franco gives up on freeing Caesar super easily, the girlfriend should've had either a much larger or much smaller role, and they don't show some scenes of the other apes getting exposed to the intelligence drug (I just assume they cut that scene but that it happened). Also, the entire audience laughed at the epic/heartwarming scene between James Franco and Caesar in the forest at the end, and while it did feel a little ridiculous, it's that same issue I brought up before. You have to buy into this film. You have to let go of that cynical part of you and allow yourself to enjoy what you're seeing. The movie takes its premise 100% seriously, and there's no room for laughter.<br /><br />In the end, this film is so good that I found myself lost in it. I was unaware of the music, the pacing, the acting, everything, because I was just too busy being completely invested and enjoying the heck out of myself. I cannot wait for the sequel. In a rare piece of cinema, this movie managed to feel complete on its own and yet leave you craving more. If you had to see one film this summer (and you didn't care about the cultural impact of Harry Potter), this would be it.<br /><br />Score: 4.5/5 ¢<br /><br />One of the best end credits ever. Rarely do I actually care about what's happening in the background behind the names, but here I was devastated.<br /><br />Check out more on \\"The Nickel Screen\\" (Google it!)tle ridiculous, it's that same issue I brought up before.

B00007KWI9|3.0|Note - I am talking the material from the original album - at the end I will mention bonus material. Note 2 - 3 stars because this isn't at the level of their 4 star & 5 star work....<br /><br />It's all there - Jon Anderson is doing his thing, Chris Squire's bass style, a constant in Yes, is there, Peter Banks has developed a style that Howe would later use as his basis of departure, Tony Kaye's keyboard style is often distinctive Yes and Bill Bruford is beating out early Yes rhythms.  Only, it rarely jells into the sound I would call \\"Yes\\".<br /><br />For the most part the music is pretty safe - heavy Beatles influence (like everyone back then) but trying to create a new sounds.  I would say this is the only Yes album that I can clearly hear their influences as loudly as their own style.  In a way this is closer to late British psychedelic than early progressive rock.<br /><br />Every so often, though, you can hear the Yes-that-will-be emerging.  A lot of bands in 1969 wrote long songs with different segments in different feels yet on a couple of tracks, such as Survival, you get a good taste of where they'll take the extended composition.<br /><br />Overall this is very enjoyable (even a non-Yes fan will enjoy it) but not great.  Well, it can be great if you listen to the potential that you'll hear in later albums because it is there if you listen...<br /><br />Bonus tracks - I really don't know why this music is presented here since it seems to belong with Time and a Word.  In fact, to my ears it goes a long way to prove my points above - when Everydays starts it seems to be entering a new sonic universe.  I'm glad they did include Something's Coming - I'm a big Bernstein fan and thinks it's great they did a Westside Story track that wasn't America, Tonight, etc (though riffs from those songs appear).<br /><br />Just for reference - I have spent years away from Yes but have immersed myself in them for the last couple of weeks.  I've listen to this several times through and have compared it to their other works.  For all of their music I am hearing it with fresher ears than I ever have....rks.  For all of their music I am hearing it with fresher ears than I ever have....
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Jane Eyre is my all time favorite book.  So, any movie version of this book always gets my attention.  I have now bought every rendition available.  Prior to viewing this, the George C Scott/Susannah York version had been my favorite.  After viewing this one, George and Susannah took a back seat, albeit a close back seat.  The first time I watched this one, I watched it through twice -- I was that enthralled.  Then, I bought it and watched it again, and yet again with my daughter.  I just recently viewed it once more when I found out a new version had come to DVD.  (I have now seen the newest big screen version, 2011, and didn't like it at all.) Having now watched this version at least five (5) times, it still stands up as being my all-time favorite.      Toby Stephens is wonderful as Edward Rochester, who both confounds and teases Jane; and Jane, as played by Ruth Wilson, amply gives back as good as she is given, which only serves to further intrigue Edward.  Edward is a man who has given up on life and love, and sees a renewal of hope for both through Jane.  It's no wonder he did what he did, although admittedly wrong, for that promise of renewed life and love.     The love story line is very well developed.  And, attention is given as to how Edward met and married his crazy \\"bats in the belfry\\" wife.  Also, attention is given as to exactly how Edward came to have Adele as his ward.  I feel the young lady who plays Adele captures the essence of this girl. I don't even mind the time spent with St John and his sisters.  It was very well done.  So many aspects and details of the book were given proper attention, as opposed to the newest 2011 version, which I feel was chopped and rushed.    This movie made me fully believe in and feel the love and passion that slowly developed between the two characters.  For me, the bedroom scene after the failed marriage did not detract from the story.  I know this did not happen in the book, but it served to further enhance to me their great love and passion for each other.  So, the liberty taken here was fine with me.  It made me feel even more their tremendous pain and grief in the loss of each other.    The movie begins at the very beginning with Jane as a young girl, being abused and mistreated by her aunt et al, and progresses to the conclusion in fine order.  The ending goes further than any other movie version I've seen.  Whether or not it fully follows the letter of the book is of no importance to me, as I love the ending.  This is how I would imagine them to be -- but now don't have to imagine -- both free to love and free to be happy at last.
B004Y1USV2|5.0|I have been a \\"Yes\\" fan since 1970 (Yes Album). Seen them in concert 5 times. 3 of those front row center. Have almost every album (now cd's) in my collection. This latest cd 'Fly From Here' is just as good as the 'Yes' album was in 1970. Although the line up of musicians has changed (as they have on almost every production) I must say that they still have a classic & unique sound that is completely 'Yes'.    Benoit David have proven he is more than just a John Anderson mimic on this his first studio project. He is in my opinion a worthy member of the group and adds his own personal touch to the vocals. The rest of the band members are 'superb' as always and the recording-production quality is top notch. I just hope these guys can continue to make and play great music for many years to come...
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Hands down the best superhero movie I have seen. In a summer with a lot of let downs, this movie lived up to and surpassed any hype that was given to it. The graphics are spectacular, the acting was spot on, and the dialogue was right on the money. I was wary of the cast at first, especially Chris Hemsworth, but I am not afraid to admit I was wrong. This movie is a must-see for anyone looking for a great movie. Overall, great job marvel!!!

0553801473|4.0|People (long time fans) are upset about this book not because it was bad but because it didn't make the progress they hoped it would. I get it, you waited for five years and Martin didn't tell you who Jon Snow's mother was or answer your other questions. Yes, this book moves the story forward but it did not move it as far along as they would have liked.<br /><br />I just started reading the books this summer. Martin is as descriptive as ever, Tyrion is as charming as ever and there's no Brianne or Catelyn chapters so you don't have to suffer through those. The book has a few nice surprises I won't spoil here but ultimately it doesn't stand up to Game of Thrones or Storm of Swords because it lacks an airtight conclusion. I felt that only one arc was truly complete and left me truly satisfied.<br /><br />In the end I enjoyed this book and I look forward to how it is going to get the rumor mill going for the last entry. The new surprises are sure to shake things up. The weakness of this book lies squarely on the shoulders of the Mereen side of the story. The book doesn't make the progress you hoped but it is a well written return for many characters you know and love.

0811875040|2.0|The photos are gorgeous. The cakes look immaculate. The recipes are errenous (as already mentioned numerous times in reviews), but most importantly, the recipes are bad bad bad. That's what you get for buying a cookbook for its pretty pictures, I guess.    The first thing I made was the honey tea cake. The batter looked good, the batter smelled good. The book told me to bake for 30 minutes and test for doneness by inserting a toothpick. The toothpick came out clean, so I cut into it.    It looked like the cake threw up on itself. The middle was still raw and liquid. The toothpick came out clean because the liquid smeared on the outer baked shell before it had a chance to stick to the toothpick.    Fine. I can accept the fact that maybe my oven temperatures are off (but off by THIS MUCH?). But when I tried to eat the part that was cooked, I was again disappointed. It was dense. Like xmas-fruitcake-from-2005 dense. The flavor was OK, but but texture was terrible. For a company named \\"miette,\\" named after \\"crumb\\" I would have thought they specialized in crumbly cakes.    Recipe two: shortbread cookies. I baked these puppies after firming them up in the fridge like the recipe asked me to. The result: runny cookies. Perhaps there was too much butter, or perhaps there was not enough flour. Either way, these cookies ran. They were ugly, and looked nothing like the ones in the book.    That's the problem with buying a baking book with such pretty pictures. I've seen more truth in product photography in a McDonald's commercial. But more importantly, the things in the book just don't taste as good.    I just learned Meg Ray (author) came in dead last at the Food Network cupcake competition in the taste category. Skip this book!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  It is a lot of fun to play, the levels escalate in difficulty well, without staying too easy and getting boring, or getting hard too quickly.  It also, keeps changing with the type of level, and the different kinds of zombies and plants.  I've played several other Android games, and so often I lose interest after I play it a few times.  I've been playing this game for over a week, and I'm still really into it.  To me that says this game has a quality of game play that exceeds many others in the mobile space.

B0055B0MIO|5.0|An amazing record in all perspectives. This album has pulled the elements from all previous Trvium albums and has exelled Trivium's talent in another dimension. The guitar riffs are very solid build with an unquie powerful sound. I believe the guitars are very well structured and destroys the ordinary heavy metal album riffs. Drums are exectuded in a very dinamic and rhytmic beat. Of course Trivium's melodyc guitars are flawsless. Amzing solos. Heavy's vocals are amzing and go very well with the lyrics. Trivium has pulled an amazing record and has outshined itself. The only thing I did not like was the whimpsy paper packaging. I prefer a solid album that will not deterior after a year. A+
B004EBUXSA|5.0|I apologize in advance if this review is a little vague on some of the specs of this CPU. I'm not doing this FROM that computer, so I don't have any of the exact details to go off of.<br /><br />I've had a handful of computers [desktops and laptops, including a $5,000 Sager 9262 I bought in 2008] over the years, but they've always been pre-assembled, and I've always wanted to build my own desktop gaming rig. Having just gotten back home from Afghanistan, I had a bit of cash to finally throw into an attempt.<br /><br />I won't go TOO into details on my rig, but I got the Corsair Obsidian 800D with a Gigabyte GA-P67A-UD7-B3 Motherboard (Mobo), GeForce GTX 570x2, Intel SSD, and Corsair 16gb of DDR3 1600Mhz RAM. And of course, the i7 2600K.<br /><br />#1 - Installation - First of all, installing this thing was a cinch. [For my motherboard] All I had to do was lift the locking mechanism up, remove the dust guard, set the CPU on the contacts of the Mobo, and lock it down. I second-guessed myself when I did this, thinking it should have been a smidgen more difficult, but nope. Simple as that.<br /><br />After installing every other component in my case, and turning this bad boy on, I immediately went into the bios to check it out. You can get pretty deep into the settings on this Mobo, but I got the hang of it rather quickly and familiarized myself with the capabilities of this processor. I didn't overclock it right off the bat (good idea for anyone), so I could get a baseline performance test (before and after, so to speak). I installed the OS and whatnot, followed by a few games like Crysis, Bioshock 2, Arma 2, etc.<br /><br />#2 - Overclocking - The factory clock on this is 3.4Ghz (multiplier of 34). I'm currently pushing 4.4Ghz (or a multiplier of 44) with AIR COOLING, and without getting extremely hot. I plan on getting liquid cooling over time, but I'll wait for that.<br /><br />#3 - Performance - As I'm not at that computer right now (doing this from work), I don't remember my exact framerate (FPS) in these games, I CAN tell you that it's extremely good. If I remember correctly, I got around 65 FPS on Crysis, and ARMA 2 with all graphics settings maxed out. I know that half of that may be the 570s, but this CPU helps A LOT!<br /><br />#4 - Price - For $340, this thing blows the concept of \\"getting a deal\\" out of the water! The 2600K is regularly compared against the 990x in stats and performance, and the 990x is nearly $1,000!<br /><br />All in all, I give this thing a 5 out of 5. It's a bargain price for some high-performance, and high-quality hardware. It'll slaughter anything you throw at it, and then some. It's compatible with all current-gen GPUs and most RAM.<br /><br />I definitely recommend getting this CPU if you're planning on building your own gaming computer. It's way beyond nice to have. It's one of the most powerful consumer CPUs out there, and by far the best power-to-dollar ratio out there.es, I CAN tell you that it's extremely good.

B0013FXWU6|4.0|[[ASIN:B0013FXWU6 There Will Be Blood]]<br />There Will be Blood<br /><br />Paul Thomas Anderson's 2007 classic \\"There Will be Blood\\" is a searing portrayal of ambition, greed, and betrayal set in Southern California in the early 20th century. It is the story of  Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), a silver miner-turned oil wildcatter and his climb from poverty to great wealth.  Along the way it examines the cult of evangelism, the strength of family relationships, and the emotional toll exacted by gaining success at any price.<br /><br />Thematically, the movie is loosely based on Upton Sinclair's<br />Novel \\"Oil!, which in turn is based partly on the life of Edward L. Doheny, of Teapot Dome infamy.  In the movie, Plainview's son H.W. becomes deaf when the big gusher comes in.  In real life, Doheny's son Ned was killed in a murder-suicide involving his male secretary and purported lover.  The killings took place at Greystone Mansion, the enormous house the elder Doheny built for his son.  The mansion is the setting for the final scene of the movie, which I won't divulge.<br /><br />The cast is uniformly excellent, especially Paul Dano as Eli Sunday who also plays his brother Paul.  Eli is an ambitious evangelist, intent on growing his church with Plainview's money, which comes from the oil from the Sunday family's ranch.<br />One element of the movie that didn't work for me was the introduction of a drifter, who shows up one day claiming to be Plainview's half-brother.  Inconsistencies show up in his story, and in a fit of rage Plainview takes his revenge.<br />I've purposely held off discussing Daniel Day- Lewis's performance until last.  There is no disputing the intensity of Day-Lewis's acting, but for me, it was too over-the-top.<br />Day-Lewis is notoriously avoidant of interviews and self-explanation, so we are dependent on the performance alone to determine his character's motivation.<br />I give the movie four and a half stars... taking off one star for the poor packaging the CD comes in.  It's a cheap piece of cardboard like you find in supermarket discount \\"dollar DVD's\\" and a lousy way to market a product.e poor packaging the CD comes in.

B003L77FYS|4.0|I truly enjoyed Castle's 3rd season, but I am starting to wonder whether the show is \\"jumping the shark.\\"    The whole part of the premise involving Castle using Beckett for research for his book seems to be fading away, which is a shame because but I really liked the insight the show gave into how a writer thinks and creates his characters. In fact, the last few shows of Season 3 don't even have the opening explaining the show's premise that has been used since Season 1.     It's a nice inside joke during Season 3 about why Castle is helping Beckett solve crimes now that the book with the character that's based on her has been published, but after while, it left me wondering how plausible the series is with Castle as just another unofficial crime solver.
B003XQRZ7E|4.0|I am a huge fan of the the musicians in this band . I'm a classic rocker form late sixties to early eighties. Then alot of bands like REO , Old Journey before Steve Perry and even one of the greatest classic rock bands Aerosmith sold out to air play on the radio . Not one of the guys in this band ever had much air play if any . For me this cd is a breathe of fresh air . Recorded in a week . The songs are longer than three minutes or so . Except the the opening track Black Country. Which by the way ROCKS ! I really don't think they  got together and said lets crank on the airways . It has the sound of a album almost a live in concert sound to it . The more I listen to it the more I realize how good this cd is . It does come with a dvd which explains all views for creating this cd . also a few tracks live in concert on the dvd . I would have given this cd a 5 star rating . If it wasn't for Glenn Hughes screaming instead of using his God giving awsome voice ! Thier second cd is better than the first . The songs are tighter  Joe ,Glenn , Jason and Derek bring back classic rock better than anything I have heard in a decade if not more . I bought Chicken Foot , Them crooked vultures . I like both bands  . My opion . It's like comparing apple's to orange's I think these guys are one step ahead of the others .
0811875040|4.0|I LOVE Miette, and as soon as I found out about this cookbook I ordered it. I made the salted caramels, and was pleasantly surprised with my results. I got an email which stated that there were numerous mistakes in the book, but it had a link to the corrections. I was also told I'll be mailed a new book when they are reprinted. Happy with what I've made so far, and how I will (hopefully) get a new one with all the corrections.
0439023521|5.0|This book had been recommended to me by a teacher/friend.  I thought it maybe too childish reading but I was pleasantly surprised.  It did take about 20 - 30 pages before I was totally engrossed in it then I could not set it down.  I took this on vacation and sadly did not have book 2 because I finished it in no time.  Very well written and keeps you on the edge anxious to see what happens next.

B002JVWQT6|5.0|An outright laugh riot! This show is one of the best to have come along in quite some time and the BluRay transfer is absolutely phenomenal. I would recommend this to most anyone who enjoys a good laugh and considering it is available on amazon you could get it in as few as 2 days! Simply Amazing.
B004YXE438|5.0|I don&apos;t like picture puzzles in the real world, so I wasn&apos;t even seriously considering this application. However, since it was free, I installed it. Believe it or not, I actually enjoy working these puzzles. For that reason, I have to give this app five stars.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|I was a Military Police Desk Sargent stationed in Illishime Germany when this was made in my control area (Rottener Au Taber) (Spelling may not be correct) in 1967 when this was being filmed. I got to see the actual location of some of the scenes (where Car parked under bridge, inside of walled city), and I was delighted to see it when it was released in 1968. I bought this DVD so my Grand Daughter could see where I was stationed but also a Great Family Movie!!!!!!!!!!!  LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!
B0040UAYI4|5.0|The Eagle Eye Converter finally arrived. After updating my EEC firmware and checking out the calibration database, I was able to play Killzone 3 better than I ever could with the MOVE. I did have to do just a little bit of calibrating, but once I did, it was an amazing experience.    I am a PC vet but most of my friends are playing console shooters because they find it just too expensive to be upgrading their computers every couple years just to run the newest games.  They have kept telling me to give the console shooters a try.  I have tried and failed due to my inability to aim with the analog stick.      I debated on getting the FragFX, FRAGnStein, and the Eagle Eye Converter.  I chose the EEC because of the vast customization options.  I am able to use the mouse of my choice (Logitech G500).  I am able to assign ps3 controller button inputs on my keyboard to match to what I'm used to on PC.    The EEC isn't exactly perfect PC to console conversion.  After I have put in a few hours with this device, I have become lost in the immersion and can no longer tell the difference between the EEC and PC gaming.    I think the EEC is a wonderful device and any PC vet trying to decide what peripheral to get, you will be most pleased with the Eagle Eye Converter.  The only regret I have is that I didn't purchase this sooner.      Update:  I recently purchased Battlefield: Bad Company 2.  I am having a blast playing this game.  I have tweaked the EEC to where, to me, it feels like I'm playing on the PC.  There is no jagged movement of any kind...even when sniping.  I can honestly say that the EEC has changed my view on console shooters.    You can go to PeguinUnited.com and browse through their database of user uploaded configurations for just about any FPS.  They have provided excellent customer service and have a wonderful community to boot.      Thank you Penguin United for the awesome device and service.
B0050PYNN0|5.0|One reviewer (David Edelstein)summed this movie up perfectly by saying it is a mixture of high and low brow humor. They rely heavily on this ironic, anachronistic dialogue throughout the film and for me I never grew tired of it.   This is not a parody. It's written as a straightout fantasy adventure. The protagonist played by Danny McBride is so incredibly self-centered though that he is a comical character. Everyone else has to more or less play it straight, but that's part of the humor.  I had to see this because I loved the trailer for Your Highness and upon the film's release it was universally panned, except for the Edelstein review. Fascinating.  It's not a stoner comedy, and it's not nearly as raunchy as some people make it out to be.
B004U52VPS|5.0|I bought this for my 4 year old son who loves playing Angry Birds and he absolutely loves making \\"real\\" Angry Birds games to knock down. He laughs and laughs when the birds go flying across the room to \\"get those piggies!\\" Definitely a great game for kids and adults alike.
1932100660|5.0|I honestly believe that The China Study is one of the most important books of our time.  We have been so wrong with how we think of nutrition. Dr. Campbell is blazing a hard trail through years of misinformation.  At some point we will have to look around at the obesity, diabetes, cancer & heart disease rates and realize that we really did get nutrition wrong.  But its not too late to learn.  I have turned my life around by incorporating Dr. Campbell's teachings.  My mother has eliminated her arthritis just by changing her diet.  My father lost his big American belly and even his hair grew back.  (Seriously!  Its the best side effect of healthy eating he could have ever imagined!)  Change can be hard. But this information is real and compelling enough to get you to begin to change.    READ THIS BOOK!
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|This was a really good movie. The Suspense really kept you on the edge of your seat. I Think that the young woman in the movie should have survived.. that is the only flaw! lol A Great Movie, that i will deffinatally watch again.
0345529057|5.0|I gave this 5 stars because I ordered the paperback version of the books. For around 20$, getting all four books with pretty cool artwork is a steal. It basically comes as promised.     The books themselves are very good, especially if you are a fan of the tv show.    If I was to rate the kindle version, I'd give it 0 stars if I could. The organization is terrible, chapters are missing, and it isn't even split up into seperate books. The kindle version isn't even worth 5$.
B002VECM4A|5.0|WARNING----THIS MOVIE HAS VERY STRONG LANGUAGE!<br /><br />Okay, I Don't mean this to sound bad, but the movie did get super funny at times. But, i dont know if they intended some parts to make you laugh, or what. Such as the scene with the social worker.. I Laughed my head off. But, Im not a jerk, it was just funny..lol. But overall, the movie is depressing, and it really wakes you up, and open's your eyes to what some people go through. Some parts also, are really sad. A Really great movie, that i WILL watch again!
B0001IN0DA|4.0|In 1985 Vince McMahon gambled everything he and his company had on bring sports entertainment to the massives in a grand PPV experience titled Wrestlemania and held it at Madison Square Garden. 20 years later the WWE brings their biggest PPV of the year back to MSG.<br /><br />Disc 1<br /><br />-United States Championship Match: Big Show (Champion) vs. John Cena: Show had held the U.S. title for about 5 months and no one had been able to stop him up to this point. Actually for most of the match Show just dominates Cena, chopping and slamming him. Cena does make a comeback even hitting an FU but Show kicks out. Cena then hits Show with his chain and hits a second FU and makes the cover to win the U.S. title. 6/10.<br /><br />-Coach is in Eric Bischoff's office and Eric tells him to go look for the Undertaker. Coach understandably doesn't look too pleased about it.<br /><br />-Randy Orton, Ric Flair and Batista talk about their upcoming handicap match where they say they'll take out Foley and Rock.<br /><br />-Fatal Four Way Match for the World Tag Team Championship: RVD & Booker T (Champions) vs. The Dudley Boyz vs. Garrison Cade & Mark Jindrak vs. La Resistance: Not a bad fatal four way, but it seemed kinda thrown together. All teams did get a couple of spots in but its over quick with RVD and Booker retaining their titles. 5/10.<br /><br />-Coach is looking for the Undertaker, he hears some noise but it turns out to be Bobby Heenan and Mean Gene Okerlund with Mae Young and The Fabulous Moolah (one word, ack).<br /><br />-Chris Jericho vs. Christian: After months of build-up everything came to a head as Christian felt jealous of his best friend Jericho paying more attention to Trish than their friendship. This was actually the first good match of the night as both men knew each other very well from having teamed up for about a year prior to this. Both countered each others moves well and hit some good spots of their own. The end where Trish came down to help Jericho but turned on him shocked the audience however most people should've seen it coming. Christian hits the Unprettier for the win. 8/10.<br /><br />-Mick Foley is backstage and the Rock comes up to pump him up about the match, pretty good promo.<br /><br />-2 on 3 Handicap Tag Team Match: Rock N' Sock Connection vs. Evolution: After Orton had spit in Foley's face and punted him down some stairs, Foley made a return at the Royal Rumble and eliminated Orton. Now we have this match and its a good encounter, nice to see Rock back in the ring too. Rock and Flair have a good face/off with Rock even mocking Ric's strut. The match does end suddenly when Orton hits an RKO on Foley out of nowhere for the win. 7/10.<br /><br />-Highlights are shown from the Hall of Fame show, pretty touching comments by Bobby Heenan.<br /><br />-Playboy Evening Gown Tag Team Match, Sable & Torrie Wilson vs. Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie: Yes the women looked good, but there was no reason for this match to be here. 0/10.<br /><br />-Pretty cool segment backstage with Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit with them talking about their respective title matches.<br /><br />-WWE Cruiserweight Championship Open, Chavo Guerrero (Champion) vs. Jamie Noble vs. Funaki vs. Ultimo Dragon vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Nunzio vs. Tajiri vs. Shannon Moore vs. Billy Kidman: Done elimination style, two men are inside the ring, the other eight are out at ringside, when one is eliminated another comes in. It was nice to see Ultimo on a grand PPV stage like Wrestlemania and Kidman later hits a huge Shooting Star Press to the outside on a few men. The match comes down to Rey and Chavo and after some cheating Chavo is able to retain his title. Not a bad match, 7/10.<br /><br />-Interpromotional Match, Goldberg (Raw) vs. Brock Lesnar (Smackdown) w/special referee Stone Cold Steve Austin: What should've been a fantastic power for power match was turned into one of the worst matches I've ever seen on PPV. Both men were leaving the company after this match, though Lesnar's were revealed a bit before this show and the crowd seemed to attack him more. Its such a bad match that the crowd starts chanting for Austin in the opening minutes of this match. Golderg ends up hitting the spear and Jackhammer to win. 2/10. Afterwards Austin stuns both men much to the crowds delight.<br /><br />-Mr. McMahon comes out and thanks the crowd for supporting them for all these years.<br /><br />-Fatal Four Way Match for the WWE Tag Team Championship: Scotty 2 Hotty & Rikishi (Champions) vs. APA vs. The Basham Brothers vs. The World's Greatest Tag Team: Like the Raw four way, this one while not bad seemed thrown together. Scotty and Rikishi do end up retaining. 5/10.<br /><br />Disc 2<br /><br />-Jesse \\"The Body\\" Ventura interviews Donald Trump who is in the crowd, pretty boring honestly.<br /><br />-WWE Women's Championship Match, If Molly Loses Her head Will be Shaved, Victoria (Champion) vs. Molly Holly: A good women's match, both tried really hard and got some good moves in. The finish came out of nowhere though as Victoria used a backslide to pick up the win. 6/10. The hair shaving afterwards actually made me pity Molly even though she knew it was coming.<br /><br />-WWE Championship Match, Eddie Guerrero (Champion) vs. Kurt Angle: Such great wrestling from both men, Eddie gets his chance to shine on the biggest stage in a main event and he doesn't disappoint. Of course Angle doesn't either as he always rises up and has a great match on the big stage. This was the definition of main event and both men kept this going at a great pace throughout. Eddie fights out of the ankle lock, loosens up his boot and when Angle goes for it again he gets just the boot in his hands. He rushes at Eddie and gets rolled up for the 3 count so Eddie retains his title. 10/10.<br /><br />-Undertaker vs. Kane: If I could rate this on build-up alone it would be a 10/10, as the promos and everything leading up to this match was top notch. The entrances were both good especially Takers as the crowd was on its feet from the opening gong. The match however was typical big man vs. big man, not bad but not great. Taker ends up hitting the Tombstone to win. 6/10.<br /><br />-Triple-Threat Match For The World Heavyweight Championship, Triple H (Champion) vs. Chris Benoit vs. Shawn Michaels: Easily one of the best triple threats I've seen as all three men get multiple moments to shine. There is some unexpected double teaming from Triple H and Shawn as they try to take out Benoit while he holds his own and takes it to both men. There's a sick spot where H and Michaels double suplex Benoit through an announce table. The closing moments are great as Michaels goes to superkick Benoit but gets thrown out of the ring, then Triple H tries for the pedigree but gets reveresed into the Crippler Crossface and after trying to get out of it for about a minute finally taps out. New World Champion Chris Benoit. 10/10. Nice moment afterwards where WWE Champion Eddie Guerrero comes into the ring and we see a good celebration between the long time friends.<br /><br />-Its a good PPV, but not quite up to par for what a 20 year anninversary show should be.

B000RGSOQY|5.0|I'm not a wanna be music critic like so many others on here, so I'll keep it simple:    It's good. If you only form your opinions based on what Clear Channel forces down your throat on the radio, you probably won't like it. But this is an outstanding record.
0553801473|2.0|Like other authors who have had a successful book series, Martin successful draws out the franchise.  The books time line is very short.  A more apt description for this book is a compilation of short stories rather than a rich world of characterless tied together by events.  The killing off of characters continues and only proves that Martin lacked vision for the progression of the story.  I will not continue reading the series after this book, Martin has turned this story into a soap opera that uses unlikely and ridiculous events to keep the reader entertained.  Case in point, don't build up the characteristics of a main character whose underlying traits drive his every action, then in the span of a couple paragraphs have him perform an about face.  Cheap and shallow suspense makes for a cheap and shallow story.
1439108277|5.0|I love this book. I teach high school physics and found myself highlighting so many sections of this book to refer back to when I get to these topics during the year.  He has lots of links to cool websites that illustrate topics he's talking about.  It might be a little hard to read if you haven't taken physics???  But if you remember your basic physics, it's a treasure trove of interesting info.  Really makes you want to have taken his classes at MIT, although as he points out in the book, you can watch him on MIT's website or youtube.  His enthusiam is infectious!  All we physics teachers should strive to make our topic fun and relevant to student's everyday  experiences- which Walter Lewin does.
1595141715|5.0|I have to say, this was a book unlike any other. Yes, some similarities to John Green's work -but much more intense. By the end of the book, I was so passionately PISSED at Hannah for killing herself I think I walked around in a huff for days. This is the perfect book for someone who has thoughts of suicide to read because suicide only hurts more people and you can just feel that emanating from Clay during the whole book. He barely even knew Hannah as a person and he was devastated by her suicide.<br /><br />There are so many great issues brought up in this book - suicide, teen drinking, sexuality, and more. To narrow it down, the whole reason Hannah kills herself is that she loses her identity in the swarm of rumors and horrible things that happened to her. She feels less like a person and can't keep living as one.<br /><br />The way the story is told is ingenious - as much as she was a total b*word for setting up something so terrible to send around AFTER she already killed herself. That being said, this is a must-read book. I loved the audio version and it drives you to really become passionate about the characters and what is going on. So, so good
B002T45VX6|2.0|I just finished listening to this record and her Greatest Hits album and there is no point of comparison between her songs back in the 90's and these ones now. One thing that sets Shakira apart from other singers is her talent for songwriting, but I feel that she left said talent in a handbag somewhere in the back of her closet, because you can put all the songs from this album in a blender and you won't get half a decent one from the days when she began her career. And I must add that I HATED IT when she did her crossover; would have honestly prefered her to stay and evolve within the Latin American market and we would still have \\"our\\" Shakira today, not this plastic doll of nowadays that bears no resemblance to the artist that brought us \\"Pies Descalzos\\" y \\"Donde Estan Los Ladrones\\".<br />I truly hope that she finds her compass and puts out an outstanding album, preferably in Spanish. Check Wikipedia for the sales of this and \\"Sale El Sol\\" and you will notice the drop on the amount of copies sold.
0446691437|4.0|\\"Most of us have two lives. The life we live, and the unlived life within us. Between the two stands Resistance.\\"    Sounds familiar? Most of us are very much aware that there could be a different life for us, but we continue our own treadmill. It is simply too hard to change, and if we attempt to do so, there are numerous blockages on the road that will discourage us. The good news is this. You are not alone. It is a natural resistance which comes in many forms, and it can be overcome.    Steven Pressfield's book is a joy to read and you'll finish it on a lazy day. The book comes in three sections. After defining the many forms of resistance we experience, Steven describes how we can combat resistance and become a creative professional. In the third section, he describes the higher realm, i.e. how to invoke the muse inside ourselves. Steven's writing is in a way mystical as well as down to earth. To live the unlived life is not mysterious but requires hard work. But it will be so much more rewarding since we will become more authentic and successful. \\"Our job in this lifetime is to find out who we already are and become it.\\"    If you want to pursue your dreams and get started, this book will definitely light a fire in you and encourage you to make the first step.

B000001ZS3|5.0|I personally believe Jean Michel Jarre's Oxygene album is more appropriate for fans of Mike Oldfield and specifically his first four albums instead of, say, Brian Eno's ambient period.  That's just me.  Brian Eno's ambient period (at least albums such as Discreet Music and Music for Airports) doesn't really strike me as being exceptionally melodic whereas *this* most certainly does.  The reason I believe Oxygene is more appropriate for Oldfield fans is because there's a strong focus on melodic development with Oxygene that Mike Oldfield mastered back in the 70's with albums such as Hergest Ridge and Ommadawn.  Fans of those albums need to hear Oxygene.      The music on Oxygene will probably make you think of the outdoors and especially the freezing cold, quiet wilderness up in Canada, Russia and Alaska.  At least that's what this music reminds *me* of.      \\"Oxygene Part One\\" reveals that synthesizers can be used just as creatively and melodically as any other musical instrument.  It also proves that Jean Michel Jarre had a talent for using synths in an adventurous way that honestly reminds me of 70's Genesis a little bit (especially albums such as A Trick of the Tail and Wind & Wuthering).  Not that it's a ripoff or anything- Genesis used synths for the purpose of combining them with songwriting and vocal melodies, whereas the synths here are used for a more atmospheric/adventurous purpose.    \\"Oxygene Part Two\\" has flutes and more synths, but more importantly a faster rhythm section to really take advantage of the dreamy atmosphere.   Whatever those explosion sounds are that come and go at random work like a thing of beauty.  I've heard those same unusual sounds in other songs by artists such as Camel and Steve Hillage, but never used as creatively as in this piece.  It's definitely a 70's-only piece of experimentation.  Overall, the song is a bit more repetitive than \\"Oxygene Part One\\" but not by much.  \\"Oxygene Part Three\\" has what I originally would have referred to as a scary tone totally appropriate for a horror film, but fans of this album have given me a different perspective by revealing that it actually signifies a change in pace and -depending just how much you're into this kind of music- it may even signify a change of lifestyle for yourself.  This interpretation is for those who like to pretend they are actually a part of the music.  However you'd like to interpet the piece is completely up to you.    \\"Oxygene Part Four\\" is just a groovy piece of enjoyable melody and nothing more.  \\"Oxygene Part Five\\" is the highlight of the entire album.  It's 10 minutes in length, and the theme is divided into two parts.  The first half focuses on some kind of really sad anthem with quietly performed synths chugging along in the background, and the second half is all about the faster paced \\"synths in overdrive\\" aspect, but with plenty of melody of course (it might *sound* messy at first, but give it a few careful listens to make sense of it and... it will make sense, I promise).  The dramatic synths utilized here are also a few years ahead of its time because several 80's artists used the same trick (such as Berlin's \\"Take My Breath Away\\").  The final piece titled \\"Oxygene Part Six\\" ends the album on a less creative and less synth-heavy note, but makes up for it with tons of melody and atmosphere.    Overall, yes, Mike Oldfield fans need to pick up this album as soon as possible.
0553801473|5.0|This book was everything I wanted it to be, and well worth the wait.  An excellent new verse to the Song of Ice and Fire.
B000001ZS4|5.0|First of all, that album cover is extremely freaky!  What is it supposed to be?  At first glance (or rather, for the first *several* glances) I thought it was a bunch of owls lined up in a row starring forward with a blank look in their eye (and plotting vengeance on human civilization!).  Now however, giving it a more accurate up close look, it appears to be a guy holding binoculars with his arms curved inwards.  It's unusual to say the least... much like the music itself.  Some people find beauty in this music, and I suppose that's partially true, but my mind chooses to focus on all the unusual experiments and weird synth tones underneath all this supposed \\"beauty\\".      \\"Equinoxe Part One\\" starts off with a short, anthemic-style synth melody before leading directly into the eerily haunting synth-dominated \\"Equinoxe Part Two\\".  It's really mellow and reminds me of somewhere totally abandoned.  This is totally focused around atmosphere and *no* melody whatsoever, which is a slight disappointment because Oxygene is entirely melodic.  The dingily-expressed and post apocalyptic atmosphere makes up for it though.  \\"Equinoxe Part Three\\" brings back the melodic aspect... and it's an incredibly lush, beautiful and totally satisfying melody too.  It wanders unfortunately, near the end.   Small complaint.    \\"Equinoxe Part Four\\" excels at being really melodic, fast-moving and totally reminiscent of classic Mike Oldfield.  Perhaps it should have been trimmed by a couple minutes because repeating more or less the same two parts numerous times in a row is  a bit much as far as the listeners level of patience is concerned (or at least, *my* level of patience) but I do like the song quite a bit.  On a side note, those high-pitched synth noises near the end resemble the ones used in Uriah Heep's \\"Sweet Lorraine\\".  \\"Equinoxe Part Five\\" starts off with an explosive thunder clap.  I almost expected another generic lightning clap such as what Black Sabbath and the Who had done on \\"Black Sabbath\\" and \\"Doctor Jimmy\\" respectively, but that's not the case at all.  Anyway, this song is *AWESOME!*  Perhaps it played a part in the foundation of the techno movement but not realized at the time since disco was popular and everything.  Either way, it's extremely melodic for sure, and irresistibly catchy.      \\"Equinoxe Part Six\\" carries us through an electronic theme once again, but now taken to a slower, more repetitive pace.  Not a favorite of mine, but the fact it sounds so ahead of its time is definitely worth noting.   \\"Equinoxe Part Seven\\" confirms that Jean Michel Jarre has finally settled into a widly experimental dance groove of sorts.  No longer are we experiencing the creepy atmosphere from side one- that all seems like a distant memory now.  Anyway, at nearly 7 minutes in length, the synths are memorable enough to get the job done, but I do wonder if it really *needed* to be 7 minutes.  Doesn't change the fact that what's repeating endlessly is actually *good* of course, and I suppose I'm underrating the final few minutes which features dreamy, futuristic-like atmosphere giving the piece a dramatic and fitting conclusion.  \\"Equinoxe Part Eight\\" starts off with some kind of French party music before quickly switching over to a return of the thunder and the theme from \\"Equnioxe Part Five\\" to finally end a pretty good -though less interesting musically compared to Oxygene- album.

Even if you hate comics, this one doesn't behave like a normal comic book film. The story is the best in the X-Men series. The acting is top-notch. The characters are interesting, believable, dynamic, and complex. The fact that it is set in 1962 amid the Cuban Missile Crisis is odd, but it works very well. Best of all is the relationship between the two protagonists who are destined to have a falling out. This film blew me away.  I know there are comic book fans who will hate it because it isn't a copy of the comic book story line. I feel sorry for them. I would much rather have a film like this -- one that is excellent on every level AND that has a NEW story so that it is not predictable to fans like us. Yes, the continuity from the comics is all messed up, but I don't care because this story is so darn good.

B004ZQRJFO|5.0|No need to go into a long tirade on this one to explain why this is good. This is a return to form for Em, he just rips it non-stop on this album and even takes a couple of shots at himself which is commendable and quite funny. Royce doesn't get put on the back burner at all either. He truly holds his own and shines through while flowing with the Em's lyrical onslaughts. Hopefully these guys put out another album together eventually because i'd love to hear more. The only hiccup is the track \\"Lighters\\" even though that's still not a bad track, just kinda stands out among the rest. But bottom line, this is a fantastic album and I don't regret it at all.

081297381X|2.0|What is this book? Some basic skepticism philosophy, some basic math, a lot of cheap shots at people the author dislikes (which is about everyone). Everything is covered well in present day examples for inexperienced (in those fields) readers. But nothing really original here.    The writing style was unique, for the lack of a more complimentary word. At certain points it seems more like a novel or essay than analysis or argument. All the focus-hopping and chest-puffing only interferes with his points coming through. On second thought, without those unnecessary parts, the book should have been at least 2/3 thinner.    Very disappointing. Anyone who understands what the black swan stands for probably already know enough to avoid the book.

For example, properly followed, you'll be eating HEALTHY meats (lean, chicken/turkey...in moderation) and more vegetables than ANY nay-sayer might have you believe.  The concept is simple: (Note: I am a book-reader...not a doctor) Bad, processed, junk carbs and sugars are more easily stored as fat or glycogen. Our bodies are just not equipped to deal with High Fructose Corn Syrups and sugar... so we just tuck it away (and if you're like me...it's tucked in your midsection) If you eliminate that processed stuff, you're left with a body that burns good carbs and (most importantly)it burns FAT. Yucky, nasty, chunky, Fat.<br /><br />This diet teaches portion control, sensible food choices and an array of science based material that makes total sense from a \\"duh, that's common sense\\" standpoint.<br /><br />There is no substitute for hard work, sensible choices and discipline. With this nutrition guide and companion, you'll put all of those hours in the gym to use and have your body working for you.  Give it a try!
0670022411|5.0|I am the first to admit that this book has a very, very, very slow start. I considered putting it down more than once but am so glad that I stuck with it. About 200 pages into the story it became all-consuming. I was reading at work, at home, at red lights... I couldn't put it down! I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of gentle romance stories and a little paranormal fun. But, and this is a HUGE \\"but,\\" this is the first of a trilogy. There is nothing clear about that when you start the book and the ending will leave you feeling very incomplete. I am very happy to have read the story but wish I had learned of it after the books had all been written and released because I am so impatient to see how the tale ends.
076790382X|5.0|[[ASIN:B00199B2Z8 I'm a Stranger Here Myself: Notes on Returning to America After 20 Years Away]] will have you laughing out loud, reading passages to your family, friends, and co-workers, and marveling at these amusing anecdotes reflecting American culture in all of its glorious splendor.<br /><br />  A few years back, I read Bill Bryson's A Walk in the Woods, and found myself laughing so hard I was fighting back tears, so when I saw this book sitting on the shelf at my sister-in-law's house, I was fairly certain that there'd be passages within that would be so hilarious my stomach would hurt from laughing so much.  I must say my assumption was 100% accurate--without any substitutions, exchanges, or refunds.<br /><br />  I read most of [[ASIN:B00199B2Z8 I'm a Stranger Here Myself: Notes on Returning to America After 20 Years Away]] out loud to my husband because laughing together is one of our favorite pastimes.  In retrospect, I probably should have saved certain chapters for when he wasn't driving.  (We made it home safely and in relatively good spirits for such a long car trip.)<br /><br />  Even the introduction revealing how Bill Bryson came to write this series of columns about life in the United States after living elsewhere for twenty years is quite entertaining.  I intend to keep a copy of this book on hand, so I can share my favorite chapters with more of my family and friends.  I don't know that I could pick one favorite, but two of the ones that I have shared with others most often are \\"Your New Computer\\" and \\"Your Tax Form Explained.\\"<br /><br />  I find it ironic and quite fitting that I discovered this book at my sister-in-law and her husband's house when we were there to help them set up their new e-mail accounts.  Both of them help people prepare their taxes, but neither of them is particularly high-tech, computer-savvy.  Fortunately, it took a lot longer than expected for my husband and I to get their new accounts set up, which is why I got to checking out the books on their shelf and came across this gem.<br /><br />  I can definitely see and appreciate Bill Bryson being compared to another fabulous humorist, Dave Barry.he books on their shelf and came across this gem.

B004GUSG4M|4.0|I loved the premise of this new mystery -- that the main character had a type of short-term memory amnesia that essentially erased all experiences every night.  The book is cleverly written from the point of view of the main character, and we only see events through her eyes and through the aid of her journal, which helps her through the twists and turns of her life.  I look forward to more mysteries from Watson!<br /><br />Elisabeth Davis, author/illustrator of [[ASIN:B0053TBZZW Harley, The Throwaway Puppy (A Throwaway Puppy Book)]]

The movie was so inspirational and touching it makes me want to show everyone I know and watch it over and over again. I love her story. I probably wouldn't respond as calm and accepting as she was. She inspires me so much. You should totally see this movie!
0439023521|5.0|This book may be intended for young adults but at almost 40 I found it to be a very good book. It has dark themes and plenty of tragedy, and tough conditions to spare, I think that is why I found myself pulling for the characters that much more. It's because of their desperate situation that you feel more sympathetic and in doing so you get pulled that much further into the story of their lives. It's a good book and I recommend it to anyone except for those who can't handle darker themes and violence, otherwise it's a good and fairly quick read.

B000MGBSI0|4.0|I'm just getting into MP - I was like, 11 when it debuted on FOX. Anyway, Season 2 is full of drama and scary stuff. And there's a lot of people looking out the window on each other. I don't like how some stuff repeats from season 1, like when Alison and that guy are in his hotel room and the champagne spills on them, is just like season one with Billy and Amanda. And then Alison saw Amanda kissing Chas just like she saw Michael kissing Kim in season one! And Amanda's mom appears and they don't get along, just like Jake & his mom.     Billy is much more mature now then in season 1. He's manly and not all goofy. The triangle between Michael x Kimberly x Sydney is dumb... Mancini ain't all that, ok?  It's hilarious how they're all trying to murder each other. And I'm surprised Amanda went into business with Reed after telling Jake that Reed seemed odd to her. She's always bragging about how she's \\"such a good businesswoman\\", yet she didn't trust her instincts. In season 1, Jo seemed tough and street smart, but season 2, she's such a wuss.. Season 1 Jo would've dumped Reed as soon as he  pointed her gun at her.  I really feel for Jane in season II. she seems so nice and is getting the short end of the stick...I was really pulling for her and that lawyer dude...    I am looking forward to watching Season 3! Does Jo have her baby? Will Billy & Alison get married? Will Jake choose Amanda or Jo? Will any romance happen between Billy & Celia?

B0059R5Q08|3.0|The visuals and score are lovely...but the movie plays more like a stage play, with much of the characters inner thoughts made plain in dialog.  I would have preferred less words and more atmosphere created by acting...a la the kiss from Last of the Mohicans.    Absolutely no bodice ripping in this one --in case any one was wondering.
1451629184|5.0|This is a great story of survival in a horrible situation. Some parts are cringe-worthy such as Jaycee's rape scenes so it is not for the squeamish. Jaycee's writing style is very childish so don't expect the best literary work. It is truly in her own words.

0307477479|1.0|When I first started this book, I had high hope and enjoyed the first few \\"chapters.\\" But... as I went along,and finished it,<br /><br />a decision was made. I did NOT like this book. It was a bunch of \\"connected\\" short stories (a genre I am not in love with). I did like a few, Safari, Country Club, Naples. Not that the chapters had those titles. Everything was so disjointed to me. The character the author was referring to in each chapter was kept a mystery until you figured it out. I had neither the time nor the inclination to reread past portions of this book to unravel the characters.I completely skipped the power point chapter just to finish this book and move on to more enjoyable reading. It reminded me of books you were required to read in College and then delve into the true meaning, UGH!! I am done with that. The Pulitzer committee and I do not agree on good literature, that is for sure.

0811875040|1.0|I wonder why I keep receiving e-mail reccommendations from Amazon for this book. I wonder why is Amazon still trying to sell this book,  specially when they have even offered to send a free book to all buyers when the new reprint of the book is done in October .... As everybody knows by now, that the book has many mistakes in it, and there is an errata sheet.  I really do not understand.     I actually felt insulted, as a reader, and cancelled my order with Amazon.co.uk when I read the reply of the writer/owner of Miette to one of the comments here in Amazon, saying something like : We should hire you guys as proofreaders ( I beleive this comment has been deleted by now). I think is not right to make jokes to the readers that have bough this book.    It is such a shame, and I feel so bad about it...but I had to say it...
B000FBJFSC|2.0|I guess it would be a good book if you are okay with the unending misery of hunger and spineless alcoholism.  These books where the wife is so noble and long suffering while the father drinks the money away are so miserable it is hard to read.  I understand in those days, there were not a lot of choices for women with children.  Certainly not divorce in Catholic Ireland at that time.  I'm just saying after the first one hundred pages it gets redundant.
B001ECQ6E2|1.0|I purchased this DVD to show to a small group.  When I tested the DVD, it would not play.  Wound up calling Blockbuster (they didn't have it) and finally located a public library that had it.  Lot of time wasted - and a more wary man in the future...
0553582038|3.0|I am still liking the series in general, but if this had been book 1, I probably would not have read the rest of the series. I have developed an interest in the characters which is deep enough to carry me through the series. I am losing a bit of my enthusiasm, however. As a female, I've read my share of hot and steamy books. I find that Mr. Martin's idea of sex (whether an actual scene or just character attitude towards it) is definitely masculine in temper and quite crude. As an older female, I have watched certain vulgar language creep into literature more and more. It seems Mr. Martin has gotten more vulgar with each book. Most fantasies I read seem to be grounded in a Medieval European culture. Then you add magic, monsters and heroes. I am finding Mr. Martin's modern vulgarity jarring in his Medieval setting. Granted, I am not sure when certain words first appeared in the English language, but they come across as modern language, none the less. As for the story, it is still keeping my interest because I have become vested in the characters. Jaime and his turn around keep me wondering. Cersei's devolving into madness is fascinating. I am looking forward to the last book. I am, however, a bit fearful of it.  I am uncertain how Mr. Martin will pull it all together from this point and provide his readers with a satisfactory ending.    When I originally wrote this review elsewhere, I thought #5 was the last book. Unfortunately it wasn't.

B004EWEX9Y|4.0|Take your movies on the road with you. Even on standard resolution (as opposed to Hd) this cable produces great images on small and medium sized TVs, just remember to download the movies before you go :) I have also tried it with Netflix at home (in the US) and it works really well there too - no need to buy a separate box if you have an iPhone or iPod.
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|Oddly enough, this was a very good movie.  It had good acting, background music, and there is even a bit of a twist which I won't elaborate upon.  My only complaint is that the audio was a bit low no matter how I adjusted the volume.

030746363X|5.0|Tim Ferriss is a nut, it goes without saying.  However, he's a quick and entertaining read, and a lot of his suggestions are amazingly easy and practical, gleaned from his personal experience and from digesting others' experiences.     I followed his low carb diet for 4 months and lost several pounds quite easily.     I am just starting the kettle bells. We'll see how that goes.      I'll withhold comment on the sex stuff he randomly throws in there (shouldn't    that be a different book?! Whatever)    Worth buying the book, for sure.  Motivated me.
B000IOERBG|5.0|I believe that I have now read every book that Harris has written - including the non-fiction. But I haven't liked them all. Unlike most, I didn't care for Fatherland nor did I like Ghost very much. But I loved Enigma, the first of the Cicero books, and Pompeii. I didn't care that much for this book for the first two hundred pages but then the pace accelerated and it became gripping.<br /><br />Reading through the other reviews I see that the native Russians were offended by the unflattering depiction of Russia. Sorry, but it seemed entirely plausible to me. I found that even though I was reding it in August, I kept piling on layers of clothing to fight the cold.<br /><br />It's a real page turner. It takes a little while for it to build momentum but then it just grabs you and carries you through to the end.
B001E45XT4|5.0|These headphones work great, and mic too. I use it for playing WoW and Ventrilo, and everyone says how great I sound, the noise cancelling does a wonderful job. Plus the earphone sound quality is superb! for a $25 unit, there is no better, it works like a $75 unit. Super comfortable and really eliminates outside noise well. IF you have a super large head, the tightness will take getting use to, but you will, and be thankful for it in the long run. Even the wires are high quality, and thick/sturdy. Volume control and mic mute button work extremely well too. If you are looking for ultra deep base, you will not find it at this price point, but these Plantronics do a good job considering. Do not hesitate to buy!! Enjoy

0062060554|4.0|It was different, I read it but didn't enjoy it as much as other books I have. It is strange to me that amnesiacs are able to remember how to write etc without having recall of events. My clinical friends assure me they do but it is still somewhat of a mystery.  I thought the book was exciting near the end, I found the ending to be somewhat predictable. It was a summer read. I bought this item at Amazon.
B0033AGPF8|5.0|I received this album in a very short time with standard shipping. Amazon LP boxes are the best way to ship these delicate discs. The sound quality is phenomenal when compared to CD. Digital processing leaves out the natural quality, which is obvious if you see my LP collection versus my CD collection, and Im only 24. Its not an original Reprise pressing from 1967, but good luck finding one in pristine condition for a reasonable price. I played this album on a $140 CD/Tape/Turntable unit, and a $1,000 Technics rack system, not much difference in sound despite higher grade EQ. If you love Hendrix, I highly recommend going vinyl.
0307386171|4.0|The book topics seems an unlikely one. A marriage goes bad on one bad wedding night. The book illumines love gone wrong, the way that distorted ideas about sexuality (both his and hers in this case) can harm a marriage. Well worth the read, especially for couples preparing for marriage.
B0051MKMNC|5.0|I have never written a review, just had to for this movie, that's how good this movie is. Bradley Cooper is one of those great character actors, and he doesn't even look like Ernest Borgnine or Paul Giamatti. Honestly don't understand why he isn't a bigger star with more leading roles. Anyways great story, great production value. Get it now you won't regret it.
0439023491|3.0|Repetitive, predictable, and emotionally manipulative, plus the author had to stretch the protagonist's ignorance, idiocy, and irrationality to the breaking point in order to maintain tension and mystery. Otherwise, reasonably good. (Copied from my Goodreads review)
B004WOS7LO|5.0|Can't get enough listening to David Cook's new album This Loud Morning!  Come on people, give this album a chance.
B0034G4OUY|4.0|This turned out to be a little surprising.  The first 5 or 10 minutes kind of confirm that this is going to be an exploitation movie, a straight revenge movie that could have been from the 80's, or something from Tarantino's list of obscure movies to watch.  However it turns out to be something not quite as straightforward, in no small part due to some terrific turns from the two main leads.    Dwayne Johnson plays his best role in years here, as the guy just released from prison, who sets out at a brisk no-nonsense pace, to settle some scores.  The why he was in, the who he is after part gradually come together during the course of the movie, with a few flashbacks, along with some surprisingly well played backstories to the other characters in the movie.  While \\"The Rock\\" is playing his best - and perhaps not coincidentally his least verbose - role in years, Billy Bob Thornton also puts in a reliable turn as the cop on his case, who also has his own tortured background.    If there's a misfire, it's the plot strand of the hitman hired to kill Johnson.  It's just not too essential to the story, although it does lead to the only brief car chase in the movie.   I should point out this is no \\"Fast 5\\" clone of babes and car chases - neither are in particular abundance here... the only thing it has in common is that the camera lavishes some enviable screen time on the muscle cars, and the rumble of Johnson's Chevelle SS acts as more of a voice for The Rock's character than he does.  Clint Mansell's score of tinkling piano's mixed with some pounding synths as the behemoth Johnson ploughs towards his mark, is effectively backed up with some surprising song additions on the soundtrack.. from Iggy Pop to Kenny Rogers.  All in all, it's a surprisingly stylishly put together flick - which while not the most surprising in the world, certainly is lifted by style and performances to the front of the pack of this ilk currently doing the rounds.  With the characters named by what they do or what they are (\\"Driver\\", \\"Cop\\", \\"Killer\\"), the emphasis on style and the music, the imperfect characters, one is almost tempted to see some homage to A Leone Western here - but in a good way.  You may see the end coming, it might trod a well worn path, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and think it's better than its current competitors.  Thumbs up.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|As many others, I followed Bethany's story in the newspapers and was interested in watching more of her story.  I was curious as to how you even begin to grasp being able to do just do the simple things, like put your hair in a ponytail, hook your bikini top, slice a tomato....you know, the normal things that you take for granted, until you aren't able to do those things without a huge undertaking.  Bethany's attack by the shark while out surfing with friends is very close to the beginning of the movie, so much of the movie his how she has doubts, how it isn't easy and though she is determined, how she isn't sure she will be able to come back to surf at all, much less compete.      Before I read other comments I would not have felt that this movie was overly religious or preachy.  Yes she is in a youth ministry, and like most of us, wonders why obstacles are put in her place or why bad things happen to good people.  For many, faith, whether in one's self, God, or a higher power gets people through, I certainly don't have a problem with the few times that she mentioned her faith.  It didn't detract from the movie for me or make me feel that anything was being pushed at me.     This is a good movie that aside from the shark attack, where it would be too scary for small kids, shows kids (all ages) that you can achieve if you set your mind to it, are willing to put everything into it and have faith in yourself.     Overall an excellent movie with real shots of Bethany and her amazing family at the end.  What a great story!
B004HW7JMY|2.0|The two stars is for the price (I know, know...), but hey - I love this series but don't have 35 bucks to spend on just six episodes.  Please lower the price Amazon and then you'll have a sale.
0345529057|3.0|I was enchanted by the HBO series and wanted to read the whole thing. But maybe I should not have bought the four book set.  I have to say (along with everyone else) that I loved the first three books. I couldn't put them down.  By Book 4 (A Feast for Crows) however, I began to feel like I'd fallen for a \\"bait and switch\\" scam.   Too many cliff hangers, too little character development. And my favorite character, Tyrion, is neglected. I finally started skipping some chapters entirely. How many times do I want to hear the same things again and again? I got tired of the endless back story that was inserted--all too regularly--into nearly every chapter. It's as though GRRM wanted to make each book accessible on its own to a new reader who hadn't read the previous books.  This makes book 4 no fun at all.  Not to mention all the subplots and side stories that distract from the major developments.  It's ok to ask the reader to suspend judgment from time to time, but enough is enough.     GRRM needs to put us all out of our misery and finish this series.  I'm not even going to bother with Book 5 and will wait and see if HBO does a better job of doing the project more quickly and succinctly--before all the actors get too old and die.      Read Books 1-3 and enjoy them, but don't expect the satisfaction to continue or the story to be done.     Maybe I'll read the final book when it comes out, but as a reader I feel that the author has broken his pact with the audience--to (as others have said) \\"move the story along.\\"    Too bad.

0061885452|5.0|This book, or rather life tale is the most honest, lovely and heartfelt story I have ever had the pleasure of reading. I have read a lot of memoirs/autobiographies but non have sucked me into the writers life quite like this one. I have always loved Craig Ferguson and I watch his show every night so the moment I heard about this book I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. The first time I read it in less than 24 hours and every time I go back to it now it doesn't take me much longer. Ferguson presents a brutally honest picture of what his life has been thus far and his tales as a young boy in Glasgow to his life now in Hollywood. From his early days as a young man who wanted to become and American, to his struggles with addiction Craig Ferguson takes us with him every step of the way wearing his heart on his sleeve. And with all that he gives me my favorite book and a man I truly respect now more than ever. This must read page turner will make you laugh and cry all at the same time. I am currently reading it for the fourth time..and I'm certain there will be many more times to come. Can't wait!
B004XWMXX8|4.0|hi, i bought this cd for my daughter, because she was begging and begging for it, and i don't love selena gomez's music, but as we were driving home i stopped to drop something off and we i got back, olivia(my daughter) said lets listen to some music and she pressed the cd button and smiled at me, and then we listened to the first song; bang bang bang, which i sort of liked, and when we got home we had lisned to the entire cd and i liked it
0553801473|5.0|This is an excellent series. I started with Game of Thrones and continued, my only wish, is that we are not kept waiting for 5 years for the next book in this series and there will be another book. Well worth reading and enjoying, I will share it with other friends and family when the are ready to read. Treat yourself and buy this. Amazon has a good price for it, especially since it is hard back, not paper back.
B0050KEVO6|4.0|Entertaining and interesting game. Not nearly as crippled from the pay version as people say. Ads are unobtrusive. Does get a bit difficult as time goes on. Particularly when you know something is in the game and the combination that you thinks makes the most sense for it doesn&apos;t work. Particularly frustrating when the combination that does work seems like utter nonsense. Still a fun a thought provoking game though.
0439023521|5.0|My nephew recommended this to me and I thought it might be too kiddy for me. One of my best friends here at college recommended it a few weeks later and I gave it a shot. It was definitely one of the best things I have read this year. I read through this book in a couple days. Instantly picked up the sequels, Catching Fire and Mockingjay and spent a day each on those.<br /><br />These books are addictive and well-written. I would recommend it to anybody.
B000GW8OAK|4.0|good movie nothing much to say that other reviews have not said shipped and rec on time would buy again.
0765318741|4.0|Usually when I hear people say \\"The book is not like the movie\\" I will typically find more similarities between the two rather than differences. This is certainly not the case with 'I am Legend' - the two really couldn't be much more different.<br /><br />Many people seem to be coming to this book after watching the movie. I actually enjoyed the movie (somewhat). I found it to be a good evening out with the Miss's back when it was on the silver screen -- average Hollywood blockbuster fare. Knowing that books are typically better than their movie counterparts I was excited to dig into the book version. Overall I do like the book better, but it's not without its flaws.<br /><br />It is interesting to see Will Smith on the cover with a backdrop of New York City behind him - in the book Robert Neville looks nothing like Will and it takes place in Los Angeles.<br /><br />About the book -<br /><br />I'm not into vampires AT ALL. I have almost zero interest in stories involving them, so I was a little dismayed when I found that they populate this novel. Thankfully at least they aren't the super charismatic, overly powerful, teenie-bopper vampires that populate many of the stories today. In 'I am Legend' they are more animalistic, though the anti-garlic, anti-cross, anti-sunlight clich&eacute;s are present. I was able to get over this.<br /><br />Robert Neville is seemingly the only known human to have escaped an outbreak which is turning both the dead and the living into vampires. Robert is just a typical human being who is suffering loneliness in an abhorred world. Robert spends many hours a day ensuring that he lives to see the next day. He is constantly setting up strings of garlic, building stakes, fixing boarded up windows, etc. Eventually he becomes fed up and he tries to solve the mysteries of vampirism. Why can't they go out in the sun? Why is garlic such a good deterrent?<br /><br />Really, this story is more about a man's loneliness, the vampires and such are more in the background. I found that this book touched on the loneliness aspect far better than the movie.<br /><br />Here are some of the things I enjoyed about the book -<br />I found the writing to be quite excellent. Also, finally I now understand what \\"I am Legend\\" really means - something the movie never really addresses. I like how in the book Robert is just a typical man with his own problems, such as alcoholism. Even though it did feel a little abrupt, I did like how the story ended, it's one of those books you reflect on for awhile after setting it down.<br /><br />But, there are some flaws -<br />In some instances the scenes didn't really flow together very well. For instance, there is a whole scene involving Robert's interaction with a dog. Matheson doesn't really weave this scene in very well; the story just sort of comes to a halt as we read about this interaction for a number of pages. This element would of had more impact had it weaved with the underlying story a bit better, to me it felt really tacked-on. I found the science in this book way far-fetched and there are a few too many pages dedicated to this. Also, Matheson's idea of living and dead vampires felt as though it was an idea that really never fleshed out fully. It does come into play at the end, but it could have been done a bit better.<br /><br />Overall, 'I am Legend' is greater than the sum of its parts. Despite its flaws I enjoyed it quite a bit.<br /><br />Also worth noting, only half of this book is dedicated to the story 'I am Legend', the other half of the book contains various other non-related short stories that range from about 3 to 20 pages. Some of these are decent, but I had no idea this was a book of short stories, so I was a little disappointed to find that out, especially since it is not mentioned anywhere on the cover. I have read comments for other reviews that say \\"Well, you're getting more than you paid for!\\" but I don't quite see it that way - to me it would be like expecting a full-length movie, only for the movie to wrap up 40 minutes in, and the remaining 40 minutes to be below average to average short 'Tales from the Crypt' clips.<br /><br />In the end, I give 'I am Legend' a solid 4, and I collectively give the remaining stories about a 3. Overall this book is around a 3.5, but rounded to 4.minutes to be below average to average short 'Tales from the Crypt' clips.    In the end, I give 'I am Legend' a solid 4, and I collectively give the remaining stories about a 3. Overall this book is around a 3.5, but rounded to 4.
0345529057|5.0|Read all 4 books and never had a single problem with pages ripping out, binding tearing or anything of that matter. The story was pretty incredible as well. We all know that certain deaths may upset us, but please try and refrain from tossing your book across the room or tearing the pages out.
B0050PYNP8|1.0|My husband and I are huge fans of the two British actors who star in this movie. In fact Shaun of the Dead is one of our all-time favorite movies! Since We weren't able to make it to the theater to see Paul, I pre-ordered my copy of Paul several months ago expecting it to be as funny and entertaining as Shaun of the Dead. Imagine my shock and disgust when barely thirty minutes into this movie they start the Christian Bashing, which I must add was a constant theme in this movie. Not only was it completely insulting it was completely unnecessary. I am a Christian and to have my faith used as fodder for a movie in order to gain a few laughs by painting us as radical dim-witted fools is way, WAY over the line.     I love alien movies! I love sci-fi movies! I don't know if aliens really exist, but its fun to imagine it. Would I give up my faith and morals if an alien knocked on my door? Absolutely not. But, that is exactly what ruth does the second she sees Paul. she gives up her faith and starts using language that would make a sailor blush and starts looking forward to all the sin and fornicating she can do now that she's discovered there is no God and she won't be punished for her sins.    The movie would have been completely awesome if they would have left the Christian bashing out of it. It totally ruined the movie for me and is making me re-think seeing another movie created by these \\"entertainers\\". I guess what really ticks me off is that Christians are expected to be tolerant of other religions and lifestyles, but other religions and lifestyles are not tolerant of us. If a movie was made and \\"bashed\\" other faiths, Jewish, Muslim, etc. this movie would NEVER had been made.     I wish the \\"entertainment\\" industry would show us the same respect and consideration for our beliefs when making a film as they show other religions.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Most people say they won't see FWB because it is the same thing as NSA, but truthfully only the idea is the same. I have seen both movies and FWB is my favorite by far, it has more life issues in it and i feel like justin and mila have GREAT chemistry together. The movie has tons of laughs, emotional parts, and also tons of cute parts. This movie is one of my favorites and should definatly be seen whether you liked or didn't like NSA, since they are two completely different films.
1594202710|5.0|Have not had the time to get very deep into the book since I received it, but can say that what I have read so far is very impressive in terms of historical scope, insights into the essential nature of Chinese culture, and, best of all, superb writing and use of language. I would highly recommend this book to anyone seriously interested in understanding China and its uniqueness as a nation.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Great for adults, though doesn't hold the attention of children as well.  Still the best movie from Pixar yet.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|For me the best parts of this book were at the beginning and the end, providing some context for the anecdotes, vignettes, and opinions in between. If I'd had the option I would have given 3.5 stars because much is very enjoyable about the book. The difficulty throughout is lack of integration, which may be the project, but also may be the person. How does a woman who prefers self-deprecating humor and has a desire to be liked rise to the top of a very competitive profession? I still don't know but am curious.   Overall a fun if uneven read.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Was so happy to find this movie as it is my two year old grandson's \\"new\\" favorite movie.  It was like brand new condition and has already been watched at least 25 times!  The price was an extra bonus.
B005BW1IEE|5.0|I feel that this album is what 3 Doors Down is really all about. They have combined the sound and feel of their previous albums into Time of My Life. IMHO this easily feels like the bands sweet spot combining the fierceness of their first effort with the thoughtfull reflection and soul of the second and third and the humbleness of the 4th album specifically the track Citizen Soldier which has a place in my heart as I am one of those citizen soldiers. I can't wait to hear what else 3 Doors Down has instore for us. ROCK ON 3 DOORS DOWN! Highly recommended(in case there was any confusion)!
0670022411|5.0|Seldom do I read a book whose characters are so compelling and finely wrought that I actually feel a keen sense of loss when the story concludes. \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" is such a book. Witches, vampires, daemons notwithstanding, this book is really about discovering who you are and your place in the world, family in all its glorious incarnations, being able to make difficult decisions and accept their consequences, tolerating those who are different than ourselves (and even learning to like them), and yes...MAGIC.<br /><br />Magic is brilliantly woven throughout what is, at heart, a romance between a reluctant young witch, Diana, and the much older vampire who loves her, Matthew. Along the way, the author Deborah Harkness introduces some clever new concepts about the creatures that co-exist with humans. For example, who knew that vampires not only enjoy great wine but are also yoga enthusiasts? Or that daemons are either creative geniuses or serial killers (or both)? The book also contains history lessons (of sorts), but of the painless variety.<br /><br />I did become somewhat impatient with the semi-chaste love scenes, but that is a minor fault I'm more than willing to overlook. At nearly 600 pages, the book was still far too short. I felt that I had met a wonderful group of new friends, and I was unwilling to let them go. I hope the author is even now busy working on a sequel that I, for one, cannot wait to read.
B000E5N6LG|5.0|I really like Kevin Costner and thought that he was really good in this movie and so was Dennis Quaid.  It had a surprise ending that I liked. I will be watching this more than once.  I received this item in great condiiton and very quickly.
B0050PYNOY|4.0|A disappointing box office return may find the destiny of Your Highness as being a future cult classic, which is somewhat disappointing in itself considering that it's a hilarious blast for its whole running time.  Pineapple Express director David Gordon Green re-unites with co-stars Danny McBride and James Franco, as they play a pair of princes that embark on a quest to save Franco's wife to be (Zooey Daschenel) from an evil wizard (Justin Theroux).  Along the way they come across a series of hilariously violent misadventures, as well as team up with a gorgeous warrior (Natalie Portman).  I don't want to say much else about the film, for fear that it will spoil the ridiculously funny exploits that unfold throughout.  Granted that Your Highness is definitely not something for everyone, but for what it's worth, this film is a hoot.  All in all, leave your brain and inhibitions at the door for Your Highness, and you'll have a smoke-filled blast the whole way through.
B00012QLQ4|5.0|It is difficult to believe that this Japanese anime classic from Katsuhiro Ôtomo is now more than 20 years old. The graphics remain stunning, the musical soundtrack fresh and the story line massive in sweep; the only real sign of its age being its immense 2-hour running time. This release is a beautiful restoration of the original print (almost all copies of which have either been lost, worn out or else are firmly in the hands of collectors) with vibrant colour, crisp visuals and an excellent remastered musical soundtrack.  True to its manga origins, the film is intense and action-packed (as well as graphically violent and gory). It is also frenetic in pace -- especially as it tries to condense an original manga story that appeared in weekly serialised form over an 8 year period; even in simplified form, with a reduced array of characters, the story is often hard to follow. The 2001 English language dub that features in this release tries to capture some of the energy of the Japanese and as such is perhaps the weakest element in this release; for preference, I would recommend viewing in Japanese, with subtitles.<br /><br />Even if you're not a fan of manga or anime, this release is well worth a viewing, both as a cult classic and as enormously influential cyberpunk masterpiece years ahead of its time.
1932100660|5.0|Finally, a book with factual information by credentialed and respected sources validating the choices made by vegans and vegetarians worldwide.  The information contained in these pages is invaluable. In a perfect world, this book would be required reading in medical schools. Personally, I am grateful to the authors and researchers for information to back up my food choices when questioned by people (especially family!) about why I choose to avoid animal products. This book is a life saver, and I recommend it to anyone who cares about personal health, family health, and the health of the planet!
B004XWLN20|5.0|There are very few movies or TV shows I watch more than once but now that I am almost finished with the 218 episodes of Smallville, I do plan on watching them all again, maybe next summer, if I can wait that long.<br /><br />As a kid and teenager, I used to buy all the Superman/Superboy/Supergirl/Batman, etc. comic books I could get my hands on, so I am pretty familiar with the story of Superboy and Superman. The comics are a bit different than what Smallville has come up with, but I love the way this was handled.<br /><br />It is exciting and fun to watch Clark Kent discovering his powers one by one and becoming the highly moral, selfless hero that Superman is. I like that he has his parents and friends all there to support and help him when he isn't saving them. It is also quite funny to see all the inside jokes and references to other Superman TV shows or comics. I find it funny also that Clark Kent is afraid to fly even now that I am halfway into season 10.<br /><br />I approve of the way Clark Kent dresses now that he is practicing as being a hero. I always cringed to see Superman wearing those tights and briefs with the cape. That red, blue and yellow costume looks ridiculous. Clark dresses in darker colors with the big S on his chest. So far I have not actually understood what the S is supposed to stand for. It is his family symbol from Krypton, but why an S?<br /><br />I have found many things I can criticize over the 10 seasons, but not enough to make me stop watching this show. I don't like that the genres are always getting mixed together. In one episode, Lana Lang becomes a vampire. That was almost enough to make me say \\"forget it!\\" but luckily, that didn't last. I also think it is a bit strange that Clark is always being told how he is supposed to be the greatest savior this world has ever known. That seems to be putting him on an equal footing with spiritual masters and it doesn't make any sense because there are so many other people in this series with super powers including a bunch of Kryptonians at some point. For a guy who is supposedly almost invulnerable, he is constantly getting the (bleep) kicked out of him. I also didn't care for the season where Lana Lang moves in with Lex Luther and then marries him. It made me not like her although she wasn't evil, she was protecting Clark.<br /><br />Tom Welling is about the perfect actor to play Clark Kent/Superman. He has the looks and the build. Besides being good looking, he can be the good boy, Clark and the bad boy, Dark Clark (when he is affected by Red Kryptonite). He does a convincing job either way.<br /><br />The funny thing is that I never watched this show the whole time it was running, but as soon as it ended, I got hooked! I am glad I waited until it was on DVD because it is such a pleasure to watch all of the episodes without any commercials or TV icons on the screen as we see with TV shows all the time now. Also, it would have driven me nuts to have to wait from the season cliffhangers to the next season.h of Kryptonians at some point.

B004H1V5RU|4.0|I thought the perplexus balls looked awesome. I honestly chose the Epic from all of them because I liked the colors - I thought the cool ice blue and white would also make me look cool. But you wont look so cool when you go crying to your mom after trying to solve this thing. Its fairly difficult, I got to level 25 so far out of about 100. Its not impossible but its tricky, some tracks have no ledge on one side, the ball can easily fall off.

B000FVE3A2|5.0|This watch is built like a tank, runs like a top, and gets attention everywhere I go.  This is my second Invicta watch.  I like the big watches because I'm 6'5\\" and 300lbs.  If you're slight in stature, you should consider a smaller watch lest you look like a watch wearing version of Flavor Flav .  This thing is absolutely huge and I love it.  It's my first \\"automatic watch\\", which I think I'd reconsider if buying again.  Prior to purchase I thought \\"Wow, no batteries, no issues\\".  But when the watch sits unworn for a day it stops.  Now I think it's more annoying to have to keep the watch on a \\"winding\\" machine.  I'd take my batteries back if I could.<br /><br />Other than that, great watch and I'd totally recommend it.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I've worn this watch almost every day now for 2 years and I still love it.  It has never had a problem (knock wood), I still get compliments on it, and it goes with everything.  It's the best watch I've ever had.  I've also worn it scuba diving to almost 100'.<br /><br />If you held a gun to my head and made me complain, here's what I'd offer up.  It's not the most accurate watch I've ever had.  About once a month, I adjust the time about two or three minutes.  I usually take this opportunity to reset the date if that's off (always goes to 31 days which throws the date off on 30 day months).  Also, the glass is not protected by the bezel, so I've scratched the glass a little bit.<br /><br />Frankly, I like this watch so much, I'm probably going to buy another one to keep in storage in case they discontinue or change this existing one.
B004XGWPXC|3.0|It's 1988 and Dexter Mayhew and Emma Morley have only just met. But after only one day together, they cannot stop thinking about one another. Over twenty years, snapshots of that relationship are revealed on the same day--July 15th--of each year. Dex and Em face squabbles and fights, hopes and missed opportunities,  laughter and tears. And as the true meaning of this one crucial day is revealed, they must come to grips with the nature of love and life itself.     My review:  I read this book because the movie is coming out on August 19, and being pop-culture-ignorant as I am, I thought I'd at least read the book so I'd have a clue. Well. I should have known better.    One Day gives a snapshot of Dex and Emma's lives, sometimes separately, sometimes together, every year on July 15 for 20 years. We watch Emma through the ups and downs of her life, and we watch Dex destroy his life with a boatload of bad choices. It is a good book, and I enjoyed reading it, for the most part. I mostly kept reading to find out if they finally got together. Of course, I'm not going to tell you what happened. I will tell you to grab a box of tissues. That's the only thing that messed up this book for me. You know I hate to cry when I'm reading.

0553801473|1.0|I was a fan of the books...after this one there is no way I will read another book in this series.  Only 1 or 2 characters are still alive that are worth reading about...I found myself reading the beginning and end of chapters for the first time because the middle of each chapter is fill with nonsense history not relevant to any of what is actually going on. Killing characters is ok if it makes sense to story progression but the death in this book is just stupid...lets just Julius Caesar him and get on with it. So, George RR Martin you lost a fan today...and u cannot make it right in my eyes, so goodbye Song of Ice and Fire.
B000005HLV|5.0|This album introduced me to Black Metal and I admit, while I was always a fan of trash metal, the biggest reason why I got interested in this band is because of the infamous circumstances  surrounding the vocalist \\"Dead\\"...who kills himself and dies....and guitarist \\"Euronymous\\" who was murdered. The story is pretty well known, so I'm just gonna get into the music.<br /><br />The music itself isn't all that complex or catchy, but what it lacks in those aspects it makes up big time in sheer cold, evil atmosphere and originality. The music isn't super loud or violent, The images I get when listening to this album aren't ones of bloody chainsaw murders or loud possessed demonic vocals, but I do get a feeling of distant, frigid, true disdain of all existence. I get images of long lonely rainy nights near big gothic satanic churches and foggy grey forests with thunder strikes and a huge moon in the distance and maybe vampires and werewolfs and other nasty creatures lurking near by.<br /><br />This is due in part to the gritty production of the album. The Guitars sound very thick and drone..y and almost electronic like, and the drums sound like distant rolling thunder and are tribal like. Speaking of drums, Hellhammer is very creative and refreshing for a metal drummer. He's always coming up with neat fills and has his own style and unlike a lot of other metal drummers, instead of pounding away as fast as he possibly can, he's in control and either speeds up or slows down as best to fit the music. Make no mistake about it though, this guy can reach 300 BPM and match 1349's drummer if he feels like it, as proven in later albums.<br /><br />Bass...is there not to make the guitar sound weird and awkward..just like every other metal band. There is a sweet bass riff in Life eternal though.<br /><br />What the album get's most flak on are the vocals, the singing. It's not growling or screeching, it's opera like. I don't mind them, and make the album stand out even more in my opinion. But they may not be your cup of tea.<br /><br />My 2 favorite tracks on this album are the first 2, Funeral Fog, and Freezing Moon. Those 2 do a good job of introducing the sound and overall atmosphere of the album. Freezing Moon has a SICK solo in it. If you do consider yourself a huge metal head and don't have this masterpiece yet, stop doing that, and go get your filthy hands on this NOW. It will be worth it.cup of tea.

1153737566|4.0|Vanity Fair is alive after two centuries, readable despite its great length, because Thackeray so entertainingly skewers the moral foibles of early 19th Century British society - the fawning, the greed, the hypocrisy, the pack mentality, the cowardice. It is reassuring to the misanthrope in us that nothing has changed about human nature since the time of Napoleon.     Above all of its qualities, two things stand out about Vanity Fair: Becky Sharp, one of the most compelling characters in English literature, and the ironic narrative tone in which the tale is told.    First, Becky: If you were to catalog her sins, Thackeray's \\"little adventuress,\\" would rank with some of fiction's worst villains, nearly on a par with Shakespeare's Iago or Dickens's Uriah Heep. Why, then, does the reader find himself rooting for her? Because Becky is resourceful, cynically self-aware and always in the middle of the action. Also because Becky is a lot like ... not like us, of course, but a lot like certain people we know: willing to cut an ethical corner or undercut a friend if it will work to their advantage and there's a decent chance they won't get caught. Part of Becky's fascination is that despite her relentlessly me-first attitude, she is the farthest thing from a narcissist. While a narcissist can only see what's in the mirror, Becky is a gifted observer of others, which makes her a brilliant mimic and con artist, able to locate the hidden soft spots where her victims are vulnerable to flattery or more elaborate forms of deceit.    Second, the tone: The genius of Vanity Fair's comedy is the pretense that the reader is in the hands of a reporter who has no axe to grind and no particular preference for one character over another. In fact, the narrator is loading the dice at every throw and humorously signaling when he should be taken at face value and when he means exactly the opposite of what he's saying. Vanity Fair is a long book, in the tradition of the three-volume novel thenin vogue. What helps make the book glide by is that the narrator is such urbane good company. He's a bit like the legendary director Alfred Hitchcock, who used to sign off from his 1950s crime-and-suspense show by noting, in a nod to American TV's then-prevailing morality standards, that the criminal in today's episode ultimately was brought to justice. He would deliver this news with a face so sour and a tone so arch that the viewer fully understood that Hitchcock's sympathies lay more with the wily villains than with their insipid victims.    An extra bonus is some of the greatest character names this side of Dickens: Lady Jane Sheepshanks, Fanny de Butterbrod, Lord Tapeworm, Lady Bareacres, Ensign Stubble and the Rev. Beilby Binny, to name a few.
B0025UHKNS|2.0|I bought my watch in Oct/Nov of 2010 and things went great at first.  Garmin sent out a software update in March/April of 2011 and things went downhill fast!      There is a major flaw in this software that prevents the battery from recognizing its charge level.  It can charge all night and say 100% but as soon as you try to take it out for a run it starts beeping that the battery is low and it will start resetting itself.  I've gone through the forums and there are a LOT of people out there having this problem.  A reasonable person might think that Garmin support would step up and get a fix going, nope.  Support from Garmin is virtually nonexistant!  There are people on the forums that have managed to find fixes by calling in and working their way through, and they have been good enough to post what has worked for them.  I've tried it all, even going so far as to take the watch apart to manually remove the battery hoping it will reset it.  It worked...for a couple of months.  Finally I am sending it back to Garmin to be replaced.  An important point: Garmin has to be aware that the update they sent out has created this problem, they have even told people to go back to the last working version while support plods along with the next update(no release date on that yet 5 months later.)  However, if these temporary fixes don't work and you bought the watch more than 1 yr ago, Garmin will charge $110 and at least 2 weeks to replace yours with one that isn't messed up.  That's right, they are going to charge you to fix what they broke!    Overall, the watch is great when it works but should anything go wrong, you are on your own.  Garmin offers no real support.  For the money I paid for my watch, I expect more from Garmin.  For my next purchase I will definately be looking around at my other options because Garmin has been nothing but a headache.  So, if Garmin support was better I'd say definately get this watch but it isn't so I wouldn't risk it.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I preordered this case immediately after seeing it earlier in the year previewed on a gaming website.  It was due to be released in April, which was perfect timing for my vacation. I figured I'd take it with me and use my XBOX360 on down time. Well, it got delayed, so I didn't get it in time. I almost cancelled it, but decided to give it a try anyway.   Even after I got it I almost returned it because the monitor kept cutting out randomly.  I traced it to a faulty HDMI cable that came with the G155. I switched it out, and noticed a huge improvement in Picture quality right away.  I know other reviewers and even GAEMS themselves list it as a 720 max resolution, but after I got the new cable I switched my 360 over to 1080p, the monitor picked it right up, the display even reads 1080p on it.   Just as a test, I hooked up my Archos 43 (It has HDMI out) to it, it worked like a charm.     Pros:   Great picture!  Screen size is really nice. 15.5\\" sounds small, but once you use it you'll realize it actually a very decent size for gaming since you'll be sitting fairly close to it.  It's very convenient to play the 360 (or PS3) anywhere, leaving the TV for others to enjoy.  Speakers are loud, and there are 2 headphone jacks.  Self contained - everything you need for solo gaming goes right in the case.  Well designed, easy to hook up and be gaming in about 3 minutes    There are a few cons:  It's a little heavy, about 10 lbs.   You need to look at it pretty squarely or the picture seems dark, and the angle of the monitor isn't adjustable.  No remote included!! It was supposed to come with one, but for some reason they pulled it out. It has hard to push buttons, so a remote would've been really nice.  Crappy HDMI cable included; I bought  a new one from Amazon, It's only about $5 for a decent 1.5 ft cable.    I really am happy I ordered this, It's a great piece of gear. I intend to take it on my next business trip, it'll be nice to watch DVD's, netflix, espn and play games on the road. I'll even load up my Archos with movies, and plug that into it for a nice 15.5 inch screen to watch them on!    I've used my PS3 and Xbox360 with the G155 and noticed 2 things:     First, my Xbox360 seems to have a better picture than the PS3 on the G155 screen. Not sure why, but it seems brighter and Crisper.   Second, the PS3 fits the case better, it seems like a natural fit. There's also more room for storage because there's no Power Brick like the 360 has.   I have absolutely NO major complaints about this case, It's awesome. I'm going to buy another one so I have a case for each system.    Hope this review helps someone make a great purchase.      Update: Sorry if I confused anyone about the 1080P resolution, but here's the word according to Gaems themselves: Even though the G155 recognizes the 1080P signal and displays it as 1080P, It downscales the picture to 720P. Personally, I think the picture is fantastic, better than my 720P TV, but that could be relative to picture size. And like most people have noted, you really can't tell the difference on a 16\\" screen anyway.
B004X80HEE|5.0|I don't think I have to delve into how touchy the subject matter is in this film . Without a doubt, anyone who finds the idea of brotherly love freaks them out will absolutely hate this film sight unseen. I am not one such viewer. I can take fiction for what it is. That is how you'll take this film if you enjoyed it. Others will be discontent that it did not delve deeper into the boys' relationship--which it could have, address issues of incest vs. the world at large--which it did not, or display any great character growth--which it certainly didn't do.<br /><br />As a matter of fact the conflict in this film is very much glossed over. The mother, and more so the father, have very real insight into the potential of the changing relationship when the brothers are still boys. However, a direct confrontation never comes to fruition for reasons I will not mention here. I don't want to spoil the movie for those who have not seen it.<br /><br /> The only challenge for them is brought about when the youngest brother is offered a chance to train for the Olympics in another country for three years. The older brother flounders; distraught and loss and lonely without the younger brother who has never left his side. Some would argue--which is their prerogative--that the older boy somehow manipulated his sibling into 'loving' him in a manner which many would see as perverted. I think that the director/writer successfully put that suspicion to rest by featuring the first intimacy between the brothers when they are both well and truly grown. I saw no signs of manipulations from the older boy over his younger brother.<br /><br />The acting was superb, the shooting of the film very artistic. The overall feel of the film was positive and happy. I very much enjoyed that the brothers were not depressed and hidden in darkness for the majority of the film. It would have been so easy to have the young men accidentally discovered in bed, to have their private relationship raked through the coals and dissected by family--to have them disowned and rejected by society. I'm glad that the film did not go that route. I've watched a enough gay romance movies with twisted and hopeless endings.<br /><br />They did not come to resent one another, or be fearful of their love and relationship. This movie was aptly named. They stayed true to each other from beginning to end.y family--to have them disowned and rejected by society. I'm glad that the film did not go that route.

B000AOA2G8|5.0|This spanner/crank tool worked great for me; no problems in getting the nuts off. However, it is a bicycle tool (very thin), which means it will slip off the nut when you apply pressure. So, I bought two over-sized washers and a rubber spacer, applied those against the spanner tool, secured the whole jig with a nut screwed on the crank, and the jig prevented the thin spanner tool from slipping off the nut no matter the pressure applied. In my case, once my jig was secured, the nut came off easily.

B004ZZS4CC|3.0|It is not as good as how it was rated on Amazon. Jaycee basically had no life for 18 years. So what she could shared was just her twisted concepts and emotions. I think the American readers like it just because of sentimental reason. Talking about the book itself, it is not a good one.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|I have it on good authority that this is an accurate account of how the economic meltdown occurred in 2008. You do not want to miss this documentary.

0553386794|5.0|With over 2000 reviews for readers to peruse I will make this short; this is NOT sci-fi as I know it, nor even \\"fantasy\\" in the strictest sense. It is alternate mythology based on the various myth cycles we are all very familiar with, especially those in cultural studies, history, and anthropology. That said, for me, this is a huge asset, not a negative at all. Martin must be, in his research if not prior writings, all three of these categories, he simply knows his history TOO well not to be creating a wonderful, parallel version of mostly Western history that has all the blood and passion and irony usually MISSING from bloated bio-fic or dry academic studies in these areas. Add to that his truly fine grasp of a narrative, the ability to breath believable dialogue into an army of characters and keep you on the edge - it is literally impossible to stop reading this series - and you have a epic writer of uncommon gifts. I have not seen the HBO production and currently inhaling the 3rd installment. As I am NOT a sci-fi reader (or any fiction fan at that) my first shock was that fiction, for all I disparage it, can at times surpass all the academic research and interpretation as the most adept presentation of information - and this is definitely one of those times; I wonder if I will see anything close to this again?<br /><br />Of all the many aspects of this series that Martin has done with grace, power, keen eye for dramatic twists, I think I appreciate the character of Tyrion the most, and for reasons that I didn't even grasp until the end of the second in this series. I won't give it away, but for serious history buffs this may well be the most interesting take on one of Shakespeare's (no less) most masterful, controversial, even incendiary characters that I have ever come across. If he is who I suspect Martin is alluding to then I am simply overwhelmed, a huge BRAVO!
B0000AK7AB|1.0|The movie is great. This disc will end up in your trashcan in pieces unless you have the patience of a saint. Universal pictures has decided that you are paying them for the imperative privilege of watching ten minutes of previews. /Dumb/ previews, through which you cannot fast forward and from which you cannot access the main menu. Buy the movie elsewhere or pirate it.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Metro PCS Samsung Galaxy Indulge (no root)\n\nI got lucky and purchased this during a killer sale. \nHaving said that, I think this game could certainly be worth the asking price of $8 to a true fan of this genre.\nI can&apos;t believe how many years this game took me back as soon as it started. \nFrom the odd English terms the Japanese decided to use in translation here and there to the annoying long ass conversations that keep you from jumping into a fight and really enjoying the game. \nBravo to another developer that knows how to incorporate new technology while staying true to the original classic rpg formula.
B005DD7H50|3.0|I thought the movie was just o.k..  I agree with other reviewers that the concept is terrific.  Since I'm not an action movie junkie, the concept is what drew me in.  I just have to say, for someone with \\"limitless\\" brain power, this guy made some pretty terrible decisions.  Probably the best part of the movie was discussing what we would have done with limitless potential once the movie was over.  Getting involved with a Russian psychopath mobster was not at the top of anyone's list!

B004XE0P5E|4.0|I'm new to Bon Iver.  I didn't even know about the guy until I heard his stuff sampled in Kanye's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.  Justin Vernon (the creative mind behind Bon Iver) is a talented songwriter and this album is a solid piece of work.  If you liked his debut (For Emma, Forever Ago) then you should enjoy this album.  It has the same feel and soul behind it as For Emma did but whereas that album was sparse and featured very little instrumentation, this new album has upped the ante in every possible way.  More instruments, guest session players and a bigger more rock-like sound.  Some of you may be sad to see that he hasn't further explored his folk rock sound from his first album, but I think he pulled off a rare feat: changing his sound while ensuring his music kept the same heart.  Overall, a solid album and definitely worth a listen.
0307716511|4.0|Beatrice Hemming is living an exciting but stable life in New York City when she receives word that her beloved younger sister Tess has gone missing. She travels home to London to deal with Tess' disappearance, and the police soon discover her body. The police believe that Tess committed suicide, but Beatrice is completely unconvinced.    The story is told in the form of a letter from Beatrice to Tess. We know right from the start that this wasn't suicide and that Tess was actually murdered, but it's how Beatrice comes to that realization that's most interesting. She's meeting with the prosecutor on her sister's case, and she tells the story to him and to Tess in a series of flashbacks.    Beatrice is an interesting character. She's very devoted to her younger sister, although she's lived somewhat in her shadow, Tess being the beautiful and lively one. But she doesn't ever seem to resent Tess, and her steadfast loyalty to Tess and her refusal to believe that Tess could have killed herself make her very likable, even as the police suggest that she may not have known her sister as well as she thought.    Sister is a remarkable first novel by Rosamund Lupton. It's both an engrossing mystery and a moving tale of sisterly love. I couldn't put it down.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|Writer/director Adam Green (Hatchet), maintains that the central premise of his movie Frozen (2010) is quite realistic, where three friends out for a weekend of skiing, suddenly find themselves in a tough situation, and having to make some hard decisions.  If you haven't seen the film, major spoilers follow so bail out now if you don't want to know what happens.<br /><br />After a day of skiing on the bunny slopes around Mount Holliston, Dan Walker (Kevin Zeggers), his girlfriend Parker (Emma Bell), and his best friend Joe Lynch (Shawn Ashmore), are taking the ski lift up for one final run.  When the lift suddenly stops moving, they are trapped some fifty feet in the air, high above the snow covered ground, as night falls.<br /><br />Most of the rest of the film focuses on the activities in the ski lift chair, and the immediate surrounding area.  To give the film a sense of realism, the film was shot on location, with the actors actually suspended on a real ski lift, at a resort in Utah.  Besides a tale of survival, the film also examines the relationships between the three characters.  The dynamic at play concerns Parker not being an experienced skier, and getting between two longtime friends.  While the behavior of these individuals isn't always credible, shooting on location adds many realistic facets to the film, as the actors are subjected to being at altitude in the harsh elements.<br /><br />It is a Sunday, and the group anticipates that resort will be closed for several days.  The immediate danger seems to be that they will freeze to death, and Dan decides to risk dropping to the ground, to try and get help. Unfortunately he breaks both his legs on the hard snow, and can't move.  When a pack of wolves arrives, a helpless Dan has no chance, and is killed, while his friends above listen to his screams.  After this emotional peak, Parker and Joe blame each other for Dan's death.  Joe decides that it is better to try to get down rather wait to die.  He bravely travels on the cable, which cuts into his hands and manages to reach a support tower which has a ladder down to the ground.  Fighting off the wolves, Joe races away on a snowboard.  Waiting for help to arrive, Parker is left in an unstable car, which eventually works loose and falls to the ground.  Suffering from frostbite she manages to avoid the wolves, and crawl and slide her way downhill.<br /><br />The mixture of reality and fantasy produces a story that is dramatic, without going totally off the deep end.  The presence of the wolves might be a questionable element, but the use of real animals is quite impressive.  While the characters are not the brightest people around, there at least seems to be some thought behind what they do.  An exception is Dan's descent, as there were some ways he could have softened his fall, although he probably would still have been badly hurt.  All the talking that Dan does when injured seems excessive, but given that his time is short, is understandable why Adam Green gave him the lines.  Green generally keeps his dialog restrained and real, and doesn't have his characters engage in pointless conversations.  When the cast is reduced to two, Shawn Ashmore and Emma Bell, impressively take their performances to a new level.<br /><br />Similar to recent films like [[ASIN:B002LBKE02 The Canyon]] (2008), and [[ASIN:B0039ZF87I Thirst]] (2010), Frozen is more a story of man against nature, rather than a horror or suspense thriller.  While not an action spectacular, Frozen is very competently told, and impressively real, rating a solid 3.5 stars.

B004EPYZQC|5.0|I always thought these movies were fun.  The street racing, the drama etc but this film is on a new level.  Everything I got in the old version of the \\"Italian Job\\" that I did not get in the new one is all here.  A crazy con, stunts reaching new heights in the art and a great story.  This movie is a must if you liked the \\"Italian Job\\".  I am so getting this on blu ray.

I will watch this film again and again just as I listen to the Beatles music.  I'm not a film critic, though they like this film too, but feeling good and laughing are still activities we could all use more of.  Get this film.  You'll be glad you did.

The bugs rattle just enough to draw attention to them, but not irritate adults. I wish the fit of these socks were a bit better. They could use more elastic to better fit a variety of baby feet sizes. Instead, they are more like an open tube that can be pulled up and easily kicked off.

1589944607|5.0|You've received your card: \\"You Are A Cylon.\\" Your goal is simple, the complete destruction of humanity. As far as you know, you're all alone. If you try to sabotage the humans too quickly, they'll see you for what you are. You have to take your time and build their trust. A crisis card is revealed that allows the current player is allowed to check someone's loyalty card. You've been waiting patiently for your opportunity but it's too late, you're going to lose.    \\"Sorry guys, he's not a Cylon\\"    In that instant, you can barely keep your poker face as your heart pounds in your chest. Not only are you still in this, but now you know who your partner is.    Battlestar Galactica is a semi-cooperative board game that isn't really about the board at all, the game itself is merely a vehicle for the intrigue and accusations between the players. The theme of the show is captured perfectly in the secret loyalty cards distributed before the game starts (and again halfway through the game to simulate \\"sleeper agents). Each card tells the player which team they're playing for, then the game begins as though everybody is on the human team. Every turn, skill checks will come up that the players have to pass by putting color coded cards face down on the table. Some of the cards contribute, some sabotage the check. The players then shuffle them together and see if the check passed. If it doesn't, the humans usually lose points in one of the four vital resources they need to stay alive. If any of these resources are depleted, the Cylon players win.    The Cylon players usually play along and make it apparent that there is no sabotage for the first portion of the game. When they do subtract from the check, they must be very careful to only add colors the other players could have added, to keep suspicions off of them. Otherwise, the other players can lock the Cylon up which severely hampers their ability to interfere in the humans' skill checks.    Overall, this game is incredibly well presented. As is common with Fantasy Flight Games, the components and cards are very well crafted and durable. Even though there are a number of them, it never seems to interfere with what's going on. Unfortunately, a common problem with Fantasy Flight is their long, intricate, sometimes poorly worded rule books. This is an especially big problem with Battlestar Galactica because of the secret nature of the game, the wrong question at the wrong time could reveal your motives and ruin the game. Time is also an issue, games can regularly run between 2 and 3 hours.    This game is a must have for anybody who shares a love of Battlestar Galactica and games of any stripe, but anybody who likes board games more involved than Risk or Monopoly should give it a try.
0393976041|3.0|A book review: Pride and Prejudice<br />Just a little over a hundred years ago, Mark Twain made the following comment about Jane Austen. The first reference is to another author. Twain was aware of gender differences. \\"To me his prose is unreadable -- like Jane Austin's [sic]. No there is a difference. I could read his prose on salary, but not Jane's. Jane is entirely impossible. It seems a great pity that they allowed her to die a natural death.\\"<br />- Letter to W. D. Howells, 18 January 1909<br /><br />Mark Twain was a cynic. I am not a cynic. I do not have such strong feelings about Jane Austen's works, although \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the only book of hers that I have read or will ever read. I read \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" because I have a wonderful and lovely daughter-in-law who's opinion I trust. She loves Jane Austen's books and has read each a number of times. I just had to see what it was all about, so I decided upon \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" which is supposed to be Austen's best.<br /><br />Now, finally to the review. I thought it would have been better if Austen had included some fist fights and several explosions. For any who think that I may not have finished the review, this is indeed the end.
0545259088|2.0|I wanted to like this book; the first two were great.  The book was slow and repetitive.  How many ways and how many times can one say, \\"Gee, my life has been a real bummer!\\"  The book was filled with teen angst and I kept thinking, \\"I've already read this (Sam, Grace, Cole, Isabel ruminating)fifty times. Get on with the story.\\"  That was the problem; very little story or action.  The book didn't go anywhere.  Is it just me or did Sam appear rather \\"slow?\\"  I can't count the times that he just \\"stood there\\" because he couldn't think of anything to say. The ending was was not conclusive and left us with the option of writing our own ending.  My ending would be that Sam grew up and could actually respond to comments or questions.  Grace told her parents to be as mature as she was.  Everyone was cured by Cole's formula.  Cole returned to being a rock star and Isabel was his new agent.  They finally get married and have six kids (names the first boy Jaimie) and Cole gives up fame to become a research scientist.  Sam and Grace become psychiatrist and physician, respectively, get married and have four children.  They all move to the island and restore the lodge (I really wanted that described in the book) to its former glory headed up by decorator extraordinaire, Isabel. Cole has a top notch research lab on the island. He and his father reconcile, are partners in the lab and discover the cure for the common cold.  They rid the island of mosquitoes and poison ivy and live happily ever after.  Oh, wait!  The kids grow up, are infected by a dormant activated by an earthquake (the adults are immune) and the story begins all over!
B0034G4ORC|4.0|If you are looking for a suspense filled drama with gritty plot twists and amazing script writing, then you should probably not be putting your hands on a movie called \\"Battle: Los Angeles\\" and no, its not a cultural profile of gang warfare in LA. If you are however looking for an interesting action movie with a refreshing approach to alien invasion and how our very normal, but very well trained armed forces would face them then this is as perfect as it gets. Black Hawk Down meets Independence Day with more action and less funny side chatter.
0062060554|5.0|I loved the story of Christine, a 47 year old woman who suffered a traumatic accident and lives with memory loss so profound that each day she must relearn who she is as well as all the details of her life. Her husband Ben seems to be of no help in assisting her in piecing together her memories and though Christine has strong gut reactions to what is happening to her, for example she seems to feel when people are lying to her, in her fragile state she is constantly second guessing these feelings. This aspect alone was fascinating because without that framework, all her gut reactions seem to be working against her. Turns out that in spite of everything, Christine isnt as lost as it would seem. The story takes on a sinister twist building to a strong finish as we learn what really happened to her on that fateful day, 20 years earlier. Perhaps some may guess parts of the story before they are revealed but seen through Christine's eyes there are so many twists and turns that this book never loses its ability to surprise the reader.<br /><br />Check out my book review blog: [....]

Why do we skip winners? Why do we take losers? Why do we cut our profits, and let our losers run?  \\"Everyone gets out of the markets what they want\\" - Ed Seykota, my favorite quote from the book. More accurately stated, EVERYONE GETS OUT OF THE MARKET WHAT THEY FEAR MOST.  I found the interview with Van Tharpe to be the most informative chapter in the book.

Now I know the real holy grail lies within me. Thanks, Jack.

That a repertory house like the Met could easily cast this huge opera in 1968 with in-house talent is amazing.  Obviously, the ringers are Nilsson, Vickers, and Ludwig.  Personally, I think that Thomas Stewart is miscast as Wotan; his better Wagnerian role is Hans Sachs.  Recording wise, these cds have a surprisingly dry mono accoustic with compressed dynamics.  Stage noise is not a problem though.  This a fleetly paced performance that fits easily on three cds.  So, audiophiles will be disappointed with this release; but singing afficiandos will rejoyce.
B000AYQNYI|4.0|One my fave albums of all time. The album itself gets six stars ;o)    I bought this hoping for an 'audiophile' stereo master. I have the previous 90's era remaster and I also bought the recent special edition.     As suspected the new special edition is mastered to be very loud. It sounds ok, probably because the music itself comes from a time when everything wasn't 'in your face' and has some room to breath within the mix. However, with the special edition coming in with average RMS levels of -9.x, I was hoping the stereo mixes on this 'dual disc' would be far more conservative.    Turns out the CD stereo master is only marginally less limited. Average RMS levels of -10.x but unlike the special edition that peaks at something like -0.2db, the dualdisc hits 0db which is another surprise given the risk of inter-sample clipping from the limiting. In reality, it's a much of a muchness as -0.2 is nowhere near low enough to prevent ISCs and lo and behold both masters a riddled with them.    The biggest disappointment of all is that the 'hi-res' DVD-A stereo masters are just as bad! In fact, they are identical aside from being 96/24 vs 44.1/16. This is a disgrace as the DVD-A is supposed to be about the best audio quality. I guess they've just included the 96k version as a bonus (as it will have been created as part of the mastering process anyway) rather than doing a new master for the DVD-A. I'm sceptical about the advantages of 96k/24 for a playback format itself so having the same heavily limited material in this format is no advantage. And for those of you who are interested in frequencies above 20k (whether you can hear them or not)...well, I didn't see any on this master so don't worry ;o)    I should point out that I don't have a surround set-up and perhaps (and it seems from the other comments) that the surround mix is great. Must get surround!!!    I don't know if this will be of any use to anyone as dualdisc is on its way out so I understand, but if I save someone some money then great...Mind you, the album is so good it's probably worth it regardless, haha.
B004PVKFR8|3.0|Like many others, the debut single, \\"Sail\\", grabbed my attention by being not quite like anything else I've heard recently. Unfortunately, \\"Sail\\" is not in any way representative of the entire album from which it is taken. Unlike this single, most of the songs have fairly straightforward pop hooks and uninspired lyrics. This does not mean the songs are bad, as most of them are quite catchy and you can easily find yourself singing along. However, the tone set by \\"Sail\\" is not met by the rest of the tracks and that was a significant letdown.    In addition, some of the tracks seem frenetic in their pacing and transitions, as if AWOLNATION has too much energy to allow the tracks to gel. \\"Soul Wars\\", \\"Jump on My Shoulders\\", and \\"Not Your Fault\\" especially suffer from mismatching different styles in ways that don't transition well, such as pop-driven verses matched with a pulsing, heavier rock chorus (or vice versa). Songs like \\"People\\" and \\"Kill Your Heroes\\" are just uninspiring, despite catchy hooks.    On the bright side, there are some flashes of brilliance that make me excited for the next effort from AWOLNATION. Aside from \\"Sail\\", I found \\"Guilty Filthy Soul\\" and \\"Burn it Down\\" to be rather good, although nothing like the debut single, as previously mentioned. Nothing on the album is pure garbage, but a lot of it is just average.    One final good thing: AWOLNATION sounds pretty good live. Not really relevant to the album, but I saw them last week at Prophet Bar in Dallas, TX, and the quality of the live music is on par with the studio recordings. Can't say the show was particularly entertaining, but the music was good.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|The easy narrative of this novel makes the read lighthearted and fun, despite its relatively dark theme. It wasn't what I expected from the description, but I still rate it at about 4 stars. It's a great \\"young adult\\" reality-meets-otherworldly novel that even adults will enjoy. The author is very skilled at creating an atmospheric scene. I could almost \\"feel\\" the weather in the story & the reader is drawn into events right along with Jacob. I found it hard to put down once I started it.<br /><br />My main issue with the novel is that it contained a lot of photographs and pictures of letters that were not too Kindle-friendly (imagine trying to read a facsimile of handwriting shrunk down to Kindle screen size and you'll get an idea of what I mean). This might be one of the few novels better read in DTB format.
0671027344|5.0|I picked up this book about a week ago, because my English teacher had recomended it, and I imeditally fell in love. The book is written in such a way, where you can relate to the main character and actually feel the emotions he's feeling. I read the book in four hours because I couldn't bare to put it down. This book definitly changed me. I think about life a little differently after I read this. There are some books that everyone absolutely needs to read and this is one of them.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Rick Riordan did not lose steam. The Lost Hero is just as thrilling as the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. My daughter and I can't wait for the next installment!
1932100660|5.0|Give this book to every friend and family member you think could benefit from it. It's life-saving information. Why wait?
B004Z7AHZC|3.0|Unlike the first Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie, the filmmakers were a little more brave this time around and strayed further away from the book. My main problem with the first movie was that EVERY joke and scene was from the book, and they often wern't exectued as well as they should have been. Rodrick Rules improves, but it still needs work. This time around, Greg is trying to impress Holly Hills and sometimes the movie turns a bit absurd. For instance, the party scene from the book goes WAY too far in the movie. I also thought the church scene was way too unrealistic. It's okay, though, and the story can be described as \\"heartwarming\\". Not a bad rental for families.

0553386794|5.0|A Game of Thrones does not have the usual fantasy lore. Instead it's a harsh, bitter, and even realistic world where there is betrayal, death, wars, and maybe even dragons. There are so many characters in this book that it may become hard to follow except for the handy guide in the back of the book. Book 1 in A Song of Ice and Fire is very well-paced, each conversation in the book has meaning and there's a battle or a twist whenever it starts to feel a little slow. This is an expertly written book, and easily the best in the series so far.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|The backpack is for my high school aged son.  He is very happy with it and everything fits just fine.  It is very rugged and feels very durable.  We bought another Swissgear a couple years ago and it still serves it's purpose.  It was just time for a new backpack for a new school. The bottom of the backpack is thick and feels like it will withstand the tortures that a high schooler will put on it.  We are very happy with it.
0451196716|3.0|There's no doubt that the premise of Stephen King's The Long Walk is interesting. 100 boys are in a contest to see who can walk the longest, if you go under four miles per hour three times, than you are killed. The last one standing gets whatever they want for the rest of their life. It certainly sounds promising enough, but the problem here is the whole book is walking. I guess that's the point, but the story must rely on the dialogue to keep interesting. The story follows Ray Garraty, who joins the Long Walk because.....he wants to die? The other characters are the ones that keep the story going, as they constantly talk, mess around, and eventually die. It's a grueling tale, but does it stay interesting? Not really. I felt no urge to read it again once I had finished it, but that's not to say I wasn't interested to see who dies when. The ending is not really clear and can be discussed for hours. The Long Walk isn't bad, but there are better Stephen King books.

B0000024IE|5.0|Chuck D the philosopher. Terminator X invented the Chronic beat and mixed it with hardcore funk. Still the hardest and most original sound.  harder than all the fake \\"gangstas\\" that came er...years after.  Stole the medium but never got the message. No wonder this album is one of the top crossover albums of all time.  Go to the concert and every kid white or black  knows every lyric by heart.  Saw Flav stage dive into a crowd of white skinheads at Studio 54.  Love you PE  WHO GIVE A FK ABOUT A GD GRAMMY!!!
B000NA2BEU|3.0|First, I love Veronica Mars. Cleverly written, generally well acted, good production values. Not to mention that Kristen Bell is a little doll! I would rank the first two seasons among my top 10-15 all time favorite shows. It started out strong in season 3 as well, but then began fading. By this time, several interesting characters were gone- Kendall Casablancas (Charisma Carpenter)and Aaron Echolls (Harry Hamlin)most important among them. Another problem with the third season is that there were too many threads left hanging and unexplained subplots, perhaps to have been picked up in the 4th season, which never materialized. I suspect that late in the 3rd season, cast, crew, and writers knew they were not to be picked up for another season, and everything started going downhill. If you haven't seen this series, you may be able to find some episodes online to see if you like it. I was poking around free TV sites (legal sites, paid for by advertising, of course)when I first found this series. But then if you do like it, I would say the first two seasons are probably a buy, but could only marginally recommend the 3rd season.
0061438294|5.0|I hardly feel the need to submit another five-star review, since there are so many here. I'll just add that Navarro's book gives some excellent explanations not just of the tells, but of the why behind them as it relates to our natural freeze/flight/fight responses. When you understand these relationships, it is much easier to figure out and remember what different body language might be telling you. He is also good about reminding you of the limits of body language -- that it is much better for identifying stress than truth -- and that clusters of signs are more reliable than isolated signs.
B002ZG9800|1.0|The writers took what could have been a great true story of a charismatic conman who evolved from a small town businessman to a white collar criminal, who has little regard for the law.  The conman is crafty and talented and escapes a Texas prison on four separate occasions to be with his true love. Poor judgment in the casting of Jim Carey who turned the film into a piece of crap.  Great story, it deserved better,too bad.

1903931843|5.0|Another great read from Chloe. As the story unfolds you share the the thoughts and feelings of Greta on her wonderful adventure. It made me wonder if we all need some kind of grooming and training before we reach adulthood. A good book and one I will enjoy to read again.
0195145925|2.0|I would tell you what I thought of the book.  But since the author's point is that time does not exist, how could I have been expected to have the time to read this book.  And pulleaze don't tell me that I could have assembled a whole bunch of consecutive moments because I swear, no pun intended, I will clock you!  Like I say, no time to read it.
B0050PYNO4|4.0|The movie:<br />- This is a pretty humorous take on 2 friends from England that are in the USA for the first time and they plan to take a road trip to famous UFO sites. This idea was hatched because they are comic-con fans. One is a Science Fiction writer and the other illustrates his work.<br />- While running (driving) away from some locals they accidently offended, they meet Paul. Paul is the alien who crashed on earth in the 40's (Roswell I think). He is on the run from the FBI because he has out-lived his usefullness to them. They agree to help him get to his friends. They meet Kristen Wigg along the way who is a devout christian but she is faced with a life changing realization when she meets Paul. She then decides she will curse, fornicate, lie, cheat, sin, etc. Kristen Wigg pulls this off very well because her swearing is ill-timed and she has no idea how to swear. Very funny.<br />- Some drug references. There is a scene with Paul and Kristen Wigg smoking pot. It is short if you are not crazy about drug humor. Not as funny as it could be but I'm sure they cut it short for good reasons.<br />- Some touching moments where Paul heals a cast member. Another scene that was no Oscar moment but it changed up the tempo of this comedy. (ET reference?)<br />- Cameo's galore in this film and nods/winks to famous scifi shows abound in this flick. Bobby Lee as a Valet who is tipped in change and they drop the change on the ground, he yells \\"F-ing Orcs!\\". Too funny. One stop along their way, they reenact the Star Trek fight of Kirk and the Lizard Man in the desert.<br />Negative:<br />Why was there so little appearance of Seth Rogen in the DVD features? He voiced the main character. No interviews with him, no commentary, only a little bit of CG work was shown.<br />It's worth the watch. It's probably for select audiences but is still a funny film to see.
B004OEMRGI|4.0|If love at first sight takes your breath away, then true love surely fills your lungs and sustains you.  `Agadez', the new album by the incredibly talented guitarist Bombino, is very much a story of true love.  And, indeed, the opening moments of the first track, titled \\"I Greet My Country\\", hit you with an instant reflexive need to breathe in deeply.<br /><br />Mali and Niger have produced a bounty of the world's greatest guitar players of late, so it is no surprise to find that Bombino hails from the arid lands of western Niger.  It is to this land, and for his people, that he lovingly sings and strums.<br /><br /> Throughout the experience, the progressive scales feel like a perfectly rythmic stair climbing.  Even in portions where the chords repeat, the throbbing drums give the music a living heartbeat that charms your own heart into falling in line.  A major part of the album's charm is in the restraint shown in keeping rhythm and harmony at the forefront . . . A noticeable achievement given that guitar chops like these nearly always lend towards highly experimental experiences.  In rare moments where the music breaks loose, the results are magical. During the ending of \\"You, My Beloved\\" an ethereal yelling ushers in a particularly wonderful unrestrained portion of the album, one of many little treasure chests of sound you'll find throughout the album.<br /><br />The soundscape you travel during `Agadez' is vast, with each track marking a unique path on the larger journey, but the album is constructed in a strikingly professional manner that leaves you feeling uplifted and optimistic from start to finish . . . a striking tone since the background of objects of affection have been in a perpetual state of conflict and persecution.<br /><br />Sung entirely in Bombino's native Taureg tongue, Tamasheq, the album is still accessible and does everything possible to be so- offering English translations of all song titles and lyrics as well as pictures of Agadez playing to his homeland.<br /><br />*** Visit SiafuSounds.com for all my Album Reviews ***t SiafuSounds.com for all my Album Reviews ***

B004DI7HZ6|3.0|It took a while for the book to get going.  I didn't hate this book, but I didn't love it either.  I will admit, tho, it actually left me wanting to read the sequel...because toward the end, I actually started to like a lot of the characters.  I don't agree with the 1-star reviews of this book...it's not THAT bad.  It is what it is...a vampire/witch romance novel with a lot of Twilight-ish feel to it.  If that's what you're gunning for, give it a shot!

0240815807|5.0|I found this to be an incredible asset for me. I am a singer/songwriter and producer and this filled in   all the gaps in mixing I needed. Coming from an analogue to a digital world this made the transition  seamless. Great writing, helpful outline of how things work and what to watch for.
B00005N5S5|2.0|I am not writing this review lightly.  Being a sci-fi fan myself, and of the movies by James Cameron, from Alien to Titanic, I have now watched the original Terminator three times, and with each successive viewing, I come away more disappointed with the film.  So here goes my critique; I'll assume everyone reading this knows most of the plot details already.<br /><br />First of, the whole context for the story-line is ridiculous.  Both Kyle Reese and the Terminator go back in time to find Sarah Conner.  The machine that sent them back was built by SkyNet, which is a fictitious A.I. that has taken over the world's military and enslaved humanity.  If SkyNet is smart enough to build a time machine to send this Terminator back in time to kill Sarah Conner, and was smart enough to send the Terminator to LA, where Sarah Conner lives, then why send a Terminator who has to buy guns?  It would seem more reasonable to send a Terminator containing a nuclear device, and just blow up LA altogether, which would surely either kill Sarah Conner, or render her infertile from the radiation.<br /><br />But logic aside, lets look at the movie in closer detail.  The very first scene of the movie when the Terminator makes contact with people illustrates the physical capabilities of this cyborg.  He kicks ass, without using any guns.  So why does he need to go steal a bunch of guns?  In fact, it is clear that when the Terminator first finds his target in the nightclub, the amount of time it takes for him to draw a weapon is just enough for Kyle Reese to intervene.  Why not just walk up to her and break her neck.  It would have been much quicker, and in the noise and music of the setting, the Terminator might have gotten away with it unnoticed.  In fact, there are various times in the movie where the Terminator fails to terminate.  Probably the most glaring one is the truck chase scene near the movie's end.  Here we have the Terminator on a motorcycle chasing Kyle and Sarah in a sedan.  They crash and the sedan flips over, pinning Sarah and Kyle.  The Terminator is dragged away by an oncoming truck.  When it comes around, it does not run towards the flipped-over sedan to kill Kyle and Sarah straight away.  Instead, it takes the time to run the other way, commandeer a truck, start it up, turn it around, and drive towards them to try and run them over.  Sarah and Kyle are on foot, the most maneuverable form of movement possible by man, yet the Terminator decides he needs to drive a cumbersome 18-wheeler to try and catch them.  This is one of the glaring examples of a director killing logic so that the movie can have a couple of minutes of extra action scenes.  Utterly stupid and a waste of screen time.<br /><br />Another drawback of this movie was the acting.  Its as if a bunch of writers came together and figured out the best way to make a movie with the minimal amount of acting skill.  For the Terminator part; well just find a big guy who can walk around firing away with a grim face and utter a line here and there.  For the rest, lots of ducking, screaming, and faces of shock and awe.  Of all the James Cameron movies, this probably has the worst acting of them all.<br /><br />Maybe my biggest beef of the movie was the hairstyles.  I grew up in the 1980's, which is when this movie takes place, and I don't remember any of the adults having the puffy hair like they do in this movie.  Overall, a crappy movie that somehow struck a nerve with the American psyche.  It did however start a sub-genre within sci-fi films of men making machines that take over the world, i.e. the Matrix trilogy and Battlestar Galactica reboots owe their origins to this film.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|This book was a sad disappointment.  Repetitious, meandering, nonsensical.  I'm annoyed at George RR Martin for leading us on for five years and delivering this and taking my money.  Martin is an amazing writer.  The first three books are a testament to that. Like many have said, this book screamed for an editor.  I will not be buying any more books in this series, even if I am curious about the outcomes.  I am not giving this author any more of my money.  There are so many more authors capable of keeping their writing tight and interesting, hungry to impress and working hard that deserve our money.
1932100660|5.0|I loved this book!!! It was so eye opening and really makes you rethink the American lifestyle. Just think of the lives and money we could safe if people used diet to fix their sickness instead of procedures and pills. Everyone needs to at least read this book and evaluate their current ways of eating. Although its a little depressing to think how stubborn people are to change their diets to being more plant based I believe it can be done....even if it has to be one person at a time. As a future RD this book has inspired me to promote the power of fruits and veggies to heal america :)
B004YEJGEO|5.0|This is a good puzzle game. It starts out easy but gets much more challenging reasonably quickly. Pretty addictive, at least it has been for the past few days.
B00007H1Y2|1.0|quality of cd is very bad,  last 2 songs will not even read on cd player or my laptop.  not at all happy and probably will no longer order form amazon.com if this is the quality of the product they carry.
B004YM67OI|3.0|I have a feeling that Unknown may actually not be that good of a movie, but for some reason, Neeson is enthralling in these sort of high-stakes Eurotrips. It's a great setup. Neeson is knocked unconcious in the opening minutes, is in a coma for a few days, and when he finally wakes up, he finds someone else has taken over his life. No one believes Neeson's story -- probably because his wife doesn't back him up. This leaves the rest of the movie for Liam to run around Berlin, trying to prove his case and uncovering a vast Eco-terror plot in the process.<br /><br />Liam simply owns these movies, and it's too his credit that he's reinvented himself as a thinking man's action star. There's also great supporting work from Diane Kruger as the cab driver who helps him (she doesn't get nearly enough work in Hollywood). If only the script had been a little better. Too many times they get help out of nowhere, from a kind-hearted nurse who just happens to know a former East German spy with nothing better to do but take on seemingly insane American hospital patients. It also helps that Diane's cab driver character is on good terms with a nightclub bouncer, giving them a great hideout when they're on the run from mysterious agents.<br /><br />As the twists and turns mount, you think you're headed to a great pay-off, but the final twist seems too fabricated and unlikely, based on a serious of miraculous incidents (not least of which is why Liam cracked his head in the first place). It should also be noted that January Jones as the wife has a certain woodenness to her performance that has left many forests envious.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|Let's face it: if you're wondering whether or not to buy Tron: Legacy 3D Blu Ray, you know if you like the movie or not, and are more concerned with the image quality and sound quality. Let me start by saying this is the first 3D blu ray I've purchased (my television came with Avatar 3D). I use a Panasonic 50 in. plasma, with active 3D. I have a pretty run of the mill surround sound stereo that I ran straight from my PS3 through AV cords. In other words, my television is fantastic, but my sound leaves something to be desired.     The 3D of Tron in theaters was, in my oppinion, the fourth best at the time of its release (Avatar, How to train your Dragon, and Toy Story 3 were above it). In my home however, this film looked fantastic. The depth of the 3D was great and the quality of the image is met only by Avatar's 3D Blu Ray. There are scenes that were filmed for IMAX and, like The Dark Knight, the blu ray keeps this aspect ratio for Tron. Personally, I loved this, my only complaint being that it makes the non-IMAX scenes feel less exciting.     The sound was another high point for this movie. The soundtrack is phenomenal and I can only imagine that on a better sound system, this would be the best sounding movie released on blu ray yet (them's fightin' words!).     All-in-all, buy this. It's a fun movie with an even better presentation that will make you satisfied with your 3D television purchase.
1595825045|4.0|Really liked it, but it was confusing the way it was set up, as if were in a play:  each author/animator's section was not obviously differentiated from the other, and the \\"I\\" therefore was not clearly linked to which author.
B00007K02F|4.0|WAY BETTER THAN THE 1997 CIARAN HINDS VERSION. I enjoyed this Jane Eyre version with William Hurt, but the 2006/2007 Masterpiece theatre version I thought was much better...This movie felt like it was 'rushed' towards the end. Like they were running out of time and had to hurry up and finish it. I think it would've been better if they had added another 30 minutes or so to it. Other than that, the acting was great. But after seeing Toby Stephens in that 2006 version I am used to him in the role. I like William Hurt but i prefer Toby in the role of mr Rochester.
0553801473|1.0|The first couple of volumes of this series were truly intriguing.  It was a little off-putting that Martin's proven creativity was a little lacking with the obvious theme for the work being the English Wars of the Roses with a map that looked suspiciously like England (including Hadrian's Wall), two contending families, Stark (York) and Lannister (Lancaster) and knights being called \\"ser\\" instead of \\"sir.\\"  But he told a rousing good tale anyway.  After investing many hours reading the now five 1,000-page installments, we deserve better than people just going and going from place to place.  I know he's busy doing his HBO mini-series on this subject, but he needs to wrap this baby up before he dies on us.  I'd recommend just skipping this volume and hoping that the next one is the finale.  You won't miss much.  He definitely phoned this one in.

0553801473|2.0|Were this book written by anyone but GRRM, it would be laughed out of the publisher's office. It has no real plot development. There is no build up of story. No climax. Characters and story arcs are still being introduced in the final chapters... It's just a \\"whole lot of nothing\\" interrupted by main characters dying every now and then for no discernible reason other than GRRM doesn't know what to do with them anymore.

1451629184|5.0|I can't say that I \\"enjoyed\\" reading this book... but who really can.  It is difficult to stomach, and there is part of me that almost wishes I did not read the book.  The book takes you to a very dark place, and it's not a place most of us want to ever go or even hear about.  Some of the images brought to me from the book will always haunt me.      Having said all of those things, I was inspired by the human spirit.  I needed to read this book because I couldn't understand how someone could survive an ordeal like that.  Jaycee took me through her journey and gave me a glimpse of how her mind worked during those years and what things she held on too as hope.  It's amazing how resiliant the human mind can be even in such dire circumstances.      I find it very annoying to read the 1 star reviews from people who obviously didn't read the prologue \\"Author's Note\\" in the beginning.  She clearly explains that this book will not be organized in a traditional fashion, but in the disjoined and confused fashion she lived it.  This book is a memoir... not an autobiography or a novel.  I was very pleased at how real and honest the book was instead of simply \\"well organized.\\"  If I want well organized, I will read Martha Stewart's biography.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|I was intrigued by the HBO show, so I bought the books.  At first, the story was great.  Books always give you more insight to the story.  After finishing the 4th book, I've about had enough.  The story drags along with too many tedious descriptions, lists of names that don't matter, \\"F\\" bombs, and porn that would be better found in a Hustler.  It feels like Martin started out with a good story and decided to stretch it out as much as possible so he could sell more books.  I won't be buying the 5th book.  I'm disappointed.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, so much that I saw it again the next day. The film did a good job of showing the daily hustle of life as a criminal defense attorney and the bit players that all profit off of the cases. Terrific acting, cracking good script, realistic dialogue, and a good suspenseful story.  The directors pacing and visual look of the film kept my attention throughout the movie.  I can't say much more as it is really easy to ruin this movie by revealing the details.
B0055V0HXO|4.0|I discovered Karmakanic only a few months ago with \\"Who's the Boss in the Factory\\". I really enjoyed this album and I found Karmakanic a little less boring than The Flower Kings, in the sense that they're not going into 15 minute instrumental strange stuff :) I find this new album even better than the previous one, all songs delivers something and I could hear different music styles in all of them, with the progressive aspect being omnipresent.<br /><br />Really nice album, I think :) I do not put 5 stars in case they do something really awesome one day :D
0062060554|4.0|I was engrossed in this book from the beginning. It's an intriguing concept. The best part is the end with a twist that I didn't forsee.  I really know I enjoy a book when I can remember the name AND the story enough to recommend it to others. I don't think I will forget this one. It's a short list that fit into this category.
B003K025V4|5.0|I have loved Miley Cyrus since 2006. I love the songs she puts out. This CD is very good. Every song on it is amazing. She isn't a child anymore, and people need to accept that, and stop judging her for growing up. She is a great singer and a fantastic actress. This CD is a definite favorite.
B005BZQTGS|1.0|this movie was just so ridiculous the jokes was just disgusting i watched the whole thing thinking it will get better but just got more disgusting by the minute  i really wasted my time looking at this movie.  How the hell James Franco and Natalie Portman agree to do this crappy movie, well that is just my opinion. Worst movie i saw in a very long time.
0811879542|5.0|We just received this book last night and already my 3.5 year old son has asked us to read it a half dozen times. He has also taken to reading it to himself. The book is not complicated, nor does it contain a ton of words, but it is very fun and interactive. I highly recommend it!
B0055B0MIO|5.0|Trivium's brand of music is metal plain and simple. They are one of the few consistent bands around today, which means a couple of things; you can expect melody which I think is overlooked in metal across the board and second you can expect a dare I say subtle type of aggression. Melody is something that metalheads tend to view as a weakness in a metal album, I think a lot of people get lost in guitar solos and blatant anger and aggression, and Trivium I don't believe buy into that philosophy completely. They seem to make metal songs that are accessible to almost everyone. I have friends that only listen to rap and then I play some Trivium and they really buy into the band. Before I get absolutely slaughtered let me just say that being accessible to even the most casual listener of metal music is not a bad thing. If more bands could find a balance metal music would have truly survived the turn of the century and I say this because it really had become more of a niche style of music and that is really too bad. Bands like Judas Priest and Iron Maide and even Metallica were very widely praised and listened to by millions in their era and that just really isn't true these days for the more modern metal band and I think Trivium bucks the trend as much as they possibly can.<br /><br />That being said I think this is Trivium's magnum opus and eventhough it has gotten some disappointing reviews here I truly believe that those people will come around after giving it a few more listens. It seemed like an eternity since 'Shogun' which was a good album but 'In Waves' will be the album that Trivium is remembered for, the title track is worth the purchase price all on it's own and that is hard to do. Just give it a try and if you don't immediately buy in keep listening and everything in the album will tie in seemlessly.
0385342055|4.0|I bought this book because I love Kinsella's Shopaholic series. Though not her best, I liked it better than some reviews led me to believe. One just has to accept the fact that Becky is never going to change; once a shopaholic always a shopaholic. Minnie got on my nerves a little, but having been through that terrible two stage with my own children, her behavior didn't surprise me.  Where the book fell short was toward the end.  Becky's burgeoning relationship with her supposedly evil mother-in-law, Eleanor, was interesting to me, but completely came to a standstill as she planned Luke's surprise party.  There could have been many more heartfelt and mutually rewarding moments between them as well as with Minnie. Hopefully, Ms. Kinsella will pursue this relationship further in the next installment, which I'm sure will follow.
B0058FOB2K|5.0|All I can say is VICIOUS! My husband bought this for me and I Love it! Each CD she has releases is better than the last. Beyonce has never let me down, but she has absolutely floored me with 4. It's hard to find a CD that offers something on EVERY cut, but I love every song on this album, even the bonus cuts!
1439156816|5.0|When folks write about personal issues or situations, there lurks a reluctance to reveal truth.  Stephen King shares, with unadulterated honesty, those whom he loves with his reader.   Every man should have a similar mother who encourages him, and a similar wife who loves him with the same lusty, faithful exuberance.  After the stark honesty about his life, Mr. King then exposes secrets (yes, secrets) about being a writer.  He surprises you as he reveals the obvious (only you do not see the obvious until he reveals it) regarding various aspects of writing, particularly fiction, but his revelations fit any genre.  Thus the secrets become simple common sense.  After reading \\"On  Writing: 10th Anniversary Edition: A Memoir of the Craft\\", if you are not inspired by Stephen King's life, or if you do not become a better writer, the fault lies within you.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|I still enjoy this film.  It is one of those films that is fun and brings back some strong memories.  Robocop is another film that does the same.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Positives:  Fairly good spoofing of the stereotypic alien as we all know them and great parody of past alien movies. Creative storytelling, adult intelligent script (at times; crude at others); great casting and acting; good directing but nothing exemplary; good CG and would have rated better but now I'm comparing all CGs to Rango which may end up being an unreachable standard for animation studios for another year or more.     Practically all negative or one star reviews see an alien's presence as being anti-God, or at least anti-Christian. Perhaps all the alien is saying is respect his God, all Gods or no God but just don't go around repressing and shooting whatever because their God looks a little different than yours.     Negatives:   A bit of an inconsistent ebb 'n flow to the story resulting in a tendency to lose contact with the story.
B0057KXXFM|3.0|Les Claypool.  Jonathan Davis.  Anthony Keidis.  Not the greatest singers in the world but they have great lyrics and great bands to back them up.  Durst has the great band but he needs the great lyrics to go with it.  Durst is no Chris Cornell nor should he be.  His style fits the band just fine.  His delivery is interesting and has its own signature that's hard to imitate.  The only thing missing is content.  The lyrics on Gold Cobra feel rushed.  Almost freestyle.  It's like Durst had nothing to write about whatsoever.  Kind of funny since they haven't done anything musically in a couple years.  Hasn't anything interesting happened?!  Perhaps if we lock him in an abandoned mental institution for a week, he would be a bit more inspired.
B003ZHVJFK|1.0|Negatives:  (1.) There's a reason Redbox gets so many of these \\"never heard of it\\" straight to DVD movies because studios are trying to salvage some money from failed production investments.   (2.) A remake of gaming is a hollow excuse for praise because gaming stole the concepts from dozens of apocalyptic city-country movies which have been made for decades - there was nothing new in the story; in the sets; and in the really bad fight arts.  (3.) Not even worth $1. Not even worth fast forwarding which is the customary way to quickly end the suffering. After 5 minutes I just did 10 minute progress checks.   (4.) The arts looked more like ballet practice with the highly edited and trick camera angles turning the kicks, unfortunately, into dance stretching exercises. The few simplistic wire routines looked amateurish. The costumes looked like made-for-TV designed wardrobes. Acting - the nicest thing one could say is that they tried. I think.     Positive:  Even more appreciation now for these recent arts releases: \\"Man from Nowhere\\", \\"Legend of the Fist\\", \\"Ip Man 2\\", and the \\"The Warrior's Way\\".
B0015HOFZI|4.0|I bought the Sony PS-LX300USB USB Stereo Turntable a couple of months ago from Amazon and I couldn't be happier with it.  I have about 200 Lp's from the 70's and have recorded about half of them to digital with no issues at all from the turntable or software.  I'm using Windows 7 and the Soundforge software that came with the turntable is compatible with Windows 7 but as others have mentioned it could be more user friendly, especially if your not used to using and setting up audio software.     Once the software is loaded you will need to set up the recording level on your computer by doing the following: Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Manage audio devices > Click Recording Tab and scroll down to Microphone USB Audio Codec and set it as default > Now right click the Microphone USB Audio Codec and click properties then click the Levels Tab and set your recording level.  It will be set to 100 which is much too loud and will cause your recordings to sound distorted.  In my case I set it to 15 and it has been great.  You'll have to experiment to get the right level.     To get play back from your computer speakers open the Soundforge software and click Tools > Vinyl Recording and Restoration. This will open a window and just check Monitor Recording Level and you will be able to hear your recording through you computer.  There is also a Device Properties tab in the same window that you can click to set the recording level if you need to go up or down for a particular album, but I've never had to do this.    The Audio Restoration does take a lot of the clicks and noise out of the recording.  I only use the Peak Normalization when the overall recording is a bit low and it does work well for that.  The track finder works about 80% of the time and I just go back and copy, paste and save a new track for one that is not separated.  All in all I'm very satisfied with the turntable and software as it does a good job at turning old classics into MP3's.  Don't get me wrong,I'll never quit listening to vinyl, but it is hard to bring a turntable with you in the car.
B0000042H4|5.0|Just noticed that Wagner's 200th birthday anniversary is coming up in just a little over 21 months. Would it be too much to hope that London may decide on presenting one more reformatting of the great Solti Ring after the '97, 20 bit re-release. In other words in SACD? Esoteric in Japan released such an upgrade earlier this century, though it's apparently no longer available. Price was in the high 3 figures! Hopefully London/Decca, or whoever now holds the rights to the production will satisfy the mainstream of SACD lovers with a much more reasonable remastering!
B004Y1USV2|1.0|I'm with the nay-sayers.     Back in 1980, \\"Fly From Here\\" was a weak Buggles track rejected by Yes for inclusion in Drama. There are a couple of concert performances available where this is evident (The Word is Live). It was fluff pop then and has hardly fared better since. Therefore, the idea of exhuming this throwaway tune (31 years later!) and then extending it into a 20 minute 'suite' is nothing short of shocking. Could Yes really be so utterly bereft of ideas? (What do these guys do in their spare time??)     Like the title track, most of the album is facile pop, not too distant from the stinker that was Open Your Eyes. Heck, maybe Benoit should have written the music.     I was hopeful when I heard Horn would produce; you know, some risk-taking, a new vision, a daring approach, or the splash of inventiveness that injected fire into 90125. Nah, this could be anyone at the knobs. Horn would seem to have been seriously overtaken by the new generation of producers. His work here is merely undistinguished.     And to think that 30 years ago I thought these blokes would be writing wicked classical music by now. Ha!
B0007MWZEK|4.0|This is not the first swivel sweeper I have purchased.  I use it almost every day as I have cats and needless to say a LOT of hair around my home.  When the first one died, I thought I would just purchase another battery.  When shopping through Amazon, I found that forjust a few dollars more, I could get a new one with newer updates to it.  I love it!!!!
B004EPYZUI|3.0|I was really looking forward to this movie and couldn't wait to get it.  The world of sucker punch is extemely cool and the inspiring scenery was joy.  However, the story was unfulfilling.  I got the alternate realities, but the pay off should have been bigger.  The battle scenes were predictable and I found myself fast-forwarding through two of them.  If you want to see cute girls in combat, this would work for you, but i would recommend DOA: Dead or Alive (its more fun).  The story in sucker punch just falls short.
B0052ZQMLO|4.0|Other than being an excellent tool (whose print version I had/have been using for years), the Dictionary is really and easily set as default on the Kindle. The producer team has done a wonderful job.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|not as good as the others
B004FQKY5Q|3.0|Roxette is one of my all time favorite bands, therefore I was very excited to hear that there was a new album coming out after 10 years of silence. (Marie Fredriksson, the female vocalist, got a brain tumor in 2002, but is now well again.)<br />\\"Charm School\\" is a decent album with some really fine tracks, like rocker \\"Way Out,\\" dreamy \\"Speak to Me,\\" \\"Only When I Dream,\\" the rock-disco single \\"She's Got Nothing On (But the Radio)\\" and finally Beatles-esque \\"Dream On\\". The rest of the album is nice as well, but feel a bit too boring to me. What's bugging me the most is the production. Roxette, and foremost singer/songwriter/guitarist Per Gessle have been using producer Christoffer Lundquist since 2003 and it starts to get tedious. Chris is by all means a good producer but now they need some fresh fire under the pot.<br />All in all, pick up this album, or if you're in the US get it digitally, you won't regret it. It's not \\"Joyride\\" but it's damn good nevertheless.

B0055IU4GM|4.0|As I try to push John Hiatt on others, I am aware his music as he performs it is really not for everyone and I will continue with this one.  John Hiatt is the comsumate Americana song writer.  He captures all his observations and feelings in his music with the grit and smears of our society he is a wonderful part of.  I have been listening to his music since 95, 3/4ths of the way through his life.  He continues with this CD to deliver the feelings of his life with gutsy delivery.  This is another of his good presentations.
B004U52VPS|1.0|\\"Boring!\\" is the combined opinion from my twin six-year old grandsons.      The boys love board games, card games, video games, and love the phone app \\"Angry Birds\\".  After playing this game for 25 minutes at the highest level, they put everything back into the box, closed it, and put it up (without being asked, too)!    I was very disappointed that it didn't hold their interest longer than 25 minutes and that I had spent so much money on it!

B00005N6KG|4.0|My Sony MDR-A34L headphones that came with my Walkman back in about 1991 were great and I kept using them long after the Walkman putzed out. I tried some other similar products over the years but kept coming back to the quality of the A34L's. The flimsy wires finally failed. I would have bought another pair, but sadly they are no longer available, so I got a pair of these MDR-W08L headphones. The Amazon price I paid was 22% less than MSRP.<br /><br />The sound quality on the WO8L's is definitely better over the higher frequencies, with noticeably better dynamic range. Lower frequency music like \\"heavy metal\\" rock sounded a (tiny) shade better on the old A34L's, but overall these W08L's are the best lightweight low cost headphones I have tried so far. Am very pleased with them. The only thing I don't like is that they are now making the cords 6 inches shorter and the wires are even thinner than before. Six inches may not sound like much, but when sitting at my desk working with the phones plugged into the headphone jack on my speakers I cannot move my head without ripping the wire, so I had to get an extension.<br /><br />The specs on the Amazon page were a tad wanting so I looked up them up on the Sony site and here they are (as of Aug 2011):<br /><br />Power:<br />  Power Handling Capacity : 50mW<br /><br />Weights and Measurements:<br />  Cord Length (Approx.) : 3.3 ft (1.0m)<br /><br />General:<br />  Magnet : Neodymium<br />  Plug : Nickel-plated, L-shaped stereo mini plug<br />  Headband : Slim<br />  Design : Over-the-head, Vertical In-the-ear<br />  Type of Use : Portable<br /><br />Hardware:<br />  Cord : TPC Y-shape<br />  Headphone Type : Open-air, Dynamic<br /><br />Audio:<br />  Frequency Response : 20Hz -20,000Hz<br />  Sensitivity : 104dB/mW<br />  Impedance : 16 ohms<br />  Driver Unit : 13.5mm<br /><br />Overall am very pleased with the sound quality and price, but due to the flimsy materials, I don't expect these to last nearly as long as my old ones. I may just get a couple more and toss them in a drawer for later use.
1933633867|3.0|*A full summary (and critique) of this book is available at newbooksinbrief dot com.<br /><br />The main argument: Debt is certainly a topic of deep interest and import these days, what with future prosperity seemingly threatened on all sides by a combination of personal, commercial, and national debt. A fact that has been brought home with particular poignancy in recent times by the role that debt played in the latest global financial crash of 2008, and the continuing threat of growing consumer debt and national debts in places such as Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and now Italy, and, of course, the US. According to Anthropologist David Graeber, author of the new book `Debt: The First 5000 Years', debt takes on an even larger significance when we trace its history, since this exercise allows us to gain a new and more complete understanding of economics as a whole, and our modern capitalist system in particular (not to mention several other aspects of the human condition to boot). The story of debt takes us from the origins of money itself; through to the age of slavery and conquest; on to the origins of the major world religions (with their near universal prohibitions on usury); through to the middle ages and the beginnings of capitalism and the modern banking system; and finally on to the modern age itself with its national currencies, central banks, and commitment to market capitalism.<br /><br />While this story is interesting in its own right, Graeber's main argument here is that tracing the history of debt unearths some uneasy truths and deep flaws in the nature of modern capitalism, and it is high time, he proposes, that we rekindle the conversation about how and with what we might replace it.<br /><br />Graeber's arguments that capitalism is essentially a corrupt and unsustainable economic system remain ultimately unconvincing. Nevertheless, it is clear that tracing the history of debt does add to our understanding of history, economics, modern capitalism, and indeed many other aspects of the human condition, and, as such, is a worthwhile project on this count alone.

B000FJGWBC|4.0|I'm not exactly sure that Peter Benchley's \\"The Deep\\" needed to be remade, it was after all made into an entertaining movie starring Nick Nolte, Louis Gossett, Jr., Robert Shaw and the impossibly beautiful Jacqueline Bisset in 1977. But, fans of Jessica Alba are no doubt glad that it did get the OK since it gave Hollywood a chance to put the admittedly stunning Alba in a bikini for an extended period of time, eye candy that saves this movie that would otherwise hold little interest other than to mull over replacing the Blu-ray of \\"Into the Blue\\" in my player with the vastly superior Blu-ray of \\"The Deep.\\"<br />\\"Into the Blue\\" is a familiar plot for everyone who has seen \\"The Deep,\\" and, if you haven't where have you been for the last three decades? An attractive young couple (replace Nolte with Walker and Bissett with Alba) are diving in the Caribbean when they come across a recently downed cargo plane that's packed with cocaine (vials of morphine in the book and \\"The Deep\\") which the two devise a plan to retrieve, much to the chagrin of some villainous characters.<br />Did I mention that the only real reason to see this movie is Alba? This fumbling remake is mediocrity at its most well, mediocre. The movie pales in comparison to its much better origin material and only the photography and the sight of Alba in that bikini help elevate it from the bottom of the Blu-ray collection.<br />So, how is the high definition Blu-ray in terms of video and audio quality, well - its actually pretty good and leagues ahead (pun intended) of its standard def DVD counterpart. The Blu-ray features a all-around good 1080p, 2.35:1-framed transfer which is sharp and bright. I mean if you want to marvel at Alba in a bikini, you want to in high def right?! Seriously though, the transfer is detailed with a wide array of colors with black tones good and skin tones natural.<br />The good news continues with the audio with \\"Into the Blue\\" featuring a terrific PCM 5.1 uncompressed soundtrack with the above water scenes (rather obviously) the more robust of the movie with a strong sense of depth. This is a very immersive track and certainly more than adequate for the movie.<br />The Blu-ray of \\"Into the Blue\\" features several special features with a serviceable audio commentary from Director John Stockwell leading the pack. I actually somewhat enjoyed this track because it provided a nice mix of anecdotal and technical information.<br />Next up is a 20-minute Diving Deeper 'Into the Blue' which I was surprised to find quite interesting with a good portion devoted to world of underwater filmmaking. Rounding out the extras are 10 deleted scenes (running almost 18 minutes) with optional commentary by Stockwell and 1080p trailers for \\"Stealth,\\" \\"Hitch,\\" and \\"xXx.\\"<br />\\"Into the Blue\\" is never going to be a good movie, despite the appreciable attributes on display of Ms. Alba, but it does feature good audio and video and the Blu-ray is recommended.

B002JVWR0Y|3.0|SPOILERS BELOW.<br /><br />This season really dissapointed me, although I understand the producers of a successfull show are always ina kind of CATCH 22 situation: if they keep the formula the same, hey risk that people say the show is always the same, no edge, etc. If they change it, people complain they changed it...<br /><br />So, that said, the producers had courage to change the tonality of the show, but it unfortunately backfired. Why?<br /><br />CONS:<br />a. Dexter simply is not Dexter anymore. He killed murderers that escaped the law. Now, with the proofs he had, he could easily have sent the police after Trinity and end the case. No. He decided he simply got to kill Trinity himself.<br /><br />b. The love plot with Batista and Angela is utterless boring, unconvinving, trite.<br /><br />c. Why on Earth the producers think it's the coolest thing in the world to have a character (Debra) whose main characteristic is to say the \\"f\\" word every time? It got boring.<br /><br />d. Quinn is going nowhere.<br /><br />e. The ending was atrocious, implausible, full of plot holes. To kill Rita (which was annoying, by the way, saying \\"Family is important\\" with mellow eyes about a hundred times per episode!) was shcok just for the sake of shock, not to advance plot or get new viewers. And it was unplausible. TRinity only got the chance to get her because she came back to get something for her son Harrison (as shown in the cell phone message). Trinity also would have had to work a lot faster than his previous crimes. All in all, it just doesn't fit.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Leading actor Hall continues to do a splendid job.
B000L212HW|5.0|The movie \\"Reign of Fire\\" remains one of my favorite movies. It has precisely the right balance of character and action to keep me engrossed in the proceedings. I had seen 1981's \\"Dragonslayer\\" at the cinema while growing up in the U.K. and had been wowed by the special effects - however, that dated effort (made before the advent of CGI) pales in comparison to the dragons that are on display in \\"Reign of Fire.\\" Here are dragons that are so lifelike, that you would almost believe that dragons exist.<br />The movie is largely set in Northumberland, though the Northumberland on display here looks nothing like the Northumberland I grew up in. It is a rugged outpost for human survivors of the dragon attacks and Christian Bale proves that his childhood performance in Spielberg's \\"Empire of the Sun\\" was no fluke. Before he would become internationally known as Batman, Bale was quietly appearing in a wide variety of film roles. Also a surprise is Matthew McConaughey who eschews his usual tame roles as an action hero. He plays Van Zan, a leader of American dragon slayers arriving in the U.K. to do battle with the dragons. The movie heats up (pun intended) along with the action.<br />So, how does this Blu-ray edition stack up to the previous DVD - extremely well in fact for one of the first movies to be released in the then fledgling format.<br />Disney lives up to its sterling standard with this flawless AVC codec transfer. Detail is exceptional with some terrific facial detail and those unfamiliar Northumberland rocky dwellings. The color palette is also pleasing with well balanced reds and oranges for the dragon's fire breathing and black levels unswervingly excellent. The previous DVD version looks lifeless and drab by comparison.<br />The audio quality on the disc is another standout effort which puts the subpar DVD release to shame. Disney have mixed this audio extremely well, delivering outstanding 5.1 PCM tracks with active and aurally exciting surround presentations. The audio track really comes to life as dragons fly from side to side and from front to back with such a 360° enveloping that it needs to be heard to be believed. This track will put your surround system to the test.<br />Toss out that low definition DVD because all the special features from that release have been ported over to the Blu-ray, in addition to a Blu-ray exclusive 1080p HD trailer for the movie. Included on this release of \\"Reign of Fire\\" is the previously released \\"Breathing Life into the Terror,\\" and \\"If You Can't Take the Heat\\" in addition to the rather dry audio commentary by director Rob Bowman (who spends too much time in my opinion on the technical side of the production) and the original theatrical trailer.

030745455X|4.0|This is a fast-moving action-packed suspense murder mystery thriller.  If you saw the movie The Transporter in 2002, starring Jason Statham, you remember the opening car chase scene.  Your heart begins to beat faster.  The body temperature rises.  Your joints feel weak.  A dull pain begins to rise in the front of your head, around the nose and eyes.  You are riveted, and mesmerized by the action.  You stop caring that the whole thing is more than improbable.  It is unbelievable!  But you keep watching as the scene takes you past car wrecks and close calls, people flying this way and that.  It's James Bond on steroids.  Holy Cow!<br /><br />This book is reminiscent of that film, because of the pace, and of the plot.  The story centers on the investigation of a sex trafficking operation.  There are two main characters, one is Lisbeth Salander, a rail-thin young woman, with a dragon tattoo, who is really good with computers, but abysmally bad with people.  The other is Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist working for a monthly magazine.  In a murder mystery the plot is self-evident, and summarizing it quite pointless.<br /><br />My take on the book is that it is worth reading for anybody who considers themselves book lovers.  I would say the same thing about The Godfather to anybody who loves movies.  Go ahead, read it and enjoy the adrenalin rush!<br /><br />Remember, this is the second book in a trilogy, so you may want to read The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo before jumping on this roller-coaster.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|When I was younger, I had all kinds of time to read...fast-forward 20 years, add in a full-time job, self-employment on the side, and a family, and luxurious stretches of time to knock out a book or two have fallen WAY by the wayside. Enter \\"Bossypants\\". To be honest, I don't even feel like I have time to write a review (I might be typing this at work! lol), but I feel compelled because I want to make your life better. Yes, reading this book will make your life better. At least it did for mine. (translation: don't try to sue me because it did not, in fact, make your life better)    I laughed at almost every single page. Out loud. I read the entire book in under two days, and that included doing all of the above-mentioned life duties in between. As soon as it ended, I started thinking about who I wanted to lend the book to, so they could share in my happy-life experience. I chose one of my sisters, and then was immediately sad when I handed the book over, because I wanted to read it again.    Just do it. Buy the book. You'll be so happy!
0786955716|1.0|The box implies rooftops galore to actually make a \\"top down\\" city/village plan with streets and buildings identified by their rooftops.  Instead you get tiles that only loosely resemble interiors with some accents that are pretty nice I suppose.  No town squares.  No rooftops.  Your best bet is to go with Fat Dragon's village tiles.  You can pick them up cheap at rpgnow.com.    I must add that I really enjoy the other tile sets.  I use them often.  This one missed the mark by a mile however.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This blu ray set does not include the Original Theatrical Trilogy, so it is therefore incomplete.  Yes, these movies have been remastered in HD, and there are hours of special features, but that is not enough to compensate for the lack of the theatrical versions (the missing ingredient).  We have waited patiently for years, and we will continue to do so until the OTT is released.  Let this serve as a reminder to you, George Lucas, that you have still not given the fans what we want.  And to potential buyers, I suggest you hold on to your $90.00 until the OTT is released on blu ray.  Believe me, it will be well worth the wait.
B001UV4XHY|2.0|So dark that you can't see the movie--must be the computer generation uses no light so the first 40 minutes of the movie are so dark that you can't see it.  I'm sure it would be good if it wasn't in total darkness.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I've never read the comic book; so I knew nothing about the story of Thor. But, the movie was fantastic, nevertheless. Avatar is my favorite movie, and this one isn't far behind. Sci-fi in its finest.
0375842209|4.0|It's like, you know something's bad gonna happen if \\"Death\\" is narrating but you keep reading anyway. It's like your perception of WWII and Holocaust is one-sided- the Jews and the minorities are the victims and not the rest. This keeps you in prespective that those times were terrible times and it doesn't really matter which side the story is. I'm 27 years old and I have fairly read books in wide range of genre from fantasy novels to mystery to poignant novels and love stories with historical background and I must say that The Book Theif stands on it's own. It's expected the characters' experience would get worse per page but it becomes a mixture of good and bad and that makes it great. In the end, you are happy that Leisel survived and lived a very long life and yet you don't feel victorious ,for the fact that her loss of the people she loved was not justified in any way.
B0000029GA|5.0|Illmatic....has to be the best rap album of all time.  People say NAS fell off, people dont realize as God as he is on the mic..people grow up, change up, and always find different ways of communicating their craft. Unfortunately for NAS, people relate this part of his life to great music and other parts of his life as something that cannot be compared. He has musically raised the bar in so many ways. Every Album he came out with has a new bar raised where he just throws in components and themes like no one else.  Rewind, One Mic, Sekou Story, Dance (musical as his voice), I Know I can (Mozart)m Who Killed It, ....its just crazy how overlooked this guy is.    Has anyone heard Distant Relatives with Marley? That is just so classic..only the strong will continue..      In any event, NAS might not be pop like Jay and them, and thats probably why artists like NAS will never have to worry about their fan base.    Form Illmatic to Untitled...all very good material.
B000069AUH|2.0|As my topic states, I write to discuss this album on vinyl, not the content of it, as I love this album.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the pressing leaves much to be desired. Perhaps it was not best treated by the girlfriend I received it from, but it does not have deep grooves and gets much popping and has a shallower sound because of it. The quality of the sound of this record is very much near the bottom of my new (not used purchases) vinyl.
B000N4SHPS|3.0|Viewed: 5/08, 8/11<br />Rate: 6<br /><br />5/08: Much better than I anticipated and even exceeded my expectations, I thought Rocky Balboa was going to be the worst Rocky movie in the series, even worse than Rocky V (it's still a painful to think about it). Lo and below, Rocky Balboa is back and charms his way throughout the picture. I've not had so much fun, and I love the whole package. What Sylvester Stallone brought to Rocky Balboa is the old memories and characters. At the same time, he merges his past with the present, showing no hard feelings or bitterness about how things are different and/or changed. He just has a different perspective on them, and interestingly, Rocky Balboa is old school meets new school, just a real nice fresh change for a turn. The editing work is unlike the crap I see nowadays with an interesting back-and-forth of the natural, part of the film and the fight show. I like that. Sylvester Stallone (whose best acting bit is when he gives the speech to his son before he goes back in the restaurant) is phenomenal playing Rocky again, and it's the role that he was born to play. Everybody else is great also. It's too bad not seeing Talia Shire again, but actually her death contributes a great deal to the story and makes Rocky Balboa to work. A real good asset indeed. Another thing I like about the story of Rocky Balboa is how Stallone combines the juvenile mentality of ESPN (you know, the crap about who is the best and the fictional versus thing that dominates the show instead of showing some real sports) and the need for Rocky to come back and actually fight. It makes total sense, and the fight is awesome. The best part...well, there is so many of them in the movie, but the best part is how Rocky Balboa ended. It shows how much we know that Rocky didn't care about the fight result but the actual result of winning the true fight. That display shows what is more important, and Sylvester Stallone does that admirably well. That's why I loved the movie. The feeling that I get out of Rocky Balboa is more jubilant, emotional, and refreshing than I've felt for a long time. I always think of a movie that could be made in sort of \\"back to the old times again\\" in a \\"where are they now?\\" And Sylvester Stallone does just exactly that. Mike Tyson trashing-talking with the current champion is hilarious, reminding me of the press news conference post-melee where Iron Mike yells at Lennox Lewis, \\"You scared coward. You ain't a man enough to **** with me.\\" All in all, Rocky Balboa is a great, inspiring feel-good movie that is almost (I'm wincing over that rap song for Mason Dixon's entrance) completely free of anything that's improper and brings back the memories again to the point that I feel like I want to watch the whole series all over again and relive that \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" scene atop of the steps in front of the Philadelphia Art Museum (now moved back to below next to the steps). This film deserves a `10'.<br /><br />8/11: I am going to lower my rating of Rocky Balboa from `10' to `6'. To be honest with you, it's just not a very good film. Of course, it is filled with memories, but we can always watch first five pictures to relive them. So, what is the point? It is hard to for me to stomach Robert Balboa, a whelping that needs to be beaten up by Rocky to set his priorities straight. Also, it gets pretty tiresome to see Paulie making the same, usual complaints. If he is going to be like that, why should I bother to care? Then, Rocky goes into several different directions at once, letting the film to have no real clarity what the message intends to be. In short, not much really happens in the film. The most atrocious aspect of it is the camera work. Does the cameraman suffer from a bad case of arthritis? At least the fight at the end is the best part of Rocky Balboa. All in all, time for the Rocky series to die for once and all.eling that I get out of Rocky Balboa is more jubilant, emotional, and refreshing than I've felt for a long time.

B004NJW976|3.0|This is minimally enjoyable.  It's not bad but it's far from antyhing I'd recommend or go out of my way to play more often.  I enjoy lots of his music - this album seems to flow in the mix of his music that is abstract music.  It's nice but nothing great.
B00127RAJY|5.0|After I had my first baby I still had an extra 20pds that would not come off.  So I got this DVD b/c I am in LOVE with Jillian and her no nonense attitude toward working out and I saw how many great reviews it had on Amazon.  This DVD got me into the best shape of my life.  I dropped more than 20pds, and became very strong and toned.  I would start to do the DVD while watching something on TV b/c it can get a little tedious after awhile doing the same thing over and over for weeks on weeks but its short and simple and gets results.  Its hard to argue yourself out of a 20min workout.  This is worth the $10 and worth your time.  You will feel your body get stronger and stronger by the day.  I just had my second baby and need to lose another 15-20pds again :( and I just started the 30days, I am on day 5 today and my body is GOOD sore every morning and I feel my body getting back into shape.  I hope it has the same results the second time around.
0553801473|2.0|After a 5 year wait, A Feast for Crows was a turgid disappointment.  Martin claimed the second half of the book (A Dance With Dragons) was already written and hopefully would be published in a year.  Instead, it was a 6 year wait. (Did that set some sort of record?) I wasn't going to bother reading this book, since there is no way I can recall all the secondary and tertiary characters and story lines, but I was enticed by the great HBO television series and changed my mind.<br /><br />Well, that was a mistake.  A Dance With Dragons is another disappointment.  A frustrating barrage of vaguely familiar names and plot lines caused me to give up about 30% of the way through on Kindle.  I couldn't sleep one night, so I picked up the book again and forced myself to keep reading, and fortunately the story picked up.<br /><br />Aside from all the forgotten characters and plots, the problem is that nothing much of interest happens.  Stories left dangling 6 years ago, and some instances 11 years ago, are still dangling. Of interest, Martin offers up yet another possibility for Jon Snow's true parentage, and shows that maybe some of those characters you thought he gleefully killed off aren't really dead after all.<br /><br />If you gave me a summary of important events in this book, it wouldn't fill up a single page, and I could skip reading this book and wait (or not) for the next book to come out in, what? another year? or 6 years maybe?
B002CCNC90|5.0|Is a excellent book a great writer too, keep you interested every word, I readed in spanish and i'm too sad because kindle didnt have it in spanish, now i'm very happy and buy it inmediatly, I recomend read this book for everyone, don't be sorry.
1401229921|4.0|Honestly speaking, I don't think I will ever consider Batman: Hush to be a good story arc. I mainly bought the original colored version for Jim Lee's artwork. I mean who wouldn't be excited for a Jim Lee's Batman. Of course, a solid story would've been a great bonus. But not here, the storyline is pretty much an excuse for Jim Lee to draw most of Batman's rogue gallery. Joker, The Riddler, The Scarecrow, Killer Croc, Catwoman, Poison Ivy, even Superman are featured here. And the titular new villain character Hush has really one of the most convoluted backgrounds among Bat-villains (not in a good way). There is really no character study nor deep here. It's just Batman and his sidekicks in one visually stunning situation after another. If you're looking for solid storytelling, look elsewhere.<br /><br />That being said this Hush: Unwrapped edition is really the kind of book that I'd been waiting for. Being an aspiring penciler and line art afficionado myself, it is just very inspiring to see how painstaking and richly detailed Lee's penciled pages are. I could spend hours and hours just savoring the art. I still love the colored comic books but I do hope there would be more books like this in the future. I hope Marvel can follow suit. I mean, for a teasing, how about a Todd McFarlane's Spider-Man: Torment being published in this format? Or Jim Lee's X-Men works? Fingers crossed on those.
0385339585|5.0|This by far is my favorite Grisham novel.  I could say a movie would be great, but I know a production of this would be quite expensive.  Thats probably why this could be a real story.  A story of greed is very well presented and really shows how it turns family members against each other.  I liked the descriptions of the jungle in Brazil. I could not put this book down, I read it in less than three days.

B000OCY7JE|5.0|How can a story with a wedding, a reuniting and a humanitarian be dark and depressing? In that wonderful Danish film way, that's how. There were moments I thought I knew exactly where this movie was going. I was wrong. No tidy endings--and no dismissing it as solely bleak either. Once again, Mads Mikkelson leads a strong cast in a story that lets us see how the same man can be both strong and weak, both caring and distant. A compelling film with the ability to make a person think about the meanings of family, obligation and relationships.
B00004R99I|5.0|No matter how old it is, VHS is still a great bargain and the movies are still amazing!! Pocahontas is my favorite Disney movie and I was thrilled to find a great deal on this. :)
0307272702|2.0|Taubes is a sloppy writer. Everything he has to say in this book can be written in less than 10 pages. However, 10 pages does not a book make. That is very clear soon after starting reading.    What he says is important and I don't mean to minimize that. If I were to condense what he's saying into one sentence without supporting concepts it would be, \\"the only way to lose weight and keep it off is with a low carbohydrate diet.\\" The reason I say that it could be written in 10 pages is supporting concepts for this statement requires some writing space.    Go to any bookstore, take the book off the shelf, read the few pages in chapter 15, and you've read the book.
0545259088|5.0|FOREVER (The Wolves of Mercy Falls #3) is a well done end to a beautifully written series that left me with a feeling of warmth and satisfaction; even with many questions still not quite answered... and strange as it may be, I'm ok with that.<br /><br />I'd say this third and final installment is a better read then LINGER was, bringing back all the emotions that were so present and all encompassing with SHIVER, book one and truly taking the reader full circle, as any good conclusion book should.  All the previous lesser characters return throughout here and there, making their appearances whether in person in memory. There is a lot of Sam in this book and a good amount of Cole (yay!), Grace and Isabel are definitely in attendance, but not as much as the boys.  This might just be the most emotional book out of the three and be prepared, not everyone survives.<br /><br />Although from the reviews I've seen, many fans are disappointed by the ending, I was not. In my opinion Maggie Stiefvater did an excellent job taking a less then realistic idea like werewolves and making it almost plausible. The fact that everything didn't exactly turn out roses for everyone involved just made it more believable, because that's not reality and I appreciate Stiefvater for that. Sometimes it's nice to have a little \\"dot, dot, dot.\\"  And I'm content with FOREVER having an ending open to possibilities, which I felt was especially fitting in this series.
B004USLWVE|5.0|The case is an excellent addition for my travels.  Not only was I able to carry my equipment, but there was enough room for me to also carry a number of essentials that I needed for our hike in the Colorado Rockies.      I would highly recommend this bag for serious camera buffs.  Other than the high price, this is a great case.

1602830452|5.0|I AM A HUGE SHERLOCK HOLMES FAN AND I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS CD COLLECTION.<br />I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT THE PRICE,BUT AFTER LISTENING TO THE ENTIRE COLLECTION,<br />I CAN SAY IT IS WORTH IT.
0061353248|3.0|I am not one to write negative reviews for books, this is about as low as I will go but I really was puzzled about the hype of this book. My major complaint is with the complete overkill of almost every single experiment and topic he discusses. I really believe this book could have been one hundred pages shorter and we would all have gotten the same amount of education and insight from it. My next problem is most of his points of our irrational behavior is to simplistic. When he has one variable for a situation there are so many other things we think about when processing our decisions. For instance I think it was his first example where he tells us people he surveyed would drive 15 minutes to save $7 on a $20 ink pen but the same people won't drive 15 minutes to save $7 on a $450 suit. He claims that is irrational. But is it? Last time I bought a suit it took over 3 hours so the $7 savings actually would take 3 hours and 15 minutes. I buy nice ink pens almost weekly and the process is usually very quick so the time is more accurate in that situation. That is one small example of how this book is to simplified to have any credibility.<br /><br />On a more positive note he does give you some food for thought and I love that he is breaking away from the crazy economist belief in that people always make rational decisions and those who don't the system corrects for. The world will be in a much better position when that is a belief of the past. When he is not beating a topic to death the author does of a good sense of humor in his voice. I would not read this book again but I am glad I did. If you have nothing that you are dying to read and need this as a filler until you come across something better I think this book will fill that role.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|This film was well done. Without ever once bringing religion into it, it covered the discussion of Free Will vs Destiny as it relates to two people in love.<br /><br />Someone may quibble over the one mention of angels but seriously not once did I feel like any one was proselytizing for any viewpoint over another. Delightfully refreshing in this time of polarization and fanatacism.<br /><br />Watch it and decide for your self. I plan to buy this one for my library.
B003Y5H53S|1.0|I was not happy with this movie wish I had not spent the money..The plot drags along too slow and its like torture continuing to watch it.

0553801473|5.0|This book will be disappointing for those who wished to have all their questions answered in book 5 of a 7 book series. I for one really enjoyed it. After 14 years of reading this series I have learned to be patient and it served me well in this book. The violent action is much sparser than in Storm of Swords but the violence that does take place is extremely disconcerting as are the graphic sex scenes. The book has tons of \\"omg\\" and \\"wow that was cool\\" moments but they mostly take place in the last 300 pages aside from a few in the beginning.<br /><br />I just finished the book last night and I am very satisfied for now. Hopefully we won't have to wait 6 years for the next book but if we do then it will just be that much sweeter.(less)
0756405890|5.0|The Name of the Wind. Good book, or best book? I think the choice is clearly the latter. You will not find a better novel. The Kingkiller Chronicles first installment is only trumped by it's own sequel. In this day and age of sequels and lack of originals, we find that NOTW is a diamond shining so bright Cecil Rhodes would be afraid to pick it up. The book is fantasy lit fans dream come true. Go buy it right now. NOW! Have your friends read it. You will not be disappointed(neither will your friends, now that I think about it).
B000AMJC2K|5.0|Before I got this arm, I had my ViewSonic VX2250WM-LED over a Fellowes printer stand (believe or not).  I had that since I'm 6.1\\" and to have the monitor just over my desk made my neck to hurt 'cause I had to lean a little bit.  The stand worked fine, but it wasn't \\"good looking\\" over my desk and took a lot of space over it.  I found this Ergotron arm in amazon.com and after reading the reviews I purchased it and I'm totally satisfied with the investment.<br /><br />I got rid of the printer stand, now I have the monitor over this great looking and strong built arm and even I got it to to be at a better hight level, couldn't be more happy with this.  Read the other 5 star reviews, they're not liying.
0756404738|5.0|Simply put: the best just got better. In the greatest follow up in history, Pat does it again. The book was so good, I could not put it down, despite the fact that I had to eat, sleep, work, etc. A plot worth the old fantasy greats, a character more real than most of the people I work with, witty dialogue. I can't explain this correctly. Nothing compares to the sheer amount of joy, excitement,(and yes, sadness) that I got from reading this book. In other cases I may have named certain parts of the book contributery to It's level of awesome. But I fear that would ruin the fun for those who have yet to read the best book I've ever read. My only question is: when an we expect book three?
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I was SO excited to see this set available! I taped it live from the tv back in 1985 but with commercials and network interruptions, I missed a lot. Although I have some performances that are not on this dvd set, it is still an excellent representation of the concert. The quality is great and I like how the menus are set up to choose to play all or by artist or location. It also has a lot of extras such as the Band Aid video and a documentary. This is a must have for any music fan, especially if you remember watching it back then!
B003777QYQ|5.0|This is an awesomely magnificent book. Whatever opinions you may have regarding his fiction novels, suspend them all and read this as if peeping into the life of a professional writer. Stephen King is an all-time bestselling novelist and some beautiful movies have been made from his books too (The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption, The Shining,  come to mind immediately). I can understand that genre fiction is looked down upon by some elitists and reading horror stories may not be everyone's fare. But this book has got nothing to do with any of that. This book proves that Stephen King is an immensely great, accomplished and successful storyteller.    There are good forewords to this book, 3 of them actually, where King (I will call him King because he is one) explains how he came to write this book. Nothing to do with his own success in the craft but because he needs to clarify the art and craft of storytelling.    The book is not an autobiography.

He even recounts the very personal account of his struggle with alcoholism and drug abuse. He overcame those addictions and gave up cigarette smoking as well.    But all this is just a background, a buildup toward how he became a professional writer and maintained his success.    The book continues and reveals his thoughts on the process of writing. This reveals his process of writing based on his ideas that come to him from paying attention to the story when the story presents itself. He says the story is not made, the story makes itself. He mentions how he comes up with a unique situation and lets his characters thrive in the situation, thus surprising himself with a story which he discovers as a writer transcribing the goings on in the situation and the characters in them. He likens this process to unravelling a fossil in the ground. He does not approve plotting and writing to the plots restrictions. He compares the plot to a jackhammer being used to excavate a fossil, preferring instead to take time with a writers basic tools to excavate the delicate fossil which is the story idea. He doesn't know how his stories will end until he writes the final word.    He discusses and gives examples of various stages of writing and getting it published. This may not be a comprehensive guide on everything there is to know about writing but it paints for us a clear picture through his vast experience in the field of the craft.    In the last few chapters King shares his painful experience of getting hit by a van. Serious injuries he sustained and his thought process at the time are mentioned in detail. The description ispowerful and emotional and makes you feel as if you are witnessing it all right in front of you.    There is more than enough positivity and encouragement and wisdom in this book - it should get you started and motivated to pen your own epic. You can even see this book as a fine non-fiction to enrich your life, not just a book on the art of writing.

1439156816|5.0|This is an awesomely magnificent book. Whatever opinions you may have regarding his fiction novels, suspend them all and read this as if peeping into the life of a professional writer. Stephen King is an all-time bestselling novelist and some beautiful movies have been made from his books too (The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption, The Shining,  come to mind immediately). I can understand that genre fiction is looked down upon by some elitists and reading horror stories may not be everyone's fare. But this book has got nothing to do with any of that. This book proves that Stephen King is an immensely great, accomplished and successful storyteller.    There are good forewords to this book, 3 of them actually, where King (I will call him King because he is one) explains how he came to write this book. Nothing to do with his own success in the craft but because he needs to clarify the art and craft of storytelling.    The book is not an autobiography. It is full of entertaining anecdotes that lead up to how he became who he is. I love anecdotal books (such as Surely you are joking Mr. Feynman!

B000KJU1HI|4.0|I think this is a real and true piece of the 1960s, a decade that has always been quite mythologized for me by my folks. It captures a crucial moment in the shifting tide and in that sense, I'd say its on par with the film 'the Beatles First U.S. Visit' and could almost be watched in succession.<br /><br />That being said I most like that in many ways its NOT a rose-colored glasses view of anything. Its just a low-key piece following a young charming and developing musical poet/genius. Who at times also comes across as an arrogant, shifty little jerk. Bob sort of does become a character in his own movie, LIVING through adulation with isolation.<br /><br />The press is probing obsessively, wanting  what he thinks, what he believes, what he feels, what this lyric means, what that lyric means... \\"Yonder stands your orphan with his gun, crying like a fire in the sun, look out the saints are coming through\\" ...it all sounds like prophecy, almost Biblical in the emotional weight and urgency of the words. The usual techniques of the press were useless against Bob though, who seems determined to give them as few useable sound bytes to help them write their articles or satisfy their cravings as he could - no matter what the press or the fans are talkin' he sounds bored and uninterested in explaining himself as an artist.<br /><br />I don't believe he ever at any point comes off as warm in this film, EXCEPT in the performance footage. Here, his personal motivations become irrelevant - in concert halls, in hotel rooms, in dressing rooms, backstage, its Dylan singing these words simply because he can, and because he needs to - both raw and polished at the same time. Raw in that the music was still in the intimate realm of a six-string and a voice to stir the emotions. Polished in that Dylan had already mastered the form and is clearly looking to expand. Set all this against the icy cold financial assessing of Albert Grossman and Columbia Records - the former carrying himself as a kind of Colonel Tom Parker for the folk scene - and Dylan's cynicism is more easily understood. The dual nature of his musical form was that he was in business - what he did was as much a product as any in that matter. And while the content of the scene was changing, obviously some things never changed.<br /><br />See for me, Dylan might sound like an empty jerk at times. But he also sounds like a 24 year old kid. Someone who had barely coped with adolescence and now had to make sense of the strangeness of the world around him. In that I think he truly was the unwilling voice of a generation. There's no empty politics here - just Bob Dylan capturing the times in music and D.A. Pennebaker capturing them in reels. For a more expansive and grander look at Bob in the 60s look no further than Martin Scorsese's 'No Direction Home'. And for more on the humble beginnings of, what I might term, the cataclysmic cultural shift of the 60s, check out the first half of the documentary 'Berkeley in the Sixties'.m Parker for the folk scene - and Dylan's cynicism is more easily understood.

1439153663|5.0|I was shocked to hear this was the author's first novel. I loved her writing style as well as the story. Now that I've finished, I feel an emptiness from 'missing' the characters I came to know and love.   I highly recommend this story as an audiobook - the two women who do the voices (primarily the voices of Lavinia and Belle) are outstanding. My own imagination could have never done the characters justice.  There were a few times I thought the storyline was too depressing and upsetting (nature of the topic of course) but I'm glad I pushed through. Now, having finished the story, I feel every word was important.  An earlier comment mentioned that Belle's chapters were too short. I didn't think so. Lavinia is the primary storyteller and the 'Belle Chapters' provide a quick recap but from another point of view usually illuminating new facts and opinions and giving the reader a much better understanding. (but wow, you really must hear it in Belle's voice -- get the audiobook!!!)
B004Y1USV2|5.0|Excelente disco. Con 19 años compré Drama. Cuando vi que no estaban Jon Anderson ni Rick Wakeman, pensé que era el final del grupo. Con todo, el disco me pareció mucho mejor que el anterior, Tormato. Luego, la reconversión de Cinema en Yes hizo que sacaran una serie de discos en los que, a pesar de estar Jon Anderson, el sonido ochentero hizo que para mi Yes dejaran de interesarme. Volví a ellos con la publicación de Keys to Ascension y desde entonces siempre ha sido una frustración, viendo como se debatían entre el intento de mantener la comercialidad de la etapa Rabin y volver, de una forma bastante poco inspirada,a glorias pasadas. Algunos temas se salvaban mientras que otros se hundían sin remisión.  Este disco marca lo que debió ser la continuidad lógica de Drama si, en lugar de embarcarse en tan comercial aventura, hubiesen seguido la evolución lógica de una musica que ofrecía muchos kilates. Este disco es Yes, puro Yes. Me importa un bledo si no está Jon Anderson como me daba igual que estuviera cantando en discos como Big Generator. Las composiciones son inspiradísimas y, sino fuera por la evolución de los tiempos y por que el progresivo hoy en día no deja de ser una pieza de museo, este disco se colocaría por derecho propio entre los grandes discos de Yes. No mejor, evidentemente, que el período Yes Album-Going for the One, pero, a mi juicio, bastante superior a Tormato y similar a Drama. ¿Les parece poco?

Love it!<br /><br />I did try it out with Google SketchUp, and it worked fine there too.<br /><br />The spacenavigator is lightweight, and very responsive.  The only thing that concerns me is the seemingly flimsy usb plugin cord.  It seems that with as much moving around, packing it up in its storage case and unpacking over and over, that it may wear the cord out, or at least the part where the cord connects with the navigator.  Since this is a product for notebooks, it is not going to be sitting stationary for long periods of time.
B001QWBM62|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1KYEG09GPAKJN]]The video is from my recent vacation in Cape Cod, MA.  We took a boat out to the outer beach, and there were seals everywhere!  I managed to get my camera out of my bag with my other hand while recording the seals.  The audio is straight from the H4n, I only did a little of compression to smooth out some transients.<br /><br />I'm a Sound Design student at Savannah College of Art and Design, most of my Sound Professors have said that carrying around a portable recorder is a great way to getting in the habit of recording, and getting great sounds.<br /><br />I've had the H4n for about 5-6 months now an I'm loving it.  I would suggest anyone looking to buy one to get the wired remote.  The buttons on the H4n are a little clicky, and they can be heard on the recording if your adjusting levels on the fly.  The remote has soft silent buttons, and the LED will flash if you are clipping.<br /><br />Overall I'm really enjoying my H4n an I'm looking forward to all the great sounds I'll record in the future with it.
0756404738|3.0|My brother recommended this book, (The Name of the Wind, actually). I read The Name of the Wind and found it interesting, so I thought I might as well read this one. The plot is interesting and Kvothe's dynamic character captivates my attention for the most. Rothfuss keeps me intrigued to how Kvothe is going to turn the negative in to a positive with his benevolent tactics. However, I find the story very, very slow that I came across many parts of the story where it bored me so much I almost want to just stop reading. I would actually try to list all the boring, uninteresting and pointless parts, but there's a reason I'm giving it a 3 not a 2. Aside from the slow progression of Kvothe's story, I am also very disappointed by the way Rothfuss focused Kvothe's story on the parts that seems insignificant: \\"the stories within the story.\\" It's frustrating to read this book because I'd get very interested in Kvothe's on going battle with Ambrose, his relationship with Denna, and him ACTUALLY learning about the name of the wind. But everytime any of these parts come up, it's either just a quick brush and too early cut off and it won't be mentioned until 200 pages later. In other words, it kept me hanging TOO MUCH, like its forgotten, so I just lost interest. I honestly think the story lacks excitement, consistency and other characters' perceptions.     Don't get me wrong. Though I didn't think this book was as decent as the first installment, It's still worth the reading. It's better than most fantasy series. In fact, I almost felt guilty about writing this review. Almost.

B00003CXRM|5.0|Wildly imaginative retelling of Homer's Odyssey from the ever-unpredictable Coen brothers, who transfer the classic poem to depression-era Mississippi.  Included are clever references to the Cyclops, Sirens, Lotus-eaters and many more.<br /><br />Dapper, smooth talking Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney) breaks free from a road gang with his two dim-witted partners to whom he is chained (John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson).  Together the trio sets out on an epic journey across the state to retrieve a fortune before it is drowned beneath the waters of a man-made lake that will be created by the completion of a dam.  Along the way they encounter a crooked Bible salesman, corrupt politicians, a blues guitarist who has sold his soul to the Devil, a tommy-gun-toting gangster, and the Ku Klux Klan, all the while recording a hit record that tops the country charts.<br /><br />Beautifully photographed in a sepia -colored haze, chock full of traditional bluegrass music, brilliantly written and directed by the Coens, who  elicit wonderful performance from the three leading actors, as well as supporting players like John Goodman, Holly Hunter and Charles Durning.<br /><br />This is one of those love `em or hate `em movies .  Give it a shot.  It's hard to guess which camp you'll fall into.
B00070Q8DQ|4.0|Demigod has a nice theme going throughout the album. The first song, \\"Sculpting The Throne Ov Seth\\", starts off with an acoustic guitar fading in, using a unique riff. Granted, the riff has been used in other songs before, but never have I heard it on an acoustic. The acoustic ends shortly, with the rest of the band entering immediately. The drums have it hardest in this because of how fast it's going. That shift from acoustics to the band leads to them all playing an extreme melody. What comes next is a mid tempo chorus (excluding the drums, who, basically, have sixteenth notes through the song). It continues this for the entire song, letting up towards the end, only to have an intense guitar solo. When this finishes, the drums go back to the sixteenth notes, with everybody ending in a climax.    The second song, \\"Demigod\\", is actually connected to \\"Sculpting The Throne Ov Seth\\". When \\"Demigod\\" starts up, you can hear the guitars still fading from before. Underneath, you can hear trumpets, with a march - like riff, everyone playing. It then turns to more of a \\"Behemoth\\" tune, drums going faster than comprehendible, and everyone doing something interesting with what their playing. After a few minutes, there is a mid - tempo break, then an epic riff with the drums doing an impressive beat, then the beginning. Another verse and chorus later, this monster of a song ends with some impressive drumming and guitar playing.     Next one the album is \\"Conquer All\\". I actually found this album with this song. I found the song while scathing through some music videos on YouTube, and when I heard the beginning, I was blown away. Not only is it the best song on the album (\\"Slaves Shall Serve\\" close behind it), it differs from the rest of the album. It reminded me of an epic war up until the guitar break. At this moment, the guitar whips out a solo from out of nowhere, with the drums speeding up to, what sounds like, triplets. Then onward, the drums do some \\"solos\\" (I say \\"solos\\"because they last but two or three seconds. Still impressive, though). The song stops after this.    Next up was \\"Nephilim Rising\\", starting off like the rest of the songs: fast. Nothing real special about this track, until about twenty - five seconds after you start it. All the instruments start as the other songs (with variation, of course), whereas the drums take a break on the kick pedals, doing a simple beat for the verse (simple, looking at the rest of the album). What follows is unusual for a Behemoth chorus - It slows down. This song keeps the same pace through the song. To me, it's nice to have a slower song after what was before. I love any death metal, but even I need a break. But it speeds up for the Guitar solo, probably the most impressive solo for all the instruments in the album. It stops abruptly, with an acoustic and Spanish guitar rounding the song out. You wouldn't expect this from Behemoth, seeing as the rest of the songs are faster then this. It's no doubt one of the best off the album.    Behemoth kicks it back up with \\"Towards Babylon\\". It starts out with breakneck speeds, probably the fastest from the song. It keeps the same thing going for a while. It doesn't get boring, no, with the chorus following fast behind. This song's pace and abrupt drum break make wonder why other bands don't do something like this. The song keeps going without a break.    Next is \\"Before Aeons Came\\". It's short, but has a lot of talents stirred into the two minutes and fifty eight seconds. The singer goes higher in this song than the other songs. There is a lot of fast - going beats in this, kind of like an epic journey to somewhere even better than the journey there. I would say this song is probably the most unique song, with the singer and drums doing things that make my love for Behemoth stronger.     Next is \\"Mysterium Coniunctionis (Hermanubis)\\". Lord knows if the title is some language I have yet to learn, or some random gibberish mixed together. Probablyboth. It starts rather slow, but after a few seconds (literally) it picks up with the drums leading like an emperor who is trying to take the world over. This song has the singer going a little high, too. I can't quite find the pattern in this song, but I know it's there. After two minutes, the drums take up a beat that no other song in the album has done or did. It reverts back to its verse, but quickly changes to a guitar solo of high talent to pull off. It fades after a few measures, leaving you in want for more.    The next track is \\"XUL\\", having some gravity blasts and fast guitar playing before the first few seconds are gone. It goes back and forth until the chorus, something I didn't expect with this song. It leaves that for another verse, giving the drummer something to really play. It's downright ridiculous at this point. Everyone is pulling out all the stops to make you musically happy, but it just makes me wonder \\"how can man be this fast?\\" It gives the last few seconds to silence, then goes the next song.    The second to last songs is one of those \\"in your face\\" kind of songs: \\"Slaves Shall Serve\\". I gave reference to this song earlier in the \\"Conquer All\\" review. It starts of with a low note and the singer saying something (I couldn't make it out), then just shatters the dreams of people who like music the average person can play. The playing and talent it must have taken to write and perform this song is amazing. It gives you a verse and a chorus, and then breaks for more extreme playing. It does a somewhat slower break, but blasts back to a verse, then a guitar solo I will forever love. The last few seconds end with everyone going insane, and the singer screaming what the title of the song is. If you even give a hint of thought of you being able to recreate something like this, you're sadly mistaken.    The round - out song is \\"The Reign Ov Shemsu-Hor\\", having the first two minutes play something people can actually play. But the last six minutes iswhat you expect: fast drumming, menacing guitar playing, insane bass playing, and deep, growl - like singing. This song is just madness, even for Sparta. Behemoth out did themselves with this song. Something I will cherish for years to come, \\"The Reign Ov Shemsu-Hor\\" is something I personally believe you and your friends can agree on. At the seven minute mark, it turns to a more melodic sound, with the singer less audible, and everyone else turned up a notch. After eight minutes and twenty six seconds, Behemoth ends this incredible album.    This is a definite buy if you have the money and the taste of music. It's not perfect, but it's close.

B001HNE3NO|4.0|From the first page you will be drawn into this story.  I liked the pacing as the author alternates chapters between Sarah's story of 1942 and Julia's story of 2002. I agree there is some lagging when we no longer join Sarah in the past.  I was only slightly familiar with the Vel d'Hiv roundup.  The author's use of this event as a backdrop for her horrific and touching tale was very creative.  Overall, I enjoyed this book and will seek out the movie version starring Kristin Scott Thomas.
1402210086|4.0|Kitty Charing has been brought up by her rich guardian, Matthew Penicuik. Out of the blue, Matthew decides to name Kitty as his heiress, but with conditions: she will only receive it if she marries one of his great-nephews. The horrid thing is the cousin she wants to marry (Jack) doesn't even come to claim her hand, leaving her to pick from the rest of her weird cousins or be left destitute. She plans to runaway and runs into Freddy Standen another cousin who arrives unaware of his uncle's intentions. Being a favorite of hers, she begs him to fake propose and take her to finally see London under the guise of being introduced to his parents. They plan that after a month they'll quietly break it off and at least she would have seen London. Her real plan of course is to make Jack jealous and force him to finally propose, but what if Freddy is really the one for her?<br /><br />This book was hilarious. Both Freddy and Kitty willingly put themselves in this farce, and although he knows Kitty has another plan he doesn't know it involves the rakish Jack. Kitty sounds pretty conniving, yet I wouldn't call her that in a negative way...like she's crafty in a sweet way? If that makes any sense, and I love Freddy. He is the weirdest hero for sure. He's described as being a dandy, very much interested in clothes and the latest fashion. Look at this description of him:<br /><br />\\"When he relinquished his coat, his hat, his cane, and his gloves into the landlord's hands, a slight look of anxiety was in his face, but as soon as a penetrating glance at the mirror had satisfied him that the high points of his shirt-collar were uncrumpled, and the intricacies of a virgin cravat no more disarranged than a touch would set to rights, the anxious look disappeared, and he was able to turn his attention to other matters.\\"<br /><br />I guess he was the Ryan Seacrest of his day or something, and he doesn't readily seem like a hero at all. I think that's what's so cool about this book, because of his growing love for Kitty he becomes a hero doing things he would not normally do. He becomes someone she can rely on, and he goes out of his way to make sure her wishes are granted. I love the trust between the two, and how he does everything in his power to help the people she loves.<br /><br />I know some people have issues about the extreme details on all aspects of regency life in Heyer novels, but it wasn't that bad. The language confused me sometimes, but I liked reading all the regency slang (dashed well making a cake of me!), and the view of fashionable London through Kitty's eyes.<br /><br />Overall<br />I'm not an expert on Georgette Heyer, or if this is good book to start with. I often hear that if you are new to her novels you should start with Frederica, Venetia, or The Grand Sophy, but I really enjoyed Cotillion. It was witty, and fun to see all the couples in this book end up with who they should.for Kitty he becomes a hero doing things he would not normally do.

0061928356|5.0|I was emotionally glued to every page within every short chapter since the story content, character development and descriptive writing was captivating.  Plus, even though the book was fiction I think the story line was sadly current day truth. The author included book review questions per chapter which makes this book outstanding for a book club for both men and women.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who adores family and children. I am so glad I purchased this book from Amazon for one of my vacation reads.  This book is now making the rounds to two other people. It is an easy and absorbing read.
B003N9ASEI|5.0|The picture and sound on the Blu-Ray appear as good as any other Blu-Ray.  Some reviewers of the 2009 \\"Double-Secret Probation Edition\\" DVD release have stated that the music has been changed and that scenes have recently been cut.  Those complaints do not apply to the Blu-Ray.  I saw this movie in the theater and just replaced the 1998 \\"Collector's Edition\\" DVD.  So far as I can tell, the music on the Blu-Ray and the 1998 DVD is original and the only scenes that are missing are from a montage wherein some of the fraternity members pop diet pills in order to stay awake and cram the answers from a stolen test paper the night before an exam.  As I remember, these scenes were cut after the drug-related death of John Belushi per the wishes of his family and have not been part of the movie since the time of the original theatrical release.  (The only remaining reference to the diet pills is a brief reference by Dean Wormer.)  And as to the missing diet pill montage, don't worry . . . it wasn't that great!
B001N1DPDE|4.0|Out of the box, the factory edge was misaligned visibly. This required a long re-honing on my part to get an edge that was sharp and was aligned correctly. Steel of this type should have been easy to sharpen correctly at the factory and while I don't expect a razor edge out of the box, I do expect the edge to not be lopsided from the tip to the handle.    The steel in this knife is high-quality although be VERY aware that it is not stainless in any way. Even high humidity will cause rust blooms on the unprotected steel. I did expect this, so I did not remove a star for it.    Holds an edge well, and batons easily. Capable of some detail if you choke up on the blade, but not a carver.    Hate Grivory handles, although the problem with the handles loosening with use seems to be fixed with this revision.
0765350386|4.0|The world of Brandon Sanderson's \\"Mistborn\\" takes place in The Final Empire, a society that is governed by an all-powerful religious monarchy that worships a central Lord Ruler. Under his dictatorship, the population is segregated into two castes: the priviledged nobles and the enslaved skaa. This is the central conflict in Mistborn, the enslaved skaa and their suffering under The Final Empire. Amid all this rises one of the central characters \\"Kelsier\\", the leader of a band of high class thieves. Upon accepting a job from the skaa resistance, they take action to destroy The Final Empire, from the inside and out.   One of the most impressive feats that a skilled author can accomplish with their literature is completely immerse the reader into their fictional world. The idea of a world dominated by a red sun and a sky that rains ash makes the reader feel like they're in a world that's totally alien and unfamiliar, yet at the same time makes them feel wonder and awe. This is key to creating immersion and it only makes one wonder how the world came to its current state. But what separates the world of Mistborn the most is the well designed and realized magic system called \\"Allomancy.\\" It revolves around the user digesting small flakes of metal and burning them internally, making themselves into some kind of human furnace. The payoff is that each of the ten known allomantic metals give the wielder a unique temporary power, such as pulling and pushing metal via telekinesis, sensing and disguising allomancy, and tampering with one's emotions. This in turn makes for some of the better fight scenes that I've read in a fantasy novel. With characters launching themselves off metal surfaces, using unorthodox objects as projectiles, and enhancing their normal human strength via pewter. I've always loved authors who go the extra mile to elaborate the usage of magic in their stories. Most authors that I've seen just rely on the fact that it's a fantasy setting and that we shouldjust accept it without questions. The end result feels like a traditional high fantasy setting combined with steampunk.   Kelsier's band of rebels are each an interesting character in their own right, but it's the well developed relationship between the two main characters Kelsier and Vin that really display Sanderson's skill in character development. The character Vin sees the most character development over the course of the book, starting off as a very cynical character filled with self-doubt and bitterness towards strangers. This changes when she meets the charismatic Kelsier and builds a sense of loyalty and trust to his band of thieves. It was a real treat watching the timid Vin evolve over the course of the story, until she becomes more of a hero then she realized she could ever become. I particularly loved the ball scenes the most, where Vin has to meld into a society with customs that are completely new and unfamiliar to her, it's kind of like being the new kid in school only the stakes are incredibly high. Kelsier to me was a very Spartacus esque character, meaning he was the one character with the courage (or madness) to stand up to a vastly superior force, akin to the Roman Empire. People perceive him as a madman due to him surviving the pits and his rebelliousness towards the Final Empire. In truth he's actually a brilliant mastermind full of ambition. Watching his plans unfold towards the end of the book is both gratifying and shocking.  That being said, there are some pacing issues that hinder Mistborn. This book took me much longer to finish than I had anticipated and part of that was due to the plot falling into a rather dull formulaic design around the middle of the story. In a smaller novel this isn't a particularly big deal but in a novel of this proportion it can have an effect on keeping the reader's interest. It was a hindrance but not enough to make me want to stop reading entirely.  Mistborn is a solid fantasy story that anyone can enjoy. The heartful character development, fascinating world building, and intricate magic system put Brandon Sanderson up there with some of the better authors of fantasy.
B0053F042G|4.0|It really was.  Not necessarily the story line but the acting and directing were all very well done.  Great editing.
B004LWZW24|1.0|The first third is Paranormal Activity Part 3, the middle third is Poltergeist Part 4, and the final third is pretty much the same as any other horror movie of the last twenty years.  What a waste of time!  What is the point of watching a movie and caring about the characters even slightly when the endings are all the same:  evil wins.  I usually don't watch new horror films anymore, but I heard this was good and I'm a sucker for this kind of movie but I really think I'm done.  Even paying $.50 at the library was too much for this banana.  The plot is so by the numbers it's ridiculous, and as is typical nowadays you can't see half of anything because it's so dark.  If you have to watch this turkey, get it from your library.  The true horror would be if you BOUGHT this mess.
B004FLAYXI|5.0|I don't make many reviews, but this BR set it's really good. The only \\"problem\\" I had with it is that \\"the briefcase\\" didn't have a handle, but that really doesn't diminish this product at all.  If you liked the movie get it!
1451629184|5.0|After I saw the Diane Sawyer special on TV, I had to immediately go to my computer to order the book.  Kudo's to Amazon because they gave me an even lower price than anticipated.  I ordered the book before it's debut.  I could not put this book down.  Jaycee Dugard's story was heartbreaking and to be able to survive what she did is even more of a testament to her.  I would recommend that everyone read this book.  There is absolutely no way you will not come away from reading this book as the same person that began reading the book.

1932100660|5.0|We have a health crisis in this country--one that affects not only our personal health, but the wealth of our nation.  For those people who want to criticize this book, I would challenge you to read it, experiment on your own body and report back on the results.  Visit your doctor, do preliminary blood work, try the diet for a month, then revisit the doc and the blood work.  If it doesn't work for you, so be it, but don't use your influence to dissuade others for whom this book may be a lifesaver.
B0002S947K|3.0|I first heard Ray's \\"Let It Be Me\\" on a TV program and then decided also to order Trouble.  I liked his voice but band just added \\"noise\\" to background - almost as if it was 2 recording sessions.  Guess I'm showing my age when I like less \\"noise\\" and enjoy listening to more relaxing music. Also thought Ray sounded like Rod Stewart (in his younger days) on \\"Hold You In My Arms\\" and on a few other sounds.

Very good detail of the events leading up to and beyond his making it as a star. I recommend it for anyone. Not your typical rock star adventure.

0345529057|4.0|Beware- Although I bought new, book one in this 4 book boxed set went from page 664 to page 729!(Missing 65 pages... No wonder why I was confused while reading!) I continued reading to page 792 and then it went to page 729 again! So Frustrating! Lucky for me I watched the season one series on HBO so I pretty much know what happened in those pages. Unluckily IT WAS THE CLIMAX OF THE BOOK that was missing! If you know what I should do to get a replacement of book one for my boxed set (hopefully free from Amazon) please let me know.So although I want to give it one star rating because I am mad about the missing pages I can't because I love the book.   I am hooked on this series.So far only read book one and hope that my interest is sustained. I don't usually read \\"fantasy\\" but love the character development and setting in Game Of Thrones. Yes, the book is always better than the movie- or in this case the TV series. You will understand more of the motivations of the characters and also enjoy the detail.

B004YEJGEO|4.0|Definitely worth the .99 price tag.     The first few levels start out fairly easy. Then, at level 1-4, you get stuck pretty good. Took me about 30-45 min just to get past that level alone. I'm now stuck on level 2-11. The logic of the prisms is the biggest feat to tackle. Sometimes they do what you want, sometimes not, depending on how you sequence them.  The controls can be frustrating at times, especially when you want to change laser direction coming out of a prism and it won't let you switch to the other laser for some reason.  One thing I did that helped this tremendously was to go into: options/laser selection/ then change to: Tap Rotation Overlay to Select.    I give this game 4.5/5 stars, based on the fact that it still needs some minor annoyances worked out.
B0000667RO|5.0|Excellent album! I listen to it all the time it is definitely one of my favorites. Music & Lyrics are very well put together and every song has plenty of emotion.
B003NWS5AO|4.0|. . . although I wouldn't say it's anywhere close to being his best solo release.<br /><br />(Robert Plant - Band of Joy - 2010)<br /><br />It's taken me a while, but I believe I've listened to this album enough times and over the course of enough months to finally be able to give it a fair assessment. Please note: this review was written by a fan of Plant's ROCK music. This album leans heavily towards folk music which isn't really my cup of tea, but when it comes to Robert Plant, I love nearly everything he does and I certainly want to hear it. I think his recent folksy excursions with Alison Krauss on RAISING SAND are wonderful. That album certainly deserves all the accolades it's received. BAND OF JOY has some songs that are easily on par with anything from RAISING SAND. There's also some songs here that don't even come close....regardless, I feel compelled to warn you that I personally am more likely to reach for an album like NOW & ZEN, MANIC NIRVANA or especially MIGHTY REARRANGER, in my opinion his very best, than BAND OF JOY, so please take that into consideration while reading this review which consists of one of my typical song-by-song breakdowns...in addition I've done a little bit of research so I've included the original songwriters and (hopefully) the artists who first recorded the songs.<br /><br />\\"Angel Dance\\" (Los Lobos) - what a fantastic way to kick off an album!...While Robert Plant's voice sounds as good as it ever has in the past, this band deserves major prop as well for their first-rate musicianship (as can be expected from any Robert Plant release). I'm not knowledgeable enough to always be able to identify which instrument plays what, so it's interesting to note some of the ones heard on this album include the banjo, pedal steel, lap steel guitar, \\"mandoguitar\\" and mandolin as well as acoustic and electric guitar. \\"Angel Dance\\" features a fantastic droning bass sound and a wonderfully melodic vocal melody. Love the way the banjo dances around during the chorus like the angel of the song title. I think this one's better than the original. Plant greatly enhances the vocal melody and the whole song is more atmospheric. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"House of Cards\\" (Richard Thompson with Linda Thompson) - Richard Thompson is a great songwriter and this meandering, heartfelt tune is a fine example of his talents. It's a slow, ominous dirge. Patty Griffin and Bekka Bramlett add their beautiful voices to the backing choruses. ****<br /><br />\\"Central Two-0-Nine\\" - Originally called \\"Hello Central (Give Me 209)\\", this song gained recognition as a recording by Lightnin' Hopkins although it was first recorded by Robert Lee Westmoreland according to most sources. The arrangement has been altered enough for Robert Plant and Buddy Miller to take writing credits. Miller co-produced BAND OF JOY with Plant and plays several instruments on the album. \\"Central Two-0-Nine\\" is a bluesy tune with an old-fashioned country flavor featuring plenty of acoustic guitar and banjo. It's a bit too quaint and repetitive for my tastes. ***1/4<br /><br />\\"Silver Rider\\" (Low) - The two Low cover songs are most likely the best on the album. The originals are fantastic and Robert does them justice here. Regarding \\"Silver Rider,\\" Plant has been quoted as saying, \\"I had to make it much more \\"creepy-crawl\\" than (the sound on the original track). It could be This Mortal Coil's kid sister...\\" *****<br /><br />\\"You Can't Buy My Love\\" (Barbara Lynn) - Originally cut in 1965, this tune was intended to be a response to the Beatles' \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\". As one is likely to assume, it pales in comparison. The BAND OF JOY version does have a serviceable rockabilly beat and the musicianship is of course top notch. As for my own personal opinion, well, I always skip it if I'm close to the CD player. **1/2<br /><br />\\"Falling In Love Again\\" (The Kelly Brothers) - Though written in 1966, this is an old-fashioned 12-bar blues, a ballad with a chord progression as old as the hills and a style I got sick of almost as long ago. ***<br /><br />\\"The Only Sound That Matters\\" (Milton Mapes) - Milton Mapes was an obscure group from Austin Texas. This is a lovely song with gorgeous lyrics and melodies. *****<br /><br />\\"Monkey\\" (Low) - Gothic, murky and haunted, this one's a killer. *****+<br /><br />\\"Cindy (I'll Marry You Someday)\\" - Another song credited to Plant/Miller, it's a very old traditional tune. Appalachian banjo minstrel Bascom Lamar Lunsford gets prop for influencing the interpretation on this version and there is indeed a banjo prominently featured on it. It's a moderately paced song that sounds like it's got a sort of old-school bluegrass style. Quite good! ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Harm's Swift Way\\" (Townes Van Zandt) - Townes Van Zandt was a brilliant songwriter and a tragic figure - an alcoholic and general screw-up, truth be told). This is the very last song he ever wrote and it's a beauty. It's probably the most country-sounding track on the album - not my kind of music but I make exceptions when it's this good. The lyrics are great and the song sad and poignant. ****1/4<br /><br />\\"Satan Your Kingdom Must Come Down\\" - This is another very old traditional, first recorded in 1931 by an evangelist from South Carolina known as Blind Joe Taggert. It's another 12-bar blues, but it's so good and so well done I'll rate it -- ***3/4<br /><br /> \\"Even This Shall Pass Away\\" - A traditional arranged by Plant/Miller, this one has quite an interesting back story. The words come from an 1867 poem called \\"The King's Ring\\" which was written by poet, abolitionist and American newspaper editor Theodore Tilton. It concerns a Persian King who ruminates about fame, fortune and the hard truth that he will lose it all when he dies. The words were originally used by none other than Chuck Berry for his song \\"Pass Away\\" which closes out his 1979 album ROCK IT. Plant's version is swampy and spooky, a true delight! ****3/4e Only Sound That Matters\\" (Milton Mapes) - Milton Mapes was an obscure group from Austin Texas. This is a lovely song with gorgeous lyrics and melodies. *****  \\"Monkey\\" (Low) - Gothic, murky and haunted, this one's a killer. *****+  \\"Cindy (I'll Marry You Someday)\\" - Another song credited to Plant/Miller, it's a very old traditional tune.

It's a moderately paced song that sounds like it's got a sort of old-school bluegrass style.

B002ZG976U|5.0|I just watched this last night, bought the DVD & will be keeping it to rewatch again & again; in fact I'm hoping there is a soundtrack album to buy here next. Luckily I pay little attention to critics & as others have already said, the critics were crazy or blind, deaf & dumb. I'm not at all a fan of musicals, can't think of a single one I'd want to watch once through, never mind repeatedly. The only other musical I might watch again would be a Chorus Line, maybe.<br /><br />However, this is a movie as much as a musical, if not more so. The story drove the musical numbers, not the other way around as is often the case. The viewer becomes involved in the character's struggles, stories, failures & successes. The actors are amazing in this, not a one slacked off anywhere in this film. The lip syncing was a bit obvious in many of the scenes, not a one live singing, but Christina & Cher, both being pros, did it so well you really had to work to catch the lip syncing. I was surprised at the acting talent Christina proved in this movie, none of it obvious or fake. Cher is as fabulous as ever, sounding & looking good, if a wee bit rough around the edges, but one had to really look to see such. My one pet peeve is with the wigs used throughout the film, all were obvious fakes, being a Barber-stylist I notice such things more than the average person. When you can see light through sections of hair, it's usually a wig, since natural hair fills in those spaces, and Cher's were the worst, left me wondering what her real hair looks like these days. Christina's were more natural looking so that it was difficult to figure out which was the wig vs. real hair, only obvious in a few scenes, but her character uses wigs in the performance, so that's to be expected; Cher's character does NOT have that excuse.<br /><br />The special features left much to be desired, a making-of should have been included, costume & other information could easily have been added but weren't. The bloopers were hilarious is short, the 6 full song numbers left out several better ones in the film that I wanted to see more, especially the last song & dance \\"Show Me How You Burlesque\\" which was some of the best music in this film. The different music styles used will appeal to all audiences of any age, the dancing & costumes were sexy yet tastefully done, and whoever choreographed this movie should have their name up in lights because the dancing in this film was the most original I've ever seen, including such other movies as Step Up. Absolutely nothing boring in this movie, and you won't want to leave your seat for fear of missing something fabulous.short, the 6 full song numbers left out several better ones in the film that I wanted to see more, especially the last song & dance \\"Show Me How You Burlesque\\" which was some of the best music in this film.

1593272839|5.0|I've read every Haskell book ever written (well, maybe not *every* one, but my shelf has at least a cubit's worth) and I've got to say that Miran Lipova'a's \\"Learn You a Haskell for Great Good\\" is the best for the Haskell neophyte.<br /><br />To someone coming from a more \\"traditional\\" programming language, Haskell at first lance appears utterly impenetrable.  However, Mr. Lipova'a does a fantastic job of explaining the fundamental concepts in an interesting and informative way.  For example, Haskell's function signatures are an interesting beast.  That is, from an outsider's perspective the signature pair :: a -> b -> (a, b) can be a little intimidating.  However, this book does a fantastic job of illustrating how these signatures are formed in a consistent manner.  The matter of signatures is just a small bump in the road toward learning Haskell, but it's emblematic of Mr. Lipova'a's attention to detail.  You'll appreciate this attention to detail when the book delves into some of the more arcane topics such as type classes and monads.  That is, Learn you a Haskell *will not* explain these topics in relation to current popular languages, but instead on their own terms.  In my opinion, this is the correct approach and without previous context the author's careful handling of  detail is critical.<br /><br />This is a fantastic book and I highly recommend it as a *the* first book on Haskell -- and possibly even the second.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|I bought this DVD from a club & couldn't wait to see it. The movie itself is very entertaining, suspenseful, great characterizations, involved the viewer in each person's story or perspective, and the actors all did excellent work--making their parts believable, except for one scene that was deleted & only shown in special features, when Ejiofor learns his Dad is still alive (alternate ending), the acting is not credible in that scene only. Harrelson is fantastic as a crazy but knowledgeable conspiracy theorist who wants to go out with a bang, or should I say a burn? Cusack is, as always, amazingly real in all his scenes, as is Glover, Peet & the rest of the cast. If the story, especially the ending, is a bit unbelievable, chalk it up to it being fiction & let it go.<br /><br />However, the one part that really deserves only 1 star if any, is the special effects (and lack of special features--no making of or special effects how-to's, etc). In nearly every scene the CGI is the worst I've ever seen, cartoonish even, and so obviously fake that it pulled me out of the movie nearly every CGI scene. I don't understand why since Emmerich's other movies, such as Independence Day, were awesome in effects. So what happened in this movie? The arks are obviously tiny models in a tub of water, nothing at all real about them & I've seen 12 year old's do better work on youtube. With the technology available today, even 3 years ago, there's no excuse for such poor graphic production design. In all of the action sequences, CGI is not at all credible, nor is the story line in most of these sequences, such as just getting lucky when buildings are falling all around them, or fire bombs hit everything but them, or Cusack is swallowed up in a sink hole miles deep yet somehow emerges without a scratch or a wrinkle.<br /><br />The emotional involvement is definitely great work on the actors & writers parts, the viewer cares about these people & can't look away until the last second of the movie ending--no bathroom or snack breaks, the suspense keeps the viewer glued throughout the movie. The premise is believable, the research & facts are well done, the cinematography spectacular, if only the effects, graphics & CGI had been in any way tolerable this would have been a blockbuster of a movie. I'd recommend renting instead of buying.o bathroom or snack breaks, the suspense keeps the viewer glued throughout the movie.

B00005AREQ|5.0|There seems to be a major resurgence of interest in 1970s music as today's 15-25 year olds rediscover music from that decade. I grew up in the 70s and my friends' teenaged sons and their friends are now frequently asking me about 70s bands and looking for lesser known bands and albums from that era.<br /><br />Jeff Beck is hardly a \\"lesser known\\" artist but, in my defence, I've discovered that many of the young guys asking me about 70s music have, surprisingly, never heard of Jeff Beck. So to help rectify that situation.......<br /><br />This is my favorite Jeff Beck album. It was the first all instrumental guitar album released in the 1970s by a major guitarist and, as such, it was considered a revolutionary album when it was first released. It's easy today to forget just how revolutionary and influential this album was when it first came out, but an all instrumental guitar album by someone of Beck's stature was thought of as being a new direction back then.<br /><br />For those who aren't familiar with Jeff Beck, he was/is one of the world's leading rock guitar players. He first came to prominence in the 1960s as the lead guitar player for The Yardbirds, a spot also held at different times by Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page, so Jeff Beck is firmly in the same league as Clapton and Page.<br /><br />Any guitar player, or aspiring guitar player, should have this album.<br /><br />If you're exploring 1970s music, check out this album. It's less that $10 and it's well worth the money. If you're not familiar with Jeff Beck and you want to check out some other Beck material before you buy it, there's plenty of Jeff Beck material on You Tube.<br /><br />If you want to check out Jeff Beck's 1970s work, my suggestion is to start with this one. If you like this one, buy Wired, which was the followup to Blow By Blow.<br /><br />To sum up, this is great album. If you're discovering/re-discovering 1970s music, this one should be in your music collection.

So to help rectify that situation.......<br /><br />This is one of my favorite Jeff Beck albums. It's actually from 1969 rather than the 1970s but close enough.<br /><br />Some well known musicians appeared with Beck on this album; Rod Stewart did vocals, Ron Wood (later of The Faces, now with The Rolling Stones) played bass,, and Mick Waller (who also appeared on those classic early 1970s Rod Stewart Mercury recordings, like Maggie May and Every Picture Tells A Story) was on drums.<br /><br />Before this album came out, Jeff Beck had come to prominence as the lead guitarist for The Yardbirds, a spot occupied earlier, at different times, by Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page. Clapton, Page and Beck were all blues based players and one of the most interesting things about this album is that it highlights the different directions Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck were taking British blues after their respective stints in The Yardbirds.<br /><br />This album came out in the same year as Led Zeppelin's first album and both albums featured Willie Dixon's \\"You Shook Me.\\" It's interesting to hear the differences in the approaches Beck and Page took to that song, and others. Jimmy Page and Led Zeppelin went their way, Jeff Beck went his.<br /><br />Any guitar player, or aspiring guitar player, should have this album.<br /><br />If you're exploring 1970s music, check out this album. It's less that $10 and it's well worth the money. If you like this, I'd also suggest checking out Jeff Beck's guitar instrumental albums \\"Blow By Blow\\" and \\"Wired\\", released in the mid 1970s. Both are great albums which will be of particular interest to guitar fans and guitar players.

B0012GMWCU|5.0|A lot of younger guys are rediscovering 1970s music. One local CD store owner told me that his store sells more CDs of bands like Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd than it sells of individual contemporary bands.<br /><br />With the resurgence of interest in bands like Led Zeppelin, perhaps people might be interested in Led Zeppelin's influences. One of those influences was Willie Dixon. If you look at the songwriting credits on Led Zeppelin's first album, released in 1969, you'll notice that several songs are credited to W. Dixon. This is the W. Dixon the credits are referring to.<br /><br />Willie Dixon later sued Led Zeppelin, successfully, for taking another of his riffs without giving him credit or royalties.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin's interest in Willie Dixon was no accident. He's one of the giants of American blues. Jeff Beck's Truth, also released in 1969, also has covers of several Willie Dixon songs.<br /><br />This album is a really good introduction to Dixon's music. It was recorded later in his career, when recording technology had advanced dramatically from the days Dixon first started recording. So the sound is a lot better than many of Dixon's earlier recordings.<br /><br />If you're interested in the roots of rock and blues, Willie Dixon is a bluesman you should know about.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I read for fun all the time. One of my best friends told me about Thirteen Reasons Why and what it is about. I do not normally read books about life and suicide. However, I decided I would try it. From the moment I picked the book up, I could not put it down. It is filled with passion, love, and drama that teenagers face everyday trying to fit in. Hannah just wanted to be like everyone else. She wanted to fit in and have real friends. But she thought things got to the point where she could no longer handle it. Hannah killed herself, but before she did she left the cassettes with her reasons why she killed herself. Clay received the tapes and he was very nervous to find out wha he did. When he started to listen to what others had done I became nervous for him. It seemed like everyone before him had done something wrong to add to Hannah's depression. Instead he did nothing. I absolutely loved the way Jay Asher wrote the book. It is one of my favorites. The book is perfect for anyone who has ever felt like they could never fit in or has been made fun of for no reason. It touches a persons heart in ways other books cannot. My only wish was that Clay could have found someway before Hannah had died to tell her how he felt. To tell her how she meant something to him. Those few words could have changed Hannahs mind. I really hope that everyone who reads this book can no longer be afraid to tell someone what they mean to them. It could very well changed their mind.
B004Y1USJE|3.0|I was eagerly anticipating the arrival of Yes' new CD; there first in ten years (unfortunately), and have listened to it about a dozen times since it arrived.  My biggest complaint is the shortness of it - only 47 minutes!  That is rather unforgivable in this day and age - it really should be 74 minutes instead.  So I am glad I did not pay much for it.  Nevertheless, it is a decent Yes album even with the new singer.  He does sound some like Jon Anderson but it is easy to tell that it is not Jon singing.  I cannot add any information to why Jon was not asked to sing on this album beyond what has already been stated in other reviews.  I am willing to let the new singer form his own presence in the band and see what he can do with it - his presence just proves how elastic Yes has been for decades in personnel and style, and still they can put together a decent album which I think also proves their talent as prog musicians.  I do like this album better than Magnification but not as much as Ladder but personally my favorite Yes albums are from the '80's and '90's and that for me includes Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman Howe.
0316098329|5.0|My paperback book arrived on time and the price was reasonable. Room: A Novel was an interesting read. I recommend it.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Soul Surfer is a truly remarkable, inspirational film. Bethany Hamilton is an amazing human being. It was so wonderful to experience some of her true testimony through this film. I am so grateful that this film was made. Soul Surfer will be forever one of my favorites & Bethany Hamilton an inspiring figure in my life.
006112429X|5.0|I purchased a used copy of the paperback We Need to Talk About Kevin. It arrived on time and in good condition. It was very reasonably priced. This is an very interesting novel and I highly recommend it.
006029129X|5.0|I regularly purchase this book to give as a new baby gift and was stunned to come here and discover that it is now nearly impossible to get and that the edition I bought 6 of last year for less than $10 is now over $100!  How very sad for all the babies who won't receive one =(    I just love Harold.  I teach 4th grade and even my 4th graders still reach for Harold when they are tired or have a rare moment to choose an easy read, but it's not about how easy it is to read, it's the story.  Harold makes his own world and in it are fears and joys and all the things that make up a little person's experience.  Kids of all ages are enchanted by the mere idea of being to draw one's way into - and more especially out of - any situation; and the illustrations, though simple line drawings, are timeless and soothing in these times of CGI and Pixar. There is something very special about Crockett Johnson's Harold and every kid who picks up one of his books knows it immediately.    I bought one in \\"Like New\\" condition from one of the alternate sellers, but I if I ever see it again at anything resembling a normal price point I will buy a dozen...thank goodness my grandson already has his copy.
1586487981|5.0|\\"So the poor have hope,<br />And injustice shuts her mouth.\\" -- Job 5:16<br /><br />If a pharmaceutical company wants to improve health, it begins by studying what goes wrong in a disease. Having found the patterns of disease, it looks for ways to interrupt those patterns. When a promising molecule is identified, controlled trials begin. If such trials prove the molecule is safe and effective, governments will license production and prescription of the new medicine.<br /><br />Professors Banerjee and Duflo employ a similar methodology for finding ways to interrupt patterns that lead to and sustain poverty. That's the key message of this book: Unless you employ good methods to identify what to do, money and effort spent on eliminating poverty may well be unproductive or even counterproductive.<br /><br />Those who aren't familiar with the research results will learn a lot about how poverty shapes perspectives and problems so that poor people may well choose alternatives that don't optimize wealth and poverty elimination. Once again, \\"economic man\\" and \\"economic woman\\" are proven to be myths created by theoreticians.<br /><br />My takeaway from this book is that a lot more would be accomplished by earmarking 10 percent of money intended for poor people to conduct studies and trials to find what really works, rather than just spending money on what some \\"expert\\" believes will work.<br /><br />In my own work on the 400 Year Project (to accelerate global improvements by 20 times), successful poverty elimination experiments have required a lot of individual adjustments for each person and family. But typical \\"solutions\\" to poverty don't encompass such flexibility.<br /><br />I liked the last part of the book best, \\"In Place of a Sweeping Conclusion,\\" where the professors point out the results of individual studies completed to date don't allow for any sweeping conclusions.<br /><br />Bravo and Brava!
0765322889|3.0|I do much reading, infact I prefer reading so much more over television that I don't even have cable. I am telling everyone this so they understand that I didn't just pick up the book and try to read something that was way out of my level. I did however, for the first time, choose to find an author I have never heard of and read one of their books (Steven Erikson was that choice).<br /><br />It took me a bit to get sucked into his book, but it did happen. He had amazing detail, though sometimes it was the over detail that made me lose interest. Throughout this book I fell in an out of intrest, but what kept me going was the cliff hangers he left after finishing a section of a characters story. All in all I say that it was a good book. My problem with it the most is that just when I would get sucked into the story he would stop and transfer to another character leaving me barely interested. I like a story I can follow consitantly, that will play like a movie in my head all throughout the book, but unfortuently this book didn't do that for me. I had to think about each character, which didn't provide the smooth story I was craving.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I love this app. Thousands of radio stations to choose from, and it works flawlessly over Verizon 3G. if your car stereo has an aux in jack, you just found a free and more interesting alternative to satellite radio. \n\nAlso, no battery drainage issues on my Thunderbolt whatsoever.
0307913090|4.0|A dark/middle ages sort of setting but the issues are as modern as today.  You cannot skip around the books though - there are a lot of characters and everyone has a role.  Plan on leaving plenty of time for reading.  George Martin really knows how to develop a society and setting that hang together and provide a unified and interesting world for his characters.  I found myself, as I worked my way throgh the first four volumes, getting angry at characters for their carelessness and stupidity, appreciating others for their intelligence and nerve - which is what you want in a good read - characters that you get into.  A line from the series was particularly significant \\"Slow mind, quick temper\\"; much of the disasterous decisions and subsequent bad outcomes were a function of quick tempers, and not enough thinking, scheming and conniving.  The dwarf is one of the more interesting characters - but keep reading it gets better.<br /><br />I have really enjoyed the CD - and am about 1/3 way through it.  I had read but pick up a lot that i missed in reading since I was ready too fast I guess.  The series was what got me to resd the books and the books are more engaging.  The series is not for little kids or those bothered by old anglo saxon terminology or significant amount of nudity but it was a different era.
B0038M61I2|1.0|I have the original vinyl. Bought it 1961 or so. Great record, although not as good as NEWK's TIME...The 'Remastering'. ahem,  is dreadful, unless you like to hear the bass obliterating everything, especially the drums. So much of the 'remasstering' today is done  by enginners who never  heard this music live. Understandable, but still,  a bass played on gut strings into a microphone, one microphone is not an 'acoustic' bass with steel strings played thru an amplifier into multiple mics.
B00007H1Y2|5.0|Mambo Sinuendo is a really great CD.     Although a bit more modern than Buena Vista Social Club, Ry Cooder and Manuel Galban show their great musical talent in these recordings.
B000002LIR|5.0|I love this album.  I had it on very old tapes and now I have it on CD.  The only thing I did not check out is to see if there exists a remastered digital version.  This is not but I still love it.  Barbara from Boynton Beach, Fl
044654759X|5.0|I just picked this book up two days ago and have not been able to put it down. I had to finish it today. I absolutely loved it. I have to read a lot of heavy material for work, and it is nice to have an easy read that is extremely well written and the author does an amazing job of writing. I flet like I was watching a movie because it was so clearly written.
B002IFT1ZA|4.0|My boyfriend recently made me sit down and watch this entire series with him. I did NOT think it would be my thing, as I'm not a fantasy buff like he is. However, I was pleasantly surprised! I was hooked after the first episode. I loved the witty dwarf, and hated that awful little prince. There were so many characters (almost too many!), but I felt like each one came to life. It was almost enough to inspire me to read the books... but my boyfriend will have to keep trying on that one!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was very entertaining and hard to put down. The story just keeps getting better and youll want more and more as you keep reading. You wont want the book to end!
B0050I2P32|5.0|The Horror's latest album is a delight, full of 80's synths and modern electronics, drenched in guitars and post punk attitude.  The vocals are reminiscent of some of the best of the 80's--Psychedelic Furs, Simple Minds; Faris Badwan sings with a slightly husky baritone dripping with \\"cooler than thou\\" attitude.  And you know what?  It's not posing if you can back it up.  This is simply a cool album--melodic without being overly poppy, mysterious without being precious, wondrous without being ridiculously overproduced.  I'm not sure how they arrived in this particular direction, with My Bloody Valentine, New Order (a la Love Vigilantes) and Psychedelic Furs mixed up into a New Romantic Post Punk Indie magic record, but I'm glad they did.  I like this record a lot, and will be recommending it unreservedly to fans of any of the above groups, as well as folks who like Interpol, Echo and the Bunnymen, and similar groups.  Check it out.
B004TF3HSO|5.0|I bought this 2CD Deluxe Edition mainly because it includes the English version of Le Orme's 1973 album \\"Felone E Sorona\\". For that version - entitled \\"Felona & Sorona\\" and originally released on Charisma in 1973 - Peter Hammill wrote English lyrics that were for some period unable to find other than on the gatefold cover of that vinyl record.    Both versions of this musical piece are interesting for me. The Italian original is brilliant; the English one could be better than it is if they had polished the pronunciation, however I have never met an Italian performer singing without at least slight accent. Both languages are musical, but somehow \\"musicality\\" of Italian language creates obstacles for fluent singing in English, in my opinion.    On the positive side I would mention the informative and aesthetic aspect: improved audio, laminated triple-fold sleeve with a separate section for the booklet with notes, record label scans, etc. make this package worth buying. I even find it good that different versions are released on separate discs. However, to my great surprise, the source used for the English version was not original master tape but a vinyl copy. I am not sure, but maybe this is because the original master tapes have been lost.... Probably, the digital transfer has been declicked, but vinyl noise still can be heard while playing this CD. Another annoying but short audio problem is found on the Italian version - absolute \\"vacuum silence\\" in one of the channels in the beginning of \\"All'infuori del tempo\\".    Nevertheless, since those who have transferred the vinyl into digit in the past *do have* their files with clicks and pops and jumps and all the attributes of a normal vinyl playback, I think that some light pops and the background noise would not be a big trouble. This is now done for us on some professional (I suppose) equipment and by skilled (I hope) pairs of hands and ears. The strange thing for me is still the fact that same material has been released on vinyl, meaning that plus to the \\"original\\" noise'n'pops there will surely be added noise'n'pops while playing the vinyl record on your turntables. Does it make sense?    To conclude, I would say that, in my opinion, today this is the best version of \\"Felona E/& Sorona\\" on CD to go into your collection, hence (despite all complains) I rate this product with 5 stars.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Good app but needs more themes.   Predictions are pretty impressive after it learns your habits. A little expensive at $4.   Lg g2x.
0525951652|1.0|Question..I purchased a used book, Fall of Giants.  It was in great shape, however it was a book obviously taken from a county library.  Had the plastic cover on it and the identifying label from the library, with the reference information.  On the inside back cover, it was stamped, \\"Withdrawn\\" and inside the book was the receipt from the library stating it was checked out and due for return in April, 2011.  Is this normal practice to sell current library books through Amazon's used book program...or was this book stolen from the library?  Thank you.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I am very happy with this camera bag.  It's nice and strong, good size bag, not to small not to large.  Has a ton of storage pockets n such.  Fits all my extra batteries, memory cards, lenses, speedflash etc...  I really like the overall design and it seems like a solid bags.  Straps were easy to adjust.  Mini tripod holder is a good feature too.  A+ item in my book.  I honestly have nothing bad to say about it.
034544678X|5.0|The information in this book is incredibly insightful and rich.  I especially enjoy that the author starts out each section by given you a real life example from her dogs or clients to help you understand the topic.  She is increibly honest and by the time you are done with the book all you want to do is grab a cup of coffee with the author and love on her dogs.  Amazing book, I would recommend it to anyone who has a dog or is considering getting one, as there is a whole section on selecting the appropriate dog for you.
B0055PMUSU|4.0|My entire family really enjoyed this movie. I think it makes a difference when you know it is based on a true story and that people with true courage and integrity still exist in this world.
0894803123|5.0|Absolutely love this book!!  I refer to it as my \\"Ice Cream Bible\\". I received the Cuisinart ICE-21 Frozen Yogurt-Ice Cream & Sorbet Maker as a birthday gift and I immediately purchased this book for recipes.  After making my first ice cream using a recipe from this book, we found that it was a bit sweet (and heavy) for our taste. So, I tweak my favorite sweet cream base recipe by substituting light cream for the heavy cream that it calls for and warming that with milk [using the same measurements as called for]. Then I add the whisked eggs and sugar (after tempering the eggs by adding a bit of the warmed milk/cream mixture) to help dissolve the sugar.  I then transfer to a bowl and refrigerate it for a few hours before pouring it into my ice cream maker.  Then I add the candies or fruit or whatever else I'm using to make that specific ice cream & it works great!  My family prefers the ice cream a bit harder than the soft serve the machine produces so I usually put the mixture in a sealed container in the freezer for a few hours before serving.  It is amazing!!  This book has been fantastic :)
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|While I will admit that I much prefer the 1995 BBC version, this was an excellent movie and only a two hour commitment versus nearly six hours.  All of the important story elements were included and the characters were well cast.  I especially liked Rosamund Pike and Simon Woods as Jane Bennett and Mr. Bingley.  And Jena Malone was very convincingly annoying as Lydia Bennett.  They did take a few creative liberties but I thought they turned out well.  For example, in this movie, Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Bennett do seem to love each other despite their banter. I was okay with that though, maybe others wouldn't be.  I would recommend at least watching it, if not buying it.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I downloaded it and started it up but It crashes as soon as it loads pls fix for htc evo 4g
B002Q8GZ62|5.0|The Spandau boys are back and still sounding fantastic!  I was pleasantly surprised to find that Tony still sounds the same, if not better.  The tracks are great...although I think Gold, True, and Only When You Leave are better in their original version.  However, that being said, I really loved the new versions of She Loved Like Diamond and To Cut A Long Story Short...much better than the original. And whoa! Hearing Tony hold that note was impressive! The new songs are good too!  My favorite song is the one written by Tony Hadley (Love Is All).  It's a lovely ballad and Mr. Hadley really should write more songs.
B0055JP7EU|5.0|I have watched all the episodes and have to say this is my favorite. If you haven't watched them all you will not get the significance of all his \\"friends\\" coming to his aid, so let me way that I got goose bumps on this one. This was very well written and acted. I have watched this at least 5 times.
B004XE0P5E|4.0|The most fitting way I can find to describe the second album from Bon Iver (a.k.a. Justin Vernon) is that it is easier experienced than explained.  This is an album that is overflowing with different sounds and textures that work together beautifully to create a lush palette of emotional richness.  Vernon's vocals are once again hauntingly beautiful and effortlessly convey the myraid of feelings that he is working through, be it sorrow and heartache or optimism and fulfillment.  That entire spectrum is covered by music that is remarkably layered and nuanced.  Each listen reveals different facets of Vernon's songwriting and his ever shifting emotional state. This is music that truly speaks to the listener.  Chances are that even if you aren't able to decipher all of the lyrics of \\"Bon Iver\\", or even if you don't try, you'll still know exactly what they mean because you will feel it in your bones.  That is the beauty of this remarkable record which will be remembered as one of the year's best.
1597801585|3.0|I bought The Windup Girl because it sounded interesting and had so many favorable reviews here. Unfortunately, I found it nowhere near as good as I had expected. The book is okay leaning towards mediocre, and the buzz only served to make me more disappointed. The plot is predictable throughout most of the book, and even when it wasn't, I had a hard time caring because the characters are so utterly unlikable. By the end, I only cared about three people,one of whom was already dead. The windup girl herself hardly moved me; I felt bad for her, but she had such a flat personality it was hard to care too much.In addition, while the whole idea of generipping was interesting, the disaster that made it necessary was never completely explained.     Basically, this book fails in the way that so many science fiction works do. The characters and plot are merely a vehicle to get the point across, and only very basic work went into them. A story should be built on its characters, not the other way around.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|Hi my name is adriana,I stared watching teen wolf and im hook on it,I cant believe its going to end i wish m t.v. would keep it on all year,please let me know when the first season comes to dvd i want to buy it,its a great show!:)
B00005MNP8|5.0|I originally bought this album on vinyl back in 1979 when I was 13 years old. I played it so many times that it wore out and I had to by another. Since then I have owned it on cassette and finally CD. It is also downloaded into my ipod. The album is a mixture of NY punk, New Wave & Disco. Every song on it is Great, there isn't one that I don't Love! It is one album I will never tire of listening to!
B0012GMXYM|5.0|This is without doubt Carlos best work, ahead of LDS, Welcome, Illuminations and Caravanserai. Borboletta is deep, mystical, sophisticated and complex. It transcends culture and ethnocentric idiosyncrasy, to elevate music to a higher dimension.  The lineup on this album is a who's who of creative music. Jules Broussard on sax, the vocals of Lean Patillo and Flora Purim, the amazing percussion of Shrieve, Peraza, Airto Moreira and Areas, together with the slick organ of Costa and Stanley Clarke on bass. Most `people grow with age and experience, Carlos seems to have gone the other way!! It astonishes me that somebody can create this masterpiece and then come up with the simplistic duets that have been regurgitated over the past 10 years. I guess that he's giving the masses what they want.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Although this collection came out a few years ago, I didn't pick it up until recently when I just happened to find this during an Amazon Lightning Deal.  I was a little leery of the quality of this collection due to it's age and the recycled special features.  After watching all three films and the Animatrix, I can honestly say these are some of the best Blu-Rays I have ever seen.  The picture for the first movie is extremely good, although it is grainy and not as detailed as the other two.  As for the sequels, the picture is perfect.  Reloaded and Revolutions both have one of the clearest HD pictures I have ever seen on Blu-Ray,  representing the highest echelon of HD movies.  The audio is equally amazing, with each channel perfectly balanced and every bit of audio crystal clear.  When it comes to special features, this set is jam packed.  Everything you want to know about the making of the movies is covered, with the exception of any interviews with the Wachowskis themselves, although none of it is presented in HD.  The Animatrix is presented in 1080p HD as well, though lacks the detail the other movies have, perhaps because they're animation, or perhaps because they didn't put as much effort into the digital transfer, I don't know.  Not to say it looks bad, it just lacks the oomph of the other movies.  As for the plot of the movies, I won't bother to review them here as they have been reviewed and analyzed to death elsewhere.  Most people seem to love 'em or hate 'em, and I fall under the love 'em category.  If you've been curious about the quality of this release, I can assure you it is of the highest caliber both visually and audibly.  Watching the Matrix in HD is truly a sight to behold.  If you're a fan of The Matrix and you have a Blu-Ray player, you're in for a treat.  Highly recommended.

B0050PYNOY|2.0|I had this movie on my list of ones to check out this summer along with Super 8, Captain America, and all the other films with blockbuster buzz because many of the same ingredients that made Pineapple Express were there. It had Danny McBride, James Franco, and it was a stoner action film. I thought Pineapple Express was hilarious, but I have to admit that wasn't my initial assessment. At first, I disliked Pineapple Express because it seemed like it couldn't decide how serious it wanted to take itself, but it just got better upon repeat viewings; the action started to seem more appropriate for the story and the dialogue only got funnier the more I thought about how it was delivered.<br /><br />Sadly, acquiring the taste to enjoy Pineapple Express didn't allow me to be satisfied by Your Highness on the first viewing, and I'm glad I didn't see it in theaters or purchase this one. There's more action in this one and it's passable, but it leaves less time for the comedy, or perhaps it simply didn't blend as well. There was more than one action scene in Pineapple Express where Seth Rogan puts his terrible fighting skills to use, so there was a comedic slant to the action, but there's less of that here. Also, essentially all of the best parts were in the red band trailer, which is always sad.<br /><br />Basically, this movie gets one star for the decent action and effects and another star for Natalie Portman's bare backside.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|The item arrived quickly and in pristine condition. I am thoroughly satisfied with this transaction. My only problem rests with the 'movie' itself. It stuck too close to the book. (grin)
0470449748|2.0|I bought this hoping I was going to be prepared for the GMAT and I was disappointed with my score after I took the test the first time. I took the test again and studied the Princeton guide and improved my score more than 100 points. This book is just so dense and cold. It didn't excite me about taking the GMAT (not that any book will). Where it lacked the most was teaching you about the Data Sufficiency problems in the Quantitative Section of the test. That is easily one of the most difficult sections of the test because of how confusing the wording can be and this book did not make it any easier to understand. Princeton's book made sure that the Data Sufficiency section was my most-improved section. My advice is to stay away from this book and start with the Princeton version. If you need more problems to practice, then I might suggest picking this up.
B0050PLT8W|1.0|Like the other 300 bands out there, these guys sound like a Nickleback cover band.  Raspy voice, hard guitar......all lame.
0553801473|5.0|George R.R. Martin is simply a great story teller. I have devoured his pages and find this latest edition to be just as worthy as his previous books. I can't wait until.....Winter!!!! You never know what may happen next!
0439023521|5.0|This book is fantastic.    My whole family read this. It gets you from page one and won't let go. The subsequent books aren't as good, but this one stands on its own and is great. It does leave you at the end knowing the second book is coming, which is kind of lame, but to be expected.
0345529057|5.0|This set of books is terrific.  The great part about this purchase was that buying all four books together was cheaper than only buying the three that I needed.  I am very happy with the purchase.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I was pleased with how quickly I received the blue-ray and the quality of the product was terrific as always.    Thanks,  Laura
B005869U6G|3.0|This release may not be a masterpiece but is definitely worth a listen.  Most obvious complaint is the tone of the album.  It is very consistent and not much stands out from the rest.  There are a few highlights however.   These include Isadore and Switchblade.  Brandon Boyd's individual release is perhaps a bit better than this but overall it was ok.
B004YXE438|5.0|Lots of options and ways to increase and\/or decrease the difficulty. It comes with many images, but you can use your own as well.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Loved the game, wish it was longer. The night and fog levels were kind of annoying but looking back it made for a more deep and rich overall experience.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|A lot of people need to realize who this movie is targeted at: kids.  If you are an adult and reviewing this movie, time to re-think your life choices. ;)      My son absolutely loved this movie.  The whole \\"spy\\" and international intrigue stuff was right up his alley.  As for all the conservative idiots who hate this movie ONLY because it goes after \\"big oil\\", that is truly sad and a pathetic statement about THEM, not this movie.      I did notice that when the first Cars came out, my then-younger son seemed to \\"fit\\" that movie.  Now that he is older, the more-intense, more-complex story line of the second movie matured with him, if that makes sense.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|In one month, I read all five books in the series of ASOIAF! Needless-to-say, I am a new fan. What makes this series so captivating is Martin's ability to juggle numerous story arcs for each Point of View (POV) character. Each arc has a different pace and climaxes at different times to keep the story moving along. The only dissapointment I can find with ADWD is that we have to wait a few years to find out what happens next to these ever-growing characters. I have not been able to pick up any book since ADWD this summer to reach the same high as the immersed story of Westeros. Therefore I am reading them again!<br /><br />For a perspective of my genre preferences; I read mostly science fiction (i.e Asimov, Heinlein, Willis and Simmons) and classical to modern fiction (from Dickens and Austen to Cormac Mcarthy) and rarely fantasy. The only other fantasy books I have enjoyed are from J.R.R. Tolkein and Ursula K. Le Guin.
B004LWZVZC|4.0|\\"Members of the Commission, do not permit this injustice to Mary Surratt by sacrificing our sacred rights out of revenge.\\" After the assassination of President Lincoln the entire country is looking for someone to blame. A trial of the conspirators takes place. Young lawyer Frederick Aiken (McAvoy) is picked to defend the lone woman Mary Surratt (Wright). When he begins to believe that she is innocent can he do enough to convince the military court? Being a huge history buff I was looking forward to this movie and it did not disappoint. Opening with the assassination then moving quickly to the trial this movie had me interested from the beginning. The aspects of trial are as relevant today as they were at the time. Without trying to give anything away the judges go in with a verdict in mind and will stop at nothing to get it. Aiken does everything he can to let Mary go free, but everyone is working against him. This is another movie that exposes the flaws in the justice system. For history buffs you will really enjoy this movie. For the casual watcher this is one of the better courtroom movies to come out in a while. This is a very, very good movie. Overall, an extremely enjoyable movie that will keep you watching even if, like me, you know the ending going in. I highly recommend this movie. I give it an A-.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Yes I would, but again I love this type of history.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|Since the creation of the Blu Ray player, there is one movie I have begged, wished for, and lamented not being available in this format.  And now it is being released!  Yes, The Crow, the one and ONLY original will be released on October 18, 2011.  Blaise is doing the happy dance.  Even the idea that I will soon have in my hands the greatest movie of all time, in the best format ever created, makes me smile.<br /><br />\\"I tell you when I used to think about the idea itself it put a big old smile on my face.\\"<br /><br />Follow up:<br /><br />This is my favorite movie all over again!  It turned out even better than I thought it would, almost like really being on set.  We lost the \\"rain effect\\" so when they keep saying \\"it can't rain all the time\\" it looks a little weird but hey, small price to pay.  And I noticed things I had never seen before.  Like when Skank is driving the stolen car down the dead end alley it says \\"Happy\\" on the dead end wall.  Happy Ending, get it?  And the church!  In the scene when Top Dollar grabs Sarah, you can read \\"Demolished by Neglect\\" on the church. Seriously, if you a re a fan, this is as close to being there as you'll ever get!
B003L20IHE|5.0|I was surfing channels and caught the beginning of Charlie St. Cloud on HBO.  stopped to watch a few minutes and didn't move for the entire movie. Never followed Zac's career before (I'm a little older than he is ;D ) but I found myself absolutely n love with him, the character of his little brother and the entire cast (huge fan of James Franco so u can imagine how shocked I was when I fell for the character Lt. Sully, actor brother of James, Lord have mercy...haha).  I found the movie addicting. I can't pass the channel if the movie is on now! no matter if the the movie is starting, in the middle or near the ending...gotta watch. AND YES, I have ordered the movie and it's on the way. I would recommend this movie before all others to all my fellow movie lovers. The story line is mesmerizing. I loss my sister several years ago and although we are much older than the characters in this movie, I still find myself wishing that the ending to her life and life as I knew it with her in it could have had an ending like Charlie and Sam's (meet at sunset cannons, come hell or high water,I promise!!)...if only for a while. RECOMMEND THE MOVIE 100%!!!! LOVED IT...LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT IT...I ACTUALLY THINK IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OSCAR WORTHLY BACK DURING IT'S TIME OF RELEASE. LOVE IT!!!!!
1433524708|2.0|it appears to be a great Bible. however, the 1st thing i noticed was the small font; and; even smaller font of the teaching sections - cant hardly read it, at the bottom of the page. the font there is very very small.   then there is no standard of font sizing.  for example pages 226 and 227 have different font sizes and spacing between lines. this makes it very annoying to read.  i realize they used small font size to cut on cost. but, if i want read a book i want it all to be one font size and spacing. along with bigger font for the teaching sections.
0312382464|5.0|A great mix of history and imagination with the reality of what occurs in the story making it a fascinating read.  It also offers a great balance in delivering the story from the perspective of both feminine & masculine characters that combine to allow the reader a unique perspective of what transpires.

B000JLSM00|5.0|The Bluray edition is required to appreciate John Ford's eye for composition and cosummate skill in achieving the look he wanted.  The color is a bit bright, but probably duplicates the original film version as seen in theaters of the time, being from an early era of color film when saturation was enhanced and the reds seem to come through better than the blues.  This is one of very few excellent movies made in Vista Vision, a format that is ideal for some of the interior scenes, and allows the use of wide angle lenses with a larger depth of focus, while still getting excellent resolution on the actor's faces.  The performance of John Wayne is wonderful, of course, and so is Vera Miles.  Get this edition and watch it carefully, you are in for a treat, \\"analog\\" movie making at its finest.
1936719118|4.0|I love to read about other entrepreneurs' journey, primarily to find inspiration when going gets tough. If you are like me, this is a book you should read. The author, Derek Sivers, a singer & song writer turned entrepreneur & software programmer, tells his story of accidentally stumbling on a business, CDBaby, that he wanted to keep as a lifestyle business, but ended up selling it in the end. He deconstructs his journey over 10 years into 40 lessons learned, which all entrepreneurs experience in some form or fashion. Explains them in the context of what actually happened without being pedantic. A few that I found important are:    1) \\"Being, not having.\\" Here Derek talks about how everything he did was not for the end result only, rather was for the journey involved. It was not about just having a site, but being a programmer who wrote the codes behind the site. It was not about putting out a CD with songs, but being a producer who did everything that is required to create the CD. It was not about having a successful business, but being an entrepreneur that involved doing all the little things in building & running the business.    2) \\"Delegate, but not abdicate.\\" Here he talks about how he thought making him unnecessary in running his business through delegation would be a good thing. Turns out, it ultimately led him to sell his business that he wanted to keep as a lifestyle business.    3) \\"Trust, but verify.\\" Here he talks about how he trusted an employee to take care of the most critical aspect of his business operation, and did not keep an eye on. This caused a major issue with his customers, and ultimately led to firing that person.    Last but not least, I found it interesting how he setup a trust with the proceeds from the sale of his company to benefit independent artists. This, in my humble opinion, should be emulated by others who are lucky to be in that position to do so.    If you want to get a taste of what to expect from this book, here is a talk from the man himself at the business of software conference- [...]
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought the DVD set of Firefly 2 years ago because it was an Amazon Goldbox Offer.  A friend of mine had recommended the series but I thought, \\"surely this show can't be great...\\".  I mean, I saw previews of Serenity when it came out in theaters and it didn't look all that interesting.  When I stumbled on the Amazon Deal, I checked the reviews and was shocked to see so many 5 star ratings compared to so very little negatives.  And although still skeptical, I figured that $17 for the entire series worth of episodes was worth a shot.    The DVD set sat on my video collection shelf for another 6 months and finally I had absolutely nothing to do so I popped in the first episode.  The production value seemed a bit low and it started out in some kind of flashback which reminded me a little of Starship Troopers and I initially thought that I had made a mistake in purchasing the set.      Then something amazing happened.  I don't know at what point in the pilot episode my opinion turned but by the time I finished watching it, I was hooked.  I watched an episode a night and had to pause when I came to the last episode because by that time, I knew that this amazing series was concluding (or at least there would be no more episodes or stories, save the feature, Serenity).    Since then, I've been like Mel Gibson's character in Conspiracy Theory and whenever Firefly comes out in an Amazon Goldbox, I feel compelled to buy it.  I have two DVD sets and the BluRay edition.  I've loaned out my DVD sets and guarantee to those borrowing it that they will love it.  I've never had a dissatisfied \\"customer\\" yet!      Here's to the hope that there will be a Firefly series revival one day!
1423101502|3.0|I looked forward to this book eagerly, but felt let down in many ways. The story seemed to be nonstop action from beginning to end, with little time for thought or analysis, and the battle scenes were neither terrifying nor riveting nor interesting: just something to wade through. Some of the wrapping-up was interesting and applicable to today's world, but this book did not leave me wanting to read more Olympians adventures. In fact, I felt as if the author were hurrying through this in order to get on to something else.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I first saw an excerpt of this book on Stephenie Meyer's website I figured if she liked it, and I like her books, then I should like it too. Well, after the first handfull of pages I wasn't into the story so I wrote it off. A couple of months back I heard that they were making the Hunger Games into a movie. I was at the local bookstore, picked up the book and read the inside cover. I thought to myself that this book sounded very interesting and why in the heck didn't I finish reading the excerpt on the website. Anyway, I did something that I never, ever do anymore....I bought all 3 without reading a single one. I have bought the first and second book in a series and I usually have to force myself to get though the first book and never pick up the second. I read them back to back and enjoyed each one to the point where I want to read them again. My son, who is 17, commented that some of his friends where talking about the book and if he could borrow the Hunger Games. I told him that it starts slow, but you will know when the story begins to pick up. He loved the book! Now, he is not a reader like me and won't read them back to back. I'm waiting for school to start again and maybe, just maybe he will have the second book read by the time the first movie comes out. I don't like to critique books because everyone has a reading style, or an author they prefer. And I never use reviews as a basis to buy or not to buy a book. I like to tell people the story of how I came across the book because there is always someone out there with a story similar to yours. This book, for you, might have been 'my daughter left it lying on the kitchen counter and I grabbed it on my way to the doctor's office because, as you know, the magazines stink'. Everyone has their own story...what is yours?
B004HO6I4M|5.0|when I got this movie out of the video store to rent it to see for the 1st time I was amazed. I thought the story was great about Blu learning how to fly and meeting the other birds of Rio De Janerio. I always thought Rio De Janerio was in Africa. I was wrong. This movie shows a lot of explenation about each character. Once again, 20th Century Fox releases a new deep animated and well organized film. They had also said that the film was going to look somewhat like the birds in  the angry birds app and they did. Watch the movie and play the iphone, android app and you just might see some relations.
B004NSULHM|2.0|I've been a Radiohead fan since the \\"Amnesiac\\" era, ever since I was given a disc with a medley of songs from OK Computer, Kid A, and the \\"new one\\", Amnesiac. I wore that CD-R out and I went out and bought OK Computer - I instantly fell in love. I soon bought every Radiohead CD available.<br /><br />They have been experimenting and expanding their catalog of sounds and structures ever since then, and I have respected them for that.<br /><br />When In Rainbows came out, I was floored. I loved it. I read the reviews for King Of Limbs on here and I thought, \\"Could it really be that bad?\\"<br /><br />I bought the disc regardless and have listened to it a few times, enough to get used to it. Here are my thoughts.<br /><br />You are NOT going to like it if :<br /><br />1) You are expecting hooks to draw you in; like a bursting chorus line, melodic verses, or addictive guitar lines.<br /><br />2) You are in love with Radiohead's last release \\"In Rainbows\\", and are expecting this album to provide similar results.<br /><br />3) You do not like electronica.<br /><br />You ARE going to like it if :<br /><br />1) You like electronica.<br /><br />2) You are a huge fan of Thom Yorke's \\"Eraser\\"<br /><br />3) You are a sold-out Radiohead fan that will like what they put out no matter what.<br /><br />I belong in the former camp. I was not impressed and I was actually, if I dare say it, bored with the record. Call me narrowminded, call me tasteless, call me un-artful. I didn't like it. There was nothing catchy enough to keep my attention, and nothing for my ears or emotions to hold on to. I don't mind the beats and the blurps - but please, they have to be catchy.<br /><br />To me, this record sounded like static, a ghostly megaphone, and a snare loop stuck on repeat.<br /><br />Every song sounds like a variant of \\"The Gloaming\\" from Hail To The Theif (with the exception of \\"Codex\\" and \\"Give Up The Ghost\\"). It was my least favorite song from the band, and since this record sounds like several of them, it is my least favorite record.
0553801473|1.0|I preordered the book on my kindle and hoped for the best, but was sorry I bought it. Even middle books in a series require introduction, development and conclusion, but ADWD left you with no resolution at all! People complain about \\"cliffhangers\\", but they are not even cliffhangers; plotlines just end and leave you nowhere. And what's with the title?  A Dance with Dragons? The dragons did absolutely nothing until the very end, and I certainly wouldn't call that a dance. The Meereen chapters were the worst: long exposition about people and politics I didn't give a fig about, endless inconsequential new characters, and Dany devolves from a strong queen to a dumb, lovesick teenager. Tyrion has lost his cutting wit and goes on a long, meandering river cruise getting nowhere. Everyone in the East was heading toward Dany, but no-one (except Quenton!) arrived. The best chapters were the ones in the North. If Martin had continued those plotlines until after the battle, we would have gotten a conclusion and been eager for the next stage. Too bad he has a fangirl editor; a good edit was what AFFC and ADWD really needed.
0061120073|3.0|This is the first time I have purchased a book that has stated \\"good\\" condition.   I usually get excellent or like new.  It's rather old and the pages fall out as I use it but it works for me as long as all the pages are there and I can get through a classic I've always wanted to read.  It arrived quickly.
0756404738|4.0|I liked the book, but didn't *love* it, like I did with The Name of the Wind. I guess my expectations just mounted too high after the excruciatingly long wait between book one and two. I felt like for a book that is ~1000 pages long, not a whole lot actually happened. The book sort of dragged along, and most major scenes were longer than they needed to be. He could have done it in 800 pages, easily.    That being said, I was hooked the whole time, and sad when it ended. Can't wait for #3!
B0026P3G12|5.0|I was simply amazed at the quality, clarity and feeling portrayed by her voice.  Since she came out with that CD, I've listened to it probably a 100 times.  It's absolutely the best of the best.  What talent she has.  I'm so glad that she rose to the top so fast.  Susan deserved every minute of the limelight.  I patiently wait to hear her future CDs.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|I have only had the Sony Dualshock controllers for the last few years. This was a pleasant surprise as a controller. It is that much different from a Dualshock controller? Well it is shaped differently, a bit wider and more curved. And it defintiely has a better grip. There is a bit more space between the thumb controller and the XO buttons. The L1,L2,R1,R2 buttons are easier for me to get to. I like it better, but not by a big margin and I suppose it would come down to personal preference and hand size. I think average to bigger hands would like this better.<br /><br />Because it is not a Sony though, it is just a little bit harder to use. You have to have the supplied synch stick in one of the PS3 USB slots or the controller stops working. And you can't push the PS3 button on the controller and get the system to turn on. You can turn off the system or the controller with the PS3 button though.
B0006HXXBA|5.0|German Thrash Metal band Kreator have really been on a high since releasing their Violent Revolution album in 2001. The band forged a new direction by combining a return to roots Thrash Metal sound with hints of Gothenburg, Melodeath and even Metalcore incorporated into the overall style.<br /><br />2005's Enemy Of God was the second album in this new style, the band were refreshed and recharged musically and put out a brilliant quality album with hundred's of riffs, mixing high speeds, grooves and occasional dark melodic moments with dual guitar harmonies. The overall production quality is fantastic; the sound is heavy, clear and crisp.<br /><br />The band themselves are on top form, with longtime members Mille and Jurgen put down great performances on their respective instruments as well as vocally.  Kreator have had a few line up changes in their career but Enemy Of God sees a stable line-up enter the studio; Christian, has been with the band since 1995's Cause For Conflict album and Finnish guitarist Sami Yli-Sirni&ouml; joined on the band's previous album Violent Revolution.<br /><br />Standout tracks include `Dystopia' and `Dying Race Apocalypse,' which are among the finest the band have yet to release. The overall quality of the album never really dips at all however; Enemy Of God is absolutely solid from beginning to end and doesn't have any filler or weak material to speak of.<br /><br />In summary; Kreator no longer have to live in the shadow of their 1980's heyday, the band are producing relevant and important music now, still pushing boundaries and releasing top quality albums. Enemy Of God is a strong and impressive album that is really worth giving a go, especially if you enjoyed either Violent Revolution or their career highlight Hordes Of Chaos.

B000002HRE|3.0|It's no secret that Metallica's efforts between the 1991 self-titled \\"Black Album\\", and their recent \\"return to form\\", Death Magnetic, were fraught with controversy.  Even their compilation of cover songs, Garage, Inc., was criticized for either the very choice of some of the covered artists (Nick Cave, Bob Seger), or for the execution of the covers (the Mercyful Fate medley seems to be divisive).  After Metallica alienated many fans by shifting from straight-up metal to a hybrid of metal, hard rock, and modern rock with Load, ReLoad may well have been the breaking point for many fans, given that many were undoubtedly hoping Load would merely be the band's one-off flirtation with styles that really didn't suit them.  There were rumors going around that ReLoad would be a \\"return\\" to a more epic sound.  Unfortunately, that wasn't the case, as ReLoad was literally the second half of the double album Metallica originally intended Load to be.<br /><br />In retrospect, both albums aren't quite as bad as they seemed when they first came out, in part due to the removal of emotional baggage many of us had at the time.  After all, the mid-90s were a dark time for metal fans in America, as the big labels essentially disowned metal, and many of the metal acts truly coming into their own at the time (Blind Guardian, Angra, Symphony X, Rage, Gamma Ray, Virgin Steele) were not as readily available or well known as they are now.  So, in essence, the act of Metallica abandoning the metal they were so good at was as big of a blow as the songs themselves.  Listening to both albums, it seems clear that Metallica fancied themselves ready to prove to the world that they could produce an eclectic monster of an album in the vein of \\"Physical Graffiti\\".  Unfortunately for them, Metallica is a metal band, not a broad-based hard rock band like Led Zeppelin.  Their style of riff-based writing is suited for the frantic bravado of metal, and not for more traditional verse/chorus/verse type songs, where dragging out a couple of riffs over and over again just doesn't work.<br /><br />To be fair, ReLoad is not actually awful.  Despite an awful chorus tagline, as well as clearly \\"inspiring\\" the corporate generi-metal of Nickelback, Fuel is a slickly-produced opener in the vein of crowd-pleasing hard rock.  The Memory Remains is a bottom-heavy monster that makes the interesting, if questionable, decision of trotting out former Mick Jagger protege Maryann Faithfull for backing vocals, while Devil's Dance cribs equally from Kiss and Led Zeppelin.  The Unforgiven II at first glance seems like a cheap \\"sequel\\" cash-in idea, but actually manages to work well, thanks to ornate touches such as the use of a Mellotron.  There are also some interesting attempts to broaden the band's palette, with somewhat expansive/atmospheric tracks such as Carpe Diem Baby, Where the Wild Things Are, and Fixxxer (which reminds me a little of Queen's The Prophet Song), as well as Low Man's Lyric, which is an odd, but somewhat touching ballad.<br /><br />The problem lies in part with the fact that probably around a third of the album is just out and out filler.  Prince Charming, Attitude, Better Than You......these songs are simply repetitive and uninspired.  Add to that the fact that the \\"better\\" songs on the album could've been made more complex and dynamic, but weren't, and a band that was performing incredibly stiffly and without energy, and you've got a recipe for disappointment.  If Metallica had tuned up some of the songs with promise, ditched the plain filler material, and threw a few old-school Metallica songs into the mix, they could've provided a much more respectable effort that bridged the gap between mainstream success, experimental ventures, and the band's old strengths.  It's hard to tell whether producer Bob Rock was the driving force behind the band's embrace of \\"going through the motions\\" as an art form, but given how much  better Death Magnetic turned out with Bob Rockout of the picture......well, you can draw your own conclusions.  In any case, ReLoad was the last full-on original studio release for five and a half years, and fans would have to endure the St. Anger fiasco before the band remembered what they're good at.  Still, a bit of ReLoad lives on in Death Magnetic (some of the bluesier riffs and Unforgiven III), even if vastly improved in delivery and energy, which I guess is sort of a silver lining, right?.....well, you can draw your own conclusions.

B0055B0MIO|5.0|After listening to this album a few times i can easily say that next to Ascendency this is my favorite Trivium album. The songs are much heavier and melodic as compared to those on the Crusade and Shogun. Heafy is still amazing at writing riffs and belting out screams that make it impossible to not bang your head.    1. Capsizing the Sea- The piano is really cool and creepy on this song. Its just a short intro to the album so i didnt expect much. Overall its a cool track.    2. In Waves- This song gets the album starting in perfect form. I love the simple guitar riff and the chorus gets stuck in my head for hours at a time. This song is absolutely amazing. My favorite part is around 3:30 when Heafy does the clean chorus with the muted guitars in the background.     3.Inception of the End- A heavily technical song that kicks so much ass. Another amazing mix of screams and clean vocals with a chorus that i always find myself singing along to.    4.Dusk Dismantled- This song is alright. Not as strong as In Waves or Inception of the End but overall a great track. The opening riff is sick and the deep growls give this song a great heavy/creepy feel to it.     5.Watch the World Burn- This is one of my least favorite songs on the album. I love the guitars on this song but the lyrics dont really seem to cut it for me. It just seems to fall flat to me and slightly forced. It just doesnt flow well.    6.Black- This is just the kind of fast paced ass kicking song i wanted to get from Trivium. I love this song, it has the right mix of heavy guitars and melodic singing that just seems to work well for Trivium.    7.A Skyline's Severance- This is a good song, to me it seems pretty similar to Black but just with more screaming. I like it but it doesnt seem too different.     8.Ensnare the Sun- I cant express how much i hate this song. I can respect Heafy trying to imitate bands like Opeth by bringing the acoustic guitars into a heavy album but this song is so out of place. It serves no purpose on the album and just breaks up the album for no reason. I hate bands that put little 1 minute filler songs in.    9.Built to Fall- A decent song. It has nothing special.    10.Caustic Are The Ties That Bind- This song has one of the coolest guitar parts on the CD. When the chorus kicks in it is so beautiful and melodic yet still awesome and asskicking. A great song.    11.Forsake Not The Dream- The opening sounds like it belongs in a pop-punk song then it goes into this cool melodic riff that is pretty cool but the screaming seems a little out of place over the melodic guitars.    12.Drowning In Slow Motion- The drums are insane on this track it blows my mind. This song has a really cool riff that works great with Heafy's screams and the slightly dissonant sound on his clean vocals sounds amazing on here.    13.A Grey So Dark- This song confuses me. The guitars play this amazing thrashy riff but Heafy's vocals are all clean and it just isnt very interesting. This song just isnt worth listening to.    14.Chaos Reigns-This song is pretty straightforward. Its a heavy song with alot of screaming. But when Heafy screams Chaos Reigns over and over again it seems like he is rushing and got the timing off. Maybe its just me but it sounds a little weird.    15.Of All These Yesterdays- The clean vocals on this song are absolutely amazing. No matter how many times i listen to it i cant believe its still Heafy singing there. This is probably the slowest song on the album but its so good. It has this amazing rhythm and flow to it.    16.Leaving This World Behind- What can i say.....another 1 minute filler song. It serves no purpose and shouldnt be on the album.    17.Shattering the Skies Above- This song was featured on God of War 3 and its a great solid track. It sounds more like the Trivium from Shogun to me but its still amazing none the less. The drums get a little weird at 2:10 but overall this track is really good.    18.Slave New World- A cover of a Sepultra song. I am not a fan of Sepultra at all but this cover is absolutely amazing. When the acoustic guitar came in i got chills down my spine.    Overall this album is really goood-minus the two filler songs with no purpose. I would definitely recommend that people buy this album whether they are new to Trivium or not.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|+ I have not played any tower defense style games before, but I used to play RTS games on the PC a while ago. So to me this is an introduction to this genre. I find it quite entertaining and this particular game is well done.<br /><br />+ The tower defense concept seems to me a simplified RTS where the opposing force always (or in this case mostly) comes up against you on the same path (restriction on them) and you can place your units only at the predefined spots (restriction on you).<br /><br />+ Otherwise - much like with RTS games - it is the balancing that makes or breaks the game. If the opponent are too tough, you have no choice to win, that is not much fun. But if they are too weak, than it becomes boring.<br /><br />+ In Grave Defense I like the balancing a lot. You keep getting new weapons and the opponent keep getting new unit types, so you have to pick your units carefully and place them strategically.<br /><br />+ The game also uses money (much like the various resources in RTS)  to limit you for simple units first on each map and throws easier opponent at you, then - as you collect money and can get bigger guns - you get tougher opponent.<br /><br />+ Another twist is that some of the waves switch from one path to another, so you have to place your defenses well.<br /><br />+ Overall this is a fun game that can keep you playing for some time.<br /><br />+ The implementation is nice, runs on a Nook Color with CM7 perfectly.<br /><br />+ I think it does worth the $2, although I admit I got it as free app of the day.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great series, Great book.  GRRM introduced many more plot expansions and so I'm worried that he won't be able to tie them all in by the 7th book.  Looking forward to the \\"Winds of Winter\\"
0439023513|4.0|Whoa! 1546 reviews is too many to read through, heck I barely read one review and a few of the 117 comments to that review.<br /><br />Anywho, from reading that handful of comments i see that a lot of people were dissapointed with the ending, and at first i was too, but after a few minutes of reflection, i actually love the fact that it wasn't a cliche happy ending, because in real life wars don't usually have happy endings. People are usually traumatized and broken after wars, especially the heroes.<br /><br />So for the first time Collins has actually really impressed me with this bitter sweet ending, it kind of reminds me of a Cohen Bros. film where the ending is so abrupt and real.<br /><br />Sure, earlier in the series i thought to myself that with Peeta's rhetoric he will probably become some kind of high level government official and she will end up with Gale and everyone lives happily ever after. On the contrary Collins did better, the stark harsh ending may not leave me giddy and happy for the characters, but at the same time i respect her for writing such a real ending to the series.<br /><br />Seriously, of course the characters are broken after what they have been through, but they GO ON, which is all anyone can do.<br /><br />As for Katniss' behavior in this last book, yes, i was conflicted about her lack of what to do, etc. yet again, this is so real, she is such the opposite of the Gary Stu's and Mary Lou's that we are use to seeing. Most of the time the heroes always know what to do, and they do everything so perfectly.
B0051MKMNC|5.0|Excellent movie! Well filmed, well performed, intelligent and entertaining. I really enjoyed it.     Question: Where can I buy some of those little pills????
0307454541|4.0|Although this book was slow moving at the start, once I got into it, the story was fast-paced and riveting. Stieg Larsson's characterization is incredible. I felt like I really knew the characters. A word of caution about this book...it is disturbing and dark. Quite gruesome, but extremely well written.
0553801473|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I know that many people have given it a low score, but I think you just have to read it on your own and decide.<br /><br />I started reading the series in June and had the good fortune to read it straight through to the end of ADwD. Maybe since I didn't have the frustrating wait, the slow pace of this book didn't infuriate me.<br /><br />I thought this book was written in a different fashion than the first three, but I was ok with it. I felt like the series was still coming down from all the *stuff* that happened. It is supposed to be part 2 of AFoC. Half the characters in the series still needed to react and grow.<br /><br />ADwD is a good read and I can't wait for book 6 to come out!
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|...I can safely say this is the movie of the year.<br /><br />As a die-hard Potter fan, the midnight screening of this film will forever go down as the greatest experience I've had at the cinema. Just being in the cinema with people just like me, who lived through their childhoods with these amazing characters, who became our friends we wish existed... A truly phenomenal experience. I had never felt such a sense of togetherness in my life. So to join these diehards in staying up till the very beginning of Friday, July 16th to witness this finale... I must say that experience changed my life.<br /><br />And I do not exaggerate when I call this film the best movie of 2011. Believe me, this film has it all. Action, comedy, suspense, drama, emotional connectivity, amazing performances.<br /><br />Understandably this is the shortest of all the Potter flicks- the previous movie covered 75% of the book, and so this film covers 25%... Which is a good thing because it shows Yates put effort into making this movie a big, grand finale. The movie moves at a fast pace, and boy, is that a good thing. One would worry that it would come off as rushed, but believe me, Yates did a hell of a job here. Sure some things were left out and/or changed, but obviously for pacing purposes. I am aware of the changes, but honestly, as a fan of the book, I'm glad they were made.<br /><br />The acting is what helps make this movie amazing. You could tell the actors were in a \\"alright, it's the last movie, let's live it up more than we can\\" mood. Everyone hams it up beautifully. The full power of the actors' performances is used. In my opinion, Matthew Lewis was the highlight of the movie! He always was the highlight of the other films, and this movie is no exception. He manages to ham it up as Neville Longbottom, and here he is in full badass mode.<br /><br />Really, I am still speechless as to how awesome this movie was. I mean, I knew it was going to be one emotional experience, and thank god it turned out to be that. As the movie's ending credits began rolling, I got incredibly emotional. I did not want to say goodbye to the phenomenon that helped shape my childhood. And you could feel that emotion running through the cinema, when John Williams' score rang through the speakers.<br /><br />In short, Deathly Hallows 2 is phenomenal, the best of the series, and the best film of 2011. Rarely have I connected with a movie as emotionally as I did with DH2, and that said, this was the right way for me to say goodbye to my childhood properly.<br /><br />OVERALL: 10/10<br /><br />Pros: DH2 is the perfect balance of crowd pleasing and fan service, allowing everyone to have a blast. It is a stellar finale that demands to be watched, you have no choice!<br /><br />Cons: ........uuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.....s ending credits began rolling, I got incredibly emotional.

B002JIEYLM|5.0|Again a pleasure to have this CD. The first hard rock songs that I listened thirty six years ago.  I recommend it.
1451629184|4.0|Enjoyed the book a lot. A must read for young people. Shows how strong one can be when the need arises.
0375842209|5.0|I just finished and I...am...speechless. I cried nonstop the last 50 pages of the book, but at the same time it was beautiful. The language is poignant and the point of view unique. How Death could tell the tale in such a lyrical way that touched me so deeply is beyond me.     Markus Zusak writes so beautifully, it's poetic. The characters are real and flawed and the relationships are so touching that I cared very deeply about the characters. The fact that the narrator is Death was hard to swallow at first, but it's unique and Death's thoughts are woven intriguingly through the story.     This is a must read.     \\"I am haunted by humans.\\" -Death
0553582038|4.0|I muddled through it, mostly because of the amazing ending of book 3. In all actuality, it wasn't that bad of a book, it just wasn't about the characters that I care about. If you ever wondered what was going on in Cersei's deluded mind, then you're in for a treat!    It kind of read like fanfiction. Although it was better written then most fanficition, it was based on minor characters no one really cares about.
B003AO1SVS|2.0|I gave these guys a chance because I'd heard \\"Tighten Up\\" at a pub in London, England. I loved its catchy, bluesy, bar band type sound. A few days after I got back to Canada, I searched out this album and bought it, because I really liked then sound.<br /><br />Honestly, I've listened to this disc 5 times and I still cant get into it. Nearly all the tracks sound the same. By about track 6, I'm still reminiscing on the awesomeness of Tighten Up. These guys are indeed talented, but by god, there's little to no variety in the songs on this album, I liked Never Gonna Give You Up also, but that was it.<br /><br />Maybe I need to hear the bands other stuff, but I just can't get into this disc.
B003VR5PPY|4.0|I love this game.  I'm currently on my third playthrough and taking my time to strive for the \\"good ending\\" (got 2 different bad endings so far).  I think this game does an excellent job at keeping the player intrigued with its plot.  Only gripe I have about this game is having to replay puzzles you've already solved in previous playthroughs.  Although the game does have a feature that enables you to speed through previous read texts, I wished it also allowed for skipping previously solved puzzles.  Overall great game, and I'm so glad to have found this game even if I was months late in discovering it.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|This is a pretty cool app. The best thing about the app is that you don't have to switch modes to type alphabets and numerals. You can get all from the same view. Also the word predication is pretty accurate. It has 2-3 cool layouts for the keyboard too.
B004H7QICG|4.0|Pros:  Good cable management  Easy access  Fans are fairly quiet  Solid construction    Cons:  I was looking for something even quieter, i.e. practically silent, and it isn't as quiet as my last case. That said it is much higher build quality and much better internal layout. So far the extra noise is minimal and hasn't bothered me enough to replace the stock fans. FWIW, I'm pretty picky for noise, a casual user would probably be fine with it.    Overall it's really good, although those looking for true silence would need to replace the stock fans with something even quieter.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|Bought a camera holder for myself and one for a friend. We both use a regular tripod and remove the cases from our iPhones.  Simple, cost effective and works like a charm.  Product arrived super fast.    You can get away with shooting photos without a tripod but filming iPhone video without a tripod is a very bad idea.   If you have footage shot without a tripod, you will want to check out Boris FX products to try to correct the damage.  Boris FX is not a perfect solution to shaky video but the best solution I have found so far.    Lesson learned the hard way . . . now I won't shoot without a tripod.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|My heart goes out to Jaycee and her family for what they all went through. There were times I had to put the book down because I was so upset. I can't imagine going through this terrible ordeal and I certainly couldn't imagine my daughter going through this.
B004YXE438|5.0|This is the 1st time I&apos;ve been compelled to write a review, but this games is that good. The controls are intuitive, the images are clear &amp; sharp, and you can use custom images. There is a great range of difficulty making it fun for both me &amp; my kids. I would definitely recommend this game.
B004AHNIGM|1.0|It's a shame material of this quality was recorded in what seems to be the T Bone tradition. It's great material, I only wish I could manage to sit through the booming over modulated dead muffled sound. I thought my system was broken. I then thought maybe I just got a defective copy. After two copies, and reading what other have written I'm saddened by what is a wasted effort in my opinion. I can only hope someone can and will remaster it for those of us that just can't figure out this production?
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Im a Marine in Afghanistan and I bought this at the PX. Best $7 I ever spent. This is a great sharpener. It's obviously not the most precise and finest sharpner but if your more of a practical type and you just need to shape a blade and get an edge on it quick, this is the best. Plus the round sharpner works awesome. I had a flat stone I was using but I needed something to fix the serrations on all my blades. Figured I'd give this one a try when I saw the round sharpner. Have not been disappointed. And It's durable, this thing has seen a lot of blades and it still puts an edge on a knife.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|We bought two for our City Mini Double stroller.  It was perfect and exactly what we needed.  Have owned ours for several months and it has endured folding and refolding of the stroller (I don't take it off when I store the stroller), a trip to Disneyland and a lot of other day excursions.  I will be buying a second City Mini stroller soon (single this time), and plan to purchase another one of these consoles for this stroller as well.
B000FC1LOC|4.0|I'm sure I would have enjoyed this book alot more if I hadn't already watched the movie. The ending left me disappointed.
B004QSQM72|5.0|How Wild Beasts hasn't managed to garner wider appeal in the States is beyond my ken. The U.K. band has racked up fistfuls of accolades in its homeland, and its previous album, \\"Two Dancers,\\" was nominated for the coveted Mercury Prize in 2010 (the band The xx went on to win for \\"xx,\\" frog-leaping the Pond in the process).<br /><br />This is Beasts' third offering of warm, intelligent, soulful music in the past four years, the band more finely honing its tools on each successive album. \\"Smother\\" pulsates with so much synth, and is so crisply produced, it floats and shimmers like a mirage at sea.<br /><br />Critics refer to Beasts as indie or post-punk revival, but I would categorize the band as blue-eyed soul, which, plainly put, means soul and/or R&B done by white folks. If we were standing in a record store, albums by Simply Red, George Michael and Adele -- all Brits, as well -- would be within arm's reach.<br /><br />This is lovemaking music -- but also music to quietly despair a broken heart. Like the word \\"smother,\\" the album is sometimes affectionate, and other times intrusive.<br /><br />Beasts, whose members are admittedly obsessed with sex, continues to channel the writings of Henry Miller and Anais Nin in its lyrics. The randy \\"Plaything\\" begins with \\"New squeeze, take off your chemise/And I'll do as I please\\"; the woozy \\"Deeper\\" contains the lines, \\"You plug the hole in the void/And the world parts for you/The suckin' sun in his suckin' sky/You lift him into the room.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps Beasts is doomed by its greatest asset, vocalist Hayden Thorpe's singing style. Thorpe has a theatrical falsetto warble that sometimes Hulk-hops to operatic heights. To be sure, it takes a while for the uninitiated to get in sync with the buoyant rhythm of The Voice. \\"Smother\\" is a vocal-heavy album, and that blithe, wobbly beak is telling you to like it or lump it from the get-go. The album opens with the masochistic \\"Lion's Share,\\" Thorpe out-trilling multi-octave chanteur Antony Hegarty (of Antony and the Johnsons).<br /><br />But any opposition quickly melts away on a song such as \\"Albatross,\\" a sweeping requiem to the shackles of love, the music and the vocals meshing perfectly. No other voice could create the same unsettling effect, Thorpe convincingly purling the opening line, \\"Albatross, albatross, how callous the ocean that you cross.\\"<br /><br />Other than the meandering \\"Invisible\\" and \\"Burning,\\" with bush-league bandmate Tom Fleming phoning in the lead vocals, \\"Smother\\" is a beautifully rendered work, one that shows the band continuing to flower in full bloom. The music is dense techno-soul, often resembling the musicianship of Tears for Fears on its timeless debut, \\"The Hurting.\\"<br /><br />At the last, with Thorpe repeating \\"it's too soon, it's too soon\\" on the closing track, \\"End Come Too Soon,\\" it feels like the album is wrapping up at just the right time -- like a meal that fills you up, but still lets you get back out of your chair.eur Antony Hegarty (of Antony and the Johnsons).<br /><br />But any opposition quickly melts away on a song such as \\"Albatross,\\" a sweeping requiem to the shackles of love, the music and the vocals meshing perfectly.

B000LXHK2C|4.0|Russell Crowe is always a terrific act, and this movie is just plain fun...with a message of the heart. Scenes of beauty in France don't hurt , either.
0060987464|5.0|I loved the book. It is well written and addictive - I could not sleep peacefully until I read till the end.     I particularly enjoyed the sense of humor which made me laugh a lot - like identification of a drug addict, homosexuality and cheating or passages from the diary about the taken ribs. Some ideas were memorizable and well put, other parts were disgusting and disturbing, ruthless and unjustifiably mean, but it made me remember the childhood and careless attitude to everything a child has. You do not appreciate anything. You just grow and deal with all of the mess around without stopping and thinking about anybody or anything except yourself, your great drama and upheavals of emotions swarming and depressing your mind. In a way, the book is a perfect description of growing up - from childhood to adolescence and turbulent youth.     At some points of drug induced dreams and fantasies it reads much like Naked Lunch, drugs and drugs and drugs, delirium and surrealistic reality inside an unhealthy and dazed mind which sometimes has nothing to do with real life. However, there is much more personal and understandable stuff in this book (and aimed not solely on fans, drug addicts or any other restricted audience). It is a detailed diary of expendable youth - talented and desolate, making you feel the pain of loneliness and solitude, remember all the suffering and haunting bad memories everybody has.     To sum up, the book is a great read. I enjoyed every page. I would recommend it to anyone who is not prejudiced from the start or stupid and fan enough to repeat anything written down there.
B002ZG999U|4.0|This movie was really a good surprise. Action-packed, easy to follow, this is really your Friday evening chillout movie. It was a pleasure to see Stallone come back with some high-profile names. The humour and self-satire makes the movie lighter and the violence more acceptable. Actors are well-directed and you end up the movie wanting to see more of it.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I was very hesitate about reading this book but I was so glad I did. I couldn't put this book down!!! When I had to stop reading I was wondering what happened next. I couldn't wait to pick it back up again. While reading this book, I felt as though I was there watching. The emotions from the characters was amazing. At the end when they read the verdict, I gasped for air and was happy with the way it ended. I will certainly read a book from Jodi Picoult again.
B0050I2P32|3.0|Like The Damned before them, The Horrors' sound has shifted from garage rock to dark cabaret in the space of a few years. When The Damned did it back in the late 1970s and early 1980s, it was uncharted territory, and that sense of adventure still shines through.<br /><br />\\"Skying\\" is The Horrors' ode to moody post-punk bands such as Echo & the Bunnymen, The Stranglers and My Bloody Valentine. It's a hit-and-miss affair. For instance, \\"Still Life,\\" the band's first single, while definitely radio-friendly, is predictable and overly processed. I could describe the slightly New Age, overly drawn-out krautrocker \\"Moving Further Away\\" the same way.<br /><br />Other times on \\"Skying,\\" Horrors manages to take already existing elements and mix them into fresh compounds. The quintet is well-versed in the musical styles it emulates -- and gets points for digging a bit deeper into the '80s catalog than many recent revivalists.<br /><br />The album kicks off with the breezy \\"Changing the Rain,\\" shoegaze slathered in squalling feedback, singer Faris Badwan rising above with a voice that is now reminiscent of Wayne Hussey (vocalist for The Mission UK). Long gone are the days of electric-shock hairdos and raccoon makeup, or goth-shock howlers such as \\"Sheena is a Parasite,\\" its debut single in 2006, a song that put the unknown band onto the cover of NME and catapulted it into the public eye.<br /><br />The word \\"skying,\\" according to the band, comes from an obsolete recording technique from the 1960s. Guitarist Josh Hayward is an electronics whiz, and he created homemade synthesizers based on pre-modular formulas for the making of the record. \\"Skying\\" marks the first self-produced release from the band, and it was recorded in a small studio they built themselves in London.<br /><br />\\"Skying\\" is an extension of The Horrors' last album, \\"Primary Colours.\\" Like the synth-prog epic \\"Sea Within a Sea\\" off the 2009 release, \\"Skying\\" ends with \\"Oceans Burning,\\" a sprawling, pulsating tidal wave of sound built on top of Badwan's fibrous bellow.

B000784WMW|1.0|I finally gave up on this.  Timothy Dalton did a good job but he's far too handsome for the role of Edward.  Jane was a total diappointment.  Jane is 18 years old,  very tiny,  thin and modest,  Clarke looked almost matronly.  The costumes were so far off from what the book described as her dress.  She wasn't submissive but then she wasn't a smart ass either like she plays in this movie.<br />I didn't see any \\"chemistry\\" between Dalton and Clarke.  Clarke's performance seemed like she was reading cue cards rather than acting.<br />The book is wonderful but this movie is lousy.

0071762345|3.0|Although social media has become a mainstream business strategy, there are few `how-to' books that you can hand business owners who are eager to get started with social media.  The newest of these is Likeable Social Media by David Kerpen.<br /><br />The book offers helpful examples, useful tips, marketing insights and a good index.  It's a book that's easily recommended and unlikely to offend. Anyone who's new to social media will want to pick up a copy of the book for themselves.  Experienced social media marketers may want to pick up a dozen copies of Likeable to distribute to everyone around them.<br /><br />Likeable gives  `by the book' instructions for achieving likeability -- which may be its only  shortcoming. Compared with Guy Kawasaki's  search for  `enchantment' and Scott Stratten's battle cry to  `be awesome!',  a quest for `likeability' seems unintentionally bland, dispassionate and forgettable.<br /><br />Likeable is a stand-out book, but it doesn't stand alone.<br /><br />Read more here: [...]

B0041VB8BO|5.0|I saw fun. open for Panic! At the Disco; I had never heard of them before that, and they pretty much wowed me.  So I bought their album and gave it a listen, and I tell you it is addictive.  This album is now one of my favorites.  Truly, it's a gem, fun. lives up to their name.  Happy, mellow, make you sing along and dance without realizing you're doing it kinda music.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I was very impressed with this movie.  My now fiance and I went and saw it with a couple friends one afternoon, and we all rather enjoyed it.  It's cool to see another good X-Men origins movie, much like X-Men Origins: Wolverine.  I look forward to seeing what they do next!  I will probably buy this one when it releases in Sept.
0374158460|5.0|I started this and, from the size of it, figured it would kill one summer month. WRONG! Could not put it down. It came to meals with me, to bed with me, in the car with me.   The sweeping saga of  today's families and times is all here and done exquisitely.   I had tried reading CORRECTIONS and gave up. I need to go back and try again. If it lives up to FREEDOM, I do not want to miss it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I originally started reading this series due to the hype created comparing these books to the Harry Potter series. I am a Harry Potter freak! I was very sad to see the end of that era and was looking for something to replace that gap for me. I also read it because it was a cheap buy. I figured if i could not stomach it i wasn't going to waste too much money. It turned out to be a very well written series. I started reading and could not put it down. Can not wait to see it come to live on the movie screen next year.
B005BZQS1E|2.0|Let me start by saying I am a huge Danny McBride fan, I love Eastbound & Down, and I thought Pineapple Express was hilarious.  Unfortunately, Your Highness just wasn't very funny.  It tried hard to be, you could obviously tell where you should have been laughing, but it just failed to deliver. Medieval theme + crude humor could have equaled hilarious, but it simply was not pulled off in this movie.
0451228731|4.0|Disclaimer:  I'm not quite finished reading the book yet, but I am enjoying every word (but not the pages) so far.  Here is the problem, though - this size of paperback, tall and narrow, is (to me) awful.  It greatly diminishes my reading pleasure.  I don't know why it bugs me so badly, but it does.  I find it has too little to read on each page and adapting to this irregular format is maddening.  It detracts from a wonderful story.  I'm tempted to throw it out and find a better version.  4 stars for the novel itself, minus 5 for the format.

You've made a great product that will replace all the cds I have in my car into a small compact device.

B001F6TXME|4.0|I own both the MC-DC2 release cord as well as the [[ASIN:B00007EDZG Nikon ML-L3 Wireless Remote Control for Select Nikon D-SLR and CoolPix Cameras]]. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.  While my camera has an IR sensor on both the front and the back for use with the ML-L3, I find myself taking out the MC-DC2 a lot more often.  With the MC-DC2, I never have to worry if the shot is being taken or not.  It is physically connected to the camera, and feels like any other shutter release on the camera itself.  With the ML-L3, sometimes I find I'm not in the right position and I have to press it multiple times.  And if I don't get it in time, the camera will stop seeking the remote and I'll have to go back to it to get the remote to work again.<br /><br />The MC-DC2 also has a sliding latch that will lock the shutter release in place for when you want to do longer exposures (set the camera to bulb).  It's handy to have, but I once had someone mistake it for a safety and decided to lock it down while in continuous shutter mode.  I came back to find dozens of the same shot had filled my cards.<br /><br />A remote shutter release such as this one (or even the ML-L3) is used primarily to reduce camera shake.  Coupled with a camera that has a mirror-up mode and a very sturdy tripod, this should significantly reduce vibrations, resulting in crisper landscapes and possibly better portraits.<br /><br />The cord it comes with is of decent length, but certainly does not match the distance the wireless ML-L3 is capable of.  The cord thickness is decent as well, I'd like it to be a bit thicker but I think I'll manage. Having the connector at a right-angle pointing down would have been nice, but I suppose it only works to relieve tension when the camera is in landscape.<br /><br />If it could change my shutter, aperture and ISO from the release cord then I'd be set, but all in all, it's a still worthy investment if you aren't shooting hand-held.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|Diana Krall is one of the most extraordinary personalities to come into the music scene.  Now that she has worked so hard to assemble a lovely range of tunes, this is really the best choice for anyone who want to introduce themselves to her great sound.      She reminds me of many afternoons watching the sailboats cruise out of Shilshole Marina in Seattle, and not far from her Vancouver B.C. home.  She just seems like the right person to hear as she whispers in your ear on a Sunday afternoon on the couch.    Obviously, I like her and hope she keeps working up her sound as she ages in to one of the biggest names we have around.

B00005JLF5|5.0|Typically, the first season of each Star Trek series is considered the worst, loaded with bombs and half-developed characters (remember \\"The Naked Now\\" from TNG). While DS9's first season is probably the weakest of its run, it's still an incredibly strong season. The show started on strong footing. The characters are all forceful and well defined pretty early on - aside from Dax, whom the producers admit they took a while to nail down. This first season has a few less-than-stellar episodes, but surprisingly few. By contrast, it's more often remembered for great episodes like \\"The Vortex,\\" \\"Captive Pursuit,\\" \\"Progress,\\" and \\"In the Hands of the Prophets.\\" The series pilot, \\"The Emissary,\\" was a fine episode on its own. However, the pinnacle of the season - and perhaps the series - is \\"Duet,\\" where a Cardassian tries to atone for his planet's war crimes. That episode alone is worth the price of admission (if that episode didn't force you to change your mind about Cardassians, then nothing will). Overall, a very strong start.

B003EYVXSW|2.0|Two scientists engaged in a dna splicing program decide to go the extra step by secretly adding some human genetics to the monstrous melange. Disaster ensues... but the plot takes a turn for the worse as well.<br /><br />This movie can't decide what it wants to be... part science fiction, part horror, part family drama, part social commentary. It collapses under its own weight from the writers trying to shoe-horn every little bit of scrap into it. They seem to think this is something \\"profound\\" in the way of being a self-perceived indictment of science playing God, but it just comes off as being pretentious and scatterbrained.<br /><br />The film never engaged me and is ultimately forgettable, but for now it's enough in my memory to leave a lingering aftertaste of annoyance. I've seen worse things (which is why I'll give it 2 stars) but there's no question there's better things out there to waste an evening on.
B0049GYXDQ|1.0|Terrible movie.  Besides a couple of \\"ok\\" songs the rest is horrible.  One of the worst movies Disney has ever put out.  This is pure crap that makes even makes Mulan look good.  Even using this movie in the same sentence as the Little Mermaid or Lion King is a disgrace.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|There really isn't too much to say here. With only a 4k transfer rate and a lack of special features...why would I (or you) shell out another $90.00 for a poor reworking of a classic? Furthermore, it is only 5.1 surround sound and not 7.1. In fact, it isn't even the classic episodes 4-6, it is the new versions with too much cgi and Hayden appearing as the ghost of Anakin at the end. Please, do yourself a favor and don't buy this...for yourself, or your kids. IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY. Wait a year or two when a collector's edition comes out with what everyone is waiting for (like the original edition).
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I really like Anthony Bourdain's attitude toward food and I found the story of his rise through the culinary world very interesting.

B0040QYROK|4.0|This movie has one of the cheesiest morals ever. Let's just get that right out in the open. The message of this film is silly. However, the way it goes about telling the story is genius. In terms of visual storytelling only \\"[[ASIN:B002J91V3A Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans]]\\" is better.<br /><br />At some point in the future, there are those who have wealth, live above ground and up in tall skyscrapers and who provide the engineering and innovation that creates the city; and there are those who are poor and live below ground and who are tasked with the manual labor that keeps the city of Metropolis running. The son of one of the wealthy is confronted one day by the sight of a woman bring the poor children up to see how the wealthy live. This sparks in him the desire to see how the poor live, and that journey triggers a series of events that includes visions of Biblical proportions, the jealousies of a mad scientist, a machine woman used to corrupt a peaceful and growing protest movement, and a social revolution. Yet strangely, aside from a caution about being sent to live as a laborer, there is no mention of social mobility. The laborers are still to be the laborers. The innovators are still to be the innovators. They just need a mediator, according to the movie. As I said, the message is silly.<br /><br />Anyway, the film tells its story beautifully. You get shots of a crowded cityscape that is like New York of the 1920s on steroids. You see huge machines with people working on them. You see decadence that seems like a twisted view of the 1920s. You see a robot transformed into the image of a woman. You get a strange telling of the Tower of Babel. And all with technical skill of composite shots and special effects that would go almost without comment in a movie of today.<br /><br />And this is all in blu-ray. Which means defects in the original film are more evident, and yet for much of the movie the image is sharp and clean. There are damaged parts, unfortunately,but they do not overwhelm the viewing experience. Kino has done an excellent job of bringing this film to modern technology.
B00111YM5G|2.0|This was a strange, strange film.  Not in a 'Rocky Horror Picture Show' or 'Army of Darkness' kind of cult-strange (which I adore in all of its campy awfulness), but just strange.  Lots of potential here, but the film was bogged down by some truly awful acting.  The lead character, Gabriel, is a decent actor, and so were the actors depicting Uriel and Raphael (very minor characters unfortunately), but the rest were just mediocre and the guy depicting Sammael was a truly awful cartoon of a villain.  The love interest is just so-so given the potential of the set of circumstances she was given to work with and the love scene is truly ... bland.  Given the R rating, they should have spiced things up.    I probably should have rated this only one star, but the depictions of Purgatory and the sense of helplessness and hopelessness depicted by some of the most minor characters, many of them simply 'extras' without a single spoken line, earned it the second star.  The whorehouse bouncer was kind of funny.  The children without lines ... there was more acting in those tormented kids faces than most of the major characters.  Purgatory as depicted in this movie just seemed far more real than the purgatorio painted by Dante and numerous old testament and mythological rantings.
B002E2QHBS|5.0|Just made my way through the 6 CDs and I enjoyed every minute of this new \\"highlights\\" from Woodstock box set.  First off, most of these selections have been remixed from the original 8 channel multi-tracks that were recorded on site in 1969.  The sound is superb, you feel like you are sitting right on the edge of the stage.  The discs unfold in chronological order with key tracks from all the artists who played at Woodstock except for three (The Band, Ten Years After and the Keef Hartley Band).  You really get a sense of how the 3 days and nights played out.  There are also 5 artists who have had their entire sets released in conjunction with this set called The Woodstock Experience. Those artists are Janis Joplin, Jefferson Airplane, Johnny Winter, Sly & the Family Stone, and Santana, all remixed in 2009.  After hearing these highlights and the Sly set, I wish they could have issued more complete sets from the Who, CSN&Y, Country Joe and the Fish, and Joe Cocker.  There is an older Joe Cocker live at Woodstock CD but it is in bad need of a remix.  And Hendrix and Santana have had Woodstock sets issued before.<br /><br />The book that comes with the set is nice, photos of all the artists, complete liner notes as to who was playing and what and also the complete set lists from 1969 so you can see where the highlights fit into the whole set.<br />I would recommend you get the book by Michael Lang, the \\"Road to Woodstock,\\" as he talks about all the music as he remembers it happening plus quotes from the artists who were there.<br /><br />Anyway, great box set, Rhino records really did a great job with this.  Plus the original Woodstock albums also were reissued in 2009 if you'd like to hear those again.  Highly recommended.

B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Granted, having seen the Firefly TV show first helps, but it is not necessary to enjoy this film. Smugglers at the edge of society find one of the crew is not what she seems, and are hunted by a government operative willing to do anything to achieve his goal. There is a scene where the government operative tells the captain of the smugglers, \\"You cannot beat us.\\" And the reply of the captain is, \\"Got no need to beat you. Just want to go my way.\\" That sums up the stances of the two sides perfectly. The one thing that disappoints me about this epic story is that it was squeezed into two hours. It needs a little more breathing room.<br /><br />The blu-ray edition is beautiful. The details are sharp and clear, just as one expects from blu-ray. The extras are fun. The cast commentary can be audio only or watched picture-in-picture style. There are deleted scenes, out-takes, and plenty of extras detailed elsewhere. The cast commentary is one of the most entertaining commentaries I've heard. The film out-takes are funny. The film is grand in scope and well executed. This is not a religious film, but it is a film about belief and love. There is a political aspect to the message of the film as well, but it does not beat the viewer about the head and shoulders. This is a movie made to be entertaining, not to convert anyone. Which is as it should be. The bottom line is, this movie and the extras are a lot of fun. Sit back, relax, and enjoy it.
B000O179EK|5.0|Watch this movie one time and you'll probably not like it.  Watch it again and you'll think it has a few funny moments.  Watch it about 5 more times and you'll realize you're watching a masterpiece.    This is one of the most deceptively clever, funny, deep and interesting movies ever.  It should not be surprising that it has a huge cult following of die hard Lebowskis.    I don't see a need to give a synopsis as the actions in the movie aren't what is important - they will probably seem disjointed and irrelevant the first time you watch it so try not to pay too much attention to them.    Please, watch this movie at least 3 times before you try to classify it and you'll love it.
B004EPYZOO|5.0|I have found anything that Nicholas Cage is in is never never boring. He really plays this one to the core. I have watched this one three times and still find it very interesting. Don't care a lot of the sex parts of the movie. It's a get down bad and dirty movie. No child should ever watch this one.This is close to the version Ghost Rider. And I loved that movie even more. Good verses evil.

B001993Y3G|4.0|I love this movie, it's my favorite version of Robin Hood. So far my only disappointment with this is the soundtrack. It is uneven. Sometimes when they talk the soundtrack goes so muted I can hardly hear them, then suddenly the sound level is booming. I haven't experienced this kind of unevenness in soundtrack on any other DVD, especially a Blue Ray at that.
B001U6YI92|5.0|These old Clint Eastwood movies will never get old.  This was on sale during one of Amazon's Lightning deals of the day and I was able to snag it.

Now I just have to wait until some of his other movies show up on the deals of the day.
B000002U82|5.0|When I drive somewhere this is the Album I listen to. forget the radio. This is my favorite rock band and album of all time! I love Breathe reprise and the end of Eclipse! when I start this album I almost feel like somethings missing... like a joint hahaha. can't do that though. I enjoy it, I lean back and breathe. I Love Pink Floyd's style of music, laid back and to be honest it sounds like they were high when they wrote some of the music which i'm sure they were lol. great album most definitely! I Love it.
B004XE0P5E|5.0|sheer awesome, in the end.  takes a few listenings for it to worm its way into your DNA but this is manifestly the work of an awakening giant.  I can't wait to see what he does next!  There are precious few albums in the history of popular music (including For Emma...) that I embrace as a WHOLE...  but this set has zero weak links.  It is, in essence, a tone piece, a mood, a universe that you want to return to again and again, and there's always something new to be found there.  I marvel continuously at all the Justin Vernons involved -- the writer, the singer, the musician, and on this album especially, the producer.

1451629184|4.0|After seeing the news story about Jaycee Dugard being kidnapped at age 11 and held captive for 18 years, I wasn't sure I wanted to read her book because the abductor was such a slime ball but I am glad I did.  This is a fascinating book. I was pleasantly surprised that although she did not have freedom, she was not tortured too much. She cooperated so he would not get mad and so she could survive. It did surprise me though that she didn't even think about ways to escape. I was so happy that she had kittens and a bird to keep her company. Phillip raped her and she became a 14-yr.-old mother of a healthy baby girl and had another later too. These girls brightened her life.<br /><br />\\"A Stolen Life\\" reminded me of \\"ROOM\\" by Emma Donoghue except that was fiction and this is not.  \\"A Stolen Life\\" is a heartbreaking story while she was in captivity, but fortunately it has a happy ending.
0894803123|5.0|This is a great ice cream and desert recipe book. For beginners and beyond, the recipes are easy and the finished product tastes great! I highly recommend this book. If you only buy one ice cream recipe book, let it be this one! If you buy two books, I also recommend \\"The Perfect Scoop: Ice Creams, Sorbets, Granitas, and Sweet Accompaniments,\\" which is also a great ice cream recipe book with easy recipes (and there are many, MANY recipes to try in that one).

It works great and so I will be happy to give her hers when the time comes!  I sometimes get a bit of static, but that may be because I haven't taken the time to find the perfect frequency to use. I've been using a USB stick, but plan to take a little time and choose the perfect play list to put on an SD card.  The USB is a little awkward.  It worked fine with my ipod nano, but use that elsewhere, so will make the SD card my permanent source.

0307477479|1.0|I enjoy the music scene. I am comfortable with books that are non traditional in their approach (I.e. chapter written in PowerPoint).  I like character driven novels. But this book just didn't work for me on any level. Unlikeable and tired characters paired with forced quirkiness yielded a huge miss  for me. Bummer as I had high hopes for this one.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|If your a fan on Nikki Sixx and want to listen to a cd about his life and battle with drugs then this is a great cd. Its a soundtrack to his book the heroin diaries. The music is great and the lyrics are scary in a way that some one lived this way. But at the same time if makes you feel good because its such a scary and sad way of life but Nikki lived through it all and is around now days to share his story with us. Like I said if your a fan you will enjoy it. My order shipped the same day I placed my order and was here within 3 days. Great product and great turn around time.
1594744769|2.0|Note:  This is a spoiler-free review.    Based on glowing reviews and interesting cover art, I was pretty excited to read this one.  Well, almost immediately, it became painfully apparent that I was in for disappointment.      One of my biggest pet peeves with books is inconsistency of voice.  The narrator of this story is all over the place in terms of tone and style and simply sounds ridiculous half the time.  The author seemed hell-bent on using as many adjectives as humanly possible, but to little effect.  Rather than building a captivating world for readers to fall in love with and explore, he wastes a ton of time describing things that either don't matter one bit or that I already know what they look like.  Moreover, if the author wanted to include lengthy sections of florid prose, he shouldn't have used first-person narration.  It made me disconnect from the narrator and felt disingenuous.  No one talks like that, no one tells a story like that, and no one spends an entire paragraph describing the state of the floorboards.  Beyond that, the author has incorporated numerous old photographs into the book (like the one on the cover), but then goes on to describe everything that's in the picture.  If he was going to include the picture anyway, why on earth did he spend so much time describing it?  The author got bogged down with the photographs.  On the one hand, they ended up being the most interesting part of the book, but they felt inorganic and forced.  The author continually seemed to be conjuring reasons to include the photographs, rather than using them to supplement the story.    What's worse, even though many of the things the narrator described were fantastical and bizarre, and the photos were odd and interesting in and of themselves, I still found myself completely bored.  Indeed, until I was about 150 pages in, I could barely bring myself to continue.  I kept hope alive that it would get better, and finally, after way too long, it began to pick up.  As the novel progressed, the author finally seemed to relax and settle into the narrative itself, rather than the flowery narration.  The voice of the narrator began to feel more genuine and the story itself finally found some footing.  That said, it improved to the point that I finished it, but I wouldn't recommend this book.  Even after if improved, I found that I hardly cared about any of the characters and wasn't very invested in their fates.  In a weird way, the narrator himself was one of the least compelling characters in the book, and one that I felt I knew the least.  With him being the narrator, I should have known him intimately by the end, but either I simply didn't connect with him or there wasn't much to connect to.      At the end of the day, this novel felt more like a high school writing assignment rather than a bestseller.  I think the author has some potential, but he has a long way to go before he can craft a story that will warrant a second read.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Well, I was so impressed with the first 3 books in the series. Book four was mostly a big setup for what I had hoped would be an Epic Book Five. I am just so disappointed by how weak and pitiful all of my favorite heroes and villains have become... I feel cheated... I was bored and found myself skimming.
B002ZG994U|5.0|I watched the origional The A-team before seeing this movie. They are different in many ways, but the movie completely rocks! I loved all the actors and the thought they were magnificent and funny. The creators and directors did a wonderful job as well. Many people complain that the movie isn't like the series, and that the characters don't behave the same, but that is their own opinion. This movie is its own A-team. It brings action, teammates and friends, twists, funny characters, and \\"A\\" wonderful performance by all in it. I gave the a-team an \\"A\\" plus. I hope they make a second!

If you like Nikki Sixx and enjoy rock that tells a story and the music has heart pick them up. The order shipped they day I ordered it and was at my place in less then 2 days. Thanks for the great rock.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|These events happened during my lifetime and I was sickened then by the prejudice against blacks that I witnessed as a young adult, but this is the first time I was able to hear the story of the black maids who raised white women's children. It was an exceedingly well told and well acted story with great emotion as well as great humor, and it moved me profoundly. I hope we watch, learn, and do not repeat these patterns today. I am thankful for white people who loved human beings and were color blind, at a time when they too were persecuted for making that choice.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|I'm pretty terrible at puzzle games, and these are definitely challenging.  That said, it's a simple enough mechanic that you can wrap your head around what you're trying to do, even if the solution isn't obvious.  I am partially color-blind, so occasionally, it's difficult for me to tell the difference in colors, but there's not a lot I can do about it.  It's the nature of the game!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is a true story which I found enlightening because we have some autism in the family with a grandson and niece who have Ausburgers. The story is done very well and helps us understand a little more about this challenge. I highly recommend this movie, (which I heard is more enjoyable than the book), to anyone that works or interacts with autistic individuals.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|I need to get a tablet just so I can use this app on it.  The app includes recipes, photos, videos, a shopping list feature, and more.  If you enjoy cooking, it's well worth a look.  The one thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the length of the recipes.  Sure, it takes you 20 minutes to make the meal, but reading through the long list of components makes it take about that long just to collect everything and prepare before you even start making the meal.  A real cook (i.e. not me) would probably have these components readily available, but for the lay-person, it can be daunting to look down the recipe list.      Still, the recipes are detailed, the images are gorgeous, and the videos are very helpful (and only download if you want them to).  If you like cooking, it's worth a look!

B000002J1O|5.0|There is no doubt that Genesis of the 80's has a lot of fans, but in my opinion, if you really want to hear Genesis at its finest, one has to go back to the days when Peter Gabriel fronted the group.  Released on October 12th, of 1973, \\"Selling England by the Pound\\" was the firth studio album from the group.  With a feel of returning to England's better days, the album has just eight tracks, ranging in length from a 1 minute 32 second \\"Aisle of Plenty\\" to \\"The Battle of Epping Forest\\" at nearly 12 minutes long.      The album opens with \\"Dancing with the Moonlit Knight\\", a song which opens a cappella and quickly changes into a frenzy of music and very much a rock piece.  This song is also one of the bookends of the album as its reprise titled \\"Aisle of Plenty\\" closes the album with the same melody, though certainly a different lyric and feel.  Next comes \\"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)\\", an unusual single which gave Genesis its first taste of the charts.  \\"Firth of Fifth\\" is next, and it is a superb example of a progressive rock number, with tremendous musical segments featuring Tony Banks and Steve Hackett.  The first half closes with \\"More Fool Me\\", the only song on the album that has Phil Collins handling the lead vocals, and only one of two that Phil sang lead on while Peter Gabriel was in the group.  It is a stark contrast to the rest of the album as it is just vocals and acoustic guitar.     \\"The Battle of Epping Forest\\" is the longest song on the album, and has Peter Gabriel changing his voice to represent different characters during the song.  Overall the song has some interesting lyrics and fine music, but the two don't always fit together all that well.  \\"After the Ordeal\\" is an instrumental written mostly by Steve Hackett.  Supposedly Banks and Gabriel wanted to keep the piece off the album, but somewhat surprisingly Hackett prevailed.  \\"The Cinema Show\\" is next and like \\"Firth of Fifth\\" represents the height of progressive rock, and in this case the lyrics hold up to the level of the music as well.  The transition at the end of \\"The Cinema Show\\" leads into \\"Aisle of Plenty\\", a reprise of the melody from \\"Dancing with the Moonlit Knight\\" providing a very appropriate close for the album.    This album features Genesis' legendary lineup with Peter Gabriel (lead vocals, flute, oboe, percussion), Steve Hackett (guitars), Phil Collins (drums, percussion, backing vocals, and lead vocals on \\"More Fool Me\\"), Mike Rutherford (bass guitar, bass pedals, rhythm guitar), and Tony Banks (piano, keyboards, backing vocals, and acoustic guitar on \\"The Cinema Show\\").  This album is right up there with the best that Genesis has ever done.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Never bought any Adelle album's before this one, but I heard my wife listening to this one and had to buy it for myself.  Fantastic mix of her soul music and almost Joplin like vocals (but cripser).  5 stars.
B001AQT0OU|1.0|Since this release of Kubrick's masterpiece was so recent, I expected that the poor quality of earlier releases on DVD would have been addressed. After all, who at the studios would in their right minds release a BluRay of this timeless and visually fantastic work with poor quality?<br /><br />Well, my trust in the good sense (and art appreciation) of the studios was terribly misplaced. The BluRay quality of this release (Amazon Exclusive - 11 May 2011) is atrocious! It looks more like a VHS version transferred directly to BluRay. It is not even DVD quality! Why bother?? It is an insult to Kubrick and his meticulous filmmaking.
0345522478|1.0|Character is supposed to appear 21 physically while is actually from the iron age. I wish the author had chosen 28-32 age range instead because men aren't really developed until closer to 30. (If you peaked at 21 that is just sad.) The character acted and thought like a teenager. The character was not attracted to the witch that appeared to be his age because she was actually 90? (oh the irony) Then the fantasy you have to want to follow is you can hit a girl because she is a witch and the rest of the book is spent justifying it.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|my main beef with the comedies of the last decade is lack of eccentricity in main characters. the ultimate concern is about making them relatable to the average viewer to the point that every new comedy that comes out is about the same stock character. bad teacher's elizabeth halsey is a welcome antidote and makes this the best movie i've seen in years.   she's a sociopathic social climber but too lazy and impulsive to hold up a wholesome facade. sees any expectation anyone puts on her as a nuisance to be only begrudgingly dealt with if it absolutely can't be ignored. the jokes really spring from the characters psychology and develop it rather than just being contextless asides. the central conflict between the bad teacher and the good teacher also derives most of its comedy from the good teacher struggling to maintain her own good-natured facade while seething with resentment over what she sees the bad teacher getting away with. which makes it hard to not end up rooting for the bad teacher, cuz at least she's not a hypocrite. that's what i found the most intelligent about the movie, the way it ends up making you root for the most obnoxious character by setting up all the more respectful characters as hypocrites and losers. i think its pretty realistic how the average citizens are shown to unravel rather than stand with conviction when faced with adversity. and hilarious.
0142410373|3.0|This book is definitely a classic. In my opinion it is quite different from the movie, but it is still cute. This is one of those books that I probably wouldn't read again but it is still a book that's worth reading at least once.

B005BW15XS|4.0|I bought this album on a whim, but now I can't get enough of it! It has a little bit of everything - pop, techno, R&B, hip-hop - but overall it definitely has a pop feel and Kelly really knows how to dominate that genre. Several tracks (Turn it Up, Work It Man, Lay It on Me) would be great for the club. My only complaint is the \\"turn the lights on/off\\" phrase that is said on just about every song... really, what is the point of that? It must be the producer's trademark or something, but I hated that phrase when I heard it on Beyoncé's song \\"Sweet Dreams\\" last year and I hate it even more when it's repeated on every track of an album.      Standout tracks: Each Other, Motivation, Feelin Me Right Now, Turn it up, Down for whatever    Pass on: Commander (I swear this track is at least a year old, because I've heard it before, and I still can't stand it), Heaven & Earth (underwhelming ballad), I'm Dat Chick (ugh... immature and irritating sound)
B000Q04XDY|4.0|Lots of info in this book.  Seems the \\"peace loving Muslims\\" are not so peace loving after all.  It is hard reading though.  It has a lot of stuff from the Koran and other historic islamic writings, that, like the Bible, require a lot of re-reading to get to exactly what is being said.  Good book, especially if you are interested in the dark side of Islam
B001G9FFIQ|1.0|Musically, I would give this album 4 out of 5.  I love the songwriting.  Even though most complaints for this album have to do with the self-defeatist approach to the production, it doesn't bother me too much.    Unfortunately, Amazon lists reviews of different formats for the same album together, which is dumb.  I really wanted to give 1 star for this particular vinyl edition.  This album sells itself in a way that is almost fraudulent by printing on the wrapping how it was half-speed mastered from the original studio masters, something that would be as close as listening to the original reel-to-reel tape playback in the studio after the final mix was done.  But it sounds horrifying! It is mastered low yet still manages to distort somehow(?!) Even worse: vinyls have greater high frequency range for playback than cd format, but the high end on this vinyl is the worst part.  My copy sounds like a worn-out cassette tape, with the high end \\"swirling\\" in and out through the recording.      This is the type of thing that never should have been released.  If Metallica condoned this edition of ...And Justice on vinyl, then they must have intentionally set out to rip their fans off.  I guess the 4 EP version of ...And Justice sounds incredible though, too bad it costs over twice as much to buy.
B000026OWF|5.0|Man-Child is by NO means a decline in quality compared to Sextant, Head Hunters or Thrust.  No way.  This makes four golden, MUST OWN Herbie Hancock albums from the early to mid 70's.    Man-Child is obviously funkier than the three albums I mention in the sentence above, but it's honestly not a distraction to the overall pleasant, richly rewarding and surprisingly diverse listening experience I've had with this album.      \\"Hang Up Your Hang Ups\\" is a fairly ordinary song (by Herbie Hancock standards, of course) with the funky rhythm leading into a saxophone jam a few minutes later, and a really good keyboard jam at the end that wouldn't have bothered me at *all* had it lasted a few minutes longer.  It's really appealing.  After this, the album gets fairly interesting as far as diversity is concerned because \\"Sun Touch\\" is a REALLY good, mellow take on the mid 70's light jazz genre with the delicate keyboards tapping along quietly and softly through the entire 5 minute song.  Somehow though, I absolutely love it.  Every single note works wonders and really takes my adventurous mind to somewhere... tropical perhaps?  Hawaii?  Everything takes me to Hawaii these days!    \\"Traitor\\" is 10 minutes of pure funk.  Not much in the way of instrumental variety, especially during the second half when the song basically consists of nothing but fairly ordinary keyboard work and more funkiness to carry us through.  It's not boring though.  Not at all.  Of course you'll have to be a big funk fan to really appreciate a song like this, otherwise, yeah, you WILL probably get bored with it after a couple minutes.  The surprise highlight is \\"Bubbles\\".  It's the second exceptionally mellow song here, definitely providing the listener with thoughts of a peaceful, secluded location somewhere in the tropics.  I can't really explain exactly why I love this song as much as I do.  Expect a dreamy atmospheric tone for 9 straight minutes, but also expect some pleasant melodic variety of instrumental playing as well.  The brief, though effectively melodic saxophone near the beginning is one such amazing moment, and the melodic guitar solos really jump out to me later on.  You have to be patient and WAIT for these moments to arrive of course, since 9 minutes of nonstop dreaminess doesn't exactly scream \\"instantly enjoyable\\".      \\"Steppin' In It\\" is another funky number, but this time seems to have been strongly influenced by Stevie Wonder and his harmonica work, because the harmonica jam sounds remarkably similar to Stevie's classic 70's work (and dare I say, might even be slightly more melodic?)   Other than that, the keyboards contain a fair amount of melody as well.  \\"Heartbreat\\" features another -you guessed it- keyboard solo.  Yes, the album is loaded with keyboards and funky rhythms above everything else, but it's highly enjoyable so I can't complain.  That makes FOUR straight Herbie Hancock albums I have given 5 stars.  What a fantastic musician.
0805209999|5.0|(NOTE: This is a review of the book by Kafka, not this particular translation.  I place it here because I feel this is the only place where it would be visible -- the other editions of the book on Amazon have almost no reviews.  My translation, which I highly recommend, was by Willa and Edmin Muir in the 1984 Shocken paperback, which can be found here: [[ASIN:0805204164 The Trial]] .)<br /><br />Such are the words of Titorelli, the eponymous artist of the \\"Painter\\" chapter in Kafka's classic novel of despair and confusion.  Well, that's a bit disingenuous - all of Kafka's books were stories of despair and confusion, with the creeping and phantasmagoric horror of nightmares.  Not all of them, however, have the hypnotic quality of The Trial, which even in its incomplete and fragmentary state manages to capture its protagonist's descent into madness (or enlightenment?) with a disconcerting precision.<br /><br />The Trial is the story of K., who wakes up one morning in his boarding house room to find that agents of a mysterious Court want to arrest him for an unspecified crime.  The arrest, however, seems as much a formality as an indictment - K. is allowed to live and work as normal while the proceedings of his case continue behind closed doors.  K.'s attitude toward his case evolves as the process itself stagnates, running the gamut from hysteria to blas&eacute; dismissiveness to self-righteousness to (finally) despair.  He comes across a set of characters whose lives are tangled inscrutably with the case and the mysterious Court, though Kafka does not focus on any one of them for long.  In this way, the novel is episodic: we observe K.'s interactions with the Court and its functionaries in brief windows resembling short stories until, at last, the bureaucratic machinery ticks into place and K. finds himself confronting oblivion.<br /><br />Part of the mystique of the book stems from our attempts to parse exactly what the Painter is on about.  New or cursory readers of Kafka's book tend to place their emphasis upon the dystopian elements of the Court: its omnipresence, its irascibility, its brutal dismissal of K.'s human worth.  While these are certainly valid observations, they do not fully capture the nature of the Court as Kafka describes it.  For while it is certainly an oppressive and monolithic institution, it is also a massively dysfunctional one.  K. observes to his disgust that this Court seems to have no one jurisdiction, with offices housed in the attics of tenements and abandoned buildings.  Corruption seems to be rampant, and the bureaucratic measures taken by Court functionaries lack any methodology or sense.  The particular brand of Bureaucratese that they speak smacks of a more benign Newspeak - less insidious only because one gets the impression the speaker doesn't know any more than you what he's talking about.  During his conversations with lower functionaries, they assure him that the Lawyers and the Judges know the true nature of the Court; during his conversation with his experienced but senile Lawyer, however, it is revealed that experienced lawyers are so mired in the legal complexities of the system that they must often consult figures lower on the totem pole to try and get a sense of what any given case actually means.  While we never do meet the Judges, who seem to be almost metaphysical figures, one gets the distinct impression that this incompetence goes all the way up to the top.<br /><br />So what, then, is the Court?  It becomes clear over the course of the story that Kafka isn't really talking about a court of law, or at least not exclusively.  The Court appears in impossible places (a closet and a church among them), has functionaries whose jobs defy logic, issues indictments for a crime whose guilty verdict is inescapable except through delaying the case perpetually.  We never do find out what K. is accused of, but there are tantalizing hints.  If, after all, the Court is an at least partiallymetaphysical entity, then its jurisdiction must be the fundamental stuff of life.  Indeed, every character in the book speaks in long, rambling dissertations that remind one of witness testimonies, as if they were documenting evidence for K.'s case.  In a way, the specific charge does not matter: as a parable told toward the end of the book demonstrates, the point seems to be that Justice - as an abstract ideal, as something to strive for - is ultimately unattainable.  It is only with this sentiment in mind that the dysfunctions of the Court (in spite of its seeming absolute power), K.'s inability to have a true romantic relationship with Ms. Burstner, and the various conflicted states of the many characters all make a sort of twisted sense - the universe they inhabit is inherently predisposed against consummation and catharsis, dooming them instead to anxiety and despair.  It is a nightmare's anarchy, the meaningless chaos of a fever dream.  Perhaps K.'s only real crime is that he exists, and that is enough.<br /><br />And so we are left wondering: if this is the state of the world sketched in The Trial, could it also be the state of our own universe?  Are all our institutions - spiritually and worldly, political and philosophical - doomed to the uselessness of the Court by the very nature of existence?  Kafka provides no concrete answers, only dream-logic and the inescapable sensation of acute despair.  Albert Camus, according to the back cover of my edition, once said, \\"Everything in [The Trial] is, in the true sense, essential.  It states the problem of the absurd in its entirety.\\"  A fitting analysis, but misleading in that Kafka was no philosopher, much less an existentialist.  Kafka's genius was his ability to express the spiritual core of Camus' or Sartre's Big Ideas - existential despair, the Absurd, Authenticity and the lack thereof, etc. - in stories that make one feel them rather than just understand them intellectually.  He had no need of Theory; an expert of the macabre fable, he needed only his own tortured experience and the limitless expanse of his imagination.tion must be the fundamental stuff of life.

1594744769|5.0|When I saw the cover for Miss Peregrin'e Home For Peculiar Children, I was intrigued. At the Steampunk World's Fair I was shown a sneak peek of some of the photographs included in the book.  I love photography and these pictures are mystifying, surreal, and well, just cool! Ransom Riggs, the author, came across the photos and put together a wonderful story.      I received the novel, saw the print and thought, Oh no! How am I going to get through it? The type is small and it feels like a textbook! However, I was hooked right away. The story is told through the main character, Jacob Portman, who is thoughtful, astute and introspective. Jacob has an easy style of speaking and he drew me right into his tale. After several pages, I appreciated the format. I realize now the intent is to model an \\"old fashioned\\" book and it lends itself to the story, of discovering a piece of history, of unlocking a mystery.     Some books I race through and some books I savor because I want to think about what's happening. This book I definitely savored. It's going to sound really weird, but I found myself just sort of...running my hands over the pages every now and then. The type of paper the book is printed on, the photos and other graphics, (letters, book covers, chapter titles) are a perfect fit.     I love how Jacob describes the photo he sees and then I was able to view it as well.  The pictures make it real and are almost jarring because I didn't imagine the descriptions anymore. I saw them. They are even more mysterious and eerie than I visualized. The plot is intriguing and the mythology created is clever and original. I had no trouble suspending my disbelief.  I accepted everything the story presented to me without a question or raised eyebrow.  The suspense is a low hum that resonates at the beginning and gets louder as more of the story and secrets are revealed.  Each chapter ending had me wanting to read the one after. The writing itself is lovely. \\"Pessimistic weather.\\" That is a phrase in the book that I can't get out of my head. There are many tidbits like this throughout where the author uses common words to thread together a lovely image.  I won't go too much into the rest of the cast of characters because I don't want to give too much away, but they are believable and likeable.    What I also appreciated is the inclusion of World War II and the Holaucaust. This story isn't about those events, but they intertwine within the story. As time marches on I wonder how removed that part of history will be in our culture so I am happy they play a role in this story. I love how Jacob remembers what his grandfather went through and is able to find his own courage and his own path in life.     This is a well crafted, thoughtful and fun book and it is clear that a lot of care went into every aspect, from the plot to the execution.

1904633307|4.0|I wanted to read this story because this is Jane Austen's take on a Gothic novel as well as her poking fun at novels of her day.  I can see all these elements in Northanger Abby.  Catherine's daydreams and suspicions of the old house, Austen talking to the reader in a humorous vein and the overall silliness of some of the characters.      I have to admit I had a difficult time keeping all the characters straight and it took me a while before I didn't have to refer back to previous pages.   This may have had something to do with the fact that I put the book down frequently.  It's not that I got bored, because I didn't and when I picked it up again I enjoyed reading it.  It just wasn't a \\"I couldn't put it down\\" novel.    I like many of the characters and I feel they are the strongest element of the book.  Catherine makes me laugh.  She sort of reminds me of myself because she can be so oblivious.  I felt her frustration and unhappiness as Isabella and John scheme to monopolize her and put her in a mortifying situation.  I felt her disappointment at exploring the mysterious Northanger Abbey only to discover...nothing.  I remember doing the same thing in my grandmother's old house.  I hoped to find treasures, but only discovered old clothes that smelled like mothballs and cigar boxes full of pencils. Catherine's love interest, Henry, acts as mentor and teacher and tries to keep her feet on the ground, but he also indulges her whimsical imaginations. This aspect reminds me of Emma and Mr. Knightley.  I feel Isabella and John are the most interesting.  They are so self absorbed and manipulative that it is almost comical.  What is more humorous is Catherine's slow and reluctant recognition of this.  Someone said to me that they felt there is nothing extraordinary about Catherine, but this is precisely why I like her as the protagonist.  Sure, I like to read about interesting, exciting people, but honestly, most of us are pretty ordinary and aren't we the protagonists inour own life story?      Several times Austen speaks directly to the reader as if she is telling a bed time story.  I read Pride and Prejudice so long ago, I can't remember if she did the same thing or if she does this in her other novels, but I find it a bit jarring and I'm not sure I like it.      Northanger Abbey was published after Jane Austen's death and I wonder if she had lived to go back and re-work this novel what changes she may have made.  Perhaps she would have shown us what happened at the end instead of paraphrasing or included the details of Eleanor and her husband.  Maybe we would have seen more drama between Captain Tilney, Isabella and James or even Henry at odds with his father or friction between Henry and John.    There are many things that are pointed out in Northanger Abbey that are just hinted at or taken for granted in her other novels, such as appropriate behavior, social norms and the subject of money.  Although in my opinion, this is not a perfect novel, I enjoyed reading it.  If you are a Jane Austen fan and have not read Northanger Abbey, it is a fun frolic through her world.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|This was my least favorite of the series and I actually had a hard time getting through it. With earlier books I couldn't put them down but this time, the magic and excitement were gone. Martin seems to write entire chapters with little interesting events, then just when things heat up, the chapter will end on a cliffhanger. The true disappointment comes later when that part of the story is picked up again after the resolution of what would have been interesting. You get the feeling that George Martin can't write the best parts of the story so he just skips over them and focuses on the droll aspects that don't go anywhere. Lastly it seems he's turning up the trash factor with more implied lewd sex acts which greatly detract from the book as a whole.
B005DWBIDI|5.0|I love this series. Gabriel Macht is today's generation Cary Grant. I love it when his character outsmarts bad people and Louis Litt.
B000FA675C|5.0|Absolutely loved this novel, full of twists and turns and amazing facts. Great novel, I've read everything by Dan Brown and this is one of my favorites, second only perhaps to Digital Fortress, in my opinion. Love it, keep up the good work Mr. Brown! Download & read this when you get the chance, it's one of the great novels of our time.
B0044RFT8S|5.0|We've watched both the DVD and the Blu-Ray discs (over & over & over again, haha), they work great (we bought used). I like that there are no real 'scary' parts to it. She is only 2 1/2, so there are some movies that when the villain shows up she yells 'Scared!' and makes darn sure I am in the room with her for those 'scary' parts. but I don't worry about this movie giving her any nightmares, etc. She loves this movie, & mommy & daddy laugh all the way through it too.

I AM TYPING IN ALL CAPS BECAUSE THEY RUINED THE BEST SCENE  IN THIS CLASSIC FILM (WHEN THE WARRIORS FIRST SEE THE BASEBALL  FURIES).  OMG THEY INSERTED COMIC BOOK PAGES AND ACTUAL BUBBLE  TEXTS!!!  SOME PARTS IF NOT ALL THEY USE THE DEFAULT COMIC SANS  TEXT WHICH IS SO PLAYED OUT.  I HATE YOU FOR MAKING THIS DIRECTOR'S  CUT...PLEASE SET FIRE TO THIS DVD IF YOU BOUGHT IT BY MISTAKE.   PLEASE BUY THE ORIGINAL CUT.    Thank you. :)

B004SUDPXW|5.0|This show just keeps at it. There's never an episode that feels like filler or a throwaway. And to top it off, this season contains at least two of the best endings this show, which prides itself on great endings, has ever provided. This is a must watch show for not just those who like great television but for all those who enjoy great storytelling, acting and directing.
1591843790|1.0|This book is not worth the time and I find it shocking there are so many 5 star reviews for this book. Mr. Kawasaki must know the power of good ratings on this site. There is not one original thought--the author says he \\"read dozens of books\\" to study this subject and was obviously just trying to regurgitate what he read elsewhere. The book is big on bullet points and short on content.<br /><br />I can save you a few hours:<br /><br />  You accomplish more if you are enchanting.<br />  There are many different ways to be enchanting, such as smiling, being humorous, dressing appropriately, and have a good handshake. Yes, he does actually does have a few pages dedicated handshakes. If you don't know how to shake a hand like a professional, you probably can't read either.<br /><br />That sums up the book. You will not learn anything. Two books to help you become enchanting \\"The Definitive Book of Body Language\\" and \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\". Those are two much better books.

Kudos to Jaycee for being able to relive those horrible years to share her story with us.

They are as good as the positive reviews reported.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|I have been in love with this story ever since I was a young girl.  I have watched the silent film rendition, and the Claude Rains rendition.  I have listened to the Broadway production with Michael Crawford.  But this work of art with Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler just moves your soul.  I found out that the singing was done by the actors themselves.  The music and the incredible acting was so real and showed the real emotion of the characters.  Fabulous movie!
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Being an Indie writer and eBook publisher I found this book factual, informative and his suggestions on target.<br />Some of his points resonate with things I have just begun to do, and so it is exciting to think I can increase my sales.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my \\"target\\" audience is far different, and smaller, than Mr. Locke's.  That said, the principles appear consistent across most genres.<br /><br />If you are one of the \\"700,000\\" self published authors, as he notes, then this book is worth your time.<br />Now, go calculate 700,000 x (4.99 x .70) and you get an idea of how much money Mr. Locke might make if his entire audience bought the book :)
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I honestly never feel a need to write a review for books I read, but this book was AMAZING! The story was great and the raw emotions from the characters made me feel I was living through them. I laughed, I cried and I found myself holding my breath in anticipation. For me, the author ranks with my favorites and I look forward to reading what else she has out there.
B0055PMUSU|5.0|It was really inspiring. The movie really teaches me that anyone can do anything no matter what happens. It also teaches me the value of never giving up and going for your dreams. Bethany Hamilton is the most courageous, brave, and strongest person I have ever seen and she inspires us all. So if you all are searching for a movie that is inspiring,and teaches us a lesson then Soul Surfer is it. This movie teaches us all a lesson the we should and probably will never forget. :-)

B00004RF83|4.0|When I recently viewed this film, I began with assumptions regarding the period it was made which was the height of the Cold War.  Having seen \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\" with its obvious take on the McCarthy period, and other films like \\"Failsafe\\" with's its playing on the fear of nuclear war, I thought this film would also have direct allusions to the political and social culture of the time. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this was not the case.  The first difference was the way General James Mattoon Scott was portrayed by Rod Serling in the script and powerfully played by Burt Lancaster.  In the Cold War period, the public's views of Generals was heavily influenced by swaggering, egotistical models like General George S Patton and General Douglas MacArthur. Considering that MacArthur was insubordinate and later sacked by President Truman, I thought he might be a model for General Scott, but that was most definitely not the case.  Burt Lancaster's cool, understated performance, even when he is in his final confrontation with the President shows a type of man who would NOT be considered  by outside observers as a threat to democracy the way Patton and MacArthur were by at least some people (Note how William Manchester's biography of MacArthur is entitled \\"American Caesar\\").  General Scott is not a rabble rouser and does not come across as a demagogue nor as a warmonger, as some Generals of the period were viewed, for example Air Force General Curtis Lemay. His opposition to the President's disarmament treaty is reasonable and he does not appear to be a Napoleon-type potential dictator, but as a patriotic, concerned public servant.  In the public speech he gives he does not denounce democracy and doesn't imply that maybe a different regime is desirable.  Having taken all this into consideration, I think Rod Serling was trying to say that a true threat to democracy can come not only from shrieking demagogues, but from people who seem reasonable and who might sweeten the temptation by saying the coup \\"is only for a limited time\\" or some such thing.  The second surprise was the way the President was portrayed. By the 1960's the US had seen decades of colorful and charismatic Presidents.  FDR was viewed as a father figure by millions of Americans, Truman, after a hestitant start was seen as a very earthy, interesting figure, Ike was a war hero and JFK was worshipped by many people. In this film, President Jordan Lyman is colorless, unimpressive, tired old man. In spite of this, the President marshals up all his intelligence and inner strength to take on a popular General when he himself is very unpopular.  I feel that Rod Serling here is trying to point out that true leadership can come from people who don't at first glance really seem to have the qualities necessary.  Another interesting aspect of the film is that it leaves a lot of loose ends....for example do the treasonous Generals get away with their crimes?  What is the public reaction to this seeming purge of the military high command for what seems to be a matter of nothing more than a political vendetta by the President? (Truman got away with his sacking of MacArthur who was not able to leverage his popularity into political power).  How do the Soviets react to this seeming lashing out by a weak President in what seems a desperation move?  Finally, I think there is an encouraging sub-message from the film, and that is that it seems unlikely that any such sort of thing could really happen.  We that that no only Col. Jiggs Casey is alarmed by the hints of things he was seeing, but also the Air Force General in charge of air transport contacts the President when he sees a lot of his aircraft vanishing from his control.   It appears that in real life, such a plot could not be kept secret and enough people within the military would oppose it to prevent it from ever being carried out.
B0043XUXS4|2.0|For some reason I just never bonded with the music. Intruder, No Self Control, Games Without Fronteirs (though I know of a remix that I liked better) and Biko are fairly 'good' songs. I bought the next one, Melt, and was likewise disappointed. I got the next one, 4, anyway and LOVE it. At this point I'd already been listening to Up, Us, So, 1/Car/Self-titled, Passion - love every one of those albums.     So for some context as to my approach to Peter Gabriel's musical career:  I happened to be curious as to what other folks though of this album because I was just not getting into it. I came into Peter Gabriel fan-dom fairly late. I liked \\"in your eyes\\" as a little kid and thought \\"that one guy holding up the boombox is probably soooo cool.\\" (I was 9 when Say Anything came out and didn't even see it until college. That impression was based solely on the preview, :) So I started purchasing and listening to his music in the early 2000s, totally out of order and I like it that way. It's different from artists who I've been following and experiencing in sequence, anticipating the new music, admittedly having expectation-based curiosity as to what new things the artist is using... But with music I started to appreciate even a little bit as a child have the advantage of being able to be appreciated without comprehending the context of reviews, popularity and the like.

B003D0ZNWY|5.0|I purchased this for my own collection because it is such an exceptional value and because the quality of the performances is very high.<br /><br />I accept that those who are very experienced and knowledgeable of Mahler's music may find some fault with certain selections in this box set, but really, how can you go wrong when 16 CDs, with high quality artists and performances, are offered for just a couple dollars per disc?? Surely this is something, whether you are a Mahler fan or simply want to explore his music, that you can't hardly pass up - I could not, and I have enough other Mahler recordings that I am certainly in no dire need of more.<br /><br />Other reviewers have very kindly detailed the artists who are represented on these discs, and most of those reviews have also been very complimentary. Going beyond Amazon, my survey of other reviews accessible on-line also found very positive comments - MusicWeb/Simon Thompson rate this collection above the DG set (see link below), and comments on classical music forums are positive. In this collection, to take one illustration, you will find all of Mahler's symphonies, with a selection of world-class conductors: Giulini (1), Klemperer (2), Rattle (3, 7, 10), Horenstein (4), Tennstedt (5, 8), Barbirolli (6, 9), and the price for this complete set is comparable to other box's for the ten symphonies on their own!<br /><br />This box includes the 1968 performance of Mahler's 12 songs Leider aus 'Des Knaben Wunderhorn' ('The Young Lad's Magic Horn'), with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and George Szell conducting the London Symphony Orchestra, generally considered to be one of the finest available.<br /><br />Most of the performances are from EMI's archives and go back as far as 1949 (Kindertotenlieder, Kathleen Ferrier, contralto, Vienna Philharmonic, conducted by Bruno Walter). Also included are three songs that have been newly recorded for this release by Ian Bostridge and Antonio Pappano (Im Lenz, Winterlied, and Maitanz im Grunen, at the beginning of CD 4), in order to achieve \\"completeness\\".<br /><br />My conclusion - that if judged only based upon the quality of the performances, this set would still merit at least 4 stars out of 5. It is the value that this set represents, that pushes it to 5 full stars easily.<br /><br />The packaging is similar to what is normally done for a compilation set such as this one. The box is a heavy cardboard container which opens up to provide full access to the CD's. Each CD is in an individual cardboard sleeve. Each disc sleeve is labeled with the track contents and timing. The 35 page booklet included with the set does provide details for the tracks on each CD, with performers as well as recording details (date recorded, venue, etc). The booklet also includes a modest essay \\"A century of Mahler\\" written by David Gutman. The packaging and booklet are completely satisfactory for my needs, and the whole thing takes up a minimum amount of room compared to the original \\"jewel box\\" plastic holders that CD's were originally packaged in. Frankly I prefer such packaging as it is much more efficient and still provides very adequate protection to the CD's.<br /><br />Also included as a .pdf file on CD #16, is the complete text of all sung works, a 43 page document, in English, German and French. (This is provided on a separate partition on the CD, so Mac users may not immediately find this when displaying the disc contents in the Finder window. And thanks to one of the other reviewers who pointed this out - I had not noticed it when initially going through the discs, and it is only very obscurely mentioned in the booklet and on the back of the box, and could be very easily missed).<br /><br />That the large record companies are now offering these large and high-quality collections of music, for a small fraction of what they would have cost to purchase (as separate CD's of course) just a few years ago - this is a good thing! I don'tsee this going on forever!<br /><br />For me, this is a lifetime purchase as well as one to pass down to future generations. In the coming years I will enjoy comparing these performances with others in my collection (symphonies by Kubelik and Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, for one: [[ASIN:B00004SA86 Mahler: 10 Symphonies]]). I am sure that some of these performances will be, for me, great ones. And others, less great. Isn't that part of the enjoyment of exploring this music?<br /><br />I am not an advocate of purchasing large CD sets just because they are inexpensive. Some seem to me to be compilations of second-rate recordings and/or performances (or worse), and I would not want those in my collection regardless of the price. That is absolutely not the case here.<br /><br />I give this 5 stars because of the combination of value and performance, with value playing an equal part in the decision here. The Deutsche Grammophon box set ([[ASIN:B003BZC2RU Gustav Mahler: Complete Edition]]) is also tempting, but it is also over twice the price (at the time of writing this review).<br /><br />I think that this collection is an absolute winner, hands down.see this going on forever!<br /><br />For me, this is a lifetime purchase as well as one to pass down to future generations.

B004Y1USV2|4.0|I'll try be brief: I've loved YES since the 70's, so that puts me pretty much at the same age as these guys. That said, this CD is NOT fabulous and not a \\"kick-ass\\" effort on the scale of 90125, Talk, or The Ladder. What it IS however, is very well crafted music (as usual), and music that is surprisingly pleasant and easy to listen to. They have suppressed their considerable talents and produced a disc that reflects both those talents and their ages in a low-key way, which makes it a pretty amazing accomplishment if ya ask me. So those of you who are long time fans like me will not be disappointed: the songs are all quite nice. Trevor Horn's contributions are considerable, but don't expect a repeat of Drama. The new lead vocalist is NO Jon Anderson, but, well, nobody else is anyway, right?  So fans, get a copy of this disc and enjoy. These guys are not gonna be around forever and it is really nice to continue to enjoy new music from this band, 40(+) years into their careers. Uh, you guys ROCK!! Progressively, that is...
1935670913|1.0|Wow. The tone of this book makes me hate the author. It's like reading a transcript of a Billy Mays Oxyclean commercial. Not only is the advice obvious, 'Promote yourself on Twitter! But be careful! It's addicting!' it's definitely not worth the $10,000 he claims it is. The main thing I learned from this book is don't spend any money on anything this author has to say.
0679746323|3.0|While I learned a lot about Mao in this book I only learned the awful stuff, which is pretty awful.  I think the author had an axe to grind and was not balanced.   Because Mao is still admired by so many Chinese I wanted to learn why.   This book did not explain that part.  So now I have to find another biography to make up for the missing details in this one.  Frankly, Mao seems to have a lot of interesting ideas especially his love of contradictions which he wrote much about.   In a nutshell, after reading this book I felt like I did not know Mao.

It took me back to the days when I loved watching the Secret Garden.

0553801473|5.0|This is a very good book--after all, I'm giving it the maximum 5 stars--but I'll start with one of the negatives:  A Dance With Dragons is misnamed.  Certainly dragons do make an appearance, but for a 1000 page novel with \\"dragons\\" in the title, the impact of the fire-breathing critters is strangely muted.  In the past 5 years, we readers have had plenty of time to predict how this \\"dance\\" would unfold, and true to form George R. R. Martin again confounds expectations.  The POV storylines that I had been the most anticipating instead took a backseat to unexpected, but nevertheless exciting, plot threads.<br /><br />Perhaps another title with the requisite alliteration would be better suited to the themes and tone of the fifth novel in the series.  Allow me to suggest A Plague of Prophecy.  Disease and prophecy both play major roles throughout the various plot threads.  Prophecies have always played a part in A Song of Ice and Fire, but never before have they taken such a clearly predominant role within the characters' minds and motivations.  The various prophecies have become a web of interpretations...and misinterpretations.  Additionally, pestilence is another consistent motif--the bloody flux and the twin forms of greyscale both becoming major plot points.<br /><br />A Feast For Crows, the previous novel, is generally considered to be the weakest in the series, and I agree.  Dance is a giant step in the right direction.  Once again, Martin proves he can surprise and delight his readers.  Yet structurally Dance remains tied to Feast:  they are each half of the same story, existing within the same time frame.  And while it is true that Dance's chronology extends somewhat beyond that of Feast, do not expect resolution for the story arcs of the earlier novel.  Both Feast and Dance are, in large part, set up novels for the big events to come later.  Yet while Feast at times tasted stale, Dance remains provocative throughout.  We are likely in for another long wait until The Winds of Winter, but there is plenty of new material covered to speculate on in the meantime:  false kings and princesses, wargs and skinchangers, giants and little birds...and, yes, even some dragons, too.

0553801473|2.0|Does this man truly have an editor? I feel it's telling that the very first page contains what looks to be a glaring grammatical error.<br /><br />This is a book dedicated to everyone's favourite characters doing uninteresting things in excruciating detail -- eating, pissing, sailing, walking, being kidnapped -- but ultimately nothing of real consequence. GRRM's writing has devolved into a Dan Brown-like parody of itself where every chapter ends on a ridiculous cliffhanger. Every character is being \\"killed -- but not really!\\" or \\"actually killed -- but brought back to life!\\" with such alarming regularity that it has grown numbing, predictable and uninteresting.<br /><br />The first three books in the series were fantastic but A Feast for Crows put the noose around my neck and A Dance With Dragons kicked the chair out. I no longer believe in GRRM's ability to wrap this up in two more books, or to do so in an interesting or timely fashion. I'll read a Wikipedia synopsis when the series wraps up in the year 2064, but as far as giving this man any more of my money goes -- I'm out.

B003Q6D1YW|4.0|As is the case with most films that I view, I avoided learning too much beforehand in order to maximize the suspense level. I was aware that this one had garnered some favorable mention in the mainstream press, and so was dismayed when it opened with an off-putting series of cartoonish figures and a jumble of computer screens.  Fortunately, after a bit of time, the storyline picked up and actually turned out rather well.  Funny, sad and suspenseful, I was glued to the screen and pleasantly surprised at how things evolved.  Although this movie does provide us with a really unique viewing experience, it somehow crossed my mind that the whole thing might actually be a set up--something like a scam within a scam.  It's difficult to tell at this point, but worth seeing nonetheless.

I am aware of many people who would be interested in a PG-13 version.I had to put a rating even though I have not seen the movie.  I do not want to see the movie with the current language in it. I realize some people disagree, and that is fine, but would be nice to have available in both versions for people of differing feelings and opinions.

B0055G9L9U|5.0|Suspend disbelief and judgement and just enjoy this great movie written by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, Paul starts off at the San Diego Comic Con and goes on a spoof filled ride across UFO land. Irreverantly written, it is filled with nods to landmark scifi films of the past and glorifies convention geeks of all kinds. LOL! sums this film nicely.
B003Y5H542|1.0|It is movies like this that give a bad name to animated movies. I would not recommend this movie to any one since the movie story is bad and will satisfy neither adults nor children. If you want to waste either your money or your time by all means buy this movie.
B000002G87|4.0|Layla is another one of those must have albums for your collection if this is a genre of love for you.  It, like Live At The Fillmore is made up of wonderfully composed and performed music.  On this album however there is an added pleasure and that is Duane Allman on guitar.  There is a lot of the same songs on this as is on Live AT The Fillmore but instead of being a live performance, Layla is a studio production and that is the only reason I gave this four out of five stars.
B003Y5H53S|2.0|Seeing the \\"promos\\" on TV of Rango, it appeared to be quite entertaining...cute & funny.  It was quite disappointing as it was not all that it was \\"hyped-up\\" to be.  Funny parts..animation good..purchased because of Johnny Depp and the animation.  A lot better 'animated' DVD's.
B000001E3V|5.0|This is truly timeless music, it is still being played, it is still listened to, it still captures new listeners.  The compositions are superb and the music is soundly performed.  Great music from England written and performed by four great musicians and three out of the four were from the United States, all except Eric Clapton.  If you are a lover of this genre or collector, this is a must to have in your collection.

034552554X|5.0|At a group home inhabitants age out, being rarely adopted and rarely able to go home.  Meredith Combs is the social worker and at age eighteen Victoria Jones is out and into a transitional home.  Victoria's date of birth and the identities of her natural parents are unknown.  The setting of the novel is San Francisco.  The social worker has been assigned to Victoria's case for a long time.  As the years passed, family after family gave Victoria back to the agency.  At the transitional home, Victoria violates the rules, pursuing her interest in flowers and neglecting to get a job, and is evicted.  While homeless, she flashes back to Elizabeth, a perspective adoptive parent, who told her about the language of flowers, a practice dating back to the Victorian era.  Subsequently Victoria is hired to work for a florist, Renata, one day a week.  With her pay the eighteen year old arranges for four nights of lodging.      The plot of the novel moves in two periods of time, separated by about ten years, a past with Elizabeth, and a present.  The two stories connect through Elizabeth's nephew, Grant.  The language of the flowers provides interest and descriptions of emotion.  The pace of the book, the writing, and the Victorian theme remind me of works by John Fowles and A.S. Byatt.  There is mystery.  This creates in the reader an expectation to be surprised.  The plot is better than serviceable and the setting, San Francisco, is outstanding.  The book is about genius and craft.  The book is romantic, beautiful.
B000274THQ|4.0|My daughter saw this in her German class and simply had to have it.  To encourage her German, I got it, not expecting much.  On her insistence, we watched it and I was very pleasantly surprized - here is a comedy, at turns political and personal, but always with an edge of realism and irony.  If you are interested in the personal side of reunification, this is also very good evocation and provides food for discussion, also very good for learning.<br /><br />The story is about a broken East German family:  the father went to the West and disappeared, leaving his wife and two children in the East.  The mother had a nervous breakdown, coming out of it gradually to become a leader.  During the upheaval 10 years later, she has a heart attack and falls into a coma, just when E Germany collapses.  When she wakes up, to avoid life-threatening trauma, they don't tell her about the reunification and go to increasingly absurd lengths to hide it from her.  A lot of this is funny, but after a while it becomes a terrible strain.  As life goes on, they work to resolve many issues, all the time struggling in the new society under development. It is interesting and well done on many levels, with great attention to detail, and always funny.  It is a masterpiece of political satire but real enough to be a drama as well.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.
0451191153|5.0|I borrowed this book from a friend who said I should read it before I read Atlas Shrugged, not because it was related to it but because it would make AS a better read.  This book is just amazing and inciteful in how it illustrates the difference between the Producers and the Moochers or as related in the book the Second Handers.  I highly recommend this book as it should be a required read for all college students.

1451629184|5.0|I thought Jaycee's story from her perspective was fascinating.  I have nothing but admiration for this strong young woman.  I would suggest, however, reading \\"Lost and Found\\" first.  Jaycee's story tells the things she knew and the things an 11 year old child thought.  \\"Lost and Found\\" gives more background and fills in some of the gaps that \\"A Stolen Life\\" leaves out.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Of course you have to read the saga in order in order to fully enjoy this book. But it is great- a little bit exhaustingly boring in the middle but part 3 is amazingly interesting!!! I loved it!!! can't wait till the movie comes out!
1597801585|2.0|The universe Bacigalupi creates is fascinating, and (unfortunately) believable, but I didn't think anything else worked.  None of the characters were likable, but they weren't anti-heroes either, just mildly annoying and a little dull.  Because there were so many, and we bounced from the point of view from one to the next, none were fully developed.  The plot was one of those \\"many independent threads all building up to a great calamity precipitated by a coincidence\\" stories, which are fine, but there were too many \\"why did no one know that?\\" moments that the action hinged around.  Don't get me started on the ghost.  Finally, thematically, nothing really develops either (are generippers bad? neutral? I don't know.  Was there a reason that character dies in that way?  no clue.)    A good universe only gets you so far without characters and story.  If you want all those things, go read some Philip K. Dick.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|A bit confusing at first bc it goes back and fourth from third person to first person point of view. but after two or four chapters u catch on. An excellent recalling of the holocaust mixed into a very interesting story. it def kept my attention from the beg. one girl i know actually did a bk report on it in 8th grade last year which is what encouraged me to read it. Teachers could recommend this bk to students while learning about the holocaust and students would get the feel of the emotions of holocaust victims. I did, as the writer vividly expressed the character in the third person point of view feelings as well as the scenes she observed around her.
B004YXE438|3.0|I like this game so far, but my big problem with it is that it takes forever to load. Every single time I open the game, it tells me that it may take a while because its apparently the first time I&apos;ve opened it. It has my game progress saved but it still thinks I haven&apos;t opened the app before?
B00280LYIC|5.0|Not only educational for me as a ninth grader about gods and goddesses but also has a great plot and very imaginative!
1416972242|5.0|I know I'm not a teen anymore but I freaking love these books! So well written. The characters have so much emotion and developed really well. I like that there is this world going on in our world. Clary is strong person, trying to figure out what happened to her mother. Simon is her good hearted best friend. And, of course, Jace is just a sexy character that everyone will be drooling over. The brother/sister dynamic is odd at first but will be explained in later books. That was the only thing I was kinda uneasy about. I feel like this will be the new Twilight-like obsession series, especially since they are casting for the movie. I can't wait!
0316098329|3.0|The story was ok, but I really found it tedious to read since the 5 year old is the narrator.  Often entire paragraphs are written in broken English and I had a difficult time getting through that.  I choose a novel because I want to relax and enjoy a good read, not because I want to plod through poor grammar.  As I stated before, the plot is entertaining and very thought provoking, but be forewarned that it may take some effort to get through the language.
0061714402|3.0|I picked up this book mainly because I saw Dave M. on TV talking about how he went from putting spells on people and the dark side to becoming Christian. I was fascinated. Then, when my son told me that Megadeth was his favorite band and he happened to have just read the book, that's all I needed and downloaded it onto my Kindle.   Well, I must say, that Dave M, has been a very angry person for most of his life. He really had difficulty getting over the fact that Metallica dumped him. Throughout the book reflects his bitter resentment toward Metallica. I can see how this would be tied in with the abandonment of his Father. Also, 90 percent of the book is only about all the drugs, the sex, and the rock and roll. I found it redundant, most of it and skimmed through most of the pages. Only near the end does the book finally get real for me. I believe his wife is the real hero here. To live with an addict and go through what must have been a living 'hell' for her and her children. I was so happy to read that she took some steps and had the bank accounts frozen and threw him out. Only then was Dave able to finally get sober and come to terms with his own demons. I applaud both of them for working together to maintain their marriage because most of these marriages do NOT make it. It takes REAL work. And I was so happy about Dave finally accepting God and turning his life around.    Imagine, how powerful and great he would have been with God on his side long ago, but for many addicts, who knows what will be the final bottom that they must reach for them to finally change. For Dave, it was losing his beautiful family.   An addict thinks like this: Me First, Me Next, YOU NEVER.   And to live with that........like I said, his wife is the real hero here!     One thing I did not like was his denegrating his band mates when he shared some not so nice 'habit's' of theirs. Some things are just meant to stay confidential. THEY know what they did and how they were. By sharing thesenot so nice characteristics, only breeds more resentment. I felt some of the book Dave was making himself the hero, the victim in most parts, and the best guitar player.      I am happy, however, that this story has a great ending and God will continue to be first in his life. Also, this illness of addiction runs in families and I do hope the parents educate their children.   And Dave, giving back is part of the healing. Please stop seeing yourself as a victim and think more along these lines: Great Adversity Builds Great Character! Because it does!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|For over a year I debated on starting this series knowing the time commitment it would take to get caught up to the current release. [[ASIN:B003YL4LYI A Dance with Dragons: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Five]] Game of Thrones is worthy of the hype as a compelling genre changing read.  It paces well with the differing point of view chapters, is surprising in it's subject matter and not as dark overall as been I'd been lead to believe.  This first book ends with a bit of hope for what seems to be the central \\"heroes\\" of the overall story, knowing that the remaining four installments may very well change that.  You find yourself concerned for characters on either side of the right and wrong coin making choices and reacting to situations that test both theirs and the reader's moral sensibilities.  A soap opera, yes; but convincingly mixed with enough political, historical and military realism to grab even this Tolkien diehard and 24's Jack Bauer fan. Ripping through the next one now...

0790749815|5.0|I was going to give this DVD a 4 star, but then considered what is offered for viewing now and decided it needed a 6.<br />The is a review of the single disc edition 0-7907-9993-6.  My copy played fine with no problems with audio or video.<br />The most outrageous scene, of course, involved the now famous crop duster.  How one could get a hold of an antique plane with a working machine gun is beyond me, but nothing, apparently, was impossible with the evil Red Menace. Don't get me wrong.  It was a great scene, except for the fakey crash. However, it would have been easier to have stepped from the cornfield with a 12 gauge Winchester 1897 and done the job expeditiously. The movie would have been shorter though.<br />If you do not know the plot, read Wikipedia.  The title was a puzzler, either from Shakespeare or Northwest Airlines, or, as suggested, nobody thought up a better title. The only thing that really bothered me was the old coot \\"making love\\" to a girl young enough to be his granddaughter.  Then, there is Hitchcock's final impudent scene.<br />This is a serviceable, inexpensive DVD.
B005BZQVF2|1.0|This movie is not for children or Church going people of any kind. It tries to make Darwinism as fact. It should be called \\"The 3 Atheist and a Alien on the run\\". Don't waste your money or your time on this one. And i know some butt head is going to react to what i have said. So go find yourself a Alien and write me and i am not talking about one from Mexico either.

B004WPT3ZM|3.0|there is very little improvement from the original or the recent remastering in 2004 as little cleaner and louder but not better-too much of these remasters are about money not the music.this cd deserved justic of the technology of todays digital production in stead the music is get muddied by over loudness and distortion and reverb messing the original purity and integrity of the sound.<br />then you have the live concert cd which should be amazing and the playing is great but the sound is lacking tone everywhere(i know live,1987,toxic dependentics of  megadeth)80's thrash/speed metal trainwreck on stage but they were also great musicans which kind of shows threw a bit but the sound of this cd is very thin and dated(I personally had better bootlegs from the 86-88 era of megadeth with this line up that sounded heavier than this)dave should have found an old bootleg like scott lan of Anthrax/SOD did and release it like they did, it would have sounded much better i'm sure.<br />all in all not realy worth the money,sadly!
1439102813|5.0|This is just a well written work. It grab me from the beginning and I was in the story the whole time I was reading it. Despite the subject matter, it is not as depressing as it might have been. There is a lot of warmth in this tale. It produced a lot of good discussion among our reading group. I think it would be a good one for families to read as a starting point for discussions on the important decisions that one must make when some one we love falls ill.
0316017930|4.0|I liked this book much more for its thorough fact based research compared to Tipping Point. I could not get myself to finish that one.    The 'good enough' of IQ and referring to the 'Termites' and factors that make Outliers not outliers are very thorough. Being a pilot myself, impressed by his grasp and research into the issues of cultural / communication behaviors that can cause airline disasters.    My biggest criticism of the book are my contrary experiences in two areas:    1. Practical Intelligence:     I disagree that it is the middle class and above that have superior practical intelligence because of how they are brought up and there experiences. People that lower than middle class from within US, and those that immigrate to the US, tend to have a much stronger survivalist instinct that leads them to have the nimbleness to spot and adjust to opportunities. It may or may not have been evident in the research he did of the technical entrepreneurs but it surfaces through the leaders of large organizations and non-technology entrepreneurs. A vast majority of Silicon Valley start-ups are by immigrants (non-US born) and they did not have the same middle class experiences in their country of birth that are comparable to those here that he talks about (like being taken to different sports events, taught different skills outside of school).     2. Rice Paddy Cultural/Work Ethic/Superior Math Scores:    The reason Americans have low math scores is because we stopped working hard as a country when it comes to academics. That is more because we have attained a level of prosperity where the high-school kids would rather be motivated to do other things. You can be 16 and hold a summer job and afford a car. Plus when you have the option of taking part in 3 varsity sports, why would you want to do study Calculus in an honor program. There is no incentive, desire, or propensity to work hard at studying math. Hard work is chanelled to other areas like sports. (note I am notsaying kids are lazy, just that the focus is elsewhere). Parents also don't consider focusing on math as an important imperative. Same goes for university: why do something analytical like engineering/accounting/physics, when you can study any other field and still get a middle class job with a decent lifestyle. In other countries (particularly the ones he talks about): no good academic and specifically math scores, and no upward mobility.     This has been the historical trend thats a result of US prosperity and not any genetic wiring of rice paddy work ethic (superior math scores) vs. mechanical means. Situation is changing now, and the trend is going to adjust and may even reverse. Engineers have the lowest unemployment and there continues to be a shortage of software engineers/architects, whereas there is an oversupply of Lawyers out of school.  In summary we have chosen (for the worse) to ignore the importance of Math period.    Lastly, most of the world's major innovations have all been as a result of work done in US / Europe in the last 100-150 years. You can go as far back as the light bulb, electric generator, telegraph, wireless signal, or as recently as GPS, airline travel, search technology.     For all the gusto that the press likes to lavish on emerging economies, they are best copying model where they are taking these innovations, and because of there educated but under utilized workforce are able to turn into a comparative advantage. I have seen zero new disruptive or new technology come out of these countries. So for all the math prowess he talks about, it has at best been use to replicate the model and incrementally improve vs. come out with new ways we do things that came out of industries in these countries.
0316056863|5.0|I have the audio version of the book and let me tell you, it was SO worth it.  She narrates it and adds an element that really brings it together.  I was laughing out loud, I missed my exit twice on the freeway, etc.   She is a phenomenal narrator and draws you in so well.  I could see that I may not have finished it as quickly if I were reading it, and just like 30 rock, I think many of her subtle humorous moments are lost without a careful read.  I highly rec. this book!

B0042JIL2E|5.0|IN A SNAPSHOT: Rockabilly/Swing, with a distictive bass sound, fused with jazz/Irish soul/surf music guitars and a distinctive unforgettable voice.Well paced mixture of rocking and slower paced songs. The second solo outing for Ms May, which offers the next step up from Love Tattoo in her musical development.All written (except Tainted Love)by her and she is backed by a tight and steaming combo with guests. She has stepped out of the Jeff Beck school of perfection to deliver a well produced and endearing tribute to a style that simply that does not get its just dues in modern music appreciation.Dynamite vocal dynamite sound dynamite production, instantly listenable and with feeling. 5 stars.<br /><br />I have recently listened to Love Tattoo again, and realized why I loved the Imelda May sound. Irish soul mixed with that United Kingdom blend of rockabilly and swing and a voice that makes it all come at you like a locomotive. She is pint sized but all class,sassy with power, having of recent times been mentored by Jeff Beck and showing all the benefits that he has brought to her sound and confidence with a song. I saw her live in Australai in 2010, when she supported Jeff Beck and was treated to achingly beutiful renditions of songs and knockout rock and rockabilly.I would recommend that you get the Rock n Roll Party (Tribute to Les Paul) by Jeff Beck and experience the seven or eight tracks on there that have Ms May singing vocals and flexing her not insubstantial vocal range and chords on some classic vintage tunes.Listen to Sitting on Top of the World and appreciate.<br /><br />For me to purchase  a CD these days, and one that borrows from a pioneering sound of the 1950's and 60s at that, there has to be something that grips you straight away, an excellence in tone and style, otherwise it falls flat and runs out of puff and leaves you dissatisfied  as it is simply a pale imitation of Wanda Jackson or who ever.From the opening sounds this CD delivers, and yes it is pitched to be radio and industry friendly, but then again the type of music makes it that way. You want to move and experience the obvious feeling that is being unleashed here and the tightness of the band compliments the vocal delivery.On that point, her version of Tainted Love is a knockout and rips along ,so much so that she has given the song a new lease of life.She is Irish for petes sake and she can sing and I would suspect has no problems in reconciling her devilish pursuit of a good song and time with her Catholic upbringing. I think everyone should go to an Irish Pub, in Ireland and experience a culture that loves to enjoy itself. I am unashamedly delighted with this CD, which these days can never be guaranteed, so I would recommend it to all if you want to experience a modern vocally enchanting delivery of the interpretation of the basics or rock n roll and bass swing. 5 stars.e radio and industry friendly, but then again the type of music makes it that way.

1423389387|2.0|Nick Podehl does a respectable job narrating this middle part of the Kingkiller Chronicles. His youthful voice fits 16-year old Kvothe perfectly.<br /><br />As for the story itself, I don't see much reason for the existent fans of the trilogy not to enjoy this installment. They probably already expect not to get any answers or a proper story arc in this book. Kvothe spends plenty of time acquiring more magical skills, playing music, learning tai-chi, having sex and traipsing around Rothfuss's imagined world, all while being your regular Gary Stu. None of this advances the overall story though.<br /><br />But hey, this is what many fantasy fans seem to enjoy. Library shelves dedicated to fantasy are filled with 1000-page long nerdy male wish fulfillment romps just like this one.

038572179X|1.0|I didn't care for this book much at all.  All the reviews said that it was slow getting into it, but worth it.  Not really.  It is my book for the letter \\"I\\" and I am very happy to move on to \\"J\\".  The basic plot of the book is about a 13 year old girl who has the wrong impression of her sister's relationship with a boy and accuses him of raping her cousin and gets him sent to prison.  Then her growing up and him getting out and the true story and them trying to make amends and what not.    Like I mentioned, very slow moving.  The author seemed to go off on tangents that had nothing to do with anything and went on forever!  I found myself jumping paragraphs like crazy because it was all blah blah blah to me.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|Very minor overall plot spoilers at the end bit, after asterisks.<br /><br />First, the second 1/3 moves pretty quick and got exciting in parts and overall I left feeling happy to be in that world, pleased with Martin's overall style but bored in some parts with slow pacing, and the more I think on it the more book 5 is a LOT like book 1.<br /><br />It all seems like a setup to something more, and the let down is that after book 4 I was already expecting 'something more' to happen. If I consider 4 & 5 together, as they should have been, then I have to give it 3 stars only because of the total writing diarrhea going on. I'm going to have to echo what other reviewers say over and over and claim I think it would have been better to combine the two and cut 60% of it out (or severly shorten parts). I truly think all we get from some characters (especially in book 4 and with Cersei in general) we could have gotten in synopsis from other characters, a technique Martin does employ in some areas and was doing more of early on - something movies do a lot to help with pacing.<br /><br />I bought this on my Kindle. Reading maps was totally useless, and in a book like this you need to be able to flip around to maps & appendixes often, so I really would NOT recommend Kindle version. I also ran into a LOT of spelling errors/typos and I'm not the best proof-reader, so clearly there were more than I found. Very strange.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Since this book, especially the last half, seriously reminds me of book 1, I am maybe overly hopefully that book 6 will be a lot like book 2 except with dragons and white walkers (i mean, really, how little CAN we see of these things?) instead of standard medieval battles - that would be rad.
0757302661|2.0|I am pregnant with my first child and got this book along with several others to prepare for natural childbirth.  I am not taking HypnoBirthing classes, which might be why I found this book to be lacking.  I do think that the CD that comes with the book is excellent for relaxation, so I'm happy I got the book just for that.  However, I don't think the concept of endeavoring to relax is really all that unique to this method, although I'm happy that the CD and book do offer some exercises to facilitate this.    My issues with the book are the following:    1.) I found this book to be very poorly edited (sometime it refers you to information using incorrect page numbers).    2.) Occasionally this book contradicts itself.  For example, it spends some time discussing how you should resist the urge to walk around because a study showed that there is no difference in ease of labor when you are \\"using gravity,\\" but she then recommends birthing positions based on their ability to help you use gravity.   3.) I also thought this book could have been cited much more thoroughly.  There is a bibliography, but there are many points when the author asserts something without providing a context for where the information comes from.  For example she asserts that the desire to actively push during labor is not instinctual or necessary and is just the result of a deep subconscious belief that pushing is necessary.  If that is true, then I'd like to know where she got that information...and it seems like it would be an easy enough thing to prove or disprove by simply comparing Western births to birthing in cultures not exposed to demands for pushing (Ina May Gaskin includes many cross-cultural studies in her books, and her books never question the legitimacy of the urge to push).  Instead of providing this type of evidence the author seems to imply that a desire to push indicates that a woman hasn't worked hard enough at the HypnoBirthing method and hasn't uprooted enough of her subconscious associations.  In fact, this line of reasoning (that a painful birth is the result of a woman's lack of preparation or unwillingness to completely relax) seems to pervade much of the book.     Personally, I found this whole book to be almost a knock off of the Bradley Method, although whereas the Bradley Method focuses on \\"deep relaxation\\" in the HypnoBirthing book it's assumed that all deep relaxation is a type of self-hypnosis.  This seems to me a different way to say the exact same thing.  However, in the Bradley Method there is a lot less blaming of the birthing woman if she is in pain.    As I said, I am happy for the CD, and I'm happy I read the book, but it does leave a lot to be desired.

B002RI9ZQ8|3.0|While I certainly enjoyed this book, I struggle to understand why so much praise has been heaped on it. It was interesting, but there was easily hundreds of pages that didn't further the story in any way, and then when we eventually get to the climax of the story, we are hit with a fourth act that wasn't needed in the slightest.<br /><br />Also, it shouldn't have been called 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' as Lisbeth Salander was more a secondary character to Mikael Blomkvist. It should have been called, 'The Guy Who Can Have Sex with Any Woman'.

My friend recommended this book to me and right away, I was taking great shots (compared to what I took with a point and shoot). The best part of this book is the humor and easy to read format. It's almost like a guide and I still open it up to review how to take certain shots. There is less technical jargon and more answers to the \\"why\\" and \\"how\\" questions that spring in your head. Overall, great buy!

1594202710|5.0|Dr. Kissinger has written a book that will be appealing to foreign policy experts and enthusiasts, those interested in China and decision makers who feel compelled to keep abreast of the big picture.      Through 40 years of direct experience with the country, Dr. Kissinger lays out important points about China.  1) It is a major power in the world economically and politically and will be #1 or #2 throughout the 21st century.  2) Chinese politicians are obsessed with internal order given its long and often violent history.  3) China is focused on Asia and securing its sphere of influence there.  4) There will be a co-evolution between China and the U.S. and the relationship will not be like the superpower rivalry between the old Soviet Union and the U.S.  5) China does not have a missionary zeal to spread its culture or values.  6)China is a singularity.  China is a unique civilization and describe it as a country is too narrow.  It has 3,000 years of written history and another 1,000 of oral traditions which makes it the oldest, major civilization still on the modern stage.  7) It has It is a nation of paradoxes by Western standards. a) China has the world's largest population and workforce, 1.3 billion inhabitants and 500+ million workers; yet, it workforce will peak in 2015 and rapidly start to age and decline because of the one-child policy.  b) It has some of the most modern cities and most backward villages with vast differences in economic development between the advanced coastal regions and under-developed western interior.  c) It is modernizing at an unprecedented rated which creates jarring tensions between the new and the old.      At times the description of diplomatic activities and details is fascinating or long-winded.  If you can work your way through some brief periods of tedium, Dr. Kissinger paints an expansive and detailed picture of Chinese national politics, foreign policy and the future opportunities and threats as the U.S. learns to interactwith China as an equal.

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This product arrived quick and was packaged well to protect it. Unlike most DVDs it arrived secure in its DVD case instead of the DVD being loose and flopping around.

I give it 5 stars and I think that everyone should give it a watch at least one time in their life.

B001MYIXAC|4.0|Let the Right One In is what happens when you mix vampires with Swedes.  The movie is a plodding meditation on coming-of-age for a boy in Sweden and the Swedish vibe soaks the entire film, right down to its color palate. This film is as much about Sweden as it is about vampires.<br /><br />Claudia in Interview with the Vampire brought about some uncomfortable questions about what happens when a child is turned into a bloodsucking beast. Let the Right One In answered that question: you get a 400-year-old bloodsucking child.<br /><br />Eli has her own ghoul, a scarred, plodding man who is not very good at bloodletting. His inept attempts force Eli to take increasingly drastic measures, until the whole town is on to her. But not before she befriends the little blonde moppet named Oskar (Kare Hedebrant).<br />Thing is, Oskar's kind of a freak.  Obsessed with stabbing the bullies who harass him, mouth breathing when he swims (seriously, he seems like he will nearly drown every time he gets in the water), and torn between his attractive but busy mother Yvonne (Karin Bergquist) and his fun but alcoholic father Erik (Henrik Dahl), Oskar doesn't really fit in anywhere.  Until he meets Eli (Lina Leandersson), and suddenly it's clear that they were meant for each other.<br /><br />Let the Right One In makes a point of keeping their relationship asexual. Eli's appearance varies from sickly to vibrant, depending on how much blood she can drink, which isn't very much. She resorts to ambushing the drunken, sad sack residents of the town, who take quite a long time to rally a defense.<br /><br />Let the Right On In uses special effects in surprisingly effective ways, with one exception: when cats, who can sense vampires, go on the offensive, they look like bad CGI. But there are other scenes that are pitch perfect and perfectly convey a vampire child in a stark white world.<br /><br />There's a distinct lack of police presence in this movie. The police are only heard as sirens, never in person. There's no sheriff to speak of. Part of why Eli gets away with as many murders as she does is because there's a plot-induced blindness by law enforcement and medical services.<br /><br />And yet Let the Right One In is an undeniably creepy vampire movie. It's in part related to the no holds barred conflict between bully and bullied, who increasingly up the stakes until...well, until a vampire has to get involved.  And that never ends well.<br /><br />American audiences are likely to find Let the Right One In dull and plodding, with occasional moments of brilliance.  I prefer to see it as a distinctly Swedish take on the bloody business of puberty..

B0053Q9DHW|5.0|Though there have been many versions of Charlotte Brontë's 1847 Victorian novel JANE EYRE the current incarnation as sensitively written for the screen by Moira Buffini and directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga at least for this viewer is the strongest thus far. Much of the flavor of this production is due to the spectacularly atmospheric production design by Will Hughes-Jones, the appropriately Victorian musical score by Dario Marianelli and the fine cinematography by Adriano Goldman.  And added to the responsible staff should be mentioned  the casting by Nina Gold who has assembled a mixture of famous actors with a supporting cast of excellent neophytes.<br /><br />The surprise member of the cast is Mia Wasikowska as the most fully realized Jane Eyre on film (and that is in the company of such greats as Charlotte Gainsbourg, Samantha Morton, Susannah York, Zelah Clarke, Sally Ann Howes to mention a few).  Wasikowska keeps Jane's focus clear throughout, never bending from her individuality nor her convictions.  She is completely believable in the role of a Governess to Ad&egrave;le (Romy Settbon Moore), a brave young outspoken lass to her evil Aunt (Sally Hawkins), a good friend to the housekeeper (Judi Dench), a responsible teacher for the missionary St John Rivers (Jamie Bell) and his sisters Diana (Holliday Grainger) and Mary (Tamzin Merchant), and most importantly she stands up to her own coming of womanhood  to the harsh Edward Fairfax Rochester (Michael Fassbender).  The story weaves back and forth and in this non-linear style we grasp the real essence of how Jane Eyre grows into the woman she becomes - despite a wretched childhood with her aunt, her misery n the boarding school, and her sense of being a poor girl who must be in service to the wealthy.  It all works very well, even the treatment of Rochester's mad wife who dwells in the upper room of the mansion and haunts those below until she comes to an end.  Though the story does not end happily, it provides a very satisfactory concept of life in the Victorian era.<br /><br />But sailing above everything is relative newcomer Mia Wasikowska in a powerful performance, equaled by her love interest Michael Fassbinder.  This is an exceptional film worthy of awards and wide attention.  August 11ory concept of life in the Victorian era.

0316098337|5.0|I just finished \\"Room,\\" and I feel so strongly about it that I don't know if I can put into words just how much it moved me.  I was gripped from the very first page, and during the climax--which, unusually, takes place only about a third of the way into the text--my husband found me sobbing and I cried, \\"I need to know that everything is going to be OK in this book!\\"  The rest of the story moves more slowly (thankfully) but is every bit as powerful.  I have not been this touched by a book in a very long time.  I had to read the last two pages three times before I could put it down.  Jack is a narrator for the ages, and I simply adore him; he has much the same spirit that I see in my own little boy.  Thank you, Emma Donoghue, for bringing him to us.
0451228375|5.0|Ken Follett may be getting tired of hearing how great he is - that's the price you pay for writing spectacular, epic novels.    \\"World Without End\\" serves as Follett's follow-up to his 1989 smash, \\"The Pillars of the Earth.\\"  In \\"Pillars,\\" Follett brought the reader back to the twelfth century as a magnificent cathedral is built in Kingsbridge, England.  The good people of Kingsbridge (as well as the not-so-good and the just-plain-villains) live their lives as engrossed in their squabbles and devotions as any people, yet happen to live during the great feud of Henry II and Thomas Beckett.  Follett's epic novel tracked these captivating \\"everyday\\" folks and their stories even as some of the Great Men of History walked beside them.    Most authors would not have dared to follow up a smash like \\"Pillars\\" except in an effort to cash in, but Follett took his time and created \\"World,\\" another magnificent story of Kingsbridge.  Now into the 14th century, Kingsbridge still has its cathedral but the cathedral fails to unify the Kingsbridgians, who are as riven by strife and love as they ever were.      In some ways, the tables have turned from \\"Pillars.\\"  In the first book, the undoubted heroes were the builders and the far-sighted prior - the villains included the entitled nobles.  In \\"World,\\" the priory is no longer run by men of vision, but by men of conservative peevishness, who instantly attack any progressive idea as heretical.  And there are plenty of progressive ideas.  Merthin, a local boy seemingly cursed to a carpenter's life (when he desperately wanted to be a squire), becomes a gifted architect, and his lovely Caris challenges the medical orthodoxy of the day and instead relies upon her powers of observation to heal the sick.  Such ideas put them at odds with the church, and they suffer greatly for it.    Follett creates another wonderful heroine in the rat-faced Gwenda, a poor girl cursed with an ugly face and a worse father but blessed with the purest of hearts and the strongest of devotions.  Gwenda's story involves as much peril as anything Follett has ever written, and in most books her story would dominate the tale, but here she merely serves as part of the overall tapestry.    All of the action takes place under the shadow of a sinister event four young children witness in the woods, as a knight kills two murderers and buries a mysterious, powerful secret after swearing them to secrecy.  This secret has the power to shake the foundations of England and is a constant threat to the peace of Kingsbridge.    All in all, another great epic novel - right up there with such classics as \\"Shogun\\" and Patrick O'Brian's \\"Master and Commander\\" series.  And with \\"Pillars.\\"
0061537969|5.0|I was skeptical of a book written about a family from the perspective from a dog, but I was wonderfully surprised. The story is compelling and captivating. I purchased it to take to the beach, but it was not what I would consider a beach read - while it can be light-hearted it is a deeply moving story that nearly brought me to tears. I have already recommended this book to several people.

B0057A6GA6|5.0|This is my favorite game for the Acer Iconia 500. It looks great, plays great and is well worth the money. Make sure you get the HD for a tablet. I tried the free versions and they do not look as good because they are not optimized for tablets. I am a causal gamer and this has given me hours of fun play. I had never played a tower defense game until I got my tablet and this is by far the best of the 10 or so I have tried. There are two major play lines (survival and campaign) and each of those is broken into three game levels (silver, gold and bonus). Each of those has four player skill levels (casual, normal etc.). Each of the game levels follows a storyline that has numerous missions. Each mission has 20 to 40+ waves of attacks. There are many different towers available and many types of zombies. Some missions only have a few towers available, some have more types of zombies, you have to change your strategy for every mission. I have already received one upgrade and I think it added more levels. This is not hard core gaming but it is perfect for a touch screen tablet. I highly recommend this game. But beware - it is kind of addictive :)

0061784788|5.0|My first thought after just finishing James Rollins' latest novel The Devil Colony is wow!  After I become been a fan of Steve Berry's Cotton Malone novels, Amazon recommended The Devil Colony to me based on my favorable ratings.  If you are a fan of Berry, you will love this.<br /><br />I won't try to repackage the plot from the product description, but I thought I'd tell you what I liked about The Devil Colony.  First it is action packed and fast paced.  I finished it in five days, and that is pretty quick for me with The Devil Colony coming in at almost 500 pages.  However in spite of the action it is also has an intellectual appeal as well.  If you read Berry's The Jefferson Key, you will appreciate Thomas Jefferson's historical role in the plot of The Devil Colony.  The Sigma Team faces a mystery in the present day that weaves together the founding of our country along with Mormon and Native American legends.  The balance of action and intellect really hit my sweet spot.  Unlike me many readers will already be familiar with a number of the protagonists since there have been a number of previous Sigma Force novels.  However I thought that Sigma faced a worthy antagonist in Rafael Saint Germaine.  I found him interesting as a French aristocrat who is extremely smart but suffers from a rare brittle bone disease.  Throughout the novel he is both ruthless yet shows twinges of conscience.  Rollins did a good job of making him formidable while still believable.  Finally, at different points characters on both sides experience real loss.  I find that this also adds to the credibility of the story rather than the false build of tension where everything is resolved in a best case scenario.<br /><br />I could say a lot more about The Devil Colony, but you are trying to answer the all important question, \\"Should I buy this book?\\"  If you like the type of novel I have described or you are a fan of Steve Berry who hasn't tried James Rollins yet, the answer is a resounding, emphatic yes!  I plan to work in more of Rollins' novels onto my reading list.<br /><br />Overall:  Aplan to work in more of Rollins' novels onto my reading list.    Overall:  A

0553801473|5.0|I loved this book. It was well written, and there was excitement, surprise, and mystery. I really wanted to savor it and make it last, but I read it rather quickly, and am about 1/4 way through a second read.<br /><br />I don't quite understand all of the negative reviews. This is a transition book. It parallels another transition book. The plot cannot advance beyond what the other book allows until the story lines catch up. Don't you think that if any MAJOR events happened in these POV chapters, the major characters in the other book would have heard about them? The action moves exactly as much as it should considering the timeline and what's happening elsewhere. We had three books before, we'll have at least two after, so there is plenty of time to run the plotlines back together. Relax. Enjoy the story.<br /><br />In a story this large, it can't be the pace of A Storm of Swords constantly. Plenty of very important things happened, and beyond that, the characters are primed to move the story forward rapidly as the threads all near one another. To me, the plot moved along just fine. The more story that there is, the more I get to enjoy. Sure, I want to know the secrets we've been waiting to know, and I'm also eager to see how this whole story plays out in the grand scheme of things. But I really like this story and just want to enjoy the journey. That's okay with me. May not be (and obviously isn't) for many people.<br /><br />I think that some people are just upset because they've spent years assuming they knew where the story was going, or guessing at where it was going, and then they realized that it's not their story. It's not wrapping up as quickly or neatly as they would have liked, in the way they wanted it to.<br /><br />This book is also bleak. And dark. Winter is cruel, and it's coming fast. Hard decisions have to be made. Many of them are choices between bad and worse, and you don't know which is which.<br /><br />New twists, misleading storylines (I have no doubt), and hard realities are woven throughout the prose, which continues to improve.<br /><br />I'm not telling you that you must like this book, I'm just saying that I liked it. My opinion is that it was great, and that many people who have disliked it might have had expectations unfulfilled, causing them to react negatively without regarding the story in light of what it really is, and on the merits it has on its own. I'm one of those who waited almost the entire 11 years for these plot arcs and characters to continue since ASOS. Believe me, I'm anxious for answers, too. But I still really enjoyed this part of the story.<br /><br />Short story: if you disliked A Feast For Crows, you'll probably be frustrated with this book. I like them both. A lot.
B004498KPU|4.0|First, I gave this set 4 stars based on the set and what was included. I will mention what I feel should have been added but that had no bearing on why it got just 4 stars. First off, put aside Michael's personal/legal issues, this is about the music/performances only. First I actually got to see videos that I have never seen before (I didn't have cable back in the day, so usually when I was at a friend's house I would watch mtv/vh1 (or should I say the john mellencamp channel as vh1 loved him..which isn't bad since I love his music as well) So anytime I get to see anything new is great for me. (new to me is still new) the performances/videos are as great as I remember them and the audio sounds great. However, there are times I feel like I'm watching an old video countdown show or looking at a vhs copy. The set says remastered (and formatted for widescreen televisions, though when played through my pc on cyberlink power dvd, I had a hard time making it appear as widescreen, but it worked find on my console) The intro clips etc looked excellent, and consider how popular Michael was you figured someone would have worked harder and keeping this stuff in more pristine condition, unless it was, and this isn't sourced from first generation film. To be honest, I have not seen many of these videos that much (except on the history on film collections) so I have no clue what was left out, if anything was. The Bad video etc seems to be the full version. (as I've seen more than one version of that one) and of course the stuff that was edited for tv (as they would show some videos in between saturday movies, if they had extra time to kill) seems to be unedited here.    the things I would have loved to see though, would have been Captain EO (which I have seen online before, and it's a bit cheesy but a good cheesy) and I would have liked to see the full version of the Moonwalker video (which had more involved scenes for Smooth Criminal) I know that they include a lot of the videosfrom that release, but I wanted them in a single cohesive package...it could have been a bonus on the dvd. I own the deluxe version of Thriller that Includes the Motown performance where he showcased his Moonwalking ability. and would have loved to see  that here just to have it in the same package. Also I own the Ultimate collection (I love those collections, I also have one with Billy Joel, and I love how they include rarer songs/b-sides/alternate takes/soundtrack songs..so I can have everything) and it included the live in bucharest (hopefully I spelled that right)and again, it would have been great to have it here as well. Basically I would have loved to have all the main performances included and not just short films. Just so that I can have one complete collection.     This set is better than the History on film volumes (two) as far as I'm concerned, but one of those was a flip dvd. meaning you had to flip it to see the rest of the videos. So anything is a step up from that lol. Also, one other thing, about the packaging. I am ok for the mostpart that this is a flip open case (though those are hard to maintain in my opinion) but it does have a slip cover to help with that. However, I wish that the slip cover had a spine to it. cause it keeps sliding off the dvds and book. A minor gripe. But, I have a huge collection of dvds, and cds, so I just wish that they would take time to look at this stuff to see how functional it is in the real world. There was a third disc to this set, which I think they could have added the missing stuff to, even in bonus footage/form. But it was great to see Say Say Say again, that video came out right when I was still totally amazed with Michael's music...and I loved the snake oil salesman theme, where in the end you kind of find out why they do it. Eighies videos were over the top or even cheesy but not in a bad way. Very creative though. and Michaelw was at the forefront.     One last note, the prison version of They don't care about us, is included, directed by spike lee, and well I think it detracts from the song. By showing civil unrest and man's inhumanity against man (though I am not sure if they were saying it was ok for them to beat up on white women because of how black people were treated, as I am often confused by spike lee's politics, he does more harm than good, and well I think music is one of the things where it can bring everyone together.) But you got to see all the violence (real) and it seems to diminish the song, because when you hear michael's issues it really doesn't resonate alongside everything else going on in the video (it makes him seem more self-centered, that the song is intended to be) But why did the censor the audio? I understood why he used those words, such as \\"jew me\\" as in context it's not racist at all, just graphically illustrating a point. But, I still prefer the orginal version of this vidoe. I like the inclusiveness of it, also the mix of the song sounds great. As for the booklet it's beautiful, but I wouldn't mind having it give you a little insight into the making of the video. But the pictures are great, some behind the scenes pics. Very nice, I just love reading info about my favorite songs/albums/videos. These are minor things though. I do like how they incorporate most of the videos released before and they do look better than they used to, but I don't know if I'd call them remastered. Most look pretty good though. They did remove some of the dust/dirt as it's called but not as much as they could have. But, Overall I'm quite pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend it.
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|Stake Land was recommended to me by someone who's opinion of movies doesn't always agree with mine, but this time we did. Bleak, vampires, apocalypse, plague, gore, religious fanatics, and hope are pretty much the keywords that best describe Stake Land. I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't just another vampire gore fest. It focused more on the human interactions following the fall of society than anything and how a small group of humans that have little in common can work to together. There were plenty of religious images throughout the film. The vampires could have used better makeup rather than makeup that harkened back to the first Evil Dead movie. As my review title states, It's not high art, but it was very entertaining.
1582701709|2.0|I read The Secret in its entirety. It was fairly boring, because it was so repetitive. It could have been summarized in 5-10 pages. But I guess a lot of self-help books are fairly repetitive. There were a few minor gems I picked up, and there were some major gems that I already knew about (re: we are all God).<br /><br />I still believe that, at least for now, our consciousness does not control many natural events. People cannot be blamed on an individual level, or even all that much on a collective level, for earthquakes, for example. In other words, you do not control everything that happens to you--if you did, what would be the point of life? You would learn nothing. In fact, one of the gurus in the book, Dr. John Hagelin, published a scientific experiment in which ~4,000 TM-Sidhi masters went to Washington DC to visualize a peaceful city. He calculated that the violent crime rate during the 8 week experiment fell by 28% or so. Others who looked at his data said he cooked the numbers, but even assuming he was honest, 28% ain't all that great, considering he had 4000 TM masters on the job. It could even be just chance at that level. Crime rates do fluctuate on their own.<br /><br />But the law of attraction is true to a great extent, as I said. Think positively, and you will tend to have (what you would deem) positive experiences, and vice versa--though this probably works much better in the first world than in the third world. But just look at what the book says to explain why we don't always get what we think about. It says that we indeed *have* already gotten everything we want, *in the future*, because time is an illusion. Ok, well, sure, time is an illusion, in a sense, but if we are to use the law of attraction as something real in our current lives which are ruled by the illusion of time, then we need to see results in the short-term.<br /><br />The other thing that really irked me about the book is the idea that we can all be rich (monetarily) if we simply believe that we already are. This is laughable just on the face of it. If everyone were a millionaire, then being a millionaire wouldn't mean you are rich. The definition of rich is relative, so you cannot be rich unless most people are poor in comparison. And then to mitigate that problem, the book recommends that in order to be rich, we must be big philanthropists. But it doesn't matter that we are philanthropists--unless we give it all away, we are still relatively rich, and that is the basis of capitalist empire, the idea that it's good to be rich.<br /><br />The idea that we can all live in $4 million mansions, as one of those gurus in the book said he does, is absolutely insane, and I cannot recommend anyone read the book due to this and the other problem I mentioned.<br /><br />There are gems in this book, that's for sure, but they can be obtained from other books which I'm already recommending people read (The Joy of Living, by Yongyey Mingyur Rinpoche, We Are God by Alexis Mohr, Real Love by Greg Baer), without the hyperbole and kowtowing to capitalism.dy are.

B0052UZIFA|4.0|This is one of the most fun and addicting tower defense type game I&apos;ve ever played. I love it!  The only reason I have to go with 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is a very large download AND all Popcap games seem to crash my poor little Epic 4G. I keep losing all my progress because my dumb phone can&apos;t seem to handle more than a level at a time. :-(
B0055B0MIO|4.0|Arriving like an invading army, Trivium's new heavy artillery In Waves has finally crested the breaking surf and forced a landing upon our littered shores.  Navigating past the wreckage of other lesser artists & albums, In Waves breaks through the lines, shatters the opposition, and emerges bloody but triumphant.  2011 is shaping up to be a pretty good year for metal fans, as we have new albums from Symphony X, Unearth, August Burns Red, In Flames, and Scar Symmetry, as well as several other notable acts.  And now we can add the latest offering from Trivium to that esteemed mix.  The explosive new album arrives on the scene like a summer blockbuster, assaulting the senses and forcefully demanding our attention.<br /><br />One of the first things you'll notice about this CD is that it's slightly leaner.  Most of the tracks are shorter this time around, with the longest one clocking in at about 5 and a half minutes.  They are also a bit more tightly structured and mechanic, which tends to take away a bit of the epic feeling.  But by no means is In Waves a bad album.  In fact, it is a freakin' awesome album.  I honestly didn't expect it to top Shogun, so I am in no way disappointed, and the album has been in nearly constant rotation since I picked it up.  There is a strong interplay between the heavier parts and the more melodic segments.  This was evident on Shogun, and is more pronounced here.  For myself, this is one of the things that draws me to Trivium as a band, and is part of their established sound.<br /><br />Tracks (on the special edition) that have earned medals of distinction are as follows; \\"In Waves\\" is the first official single, with a pretty cool video, whereas the song itself practically leaps out of the gate with Matt's screaming vocals and a thrash guitar intro, while the chorus borders on the beautiful.  Yes, it's a pretty straightforward track, but sometimes that is all you really need; \\"Inception of the End\\", which starts out on full assault, before switching to the melodic chorus; \\"Watch the World Burn\\", could have easily been the first single, as it also pretty straightforward metal, full of drum fills and more actual singing from Matt; \\"Black\\", with its great title and plodding intro, sounding very much like Trivium's take on garage metal; \\"Built To Fall\\", another march through melodic territory, with great leads and a sing-a-long chorus; \\"Caustic are the Ties That Bind\\", which starts out in typical Trivium fashion, brutal and catchy, but then slows down in the middle for some moments of beauty; \\"A Grey So Dark\\", which wastes no time hitting the catchy chorus, even if the track is rather short at 2:40; \\"Of All These Yesterdays\\", the sad \\"ballad\\" of the album, with some great lyrics and great vocals from Matt, \\"Shattering the Skies Above\\", which originally appeared on the digital only God of War III soundtrack, and is as vicious as the game it represents; and \\"Slave New World\\", another awesome title for a pretty awesome track, with guitars and drums that remind me a bit of old Danzig.<br /><br />Once again we have the choice of a standard edition and a special edition, and again, it's really not a choice at all.  The bonus tracks cover a wide range, with the short but sweet instrumental \\"Ensnare the Sun\\", which makes me wonder where they could have gone with using that as an actual track intro, to the already mentioned \\"A Grey So Dark\\", \\"Shattering the Skies Above\\" and \\"Slave New World\\".  Drop down the extra few bucks to pick up the extra songs, as they are all awesome.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that 3 years have passed since the stunning Shogun was released.  Like its namesake, that album was supreme and commanding from start to finish.  Does In Waves live up to that benchmark?  I have to say not quite, even though it is nothing if not a solid album from start to finish.  On the flipside, releasing Shogun 2.0 was obviously not the road that Trivium wanted to take, and it's a good thing they didn't.  There are certainly those fans who want the same sound pumped out album after album, but that is ultimately unrealistic.  In order to stay relevant, a band must innovate and evolve their sound.  Nobody should have to shoehorn their creativity to fit an expected mold.  It is good to have distinction between releases, and In Waves accomplishes this.

B004XJHBCE|5.0|This app is awesome. While it&apos;s nice that my phone has 7 home screens, all those apps get cluttered and confusing after a while.  I&apos;m only using two screens now, and I can access all my apps much faster by category now. This app has made my phone so much easier to navigate through!
B0055SWM08|2.0|Great game very relaxing to play such peaceful feel to it,  i cant for the squeal... When i found it i really thought that this lame but i enjoy it very much,  so i highly recommended this
B004UID2LC|5.0|This is such a nifty app. Download videos or just audio (read: free musc). I&apos;ve never had any trouble with it, and it&apos;s appeared to have many updates recently. I&apos;m on an Epic 4G, which gives me trouble often, but this app has always worked beautifully for me.  Love that it can be moved to SD card, because this is the type of app that will randomly disappear from the market, and I&apos;d hate to lose it.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I love this Zombie TV series...I saw it on A&E and new I had to have it. It's a little slow at first and kind of a Deja Vue in the begining of the program but kept my interest enough that I can't wait till season 2 to come out...
0743497465|3.0|I saw a lot of posts that were either extremely pro or against this book. However, it's not as bad as some make it out to be. While it does have the classic Dan Brown thrill and twist, I think it falls apart in the end.  Without giving much away, I think that the book's ending is either too predicable (though only if you're and avid Dan Brown fan already) or too twisted to be fully appreciated.  For me it was the former, so I was just slightly disappointed. In either case, if you're looking for something to pass the time while on a family vacation or between long flights, this book isn't too bad; though, you could probably do better.
B000Z45PEC|5.0|I tried to get it in Argentina but i couldn t , i m  in Austin for 2 months and the first thing that i did was buy the De Lorean, my dreams come true. The \\"toy\\" is perfect, you can see all the inside and outside details. I bought 2 cars the shipment was fast and the quality of the product is perfect.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I didn't watch Moonlight or Three Rivers, so I wasn't all the familiar with Alex when this show started, but I fell in love with him and the character Steve McGarrett.  I grew during the original show, which my mom watched and I have seen it reruns over the years.  While I do like the original, I enjoy this show so much more.  It is full of action, fun banter and good characters.  I think Scott Caan, Grace Park and Daniel Dae Kim are doing a great job in the show and all play well off each other.  Alex and Scott's chemistry is undeniable and I love the carguments.  I am looking forward to this DVD set and the seasons to come.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I have watched all but 4 episodes & the island fighting sequences are incredible - so far focused on Guadalcanal, Peleliu and Iwo Jima. The D-Day episode for Iwo Jima easily equals or surpasses the Normandy D-Day sequence in Private Ryan. It's an incredible work of art that puts you there & gives you that tunnel vision effect you feel under acute stress.    In fact watching the Guadalcanal night fight I was sitting in a totally darkened room & must have got disoriented because I actually felt, for brief seconds, that this was happening to me and the Japanese fire was heading at me. I also felt snatches of fear that I couldn't tell where they were or if they were flanking my position. So instead of just saying, \\"That is well done,\\" or \\"What a heck of a fight,\\" I was actually saying and feeling, \\"This is real & I'm in it!\\" Never had that feeling before watching a film - combat fear.    They based it on Leckie's A Helmet For My Pillow and Sledge's With The Old Breed and Tatum's Red Blood, Black Sand (all those people are central characters in the series).    I can't understand the negative reaction. I find it's better than Band Of Brothers - grittier, far more action, better cinematography, better CGG - but then I have always had a passion for the USMC island & jungle fighting. (To me it's like they fought a 4 year Vietnam). Maybe some didn't like the home front or \\"in New Zealand or Australia\\" sequences between the island fights but that's essentially what Uris did with Battle Cry & you can't just go from island fight to island fight. Those episodes are better than most anyways. I think, for whatever reason, some wanted an exact duplicate of BOB which I'm glad Hanks and Spielberg didn't do.    It would be incredible in Blu Ray. Ignore the nay sayers. This is a powerful and emotional saga of the fighting done by American soldiers in the south Pacific during world War 2. Do not make the mistake of passing it by.
B0055B0MIO|3.0|Picked up the special edition with the bonus DVD.  In fact, this is the first CD I've purchased in several years instead of downloading it online because I wanted to watch the documentary and the live tracks.  I'll post quick reviews of the CD and then the DVD extras.    The CD was pretty disappointing, mainly because it is so average. I'm not going to break down each track because I'm sure a bunch of other reviewers will do it better than I can but I'll just say that the sound is not what I expected.  Trivium have been one of my favorite bands since Ascendency.  Crusade was pretty good but didn't blow me away. Shogun is in my top 20 favorite metal albums of all time so I was pretty excited for this release.  All I can say is that they barely sound like Trivium any more and the excellent technical musicianship showcased on Shogun is hard to find on this one. Matts voice is pretty good for the most part, but there is WAY too much singing on this one.  Nick sounds fine on drums.  Paolo is hard to hear as usual.  Corey is much more restrained on this one and doesn't blow me away with his playing as he has in the past.  The album gets a 6.5/10 from me.    The extra DVD was pretty ridiculous.  The Live recordings sound good enough but the production is so super polished that it barely seems like a live set and that makes it less fun to listen to. Additionally all the cameras were a little much.     The In Waves music video was super boring. I think they were trying to achieve an end-of-the-world effect or something but it was REALLY slow and, for the love of god, why was Matt clenching his jaw throughout the whole thing?  It really looked ridiculous.  Like he was trying to imitate The Rock but his 90lb frame couldn't do it.     The documentary was nothing but a huge ego-stroke for this band.  The entire thing consists of the producers and studio team showering the band with compliments non-stop.  They are so over the top in their praise of Matt and Paolo that you would swear they were paid specifically to state how awesome they are.  Many comments about how these kids are \\"The best metal bass player/vocalist/guitar player etc... we've ever tracked\\".  Hmmm.... I guess you'd just have to watch it to know what I mean.  There is also a constant droning sound throughout the documentary that makes it annoying to listen to.  The doc is over produced like the rest of the media associated with this release.  Black and white and lots of brooding shots.  For some reason they interviewed Matt while he was driving his car (for effect maybe? Dunno).  The camera is constantly cutting here and there and never gives you any time to actually see these guys working.  In 40 minutes you'll learn nothing about the how they developed these tracks.  You never hear them screw up or laugh, enjoy themselves, cut up.  Nothing.  It's super slick and calculated. Nothing raw in here whatsoever.     Finally, I really like Matt Heafy but after listening to this album and watching all of the media content on the DVD it's obvious that Matt has a tight grip on the band and is a control freak when it comes to creating the \\"image\\" he sees for Trivium.  The rest of the band members clearly aren't excited about this forced \\"theme\\" for In Waves and come across as though they are just humoring Matt for the most part.      I've seen these guys live and still think they are a great band, one of my fans, but In Waves is average and probably won't get much playtime from me.
0439023521|5.0|This book is so captivating and rich in detail. The author didnt rush it at all and it shows. This book is about a dystopian society where 24 teenagers from each District is forced to enter the Hunger Games and fight to the death. It deals with society and moral issues and has a growing romance between Katniss Everdeen the heroine of the story and Peeta, a boy from her district that was reaped along with her and whom she will eventually have to kill. I recommend this book very highly, there's none other like it.

0545259088|3.0|It's taken me a while to really form my thoughts on this book, and still I can't really pinpoint exactly what it is that I want to express.  I've waited for it since readingLinger last year...and my love of Ms. Stiefvater's writing combined with the anticipation for the end of the series was enough to make me truly excited.  Unfortunately, though I loved both Shiver and Linger, Forever fell a little flat for me.  The prose, while usually gorgeous from this author, seemed forced.  The plot moved forward at such a quick pace that events appeared rushed and fairly artificial, though not so much that you couldn't get passed it and at least follow along without too much disbelief.  Sam seems to have gone from a strong individual to a mopey whiner and Grace's parents make a token appearance in a way that makes it seem like they were thrown in there just to make sure the reader knew they'd not dropped off the face of the earth. Despite all that, I did enjoy the book.  There are parts where the real flow is apparent and the beautiful writing that made me fall in love with the series tugs you in, so I definitely do not regret reading the book.<br /><br />I will say, though, that the ending left me completely stunned.  I truly don't even know what to say about it in a review that 1) won't be too spoilerish and 2) won't sound like I'm just fussing to fuss.  I didn't like it one bit and I feel like things were not wrapped up.  The end of a series should not be a semi-cliffhanger.<br /><br />For fans of the series, obviously you should read this book.  Don't expect everything to be tied up with a nice little bow, though.
1400052181|1.0|I was forced to read this book for school. Let me start out saying that I am in college so I have suffered through many required readings. NEVER in all of my life have a read a more useless book. I'm sorry but this is not literature in the slightest. The underlying themes break down, the story is pretty much told in the first few chapters, and honestly could it perpetuate stereotypes any more? This book was atrociously written with no thought to diction in the slightest. Her life was boring. The lives of her children may be more interesting but they contribute nothing to the overall nature of the book. It seems to start out as a biography of Henrietta but dithers on covering all sorts of subjects that seem rather extraneous. You read about something that may seem tangibly important but ten pages later it makes no mention of it and the book goes on without a second thought. THIS WAS AWFUL! Sorry but please its not a pleasure book and is in no way, shape or form enthralling.
015206057X|5.0|We originally checked this book out from the library, not knowing what it was.  It has since become one of our son's favorites.  It is very simple - the concept, the writing - but he LOVES all the different babies. He giggles every time we read it.
B000P6R5D4|5.0|Miss Potter is one of those rare movies that not only captures one's imagination, but tugs at the heartstrings as well. The movie explores the story of beloved children's author/illustrator, Beatrix Potter [Renee Zellweger] who finds her parents' lifestyle and social ambitions cloying and snobbish. She writes & illustrates stories for children as a way of escaping this rigid life. However, her efforts at getting published and taken seriously as an author face several stumbling blocks [this is after all England in the early 1900s] until she meets Norman Warner[ Ewan McGregor] and together they make history with the publication of The Tale of Peter Rabbit. Their romance is portrayed in such an understated manner yet effective in showing their genuine love and affection for one another. This movie reminded me of Finding Neverland [with Johnny Depp as J.M. Barrie] but not as dark and much more uplifting. Renee Zellweger is enchanting in her role as Miss Potter[except for the awful British accent], and Ewan McGregor is convincing in his role as her love interest.Emily Watson shines in her role as Norman's sister who develops a genuine friendship with Potter. The cinematography deserves special mention - the lush depictions of the English countryside and the serene beauty of the Lake District. All in all, it is an inspiring tale of perseverance, love, loss, and convictions that is sure to uplift one's spirit.
1451629184|5.0|I bought this book in advance of the release, and in my mind, I was doing what I could to help a little girl whose life had been cruely taken from her. I don't read books very often. And I really never intended to read this one for fear that I would be doing so out of mere curiosity. But after it arrived, I began telling myself, \\"What an injustice you would do to that little girl that wants to tell her story, not to take the time to know what she really endured and how she is coping and dealing with her life today.\\"    Embarrisingly to me, the little girl that I was imaging, is a very smart, amazingly intuitive young woman. I sincerely hope that she continues writing, whatever the subject, it will be a book that I will purchase.    I won't make this about me, but my father was a child molester, or at least he was to his children. I know that 4 out of 6 of us were anyway. And I know that life will be more of a challenge to someone exposed to this kind of adult behavior, but I feel so strongly that this young woman will be fine. Always a little fearful and protective, never certain who to trust, but fine all the same. She IS a survivor and she is sharp!    In closing, I want to add my wishes to the author for a happy, successful, and fulfilling life. You go girl!!!!
B002UXRH10|4.0|An artist's best work often derives from their personal experiences, providing an opportunity for them to channel their emotions into something constructive. It is unfortunate that the best albums tend to come out of a painful event. For Rihanna, the domestic violence incident brought about the creation of what is easily her best album to date, and one that she will be unlikely to ever top. Although she had toyed with darker styles on Good Girl Gone Bad, it wasn't until Rated R that this sound was fully explored.  The album thus appears to be a natural progression from its predecessor, while also giving Rihanna room to air her feelings. It remains unclear whether this album would have come about had the incident not occurred, as several of the tracks appear to address it directly. Some have also questioned the authenticity of the songs, instead suggesting that the album was a mere attempt to capitalize on the drama of her case. However, Rihanna appears as a co-writer, albeit listed last, on more songs here than on any of her previous albums. What remains clear, no matter how this album came about, is that it is a powerful batch of songs and Rihanna has never sounded better.    The intro \\"Mad House\\" immediately establishes the darker tone of the album, with gothic instrumentation and a man's voice, welcoming listeners to the madhouse. Rihanna's vocalizations over the rest of the short track show hints of improvement since her earlier albums. Her voice has clearly improved, and appropriately so for the confidence that the tracks here require. \\"Wait Your Turn\\" is one such track which has Rihanna showing the first signs of her tough girl persona. While Rihanna's never really seemed shy, this track brings her attitude to the forefront and again showcases the improvements to her vocals. The bridge in particular is strong. This is an excellent way to start the album, although it is far from the best it has to offer. \\"Hard\\" takes the bravado even further, again emphasizingan assertive vocal delivery. Some have criticized this track for being an act; however the performance here comes across as genuine. The song seems to be about nothing more than asserting Rihanna's confidence. This may not be the strongest lyrical concept, yet somehow it works.  The only real problem is Young Jeezy's rap, which is ultimately irrelevant as it neither helps nor hinders the track.     \\"Stupid In Love\\" is a personal favourite that tends to receive very mixed reviews from fans. This is the first track which could be addressing the Chris Brown incident, with Rihanna delivering one of the most vulnerable performances of her career. Fans tend to criticize the chorus for being weak or repetitive, however in the context of the song it fits well. The verses, on the other hand, are strong and seem very personal. As the first slower-paced track on the album, it is also the first true glimpse at just how much Rihanna's voice has improved. This is definitely an underrated gem. \\"Rockstar 101\\" unfortunately is one the weaker songs, which suffers from being placed between two of the best. In itself, it is not terrible but seems out of place with the rest of the album. The best explanation for its inclusion, aside from having a few more fun songs to balance out the emotional material, is that it contributes to Rihanna's confident, aggressive persona. \\"Russian Roulette\\" is again an underrated track that received very mixed responses as a lead single. This is easily the darkest song the album has to offer, but also the one which best showcases the improvements to Rihanna's voice. Many fans complained of the track being too depressing or too dark. This is by far the most passionate performance of Rihanna's career, making the song one of the strongest she's ever crafted (and also one of the best Ne-yo's ever written).     \\"Fire Bomb\\" is another album highlight, and a fan favourite. This is yet another track which showcases Rihanna's vocal improvements, with more flexibility and range than listeners have heard before. Unlike Rihanna's earlier material, this is a more rock-tinged track which again shows a little more versatility as an artist. Many fans fumed that this track was passed over as a single, only serving to demonstrate its popularity. \\"Rude Boy\\", on the other hand, was selected as a single and quickly became a hit.  Like \\"Rockstar\\", this seems to be another track to lighten the mood a little in an otherwise very dark album. For many, this track seems to be a favourite because it is more reminiscent of Rihanna's earlier material. Despite being overplayed, this is quite a strong song that suffers mostly from being out of place amongst the rest of the tracks here. \\"Photographs\\" is another track that fans favoured as a missed opportunity for a single. It is not really the most memorable track, despite it being quite a solid offering in its own right. It is a rather nostalgic song about reminiscing about a past relationship where there is now nothing left but the photographs. Will.i.am provides a rather mediocre rap, although his background vocals do suit the track.    \\"G4L\\" is another track that has been criticized for being insincere, as Rihanna calls herself a \\"gangster for life\\". Regardless, Rihanna's voice sounds quite good here although there is very little else of interest with the song. The bridge is a rare moment in the track which actually does something to break the monotony, and definitely serves to improve it. \\"Te Amo\\" is a Latin-tinged offering in which another woman is in love Rihanna, and is hurt when she is rejected. Rihanna gets credit here for tackling subject matter which is virtually unexplored in mainstream music. She captures the mood of the track brilliantly. Some have criticized the track as boring, however the convincing delivery keeps it from being truly dull. \\"Cold Case Love\\" is another track which seems to more directly address the Chris Brown incident, and does so in a stunning way. This is a lengthy track, which builds from very subdued, bare-bones production and steadily climbs toward a dramatic ending. Rihanna again sounds more vulnerable, which once more demonstrates the improvements to her voice. It may be slightly too long, but just when it begins to sound monotonous, the bridge kicks in recapturing interest immediately. Finally, \\"The Last Song\\" ends the album quite strongly, although it also appears to be one of the less memorable tracks judging by fan comments. At the end of such a dark album, this track feels like an appropriate climax, particularly the bridge, bringing the entire set to an excellent close.     Overall Mark: 4/5    An album this powerful will be difficult for Rihanna to top with any of her future offerings. Given all the emotion behind this album, it is fitting that it contains Rihanna's best vocal and lyrical deliveries. As a co-writer, Rihanna contributed more to this album than on any of her previous work. The improvements to her voice are evident throughout, beginning immediately with the intro. Her voice has lost much of its nasal quality and instead sounds clear and strong. Like most artists, she shines best on the tracks that are most personal to her, although her aggressive persona is quite convincing as well. Unfortunately, this album also seems likely to be misunderstood by her fans, as some will find it too dark and depressing. Popularity aside, this album contains much of Rihanna's best material from her entire career thus far, although it is unlikely she will ever go this route again. An album that derives out of a very painful, very personal situation tends to be one of a kind in an artist's career. For Rihanna, this album is a career highlight that may never be surpassed.
B0050PYNP8|1.0|The main storyline was good, and the movie would have been great... if they wouldn't have seen fit to add all the anti-religion junk in there.  It was very \\"in your face\\" about their no God (of any religion view) views.  Sadly, the movie would have been a great hit had they muted that junk.
B002N9MK8G|5.0|How many singers that are alive right now (on 8/10/11) will people be listening to 1,000 years from now on whatever medium is then in use? Aside from MAYBE Tony Bennett or Placido Domingo I can think of none, but if I change the criteria to \\"were alive within my lifetime\\" (since 4/17/47) then there are some names...Rosa Ponselle, of course, though she was officially retired by the time I arrived...Flagstad and Melchior were Wagnerian gold standards...Alfredo Kraus...maybe Pavarotti...probably Jeritza...sadly Callas whom I couldn't stand...Bing Crosby?...Ella...a few other possibles...and then there's...<br /><br />Frank Sinatra. His records aren't rare and anybody who wants to listen to him can. I can't say of him as I can of Kraus \\"he never hit a bad note\\", and indeed he hit one or two in this concert but nobody ever had greater musicianship or could present a song so perfectly. Combined with Count Basie...adjectives fail...this record could well define \\"great evening of great music\\".<br /><br />Is this my favorite Sinatra record? Beats me...there are many to choose from. But I do know I would not be without it. Readers may disagree with some of my inclusions or exclusions from the list of singers and that's OK, but one thousand years from now folks will still be listening to this album...that's the whole point of a gold standard.

B004ZH66XO|5.0|I really like this one.  It's really pretty simple but with just a hint of challenge.  Entertaining enough that I keep coming back to it when I have 15 minutes to kill.    A good game that runs well on my HTC Hero with CM7.
B0050LJIRK|5.0|I have a been a Limp Bizkit fan for a long time. Since I was in middle school. Now I am 25 years old and I still love Limp Bizkit and there new album. At first, listen to the whole album all the way through and thought that the CD was good but not amazing. I didn't think it was as good as their previous albums but I was wrong. After listening to it again and again, I loved it. In my opinion, this album is top 2 - top 3 best Limp Bizkit album. You have to give credit when credit is due. Fred Durst still can write catchy lyrics that are freaking good. Fred is awesome at what he does. I love all of the heavy pump up songs. Wes guitar riffs in the songs are really amazing. He is very talented at playing guitar. This band still got it. Buy this album, its definately worth it. To all of the haters, fook off and you can keep on hating because Limp Bizkit will always rise above and also did I mentioned they don't give a F**K.
116932701X|3.0|I think this book was Lawrence's attempt at equalizing classes, or perhaps taking the side of the working class. He tries to show that a woman of the upper class can be attracted to a man of the working class, and he probably means Clifford's paralysis to symbolize the paralysis of the ruling class. But I don't know what to make of Mellors, who didn't seem to love Constance in any way other than physically. And the ending wasn't satisfying: it seemed to just slip away. I've read this book twice: once in my teens, once maybe ten or fifteen years later. I often change my opinion of a book in a 15-year span, but in this case I didn't. This book is interesting, especially for its time, but not satisfying.
1451629184|5.0|This book is amazing.  I was so taken by Jaycee's strength, resilience, and courage.  I've read all I can get my hands on about this amazing girl.  You know when  you read it that it's truly what happened, not what someone thinks happened.  I was sickened by Phillip Garrido's selfishness and depravity.There is no excuse for his behavior.  Thank God, he didn't kill Jaycee. I appreciate the straight-forwardness and honesty of this book.

B000YDIA00|5.0|I have worn these boots everyday for about three weeks now and I have to say that they are the most comfortable boots I have ever worn.  I will definitely purchase another pair in the future and I would highly recommend them to a friend.  I only hope that Timberland does not drop them from their line.  The only problem with this boot is that they run a size too large.  After reading other reviews, I purchased a pair 1/2 size too large and found them to still be too large so I returned them for a refund and then purchased another pair.  The return and refund was easy and I did not have to wait too long for the funds to appear in my bank account.  I am very impressed with the boots and I am pleased with the transaction.
B003L77GGK|2.0|Supernatural originally caught my attention with new spins on classic creatures, original ideas, and surprisingly artistic approaches to every aspect. As the show went on and the plots came together, intensity grew and finished in a season five finale that closed up the five-season story arc in a satisfying way.    As a fan from the beginning, I was curious to see where the show could possibly go after an ending like that in season five, and was met with disappointment. I gave the show a fair shot, but I just wasn't as captivated by season six.    The story-lines were all over the place, the entire plot seeming to take a completely different direction by the end. Many things even seemed to contradict things we were told from the beginning. There was a lot of emphasis on the brothers' relationship that seemed to be there more for the fans than for the show itself.    My opinion will probably differ from the majority, but Supernatural is not what it used to be with this season. There are still some familiarities, what with the witty banter and the action, but it seems to be filled with little nods to the fans, which is a good thing, don't get me wrong, however they detract from the show and make even a sci-fi/fantasy show slightly unrealistic. Unexpected twists have turned into predictable endings. To some this show is better than ever, but to me it's fallen in quality, and can't really beat the original arc.
B0001I55SS|4.0|After reading some of the reviews here, I have to take a moment to remind everyone of what this was back in the day.  This movie had one big problem....it came out after Star Wars.  Had this movie come out prior to Star Wars, it may have been considered more of a success.  I had no problem with the story or the special effects in this movie.  Based on the time period, the effects were as good as they were going to get.  Those who complain that you can see the wires on the robots are sitting too close to the television and are spending way too much time trying to find something wrong with a good movie.  Bottom line is...this is a good movie that deserves to be viewed and appreciated.  Word has it that a remake is being considered and that may satisfy those who have a problem with this version.
B004498KPU|4.0|The way they put this together is just awesome. I love the 3 discs, including the bonus one with his brothers. All 3 discs are very good. The book...is fantastic! Very nice! I would recommend this to anyone. A nice collectble. But I watch it nearly everyday...

B0053HEZ3I|4.0|This could of been a really good steelbook but they had to go and cover the cover in oscar stuff and make the bottom very busy.  This is unusual for steelbooks and therefore the item does not really appear exactly like it is on this page.  If I could of rated it 3 and 3/4 I would of but I couldn't. Therefore be warned.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|The catchphrase is used in a scene where Portman and Barbara Hershey as her mother describe their food. I think it can be used to describe the whole movie too. The cinematography and the art direction is outstanding. The score by Clint Mansell is exceptional too.<br /><br />Portman is the center in this gripping and jaw-dropping tale about a troubled New York City ballerina. A very must see.
1451629184|3.0|This book was not as descriptive as I had expected.  Often times throughout the book I found much repetition.  I realize that telling this \\"horrific story\\" would be extremely difficult, however, I expected a bit more!  The book was written by Jaycee herself with only a fifth grade education.  Taking that into consideration, I think she did a wonderful job.  I guess I was surprised that as a \\"cleansing tool\\" she did not tell all.  God bless her for coming out of this ordeal with any form of normalcy.....but most of all for coming out of this \\"hell\\" at all!!!
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I love the variety of sounds available here...I have had several different sound machines (from white noise generators to fancy models with multiple sounds),  &amp; this performs with the best of them.  Sounds don&apos;t have easily apparent loops, and ability to mix 3 is a nice touch.  I hope sounds continue to be added to this 5-star app!\n
B001DTPZNY|3.0|This is the worst of the 4 films.   Harrison Ford is still great, but  he is starting to get to old to do this part.  They need to bring Sean Patrick Flannery in to do the next one.  After all, he has more time as Indy under his belt then even Harrison.  The only saving grace of this film is Karen Allen.  thank goodness they brought her back.
1594744769|5.0|This novel a lot of fun, and though there are some intense scenes, I think it is a terrific book for young adults.<br /><br />I read a review on this page and I want to repeat one of its statements right off the bat: you HAVE TO hold this book in your hands...when you do, you'll know why.  I truly don't know that a paperback could capture it, or even a Kindle: there is a, well, \\"peculiar\\" feeling to it, and it's captured not only in the text, but also in the dense, heavy stock pages, the crisp photography, the beautiful chapter dividers...they all combine for a literal and visual treat that lends the book exactly the right sense of authenticity of the setting of the story, like the crackles and pops of an old LP vinyl record.<br /><br />You see, so much is told in the visual context of the book.  These vintage photos of the peculiar children are vital to the feel of the book, as is the fact that they are all AUTHENTIC.  Every photo was collected by the author from, in his own words, \\"countless hours hunting through giant bins of unsorted snapshots at flea markets and antiques malls and yard sales to find a transcendent few...\\"  These photos are the backbone of the work, and it is in the manner and detailing of these images that Riggs has created this eerie work and made it come alive.<br /><br />Young Jacob Portman had a terrible day, you see, one that he described broke his world into two parts: before that day and after it.  In that one day he went from being a typical child to one who wrestled with terrible demons and fears and terrors that were indescribably evil, ones that lurked upon the periphery of his conscious mind and drove him inward and almost cost him his sanity.  It all happened on that day when his grandfather was mortally wounded, and as he lay dying in Jacob's arms he whispered a cryptic sentence that remained unclear until his father agreed to take him on a trip to Cairnholm Island in Wales, a trip that would not only change his life, but countless others as well.<br /><br />A couple of reviews have spoken of the tone of this book as something akin to the Lemony Snicket novels, but I disagree.  While there is a provincial tone in each, there is nothing wry or cute about \\"Miss Peregrine\\"; it is a tale that delves deeper into sadness and mental disorder, a tale of wonderful, magical beings haunted and hunted by horrible, vicious creatures that mean real harm.  I would think of it more along the lines of Edward Gorey or the Grimm fairy tales.  While Jacob's visit opens a new vista for him, one that helps him fit in with others like him, it also appears to have opened a portal through which his nightmares take form in the flesh as well, and while this creates in him a sense of place, it comes at a dreadful price, and rips the carpet of his old life from beneath his feet.<br /><br />And so I repeat my initial warning: while \\"Miss Peregrine\\" is a stirring story and delivers thrills and chills, it may also frighten the young and susceptible.  Readers should be forewarned.<br /><br />There is a brief clip of what I believe to be an early movie treatment of the tale (there is no definite indication that this is indeed the actual movie trailer), and this will certainly allow parents and children to determine the mood of the novel.  It IS spooky, and has some truly fear-provoking scenes.<br /><br />I am indeed looking forward to the movie, which I am told is coming out either in late 2012 or early 2013.  In addition, readers may appreciate knowing that while this book has a satisfying climax, it does not END.  There is more to come, and I for one am glad for that.l.

1451629184|5.0|The book was very detailed and wonderfully written.  I could not put it down until I finished it.  Easy reading and I loved the positive outlook of live that Jaycee carried throughout her entire ordeal. I'm impressed with her amazing courage!
1451629184|4.0|This book was amazingly well written for somebody that had such a limited education.  Jaycee took us right into her personal hell with her.  The story, while hard for most of us to read, is also a testament to the human spirit.  How she was able to maintain the positive attitude she has toward life after all that she went through is truly inspiring.  Very sad and frustrating story, but worth the read.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is totally worth $2.99. It is almost the exact same game and game-play as the Nintendo DS version that is about $20.<br /><br />So you are given various flowers and plants that you have to use as weapons to attack zombies. Unique idea that works really well. The graphics kinda remind me of like updated NES graphics which I love.<br /><br />The zombie and flower animations are really funny.<br /><br />I am 27 years old and I can play this for hours. You actually have to think and strategize.<br /><br />If you want something just quick and easy that takes no thought, then don't get this. If you want to see a zombie get eaten by a tulip, then buy this.
B004OZOTSQ|2.0|I like the idea and I&apos;m sure it&apos;ll work great once I figure it out, but the address won&apos;t open on my browser (chrome or ie) on my computer.   I was able to open it on my phone though...  Ideas??
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I'm going to make this brief. This is a good, solid release of all 6 films. The people who assembled this, used their good brains in the planning, marketing, producing of this edition are to be given RESPECT. They know they are doing! I'm anxiously looking forward to the release. I have total faith that it will be fantastic.
B003ODL43M|4.0|I love pretty much everything Blind Guardian does, but they are moving further and further into symphonic metal, with the orchestra and huge chorus thing. I prefer them in ye olde days, around Imaginations from the Other Side, and Nightfall on Middle Earth. Sure, they had all the symphonic elements, but they weren't the focus, and the songs still packed a wicked punch. BG is still good, but their songs seem a little more subdued these days, with more focus on being big and epic.
0061992860|5.0|This book is palm size, and is packed with survival info! It talks about edible plants, poisonous plants, how to find water, how to make shelters, what to put into a survival kit, on and on! It even talks about what kind of knives are good and not so good. Pretty much ANYTHING about how to survive is inside, and its a great pocket size book to carry.  Also the pages are made with glossy stuff, so this adds to the quality of the pages, making them not rip or tear easily.The print and the pictures are all in very bold and dark black, and the color pics are also easy to see. (not grainy like some small books ive seen.) If you wanna be able to survive and add lots of cool, useful, knowledge to your skill set, THEN GET THIS BOOK! I love this book!!

B001W6S0C6|4.0|I'll be the first to admit that Tim Burton's original \\"Batman\\" has never been my cup of tea. Even before Christian Bale emerged on the scene in the excellent \\"Batman Begins\\" I just never quite thrilled with the 1989 picture. For me, despite an excellent performance, the problem lay with Jack Nicholson's villain who was more comical clown that a truly sinister enemy of the people of Gotham. Burton's style also seemed conflicted over precisely what he was hoping to accomplish seemingly stuck between a cheesy 1980s action comedy and a dark and brooding social commentary.<br /><br />Still, for all its faults \\"Batman\\" is a seminal film of American cinema, for it ushered in a genre that had only seriously been tapped by the Superman franchise at that time - the Superhero movie. Modern audiences no doubt do not recall a time when the Superhero movie was a relative oddity. Today's summer blockbusters are swamped with them. Burton's movie then deserves our respect.<br /><br />I will not relate the plot here for I dare say most are familiar with it. But rather examine the 2-disc Blu-ray Digibook release. It is safe to say with the release of this high definition Blu-ray release that you can start using those low definition DVDs as coffee coasters, because once you have been wowed by these Blu-rays you will never want to suffer through subpar DVD transfers ever again.<br /><br />The video quality is a revelation, with a rich and colorful palette, more detail and a depth that has never been apparent on any previous release. The audio is also nicely done and far superior to anything DVD has ever provided.<br /><br />I would advise all fans of the movie to pick up the Digibook release. Housed in a book containing 50 pages of photographs, script excerpts, and comic art this Blu-ray release contains a bumper list of special features a 72 minute documentary, an enthusiastic Tim Burton commentary, and (most interesting for me) a 41 minute exploration of the history of Batman. The special features are: Legends of the Dark Knight: The History of Batman (SD, 41 minutes); Shadows of the Bat (SD, 72 minutes); Beyond Batman (SD, 51 minutes); The Heroes and the Villains (SD, 20 minutes); Storyboard Sequence (SD, 4 minutes); On the Set with Bob Kane (SD, 3 minutes); Music Videos (SD, 14 minutes); Theatrical Trailer (SD 2 minutes) and the aforementioned Burton commentary.<br /><br />With the significant improvement in quality and the housing of the discs in an attractive Digibook, only a fool or the technology challenged would ever settle for the DVD release. This Blu-ray release is definitely the way to go.cial features are: Legends of the Dark Knight: The History of Batman (SD, 41 minutes); Shadows of the Bat (SD, 72 minutes); Beyond Batman (SD, 51 minutes); The Heroes and the Villains (SD, 20 minutes); Storyboard Sequence (SD, 4 minutes); On the Set with Bob Kane (SD, 3 minutes); Music Videos (SD, 14 minutes); Theatrical Trailer (SD 2 minutes) and the aforementioned Burton commentary.<br /><br />With the significant improvement in quality and the housing of the discs in an attractive Digibook, only a fool or the technology challenged would ever settle for the DVD release.

B0041B4B8G|5.0|Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is arguably the best Will Ferrel movie ever released. I say arguably, because many people do argue me on this fact, using movies that do stand up to the Anchorman name as well as others that just should have never been released. But knowing all this, allow me to warn YOU THE BUYER, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS SPECIAL EDITION FROM AMAZON! In fact, do not purchase any super-duper-special-deluxe edition from any Amazon page without doing a bit of research and looking through other websites like Best Buy, FYE, Wal-Mart, Target, etc. Amazon's price for this movie is double that of Best Buy. Dont believe me? Go to BestBuy.com and find out for yourself. Best Buy's website offers the movie at 24.99. Amazon charges 49.99. Use your head, save a buck on a great movie.<br />-Atlas<br /><br />Update 01/2012<br />Best Buy and bestbuy.com have in fact sold out of the film. If you find a copy at your local Best Buy, grab it! As for FYE and other stores/websites carrying this product- Well, it's more of a luck of the draw type thing sing FYE takes in used merchandise and Wal-mart..... is Wal-Mart. Either way, for the savvy shopper who loves Will Ferrel and doesn't want to waste $75 on the Amazon copy or $40 (or more) on the individual sellers copies, keep looking. As cruel as that sounds. But there is something out there, it just hasn't been found yet.<br /><br />I had originally posted a website here that gave details of the movie for you, the consumer, to buy. Sad thing is, it was a dud. My mistake, and i apologise for the inconvenience it might have caused some people. I will continue to look for this movie at other websites and if I find a good SAFE site that offers the movie at less than what the lowest price Amazon offers, I will immediately post it. But for now, it is safe to assume that the movie has been discontinued for the time being. It may be brought back in the next year or so, but for now, it is as elusive as the Jackalope.
0689865384|1.0|I'm astounded by this book after hearing so many good reviews.    It started off okay if a little...young. I mean, uglyville, new pretty town is something you expect to hear on cbeebies, not YA.    However the book just went from bad to worse. I wish I could say it was stocked with cliches like Twilight but   it wasnt. It was just weirdly...empty. For a plot that could say so much most of the book was dedicated to hoverdrones. It's kinda baffling really.    The breaking point comes when Westerfield basically kills his own character. It FRIGHTENS me when I hear peopeople saying Tally is a good role model for young girls, especially when I hear teachers saying it. I never thought I'd say this but she's actually worse than Bella Swan.    Bella was an empty, blank slate, sociopathic character. Tally has a lot more personality to her but it is a HORRIBLE one. She betrays her one friend for a boy she's just met and then betrays him further on down the line. She knows its not right or fair but it's acceptable to her because she's in love with this boy...who she's known for a few days.    Yep, fans of this book may have you believing that Tally is a better role model, the plot is more mature and the writing better but dont be fooled. Its just more of the same thing.    Tally's former friend Shay is the only real role model in this book. Her motivation for turning against the system was a deep belief that it was wrong to be judged on looks.     Tally met a boy she liked and decided to give up everything she wanted for him. Seriously. Shay gets shafted and Tally gets rewarded.    It's twilight set in the future and nothing more.
030746363X|5.0|I pre-ordered this book back in December of 2010, and let me say that when I received it in the mail, I was STOKED! I started reading it right away. And of course, I only read the pages that interested me. You don't need to read this book straight on through to really take away from it. You simply only read the subjects that relate to the things you would like to fix on your body.<br /><br />I first tried the Low-Carb Diet for 30 days, and sure enough, I lost weight. But, I didn't just lose 20 pounds like the book promises, I lost 24 pounds! Yes, the Low-Carb diet works wonders and is the easiest diet I've ever tried. It's so nice knowing that you have a day off every week where you can eat anything you want. My days off usually consisted of ice cream and doughnuts. It was wonderful going through the week with cravings, and then saying to yourself, \\"Ehh, I'll eat that on Saturday.\\"<br /><br />Another section of the book I tried was the cold showers. I had no idea taking a 10-20 minute cold shower in the morning could significantly increase your weight lose. And it actually feels amazing too. I couldn't believe how effective they were. It also works wonders with waking you up in the morning. Something coffee could never do for me.<br /><br />When it comes down to it, I'm so glad I purchased [[ASIN:B003EI2EH2 The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman]]. It has enhanced my life (and my girlfriend's ; ]) in so many ways that it would be near impossible to type them all down.

B0002HYHSW|5.0|We bought this game for our kids last Christmas (2010).  They were 2 & 4 at the time.  It was a bit too hard for them to set up on their own, but the game is enough fun that my husband and I enjoy it as well.    Now that they are 3 & 5, my five year old can set it up on his own.      This is their favorite game and the first that they reach for.  It's challenging yet fun and the quality is great.  I would recommend this to a friend, especially if they need a game that is interesting for a large span of ages and doesn't take too long to play.
1932100660|5.0|I purchased my first copy of this book a couple of years ago - along with Eat to Live by Dr. Joel Fuhrman.  I read The China Study first and then Eat to Live.  These two books together changed my life.  Within two weeks of eating this way - no dairy - no meat - no processed foods - my blood pressure normalized.  I had been taking 4 pills a day for 7 years, and still could not get it to 120/80.  Within two weeks I had to start coming off the medications, and before a month had passed, I was off all four of them.  That right there was enough to turn me around forever and make me a believer.  Now after a couple of years, my glaucoma is gone.  GONE.  I realize this is anecdotal folks, but it is real.  I have purchased many copies of The China Study and given them to those I love.  I have influenced people in Australia, France, and Canada by either giving them this book, or telling them about it.  Their lives have also changed.  It is not difficult to eat this way.  Sure, the first two weeks were awful, but then I began to taste my food and I've never looked back.  I will never eat foods that will cause me to need those same medications.  So buy the book....change your life too!  Oh - and an added bonus is that your extra pounds will just slide right off - along with the benefits of good health!
B004UQPM4E|5.0|I am, without a doubt, a huge fan of Superman!  I grew up with Christopher Reeve as the Man of Steel and enjoyed his 4 big screen adventures.  It's great that these movies have made it to blu-ray in this great collectors set to enjoy over and over again.  I previously bought the 14 disc DVD set a few years ago so I've pretty much seen all the material but when I found out about this with even better visual and sound enhancement, I had to get it.  The inclusion of the deleted Return to Krypton scene was cool to see on Superman Returns (Even though I'm not a fan of that movie as a whole) but I wish they would've included other scenes that were in previews and clips from that movie.  I also enjoyed the addition of the Science of Superman special.  An interesting and scientific look into just how plausable and reality based Superman's powers and abilities would be.    All in all if you are a huge fan of Superman or you just enjoy these movies this is a must have!  These are movies that you can watch time and time again and they are always fun.
B004GGM444|5.0|I have no idea how I stumbled upon this artist but listening to a few bits of music from my 13 year old son I was intrigued by dubstep. After downloading this entire album I was completely blown away on how every song on this CD makes every nerve ending in my body convulse with joy. Truly a must for anyone that is just getting into dubstep but I believe long time dubstep listeners can really appreciate Skrillex.

0062060554|1.0|So I found this book on yahoo's must read list for the summer. I also read some of the reviews and most were decent. So I picked up the book and started to read.  First off the book is super slow to begin with. I was about to throw it down and not look at it again but I kept going hoping it would get better. It didn't. If nothing else it got even worse. Most people that reviewed the book and said the last couple chapters were the best are right. Most of the other 250-300 pages were a waste of my time to read. The ending also was not good. It left the story wide open and didn't resolve any of the conflicts that were presented in the book.   Overall I wouldn't waste my money on this one unless you can get it for free from a friend. There are better thrillers out there for you to read.
B005529BDK|4.0|It&apos;s very fun and challenging. Very addictive. Only one tech problem though, when its on hold or when the screen is went to  sleep or whatever the game will pause and never come back on, it freezes. But other than that its a winner.

B004EPYZUI|4.0|One thing that someone should point out is that the picture is incorrect. This item is NOT the combo pack of Blu-ray and DVD. It is a two disc blu-ray pack. That surprised me when I received it, but I decided to keep it all the same. This has more features than the combo pack does, which was fine by me. The special edition is worth getting for all of the extras that it contains, and is probably better than the combo pack (unless you have a ton of friends who doesn't own a blu-ray player or you are currently do not have a blu-ray player, but are considering buying one).     The movie doesn't have too much, if any, plot. Sure, I said it, but I still love it simply because of Snyder's visual style and music and feminist message. Almost every piece of music during the fight scenes are performed by women (and some are even covers of songs written by men). I think it is, aesthetically, a great work by Snyder. However, if you're looking for plot. Try looking elsewhere.
6305696071|5.0|Now that the Pretty Woman [10th Anniversary Special Edition] [DVD] Collection is out I find myself getting nostalgic. And so I decided to post a few ideas of inspiration from watching the movie by Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. Basically this is the story of a rich good looking guy who decides to pick up a your \\"pretty woman\\" hooker and starts to like her so much that he falls in love.    Great idea, very funny, but not really realistic. I ran across what I think is a good book, right here on Amazon that gives what I think is great \\"realistic\\" advice on how to attract a real pretty woman, \\"[[ASIN:1460918657 101 Ways To Romance A Pretty Woman: A Single Man's Guide To Dating And  Understanding Women]]\\".    If you are a single guy, looking for a \\"Pretty Woman\\" I would suggest taking a \\"look inside\\" and see if this is strikes accord and has value and provides good advice that you can use right away. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

B003XREL98|1.0|I think this is the first book I have EVER put away without finishing.  I'm an avid reader and will read almost anything, but this was just too slow for me.  I barely made it through about 3 chapters.  SNOOZER!
0061997811|4.0|When I first got this book, I was so excited! It looked fancy and contained many unfolding pages! However, when I opened the envelop of \\"Harry Potter's first letter from Hogwarts\\", it was empty! I was so surprised because there is a picture of exactly this letter about this book in Amazon. The book was covered very well when I got it, which made me more confusing. I cannot tell how disappointed I feel. Otherwise, it would be perfect.
0316077054|4.0|I took a couple of weeks to get going in this book.  I was so let down by the start of it.  I don't know if it was just that I knew there would be no Macon or what, but it just dragged for me at the beginning.  I kept going though, and after about 120 pages in, I got sucked in again and it only took like 2 days to finish.  So for everyone that picks this up and thinks about putting it down, don't give up.  Seriously, give it about 140 pages or so.  It will pick up, I promise!<br /><br />All the main characters are back from book one.  Well, almost all.  The ones that died of course aren't back.  Or ARE THEY!?! hehe...<br /><br />In book two we get a few new characters:  I really liked Liv, the new library assistant.  I did not like John, he was a douchebag.<br /><br />So this book is pretty much Ethan, Link, and Liv trying to rescue Lena from Ridley and John.  I loved the adventures in the tunnels and getting to see the caster world.  The descriptions were great and you could almost feel like you had been there.  That is good story telling.<br /><br />This next bit is totally SPOILERISH so skip it if you need to.<br /><br />When I realized that MACON was alive, I lost it.  I mean (and OMGosh! I am totally tearing up just writing about it now!), I started crying so hard.  He was by far my favorite character in book one and when they killed him off it killed me.  So when they brought him back... ugh!  I cried from that point on!  I couldn't put the book down, didn't want to be without him, afraid they would kill him off again before I picked it back up.  When I finally finished reading the book, I even tweeted Kami Garcia and told her \\"THANK YOU, for Macon.\\"  I'm sure she thought I was a loon, she didn't reply, but I felt like they brought him back... just for ME.<br /><br />So for me, the last half of the book totally made up for the slow start.  When a book is so good, it makes you send a txt to the author to THANK them... yeah, that's a good book.<br /><br />I can NOT wait to get my hands on Beautiful Chaos (Beautiful Creatures, Book 3).ul Creatures, Book 3).

B004EC5IUW|4.0|Well that was a surprise, after the first movie, no one knew what to expect from Rebuild of Evangelion 2.22 You can(not)Advance , Also known Evangelion New Theatrical Edition Break, With the first movie being a shot for shot remake of episodes 1-6 of the TV series, people were disappointing that Hideaki Anno gave us the finger, again, and suckered our money, again. So colored me shocked that this new movie blew almost everyone away, if at least for the fact that the last one was so disappointing.<br />  Eva 1.11 was a straight up remake of the beginning of the TV show, but Eva 2.22 is a spiritual remake of episodes 7-24 and the movie, End of Evangelion, it breaks off from the TV series in a multitude of ways, characters personalities are slightly adjusted, the angels aren't named anymore, and there are new characters and themes. For good or bad or cynic, Eva 2.22 manages to step out of its legacy by whatever means possible(I mean, whoever makes a Quadrilogy?) For instance the new character, Mari. Mari is the Pooche to Ichi & Scratchy, she is cool, she is focus tested, and she takes things TO THE EXTREME  but, like Poochie, she is VERY SHALLOW; Mari has 3 scenes in the movie, and she has very little importance in each of them, you could literally edit her out of the movie and have it still be a cohesive movie; it was a bad marketing move on the PR team to bold, underline, and highlight her presence in the movie but maybe considering what happens at the end of the movie, Mari will have more time to shine in the next movie, but until then, she is just another cynical attempt to milk this franchise.<br />  But even with all this, Eva 2.22 is breathtaking, every battle is a duel to the death, the animation is amazing, and the choice of music is haunting. The symbolism has also been improved, they are leaning much less on the shallow Christianity and Jewish Kabbalah symbolism and more on characters and politics, and, this will be a decisive point between critics, the TV series, Neon Genesis Evangelion, many parts of this movie call back to certain scenes in the TV show and in some cases build on them, leading to wild speculation by fans, some might say that this defeats the point of this Quadrilogy's agenda to introduce new fans to Eva, but in my mind it doesn't. While your enjoyment of this movie will increase or decrease greatly if you seen the original TV series, it still all fits within the context of these movies.<br />  While the past 2 movies lie in the originals shadow, if they creators of this movie can keep this up, this series will end up as the stronger work, But since they re-imagined the whole TV show, they have to make up whole new stuff from this point on, and that will be the true test; but Rebuild of Evangelion 2.22 You Can (Not) Advance earns its name in every respect of the word. Lets just hope that doesn't come back to bite them.ies, Neon Genesis Evangelion, many parts of this movie call back to certain scenes in the TV show and in some cases build on them, leading to wild speculation by fans, some might say that this defeats the point of this Quadrilogy's agenda to introduce new fans to Eva, but in my mind it doesn't.

My only complaint is that I feel this workout is too short, so I will probably do it twice or do two levels back to back.  Also, I am a big fan and user of P90X which has very intense workouts, so this may be the reason why I felt this one was short and less intense than expected after reading the reviews.  Overall, I would recommend it because it's nice to have different workout videos to change things up so you don't get bored.

0345308239|5.0|The historian Carl Becker stated, \\"History is the memory of things said and done.\\"<br />  The overwhelming majority of individuals who make their living as historians are attached to institutions of higher learning as teachers and researchers. They hold advanced degrees in their discipline and have settled into professorships that provide them both a lectern to share their knowledge with students and the means to pursue their specific lines of interest. When they publish the results of their probing into the past, as they necessarily must, their colleagues critique their work. Aware that unconscious cultural biases that gain the blessing of the academy can be as seditious as they intentional perpetuation of prejudices, and relying on their own views and methodologies, the history doctors will sharpen their scalpels and examine the new work for pathologies. Spirited discussion will ensue.<br />  Preserving the \\"memory of things said and done\\" is not the exclusive province of professionals. There are also historians who practice outside the formal confines of academic approval. Their work is not subject to peer review, but relies instead on popular acceptance. Their general audience, not having the resources or the expertise to challenge the work presented to them, must trust the honesty of the historian, learn to recognize authors with a particular axe to grind, and keep their skepticism within reach.<br />  Barbara Tuchman (1912 - 1989) stood outside the academic pale. She was a graduate of Radcliffe College (1933) with a strong background in history and literature, but she never obtained an advanced degree in any field and was never associated with a university. She was not a professional historian with a talent for writing, but a superb writer with a passion for historical subjects, as attested by her Pulitzer prizes for \\"The Guns of August\\" (1962) and for \\"Stilwell and the American Experience in China\\" (1971).<br />  In \\"The March of Folly\\" (1984), Tuchman poses the hypothesis that governments often pursue policies contrary to their own interests. She offers seven preliminary examples and four detailed case studies, one drawn from mythic literature and three from history.<br />  \\"Pursuit of Policy Contrary to Self-Interest\\" (1) The obstinacy of King Rehoboam of Israel precipitates a civil war that forever divides the twelve tribes. (2) The superstition of Montezuma, ruler of an Aztec empire of five million people, abets Spanish conquest by Cortes with 600 soldiers. (3) In the late 6th century, the Visigoth king Recared attempts to unify the antagonistic Arian Christian and Roman Catholic factions in the Iberian Peninsula, making the fateful decision to elevate the Catholics to supreme authority, initiating two centuries of land seizures and persecutions of non-Christians. In 711, the Jews invite the Moors to invade Spain, resulting in the establishment of an Islamic civilization in southern Europe that would persist for nearly 800 years. (4) The 72-year reign of Louis XIV exhausts the resources of France through ceaseless wars and the counterproductive suppression of the Huguenots, setting the table for the French Revolution. (5) After 35 years of revolution, counter-revolution and Napoleonic reign, Charles X, aided by his state-subsidized Ultras, tries to reconstitute the shattered monarchy in France, reminding everyone that Bourbon dynasts \\"learn nothing and forget nothing.\\" (6) The German High Command decides to resume unlimited submarine warfare in January 1917 based on their invalid estimation of American readiness to enter the First World War on the side of the Allied Powers. (7) Recalling the success of their preemptive strike against Port Arthur in 1904, the Japanese try to ensure their ambitions for a Pacific empire with a knockout blow against the United States at Pearl Harbor in 1941.<br />  \\"Prototype: The Trojans Take The Wooden Horse Within Their Walls\\" The tale from Homer's \\"Odyssey\\" relates how wiser heads among the Trojans are ignored when they are presented with the Wooden Horse left behind by the Greeks.<br />  \\"The Renaissance Popes Provoke The Protestant Secession: 1470 - 1530\\" A succession of six popes in the late 15th and early 16th centuries turn a deaf ear to cries for reform of the Church, use their pontificates to exercise secular power and deplete the Vatican treasury for armed connivance against their enemies, for grandiose displays of their status, and for enrichment of their families, making inevitable the Protestant Reformation.<br />  \\"The British Lose America\\" Beginning with the reasonable hope of recovering the costs of defending their American colonists in the French - Indian War (1756 - 1763), the ineptitude of British cabinet ministers, the intractability of negligent attitudes toward the Americas, the demands of a mercantilist economic system, and incessant intrigues and antagonisms between England and France contribute to Great Britain's loss of the American colonies.<br />  \\"America Betrays Herself In Vietnam\\" Fear of Communist expansionism, the Revolution in China, and domestic political pressure from the right push America into attempting to control Vietnamese destiny after the expulsion of France from Indochina. Thirty years of American military and economic involvement (dating from the supply of U.S. military transport for French troops to restore colonial control in 1945 through the fall of Saigon in 1975) yield disastrous results.<br />  Tuchman described her works as \\"chronological narrative\\". She understood the methods of historical research and used primary sources (diaries, memoirs, correspondence, archival records, site visits, interviews with principals) whenever possible. She made a point of having no overall philosophy of history, but saw instead \\"human conduct as a steady stream running through endless fields of changing circumstances\\" and realized the importance of allowing research material to shape her view rather than imposing her view on the material. Her training as a journalist with \\"The Nation\\" (owned by her father, Maurice Wertheim) served her well, gracing her literary style with confident brevity, a sharp sense of the salient fact or incident, and just the right touch of wit.<br />  Barbara Tuchman's collected writings constitute a splendid \\"memory of things said and done.\\" In \\"The March of Folly\\" she does not despair of human wisdom, but advances the case that its presence in government is unfortunately rare.Trojans are ignored when they are presented with the Wooden Horse left behind by the Greeks.      \\"The Renaissance Popes Provoke The Protestant Secession: 1470 - 1530\\" A succession of six popes in the late 15th and early 16th centuries turn a deaf ear to cries for reform of the Church, use their pontificates to exercise secular power and deplete the Vatican treasury for armed connivance against their enemies, for grandiose displays of their status, and for enrichment of their families, making inevitable the Protestant Reformation.      \\"The British Lose America\\" Beginning with the reasonable hope of recovering the costs of defending their American colonists in the French - Indian War (1756 - 1763), the ineptitude of British cabinet ministers, the intractability of negligent attitudes toward the Americas, the demands of a mercantilist economic system, and incessant intrigues and antagonisms between England and France contribute to Great Britain's loss of the American colonies.      \\"America Betrays Herself In Vietnam\\" Fear of Communist expansionism, the Revolution in China, and domestic political pressure from the right push America into attempting to control Vietnamese destiny after the expulsion of France from Indochina.

1451629184|5.0|What an amazing woman Jaycee turned out to be after her horrendous 18-year life with a sexual monster.  I admire her philosophy of getting on with life and becoming the best she can be. The book details every aspect of her captivity in straightforward words which pulls on your heartstrings and you'd just like to give her a big hug.  Courageous story of survival.
1451629184|5.0|In 1991 at the age of eleven, Jaycee Dugard was kidnapped by Phillip Garrido and his wife.  Kept as their prisoner for 18 years, she survived unthinkable sexual and emotional abuse at the hands of her kidnappers.  Contact with the outside world was severely restricted, when existent at all.  Even her name was erased and changed for another one.  How does a person, a child, survive?  In her memoir, A STOLEN LIFE, Jaycee Dugard tells the story of her captivity, the reunion with her true family and her movement forward to a future of freedom.  Her goals are not only to speak out against the silence forced upon her, against Phillip Garrido's belief no one should know what happened, but also to hold him accountable.  She no longer keeps the secret.  So often victims are made to feel shame for crimes against them, but Jaycee Dugard claims her life in this memoir, all of her life, and puts the shame where it belongs.  She is not so much a victim as a survivor.  Jaycee Dugard's story is a story of survival and hope.  In writing this book, her stated goals are, that in speaking out, others might gain the courage to speak out when something seems wrong.  She wants others to know they can survive tough situations and thrive.<br /><br />In A STOLEN LIFE, Jaycee Dugard lives up to those goals and much more.  The most horrible moments are not censored.  One feels outrage towards Phillip Garrido and his wife as well at the Justice department's inability to stop the crime even when parole officers are on the scene.  Readers should be prepared.  The descriptions of the sexual abuse are narrated through a child's eye, thus drawing the reader in with a directness and rawness rather than a sense of detachment.  While her story definitely holds the abuser accountable, A STOLEN LIFE itself does not drag a reader down into the morass of Phillip Garrido's psychology.  One sees how he manipulates her, but in her ability to reveal and unmask the manipulation with her words, one feels the power shifting within her.  What strikes this reader the most is the richness of her inner life even in the most restricted of circumstances.  Her love of animals strikes a reader with a sense of genuineness and goodness, not only in the early scenes of captivity, but also in the more difficult moments of therapy as she learns more about herself.<br /><br />The easy to read prose style is simple without being simplistic.  Jaycee Dugard's powerful use of imagery captures the heart of the scene effortlessly without a stilted self-consciousness or over-analysis that might accompany a story of this type.  A STOLEN LIFE is deeply inspirational in much the same way.  By not sugar-coating or minimizing the events, the message of survival and even hope has all the more power.  From the first page, A STOLEN LIFE is impossible to put down.  Jaycee Dugard's A STOLEN LIFE is unforgettable and very highly recommended.  This reader hopes that when the celebrity of Jaycee Dugard's story dies down, that if the dream of writing still appeals, she will continue to write.  Her ability to use words is quite powerful.<br /><br />A portion of thee proceeds of the memoir will be donated to the JAYC Foundation, Inc.  The JAYC Foundation provides support and services to ensure the timely treatment of families that are recovering from abduction and the aftermath of other traumatic experiences.<br /><br />Courtesy of Book Illuminationsfting within her.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|A welcome change from the vampire genre (which I enjoy, but which is overdone, especially in YA literature), The Hunger Games is an engaging, near-future dystopian novel that draws in the reader from its beginning.  Katniss Everdeen is a teenage girl responsible for the well-being of her mother and younger sister since the death of her father in a mining accident.  They live in Panem, a country built from the ashes of the USA, in an outer area called District 12.  It is a mining community, rustic and oppressed by the shiny, technologically driven, frivolous Capitol.  Katniss is only truly happy when she is in the woods, (illegally) hunting with her friend, Gale.  Kat's life changes drastically when her sister is chosen for the Hunger Games - a barbaric, to-the-death version of Survivor in which the players are teens from each of the 12 districts.  Kat volunteers to take her sister's place along side the baker's son, Peeta, and by doing so, starts a chain-reaction of events that lead to a compelling conclusion.    Suzanne Collins has created vivid characters, and she gives us a protagonist that is almost an anti-hero - a rarity in adolescent novels.  Despite her sometimes rough demeanor, the reader can't help but like Katniss, especially as she navigates the treacherous waters of emotions and politics while simply trying to stay alive.  I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone middle school or older.

1594134324|5.0|When I first sat down to read this book, I wasn't sure what I was getting into. All throughout the experience of reading the book, I kept having people come up to me and talk about how important the book was, how much they'd heard about it, but for some reason not a single one of the people who came up to me actually sat down and read the book in its entirety. I did have one say she got about 1/4 of the way through it, but that was about it. So this got me to wonder what was the real story behind this book.    Going into the book, I should point out that my background is in genetics. I have done some extensive research on the topic, even having majored in it when I went back to college the last time around. However, as much as I could tell you all about cells, mitosis, and about all of the nuances of cell biology, it was through reading this book taht I never really got into the subject of who those cells belonged to. The story the author tells is one of Henrietta Lacks, and even more about everything that had to do with her descendants as well. The author really gets into the nitty details of this family's life and the struggles they have gone through just trying to get beyond the realization that one of the greatest accomplishments in medical science was tied to the \\"donated\\" cells of their long lost relative.    The author really gets into the uncovering of her subject and does it in a way that never feels clinical, boring or opinionated (at least until the very end AFTER the story is told). Yet the story does bring up a lot of very important ethical questions that she never attempts to answer, pretty much leaving those questions for the reader to bring forth on their own time.    It was an amazing undertaking by the author, and I'm glad I read it. I don't often give 5 stars to a book these days, but this one should be read by anyone who cares about other human beings, and especially by those who might not....

I have the other albums including the newer stuff, but so far this one is my definate pick out of all MCR's recordings.  I love that they included the lyrics also as this is an important part of music to me.  I can listen to this album over and over and it never gets old and I don't push skip.

0062059882|4.0|I have only ever read two books by Neil Gaiman(please don't lynch me) and they have both been religiously themed, i.e., Good Omens and American Gods.  I can't for the life of me think why it's taken so long to getting around to this one.<br /><br />In my defence, while this 10th Anniversary Edition is a review copy, I do actually own another battered copy of its first iteration, unread, along with its spin-off sibling Anansi Boys- both languish on the TBR shelf.<br /><br />The story, for the uninitiated...<br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />After three years in prison, Shadow has done his time. But as the time until his release ticks away, he can feel a storm brewing. Two days before he gets out, his wife Laura dies in a mysterious car crash, in adulterous circumstances. Dazed, Shadow travels home, only to encounter the bizarre Mr Wednesday claiming to be a refugee from a distant war, a former god and the king of America.<br /><br />Together they embark on a very strange journey across the States, along the way solving the murders which have occurred every winter in one small American town. But the storm is about to break... Disturbing, gripping and profoundly strange, Gaiman's epic new novel sees him on the road to the heart of America. [Headline Books]<br /><br />So how can one give a review of a book that is beloved of so many, which has been read and reviewed over the last decade and still be fresh.<br /><br />I'll try.<br /><br />Gaiman weaves a number of threads together in this work.  It's a story about gods, travel murder, change,  gah! the more I pick at it the more things it seems to be.  So to begin I'll break it down.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman meets Route 66<br />--------------------------------<br /><br />American Gods felt very much like a road trip, despite the fact that a significant portion of the travel in the book was by plane.  Perhaps it's mention of certain American landmarks and iconic places .  Maybe the stereotypes that the gods inhabit, hark back to an older America.  I feel the weight of nostalgia, for things lost in a vast open landscape.<br /><br />That Gaiman can generate this feeling in me I think speaks for the strength of his prose, as in retrospect, there's not actually that much travel.<br /><br />Everyone comes to America, even the gods.<br />--------------------------------------------<br /><br />Aiding this perception is the fact that it's an immigrant tale as well. A tale of the tired, the poor, the huddled masses and the gods they carried with them. Many of the gods bear the accents and the mannerisms of the culture they spring from and in Shadow traveling to meet them, the reader is given a sense of the cultural diversity that is the melting pot of America, the gods journey there and their slow strung out demise.<br /><br />Yggdrasil versus the Matrix<br />----------------------------<br /><br />Entwined with these themes is that of change, old gods versus new - the gods of internet, credit cards and fibre optics. Is this is a comment on what America has become, a land of the almighty dollar, the land of the instant gratification? I am not sure.<br /><br />The Missing God<br /><br />One thing that did strike me as odd was the omission of Jesus.  If any god would be in America you'd think it would be Jesus, but he's conspicuous in his absence, apparently he's in Afghanistan.  Did Gaiman do this deliberately?  He mentions Jesus in the twitter interview printed in the back of this version, but it doesn't answer the question of Jesus' absence or apparent aloofness. Was he playing it safe?<br /><br />Murder Mystery & Confidence Tricks<br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />There's a murder mystery entwined in the story as well, but the less said about that the better as it's a nice little twist.<br /><br />There's coin tricks and confidence tricks through out the novel, magic and misdirection. Gaiman uses it both as plot device and on a meta level(this should hit you at the end, or before, if you are sharper than me). There's something about old time confidence tricks that harks back to a bygone America, face to face cons that required an understanding of human psychology.<br /><br />Summing up<br />------------------<br /><br />This is the authors preferred text, it's a little longer and obviously varies from the first itteration. It includes a twitter interview, as well as a novella featuring Shadow called Monarch of the Glen.  I doubt that I would go back and read the first edition, it's not a tale that I think, given my present reading load, that would be of any benefit and this is after all  Gaiman's preferred story.<br /><br />For Gaiman fans that haven't read this version, it would be worth it if you haven't read the tale in awhile.  American Gods is not one of those pacey pot boilers you read in an afternoon.  It's a book to be savoured and enjoyed, it's a book that requires attention.<br /><br />For some one who is new to Gaiman I'd recommend this version.  It's not as I have said, a pacey read, but an unfolding journey of discovery with a couple of twists that I and perhaps you won't see coming.<br /><br />This was a review copy provided by Headline.e cons that required an understanding of human psychology.

B003Y5H53S|2.0|This movie was not funny nor was it entertaining.The creatures/animals in this movie could give kids nightmares.Boring all the way through.This movie was just plain weird.I will give one extra star for the animation though.To bad it's not enough to save this movie.
B004UID2LC|3.0|This definitely gets the job done, allowing me to search or use my channel list to get videos.     The UI is clunky, with things like press and hold to get a menu where you always choose the same thing (download as video). It attempts to download several videos at once, but if you queue up too many, it tries to do them all in parallel, and then you have to wait for them all and if anything goes wrong you have requeue them all. You're better off doing a few at a time.    Additionally, it will stop working frequently, because YouTube deliberately disables it by changing their interface. They seem to be pretty good about putting out new updates to make it work again.    At the end of the day, though, it works and allows me to download a bunch of videos and watch them off-line, like on the plane. That's pretty good value for free.
B000ICLRIE|4.0|A very enjoyable and entertaining film about the Muslim conquest of Jerusalem.  Strong performances set  against beautiful backdrops.  Story line is well done, and the viewer is swept along with a sense of  urgency and doom.  Well worth viewing, and an excellent buy for anyone who likes epic fight scenes and  battles.
1932100660|5.0|This book changed my life. Since reading it I've lost an amazing amount of weight and feel surprisingly healthier in just a few months. Rather than trying to sell you another snake oil weight loss diet, the book actually fundamentally changes how you think about food. The data presented is so compelling that it's undeniable, you can't help but eat differently after you've read it.
B004OZOTSQ|1.0|Drop Box is better.  This forces close on my Epic and my husbands Evo. Something is very fishy about all these 5 star reviews.
B004OZOTSQ|3.0|For those who think no security over WiFi is &quot;secure,&quot; I hope you never connect to a public access point, school or corporate network, or ever have to travel. To the developer: security should always be the default condition. Great app, but user beware: your files are exposed to anyone on your wireless network.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Makes pretty good predictions and saves typing. My recommendation to users is to turn off the \\"space bar will complete the current word\\" and change it to \\"always insert a space\\". Also, I cannot understand why this program will not automatically change an \\"i\\" by itself (one word) to an \\"I\\". Unless you are a mathematician, when would you ever type an \\"i\\" by itself and not need it capitalized? I wrote to the developers with this suggested change about 6 mo ago.
0062060554|4.0|When Christine awakens every morning it is with a mental clean slate. Due to an accident she loses a large piece of her life every time she sleeps.  I was hooked from the first page.  As the book progressed there were times you truly got a sense of how she must feel as she tries to sort through all of the pieces.  I found myself unable to put the book down.
1932100660|5.0|This is a fantastic book which finally gives scientific information behind the nutrition recomendations.  I have read many books on nutrition which often seem to be based on someone's opinon.  After reading the China Study I have continued to do additional research and want to continue learning about this topic.  I have changed the way I eat and have been working to share this information with friends and family as I believe it is so important for reversing and preventing disease.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Learn how to search. Its there and has a ton of reviews and four stars. This is a great app, happy to receive it.  And to the person who said why use wifi on a phone..... Are you a troll?
1932100660|5.0|This book has changed my eating habits forever. Couldn't put it down from start to finish. Everyone who cares about their health, and will be proactive to change their lifestyle should read this book. You can't afford not to read it.
B00505ETV6|4.0|What I Can Tell You:<br />I may be the only book lover that has never read Vanity Fair so I had no idea what to expect. This was a fun movie to watch. It was a perfect way to spend a rainy day with the kids involved in their games, I sat at the computer and wished I had someone to watch it with.<br /><br />Becky Sharp is one naughty girl. She cracked me up from the beginning of the movie when she told off the school marms of Miss Pinkerton's Academy for Young Ladies. I knew from that moment, I was going to love her. The story is good. The writing, well, obviously the book is a classic for a reason. The characters are fleshy and real. I never thought the movie boring considering it is a BBC and not a big budget, extravaganza, full of action like I usually watch. The dialogue is what makes this so awesome. There is a ton of witty banter that made me smile through much of the movie.<br /><br />I also love Amelia Sedley who is horribly in love with George Osborne but has a puppy dog secret admiror in his friend, William Dobbin.<br /><br />The characters are well acted.  The clothing and set amazing. The production a bit bland but it was perfect for this book adaptation which was written in 1847.<br /><br />If you love the classics, you will love spending a few hours with Vanity Fair on DVD.
0385341679|5.0|I cannot tell you how anxiously I awaited this release and it did not disappoint. All questions answered, big stories wrapped up and I thought all in all a perfect ending to such an incredible story. Karen Moning did NOT disappoint me at all with Shadowfever. LOVE LOVE LOVE this entire series and this book.
B001AQO3QA|2.0|I bought this being a big fan of the Aliens movies, but got the DVD and it was not region 1 is was some copy from the UK. Very misleading picture of the dvd. Dissapointed.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I love this app. the graphs are great net eng must have. great addition to the android tool kit.  worth the time to download this app
1451629184|5.0|I loved the book...it bought tears to my eyes just reading what this women had to go through. I wish her the best and recommend everyone to read it if you have followed her story. Enjoy!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game that relaxes as it challenges you? I love playing it so far, and look forward to more levels and challenges.
B005BZQS1E|4.0|If you can handle stoner humor, stupid guy jokes and the concept of taking battle trophies, you'll like this movie. I watched it with a glass of whiskey and a couple good friends. We laughed our butts off. Obviously not for kids so don't even add them into the mix. Enjoy.
0439023491|5.0|Brought you right back into the story, and kept your interest up to the end.  Wanted to know what was going to happen next.  We shared this series around work and everyone was hungry for the next book.
1451629184|3.0|Dugard explains that writing this memoir was part of her therapy, and I hope it helped her. But it's clear she's a long, long, long way from healed. I point this out only because about every 4 or 5 pages she goes into how blessed she is and how she's living a wonderful and happy and fulfilling life now that everything is all better. The writing style belies that. There's at least one shoddily-written sentence on nearly every page, and there are very few paragraph breaks. The narrative just sort of spills out onto you in one big gush. I'm still not sure whether this is a deliberate stylistic choice to represent the state of mind of a young girl in terrible circumstances, or if the editor was simply asleep on the job. As other reviewers have noted, the narrative is extremely disjointed, almost to the point where you're tempted to stop following. We get loads of detail about her pets, though almost none about her daughters, and I'm not sure the inclusion of every single page of her cat-diary adds anything (except page legth).    Maybe the shift from super-detailed to super-vague happens because, at some point, the real Jaycee got Stockholm Syndrome and the reader doesn't. She did lose me somewhat when she started lamenting how her captor would take her out in public to nail salons, restaurants, etc., and yet \\"Nobody looked at me...no one said, `Hey, aren't you that missing girl?'\\" Sorry, but I'm not taking part in collective guilt for that. The parts where she staunchly sits in the police station and lies to protect her kidnapper and rapist are especially hard to empathize with. She also occasionally goes into unnecessary preaching mode, explaining at length why is it is wrong to kidnap and rape and imprison an 11-yer-old girl. Overall, this should probably have been an ongoing blog or a feature-length article in a magazine (one that permits graphically disturbing detail) rather than published as a \\"complete\\" memoir.
0439023513|4.0|I suppose you have to expect some let down at the end of a really good story. Maybe its just that it ended.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|This was a good reader app, especially since the Kindle book purchases worked on PC app and Android app. I have the Pandigital Novel, which runs Android 2.0. But when the Kindle app for Android was updated to support Android 2.1+, that meant the app was not longer compatible with my Novel. Fortunately, I have access to the older Kindle app versions [...] (version 2.05), so as long as Amazon still allows those older versions to connect and download, I will be happy.<br /><br />Yep, looks like it still works... for now.
140053271X|5.0|Easy to use, good battery, no need additional soft, only Calibre to convert e-books.  Just need correct device firmware interface, to make it more useful:   - Remember last 5 Read now books. (Not 1, because e-reader can use other friends/partners and read different books)  - Remember each book stop reading page, if I restart book again.  - Need slide toolbar for quick select directory, shelf  etc.
0439023491|5.0|Would this book never come in at the library for me? I finally broke down and used a gift card to buy it while on a Wal-Mart run. (That doesn't count as really buying a book, does it? No money was actually exchanged.)<br /><br />I'm glad I did. I don't often buy fiction, but this was ten dollars well spent. And, of course, like book one, book two left me desperate to read book three.
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|Ignore the religious nut & their review. It's just a movie dude, lighten up, it's not to be taken seriously!     If you like movies such as \\"Shaun Of The Dead\\" you'll love this. Really funny & the effects are just great. Paul pokes fun at lots of subjects & does it in a non-offensive, comical way. There's a lot of cussing, lots of action, great story, hilarious characters, what more can you want from a lighthearted, well made movie?
0312243022|5.0|I saw this as a wonderful look<br />at our human difficulty in<br />living a life that is at once<br />both everyday and exceptional.<br />An incredible book that held up<br />very well to a second reading.
1451629184|5.0|This books is simply written and well written. It will hold your attention. Jaycee gets out on the written page, the pain and confusion and agony she experienced. It is a very good read. Your heart will be with her every minute.
0316098329|5.0|Best fiction book of the year for me. Read it.<br /><br />Enough said.<br /><br />(Backstory:  I kept seeing this book everywhere, on every blog I visited, every bookstore I stopped in. I do not like stories where children are treated badly. This did not look like a book for me. Several bloggers urged me to try it, despite my worries. I'm glad I did.)
B0000060NH|5.0|After reading the reviewer's trashing of this absolute GEM I agree with the reviewers that the gentleman apparently has no clue what makes a good album.This same person also trashed the Temps Emporers Of Soul and Mellow Mood CD's also, so maybe he should review bluegrass instead.I had the album since I was a Junior in high school,and the CD for at least 11 years.I can't speak for anyone else but in my opinion Marvin Gaye,David Ruffin,Levi Stubbs,Smokey Robinson,Eddie Kendricks,Dennis Edwards & Michael Jackson were the top male vocalists at Motown.This album is in my mind one of Marvin's top 5.I put it at the top of the soundtrack list with Superfly & Shaft.No matter what went on in his personal life he always delivered A+ product.He was an original,unfortunately he was not with us nearly long enough.RIP!!!
0679735909|5.0|I've considered Possession one of<br />my favorites since I first read it<br />in 1990. I loved the parallel stories.<br />In many ways, it reminds me of another<br />favorite, The Gold Bug Variations.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|This was a very cute film, and best of all my son loved it and now I have something to distract him with when needed.
0375758992|5.0|This book makes an interesting<br />counterpoint to my last read,<br />If a Place Can Make You Cry.<br />An English family, in this<br />memoir, moves to Africa and,<br />despite war and mosquitos<br />and disease and deadly snakes,<br />Africa rapidly becomes home.<br /><br />(Read and reviewed in 2003)
B000FVE3AC|4.0|This is a very nice looking watch.  It looks like the quality timepiece that it is.  It's got the heft to prove that it's built from solid, surgical-grade stainless steel.  It's a cinch to operate, you just set the time once and it's self winding (no battery, but powered by wrist movements) - but you have to wear it, since if you let it sit for a few days it slows down.  (Note that it comes big, so unless you've got enormous forearms, you'll need to take it to a jeweler to fit it, or adjust it yourself like I did after looking up how to do it online; even though I have large wrists I had to remove two of the links before I could adjust this to fit just right.)<br /><br />The crown locks down, which helps ensure the water resistance.  You just unscrew it and pull it out to set the time and date.  It's bare bones as far as features go, but that adds to the elegant simplicity.  There's no alarm clock, no calculator, no digital timer, no multiple time zones.  It just tells the time and the date, and the rotating bezel allows you use it as a timer (just rotate it to line up with the minute hand and wait until it reaches a deadline up to sixty minutes).<br /><br />I have to say, I'm not a Pro Diver.  I don't ever expect to wear this underwater to 300 meters.  I use it to tell time - and I don't always wear it since it is a bit heavy.  You do feel its weight when you wear it, which is kind of cool, but could be a bit of a distraction for everyday use.  I think of it more like a useful ornament that I'll wear when I dress up.  For most days, I've got a much less expensive plastic digital watch with some of the frills they decided - probably wisely - that for the purposes of this watch were just not necessary.
1612930174|5.0|This is a book I never expected to like. I have to admit that I sometimes get lost in books with complicated plot lines. My perception of this book was that it might be overly dramatic. I sometimes find books regarded as classics as intimidating. I was very worried that I might get lost in the plot or that the story might be overly dramatic or that I might find the text to be intimidating.<br /><br />I'm happy to report that none of these things happened. I found this book to be one of the best books I've read. The plot is clever and unexpected, but easy to follow. The characters are dramatic but also witty and funny. And the text was surprisingly easy to read.<br /><br />Add another tally mark for me for Classics I've Read and Loved.
B0053YEM7U|5.0|Listened over and over and this should rank as the seventh best Yes album of all-time. This is the best stuff Yes has released since the 70's. I'd rank them as follows: (1) 1971 Fragile; (2) 1974 Relayer; (3) 1971 The Yes Album; (4) 1972 Close to the Edge; (5) 1973 Tales From Topographic Oceans; (6) 1977 Going for the One; (7) 2011 Fly From Here; (8) 1983 90125; (9) 2001 Magnification; (10) 1980 Drama    Yes, the Fly From Here album is better than the Drama album which it is most being compared to.  Drama was very good but Fly From Here takes that sound to a higher level. I like the 1978 Tormato album, but Fly From Here has now knocked it out of the Yes top 10 in my opinion. Also, Yes certainly has some great live albums, but I don't find the live stuff as enjoyable or rewarding as their studio stuff. The 1996 & 1997 Keys to Ascension albums have some really good studio stuff which can all be found in one place on Keystudio. Perhaps Keystudio could be #9 on my list above. It would be if it felt like a real album effort from Yes and not a compilation.    Fly From Here delivers as well as any great Yes album. Great sounds and musicianship dominate the album. The six-part Fly From Here is epic. The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be is good enough to fit right into Chris Squire's Fish Out of Water album which is probably the best Yes solo album ever released. Life On A Film Set and Hour Of Need are beautiful songs. Solitaire is more fine work from Steve Howe who will always be incredibly under-rated for his outstanding guitar contributions to music. The album then finishes strong with the full band effort of Into the Storm.    A very well-produced album with great sound. A great album cover. I'm not sure what Yes may have missed here. Doesn't sound rushed (of course it was decades in the works). Both Squire and Howe sound great. Alan White sounds good on drums. Geoff Downes does a fine job on keyboards and I don't miss Rick Wakeman or any other Yes keyboardists. And finally, Benoit David. He has a wonderful voice. He also sounds excellent when singing old Yes songs. No, he isn't Jon Anderson. But he is a pleasure to listen to. Taking nothing away from Benoit, but if the all-time great Jon Anderson was the lead vocals on this album, it just may have been the 4th or 5th greatest Yes album of all-time. Nonetheless, a great job done and easily one of the best albums in the last 30 years by the great rock legends from the 70's and early 80's.
030746363X|1.0|I bought this book because Dr. Oz suggested it, but after buying this book what a waste of money.  His diet is basically a no carb diet with one day where you can eat all the food you want. He says not to eat fruit but once a week because your body really doesn't need fruit. I tried the diet and I felt terrible.  I did loose weight, but when I went off the diet after a week for that one day I gained all the weight back.  It was hard to follow and it was not worth the up and down roller coaster that I was on.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|Rango, a kooky pet chameleon, lands by accident, in a wild western town called Dirt.  This movie is has a great original script that is an attention holder. Eye-popping animation and hilarious visuals add to the mix.  Johnny Depps voice matches perfectly with his character.  The cast of town folk and critters blend nicely to this unique story and Rango becomes a town hero through his bumbling mistakes. Lots of fun and laughter, but a PG rating due to a few inappropriate words and adult humor. Suitable for children 12 and older.  Good conquers evil and Rango conquers my heart!!
B004LROMWU|4.0|I enjoyed it, and I'm looking forward to season 2.  They avoided a lot of the stupid traps that a show like this usually falls into, and keep some of the characters interesting enough.  Some SPOILERS follow:  Too many shows will have frightening aliens like the Skitters that somehow are also intelligent enough and dextrous enough to have developed interstellar flight, despite not acting it. I was glad to see the skitters weren't the top aliens. And I was afraid the 1st season ending was going to say how much better the aliens are than us, despite their massacring humans. They didn't do this. In fact, they're showing that despite what kids that have been harnessed think, they are not good guys.    However, they do seem to think Massachusetts is smaller than it is; no you cannot walk from Acton to Westminster in 1/2 day. Some of the other trips would have to be on highways where they'd get caught.  The school they hide in does look somewhat like Acton-Boxborough High School, but not exactly. But that school has no tunnel, and there are no houses as close as shown.  And they look all scruffy - except for their hair. Somehow, shampoo didn't get looted, I guess.  But those are minor faults; they concept works, and they haven't fallen into the \\"sci-fi\\" trap.
0553801473|3.0|I want to start by saying that whenever I finish a book that I have questions about I look to Amazon reviews for insight and perspective.  And I find it, even when I disagree.  I glanced at the star rating for ADWD the day my copy of the book arrived; a mere day or so after the book was available; there were 300 reviews and the average star rating was 3.  When I finished the book and returned to Amazon to get insight and perspective, there were over 750 reviews.  It was telling that the reviews considered most helpful by readers were the 2 and 3 star ones written by people who loved the series and were disappointed in ADWD.  I agree with some comments about slow plot development; non-resolution of storylines; endless, irrelevant details, repetitions and cruelties; lack of critical editing; and the great Theon story arc.  I disagree with other comments, some of which I will address in the body of this piece, but my main focus is discussing ADWD and ASOFAI from another perspective.<br /><br />There will be SPOILERS--be so advised.<br /><br />AGOT begins at Winterfell with the Stark family awaiting Ned's good friend and king Robert Baratheon.  We quickly learn: Starks are our heroes; King Robert is good, but flawed; Lannisters are bad.  Fiercely loyal and honorable Ned, bringing his daughters with him, follows King Robert to Court.  At the same time, Ned sends his mysteriously origined bastard son off to exile at the ever cold Wall where men serve until death, taking no wives, fathering no children and getting their head cut off if they decide that that hard, thankless life isn't for them.  We gather he does this because his wife doesn't like being reminded of her husband's infidelity.<br /><br />Through-out AGOT, we accept that Robert Baratheon belongs on the Iron Throne because Mad King Aeyrs Targaryen was unfit to rule.  The one person who might have a better claim to the Iron Throne, Prince Viserys, is horrible.  Possibly less horrible than Prince Joffrey, but we never find out.  About the time Ned gets his head cut-off, Daenerys Stormborn brings magic back into the world.<br /><br />I think that the themes, progression and journey of the whole series are set out in the second book, ACOK, in two Daenerys POV chapters: 1) when Quaithe gives her advice and 2) when Daenerys visits the House of the Undying Ones.  I often return to the latter POV to get a sense of where the story is going.  This is the great reversal of the series; as it continues we learn that we were misled into believing that King Robert belonged on the throne, that he was good and the Stark family noble.  Robert Baratheon was a Usurper and his pal Ned Stark, a traitor.  The Iron Throne belongs to House Targaryen.  A digression here:  Ned's death was shocking, but not unreasonable: when a character is maimed--Ned's leg was surely gangrenous--and his story arc has no place to go, he is often killed off.<br /><br />The epic here with room for lots of battles, magic and characters is The Saga of How House Targaryen Got the Iron Throne Back, Ensured Succession and Saved the Realms of Man for Another Thousand Years.  That's the story I thought I was getting even through AFFC, but then GRRM spent the nearly 1000 page ADWD on minutia, with only the occasional pause for brilliance.  It is wonderful to spend time with favorite characters.  Yet when the real story hasn't even begun it seems wasteful to spend so many pages on turning Cersei into Lucretia Borgia; on everybody travelling endlessly on storm-tossed seas to some destination they never reach; on characters that start out interesting and then peter away or just disappear.  Remember Robert's bastards?  Why did we even care about Edric Storm, Gendry, Mya if the legitimacy of Cersei's children will become a moot point?  Why was the promising Brienne turned into Don Quijote, totally incompetent and incapable of accomplishing any mission--and why in the name of the Seven did GRRM maim her?  That is the problem with GRRM adding character upon character.  For R'hllor's sake, finish off some minor storylines before beginning others.<br /><br />The wonder of the series for me is the world GRRM has created.  Not just the cities and people that exist now, but the mythology.  The way this family and that trace their ancestry back to the Andals or the First Men.  Passing through the sea around Valyria, still boiling and deadly centuries after the Doom, an Atlantisesque volcanic eruption(?), gave me goose-bumps.  Tyrion's journey down the river is wonderful because Tyrion appreciated the ruins of civilizations that once were and no longer are: a marvelous lesson for any would-be royal adviser.  But when Tyrion fell off the boat saving Prince Aegon, he should have drowned.  Here was a character so full of self-loathing, who committed crimes so heinous that his story arc was irredeemable: his redemption and end should have come during that amazing scene through the Palace of Sorrow, as sad as it would have been to lose him.  Instead GRRM brought him back, gave him a personality transplant and Tyrion was re-born as an oaf better suited to the grotesquerie outside the walls of Meereen than as a royal adviser.  Some characters should just stay dead.<br /><br />I like how the petty concerns of men--who sits on the Iron Throne--contrasts with the real problem--the destruction of the realms of man--that waits at the Wall.  The Wall that we learn in ADWD was once manned by Knights and is now the domain of bastards, criminals and those Dickensian children people are always trying to get rid of in novels has its own mythology spanning millennia.  When the Westerosi utter the curse \\"May the Others take him\\" (a phrase I love hearing over and over), it's because there have been no Others for 1000 years.  A thousand years! Only Jon Snow sees the implication of the wilding flight south: if they are afraid of the Others, the entire realm is in danger, which is why his character is essential to the story.  A digression:  Melisandre has turned into the Aunt Clara of the priests of R'hllor; she sees things in the fire, but darn if she doesn't misinterpret them.  So if she thinks the children of the forest are bad, they are probably good.  Heck, she asks to see AA, gets Jon, and is annoyed by the vision.  Another digression:  I like that Jon's raven repeats itself.  Ravens do that.  And it is a way to get information to Jon (and us (through Bran?)).<br /><br />I think the character of Prince Aegon is an important addition.  In the scene in the House of the Undying Ones in ACOK, Dany sees Rhaegar, who we'll come to understand was a pretty decent guy, saying to a woman nursing a baby named Aegon, \\"He has a song....  He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire.\\"  Many of us thought the woman was Lyanna and the baby Jon, but Lyanna died in childbirth after Rhaegar's death so it could never have been Jon.  The story needs Prince Aegon.  Not only because the dragon has three heads, but because if Mirri Maz Duur's curse is true, Dany will never have a living child and the story is incomplete without a succession plan for House Targaryen.  Up to this point, I had expected that the curse would be circumvented Macduff style where the baby is born dead, but comes to life after his stillbirth.  Having a second Targaryen (remember even if Jon is the third head, he is still sworn to the NW and can't become king or father legitimate children) as a compliment to Dany is a good thing.<br /><br />A word about the Stark children: they are our guides through the world of the series.  They are the small-folk whose rights get trampled when lords play the game of thrones (a phrase I hope never to see again).  Maester Aemon gave Jon some advice: kill the boy and let the man be born.  No one ever gave Robb that advice and he ended up dead as a result of his own irresponsible actions: marriage contracts should not be broken no matter how cute the girl.  I hope the remaining Stark children make it to the end of the series, but they have become witnesses and not actors (with the possible exception of Jon Snow, who might not turn out to be a Stark child after all).<br /><br />Some readers have commented that GRRM lost control of his story, ran out of drive or energy or wanted to run up the book count.  I thought that he just liked the world of the series and wanted to stay there for a while.  I understand; I have favorite characters that I like spending time with: Arya, Tyrion before his resurrection, Jon and Dany, but stories must have an end.  If it is no less than five years between books and GRRM plans at least three more, I worry one of us won't live long enough to get to the end.  GRRM has an advantage over me; he actually has an idea how the story turns out.  After reading Amazon reviews, I am worried that GRRM really has lost his way.  Otherwise, why would he have Jon, Tyrion and Varys do such stupid and uncharacteristic things for such stupid reasons?  I cut Dany some slack because she is very young and this is the first time in her life that she feels safe.<br /><br />I will wait for TWOW and hope that HBO pushes GRRM to bring it out in a respectable time frame.  I will hope that the Old Gods grant GRRM a tough editor who sets him on the correct path and that he stops maiming, humiliating, torturing and killing his good characters.  GRRM had his irresponsible would-be kings and their armies burn the fields of Westeros with Winter Coming.  People are already eating their dead--and it's only fall--so I guess my petition that he stop serving dogs, rats and the dead as entrees will go unfulfilled.  One reviewer thought that Tyrion is GRRM's alter ego---might I suggest Ramsey Snow?  I hope that the author of ADWD is reborn as the author of AGOT/ACOK/ASOS and that TWOW delights.

Please, read this talk to your children and make them aware of their own surroundings.  I highly recommend this book to mature adults.    Sincerely,      Karen Cunningham
B004EBT5CU|5.0|The music is great, but this is not why I am writing this review. I HATE that so many CDs now come without lyrics. What you get here is a number of happy Adele here and busy Adele there. Did I pay to get her pics or her music? And music in case with songs includes lyrics. None is found here.    Out of respect to those few who still buy CDs instead of downloading songs and getting pirate copies producers should include lyrics (and in readable formats, not crowded like we're running out of paper on this planet) in the booklets. It's fine if you want to throw in some pictures, but only as an added bonus.
B00005JSGK|5.0|I love this movie.  It is exactly what I expected. The scenery and the actors are just as I remembered from long ago.  It is always nice to see John Wayne in something other than westerns and war movies.
1451629184|5.0|Sort to the point. What most will come to understand is that this human being writes only what she can. Your understanding of the story will be between the lines and in your mind.  If you have never experienced the horrific treatment from a sick two legged creature such as the one she describes in her book, you may have trouble understanding it all. It is well written  and will bring real emotions to light in your heart. Bravo to Jaycee for her courage. She is a survivor !
B0053Q9DHW|2.0|As someone who has now watched every version of Jane Eyre that came to film via the big screen or TV, I was looking forward to seeing what yet another version would do with the novel to film and rented it as soon as it arrived On Demand. I was sadly disappointed. Mia plays a somewhat repressed rather than passionate Jane Eyre and Rochester is far too young, handsome and not very convincing as the hot tempered lion tamed by true love. Adele, Bertha and Grace Poole are minimally referred to. The storyline fell flat and left out numerous important scenes and details of the making of this classic.  Gone is most of Jane's important upbringing at Lowood School. Parts like the outbreak of Typhus and Jane's strong condemnation of enforced rules were completely missing. No names of the nasty Miss Scatcherd nor her beloved friend Miss Temple whose departure of the school spurns on Jane's boredom and desire to hire herself out as a governess are mentioned.  No attempt to mention St. John and his sisters are actually her cousins and why she truly wants to share her inheritance.  The scenes of Rochester courting Blanche Ingram are left out. No gypsy readings, no parlour parties, no Jane playing the piano to show her \\"schoolgirl\\" talents. Pilot the dog is referred to once!  And nothing of the famous scene where Bertha Mason comes into Jane's room, wakes her, shreds her veil and disappears in the night.  Again, a very odd and sketchy version of the story of Jane Eyre. A&E did a much better job capturing all of this in a shorter amount of filming time.  BBC did a masterpiece of the film starring Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke.  The rest fall in between. Other than some lovely gothic scenes outside and eye candy shots of the interior of an old English estate, this film lacked in every other aspect.  Even after the fire Rochester looks barely harmed and the film suddenly stops.  Where is the last chapter when the famous lines come in; \\"Reader, I married him.\\"??  Anyone new to Jane Eyre is not aware of how he regained his sight enough to see that his first child inherited his eyes.  Anyone familiar with Jane Eyre and who know the book inside out are probably cringing in their seats wondering....where is the rest of the story? Where is the full background of Bertha and how he was tricked into marrying her and what he has sacrificed?  Where is the story behind Adele and her mother?  Again, far too sketchy, which might explain why it never reached our theatres.  Plenty of better versions out there. Seek them out!
B0000025VU|4.0|Interestingly enough it wasn't until about a decade ago that I was all that AWARE of Bob Dylan's career in the 1980's. Wouldn't say it was out of any ignorance but more lack of visibility and his association with a certain time and place. Of course,having only listened to this album a couple of times and viewing it's place in his history partly via [[ASIN:B0016GLZ42 Bob Dylan: 1978-1989 - Both Ends of the Rainbow]] there's a whole new way in which I view this album. Because there are so many people out there who've decided for themselves and many others what type of music Mr. Robert Zimmerman should be making it makes me wonder if there was an intentional doubling meaning to his song \\"Gotta Serve Somebody\\". Well anyway by this album the period in which songs like that came drew to a close. Dylan's spiritual life is now...well private and he's pretty much taking a look at the environment around him in the early 80's and applying his initial style of songwriting to that climate. Of course there was a musical climate to adapt to as well. This is where he had run into trouble from listeners before. But in this case,somehow he managed to bring all these things into his orbit with the minimum of disappointment.<br /><br />  Produced by Jamaican duo Sly & Robbie,than having just completed a creating winning streak with Grace Jones managed to meld their dub/reggae rhythms with Bob's bluesy folk-rock style in a way that works best on \\"Jokerman\\",a pretty popular and beloved tune basically dealing with similar characterizations as \\"Mr.Tambourine Man\\" taken from the outlook of middle age. \\"I And I\\" is something of a later-in-the-album follow on but what's in between that really makes things interesting. Perhaps taking a cue from his recent period of making soul oriented gospel music he makes the more uptempo songs the protest numbers. \\"Neighborhood Bully\\" may generate heated debate as it singles out Israel as war mongering class enforcers but it's set to this dirty,often Stonsey guitar heavy bluesy rock. \\"Union Sundown\\" pretty much sets the same message only with a bit more of a contemporary country rock flavor to it. \\"Sweetheart Like You\\" is another of Bob's great thoughtful romantic numbers and something more of a crowd pleaser than....say \\"Licence To Kill\\",again back to the anti capitalist message \\"Man Of Peace\\",a pretty well rounded outlook on the changing nature of activism. Again \\"Don't Fall Apart On Me Tonight\\" ends the album on another romantic note.<br /><br />  Putting a very palatable style of then contemporary production,favoring glossy production over any use of electronics this album manages to present something of an early 80's version of the the folk/rock sound that he....well shocked and offended the music world with about fifteen years earlier. Although by this particular point that had become the sound people more or less expected of him. The story of Bob Dylan usually ends up being that of one person's creativity up against the expectations of those who consume the art that comes from it. By this time that whole artist versus audience seemed to be bleeding together as Bob's own artistic wishes slowly began to coincide what people seemed to expect from him. Bob Dylan's thoughts on whatever he's immersed in at any given time are always more clear headed and forward thinking than what many of his followers/fellow travelers will allow themselves to accommodate. So his music,especially during this era tends to shine a heavy spotlight on the lengths to which people who listen to will will take to adapt to his musical expansions. All the same this would be put even more to the test the next time.s enforcers but it's set to this dirty,often Stonsey guitar heavy bluesy rock. \\"Union Sundown\\" pretty much sets the same message only with a bit more of a contemporary country rock flavor to it. \\"Sweetheart Like You\\" is another of Bob's great thoughtful romantic numbers and something more of a crowd pleaser than....say \\"Licence To Kill\\",again back to the anti capitalist message \\"Man Of Peace\\",a pretty well rounded outlook on the changing nature of activism.

1451629184|5.0|Jaycee Dugard is the most brave and courageous person I have ever read about. I cried for her many times during the reading of her book. My heart goes out to her for the horror she was forced to endure at the hands of a sadistic pedophile such as Phillip Garrido. Her story, from the start to the finish was the most amazing tale to be shared with all of us and she is strong enough to have to live through it all over again in the retelling. I loved this book.
0316154687|2.0|I had the pleasure of listening to Sedaris during his debut on NPR many years ago, and his books have been at least as funny as his reading. I own all of his books, and read and reread them to myself and to friends. Except this one. It's a real disappointment.<br />It seems the author has gotten too comfortable with life. His stories aren't as funny as the ones recounted in previous books, and the only \\"keeper\\", in my opinion, is the title story.<br />I have no desire to read this to others, and don't want to loan it, figuring anyone who has heard this guy was funny will never bother to read his stuff again following exposure to it.<br />Sedaris needs to get back on drugs, work in an orchard, get chased by a drunk in a truck with a pistol. His life seems to be one of leisure, too comfortable in his relationships, living circumstances, and his pants. David, get naked again, sit on a towel, and write something meaningful. this stuff makes me want to inhale solvents. Not to enjoy, but to forget.

1936719118|5.0|This is one of the better business books I've read in awhile. Derek's approach to business is refreshing and serves as a reminder to be confident in your ideas and to set up your business the way YOU want to. While the book is more inspiring than it is full of 'how-to's' it's inspiration that hits you right in the gut. It's a quick read and will likely inspire you to create something awesome.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I laughed to the point of embarrasement. I cried a little too. And in between I fell in love with this movie. Set in Jackson, MS at the cusp of the civil rights movement, this movie delves into the lives of southern women back then. It shows the ugly reality and insidious nature of racism back in that day. But it also shows the real love and friendship between the help and the babies they raise. It also shows a glimpse of what was and was not acceptable choices for women to make with their lives back then. I loved the music, the clothing, the decor, everything seemed very acurate(according to my mother), including the racism in the south. With excellent acting and all of the above, I urge you to go see this movie!
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Just back from an Alaska cruise, and the SD card interface worked perfectly with SD cards from three different cameras (Canon and Kodak). The application that launches on the iPad (iPad 1, by the way) is a bit primitive - no bulk or group selecting available, so you have to touch each picture you want to upload; the iPad did lose track of which pictures it had uploaded already; no editing (rotate, for example) within the Photos app that launches... BUT it worked quickly and well, and I was very happy to upload a duplicate set of pictures in case anything happened to the camera or SD card.    A big bonus was being able to view the pictures on the iPad - nice size and resolution.    A bit pricey but well constructed and very useful.  I did not try the USB interface.
1451629184|5.0|This book is an easy read as far as time goes, but a difficult read as far as the heart goes.  For a woman with a fifth grade education, jaycee dugard is visually descriptive, emotionally present, and an eloquent writer.  Here is a heart wrenching look into someone's horror who has come out the other side with dignity. Well worth reading.
0321701763|3.0|This is obviously just a basic book, introducing to the tools, basic options and where panels etc are. Then you get to do very boring exercises to experiment with the tools. Don't have much to write about what was already said here.
B000V63AVY|4.0|Supertramp is a group of musicians who obviously knew how to craft some very complex pieces of music, and match them to lyrics that most pop songs don't talk about.  Most of the songs on this set are fantastic and showcase this group's obvious talent.  However, my personal favorite is The Logical Song.  The song features a simple but extremely inventive chord progression, with a very cynical set of lyrics about being jaded into thinking that the world is a crazy, chaotic, and psychotic place.  The melody, chord progression (what the background music gives us), and the lyrics are so different from what pop music usually gives us, but for some reason, it's extremely accessible, and it was a top ten single.  It's complex and creative enough to catch the attention of those who seriously study music, and has the accessibility for those that just want to hear good sturdy pop music from yesteryear.<br /><br />On top of the perk that is the MP3 album itself, another great perk is the price.  This is a very nice set of songs that you only have to shell out 7 bucks for.  This is a wonderful deal for what is probably the most comprehensive single disc set of Supertramp's hits.<br /><br />This collection is a sample of some of the pure musicianship that we don't see very often today (Not that I don't love today's music.  Trust me, I do).  Heck, it holds its own against most music from its 70s heyday, which I consider to be a very good decade for popular music.
B0000AUHPB|5.0|First of all, Amazon.com is a GREAT way to get quality items easily and quickly.  The remake of The Italian Job is a great movie that I very much enjoyed.  The original has a bit more depth.  Michael Caine rocks.  It's has a more classic feel but somehow more genuine.  Yet neither of the two will disappoint.  Some stories actually do carry over into \\"modern\\" times well.  This is certainly one of them.  But, my personal favorite is the original.  Glad I made the investment.

B000EOUSJU|5.0|There seems to be a new resurgence of interest in 1970s music, particularly among today's 15 - 25 year olds. I grew up in the 70s and my friends' teenage sons are regularly asking me for recommendations of lesser known 1970s bands. They all know about Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and the like, but they are not familiar with most of the lesser known 1970s bands.<br /><br />To assist others looking for lesser known 1970s music, I'm posting recommendations of 1970s bands and albums that aren't very well known but are worth the attention of a new generation of listeners.<br /><br />Mott The Hoople's \\"The Hoople\\", released in 1974, is one such album.<br /><br />Mott The Hoople had released several albums between 1969-1971 but didn't gain much recognition until their 1972 release,All The Young Dudes, which was produced by David Bowie. All The Young Dudes was their breakthrough album; following its release, Mott The Hoople became one of the leading British bands of the era.<br /><br />All The Young Dudes was followed in 1973 by Mott, which firmly established the band as one of the top glam bands of the day.<br /><br />After Mott was released, lead guitarist Mick Ralphs left the band to form Bad Company with former Free vocalist Paul Rogers and Free drumer Simon Kirke. Ralphs was replaced by former Spooky Tooth guitarist Luther Grosvenor, who used the stage name Ariel Bender while he was with Mott The Hoople.<br /><br />The Hoople was the last album Mott The Hoople released before frontman Ian Hunter left the band to pursue a solo career. This is a really good album. It's certainly worth having if you're exploring 1970s music. This release of The Hoople has the original album tracks along with some studio out takes and a few tracks that weren't released on the original album.<br /><br />There are three Mott The Hoople albums you should check out: All The Young Dudes, Mott and The Hoople. If you like these, you should also check out Ian Hunter's solo career. Hunter released 4 albums in the late 1970s. If you're interested in checking him out, start with his 1979 release, You're Never Alone With A Schizophrenic. If you like that one, buy his first solo album, released in 1975, titled, Ian Hunter.<br /><br />Ian Hunter is still active. He released two albums in the last five years, Shrunken heads and Man Overboard. Both are excellent.<br /><br />For those exploring 1970s music, the three Mott The Hoople studio albums released between 1972-74 -All The Young Dudes, Mott and The Hoople - are all worth your attention. There's really good material on all three albums. Don't bother with the earlier Mott The Hoople releases or the albums released after Ian Hunter left the band.<br /><br />Although Mott The Hoople is not very well known today, it was one of the leading glam rock bands during 1973-74. If you're exploring 1970s music, this album, along with All The Young Dudes, Mott and Ian Hunter's solo releases are worth your attention.ecking him out, start with his 1979 release, You're Never Alone With A Schizophrenic.

B004J4WN0I|4.0|This seemed to be a relatively good book in the fantasy gene.  I can't wait for the next book! I am really looking forward to it !
0553801473|4.0|Well, first of all let's make this clear - I'm an ASOIAF fanboy, meaning that even a 1-page leafleft saying 'Dragons R Good Buy My Books' would have warranted a purchase on my behalf.<br />Still, I feel that as a reader I can transcend such blinded admiration and make an honest critic (spoiler-free, I swear!)<br /><br />The Positive:<br />Like all books of this series, - Well written with an engaging, engrossing narrative. The book is so very hard to let go of (sleep is for stoopids).<br /><br />The Negative<br />Sloooow. Like it's predecessor, the book's different story arcs move too slowly. What could have been described in 5 chapters takes 8. That is, they are still interesting to read, but mixed is a constant growing irritation at Martin's slow pace and redundant chapters.<br /><br />Overall - a highly recommended read, prepare for some surprisingly-unpredictable (somehow that's not a contradiction with ASOIAF) plot twists, BUT keep in mind that the book has a slow, details-heavy pace that tends to over-build suspense and just be annoying.<br /><br />P.S. This is my first amazon review, and I find the 'Preview your review' button hilarious!
1400079144|5.0|Do you know when people ask you what is the best book you've ever read? I always answer 'The Lost Symbol'. Before this book being released, I've read all 4 Brown's preview books and I LIKED THEM (I didn't love, just liked). I'm much more a Child's fan than Brown's. But after reading this book, I've changed my top 1 list. The book is well written, amazing plot, fantastic history. I don't really care if the historical facts are true or not, I just like to enjoy the magic of the thriller. For instance, there is one moment that you just got stunned by the revelation of the main character!<br /><br />Really good, recommend it!
0553801473|5.0|I'm a fan of this series of books and I always find myself getting into the characters and the story. This book is no different.

0553386794|5.0|A Game of Thrones<br />As a big fan of fantasy I can't belive I never heard of \\"A Game of Thrones\\" or the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire series\\" . I see it coming on to HBO and thought I would watch this new show never knowing about the book. After I had seen the first episodes of the TV show I found it was a book. I loved the show so I thought I would get the book. WoW it didn't let me down one bit. I found the book deeper, richer, and more fun to read. I would highly recommend it to any one a fan of Epic Fantasy novels. I can't wait till I start book 2, \\"A Clash of Kings\\".
B004EQAVHI|5.0|WARNING:  This review, like 80 percent of the other reviews here, does contain spoilers.  This is a shame but the nature of this film simply requires the insertion of these spoilers in order to discuss the work.  If you want to experience the full impact of this work, DO NOT read any of these reviews, including this one, until you have finished the book.<br /><br />After all of these reviews it would be difficult for me to add anything new other than my personal opinion (and you know what they say about opinions), and the impact this work had on me while I was watching it, and indeed, the impact which remains with me.  This is not a movie which I will soon forget. I realize that tastes in reading differ widely and this is good.  Some will love this work as I did; others will despise it.  I personally feel it is one of the best works; one of the better movies, I have watched over the past few years.  But that being said, the film version of the novel is simply my cuppa and I fully realize that not everyone will share my taste...again, this is good.  If we all liked the same thing...boring!<br /><br />Now here is the first spoiler and it is a big one:  The thrust of this entire film concerns the ethics of human cloning.  This of course came to the attention of us all when Dolly the Sheep was cloned and there was much speculation as to the ethics and wisdom of human cloning.  Now it will not take the viewer very long to figure this \\"mystery\\" section of the film out even though the film has skillfully led the reader in a round about way with little hints here and there.  The viewer will very quickly realize that something is \\"just not right\\" about the situation as described.<br /><br />This story is told though the voice of Kathy H. who is currently a \\"Carer,\\" and a graduate of a very exclusive school.  Her job is to travel around England and give care to those who are in the final phase of acting their part as \\"donors.\\"  Kathy is finishing her time as a \\"Carer,\\" and is about to begin the next phase of her life.<br /><br />The story is told in a series of reminiscences as told by Kathy as she remembers her time at Hailsham, the exclusive school mentioned above.  The story centers around three primary characters, Kathy, the teller, and her two best friends, Tommy and Ruth.<br /><br />Of course the reader will eventually place all the pieces of these intricate and detailed reminiscences together and figure out that all of these children have been cloned for the express purpose of harvesting their organs...one at a time, until they die.  This is done when they become older and of age.<br /><br />Now some have classified this work as Science Fiction.  That would be an unfair assessment and could be likened to classifying `1984.' or `Brave New World,\\" as Science Fiction. No, this work falls more or less into the category of social observations...what if scenario...not really a futuristic society, but rather a society that simply is; in this day and time...speculative fiction I suppose you could call it.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that one once has the film offered the opinion of the rightness or wrongness of the situation.  It has merely laid out the story and lets the reader shudder and become rather ill when they realize what is happening and allows the viewer to come to their own conclusions.  The filming style is extremely detailed, dealing with emotions, facts and speculation and is filled with instances of digression; a method of telling the story I find extremely appealing and fits my taste in reading perfectly.  Some find this cumbersome and a bit boring...I do not.  I think the author's prose is beautiful and it is extremely thought provoking.<br /><br />I found myself becoming extremely emotional while watching this work and admit that it touched me.  Much has been written as to the fact that many feel it is unbelievable that the characters in this work can accept their fate, not make any great attempts to \\"escape\\"and accept their lot in life (for the most part) as natural.  I personally found this aspect of the work to be spot on and feel the author was making some very good points here.  All of us, in one way or another, accept social norms and accept our particular lot in life.  We like to tell ourselves differently, but for the most part it is true.  History pretty well teachers us that the majority of mankind, down through the ages, has been pretty sheep like in their obedience to social norms. Think about it.  It has happened in the past and is still happening to us today when we kid ourselves, believing that we are too smart and too sophisticated to fall into such a trap.

All of us, in one way or another, accept social norms and accept our particular lot in life.  We like to tell ourselves differently, but for the most part it is true.  History pretty well teachers us that the majority of mankind, down through the ages, has been pretty sheep like in their obedience to social norms. Think about it.  It has happened in the past and is still happening to us today when we kid ourselves, believing that we are too smart and too sophisticated to fall into such a trap.  No, for me, the premise of the story is all too believable...which sort of makes me scared and sad at the same time.    Please do not that there are not explosions, car chases, desperate and exciting scenes of escape efforts, no violence, no special effects.

0307272702|5.0|This is a great book. After reading so many other books on nutrition. \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" & \\"In Defense of Food\\" by Michael Pollan. Then \\"Catching Fire\\" by Richard Wrangham. All this info there was still something not sitting well. Gary Taubes was it. He book is very good. His info was laid out very logically. Many people may not agree with his point of view, yet what he tells us in the book has worked well for me. I would recommend starting out reading some of his articles, he is a Science Tech writer. He write allot about nutrition. So I would recommend starting there. Then when you are ready come to this book.

1451629184|5.0|This book was amazing. Jaycee was so brave to come out and write about her experience as a survivor. I like how the book was written. Jaycee would speak about an incidence and/or an experience, then talk about a reflection (of today) of how she now looks at that incidence and/or experience. I have followed this story since Jaycee went missing and who would have ever thought after 18 years she would be found. It was her own bravery that kept her alive. Shame on the authorities that let this man out of jail and those who visited his home. I would recommend reading this true story, it is very inspirational.

B004Y1USV2|1.0|Fly from here, again!. When I heard the title I knew they were going to play an old song from the 1980's tour with the buggles crew. The original recording from MSG NYC was much better. I thought the album would grow on me if I listened to it more, but that hasn't happened. The song \\"Life On A Film Set\\", when they sing \\"ride the tiger\\" I find myself screaming, MAKE IT STOP!. The album came with a DVD, I haven't watched it nor do I think I ever will. It's by far the worst Yes album that I've ever heard. I'm just so disappointed.

B000WYCF6Q|5.0|I tried a couple different mirrors on my Bacchetta Corsa Recumbent and none of them worked satisfactorily.  Most of them kept vibrating too much or were in the way when you leaned the bent against a wall or something.  This mirror is great!  I have it mounted just in front of my brake handle and I can see right over my shoulder just fine.  I put it on there, adjusted it, and haven't touched it since which was over 200 miles ago, going over some pretty rough blacktop at times.  The lens is large enough to see cars just fine in it.  Mounting is super easy with just a rubber strap. It's just inside the shifter cables so it's not in the way when leaning the bike against the wall.  I'll be getting another one sometime for the other side of my handlebars.

B00000ING2|5.0|Tim Robbins is hilarious as the clueless 1950's Midwesterner who is recruited from a New York corporate mail room of the giant Hucksucker company by bigwigs intent on devaluing (and then purchasing cheaply) their company's stock after its founder's suicide leaves a number of shares on the market.  Contrary to their expectations, Robbins' character proves to be an genius who boosts company profits by marketing iconic 1950's innovations such as the Hula Hoop.  Enter Jennifer Jason Leigh as a Katharine Hepburn-like newspaper woman who is able to exchange witty remarks with the boys at the paper while composing her copy on a typewriter.  Leigh's character sets her sights on the getting the scoop on the corporate boy genius by applying for a job as his executive secretary.  There is an especially funny scene where Leigh interviews for this job while making the absurd claim that she attended the same college in Indiana as Robbins's character.  She even goes so far as to pretend (by attempting to sing along with Robbins) that she knows the school's fight song!  Really--as if somebody who speaks Katharine Hepburn's patrician Northeast dialect could have possibly come from Indiana!  I really had a good laugh at that scene--and the many other ridiculous moments in this movie!
0345529057|5.0|As a fan of the HBO show, I started reading the books to fill the void after Season 1 of Game of Thrones ended.  The books are incredible!  George R. R. Martin is an amazing story teller who uses vivid imagery and masterful suspense to create an intricate world of fantasy, pageantry and intrigue that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I just started book #3 and I am still hooked!
0316067938|1.0|Basically, the message of this book is:  do NOT have an abortion, even if your pregnancy threatens your life, because once you give birth, you and everyone else will wind up falling in love with the child, no matter how obnoxious, selfish, irritating, and monstrous it is.  Oh yea, and even if you have no desires for motherhood, like Bella, the second you become pregnant, your protective motherly instincts will kick into overdrive.<br /><br />Utterly ridiculous garbage.  The fact that this book is an international bestseller is testament to the decline of civilization - or perhaps, to the power of marketing and packaging, or the unfortunate number of poor souls who love trash.<br /><br />There is no plot trajectory in this book, and over half of the characters are completely flat, useless, and disposable (like all the numerous members of Edward's family - whoever they are - and the many forgettable werewolves loitering around in the background like litter; not to mention the random hordes that come stampeding in at the end).  Even the main love story that's the centre of all the books is pointless.  What is Bella and Edward's love even based on?  A deep, mutual comprehension?  Shared interests?  Knowing each other better than anyone else?  Nope!  Time and time again, Bella and Edward wonder what the other is thinking.  Instead of any sort of rapport or insight, their relationship is based on Bella thinking that Edward is perfect, and Edward's macho desire to protect Bella from herself, as though she were a child.  Despite their lack of mutual understanding, they want to spend the rest of eternity (literally) together.  Smart.  (Too bad there aren't any pre-nups in vampire land, 'cause Edward is bound to lose half his wealth.)  Nevertheless, this farce of a relationship is portrayed by Meyers as the most perfect epitome of romantic love.  Barf.<br /><br />No wonder there are so many people on team Jacob - the werewolf who could read Bella's thoughts as though they were printed on her head, the one who was always there for Bella whenever Edward effed up, the one with whom Bella could laugh, share jokes, feel comfortable, and be herself.  Unfortunately, their relationship is tossed out the window in favor of yet another random, baseless (and pedophilic) relationship when Jacob too winds up falling for an irritating, fanged brat with no redeeming qualities.<br /><br />It is a miracle that I managed to read through all four books without harming myself or someone else.  These books should come with a warning label:  `CAUTION: may cause suicidal tendencies.'  Seriously, forget water boarding - give Guantanamo Bay a copy of this series.  Unfortunately, this whole thing started because I was really curious to see what all the fuss was about involving these books - well, curiosity killed the cat, as they say.  Each book just gets worse and worse, culminating in the catastrophe that is this final book.<br /><br />It is just a travesty that so many trees died to make this series - what a waste of life.  Speaking of which, unless you want to waste yours, then do NOT read this book!  However, if you find yourself unfortunate enough to be compelled to read it out of sheer masochism, then make sure you do so with a towel at the ready, to mop up all the drivel that's spilling over onto your lap.ead, the one who was always there for Bella whenever Edward effed up, the one with whom Bella could laugh, share jokes, feel comfortable, and be herself.

0767827902|1.0|I have come to the conclusion that the only reason this movie has highly rated reviews is because everyone enjoyed seeing Cybill Shepherd take her clothes off again, and again, and again......  The town in the film is dying - why? because all the smart people took off and went someplace else.  What is left in the town are complete idiots. The only bright spot was Ben Johnson - who was just as real and natural as ever. Even HE left - as his character died halfway in the film. I got a big news flash for Bogdanovich - girls in the 1950's were not amoral as they are depicted in the film. They were amoral in the 1970's (when the picture is filmed). There were a lot of future stars in this film Jeff Bridges, Timothy Bottoms (Randy Quaid was awful in this film, as usual) - and a lot of current stars (70's)(Ellen Burstyn, Eileen Brennan, Cloris Leachman)who actually carry the film....barely. I am surprised that Cybill Shepherd was able to have any kind of career after this movie. I guess it helps when your boyfriend is the director.  Good Lord, don't waste your time watching this movie - it's not worth it.
0393320928|4.0|Being the sequel to \\"Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman\\", this books contains more anecdotes of Richard Feynman's encounters with the world around him. A big part of this book is dedicated to his time in the comission to find out what happened to the Challenger space shuttle. We follow the working of this committee  from a very interesting perspective, flavoured by Mr. Feynman's sense of humour.<br /><br />A very interesting and entertaining read. If you've read \\"[[ASIN:B003V1WXKU \\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\\": Adventures of a Curious Character]]\\" and liked it, you must complete the series with this book!

B00328G4Y8|5.0|How do you write a review for the greatest rock guitarist that ever lived? Oh yea, here it is: \\"The sound quality of the CD was pretty good and the packaging was very good and when the guitar came on the earth stopped it's rotation around the sun.\\" Well actually that is a pretty accurate decription of this item-especially the last part. This album also comes with a DVD. It has Mitch Michell,(drums) Noel Redding,(Bass) and the original recording engineer for Axis. Some interesting inside info here but it would have been nice to have also included some more original footage. All in all this 17 minute DVD was a very welcome addition to an album that was never expected to include a video disk. A very nice package at an excellent price.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|The movie speaks for itself because it is a Peter Jackson film.  The quality is what is expected of a blu-ray film, and I have the two day delivery so the shipping was easy and on time.  No complaints, Thanks Amazon!
006097625X|5.0|Fantastic book. It is an enlightening and fun read. It explains the origins and psychology behind the art of comics. I am not an artist, but this book is a must read for anyone who wishes to expand his or her knowledge of comics, animation and painting.
B003JFPLCA|5.0|This is a review of the 2010 re-mastered LP of Journeyman.    I've had the pleasure of listening to this album many times and it's one of Clapton's best, in my opinion. He has a range of musical styles, from blues to rock, and some acoustic guitar too. I've listened to the remastered CD and this LP just blows it out of the water. The dynamic range and clarity of these songs is greatly improved and the soundstage is really opened, giving the music a three-dimensional quality to the point where you can pick out individual instruments and the music plays as if you have a wall of sound in front of you like a concert, as opposed to being \\"trapped\\" in front of the speakers as you get with CD. If you listen to this album on CD or even worse with little cheap earbuds via MP3, you're missing out. Eric's voice has never been so clear, and there's all kinds of little details that I haven't heard before. And for $15 shipped or so, it's a great deal. I am usually wary of remasters as the dynamic range is compromised to make the album sound louder by default since most people listen to music on little tiny speakers/headphones, but this remaster is very good and retains the warmth and dynamic range of the original analog reel-to-reel tapes.    The downside with this set is that the 2nd LP seems to be warped in these sets. I got one set and the 2nd LP played, but was noticably warped. My replacement copy was the same. It isn't a huge deal, but I find it annoying that a sealed LP can be warped like that. Both copies were packaged very well so this is a factory issue.    That being said, the LP overall is a great pressing. The cover art is great to see on a big scale with the LP jacket compared to a CD, and it's a gatefold so you get more cover art and a lyric sheet.    In short: if you like this album or Eric's work in general, get this LP!
B003ZSJ212|2.0|The thought of seeing the Original Trilogy on Blu-ray is an enticing one.  I already own the DVDs as well as the PRE-Special Edition laserdiscs.  I don't own the original movies on VHS so I don't think I have the absolute original-release versions anymore, but the laserdisc versions are probably pretty darn close.<br /><br />Truthfully, the main thing I wanted to buy this Blu-ray set for was for the bonus features on the extra discs, totaling maybe three hours of featurettes and documentaries.  But I'm confident those bonus features will end up on the Internet eventually and I'm not concerned if they are hi-def or not.<br /><br />Primarily, though, I'm sick and tired of George Lucas constantly tweaking these movies, especially the two he didn't even direct.  He's been making alterations to them for years, and it has become pretty obvious that he must never have had a clear vision for the OT or he would have settled on a \\"final cut\\" by now.  He's OCD or something, I suppose.  And the fact that he doesn't seem to have a clear vision of what he wants them to be, even after years of tinkering with them, leads us to believe that he's not such a gifted filmmaker after all.  The scripts for the prequels MORE than prove he's not a gifted writer.  He's not even a semi-competent one.  He just likes to play with his digital toys, that's all.<br /><br />I'm beginning to believe that the original Star Wars trilogy was a success IN SPITE of him and not because of him.  He certainly didn't make them alone -- he had an army of immensely talented and driven model makers, effects artists, and film editors.  They deserve at least as much credit as Lucas does for the OT.  But he took all of them out of the picture for the prequels and relied on spiffy CGI to compensate for a dull script and wooden acting.  Sorry, George, but those films just don't cut it.  No amount of bonus content can make up for how terrible those movies are.  I've taken dumps that were more interesting.<br /><br />I guess I'll just re-watch my laserdisc versions, because in those Han shoots first, there is no extra and unnecessary Mos Eisley or dewback footage, the original dialogue is mostly intact, the Sarlaac monster looks as it should, and Hayden Christenen doesn't appear in \\"....Jedi\\".<br /><br />I love the OT but not enough to shell out any more money for yet another re-worked and re-tweaked 28-34 year old \\"work in progress\\", Blu-ray or not.<br /><br />The rest of you who will buy the Blu-ray sets, enjoy them.  No doubt they will look and sound great.  But excellent movies like \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" don't need the Blu-ray treatment to be enjoyed.  A great movie transcends the viewing format.ch my laserdisc versions, because in those Han shoots first, there is no extra and unnecessary Mos Eisley or dewback footage, the original dialogue is mostly intact, the Sarlaac monster looks as it should, and Hayden Christenen doesn't appear in \\"....Jedi\\".

B004ODLUGM|5.0|I echo the previous reviewer.  We DVR'd The Gruffalo and I am very excited to not have to fast forward holiday commercials.  That said, my kids (ages 2 and 6) love to watch this and have watched it on average of once a week for 7 months now.  Unlike other kids' programming, I don't mind having it on in the background and enjoy watching it from time to time.  It is a very sweet little tale with nicely done animation, music, and calming voices.  There is also much you can talk about with both very young and older children. I highly recommend this one - appropriate for all ages and will not annoy the adults in the room.
B005CMSDLE|4.0|On first glance, Erik (Eric Bana) and Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) appear to be like any other English speaking father and daughter living alone in a remote wintery wilderness portion of the Arctic Circle while spending their time foraging for food, killing large elk, studying foreign languages, and practicing lethal martial arts.  I know, common, every day stuff.  Nothing to see here; move along.  Well, it's not that simple.  It turns out Erik is a former CIA agent with a dangerous past involving Cate Blanchett, a cucumber, handcuffs, and a power dri...er...a dangerous past that could put his daughter in grave danger.  He permits Hanna to decide when she's ready to risk life and limb to traverse the world while narrowly dodging trained assassins who run brothels and team with Agent Marissa (Blanchett), a devilishly sexy and evil agent whose business-stylish appearance and foreboding background music belie her dastardly psyche resulting from previous involvement with a secret program.  Only by accomplishing the mission given by her father will Hanna realize true freedom and uncover the revelations which caused her father to push, train, and mentor her to be a prepubescent assassin.<br /><br />Original?  Not terribly.  Plot holes?  Obvious ones.  Exciting nonetheless?  Absolutely.  Fueled by the Chemical Brothers synergistic soundtrack, tight editing that made every scene flow right over minor plot holes, and some seriously pulse-pounding action sequences, Hanna is a movie that doesn't tread new ground but I'd gladly walk the same footsteps again.
B0010X8NF0|3.0|Wes Anderson constructs an existential comedy around three brothers who (like City slickers) decide to take a ride to India and make a stop to visit their mom who lives in a Himalayan Convent.<br /><br />The initial sparkling idea ignites before the first third part of the film and what it could be a comedy of major specific weight strands, becoming a set of isolated vignettes with some laughs here and there, but the cohesion is missing.

B000RZIGVS|1.0|You know the saying... If it is too good to be true it probably is.    I bought my set a year ago on the cheap for 127.98 and recently started playing it. I did not check them to see if they played. Now that I am starting to watch them 1/3 of the disks do not work. That is a lot of bad disks. There can little doubt this is a bootleg. It is the only tv series I have ever received that has had issues, let alone this high of a failure rate.    You MUST check all your disks to make sure they play before your 30 day return window expires.    My advice is to look at the price and whether it is a new seller. Currently 6 of the lowest price sellers are 'just launched'. That is very suspicious. For more information on this topic search for 'star trek tng dvd scam' on google. There is a good article towards the top that covers this specific problem for star trek dvds.

B004P95A8E|4.0|The set is another great one from Lego.  Fun to build and very swooshable.  Slightly large compared to the old version of this ship, but a nice improvement.  The new figures are great too.  Be aware of the true list prices by checking Lego directly as well as other major retailers (except TRU).  Don't get fooled thinking you are saving a few bucks on a set when in reality the list price is simply raised.

B003CFBQBW|3.0|The only redeeming quality of the Twilight saga movies have been the soundtracks. This one is a disappointment. I didn't even like the Muse song. My main goal was to get Florence + the Machine's Heavy in Your Arms. My surprise likes were Sia's My Love and Beck/Bat for Lashes' Let's Get Lost. Jacob's Theme is very pretty but it's by composer Howard Shore so no surprise there. Hmm, as the movies are finally getting interesting, the soundtracks are slipping away.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I missed this on TV, very upset about it, but I finally found it and watched it. It was 4 hrs of pure heaven. I love how the director made it slightly erotic with the gentle caresses by Rochester. Stephens creates the sexiest portrayal of Rochester I've ever seen and Wilson is as ethereal as the fictional character she plays. I have to buy this DVD...if nothing else but to escape with my two favorite fictional characters.
B0049EJ59U|5.0|One of the best zombie miniseries ever! This is one you have to watch. I saw it first on IFC and when it was made available on Amazon I had to buy it. \\"Big Brother\\" meets \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" and the sole survivors are a group of people who couldn't get along long enough to screw in a light bulb...FANTASTIC! Well written and acted this show will have you on the edge of your seat! The special effects are what you might find in a big budget Hollywood zombie flick. Once again a foreign product has managed to nudge any domestic offering comletely out of the box (Except the Walking Dead on A&E of course). BRAVO!
B004YEJGEO|4.0|This game is amazing fun, fairly challenging, and looks great!  With 6 sectors and 20 levels per sector, it will last a while too.  It is almost perfect!  Sadly there are a few bugs (The \\"Sector\\" title not updating properly when you go to a new sector, occasionally after completing a level you will get the end screen but no menu then when you hit menu you lose the end screen, etc.) and though I feel the sectors have a decent learning curve, I did not feel like the levels within a sector were in a good order.  For example, in my opinion sector 3 level 14 was significantly more difficult than sector 3 level 17.  Even with these small draw backs, this is a great game and I highly recommend it.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|These past four episodes have all been top notch with the premiere titled, \\"Box Cutter\\" being BB's best season opener to date. Looking forward to the rest.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|What contained within this set should be the benchmark for all things horror ever to follow. Ever. The first season has a few stumbles with awkward acting between two guys who really try their best to create a brother dynamic. Then, there is an episode or two with awkward plot or poor effects. All this aside, it is hands down a solid first season. Throughout it all, the show defines the world it takes place in; we find out how the brothers came to hunt all things that go bump in the night and we also find out what tools they use for the most common jobs. Kinda of a family roadshow that really should be rated R but still kicks butt at a PG-13.<br /><br />The show really shines in its use of mythologies from around the world. A lot of the demon-talk falls into Russian and Japanese folklore, American urban legends, the wendigo are from Native American lore, and it seems they are always looking for ways to further the 'standard jobs', e.g. a hunt may start off seeming to be one thing, but the brothers later learn it's actually something else. No trope is overused however.<br /><br />The DVD set has my all time favourite special feature, never before seen - the ability to not watch the 'previously, on Supernatural' shorts. Watching Supernatural quickly becomes a daily event: get home from work, eat dinner, send the kids to bed and watch an episode or three. The pace of the storytelling gets a bit more mileage without the story so far segments. The commentaries are insightful: we hear how the car used eventually became the '67 Impalla (because it sounds like a monster), why Dean listens to a lot of 80's hair rock and Classic rock (the songs were cheaper on the production budget). Then there are the stand-bys: a few behind the scenes, deleted scenes and the like.<br /><br />The show is about family. And it seems that the cast and crew became just that during the first year of the show. The love and dedication are easily witnessed and Year One ends with such a bang that the real horror would be to not continuing to watch the show.real horror would be to not continuing to watch the show.
0553801473|1.0|We've entered Jordan County.<br /><br />If you'll look to your right you'll see a memorial to its namesake, James Oliver Rigley Jr (\\"Robert\\" to friends and fans) who like many intrepid pioneers passed away in the midst of exploring his territory, leaving others to finish.<br /><br />This excruciatingly detailed landscape includes such features as a glacial plot and a travesty of beloved characters.<br /><br />Jordan Country is pleased to welcome its newest settler, George RR Martin.<br /><br />Alright, seriously...<br /><br />I'm torn. On the one hand, I greatly admire Martin and all he's accomplished and I sympathize with the enormous challenge a series like this represents, and nobody likes a Monday morning quarterback.<br /><br />On the other hand, I feel Martin may be too close to see he's getting away from what made his series great.<br /><br />My critique can be summed up succinctly: why did this need to be written?<br /><br />From what I understand, Martin was originally going to do a break in years between SoS and the upcoming books, but realized the flashbacks and backstory would be cumbersome to recap.<br /><br />Well...what does he thing made the first three so great? All the little scenes of backstory peppered throughout! Jaime's time with the Kingsguard under Aerys, the rebellion, Littlefinger growing up with the Tullies, all wonderful, but did we need to see it all? I get the feeling this new Martin would devote whole chapters to Tyrion's marriage to Tysha, their discovery and punishment.<br /><br />Like it or not, and all those who praise Martin for breaking new ground probably won't, Martin was writing to a formula. For all the wonderful complexity the basic skeleton was a simple one: three books of setup, two or three books of payoff.<br /><br />Greg Keyes is sometimes given the backhanded compliment of Martin-light, but he has mastered the formula in all its permutations. I cite Keyes' \\"Age of Unreason\\" series, and more recently, his \\"Kingdom and Thorn and Bone\\" series the first half (two books in AoU and three in KoTaB) dedicated to causing turmoil in the world and getting all the characters in position (and having a lot of fun too) and the last installment is all payoff.<br /><br />That was the formula Martin started with, but he has wandered off the track.<br /><br />The problem is that so much of the first three books were devoted to getting certain key characters into position, but once they were in position, we don't need to see them for awhile because we know very well nothing big can happen until those dragons are grown up.<br /><br />For me, AFFC worked because none of the big characters were present, and I was fine with that. There was nothing for them to do anyway.<br /><br />For example, I would've loved to see Bran and Arya `fully formed' in their sorcerer and assassin roles, then maybe get a couple flashbacks or descriptions of their `training' days. Bran's reveal as the green-dreamin' lord of the weirwood groves could have been an incredible climax, maybe follow it up with a few brief flashbacks in the following book...<br /><br />But enough what-ifs.<br /><br />There are a lot of specific criticisms I could level, but one stands out for me at least: what is the point of Cersei getting her comeuppance now, and at the hands of some secondary characters we don't care about? In the first three books we hated Joffrey, Cersei, Jaime and Tywin. We hated them with a passion because we saw them through the eyes of their victims, and because Cersei, Joffrey and Tywin kept getting away with it. Joffrey and Tywin got away with their rotten acts right up until the end, and then we cheered when they finally died. Martin got the maximum mileage out of those two characters. With Cersei broken and reduced to an incidental character, what satisfaction are we supposed to get when Dany finally comes along to topple her regime?<br /><br />Needless to say (but like Martin I'll say it anyway) ASOIAF is no longer onmy `buy before looking' list. I don't shell out my money till I get a library copy first.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I'll cross my fingers and hope Martin can pull a U-turn and get out of Jordan Country before his epic is lost in the quagmire.my `buy before looking' list.

B002Y5FKUE|1.0|Poor Bellini! Out of fashion for a century and rescued from near obscurity by the  genius of Maria Callas only to be trashed by this horror. What are we to make of Zimmerman's absurd production? Bellini in some sort of big-city office loft, the characters, the action at total odds with the romantic bel canto score, the opera reduced to near farce. It might have been saved by superior singing but even that's missing. It's almost as though the singers were wondering to themselves: \\"What the hell is this nonsense and why are we here!\\"    Every operatic performance should be a tribute to the composer but in this case it's nothing more than an obeisance to the director and her obvious need to be seen as   daring, outrageous, and inventive. One can only shudder to think what she has in store for future opera performance (if any). Can we look forward to her Norma set in Detroit,  a metaphor for inner city collapse? I wouldn't be surprised.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I bought this book after viewing the HBO series, and even having seen most of the \\"spoilers\\" this book still did not disappoint.

1451629184|5.0|The book tells the story from a young woman's point of experience and view.  It is simply written.  I find it important that the story is told by this woman.

B004LWZW4M|4.0|Being a 5-year-old huge fan of this franchise, I couldn't wait for another sequel.    Rise of the Planet of the Apes is far superior than the last one, due to its rich detail in storytelling, acting, and sheer special ground-breaking special effects of this new type of Avatar-type apes. Brilliant!    Andy Serkis and the whole crew deserve Oscars for their acting, directing, and solid special effects. Although I liked Tim Burton's film, it didn't have the emotional impact nor the true vision that this newest one did. Mark Whalberg wasn't the right actor for that job. Needed someone with bigger acting chops. The ape actors and their make-up stole the show - hands down.    But Rise rises to all occasions, explaining just how this whole circus freak show of a franchise all started. I can't wait until its bigger, more sci-fi-ish post-apocalyptic sequel.
B004DIPL3Q|4.0|This review is to add a few observations to the general consensus, with which I agree. No one should be dissuaded from purchasing this because I give it, in effect, an A rather than an A-plus.<br /><br />Maazel lets the music speak for itself. Nothing is over-dramatized, and there were times that I missed the extra punch that some conductors (Solti & Szell, for examples) have given various phrases. The orchestra, not unexpectedly, played gloriously. Oddly, the Philharmonie Berlin was not filled to capacity for this event.<br /><br />The remainder of my comments deals with the technical quality of the audio, video, and authoring of this Blu-ray disc:<br /><br />I first have to express surprise that this 2000 performance was captured in HD--I didn't know it went back that far. I would not have been surprised if this were a film transfer since 35mm film is inherently HD, but this is a direct-to-video recording, and it is quite detailed.<br /><br />The audio, wonderful as it is, could have been better. This may be the only time I have preferred the LPCM stereo track to DTS-HD-MA, the latter adding almost nothing to a sense of space, while slightly muffling things, especially the first violins. The volume adjustments and balances in the microphone mix from the various sections of the orchestra, while too subtle to notice in themselves, had the overall effect of preventing crescendos and climaxes from reaching their full dynamic potential.<br /><br />The Blu-ray mastering is slightly botched in several ways: (1) in spite of the disc's relative austerity of features, it seems to have been authored with Java, unnecessarily slowing its load time. (2) The authoring language prevents any kind of resume capability should you turn the player off; likewise, there is no bookmarking feature, although one can resume by going to a specific chapter from the menu. Along with this, the disc provides the player with no memory of its audio setting, should one happen not to listen to all of it at once. (3) Time, chapter, and title information are not made available to the player for display either on-screen or on the device's on status window. All this makes it rather inconvenient to divide one's viewing of the 75-minute performance into shorter listening sessions; but considering that the cumulative effect is greater when hearing it all in one seating, these limitations could be considered a good thing. Certainly the audience gets few breaks in the Ring operas themselves, Das Rheingold, for instance being one 2-and-a-half-hour bladder-testing act! Better though, to give the home-theater audience a choice.<br /><br />I hope that these comments may be of interest to some and that they may somehow filter through to EuroArts, who needs to clean up their act a bit, although I must express profound appreciation to them for stepping in where DG, London, Philips, EMI, & Sony have all failed, namely in providing an adequate number of classical-music Blu-ray releases.

B0000026VF|5.0|Prisoners in Paradise is one of my favorite songs by Europe and this album by Europe which only has the album version. They still rock after debut album, they have not changed in style. This is my new favorite Europe album behind all their others. The linear notes provide all the lyrics plus thanks and a funny WARNING note! I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Europe, hair metal bands or 80's rock.
B000002LQR|4.0|I believe every album should be reviewed as if it were a blank slate with no reference to the work produced by the artist/band before or after their current release. However, given the breadth and depth of their work (nine total studio albums), RHCP makes this a near impossibility. Gearing up for their new album, \\"I'm With You\\", inspired me to  dig around and give their older material a listen, especially their most revered work \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magic\\". I was already familiar with a few of the best tracks from the album that we all know and love, but I felt like I was missing out on something special so I gave BSSM a listen in its entirety.<br /><br />Not every album/song I listen to has to change my life, and by that I mean that RHCP are notorious for nonsense/juvenile lyrics (particularly at this time) and it shows. There is a right and wrong way to do everything and I think these guys did the 'young rebellious kooky funk rock' thing right. Anthony Keidis' skills as a lyricist/vocalist are noticeably improving at this stage, as are Flea and Chad's musicianship. John Frusciante is something of a wunderkind since he has always been ahead of the curve when it comes to the guitar and songwriting, period. So on BSSM you can expect to hear their trademark funk with a preview of the maturity (both lyrically and musically) present on Californication.<br /><br />Slaphappy tracks reminiscent of their core sound that many 'true' fans reminisce (and pine) about today include: \\"Apache Rose Peacock\\", \\"Sir Psycho Sexy\\", \\"Funky Monks\\", \\"Suck My Kiss\\" and \\"Give It Away\\". Tracks that mark a noticeable transition include: \\"Under the Bridge\\", \\"Breaking the Girl\\", \\"I Could Have Lied\\", and \\"My Lovely Man\\". I love them all and, just for fun, \\"They're Red Hot\\" made me laugh out loud. The brilliant artistry cultivated on Californication (in my opinion their best work) is not present yet, but they were well on their way. In my opinion, after four attempts to 'find' themselves, BSSM is RHCP finally hitting their stride. Overall, there are albums I prefer to the renowned BSSM, but this album is still indicative of their stellar creativity and chemistry. A must have for any RHCP or alternative rock fan.ng their stride.

Dropbox is a very different application which requires a program on your computer to work and doesn't let you explore your phone's folders like this one. SwiFTP only lets you download from your phone, not send files to it like this one. Keep up the good work developer! [Motorola Triumph]

B004LAIU4I|5.0|\\"Surprise\\" was my favorite album of last decade. That this album is up to that level is not something that was a given. That it is that great again, means Paul Simon has pulled off something akin to these other previous runs- \\"Bookends\\" & \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\"...or if you prefer...\\"Hearts & Bones\\", \\"Graceland\\", & \\"Rhythm Of The Saints\\". \\"So Beautiful Or So What\\" is a rare accomplishment indeed . To say it's an eclectic batch of songs is quite an understatement, and yet at the same time he & Phil Ramone has given a unique & cohesive sound & feel to the album on a level with what he & Brian Eno achieved with \\"Surprise\\". Elvis Costello has been quoted, by rock critic Bill Flanagan (who himself said this was one of his greatest works), as saying that this was the best album released by one in the last 15 years. I'd have to say that's he might be right. The only other album in the last 15 years that I've loved this much is \\"Surprise\\" by Paul Simon, so Viva Elvis C., right on the mark.  There is simply no one, elder statesman, or newer artist, that is putting out work of this high a caliber.

But when I gave it a full test this evening, I was sorely disappointed.  It is slow and balky.  I have uninstalled it.  If you are unwilling to fork over $3 for Websharing in the Android Market, you may get by this monstrosity, but you will not be nearly as happy.      My original review follows, because it still has some useful information.      I have been using an app called Websharing for months. This app holds up to that standard. Websharing has a couple more features, so I'll keep using it. My main complaint about this app is that there is no on\/off button; when the app starts, the server starts. If you inadvertently turn the app on and you leave it set to the default no password, your phone is wide open. It would be better to have the option to turn on & off the server manually even if the app is running. Overall, tho, it is a good app and worth the price.

I would have paid $399 for a weekend workshop, learned the same information, and felt it was a great value. Sure, not everything John writes will work for me, after all it's HIS experience. But the principles he outlines and the hope he brings to his target audience (authors who want to be successful in the new world of ebooks) makes this the best deal on Amazon today. Buy it. See for yourself. I believe Amazon gives you up to a week to return it if you don't like it, and it's short enough to read in one sitting.

B000K7MMP4|5.0|This adaptation of Pride and Prejudice is the 1980 BBC miniseries,adapted by British novelist Fay Weldon and is a very faithful adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. It consists of five episodes and stars the engaging Elizabeth Garvie as Ms Elizabeth Bennet and the aristocratic-looking and handsome David Rintoul as Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy.<br /><br />This was the first adaptation of Pride and Prejudice that I watched, almost 16 years ago back when I was in college, and till today it remains one of my favorite adaptations of Austen's works, right up there with the 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice starring Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet and Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. In fact, both Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul do a very credible job portraying the lead roles.<br /><br />Although Jennifer Ehle was charming and feisty in her role in the 1995 version, Elizabeth Garvie makes a spirited Elizabeth and a very attractive, bright woman. She delivers her lines with great spirit and I was utterly charmed by her performance. Her chemistry with Mr. Darcy was also very believable, from the early days of misunderstanding and tension to the gradual growing of affection between them. David Rintoul's Darcy may not be as popular as Colin Firth's but he definitely brings a certain dignity and charm of his own to the role.<br /><br />As for the adaptation of the novel itself, the 1980 version is more faithful than the 1995 version, as it also contains about 75 extra minutes of dialogue that adds to the authentic feel of the adaptation. The rest of the casting in the 1980 adaptation was also well-done - Priscilla Morgan is hilarious as Mrs Bennet,Moray Watson is wonderful as the beleaguered Mr Bennet,Sabina Franklyn as the very beautiful and very nice Jane Bennet, Marsha Fitzalan made a very conniving Caroline Bingley and Judy Parfitt is perfect as the haughty and meddlesome Lady Catherine de Bourgh. However, I must admit that I preferred the 1995 casting with respect to the roles of Mr Collins [suitably oily], Lydia Bennet and Mr Wickham.<br /><br />What lets down this older adaptation is the poor production quality - the lighting is too dull and scenes of dancing at the balls are very uninspired with cheap looking, very small sets that don't enhance the dramatization. It's a pity for with better production values, this could have been a stellar production given that it had a great screenplay and wonderful acting.<br /><br />On the whole, I find it hard to fault this adaptation. It will always remain one of my favorite adaptations, not just of Pride and Prejudice, but of Austen's works as it is very faithful and well-cast. I recommend this to all Austen fans and also those who have only watched the 1995 adaptation and the 2005 movie version starring Keira Knightley.ily], Lydia Bennet and Mr Wickham.

B004OZOTSQ|5.0|This app is why I have amazon app store. it is a very solid utility that does something useful. the interface is a little clunky, bit it is quick and does its job well. turning the phone screen off sometimes will sever the connection, but for quick transfers this thing is great. (I use a lockscreen replacement which may be to blame for the issue.) great app!
B000EQ47HC|4.0|...it sounds like leftovers from the 1st album (Which is EXACTLY what it IS!!!) It's not bad but I think that it's not as good as it could be...There are a few gems on here but there are a few songs that definitely would have been better off either not released or put on the 1st album. This is the last album that Boston would record with the original lineup: Tom Scholz on Guitar, Barry Goudreau on Guitar, Brad Delp on Vocals, Sib Hashian on Drums, and Fran Sheehan on Bass.<br /><br />The Music:<br /><br />Don't Look Back- A nice melodic rocker to open the album. I like the guitar opening a lot<br /><br />The Journey- A nice relaxing instrumental.<br /><br />It's Easy- This is one of the tracks that could have been better unreleased or on the 1st album. Not that good IMO<br /><br />A Man I'll Never Be- Best song on the album! This is Boston at their most passionate. I think that this may be one of their best songs overall!<br /><br />Feelin' Satisfied- This song is similar to Rock n' Roll Band from the debut album, but I think this one's much better!<br /><br />Party- Just like \\"It's Easy\\"...a harder song that just fills the disc's space...<br /><br />Used to Bad News- The last good song on the album. I love this one!<br /><br />Don't Be Afraid- sounds like tracks 3 & 6...<br /><br />Verdict: If you enjoyed the 1st album and don't mind more of that sound, then get this. If you liked the first on but want something different from Boston, then get Walk On or Corporate America. If you're new to Boston, get the debut album or Walk On...both are better than this one.

B004TTZHBK|5.0|Finally a worthwhile cooking app! Easy to navigate and the cooking videos and pictures are a big help with the recipes. The format is very easy to use and works great on my galaxy tab. Only catch is that in order to watch the videos, must download an 80Mb file. Hopefully this app will be updated with more recipes. Best free app from amazon yet in my opinion.
B003H6KRIE|4.0|Chock full of extras, the Bourne trilogy is the collection to own if you like action or Matt Damon.  Smartly written with nonstop suspense, these are three of my top ten favorite action films of all time.  The Blu-ray collection is packed with the usual commentaries and deleted scenes and also contains interview and clips on what the actors went through training for this movie such as driving and an in depth look into the fight scenes.  If you've been holding out on purchasing the trilogy, this is the set you've been waiting for.
B004SB60OC|2.0|I would have given it a higher rating except that it won't play on my computer, I hate it when CDs don't play on my computer.  Come to think of it this is the second CD from atlantic recording corporation which will NOT run on my computer.  I'm sure it's an anti-piracy thing on it, which is stupid since there's ways around that still, like what happened with Norah Jones's \\"Feels Like Home\\".  Saddly all that does is make it so I can't put it on my hard drive since I don't know the ways around it.  As much as I may like and support artists so I buy their CDs, I am not paying double just so I have a digital copy.  I didn't buy it from Amazon, just thought I would put this up here as a warning.  I would have liked to know the computer issue before buying it.

030746363X|4.0|I got this book to see if I could lose 20lbs in 30 days.  I saw the author on Dr.Oz and found the whole interview facinating.  I am about to conclude my 4th week on the diet and I have lost about 8 lbs.  It has inspired me to keep on it and in time, I hope to shed 20.  I am female and not much overweight.  It was the tipping point for me to drop the weight I had gained from juicing and consuming a ton of sugar, as well as inertia.  I think it was worth it.
0811875040|5.0|My husband and I love visiting the Miette at Jack London Square for macarons and old fashioned cupcakes after the Sunday farmer's market, so I was very excited to try out these recipes in my own kitchen. Since most of the recipes call for extra small cake and tart pans, I purchased pans here on Amazon along with some other handy tools the book recommends. So far I have made the Old Fashioned cake and the Lime Tart. Both were absolutely delicious.     The recipes are a bit on the complicated side, and I think that's why I like them. It's fun to learn new techniques and to experiment in the kitchen. The results are worth the work. That being said, I now understand why the cakes cost as much as they do at the bakery: the ingredients are expensive (I used about $10 worth of cocoa and chocolate alone in the double chocolate cake), and the labor of love that goes into each batch is quite extraordinary.     There are a few errors in the book as others have pointed out, and most of them have to do with the volume to weight conversions. Since I use volume measurements instead of weight, I haven't had any issues at all. This book has inspired me to learn new baking skills and has been a joy to read and work from.
0553801473|2.0|You know its a bad book when you skip whole chapters (and I can feel safe skipping Dany chapters because she aint going anywhere) to get to the next chapter where hopefully something, anything, happens thats remotely interesting. Being interested is not an emotion you will experience in abundance with  ADWD, it is more of a long hard trawl through tedium and repetition hoping that some of the magic of the first three books will suddenly come alive.<br /><br />I guess when you have tv series on the go, conferences to attend and other books to edit, crafting a work of art falls firmly in the back seat.<br /><br />Disappointed again.  The top rated 3 star review sums up my feelings more eloquently than I ever could, just wanted to get my say in.
B00006FDCD|5.0|I think this movie is the reason I will forever be afraid of clowns!! I LOVE this movie though and believe it or not my kids wanted to watch this for Halloween so we rented it. They liked it so much they begged us to get it. It is a pretty good value, however, there are some parts that you may want to mute and close their eyes. IT is always good on Halloween and for those that are into Stephen King(we are) this is a good film of his. I would also advise ROSE RED, another great film by King.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is the first Linkin Park album I ever owned.  Their music has gotten a little weird for me in recent years, but this album is everything that drew me to the group.  It's their angry cd.  Listen to the lyrics, you'll see what I mean.  But everyone needs a little angry music every now and then.  The last song on the album, Papercut, is heartbreaking in its honesty and its beauty.  Chester (one of the lead singers) has never had formal vocal training, but I could listen to his voice all day.  This is classic Linkin Park at their genre-bending best.

1594744769|5.0|I dove into this book head first and I have yet to come up for air.  The story grabs you from the get-go with easy to read banter and interesting plot line (including actual vintage photographs that support the story) and keeps you hooked for hours.  At first sitting, I read half of the book.  One of the best reads I've had in a while (I'm generally a 10-12 book a year reader).  Buy it and love it!

0547258305|2.0|*May contain spoilers!*    This book had a great premise, that some people are born with Graces that give them extraordinary powers in a particular skill.  That's pretty much the only thing to admire about this book, though!  It was a great idea that pretty much went nowhere for 400+ pages.    I read the book because it had great reviews on the cover and I thought the idea of being Graced was very intriguing, especially when you learn the main character Katsa's Grace is for killing.  Unfortunately, the writing is really poor and the main characters, Katsa and her love interest Po, aren't believable.  Katsa's feelings about how her uncle uses her as a thug are never believable, because she's already created the Council to undermine her uncle before the book begins, but then a few chapters into the book we're supposed to feel like she's suddenly making a stand against her uncle and she doesn't want to be his thug anymore.  Similarly, Po is supposed to have a Grace where he can sense when people are thinking about him.  So how is he suddenly able to find berries in the forest in the middle of the night?  I'm sorry, but I don't think the berries are thinking about him!    I think the author's sloppy writing and characterization bring this novel down a lot.  The story dragged on for a very long time without much happening -- it could have been a lot tighter and crisper, considering that there's not even a lot of \\"showing\\" going on in the book, the author just tends to tell you what's happening -- Katsa did this.  Po did that.  Katsa felt like this.  Katsa did that.  Then the story was suddenly over very quickly.  Except it wasn't, it dragged on for another 50 pages or so.  It's clear this book is meant to be the first in a series, but it still had a very unsatisfying ending.  I can't imagine how this novel got all the good reviews it's gotten, I kept wondering if I was reading the same book as everyone else!    Sadly, I can't recommend it.  I think the writing was terrible.  I give it two stars because I thought the premise was intriguing, and I liked Po, even if the way the author wrote about his Grace was a mystery to me.
B00005AQGH|5.0|this is %100 the best album ever.. the lyrics are absolutely amazing. everything he says comes from his heart and his mind.. he knew what was going on with the world and said things that others never even thot of.. the beats are crazy good and addictive, tupac clearly had a great flow and had a way with his words and spoke with passion. not only that but he made this album in 7 DAYS!!!!! if all that isnt enough idk what is. buy this classic, EVERYBODY should.

B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I was initially concerned about the movie, because it's only two hours. I figured that there was no way they could include the level of detail in two hours that the book contained. Other adaptations had left a lot of important details out and this, I figured, would be even worse. Boy was I wrong! This movie is absolutely fantastic. I was SO happy that they really emphasized the bird theme in the novel. The wedding dress scene was perfection when Jane looked at herself and said that she was losing her name. And the film worked wonderfully to show how she didn't want to be his caged bird. I also loved how the movie began with Jane arriving at Sinjin River's house. It sucked me in and I think that the story worked so much better in film when it was shot in this manner. Perfect! The acting was perfect in this too. They embodied the characters exquisitely. My only real complaint was that they didn't really emphize Bertha's presence as much as in other adaptations. That said, I loved how that gave the whole Bertha ordeal a ghoulishness with the scene with the tapestry getting sucked into the wall. The novel shows Bertha as a kind of phantom that strolls the halls sometimes causing trouble, and this movie exaggerated that element. It was a pleasure to watch this film because even though it's short, it managed to pinpoint all of the major themes and elements of the book that are so important and that make it a literary treasure. I found myself completely engrossed in this. The roles were so well played that this was the first adaptation that made me feel the same way for the characters in the movie that I felt for the characters in the novel. Which is saying something because I'm a HUGE Jane Eyre fan. This movie is truly a treasure and I can't wait to get it when it comes out!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I did this the day it arrived. I \\"tried\\" to do it again the next day. Not happening, I am so sore I could not get past 10 minutes. I did not work out regularly before (why I can't keep up with Jillian) but I plan to now. I think I will start out with every other day until I build up a little more strength and endurance. Jillian will have you sweating away the pounds that is for sure! I am sure that if I keep this up I will lose weight. Your muscles will ache, but no pain no gain, right?!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It is so easy to read a book, love it, and over-react.  I read World War Z when it first came out (almost 5 years ago) and loved it.  I felt like I was over-reacting to a book that I enjoyed, but maybe wasn't one of the best examples of horror fiction out there.  Looking back, after a half decade of tempering my over zealous feelings towards this book, I realize that my initial thoughts may have not of been as extreme as I feared.  World War Z is a story with two main characters: a ravenous, zombie inducing virus and a struggling, yet hopeful humanity.  The whole world is kicked in the ankles when a virus nearly distinguishes human life.  But humanity, in all of its different, varied ways, fights back.  There are three reasons why this book should be considered one of the best books of the last decade.    1.  It isn't just horror fiction.  It is a conglomeration of multiple genres that amalgamate into an appealing mix.  It is sharp and at times painful, but never leaves you unsatisfied.  When you want horror, you have it.  When you need science-fiction it's there.  If your looking for drama, you'll find it.  It combines the visceral and grotesque hallmarks of zombie fiction with fast-paced action and interesting political commentary.  It isn't just standing in a long line of Romero-esque zombie horror, though it definitely delivers certain expected throwbacks to Romero's most acclaimed works.  Basically, it's a good mix.  You won't feel cheated.    2.  It's unique.  Few fiction novels choose to tell their story through the device of an \\"oral history,\\" (with Robopocalypse and Rant as notable exceptions).  Though some may find this style gimmicky, those people are probably trying to be the intelligent literary geniuses that they aren't.  It's fun.  It creates a story that could not have otherwise been told.  It is able to focus on the personal moments as well as the grand scheme at the exact same time and it forces the reader to reconcile the two.  Some have argued that this \\"style\\" prevents Brooks from doing any character development at all.  That is like saying that a bicycle is lame because it isn't good with mustard.  The point of World War Z isn't character development, though I would argue that there is definitely some of that as well.    3.  It's timely.  The last decade has forced zombies into our televisions, our books, movies, video games, and even board games.  We have seen so many, that if we happened to see one walking down the street, we probably wouldn't be all that surprised.  They are everywhere, monotonously marching into all of our media and for a while we liked it.  But eventually, it wore us down and we were ready for vampires (twilight anyone?).  It would be good to remember that this book came in the middle of a very \\"zombie decade.\\"  When its ink dried, we were begging for more zombie action and World War Z gave us much more than we asked for.        Though it may not be for everyone (little children, nursing mothers, vampire lovers), I heartily recommend this to anyone who can read.

B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Awesome app. For those who think it is not secure: here is a clue, you are using this only over your wifi network...which should be  secured by a 128 bit encryption either wpa or wep.  Furthermore, you should be using a password to access your device. Unless a hacker cracks your wifi then you are 99.99% safe. If a hacker gets into your wifi you have more problems than them getting some music files off your phone...data loggers, key loggers ect.  So read a little before you rate down an app because it is &quot;unsecure&quot;.  Great app and great that it is free today. Five stars\n\n
0307155102|5.0|I have fond memories of this book from my own childhood! They changed a few words to be more politically correct (mail carrier, etc). My son (24 mo) has loved this book for months and will spend lots of time pointing to pictures and asking for the names. I was so amazed how quickly he picked up new words and that he was able to apply them to things in real life as well as the pictures in the book. There isn't much \\"story\\" so it really encourages you to get your child talking about what is in the images, using their imagination, learning the basics of narrating stories, etc. Just a fantastic book...absolutely a classic, even for toddlers.
B00005955I|5.0|Robert Altman (1925-2006), a very productive US director, liked crowds and handled meandering and interlinked stories very well. Prêt-&agrave;-porter (1994), a  fashion show for ready-made clothes, plays in Paris, immediately following his The Player (1992) and Short Cuts (1993), both five star cases as well. Prêt-&agrave;-porter, like most of his films, is ideal for Altman's favourite technique of cameo appearances (Harry Belafonte. Paolo Bulgari. Naomi Campbell, Anello Capuano  and many more), with a host of international stars, models and designers. The film may be best known for its many cameo appearances and its final scene.<br /><br />It is quite obviously difficult to do justice to all and everybody, so the (US) National Board of Review gave its 1994 Award (\\"Best Acting by an Ensemble\\") to - all and everybody: Sophia Loren, Marcello Mastroianni, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Kim Basinger, Chiara Mastroianni, Stephen Rea, Anouk Aim&eacute;e, Rupert Everett, Rossy de Palma, Tara Leon, Georgianna Robertson, Lili Taylor, Ute Lemper,  Forest Whitaker, Tom Novembre, Richard E Grant, Anne Canovas, Julia Roberts, Tim Robbins, Lauren Bacall, Lyle Lovett, Tracey Ullman, Sally Kellerman, Linda Hunt, Teri Garr, Danny Aiello, Jean Rochefort and Michel Blanc.<br /><br />Apart from, a bit like film-in-film in Truffaut's La nuit Am&eacute;ricaine, the many fashion shows within  fashion shows add to the turbulence of the movie, it has a hilarious self-parody by Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni, which, like so much in this movie, is originally triggered by lost (actually: misplaced and later found) luggage. Labiche and slapstick rather than communication and comprehension, nutty like Jerry Lewis, but a lot more refined, I needed two viewings until I was ready for my third, where I finally got the whole story together. And had a big, long laugh. Not all Altman is five star to me, but that which is, is hall of fame quality.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|What a lovely movie!  So okay, the tale of love between brothers is unique; their attraction to each other, and their acting on that attraction would be considered by most to be at the very least socially unacceptable.  Count me among those who would typically be of that belief.    But their love unfolds before viewers in such a pure, clearly undeniable and genuine manner.  Francisco and Thomas, their story and their love for each other, aren't out to change others' lifestyles or beliefs.  They simply need and want to be together ... As children, and as men.  Their mother, and then others in their family and circle of friends and acquaintances saw and came to accept this.  As a viewer, I saw and came to accept it as well.    Francisco and Thomas belong together.

0393072231|2.0|The book mainly shows how a surprising number of people predicted the meltdown in the mortgage derivative market. It evokes some interest in the subject matter and contains some insights into a few very secondary players Eisman, Burris, and the Cornwall bunch who found interesting ways of making money from their predictions. But, what is character development in fiction or history is just gossip in a book purporting to provide financial information. For me the most interesting character was Greg Lippmann of Deutsche Bank. I didn't understand Lippmann's motives in warning on credit swaps against his own interests in selling them. That's now the subject of litigation in the case of Goldman-Sachs.    The financial instruments are better explained in one or two letters out of James Grant's compilation in 'Mr. Market Miscalculates' and probably in other sources.    Lewis fails to place blame where it belongs, on federal easy money policy starting in the mid '90s. Greed and corruption follows the money, it's an effect not the cause of a financial meltdown. Clinton's polemic dream of homeownership turned into a nightmare through excessive flow of  federal money via mortgage securitization started with federal financing of Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac along with a failure of regulation. A number of questions remain open after reading. Why did Clinton and Rubin repeal the Glass-Steagall Act? Why did they and Greenspan think that was a cause for celebration? Why did they choose to rename credit insurance as \\"swaps\\" so as not to regulate this new insurance market?    Lewis shows a few of the winners but fails to show the true losers. They were not, as Lewis implies, Wing Chau and others who bet on swaps with client's money. Lewis fails to consider the ethics involved on ether side of the bets he describes. That's apparently beyond the interest and capacity of this author who is limited to a brokers eye viewpoint. He fails to evaluate pain inflicted on the public.     The book fails to cover the role of luck in the process. Burris estimated that he was paying for  200:1 odds and actually getting 10:1. That's a very good bet, but it still requires luck to win at 10:1 odds. If the mortgage bubble had broken either earlier or later, Lewis would have had to find another set of heroes to write about.    The book doesn't draw any conclusions as to creditworthiness of large amounts of debt still entrenched in the current debt market. Nor does it say to what extent the toxic mortgage debt has been unwound to date.    Descriptions of financial mechanisms and occasional economic insights are well buried under a veil of extraneous gossip. Lack of an index spoils the book's pretensions as a finance reference. It's hard to understand the popularity of this work.
B004J4WQ46|5.0|When asked about the new Strokes album, many would say \\"Is This That?\\". This would obviously be a reference to the band's debut masterpiece; \\"Is This It?\\" The tone of the question is being geared towards Angles different styled sound. Truthfully, these people aren't really giving the band the chance it deserves. These listeners need to see the big picture. Yes, that \\"new\\" sound that the band invented back in 2001 mostly changed after Room on Fire (their second album), but many went on to write the band off immediately after the third album was released. The problem they have is the change from the old \\"signature\\" sound, to the current one. The thing of it is; this is their NEW sound - The Strokes of 2011. I ask anybody here that knows the group well; how many bands can you name that have a sound like any Strokes album? The Strokes first \\"new sounding\\" album was their third album, \\"First Impressions of Earth\\". Like Angles, it is shunned for its distance from the old Strokes sound. Think back to the early days of popular radio music, when The Beatles were the first band to truly change their sound and become even better, with their shift from poppy love songs to psychedelic music. The Beatles were going in their own direction and not really caring about what others thought. From that perspective, some of the greatest music to ever to be heard was produced. The Strokes are a band that started out with their own sound, and they continue to follow that path with every new album. Listen to the album for what it is, and for its artistic purposes of entertainment. For those of you that haven't really heard of the band or only know a few songs and want in, this album can absolutely be the first Strokes cd you own. Why? It's the music of 2011 - The Strokes of the current years. Remember, people may be some day looking back on today's music wishing it was theirs. Don't waste these albums because they define our current time and our future in music...
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|I just watched this adaptation and I have finally reached the conclusion that this book is not suited to be a 2 hour theatical movie.  The story elements are complex and to fit it into a movie format compresses it so badly that too much is lost.  The compressions in this adaptation are jarring and the real development of the characters and their relationship is rushed and lost.  For instance, the first evening of the house party in this adaptation includes the visit by Mason and subsequently, all the despair Jane feels as the house party goes on is lost.  For those of us who know the book, we fill in the blanks without thinking but it is still not very satisfying.  Rochester is played well, Jane not so much - she is a little too confused for me.  The atmosphere and cinematography are wonderful. The end while intended to be very spiritual, is abrupt.  It really isn't the film makers' fault and it certainly isn't the actors faults.  This book just does not adapt to 2 hours in any of its movie versions.  So far the best I have seen is the Dalton/Clarke version followed by the Stephens/Wilson version.  Both are at least 4 hours and even so have to leave some elements out.  People who think this book in just a love story have missed all the other elements of class, morality, sacrifice, redemption, the faces of adversity, weakness and strength etc. And these elements can not be done justice in a theatrical movie format.  Good adaptation within its limits, but I will not see it again.

B004WPYNY8|5.0|Okay, first of I have to give credit to nuclear blast as stating that this is symphony x's \\"black album\\"! Appropriately I think due to it is far more accessible I believe to more heavy metal ears, and even others. Don't get me wrong, I love symphony x with all my steel coated heart and every album too. This album is fast, powerful, and undeniably heavy friggen metal. And there are songs relaxing to the ear, chilling to the bone, and heavy on the head banging! It has something for everyone. I never find myself skipping a song from beginning to end, as I find myself listening to it in it's entirety a lot! All hail the church of the machine!

B004Y1USV2|5.0|One thing we have to have in mind is the fact that the three members of Yes are in their sixties, and we should congratulate them that they have record a new album, and are still touring like in the seventies.A lot of people complain in relation to this album, that it`s not progressive and so on. Ten years went by and no album at all, probably this could be the last yes album, so let`s keep that in mind, and for those of you who have the chance of going to see them, don`t hesitate and have fun. As the album goes, nice layers of sound, great acoustics from Steve, Benoit`s voice is very melodic, he sounds sometimes like Jon, and sometimes like Trevor Horn. Also the song into the storm sounds at least to me, like the band starcastle.I am a buggles fan as well as a Yes fan, so I give the album five stars since it`s a collaboration between them. Come on, give it a try and fly!

142314189X|5.0|If you are into mythology or have any clue on mythology this is a great series of books that set the old monsters and god's in a new age and give them a new breath of life. The series focuses on Percy and how he is challenged by god's, monster's, and titan's. During his journey he has many close calls and many times he questions himself and where he stands. During all of this his friend Grover eases him into his new life and begins his own quest. The story's bring light to most of the common monsters and god's but also includes many of the others that are slightly harder to find in the old story's. So anyone wanting a good set of books to read shouldn't look to much farther than these.

0679805273|5.0|When I graduated from high school one of my friends gave me this book and everyone signed it to congratulate me on my big achievement.  I have loved this book ever since.  It is a typical Seuss book full of words that don't make sense and pictures that are fun to look at because they are so colorful.<br />I love this book so much because it didn't just tell me how wonderful everything was going to be, it said there were going to be hard times and lonely times and times that I'll want to forget.  Life is full of bumps and hills but if we know who we are and how \\"brainy\\" we are we can go as far as we want.<br />I was teaching at a junior college for a few years and at the end of every semester there were always days that were slower and less demanding than others, on those days I would read this book to my classes.  I read this book to every single one of my classes.  At first they all thought I was nuts for bringing in a kids book to read to these adults.  When I finished the book I had them write a paragraph response to it.  Obviously I got all kinds of responses like \\"I knew you were crazy but reading a kids book to us proves it\\"  But I also received some very deep and thoughtful answers on how the students were amazed at how the book really related to them and how they wanted a copy now to add to their collections.<br />This is a book for all ages and all situations, whether you are flying high above the rest or you're in the waiting place.  I would recommend it to anyone!

B004EPYZP8|5.0|The Lincoln Lawyer is a faithful adaptation of the Michael Connelly novel.  Great story and terrific acting.  This was the role that Matthew McConaughey was meant to play.  Hope there is a series of Mickey Haller films.
