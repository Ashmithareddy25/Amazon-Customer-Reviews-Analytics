B003IEJZUG|5.0|Great read. Being a fan of NGC and Discovery does make me very biased towards animal/adventure stories in the first place but irrespective of that, a very well written book. The novel is not just about animals/adventure though, but a lot lot more which I shouldn't reveal. I'd definitely recommend it.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|So much is going on in this film that you must watch it repeatedly. Funny, heartwarming, beautifully done.  Loved the accents!!!
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|I gave this movie one star because it sucks. The story is weak and disjointed, the graphics are subpar for this type of movie and the movie is just plain stupid (even for this type of movie). I rented this movie because my teenagers thought it might be cool to watch since they were fans of the first couple of movies in the series. Even they thought it sucked. I do not recommend.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I had downloade it to my Kindle Fire and thought it would come in handy for Gmail.  Only I couldn't get to g-mail from it I actually had to remove it and now just use it as a search when I need to look up something.
B008AT71WI|5.0|I originally saw LSoH on stage at the San Diego Rep in 1986 and fell in love with it. I was SO excited when the movie was released that I stood in line for I've an hour on opening night. It was absolutely perfect (well almost - they cut several songs, but I'm used to that with film adaptations of musicals) until they got to the end when I said WTF? They changed it... Many years later I heard the story of the original ending and how/why it was changed. Some years back I \\"lucked out\\" and got the DVD version that had the BW \\"working copy\\"'of the original ending as a \\"special feature\\". It was better than nothing, but still not really satisfying. But now, with this release we FINALLY can see the movie as originally intended. The restoration is flawless, and the final footage is amazing; a year of model building and several months of shooting can finally come to light. This release is a MUST for lovers of the movie. And even if all you watch is the theatrical release version (with the \\"happy\\" ending), the technical quality of the high def transfer make this worth while. Cannot recommend it highly enough!

0525953590|5.0|The topic matter is complex but the writer's clarity and skill make the subject seems less so.  It is not a quick read for most people but it is understandable if you take the time.  The book gives a good review of the functioning of the collider.  The book is well written and I highly recommend to those interested in the subject.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|My 5 year old thought it was okay...for about 15 minutes and then she was done with it.  I didn't want to pay for the enhanced features for this app so I can't really say if it is something amazing or just a mediocre game for kids.

B000VYX8PE|5.0|Lemony is such fun  I visited his web page and and recommend it.  Genius. I'm convinced his humor is definitely wasted on children,  He reminds me of my favorite uncle Cecil who could make a mystery of anything.  But, he always explained the big words so I would feel as smart as him.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Excellent movies for those who like drama, suspense, and intrigue.  Awesome that all three came together.  Highly recommend.  Great gift.

B005USZML4|5.0|Read any John Grisham book I can find and have never read one I didn't like. He is a great author and all his books hold my attention very well. This book didn't disappoint me. The characters and their relationships were intriguing and made the book very interesting. Theo is a very smart and respectful young man who is loyal to his friends and respectful to the court officials. I enjoy him in every  book I've read.

B008J34466|4.0|it took me a few listens to respond to this album, hard to follow on from the killer last one, but this is a really good effort. Some songs sound like rejects from the last album but there are some real gems on the album :) recommended.
B00992CF6W|5.0|amazing that we finally are able to have it in our phones and kindles and get updates every month or two! i dont like it when people compare this to the pc and xbox versions because this was where they were before, and it took FOREVER to get where they are today. So everyones just being impatient, and dont know how long coding for different devices actually takes. im glad they are taking minecraft to portable though. it waste free time. :)

B007TUAHVQ|1.0|I am so disappointed in it, there are more than 40 missing parts in this set. I spent an hour help my 7 year old boy to checked with all the parts. I'm shipping it straight out to get my refund back. I also tried to call Megablocks customer service, but never be able to get a hold to anybody. VERY FRUSTRATED!!!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Django Unchained might be the best movie I've seen all year, behind Lincoln, of course.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx is superb as Django, a slave purchased by Dr. King Schultz (Christophe Waltz) who receives his freedom in exchange for assistance with bounty hunting. Django sets off with Dr. Schultz to murder wanted men and cash in on the bodies (such is bounty hunting). Of course, the time being 1858, 2 years before the Civil War in the South, there had to be some form of KKK around. In this case, nothing was funnier than watching Don Johnson and Jonah Hill try to ride around with sheets on their heads that they couldn't even see out of. That was the only humor I could find regarding the KKK, which I am grateful for. After of course killing Don Johnson's Colonel Sanders-looking slave owner, the two set off on a mission for the bounties that await.<br /><br />After bounty hunting all winter, Django and Dr. Schultz set off for Greenville, Mississippi in search of Django's wife, Broomhilda, who had been sold to Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio in his best role yet). They set off to find her and to charm Mr. Candie into selling her to them. Samuel L. Jackson is Mr. Candie's house slave, head of the house. He has a big problem with Django being on a horse and being treated like white folk. He finds out that Broomhilda and Django are married and informs Mr. Candie that he is being swindled. Mr. Candie sells Broomhilda to Dr. Schultz but demands that Dr. Schultz shake his hand or the sale is not valid per Southern custom. Dr. Schultz kills him and then the great shootout ensues.<br /><br />Long story short, Django rescues Broomhilda, there's a gruesome redneck bloodbath at the hands of Django and he rides off with his wife.<br /><br />Lots of humor and the brutality of slave ownership was personified in this movie. I had only read the horror stories about slave treatment in books like Huckleberry Finn and Gone with the Wind, but never seen it on screen before. The harsh realityof the treatment of slaves like cattle and property by the rich plantation owners was brought to life. Leonardo DiCaprio truly was evil here. The moviegoing public is used to seeing him in films like Titanic and Blood Diamond, but never as brutal as the plantation owner. He was wonderfully cast and in my opinion, deserves an Oscar win for his performance. Dirty and slimy yet unhinged was the way to go here for Mr. Candie. The \\"hot box\\" scene was particularly gross, especially upon learning that a black man, Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) ordered and carried out the punishment himself. Throwing Broomhilda into the hot box naked on a really hot Mississippi day was just nasty. Then of course the slave being ripped apart and eaten by rabid dogs was no picnic. The scene was reminiscent of Jezebel being torn apart by dogs in the Bible. The dogs were starved and greedily fed on the poor slave. That is one part of American history I wish had never happened.<br /><br />Overall, the movie was great. Lots of dialogue, as is Quentin Tarantino's style, mixed in with surprising acts of violence and notable cameos by Bruce Dern and Russ Tamblyn. Not a movie for the kids. I wouldn't allow my 15 year old sister to see it either. I cringed and squirmed during the torture scenes and I can handle some pretty violent gruesome stuff, but seeing the horrors of slavery was too real for me I guess. I am going to buy this movie when it comes out on Blu Ray . Lots of humor and Jamie Foxx was at his best, after Ray.

B009JBZH54|5.0|Three of my favorite movies. No reason not to own them on BluRay. I kind of wish they came with DVD copies as well but you can't win it all. Definitely worth it for the price.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I first decided to read this book I thought I would just read it every now and then, boy was I wrong.I'll keep this short. I couldn't put it down! My wife even yelled at me because I was so into it. Excellent book. I would recommend to friends.
B008JFC6F0|3.0|Tame Impala continues in the same vein as their strong first album, with swirly psychedelic riff-based rock and vocals reminiscent of a young John Lennon. Some of it's great, but after several songs it all kind of bleeds together into a trippy blur.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|Love this show!!!! Loved the deleted scenes and gag reel too :) wish the music was the same as it was when it originally aired, but no big deal there!!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I lucked out on this and got if for free.  I played [[ASIN:B008GU42KK Call of Atlantis]] which is the free teaser version and liked it but was unsure of paying $5 for it.  My patience paid off and this was free one day so I got it.  I beat it in two days (have to work) and enjoyed it.  There's a mixture of Match three and finding things similar to [[ASIN:B007V5CF5K Snark Busters: Welcome to the Club]] but it is a little different.<br /><br />My thought is that if you liked Snark Busters you'll like this game but wait for a freebie or sale; I'm not sure it's worth $5.
B007SSDS24|1.0|Special effects were the only redeeming part of this movie. Very boring story, terrible acting, terrible ending. Not worth renting.
0618871713|4.0|Many other students in my College Graphic Novel course did not like this read, however I found it very profound and deep. It's hard to get into because of all the ambiguous issues and other literature that is incorporated in conversation. It's still a great work and definitely worthwhile.

B008XBASVY|5.0|This book is amazing. One of the best books I've ever read. It makes you cry and laugh. You go through a whole range of feelings that...I can't even describe it. You need to read it for yourself.
B006VGGAC4|4.0|I have been a fan of Arnold since I was a child.  I got into weightlifting when I was in high school, and still have my hardcover copy of the Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding.  I have followed his career, been a fan of his movies, and read several books about him.  I liked this book because it is one of the few that goes into details about his childhood through this arrival in America.  Several things I had heard and read were not accurate, and he tells the story himself.  I enjoyed the book for the most part, but his recall of his performance and accomplishment as Governor of Calif.  are pretty subjective and I believe inflated from his point of view.  I live in Calif, and I voted for Arnold twice.  However, a Republican Governor in Calif if pretty much lame duck from day one in normal circumstances.  Arnold did try to change that, but it did not work out that way.  The really interesting stuff in the book really involves his early life, his rise to the top, working on various movies, and his business dealings.  The political stuff if pretty subjective and somewhat inflated, and the recent family turmoil and child out of wedlock is not a significant portion of the book.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this game! great storyline, long enough to play and not to scary but wouldn't let my 7 year old play it :) good job guys now sequel me please.

B009KHDT0C|5.0|I really like Johnny Depp.  He can do about any role.  This was a tongue in cheek movie that is very entertaining from start to finish.  Depp does an amazing job, and the cast is well suited for this movie.
B008NEVPCC|5.0|I like Cher though it doesn't have that many songs on it. I love the single being played and her voice but she does try to rap blehhh no british rappers no!!
B0018BB20W|4.0|I first purchased this album in 1969 on 8 track tape.  Yup, dinosaurs had 8 tracks. Anyway, I used to sit in my car and listen to this for hours.  As I remember, Moody Blues was the first POP band to include a full orchestra while recording.  After so many years of the Beatles et al, and 4 piece bands (drums, guitars and keyboard), it was great to listen to the Moody Blues.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|Masterful storytelling, videography, costuming and character development. A classic for all time, as we have come to expect from Masterpiece works.
B006TVQTHW|5.0|One of the best cases ever. Front jacks, strong case integrity, the inside is good and well spaced for SSDs and other things too. Good back side for wiring, and has good fan ports.<br /><br />Only bad thing is that i hear the front mic jack, has sound issues with Skype. They could hear what i am watching on Youtube and etc. I hear its some wire shielding thing, can be fixed on your own. Its not a big deal.
B0067TGSOK|4.0|This is not only a pragmatic but also a &#34;first-hand&#34; account of someone who makes you think and open your mind to many possibilities.  Regardless whether or not one starts their own business I would highly recommend it as a book full of great examples and new perspectives
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|This soundtrack was recorded on-set as the actors portrayed their characters in-scene, rather than in a sound studio.  The result is less polished, but truly emotive.  Powerful emotions drive many of the songs.

B003UESJIS|4.0|Much has been written about this film already and I will try not to retrace ground already covered. It is not a film for those who want tidy endings or a formulaic sequence of feel-good moments. Those negative reviewers who say they hate it are perhaps telling us more about themselves than about the film. But I will grant that it takes a certain perspective to appreciate all that is going on in this beautifully crafted work of art.<br /><br />I came to the reviews to find out what others thought of the film because I was deeply moved by it. Now, I am close in age to many of the main characters, and can relate in some way to all of them, so maybe that is part of the reason it hit me so hard. Whatever the reasons, I gained real insight about human development, the root of loneliness, and the components of contentment.<br /><br />Gerri and Tom are beautiful people who radiate an almost saintly magnetism but with all the traits of real people. Can we hope to achieve their level of maturity? You can watch the film just to enjoy their resonant calm.<br /><br />The tension in the movie is created by the various wounded individuals who come and go, particularly the central character Mary. Lesley Manville's portrayal of Mary is impressively achingly believable. The changes in this character from the beginning of the film to the end are subtle and rich. With seemingly only the movement of her eyes and turn of her mouth we feel how deeply she is descending into grief about all the possibilities that have slipped away. As other reviewers have noted, Mary is by turns self-absorbed, flawed, deluded, and desperate, but lovable at the end in her epiphany and continued hope in the wrong things (i.e. a romance).<br /><br />When Gerri, towards the end of the film, tells Mary she needs to talk to a professional, we see how resistant the psyche can be to admitting it's own troubles. We see how hard it is to shift out of old patterns of thought and longing, how hard it is to wake up to who we really are.<br /><br />As a viewer I wanted to tell Mary to just relax, to take stock of what she had going for her, to spend some time developing and appreciating herself. But the bright sparks of fortune she has in her life seem to dwindle under the darkness of mortality and her fear of loneliness.<br /><br />There is a complex \\"message\\" in the film. Something to do with facing what is, thinking of others, and generally growing up. The story's fabric contains sub-threads about social skills, the advantages of intelligence/education, and how we get stuck.<br /><br />Mary's \\"style\\" of interacting with others is similar to Joe's girlfriend Katie's style (both extroverted and lively), but while both are interestingly animated, Mary's escalates to a manic level before crashing. Part of the attraction of the film is trying to figure out what makes Katie's style work so well, while Mary's overloads the nerves. Are we looking at the same basic person in different contexts?<br /><br />I have not seen other films by Mike Leigh, but if this one is anything to go on, I have some enjoyable viewing ahead of me!ho we really are.<br /><br />As a viewer I wanted to tell Mary to just relax, to take stock of what she had going for her, to spend some time developing and appreciating herself.

B001C4Z6SY|5.0|Best production and the music from on a island was awesome, the historical event arena also gave a sense of purpose to he concert.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Honestly this is the best book I read in a very long time. I couldn't put my kindle down because I had to see what was going to happen next. I recently seen the movie and usually if i see the movie before, I won't read the book but I just had to read this. I wish I had this book my freshman year because it would have helped. Even though I didn't have it as bad a Charlie, thinking back on the time, it wasn't that different. Being now 17 and a junior in high school, I'm amazed that Charlie experienced all he did and was able to stay strong, even though he thought about suicide, he knew it wasn't right, and it would only hurt his family more. This book was amazing and Charlie is my inspiration and I would read this book 20 more times just because.
B000UD08HW|2.0|Live at Gdansk is a much better production, the eliance on Dark Side of the Moon reflects alack of innovation att for the original PF repertoire

B0094BB4TW|2.0|I can get more posts on my phone then I can get on the kindle. I can scroll forever on my phone and keep reading posts. I only get a handful of posts on the kindle fire. Very disappointed. I looked for a setting to change but it isn't a setting that I can find. Maybe if I can find the setting I'll change my review but not until then.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|this product is solid and comes with instructions for install, it serves its purpose and is working well for me.
B005F8CL1S|5.0|I'll review the box, as so many others have and are much better at reviewing the music.  Every studio album, except Old Ideas, is represented here.  Individual thin paper cases, which I assume are meant to resemble the original vinyl LPs, house the discs, Very nice.  Box contains a separate bit of literature with corresponding lyrics.  My impression of the set was that, if Mr. Cohen were to give his life's work to a cherished friend in the form of CDs, this is what he would hand them.  I purchased this for about $36 dollars, and am not disappointed.

B000I8ERVC|4.0|The movie is obviously worth 5 stars any day, but I am biased because I love it. A star, almost two, were deducted because Amazon's streaming is not up to par with Netflix or even YouTube (but there are no ads! but that should be expected as a consumer...)
B007J4T2G8|2.0|A little over the top for my taste,but my daughter said to keep reading the next books and will feel better about him.

B00APUQRPC|3.0|The movie itself was good. However I signed up for a dark comedy and ended up with a romantic comedy.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|My husband is really enjoying this set. I have not seen anything else on TV besides West Wing since Christmas Day!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can't wait to purchase the last book!! A real page turner to say the least! The suspense, the drama is awe-inspiring!
B003P9VZ0W|4.0|Pros :<br /><br />1&#62; Can be repositioned multiple times .<br />2&#62; Good quality<br /><br />Cons :<br /><br />1&#62; Starts to come off the wall after sometime  and needs to be pasted again .
B009NPKTN6|4.0|Love the movie its supper funny and on with the times love all the actors and all the music its a blast for all
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love this show, I watch it all the time . Jim Parsons is the character that I love the most.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Great game, need to think about what your doing but can be frustrating at times. A good challenge and long play time. Make sure you look up a walk through  beforehand.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Loved the soundtrack, but I would give it 5 stars if they included &#34;Look Down&#34; (the second time they sang it), the full &#34;Do You Hear the People Sing&#34; and &#34;Little People&#34;.
B0063IH60K|1.0|. I had ordered Solitaire, angry birde, weather, double3 down casino,country gospel,text now, and live at brushy mt pennitenary and due to a malfunction on my Kindle I had to return it to best buy and they are sending me another one so these are all worthless at this point to me.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|I bought this app for my three year old daughter, and she loves it. Played it longer then any other app. Lots off different things for her to do. Can't wait to see how some of the other Dr. PANDA apps are.
B00846REIS|4.0|Good read a lot like 50 shades. Have to get the rest. Want to find out what happens. Thank you
B00979CS50|5.0|Went to his concert in Ontario, Canada and the best way to describe it was watching an icon perform.  Great music
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|I thought this was a good book, the best of the entire series. I'm such a big fan of diary of a wimpy kid. I also recommend big nate.
1419705849|4.0|Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a Good book, made  a great Christmas present..Best price I have found anywhere..thanks Amazon..
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Definitely worth the read.  Not a cliff hanger but leaves you wanting more. Just finished and already downloaded the 2nd.
0345803485|1.0|Thought I would have a look at this book because of all the hype... read the first 100 pages and then I couldn't control my gag reflex any longer.  When I write a review, I try to come up with at least one point that is positive in order to rate at least one star.  This reads as if it was written by some teenager. The characters are about as substantial is single ply toilet tissue.  The story line is emaciated.  The smattering of erotica is ... fine - there it is!  The reason for one star!.<br /><br />The level of hype that this book has received makes me wonder about the overall maturity of the audience out there... scary.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Whoever hasn't read this book doesn't know the meaning of true pain. Now I'm off to find the third one!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved it just needs more romance and they should have gotten pregnant and had the baby. happily ever after! Yay
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I truly LOVE Facebook!! I keep up with family and friends thru Facebook. I LOVE the pictures and all of the day to day happenings that you would never know without it!!!
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|Restless is a beautifully written, riveting story. You have to pay attention to catch all the details, and it's well worth it.
B009EAALEW|2.0|Being a huge CI fan, and loving his Beyond The Sun CD set, I was really looking forward to this DVD of the Beyond The Sun concert.  But this isn't it.  This is a very badly put together DVD.  No opening credits, it is filmed on 3 different stages, there is only about 2 songs from the Beyond the Sun album, and the rest are the traditional CI favorites filmed and released for about the 5th time.  The crowd shots are endless, and rather sad to see that CI's fan base now consists of 40+ year olds looking for a early night so they can get home before the baby sitter's go into golden time.  On the music side, the band is as great as ever, the performances first rate!  It's just the song selection, and billing the disk as Beyond The Sun Live is certainly misleading.  Leave this one alone.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|With boost in writing, better Snow casting, and more of a twist on the classic tale, this would have been a great movie. Charlize Theron is worth seeing though.
0425263916|4.0|good book , can not wait for the next one to come out, so i can read the rest of the story
B0090X4GLW|5.0|If you like the movie, the soundtrack is a must have.  Not everyone appreciates acapella music, but the enthusiast will love this and you will be singing along from the first play!
B0041KVZ18|4.0|The album is not too bad. It plays with no problems, though there was a skipping back on Revolution 9, probably a speck of dirt that was not heard during second playing. Other than that the LP's play fine and sound fine.<br /><br />Too bad the album cover was not a top loader as was the original UK pressings. Rainbo and EMI apparently didn't feel the need to be quite as accurate as they claim they would. The enclosed pictures are okay, but not near as glossy as from the original album. The same is said for the poster. I say these things as I compared this reissue with the original, which I own. As has been stated before, there are not replicas. Knowing that going in, that these are not from the master tapes and that the album covers and other inserts that may come with them, then you should have no problem with them. Well, outside of the various, and seemingly endless slew of complaints about Rainbo's less than stellar pressings.<br /><br />This copy of the White Album is okay, but my Sgt, Pepper's is being returned due to static running through the whole album. So I am experiencing the pressing problems, too. My copies of Revolver and Let It Be are fine, though. These are all that I have purchased so far. Maybe I may pick up one now and then, but I am more anxious about the upcoming mono set.<br /><br />Generally a review should be of the music, and we all know that the Beatles catalog is the standard as far as music is concerned, but it is also fair in this case to address the concerns that so many have with these pressings.<br /><br />Hopefully the mono set will be better. I was reading about Quality Record Pressing, supposedly the finest record pressing plant in the world right now. Why not go with a company that touts itself as pressing the finest records in the world?
B009I2UH2W|5.0|I recently purchased a new Apple product and was hard pressed to find a new car charger with the 8 pin connector. I only found cheap aftermarket products going a liitle as $5 on auction sites, which some reviews said would not properly charge your phone or give an error message saying that the charger was incompatible with the new 8 pin connector. I was happy to find this by Griffin Tech just in time for my trip out of town over the Christmas holiday. The charger quickly charges my phone and even the ring around the head of the charger lights up which I found to be kinda cool. It's fits snug into my car 12v socket, insuring me of a good charge. It's well worth the price too.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The definitive version of Avatar.  Unfortunately it took them a while to come out with this release.... this is the copy that should have been released the the blu-rays first came out but unfortunately the companies need to milk us for every cent.<br /><br />Anyways, this is a must have for all 3d tv owners.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Exelent,,, it arrived as described and came in time with no mayor problems and the quality of the DVDs are good
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great movie! Has all the features to be expected.  If you have a 3d tv might as well get the full package.
B005FPT51K|4.0|Honestly not sure what all of these complaints are about.  I have had this almost 9 months after getting it as a gift an it's been great!  Contrary to some rumors it DOES work over 3G in fact it warns you the connection may be slower since your not on local network.<br />My unit has worked like a charm and the infrared is phenomenal.  No complaints here.
0300169787|5.0|Great product, price is amazing and delivered on time as promised.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|The kids are 3 and 5 and both are very much enthralled by the movie. It is a good family movie and i liked it
B0063IH60K|2.0|Game play was good. Ads between each game, annoying but acceptable. Ads that keep crashing the program and my device unacceptable. Uninstalled.
B000067QMD|5.0|They do what is intended and it's nice to have spares around the house just in case one is lost.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I really enjoy playing Mahjong. This is a very good game, easy to control and lots of different designs. However, sometimes the game freezes up and I have to go back to my home screen and try again. Luckily it doesn't freeze up my Kindle Fire!
B001AQO3WY|5.0|Awesome mocumentary type series exploring modern warfare and the soldiers who fight it. Would recommend this show to anyone who likes war movies (keep in mind that this one isn't very who-ra! Merica is the best kind of film). It touches on what goes through soldiers minds as to whether they should even be fighting the war they are in. Wish they had kept making this movie but apparently it wasn't so popular in the U.S.... I can see why.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This is a great game, lots of levels. My girls, 10 & 8, are always stealing my kindle fire and playing it!
B002HML6Y8|5.0|I viewed the movie a few minutes ago. Excellent art work. The story and the plot were not the usual run of the mill. It was not predictable. The acting was great. The background music fit the movie, and it was exactly the right volume. Too many movies have the music turned up so loud that the actor's words can not be discerned. The story was entertaining, humorous and crafty at the same time. It was just plain fun to watch. It had werewolves, Vampires, Dracula, Frankenstein, adventure, and the beautiful Kate Beckinsale with her swords and leather. I'm hard to please, so when I say it is a great movie, it is. The super low price at Amazon makes this movie a must-buy.
B009O2XY12|4.0|This is a fun game. Easy to figure out and very addictive! If you like games like this...get it today!
B007S3S8HO|1.0|40 minutes to build, 1 second to destroy it all. The instructions are poor, the pieces do not click into place, and it falls apart if you breathe on it.<br />I am throwing the blocks out & the kids can just use the birds & pigs in other places.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|If you like Angry birds, you will love this app. So many different levels. My girls, 10 & 8, are always stealing my Kindle Fire and playing it!!
0374533571|3.0|I bought this book after seeing the movie trailers. I thought it would be quick,clever and funny. I was disappointed.<br />The author struggled ...the characters struggled and all in all it seemed a bit sad.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is really cute. I actually downloaded it for my daughters, 10 & 8, however I HAD to try it out for myself :) I really enjoyed it and it has all the little animals that the wii game has. It's free for my Kindle Fire and well worth it!! :)
0385536828|4.0|As usual Ian writes a good read. The characters were well drawn. The plot was believable. The dialogue was superb, as usual.<br />This man is simply a first rate story teller.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I think that it would be ok for little kids, but not really for anyone else. I don't love love love it, but I would like it if I were crazy for the show.
B005LAII08|5.0|We bought this movie without even seeing it and we are glad we did.  The 3D is great and our whole family loves it.
B000W21ER4|5.0|I really like this cd and i can listen to it from start to finish..  The price couldn't be beat either.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I was a fun movie, well done. No...it wasn't historically accurate film that portrayed Lincoln accurately but then again it wasn't supposed to be, after all  its a vampire spoof and it was worth watching.
B0081SPK0I|4.0|This is a fun game for a beginner. Plus it was free. I do not have any other speed games
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|&#60;3 I love Ellie Goulding. There is 3-4 Awesome tracks on this album. The rest are pretty good. She is suck an amazing singer. She has a very unique voice for sure. &#60;3
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Every woman wants to be worth the pursuit--that is this book.  It is a nice, feel good novel.  Typical to Sparks, it is well written and interesting; somewhat predictable, but then, you want that!
1878424319|5.0|For my wife.  She says it is a good book.  I will take her word for it.  I don't read motivational books.  I get my motivation from television.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I was hooked the second I started it.  Just wish it was longer.  Very entertaining with a creative story line. I very much liked the  fun puzzles to help slove the mystery.
159420411X|5.0|I had the idea this would be about something different, but the book is so well written that it engaged my interest anyway and I have very much enjoyed reading it.  It has opened a whole new world to me.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|I loved that book. It talks about a very dynamic period in history of Saxon England. Language is very expressive. Plot is intriguing and keeps reader guessing about what is going to happen next.<br /><br />It would be great, if book had an appendix with phonetic spelling of Saxon names. I could only guess how Saxon names, spelled in Saxon script, should sound.
145162445X|3.0|This book deals with more with astro physics. It looks like the author is taking lot of pains to prove that there is no God.<br />After detailed discussion on cosmology, he jumps to the statemen that there is no god. HE IS NOT PROVING IT. iN MY OPINION NO BODY CAN EVER 'PROVE IT'.
0525953728|4.0|At first the book was dragging on for me with stories of other missions and training etc. but I figured I was being inpatient, wanting to get to the raid already.  Overalll it was very good, descriptive and one of those books you dont want to put down. Glad to have a big piece of American history under my belt.
0307887960|4.0|My hubby lost 130 pounds over a year on this plan. He gained back about 20. Not bad. I couldn't do the program....made me sick. We've referred others to the plan and they, too, have had success. Not sure I would recommend it long term to anyone.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Poorly written, old fashioned language for the year it was written.  Ending was an unfinished letdown.  Could have been a beautiful love story, but there were so many missed opportunities.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|I love this case it keeps things well protected. Its easy to use and easy to put onto your Kindle.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved this series.  Don't ever write reviews so but was moved to write this one.  Every book kept me on the edge of my seat.  Really enjoyed all the characters.  Hope there is more to come.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great book read it I read it and loved it so you should too l, I've always been a fan of Jeff Kinney
0399157565|5.0|Not the best but still very good.  It took a lot of concentration to follow the story to a point and then it became predictable.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The best book of the trilogy peers and katniss's love fir one another. The quarter quell scared me but still one of the best.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|It;s McCartney on the oldies-What could be better? Really has the McCartney touch. I hope he does more of the Oldie and Greatees!
0544045203|4.0|The book itself had a slow start to it that didn't spark my interest. Once we got to the ship wreck, I couldn't put it down. Great ending with a twist.
0307960471|3.0|While I enjoyed the book I also found it hard to read.  This is the third Nesbo  I have read and I like and dislike the stories at the same time.  I'll keep trying his books hoping to really like the next one and fascinated by the previous ones.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. A turn love story. OK didn't want it to end. I couldn't put it down!!!
B007V65R54|5.0|I am still in the process of reading Silver's masterpiece and enjoying every page.  Well written and very inceiteful. and intriguing
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think the game is excellent. I love the creative mode because I use it to show world's of some video games  I want to create when I become an adult. Although survival mode can get a little bit scary. I saw you should get this version of mine craft because I don't know about the other minecraft apps.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Have only played a little bit but you do have to watch which way you put your lines to match.  Fun so far.  When I stop for the night I still want to keep on playing.
B007SGM084|5.0|Best series I`'ve read in a long time. Would recommend time to read them all. Once you start, you can`t stop.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is about 4 hours long and completely worth it for Jane Eyre lovers!  If you don't like anything to stray from the book at all, then it may not be for you.  I liked that it added some conversations and realism to Jane and Mr. Rochester that made you love them even more.  It stayed true to the story and characters with a little joyous addition at the end of the movie.  I first rented this on Netflix and had to wait several days for the second disc. It was well worth the wait!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Amazing!! I loved this book. I think it's the best one in the series. Rick Riordan is my favorite author!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Simply incredible. An epic journey into the diversity and beauty of our planet that we never knew existed. A great gift for oneself and others alike.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|The Verso Artist are more than just Kindle covers that offer protection and carrying convenience. They are fashion statements and to some extent vehicles of artistic expression if, in this case, you would agree to classify calligraphy of city names and geographic locations as art. When it comes to Kindle covers it's hard for any particular product to stand out because there are so many of them but having so many choices is a good thing from a buyer's point of view.<br /><br />As a cover, the hard or hardened leather-like material should keep a Kindle safe and unscratched if dropped. The elastic straps holding the 4 corners keep the tablet safely attached to the cover without obstructing the screen. The soft, dark grey microfiber interior is a good match to the exterior's shiny red and blends well into the Kindle's own black. Extra utility is provided by an interior pocket.<br /><br />Of course, sometimes there is a price to pay for elegance. The cover has no lock mechanism - only gravity and the wearer's grasp keep it closed. And, there is no documented 'viewing stand' mode. While the 'no lock' feature is what it is and you either accept it or look elsewhere, you can actually turn the cover into a pretty good viewing stand and it can be done easily by flipping back the front cover. It works well on any not-slippery surface - tested it on glass, leather and some rugged fabrics - and it only takes about half a second to set it.<br /><br />Yes, the cover is not perfect but it comes pretty close and it's as original and elegant as they come and that should count for some extra credit.<br /><br />_______________________________________________<br /><br />NOTE: I didn't check any of these but this cover should fit well any 7-8\\" tablet for as long as it doesn't have a rear-facing camera. If the tablet has one then the buyer should accept that you must completely remove the tablet from its cover if you are to use that camera. This, of course, isn't an issue for the Fire HD because it only has a front-facing camera.because it only has a front-facing camera.
B008HK3TXK|5.0|I love this case. It fits my Kindle Fire perfectly and my device feels very secure. The Kindle fits in an inner sleeve and is then fastened w velcro. Very snug. The case closes with strong velcro. I am able to use it and charge it while in the case. It is also stylish. Unisex colors w the black, cream and maroon but the design is more feminine. Perfect for me.
B008TSVZHM|5.0|These little wallet sized card holders are fantastic!  Very well thought out, very intelligently designed.<br /><br />I've got a slew of micro-sd cards, and these are sturdy enough to survive being crammed into a wallet and tossed into a handbag.  (No small feat, if you'd ever seen my handbag.)  Each unit holds eight cards, which gives you up to 256 GB of storage capacity (using 32GB micro-sdhc cards), in one holder.  You can backup an entire computer's worth of files/photos/music to them, and carry your critical software with you in your wallet. (Which I routinely do, since I'm always on call during family visits, to cleanup the viruses, browser hijackers and keystroke loggers that they manage to get into during the year.)<br /><br />The micro-sd cards click into the holder, and they don't fall out.  I haven't actually stood on one of these to see if the cards would survive, (I'm not that crazy, those micro sd cards are expensive!), but they feel strong enough to stand up to it, and they have been dropped and tossed around with no trouble at all. I like the fact that the card holder is so compact. I don't have a lot of free space in my portable media player case - three of these holders just slide right in behind the player.<br /><br />Everyone who sees these wants one - and I've bought several as gifts, and need to pick up a couple more.  The only disadvantage I've noted is that there isn't much room to make note of the card content, but you can always slap a printed label on it, with very small type.<br /><br />Five stars for this one!
0553801473|5.0|...by all the negative reviews on this one.  I delayed reading it until just now, due to all the negative reviews, but this book is plain awesome.  I have just read all 5 in a row, reading Dance for the first time, and it is now my second favorite behind Storm of Swords.<br /><br />Nothing happens in this book?  I know everyone's impatient and we all hate waiting years for the next installment, but TONS happens in this book.  After being warned about it for 4 books, Winter has finally arrived, and with it many iconic moments, lots of pieces moving around, more trials and tribulations, more death.  After what happens to Tyrion alone, how can you say nothing happens?  This is not in the same realm as [[ASIN:B002ADRUWG Crossroads of Twilight]]... as someone who started reading The Wheel of Time 20 years ago and kept with it, buying each new book on day of release, trust me, it's not even close to being as plodding and frustrating as a few books in that series have been.<br /><br />For those of you doubting the future of this series... you have to trust the author.  I started reading this series when Storm came out and I too was not that thrilled with A Feast for Crows or the long wait for Dance, and thought Martin might be losing control of his baby... but upon re-reading Feast and knowing what happens after in Dance, I have a new appreciation for what Martin is doing and I trust he will end it satisfactorily.  It may take him longer than you'd like to get there, and he may have to expand it to 8 books (I would not be surprised) but he will get there.  It may not be what you expect... it certainly is not what I expected; Martin introduced a few twists with this book that I did not see coming, and I'm eager to see how he pulls it all together.  But the writing is no different in Dance than in Games.  There are just more characters to keep track of, that's all.  More details to divulge as more of the world and its history is revealed.<br /><br />At the end of Dance, Varys pretty much sums up what I feel is the thrust of the entire series: what it means to be a king, a ruler, a leader of men.  Our characters are faced with this dilemma constantly, and only those who understand it will win the \\"game of thrones.\\"  Only with Dance and the myriad things that happened to our characters in this book and new revelations, did I truly begin to see that.<br /><br />Can't wait for The Winds of Winter.
B0053O89KG|4.0|A gift for a friend. Bought a used set and they all look fine- but hasn't been viewed yet. Hope it is ok- was deliuvered on time as expected.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|A great running platformer game from the developers at Ubisoft. Graphics are impressive, gameplay is fun and never gets too stale, and levels are plentiful but short for quick bursts of action. Casual gamers will appreciate the low difficulty curve and veteran gamers will surely be challenged by the unlockable super difficult stages. The music may sometimes get a bit repetitive, but overall, an excellent mobile game.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Classic Out run in the palm of your hands! If you were a fan of the old arcade game, you're gonna love this!
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is was totally worth it, the small book that comes with it is sweet. The extras on the discs are pretty darn cool, and the movies on blu-ray in general is cool. Shipping was pretty darn fast and we love the movies and this set just made it better.
B004T4KKSA|5.0|This is a brilliant book. To understand the 20th century and the two World Wars, read this. To Understand the Oil and Gas Industry, read this.
B009SJ3GUK|1.0|Given the expectations set by the first season, this fell completely flat. Granted, I've only seen the first episode, and I'll probably give a couple more a chance once it comes out on Netflix, but I wouldn't pay extra to see them sooner. It seems, as is typical with many FX productions, that it has already quickly degraded from great suspense and out-of-the box writing, to nothing but gratuitous snippets and shock-and-awe sex moments that don't even need to be there for it to be great. I'm not being prudish in saying this by any means, it's just that it's not necessary and detracts and distracts from a show that otherwise had great potential.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Use this everyday on by tablet and my cell phone. Can't live without it.<br /><br />This is a such wonderful Christmas gift.
0307352145|5.0|Nothing wrong. Brand new. As expected. good book! good storyline. I love it!!!!! Nothing else to say. You should read it.
B000002KJM|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised to hear this debut album / cd from ZZ Top. I always had stayed away from this cd as this one really doesn't have any of their famous hits to choose from. But that's one of the factors that makes this so great.  Some good early bluesy tracks to choose from. This is one of their better efforts in my opinion. Their first album sure does please. But I do agree with some of the other people on here that this cd could of been produced better, but I still can enjoy a lot of the songs, but they could be produced better.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The game Coin Dozer is mindless entertainment. so easy to play while watching tv....I now understand how arcades make money.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|It's a classic! How can you not fall in love with the characters every time you read it! Jo is my favorite!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Easily loaded and good options. I have really enjoyed playing this version of mahjong.  Fun game and easy to get hooked.
B004P2CQM4|4.0|After reading the reviews, I almost didn't purchase an Air Swimmer.  My son loves Nemo, so I decided to give the clownfish a try, and I'm glad I did.  I followed the advise and got the 'Extreme' version which uses radio control rather than infrared - giving you much more reliable control.  Assembly was a bit tedious and the directions a bit obtuse, but I got through it.  I got it filled at iParty for $12 and it's still floating fine after 5 days without a refill.<br />For us, it has worked very well.  We swim it around our house without a problem, and it's a ton of fun.  Definitely glad I gave it a try, and would recommend it to friends.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|O_o WOW just as good as the series!  Different stories, but the heart of the characters is the same...AWESOME absolutely awesome!
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Purchased at very affordable price.  Arrived expediently for gift giving.  Giver delighted in receiving it though has not watched it yet.
B000XR4OC0|4.0|My daughter requested these for Christmas and we received the package very quickly.  She loves these shoes and is looking to get them in other colors.
1591396190|5.0|I read this book in one sitting and used it to help with a product I was launching. It's an excellent book, without doubt one of my favorite business books!<br /><br />Aside from being well written, it offers real step by step exercises that any business or product can use to differentiate themselves from the competition. 10/10.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|When the fall TV season ends I usually end up going pretty far down the rabbit hole in terms of what I'll rent. This was one of those rare instances where I couldn't even get through this awful movie. I honestly should've known better.
B000FC10H0|5.0|I was thoroughly impressed yet again by Al Ries - lots to like about this book, a must read for all marketers!
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I love how Nolan tied the series together in this Batman movie. It's not as good as Dark Knight but still a very good movie.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|We were overwhelmed by the wonderful message of this movie---that fathers need to be the loving authority and role model in their children's lives.Exciting plot and lots of realistic action keeps your interest, and the message is very clear but not preachy. Great movie for the whole family (except maybe the youngest children because of the action scenes). Should be required viewing for young men especially. Stresses the importance the father has in his children's lives, and how our society and culture need to return to traditional family values. We bought extra copies to give to our pastors and share with others.
B008Z9L8QI|5.0|This is a must buy for any Pumpkins fan. I love the inclusion of the b-sides plus remastering of the classic double disc.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|Bought it for a gift. They loved it, and its grown on me too... I might have to buy a copy for myself soon.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It kept my interest and was such an easy read. I would recommend this book to someone who enjoys a good who done it story with a twist.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was amazing! I couldn't put it down. I love it. This book was an inspiration. It thought me any things. And it was just all around a great book. I wish there was a sequel
B000003JA9|5.0|And they sound almost as good today, this was and is still a Great Album from my youth.  The memories.
B005UA0FLE|4.0|Not what I expected but still very nice to get in the spirit. Cheerful but not as upbeat or smoky as his songs usually are.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|my child and I love this game. great fun for us both. easy to navigate even for my 4 year old.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A fast moving intense read.  A look into the possible future of mankind informed by our past. I central figure is a little fantastic but except able.
1609613937|5.0|I am a very disciplined health nut, and was able to gruel through a decade of starvation for my \\"health\\" (in my 20s) and months on and off \\"Michael Thurmond 12 day body makeover\\" during the two years after I had a baby in my late thirties. It was high pressure, tons of work, but I am a determined person and will be in a size four no matter what. This lifestyle Dr. McDougall recommends, however, is not just healthy but a pleasure. Sounds too good to be true but it is not. I could have spared myself the pain of starvation and the gag reflex choking down egg whites I thought I \\"had to\\" eat for my health. Personally, I toed the water of veganism my whole life, for ethical reasons, however I had thought you \\"have to\\" have at least chicken breast or eggs now and then or your brain will shrink or something horrible will happen, like so many people are brainwashed to believe. When you read this book, it takes a bazooka to those falsehoods, and explains in graphic detail where they came from. The school of thought that says you \\"need\\" animal proteins are as obsolete as horse drawn buggies and telegrams. I've been in a cubicle and started getting office chair butt this last year. I went ahead and did the seven day challenge (I did ten days actually) and lost a solid seven pounds. I WAS NEVER HUNGRY. I am eating foods I love. I have higher seratonin levels than I have had in years. I will never eat meat, dairy, oils or processed foods again (at least on purpose). It feels like I have found the Holy Grail. Oh! And you smell amazing on this diet. You won't even realise how bad you stank on meat til you go off it for even one day.
B00004XMV6|3.0|Oh my...mickey rourke is sexy in this movie. That grin of his. Damn lol! Very hot! This is one of those movies that make you squirm in your chair while you watch it lol. Then you watch the storyline and you are like DAMN what in the hell is she doing with him? lol. Very messed up romance. BUT lol exxxtreeemely sexy even still :)
B006ZZANDI|5.0|My teenage daughter absolutely loves this ... it's nice that it gives some trivia about the band and also lyrics for some of the songs ... even I (as the mom) think they're an awesome band to listen to and sing along with!
B0053O89RY|5.0|Will become one of the classic TV series our children will talk about years from now.<br />DVD arrived quickly and was well packaged.
1451627289|2.0|The book didn't really make sense. The timetravel idea he used is novel and fun. But the book gets boring and for 200+ pages absolutly nothing happens and when it does it's a disappointment.<br />I would not recommend it.
1419707663|5.0|Our oldest daughter loves these books, and has even read them all, except that she borrowed them from the library and wanted her own set.  Personally I don't really get it, but she's reading and that's all that really matters.
1423140605|5.0|Given to 13 year old Grand-daughter.  She began reading it before dinner & declares she loves the whole series.  Good.
0810983915|5.0|Personally I don't really get this series of books, but the daughter loves them all, and she reads them, all good as far as I'm concerned.
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|Love the album! This album is better than Talk that Talk and Loud (which were both good albums). If you want to ride out, road trip or clean your house then put this on. Plenty of funky, danceable beats and even an appearance from Michael Jackson (sans Chris Brown on Nobody Business...lol)
B001HN6918|4.0|This is a kid's movie, the adult in me didn't care for it, but as it was a gift for my nephew, and he loved it I give it a 4.
630289915X|1.0|I thought it was a DVD instead it was a VHS which I can't use,  it was totally my fault, I didn't notice it in the description.  Love the movie so I ordered another copy in DVD.
B009POCG0Y|1.0|I thought since it stared Matthew McConaughey, it would be good. Wow, was I wrong! I was really disappointed in the movie & him as a person!  ! I'm so sorry I wasted my time. I expect so much more from a top actor with a family. I think he has truly lost his mind & will not watch him again! Stupid ending! Wish I could give it a -5 stars for how much I disliked it!
B0083V2W6I|5.0|I was 18 when I saw this at the movies originally, and thought it was one of the best films I'd seen and gave me a real rush.  Although there were clearly some acronisms, and the appearance of Sting and Toyah Willcox brought you back to 1979 rather than 1964, I thought it still captured the era well, and worked the Quadrophenia album tracks into the story really well, without I thought, spoiling the period feel that much.  Looking at it in 2012, they play up the violence too much, and yes, Jimmy is a loser (although that's really the plot of the original album). Also, they fail to totally capture how exciting the London live music scene was back then, although there are hints of it, the opening scene at the Goldhawk for instance.  It's a pity Pete Meaden died halfway through filming and was probably fading fast anyway, he could have helped them get that part right, he lived it!  From my reading of the period those mods were spending more time dancing at the scene club and pulling all nighters at  the Flamingo watching Georgie Fame or Geno Washington than fighting Rockers.  I would love to have been 18 then rather than 1979, even at the price of being 15 years older now!<br />  As for the DVD,  Criterion have done a great job.  Picture is sharp and the sound is good.  All the scenes missing from previous VHS/DVD versions are restored (Jimmy watching the Who on Ready Steady Go!  in his wet Levis for instance).  The extra documentries are very interesting too.  Watch the French documentries done at the time and then compare to the film to see how well they capture the period. Love Kit Lambert showing off his fluent French!  Watch this and then then American Graffiti to see the differences between the British and American youth experience.  Those were 2 great times & places to be young.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft. for 6.99 it is totally worth it.  My little cousin just loves it two. buy the game right now :)
075669812X|5.0|The boys love the green ninja lego character (normal lego character size).  They really enjoy reading about the other characters and some of their background.  It is a hardback book so it can withstand their rough play with the book.  It is definitely a good buy in my opinion (better price here compared to their school book fair).
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I am lost for words. This is truly an amazing work of art and a touching story. I will never get tired of reading a Nicholas Sparks novel. Amazing.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|This was a good movie.<br />Good comuniation, and  fast dellivery.<br />This sight wants way to many words for a review
B008JF8O9M|1.0|I downloaded this and it could'd find my printer.  Difficult to use and ultimately not useful.  It might work you, thankfully it was free.
B004LWZW9C|5.0|Saw this movie in the theater. Loved it. Dilivery was as said. Good comuniation. Pleas don't as for so many words
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love playing this game on my Kindlefire. It is a long of fun and easy to play. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys games.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Loved on my Wii years back and now I love it on my phone. Great time waster and much more thought provoking than Angry Birds.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I was very satisfied. It arrived within a day or two, was still wrapped in the plastic covering, and it works great!
B009LK6JS2|4.0|The controls work great and the graphics are surprisingly well done and almost console quality. Its a sneak peak of where mobile flight games will be headed in the future.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I was very satisfied. It arrived within a day or two, was still wrapped in the plastic covering, and it works great!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This was a great price for this movie, I could not of rented it for this price.  Will keep a eye out for more great deals.
B00004YRQA|5.0|I GOT THIS MEMORY CARD THINKING IT WAS ONLY 8MB BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY 32TB AND WAS LOADED WITH BOOTLEGGED GAMES. I PAWNED MY CAR AND THE TITLE TO MY HOUSE TO GET THIS AND THEN I SOLD IT FOR $18,000 DOLLARS AND RENTED A 5 STAR APARTMENT. I WIN.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|This was a great price for this movie, I could not of rented it for this price.  Will keep a eye out for more great deals.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|We just saw the movie, came back home straight to buy the book, love this novel, don't know what took me so long
0446554995|5.0|After being disappointed by the last book, i'm glad to say the boys are back with a vengeance.  What a great read, probably one of the best Pendergast books ever.  As to the negative reviews such as \\"HuH'  should read DuH....cant keep up with three plot lines you should stick with Dr Seuss.  Great to have the agent back in fine form.  Thanks for the great book!!!
B006VA57CY|5.0|One of the best program's around.  If you like historical/period dramas, then you should love this. Can't wait for season three.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I was very pleased with this book it is very useful especially for school and subjects such as school related.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Very good movie.  I usually don't like cartoons or pixar but this one I loved.  Great story line about a mother and daughter, nice break away from the usual father son.
1609611543|4.0|Gave as a gift to a family member. Book seemed to be in good condition and I received no complaints.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|This is a fun little app to use to edit photos.  It doesn't do a TON of stuff, but it does enough to get you by.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|It does the job as promised and it's rather quick overall I really like the product. The downside is it's not in the Google Play App Store (obvious reasons) and because of the app it always requires an update to work properly. The problem is amazon does not always make the update publicly available in time and I found myself searching the Internet for an updated apk for a manual install of the program.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I think they could do 100 sequels to this and I'd still love each one.  The story surprised me, which I really enjoyed.  I'd recommend it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The preview has me so excited for January and Season 3!  I gobbled up the first two here on Amazon Prime.  Plan to do the same with Season 3!
1449410243|5.0|This book was a lot of fun to read!  It was just as I had hoped it would be.....fun! We really enjoyed it!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|You are so awesome and creative for making this game! It is super super fun. Some of it is hard and some isn't quite so hard, it is just the right combination!!!!!  Fabulous game fabulous job!!!!!
B00AFWEPVI|2.0|Do I have a different kindle fire because mine takes decent pictures straight out of the box. What does this app do that's better?
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Start of book a little hard to follow but became easier as story fell into place.  I enjoyed it and recommend it.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|I downloaded this app to edit my excel spreadsheets on my android phone, but it doesn't support data validation or sumif functions. As a result, it is similar to all other apps offered on the market. Nothing special.<br /><br />I then found &#34;kingsoft&#34; a free app for android and desktop. It supports both data validation and sumif functions. Yeah.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved it I have lived to read this series and I have  loved all of them keep up the good work jeff
0062127241|4.0|I would give Pete Townshend's memoir five stars but for one flaw: he seems to give almost equal space to recounting his projects post-1978 (or post-1981, depending on how you want to look at the span of the Who's career) as he does to what came before. In fact, the Who's career itself is given short shrift. This is a mistake because, as should be obvious, the Who was Pete Townshend's only successful venture. As much as he wanted success in other ventures -- e.g., in publishing as an editor, or in musical theater -- he in fact achieved the very little that he did in those areas exclusively because of the appeal of the Who and its music. This is something that Keith Richards (and his excellent co-writer) understands: if we read his memoir, it's to know about those days when they were young and on the very top of a whole new world. It's also something that I believe Jimmy Page understands -- at least judging from his fastidious approach to keeping Led Zeppelin's legacy (1968 through 1980) intact, with only the most tasteful and minimal reminders of the post-Zeppelin period. That said, I would assume that this is the only memoir Pete Townshend could write. As he makes very clear, his stage persona with the Who in its prime was an incredibly taxing mix of rage and insecurity (and alcohol). I assume it would be rather painful to revisit those days once you've worked so hard to put them behind you. And he does admit the degree to which he has benefited from being an aging rock star. I only wish he'd been more honest about the fact that his later ventures were successful only to the degree that they tapped the Who. This is no knock on Pete Townshend and his genius -- which comes through abundantly in his writing, which is extremely good (he could have been a novelist I think) -- but only on his historical perspective. And I do like the way he writes so glowingly about all his many peers in the music business. The one interesting omission is Jimmy Page: there is no significant intersection of these two strange geniuses anywhere in the book. I wonder why. ... In sum: five stars for what this memoir offers, minus one for what it refuses.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Not that you would get tired of ponies, but it takes forever to get them all!  Otherwise it's pretty fun and simple, and good notifications make it easy to drop and pick up again.
B000MGB3FI|5.0|The Album is just what I expected. Excellent condition and graphics are sweet. This Album will add some classic rock to my collection.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Love it ! the game starts off easy but keeps building interest and becomes challenging.<br />I love playing it in free time :)
B00A80SHFM|5.0|After seeing the film in the theater, I sat in my vehicle and immediately downloaded the soundtrack.  I was so moved by the film and the music!  The actors sang the score while filming - they did not lip sing to a previously recorded soundtrack like most musicals.  Therefore, to truly appreciate this soundtrack, you really need to see the film first.  Then you will not be disappointed as some other reviewers have been (which they are comparing to the broadway, studio recorded versions).  I was especially incredibly surprised by the vocal abilities of Hugh Jackman, who plays Valjean.  Is there nothing that man can't do?  This movie was an experience that had me laughing, crying, gasping . . . and the soundtrack replays all of those emotions for me.  See the movie, then get the soundtrack.  You will be astounded as I was!  By the way, I have seen Les Miserables on Broadway twice - and I still love the film as much (maybe even more)!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I thought this could have been funnier then it was. Mark Wahlberg isn't the best actor, and the bear sounds exactly like Peter Griffen, you would think Seth could change his voice a little. Some pretty dumb jokes and scenes. Overall story wasn't very good.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I can't get this album out of my head! I love all the songs and I have been very happy listening to it.
B009GESJH2|5.0|As with previous Kid Rock releases, this one is awesome! It has some upbeat as well as slower songs. If you're a Kid Rock fan this is a great buy!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|A classic that we've enjoyed for years. Every time I watch it I see another humorous subtlety that I missed in previous viewings. This movie is packed with such things.<br />The DVD is top quality in visual and audio, and plays flawlessly in our player.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|A great movie that places the first Avenger in perspective.  One needs to watch all of the Marvel Movies, then watch the Avengers.  They are all so well done.  Too bad the marketing rights to Spiderman are with another media company.
0767802519|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter-in-law which she had been wanting for a while. This is a great classic.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Just a spectacular movie that puts all of the Marvel characters in perspective.  Casting is awesome, storyline is awesome.  We've watched a dozen times.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|enjoy these games more than any I have used before.<br />So many great choices! Buy Buy Buy Buy Buy Buy
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The characters are so fully developed that you begin to think of them as your neighbors.  This is truly one of Mr. Kings best and I appreciated the explanation for the \\"yellow card man\\" and glad you waited to the end to provide it
0316067598|5.0|This book is at the top of my &#34;must read&#34; list!  I even had my son (high school sophomore) read it for one of his book reports.  The level of patriotism and determination that this team of SEALs had/have is beyond inspiring!  I served 22 years in the US Navy and was fortunate enough to spend a tour with the SEALs as a technician, and I can say that these guys are legit!
B001RIY4WE|5.0|One of the best transfers!<br />I am not an expert but I do enjoy watching Blu Ray movies and this one has become one of my favorite<br />After calibrating my Plasma TV this movie looks amazing and the sound is great.
B00ADYYBFI|4.0|75% of this album is good. The songs with Gunner and Scarlett are the best ones by far and I wish there were more of them on the album. I had to download additional songs of theirs and add them to it. Definitely glad I bought it though!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love this App! Very simple and easy to use. I haven't had any problems. I especially like how easy it is to list litems and start an auction. Sweet and to the point. GREAT APP!!!
0743270754|4.0|Its vry interesting, but perhaps has more detail than needed which makes it slow reading. I have not finished reading it yet.
0596805527|5.0|JavaScript is a tough language to learn. This book helps to explain difficult concepts but the subject still requires hard study to learn.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app sucks,  it is slow and news feed doesn't work and also only shows a few lines on anyone's page you look at. It takes forever to load pictures, doesn't allow you to save pictures to you device. All around terrible app!!!!!
1475143389|5.0|Have been using a personal trainer, hoping I can learn it for myself and save some cash.  New year new fitness goals
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I chose this book because I wanted to continue the complicated romance of Ana Steele and Christian Grey. I really enjoyed the first book so I was excited to continue the trilogy. Most of the book was fine, but there were some slow stagnant parts that drew out some simple points in the story. There were some parts that I wished would have gotten to the point quicker, but overall I liked the book.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Got a lot of juice out of it. Incredibly easy to use.  Takes all the worry away out of losing power to your cell at bad times. Feels well made and a solid product.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|The whole CD is good, the best part was my Father (who does NOT listen to the radio or music at ALL) asking me if I had heard of this band after he heard &#34;Some Nights&#34; during a football game (and he watched the music video just thereafter)... I told him I had the CD, and let him borrower it for a week.  It brought me joy to see him interested in something since my Mother's passing earlier this year.. I also play most of it for my 9 yr old nephew when I take him to school.  Overall I would recommend for all ages.
B004QX07G4|5.0|An easy read and a good pick me up. Bound to lighten even the worst of moods!<br />A must read for anyone !
B002YVAT72|5.0|I purchased this item after researching USB turntables for several weeks. I read numerous reviews on every web site I could find. Sure, this is a cheaply priced item but it gets the job done and sounds fantastic running through a Yamaha receiver. The sound quality of recorded CD's is excellent as well. There will always be negative reviews for every product as you well know. Setup was easily accomplished in under 10 minutes. This unit performs exactly as it is advertised. If you are a music snob and expect superior concert sound quality, buy something else. Otherwise, the Average Joe such as myself will be thrilled. I have many old blues albums in various states of condition and all played without any problems. Important to READ the instructions before just slapping cords into holes. It's a simple design with excellent results!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I really like playing this game (I'm 70 not a child) but on the Kindle Fire HD 7-inch the screen does not show enough.  I would really like to play it on my PC in Facebook or as a stand along.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I love this type of game, but it is small on my phone.  Most of the time you can enlarge the screens, but then get penalized for random clicks as you move the screen.  It is a fun story though.  I like this well enough to keep playing.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|This is the most complete study Bible I have ever used. It is like having several reference sources at hand, but all in one volume!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book takes the reader to a new level in fiction and possibly paranormal.  A fresh story line that begs to have another book.  The reader is taken into a world never heard of before.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|Wow, Amazon really does love us.  First the World of Goo and now Edge as a free app of the day?  Awesome.<br /><br />Edge really is a fantastic game.  I bought the original a while ago and despite being deceptively simple, it has great game play value.  The levels are lean and clever and offer a good challenge without being obnoxious or frustrating.  It is certainly worth the asking price.  Free is even better.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A book I couldn't put down; cried & smiled through it all. Definitely worth reading, really changes the way you think about things.
B0081SPK0I|4.0|This game feels fantastically like an old school arcade racer from the late 80s.  I take that as both a pro and a con, hence the 4/5.  Much like the old school car games, I have no idea how you'd ever complete the game on one quarter...
B0057RCFQS|5.0|Brand new, still in the original package. Received it quick Love this movie, deff recommended it for those who like Jurassic Park.
B004SBULWE|5.0|Easy to see whats running as well as killing unnecessary apps. I have used this app for years and it always performs well.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My daughter wanted it for christmas from santa.  I don't know how the elfs made it but it was under the tree.  MAGIC!!
B004T4KKSA|4.0|Daniel Yergin has an interesting way of writing history and does it especially well for the travails of past oil entrepreneurs and tycoons.  He couches the word oil in terms of &#34;the prize&#34; and places it as a commodity at the epicenter of the modern economy.  He makes the case for the resource's growing power and influence in the modern world and leaves the reader to determine whether we are better or worse for it.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This case is lightweight and inexpensive - a great deal.  It fits the Kindle Fire perfectly and the stand works well despite some other reviews.
B005LAIH54|4.0|I found itt to be more believe able than the original.  The new characters made it better!! Sam Worthington is very good.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|A great game for your Kindle Fire. I love the many choices I get for game play.  Recomended for those who enjoy a good game of Mahjong.
B0053O89XI|5.0|This show just keeps getting better and better. Directors would not change a thing. Great job. Hope many more to come.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This is a hilarious show even for those of us who aren't brainiacs. It's funny and cleaver making it a great gift for my son.
B001XRLWPQ|4.0|Excellent show for those who miss the wit of Firefly. Fillion is at his best and the supporting cast has great chemistry. If your unfamiliar do watch. This is not your normal murder mystery show.
B000HKW7E0|1.0|I am normally 100% satisfied with anything from Amazon, but I could not get this movie to completely download to my Kindle and still can't. So I feel it was $2.00 waisted. But I love this movie, just wish I could have watched it.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This version of facebook for the Kindle is lame! You can only scroll down and view maybe 10 posts and after that you can't view anything older than that. Also, when you view pictures there is no &#34;done&#34; button to take you back to the feed.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Wish there were more shows like this one, will watch it over and over again. Music is fantastic. The story is interesting, love the characters. Highly recommend this one.
1442419814|5.0|I read this book when I was probably 12 years old. I'm now 18 and I still haven't forgotten this series. I would finish 1 book in a few hours because I couldn't put them down. I've read everyone in the series and this one is still my favourite because you get to read about both sides uglies and pretties. I;m not going to write a synopsis on the book because I don't want to spoil it and I think it should encourage you to read it for yourself. I recently bought this for an 11 year old girl who loves to read and I think she will like it. Now I'm not sure if it will appear to older audiences because of the language used for the book but it's worth a read if you like action and futuristic stories. As a side note, the cover of the book has changed and I don't really like it because I feel it looks very girly and the other one didn't so now it doesn't appeal to a wider audience.
B0090X4GJE|1.0|I just didn't get it at all.  What is all the hype about?  Don't waste your time or money on this one.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I loved this movie. I enjoy the message they put into it and I loved the animation and colours. It's a good one to have on dvd. It doesn't really follow the book much but they did well with making it into a whole full length movie.
B009CPRYG2|5.0|If you liked the original graphic novel you will like this movie. If you never read the graphic novel, this is a great place to start learning how the Batman renaissance happened.<br />I personally like this movie and the animated Year One movie better than Nolan's 'Dark Knight Rises'. Anne Hathaway? Really??<br /><br />The animation is flawless (and so very close to being exactly drawn like the graphic novel), and the voice narration is top knotch - especially Batman and Alfred. Peter Weller does a great job.<br />Cant wait for Part II with the Batman/Superman battle!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Will become a Christmas Classic! Rod Stewart, Celo, Mary J Blige, etc make a perfect combo for unforgettable arrangement of holiday songs. Saw the concert on TV and had to have it.
B000SZK41M|5.0|Was great when it came out and still a classic after 25 years.  Alan Rickman is just wonderful.  Great bad guy
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|A great classic. A movie could be made with today's modern technology to more accurately depicted this book. I'd go see it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|very good for news on weather for husband that travels a lot and family that lives far away. Helps us prepare  for emergencies.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app it's amazingly awesome. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone who has a kindle fire.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry is back and as good as we've come to expect. My only complaint is that I could not put it down and it went by too fast.... Can't wait for the next one.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is super scary espacially if your playing in the dark with the KINDLE FIRE I picked up the first page and it said behind you . So I looked behind and I saw slender in the way distance and then I turned back around and and he was standing like ten feet a in front of me and I almost scrapped my pants!!! I drop my KINDLE and like scooted back three feet I was super scared. Oh FYI it might be all lagging if u have the the KINDLE FIRE HD. my friend has a kf HD and when he brought it over to my house we tried playing slender we r in the dark and it was so laggy that we just quit playing. Overall very very great and scary game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Such fun. I use it alot. and I am glad that I have it on my kindle fire. Thank you
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game and so do my kids great for them. And I can kill time with it too awesome all the way
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Cover to cover and enjoy it very much. I cant wait for the movie to come out in theathers. yeah
B005N95JA4|5.0|Listen to &#34;The  Girl With the Faraway Eyes&#34;. I loved this album so much that I ran 20 red lights in the Stones' honor.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Lots of fun and challenges as you go along. kids have a great time and good for hand eye coordination
B007ZLKK9I|5.0|Excellent coverage of George's life, music and contribution to the human collective. Very rare unseen clips and pictures and provided deep insight to his philosphy.
1419707671|5.0|The Diary of a Wimpy Kid series is a fantastic introduction to reading for many elementary school kids.  Humorous and easily read, coupled with the movies these books stand a good chance of making your young children want to become readers.
0439875889|5.0|Fast arrival - as expected but not as pictured- confusing picture includes CD.<br />Great children's book - my kids loved it when they were young.
B008DB2Y3O|5.0|If you like Big Time Rush, this album will not disappoint!  High energy and fun songs that I'm not afraid to let the kids listen to while driving in the car.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I got a new Kindle HD and found an offer for this game. I thought this might be similar to the Atlantis series of games I have played on the PC and decided to give it a try.<br />If you like the Match 3 genre this is a fun an entertaining game.  At is core it has the standard set of features match 3 games with matching 3 to eliminate tiles and a bonus for matching 4. But to make it a little more fun it is interwoven (quite well) with an engaging story line and a quest to collect artifacts (you collect pieces during each subgame). The artifacts help you solve a puzzle that is the underlying storyline.<br />The graphics is good, the storyline is well done so all in all if you like match 3 you will almost certainly like this game. If you don't like match 3 you probably won't. But if you are considering trying match 3 for the very first time this would probably be a pretty good choice.
B001P06GX4|4.0|This game challenges even the best minds. By playing the different colors each player works to play all their pieces first without having sides touch. Only corners. Many hours of great clean fun in this easy to learn game that challenges your tactical thinking skills. And no two games are ever the same!!! Great purchase.
B009KKLQKO|5.0|This review is from: The Beach Boys Live in Concert: 50th Anniversary (DVD)<br /> I am disappointed because I received a big slice of the pie but I want ALL of it! I was at this Phoenix concert and was so stoked when I found out they were taping the concert for DVD. 50 songs were played and the concert lasted more than 3 hours. Come on Brian and Mike. Give us the whole enchilada! Brian, I sat behind your wife and children. What a beautiful family. PLEASE, PLEASE, you owe it to your fans to put out all 50 songs. I have been following you guys for 50 years man! I grew up in the mid 60's in the LA area and your music was so instrumental in my life. If I was bummed out, I would crank up the Beach Boys and it always put me in a better mood. I have a dedicated room with all of Beach Boys and Brian Wilson paraphenalia. It's a shrine. I want to thank all you gentlemen for the pleasant memories.<br /><br />Norman Kydd<br />Maricopa, Arizona
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Great packaging and even better Christmas story. The Great Gonzo plays Charles Dickens and tells the story of A Christmas Carol beautifully. Not overly dark so it's good for everybody. Very heart warming.
B00A757EFW|2.0|I was about to finish the second board and the screen dimmed and invited me to purchase the full version. I didn't even get to finish one game.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|app worked once and has crashed every time since. I only downloaded this app because Skype stopped working for some reason and thought it had something to do with needing a camera installed.<br /><br />bummed that the camera was not included with the purchase.
0920668372|4.0|This book was a favorite read of my daughter to her children a number of years ago...........I was pleased to see it on Amazon books even thought I wasn't looking for it!! It did not arrive in time for Christmas, but did arrive in great condition and was<br />so appreciated. Thank you !
B0072GPQ72|5.0|Read the book first, the book is written with the War Horse view of the story.<br />Liked the movie and the DVD, its just an amazing story of the horses and the<br />roll they played in Word War One.<br />It was rather sad to see how most were just abandoned at the wars end.
B009B8YZIK|1.0|A waste of time. Terrible story line and super slow development. One of the worst movies watched in the last five years. I had to grab my iPad and played games while waiting for a new scene.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Easy to use. Works as described. Will definitely recommend, to anyone wanting a cheaply priced good product. Will probably buy another to give away.
B00AE6SS5O|4.0|Enjoyable and fun game.  Very cute.  Multiple mini games in each level to prevent boredom and just difficult enough to keep you interested in playing an admittedly casual game. Not a game for you if you are wanting a complex or difficult game.<br />Different and unusual storyline.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|Great action and very good story about the vampires.  Would recommend it to any adult.  Enjoyed it very much.  Jamie
0140067477|5.0|bringing you back with the flavour and personalities of Winnie the Pooh's world and the knowledge and stories of Taoism,buddism and pooh-ism<br /><br />A short read but I reccomemnd 100% for any spiritual Pooh lover.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|After the vendor replaced a bad OTG cable, this program works OK with USB memory stick. It does not seem to work with USB drives, which is probably because external drives need more power than the N7 can supply.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have played allot of solitare games and the graphics on this particular one is great. Fairly easy to play as well.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I totally adore this book! A wonderful plethora of drama and romance! I could barely put it down! I cannot wait to read the next book!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very addicting!  Great thinking game especially for the kids.  My 6 year old loves it as well!  I would highly reccommend this game!
B004P95A8E|5.0|Great service fast shipping.  I do not have that much to say. It was bought for a gift. My great grand kids liked it.
B009ANP4F4|3.0|When I saw the previews to this movie, I thought &#34;wow&#34; my son would love it so I ordered it for him for x-mas. That wasn't the case. It was kinda boring, it seemed like there was more ballet moves than hip hop. Other than the movie itself, the shipping was fast and I did receive it on time, nothing against Amazon.com. I should have read the reviews on this movie before I ordered it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Once I start playing I cannot put it down!  I keep telling myself I will put it down after I complete one more mission but it ends up being a lot more than that.  And it's FREE!!!
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|What more can I say about this awesome CD? I love The Band Perry so just GOTTA love the CD!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great mix of interesting characters and action sequences.  Exactly what I buy this type of book for.  Plenty to keep you interested and turning pages for fun!
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I was a fan of the original series, I am also a fan of Tim Burton/ Danny Elfman duo. While the more somber overtones of the original series was missing, the new take was very enjoyable. It will be rewatched, but not in a high rotation.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|It is not as exciting as the previous books. It doesn't show any of Reacher's actions and unlike the other books the ending is a bit too &#34;soft&#34;.
6304696515|4.0|Was working on the stage show the movie's based on this past semester so it was great to see how much it was like the play yet had some sneaky differences from the play that were sometimes better sometimes not. Great performances, even if I can't picture John Malkovich as an ladies man. And the costumes are amazing!
B00005JKGK|5.0|My students loved this movie! I recommend teachers assigning this movie because the book can be confusing to read.  It would be a great way to vividly show students what the book was about!
B006K2WXOI|5.0|It was great! I loved it! Good book! Awesome describing words! Fantastic! Perfect! I really like this book a lot!
B004HO6I4M|5.0|It was a great family movie! I would recommend it to all families. I didn't realize how funny it would be!
B007TXN4TK|1.0|Kill it. Kill it with fire. It's horrible. It's slow. Nothing like the free piano apps that I have on my iPod. DO NOT GET THIS APP FOR KINDLE FIRE HD.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I very much enjoyed reading the book.  The author Dr. Davis does a good job of explaining the science behind why our bodies react the way they do when we ingest certain types of food.  I've tried a few recipes and they taste pretty good.  I have lost weight, but frankly I'm more grateful that I FINALLY lost  a couple of % of body fat.  I've only had the book a little over two weeks so I have a long way to go toward my goal.  But in the meantime I've already noticed the skin on my face is clearer and glowing.  And my nails are long too.
B0096DZKZC|1.0|did not download successfully and there is no easy way to cancel the download.  wouldnot recommit this to anyone. blab blab
B002XXLKHY|4.0|Our family enjoyed this movie. Suprisingly there was no inappropriate content. It was very funny with a good Christmas story line.
B007THA4FI|3.0|This book is totally different from the H. Potter series.  She handles the social issues like bludgeons, and none of the characters are very likable. I started but don't think I'll finish it.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Very good game and nice graphics love how you put in achievements! It is also a time consuming app for all ages!!
B004LROUNG|4.0|This isn't my favorite of Grisham's novels, but it was an enjoyable and quick read.  The characters were well-drawn and amusing.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Watched this movie as soon as I received it. Saw it in the theater in IMAX and knew I had to have it. Sounds best with surround sound.
B00APUQJLO|5.0|I've read reviews about this film being boring and pretentious but I found it to be very entertaining and it was even funny at times. The dialogue is lifted exactly from the book and it may be a bit too wordy for some, but I loved it! The stilted dialogue makes the film more surreal and dream-like. It's like the characters are in another universe. It also had a lyrical feel to it. It was like listening to a poem.<br />The film was both subtle and striking. I've watched it many times and each time I have a different reaction. It was the type of film that made me go home and think. It stayed on my mind until the second viewing and I had a completely different reaction then.<br /><br />Don't look for the fast paced thriller that you see in the trailer. I think this is why most people are not pleased with the film. They go in expecting one thing an they get another. The movie is slowly paced and can leave you feeling cold alienated and suffocated. It is about a man that doesn't seem to be in touch with reality and it will leave you feeling the same way. As the movie progresses Eric becomes more and more human.<br />When watching this movie you shouldn't think too hard about it or try to understand everything. You will enjoy it a whole lot more.<br /><br />Cosmopolis is also actually very funny if you pay attention. I found myself laughing during at a lot of it. Mostly in the scenes with his wife. It's funny how those two are married but they don't even know each other at all.The banters between them are extremely hilarious especially their tone and how they seemed to have no idea how to talk to one another. They talk but neither one seems to be listening.<br />The film was unforgettable, especially the last shot. Keep an open mind when watching Cosmopolis.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Works well and just the right amount of challenge.  Good color and sound.  Keeps you entertained for many<br />many hours

B009WO7NQO|5.0|Who couldn't adore these little creatures, no matter what costume they may wear?  I just love this game.  AHHHH, and REVAMP and bomb....all of those cute little creatures and the challenge they create!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book is so interesting and put things in perspective me. The fact the Dr.regained all his facilities after being in such a deep and extensive coma is a miracle. He is the anomaly for comas.I recommend this book and read with an open mind and heart.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I liked this one even better than the Part One CD, and much better than the Eclipse CD.  Many enjoyable tunes, well worth the purchase.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|good fun but there are a few bugs, options don't come up and the top bar with information is missing sometimes. also it says there's no internet connection when there is
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|What a cd, came in great shape sounds even better, need to get this if U don't have it, Grammy winners and I can hear why
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read this in two days. I've never read such a page turner. I thought it'd swing towards a Twilight puppy love but it seemed real... Like I was watching a movie or in the arena myself. Super awesome twist at the end too! CAN'T WAIT GET #3!
B0000029J5|5.0|This cd is great for any mood U are in, if blue than he will join U there with his music
B00785P2QC|5.0|virtual city playground is a fun game. game advances levels quickly<br />and fairly easily. I like how game continues even when not playing and nothing blows up, ........ lol
B0040HJNKC|5.0|If no Buddy Guy in your music than U are missing out, this Cd is one of his best. Had to go see him in concert the first time he came near after hearing this CD
B0017SWPXY|5.0|One of the best books that I have read in a long time. A book to inspire and remind us of what it truly means to live!
B000IFQLSW|5.0|Kenny sure works hard at his music , saw him once and this CD represents him well and will get U rocking
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|The pets are a lot of money and shirts shirts you have to buy for a lot and missions are hard
B006LSZECO|5.0|Could not put it down! The girl was crazy, but then so he is. Wish A little. Wish it ended different, though.
B008OOYALE|1.0|The company producing these \\"story\\" apps has a lot to learn about customer service. I was recently charged six times for a single transaction, for which I never saw the in-game coin, and it took days for the company to simply tell me they couldn't help with a refund.  It took Amazon.com (my payment gateway) mere moments to clear the whole thing up.  The rest of my issues in bullets points:    - game constantly freezes and often needs a hard reboot to close  - leveling up is far too dependent on in-game coin  - cannot run more than 2 TeamLava apps per device, eliminating the opportunity to earn free coin    Ultimately, there are a lot better free games out there that run better and are just as much fun when you want to kill time. I will be running this app for a while longer but I have no plans to ever spend money with this company again.    Anecdotally, I did finally receive a response to my overcharge issue when I took all the email addresses from the TeamLava website (PR, Marketing, etc) and blasted them with my refund request.  Here's the contact link:[...]. Once I received a response, the Storm8 Twitter account also responded to me with an apology and a justification/argument about their slowness.  No offer to compensate me for my trouble has been forthcoming thus far.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|it was slow at the beginning, but them it gets better, i will recommended to a friend any day, good quality.

B005M2V2K8|5.0|Teddy is a very sweet and gentle ...was a gift and loved the girl, it looks like a princess... happy with purchase
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Since I loved Star Wars and Angry Birds, I thought I would give this a try.  Lot of fun playing it.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|without words, is a great movie, the packaging is the best and in addition to that the parties had not seen, the production is very good buy and cheaply.
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|The story was not very entertaining.  It was slow moving. I think that the storyline could have been portrayed in a more interesting way.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|Love this film. Has great acting and a true story line unlike a lot of junk you see today. In short if you haven't seen it pick it up and you will love it as well
B0079R8IYW|4.0|but should have looked for the purple cover for the wife. my bad. the flap on the back is a bit awkward.
B009MF5BXK|2.0|The DVD was shipped late then was out of stock then when it came the DVD was scratched up so I can see the first 10 min or so I bought something new waited a long time when I could of gotten it at a store quicker. The movie is good from what I saw.
B007SGM084|5.0|Many of the previous reviews focused on the erotica of the first novel and the price of the trilogy.  You should not read Fifty Shade without reading all three books because it is a great romance novel and demonstration of how unconditional love can save the soul of an abused person.  I loved it!  There was love, sex, suspense and danger--all of which make for great reading.  It deserves the five star rating.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|We obtained this app on the \\"free app of the day\\". My children love the creativity of the app and find it very fun.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|Even if you saw the Arnold Swartzenegger Total Recal movie, this one is different and worth watching.  Mostly action, and okay for families.  I liked the fact that it didn't have gruesome scenes like a lot of movies these days, but still had the action.  Got entertainment movie.
B009FZFONO|5.0|A great series.  I got hooked on that online video company and needed to see what happens next.  Amazon fed my addiction.  The quality was excellent.  I can't wait for new videos.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook for phones and other devices is OK but there needs to be a way to allow for all the features, like deleting a post other than just online.  And if there is one that I am unaware of then I think there needs to be clearer instructions for that.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This movie is excellent. Its a great follow on the other movies. I wish that Matt Damon could be in it also.but Jeremy was just as great.
B007MJSQSK|3.0|The animation was beautiful. The movie starts up fun an entertaining. However by the end it slows down and the ending is uneventful and slow.
159315724X|5.0|Even though this book may tend to get a lot more publicity than 'the slight edge' I believe it is just a good companion book to it. Don't get me wrong, this is a good book as well and I love it. Just think it ought to be read after the foundation is set with 'the slight edge'
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|An awesome Disney movie!  A must watch!  Funny, fun, & entertaining!  I don't believe any family member will be disappointed.
B0009HLD0K|5.0|Just what I ordered.a movie it  was delivered fast and in perfect condition Nothing much else to say on this product
B00APUQT7I|4.0|A definite must watch; Fun for the whole family!  If you liked the previous Ice Age's, this one will be up your alley.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Movie started out real confusing. Both my wife and I thought that if we havent seen the previouse movies , We would be lost.  That was not the case . It was an excellent movie , alot of action , And the ending was just perfact. We both loved it!!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Easy to use - just like on my laptop. One of the most useful apps available.  Wish others were this good.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|i just love the part where you can get more things knocked down with his light saver if you just tap him.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Difficult to use at first but after going through a number of trials it's OK.  Limited access - not like the real Google.  Plus the text in the results is too small, and there is not enough room between selections to tap accurately.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I Read this book and it just made me see things differently. It's a great book, a wonderful book.<br />Definitely recommend it to any young person or any person of any age, it's such a great book.
B001J4E1D8|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I'm a sucker for a good chick flick every now and then.  This one fit the bill and my wife loves it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|When I first downloaded this game I thought it would be boring since I never play this type of game.But I was wrong it's actually quite fun and can be addicting I played for hrs without realizing how time has actually passed.I recommend if you just want to try something different then what your used to.
B00770KR7W|4.0|If  you are into the Halo world, this is a good copy of Master chief. Highly detailed and looks good anywhere.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is totally addictive! Good for adults as well as children 5 and up. Great on a long flight too.
B00110K62U|5.0|I already had the 25th Anniversary Edition but I find the 10th edition to be better simply because it has more of the familiar original casts.  The singing is superb and the lighting magnificent.  One can’t go wrong whenever they watch  Les Miserables, but this is one of the best of the many soundtracks of L.M.<br /><br />-- D. Wolf
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I could not put it down. Loved every page. One that you will definitely reread and highlight amazing quotes in.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Helps organize my life very easily.  use it for personal and business and helps get my life in order.  thanks
B0011Z51QG|5.0|I have always been a fan and this is the first album I ever heard of his; so its the first one I wanted to download to my kindle.
B00466HNHM|5.0|great movie to watch with the whole family, rip whitney houston, you will be forever missed but forever able to watch over and over
B008KRJWEK|5.0|Amazing it's kind of like temple run though but my opinion is that it's better can't believe it's free though
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|So funny.  I lost my best friend the same week I watched Ted (8 year old boxer that I had since she was a pup).  Needless to say, I got it. The movie totally struck home.<br />Add to that, unexpectedly good acting and production, and you've got a winner.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Best book I have ever read. In my opinion it is Sparks best novel so far. I would encourage everyone to read this book.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book it was so funny and surprising at the same time. You out did yourself jeff kinney
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I chose four stars because i didn't understand some of the definitions they gave me. I like how the settings of the book could be changed to fit what the reader likes to read with. I didn't like some definitions because of how they were described. I would recommend this book to anyone. It‘s great to have.
B000JO9JHW|2.0|too gruesome.  I watched the pilot and it was not intriguing, too violent and gruesome and this requirement for more words, suck!
0399160450|2.0|Does Tom Clancy write any of his own novels anymore? Frankly, I find all co-authored books to be awful. After being burned 2 or 3 times I vowed never to knowingly buy such books. And, have you noticed how the publishers will put the secondary (actually really probably the sole author) in such a tiny font, that on an Amazon page it is possible to overlook the fact it IS a co-authored book. Personally, I find this way of marketing to be very sleazy and I wish they would just stop.
B001NHNG64|5.0|DIE TRYING<br /><br />For me after One Shot, is the most interesting one of Lee Child´s that I have read, although I must say that I enjoyed most of his books.  As for Echo Burning, I haven´t read it yet.
B009439HEY|4.0|Took a few listens to warm up to the different vocalists, but after that, I can't stop playing this.<br /><br />What a bargain for all the gems that are included on the 2 disks.  The sound quality is stellar, sounds great cranked up.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Hackett-era Genesis, this is a no brainer, get it!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This is a great cover for the price. It is Durable, light weight and easily to put on and remove.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|movie was new and came packaged well.  watched it and it was good  everything seems good so far i would recommend
B00A23MYCC|3.0|thought it was going to be funnier<br />i don't know what more to say but it's telling me i need more words
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Good book and very quick read. Kept my attention and interest while reading. Was just sad it was over so soon.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really don't know what to say about this book. Is it emotional? Yes. Is it gut-wrenching? Yes.<br />it is heart-breaking? Yes But it's also heartwarming, hopeful, amazing, and just incredible. This is a love story, have no doubt. One of the best I've read.<br />But I won't lie to you. There is some rough stuff in here. Some parts you will have a hard time reading. If you are like me, you will cry, or sob. But there are also parts that will leave you breathless in a good way.Happy, even. None of the rough stuff detracts from the great either. It helps it make sense. You understand why these two people feel the way they do for each other. You will feel it right along with them.<br />Read this book, but be prepared for how powerful it is. It will stay with you for a long time.
B000P0J0A6|4.0|With its inane mix of genres, attitudes and inspirations, there's really no good reason for this movie to work as well as it does. Like the ubiquitous creatures at the heart of the plot, Gremlins delights in mayhem. The proud owner of a restless spirit and a tendency to rattle the gearbox at the slightest hint of a lull, the film can be splendidly unpredictable, charmingly sweet and morbidly profane, sometimes all within the same scene. It's vividly violent, often shockingly so, but still touts a wild sense of humor and an unexpected knack for sentimentality. I was pleasantly surprised at the lengths it was willing to go to, considering no member of the cast indispensable, and that left me hooked right up until the closing showdown. It's not the perfect picture - there are holes in the plot large enough to roll a bulldozer through - but as a sharp, silly change of pace in the holiday season, one could do far worse.
B005LAIHYU|1.0|The case was shattered and only held together bc the plastic and the paper. Thankfully the disc was not scratched.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is an excellent t book, written not buy a professional author, but by a warrior who was actually been there and done it. No frills, no literary ju jutsu by an English major, but a documentary that gives credit to the people who earned it. He wrote it while the lawyer turned politician turned storytellers were falling over themselves trying to take credit for the actions of the author and his fellow warriors.
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|Dumbo is a classic!  I forgot exactly how sad it was but it is still a great movie.  My kids and I sat and watched it together the day after Christmas.  They loved it and I loved sharing it with them.
B002SSUQFG|1.0|I have a problem with the watch, once you put the time, this can not keep, is delayed.<br />Can you help me?<br /><br />Regards.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|HELL YUSS IT IS EPIC!!!!! LURVE IT!! IM BEING TOTES SERI!!!!! YOU JELLI? LA LA L AL L AL AL
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Gift purchase for daughter.  Exactly what she wanted/needed.  Compact- takes very little storage space when not in use.  Decent price as well.
B0081336FO|5.0|ITS BOSSOME, NO OTHER EXPLAINATION!!!! LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA AL AL
B007BFSYMS|4.0|This is a fantastic app and it works great to help me sleep. I had the app on my iPod touch but I wanted it on my new Google Nexus 7, and I loved the mixing feature that let me have different sounds together and it would be perfect to have that on this one. Thanks! :)
B00499QUK2|5.0|L I K E  A  B O S S !!!!! H A  H A  H A  H A  B L U H!!!!!
B003O86FMW|3.0|It is rather devoid of plot and seems to be a patched together story with flawed characterization which makes for shallow reading
B007DIQC90|5.0|This could have been a real Masterpiece, if only this album had been produced by the very experienced \\"John Porter,\\" the Producer of \\"The Smiths.\\" However, even with production done by the performers, it is still very good...But, again, could have been much better with the skilled ear engineering techniques of world renowned Producer, John Porter. Next time, use a professional producer; you are too good for anything else!
B005HSL626|5.0|I love the challenge of this one.  Again, thanks Amazon for being the top in my books for stuff for myself and my kindle....love you guys!
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|After watching movies like the Dark Knight and Inception this movie is not at the same level.  i would say 75% of it is spot on with great story line and interesting charecters bulit well and of course a very real feel compared to other comic book films.  The movie is a must see for any movie fan, but 25% of the movie lacked in story board and felt very cliche.  Which is hard for me to say given the fact that Nolan is a genius and I am probably holding him to a higher standard that I would any director at this time.  I consider Nolan and Jackson a 1a 1b right now in film of this era for blockbusters.<br /><br />that said, having a count down bomb, that is simply taken away and dumped feels very superman flying missiles into space.  It's kinda lame and very much a let down after seeing just about the best comic book movies of all time.  I get it simple sometimes works better than over complicating things it just was a bit of a Ah ha moment when i looked at my firend and said, a count down bomb really!  He flies it out to sea and saves gotham, yawn.<br /><br />So if you think of it in the context of a comic it is spot on, but if you think of what Nolan is capable of it is a good movie.<br /><br />Thats why i give it 3 plus stars and reccomend, but remember a Dark Night only come once every 25 years with a performance like Ledgers and this movie is no Dark Knight.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game!  I am so glad that Amazon offers freebies for the kindle as I am still so new to it.  My family loves this product and we recommend Amazon and Kindle products to our friends regularly.  Keep up the good work!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|We are a movie family and this is a huge hit with the little girls. Everyone wants to have red hair now.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Good information. Easy to use application. Nice to see reviews of places I have stayed and plan on staying. Good format.
B0053O89WY|5.0|The next year in the set. Price was a little high, but I guess it is the cost of getting what you want.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Rebellion, suffering, love, creativity, and an enduring spirit of survival fill this book.  They face the games again. Try it.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Have enjoyed Dylan's recent albums with the New Orleans sound to them.<br />As always, his longer &#34;story&#34; songs are my favorites.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Movie is Great. I liked it a lot. I recommend this movie to any Batman fan. Can't wait to see Robin.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Beautiful though some very sad and sorrowful songs; tremendous guitar work as always; and a beautiful voice to sing them.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is a timeless classic to be enjoyed by people of any age, just so long as you have an imagination. If you have watched the film and think you know everything there is to know about this story, you're in for a surprise with L. Frank Baum`s classic adventure.
B000002AGN|5.0|After Brubeck died, we could not find our old vinyl version.<br />Thsi really brought back great memories.<br />The CD was delivered promptly and as advertised.
B004ZWKWQQ|4.0|It says for 14+ but my 12 year old did just fine.  The step by step books were great, and he was obsessed with it for 2 days!
B008EZVNO0|5.0|IMO, best Van Morrison CD in years....  Really enjoyed the &#34;jazzy&#34; nature of many of the tracks...  If you want to hear a different side of VM, this is the cd.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Kept me going, wonderfully complex.  I have always enjoyed Grisham and this  was no exception.  That we could all tap into such a rich imagination.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I didn't have great expectations for this movie. I thought it would have a few good scenes that were just an expansion of the trailer. I was surprised to find the movie was not just about \\"Fat Amy\\" and there are several characters that give nice performances. Good date night movie that had laugh after laugh from us. Would definitely recommend.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|Awesome! The songs on the album brought back my youth. More so, the songs depict who AC/DC is today. Crazee!
B000QK90CI|5.0|With a love for facts, a keen eye on the story, and the ability to completely pull you into the world of Motorcycle racing. \\"On Any Sunday\\" shows clearly a love like no other. Well worth seeing again and again. Thoughts of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" come to mind. DO NOT MISS THIS MOVIE.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It was interesting, Too  much sex, got to be boring but storyline was interesting.  I got used to the characters and so was anxious to see what would happen to them next
0920668364|5.0|MY DAUGHTER IS 20 YEARS OLD AND I BOUGHT HER THIS NOOK WHEN SHE WAS 2 YEARS OLD BUT IN MOVING THE BOOK WAS MISPLACED OR STILL PACKED SOMEWHERE. WELL IT IS A BOOK THAT YOU SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE IN YOUR REACH,  YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN THERE IS A CHILD THAT NEEDS TO HERE THE WORDS, &#34;LOVE YOU FOREVER.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great game had me hooked couldn't put it down<br /><br />graphics are amazing.  tough mini games added to the thrill of the game.
B007OUINLC|4.0|Keira Knightly really pulls this movie together and gives it a sexual charge.  In addition, the script deals fairly with a very dark and controversial issue between Jung, Freud and a patient of Jung's.  By turns, Jung and Freud are both humiliated and somewhat redeemed.  It reminded me of the film, &#34;When Nietzsche Wept&#34;.  Jung's final line in the movie rings truer and more compassionate than any other film dealing with adultery: &#34;Sometimes a man has to do something un-forgivable just to go on living...&#34;<br /><br />Enter: The creative birth of the wounded physician.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Another amazing book by Nicholas Sparks! Never fails to write a bad book. I have yet to find one I havent liked!
B007XIC1GI|2.0|I liked most of the man behind this book.  I enjoyed the unfettered romp around the US in a drug filled frenzy, but it was hard to get past the shadow writer Neil Strauss who also wrote &#34;The Game&#34; and several articles for Rolling Stone.  Seriously, F*** that guy!  He writes for 8th graders.  Target audience.  And do you know what?  He succeeds at what he does because people don't want originality, depth or intelligence.<br /><br />I'd like to try my hand at a Marilyn Manson Biography with an older and more disillusioned Mr. Manson and really make some people uneasy.  Cut a bit deeper and bring out a more refined hatred for existence.  Perhaps someday...
B005LAIGYQ|4.0|I purchased this for my bf for christmas. We both had never seen it before. I was worried about the first person shooter thing but a few reviews said it was pretty good. So I got it. Great action!
030758836X|5.0|This books is so captivating! It is really two books in one. Great read. Couldn't put it down. Her other books are too dark for me but this one was great.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy playing it but unable to do some things without having diamonds. have to pay to get more. wish easier way to get them besides leveling up.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I had this game on my computer years ago and I liked it.  This was no disappointment, I love card games.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|I thought this was nothing more than the typical case of just vs. unjust case that is the basis of Platonic philosophy. Do we kill people for peace? Is this just? That's what the author wants you to ask yourself by the end of the novel. I'm not one for graphic novels, but this is one I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good read.
B007LE2VDM|5.0|I love Christina Perri and her ballad style pop music is perfect for my long commutes. I particularly like the song &#34;Arms&#34; and &#34;Distance&#34;.  Must hears!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this puzzle app.  I love to do puzzles and this is the best puzzle app i have found.  Its got levels for each level of puzzle enthusiest.
B006P0FIGU|5.0|This movie made my daughter so happy.I had looked out in the mall stores.They were always out.I am glad Amazon had it.That was the only movie she ask for.Pluse it is a good movie to watch with the family.
B002RI9UBS|4.0|This book is beautifully written, a little long in some areas but overall I am very glad I read it
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read<br /> this book or shall I say series twice already and both times I can't put the books down... I recommend this book to all my friends.
B005S9EK1S|5.0|Loved the characters....would love to see mor movies like this.  Looking forward to more movies with the stars in it.
1932100660|5.0|A real eye opening wake up call to all of us in the U.S.! I'm spreading the word far and wide to help save lives & bought numerous copies that I gave to family and friends for Xmas.
B005LAIGTG|5.0|We need more movies like this...loved it!,,,The main characters have great chemistry.  Hope they are together again in another  movie.
B004R6JG7G|5.0|Classic comedy. Val Kilmer and Tom Cruise are so hilarious in this movie. Every cinema-phile should own this movie as part of his collection.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|not a fan of video games. I am actually frustrated at times and evwen more so when my 5 yr. old grandson understands it better than I.
B0016492BW|5.0|Funny. Funny. Funny. Funny. Funny. Classic British comedy troupe. Ahead of its time. Timeless comedy. Granted, not all the skits work, but the vast majority of them do and are HILARIOUS and so memorable and quotable.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|not exactly my cup of tea. It is used more for the grandchildren rather than myself. It serves it's purpose on long drives.
B003VS0CYC|4.0|Me and my buddies loved these movies growing up... with the exception of RoboCop 3. Still, even that movie provides great unintentional comedy. GReat enhancement and special features with the Blu-Ray technology
B0086700CM|5.0|This is an awesome game.  You'll find yourself playing it for hours on end.  My daughter downloaded it and I thought she was crazy.  Then I downloaded it and now it's driving ME crazy.  Highly recommended!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Enjoyed.  Especially interested in PCT life and descriptions. I'm sure everyone has issues to work through and this experience sure was a life changer for Cheryl. Reminds me of a quote \\"Be the heroine of your own life, not the victim.\\" Sorry, I do not know the source for quote.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is an awesome product!  Does everything I need it to and is very user friendly.  Highly recommended.  You need this for your Android!
B00973DDN2|4.0|I have to admit that I when I hear &#34;The Killers&#34;, I still think about the wildly popular hits &#34;Mr. Brightside&#34; and &#34;Somebody Told Me&#34;.  Some of my friends admit that they are disappointed with this album since it doesn't have that &#34;catchy-ness&#34; that their early hits had, and believe that this is actually the antithesis of their original hits. In someways this is true.  If you were a fan of the Day and Age album, then you appreciate the depth that The Killers are capable of delivering and this album follows that up.  Their music reflects the mood of most people; the tracks deal with hardship and struggle and there is very positive energy.  The songs are very meaningful, and the big hit &#34;Runaways&#34; conjures memories of Bruce Springsteen's &#34;The River&#34;.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I've been a fan of Nicholas Sparks books for quite some time, but this book has been by far my favorite. I literally read it in 2 days, I just couldn't put it down. I highly recommended this book to any fans of his and even those who aren't familiar with his work.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|The writing style was so juvenile that it inspired me to write my own novel.. If he can sell this, I should be on the Times Best Seller list by next year.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Since the latest update the app no longer works on my phone. It just force closes. I hope this gets corrected quickly.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book blew my mind. I can usually guess where a story is going after the first few chapters, but this one kept me on my toes.
0345803485|5.0|This book is awesome! its an easy read but thats okay. if you want a tough read, read the books your assigned in college. I had enough of that. I was addicted to this book and didnt know there were 3! The story takes twists and unexpected turns. I felt like i knew the characters. even my husband would say... what would you do if i were christian! yum!
B001VLXNLU|5.0|Awesome book!! I loved it from the second I started reading!! This is going to end up being my favorite series!
B007I2BZIE|3.0|I love Rush and own many of their albums.  This one has some very good tracks on it but overall I'm disappointed.  Its loud which is a good thing.  However, it is noisy and at times hard to listen to, which is not a good thing.  If you're a huge Rush fan, you will like this.  If you're on the fence, stick with their older material.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|Always was a favorite and now I own it! Have the children watching it now hope to have more fans.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I can't figure out how to use this app.  Not very happy with it at all. Wish it could be easier to figure out.
B004ADB17Y|1.0|We loved the idea of downloaded movies and getting one instant without going somewhere. But, the Goonies was mostly dark and very hard to see. My kids couldn't see the picture so they were hard to sit still and they are older than 10. They now hate the Goonies movie. Next time we will plan ahead and visit our local store and buy one and watch it on the tv. Plus the movie was a wide screen style and we couldn't figure how to get it as full screen. If we wanted to listen to a movie we would have bought a book on cd! If you can fix it to show full screen and fix the dark screen we mite rent a one that shows up brighter. But don't hold your breath.
B00APUQJLO|5.0|With Cronenberg at the helm, and a spectacular cast headlined by Robert Pattinson, this film was an ambitious undertaking of a book that few people could accurately summarize. I fully acknowledge that few people will understand the film, and even fewer will enjoy it, but if you are at all familiar with the book you will realize that it was impeccably done. Pattinson is remarkable in a lead role where he is in almost every frame of the film, and one scene at the end with Paul Giamatti in particular is spectacular. Again, not a film for everyone, but I would absolutely recommend it.
B00846REIS|5.0|A lot of similarities to fifty shades but it was a great read. If you like Fifty shades then you will love this book.
B004GYY714|4.0|While the search function seemingly finds a specific station, selecting it to tune into sometimes connects to a totally different station.  Otherwise a nice app.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Just amazing and insightful and completely inspirational. Every sentence is eye opening and real. I loved everything about this book
B006G2124E|5.0|I read the book first then I saw this movie . It did not disappoint. The movie did the book justice.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|i have read all the book in this collection and i love them.  well done by the author capturing his lifr
B0091REZMW|3.0|I love it the game is different and keeps you wanting more I would and will tell everyone I think that will play it to deffinatly play it
B0066WJLU6|4.0|On occasion, I need a light to get to the bathroom. My kindle sits beside my bed and this app is perfect to avoid the dogs, and the various places I can stub my toes. A handy app to have on your phone or tablet.
B0015AARJI|5.0|cant beat the price as opposed to game stop or even wal mart works great and black is the way to go anyway for me
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Great movie for the whole family to watch together for the Christmas season.<br />Good for kids that are wondering if there's a Santa.<br />And we all know there is :-)
B0049P1VHS|5.0|As this was purchased as a gift for my son,<br />I have not seen it myself.  I don't think he<br />has had an  opportunity to watch any of it yet.<br />Item arrived in a timely manner, well before<br />Xmas.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app...does everything I want it to do, in a size that's easy to read! Has some features beyond the basic four functions, which are also handy. No complaints.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I really loved this movie; it tackled the complex issues that plague many long term married couples with a brilliant sense of humor<br />and a perfectly harmonized cast. I would recommend this movie to everyone over 18 years of age, especially married couples. All three main characters were amazing and the scenic shots were breath taking. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|I loved it!! Not the part you expect Ben Affleck to play- but he did a great job! Excellent movie!
0070511136|5.0|This book was not written by a sales person.  So don't read it, if you think the close is the only aspect of sales you want to learn.  Unlike most sales books, Neil Rackham has dissected the entire sales process to determine the gap between average sales calls versus stellar performers by studying over 35 000 sales appointments.  The closing just takes care of itself once you understand what happens with the entire process.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|I was afraid this might be just another version of Glee, but that was not case. It's a highly entertaining musical comedy with just enough sentiment to make you feel for the characters. Anna Kendrick as Beca and Skylar Astin as Jesse were standouts, but Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy steals the show. If you're in the mood for a light-hearted comedy with a great soundtrack, you'll not be disappointed.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|Must read first book in series first! Each one is better than the last!!!! Bones and Cat make a great team!!!
1451695195|5.0|I found this book, written by a doctor, very interesting.  He is admitting that he had heard numerous stories like this from his patients and discounted them as neurological brain phenomenon or the mind trying to comfort itself when faced with death.  After now having been through the experience himself, he is convinced it is true and so do I.
1435106342|5.0|great gift..loved the gilded edges...great gift..loved the gilded edges.....great gift..loved the gilded edges.....great gift..loved the gilded edges....great gift..loved the gilded edges
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|It was a surprise to have seen and absorbed this neat story. I first saw the film and was so intrigued that I decided to purchase a rare DVD (for me), because I think I will learn more and more as I repeatedly view the film. Took me into fantasy land quickly and soon I was cheering for the hero.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is an amazing book. Not only does it give you what most women all desire, but it also has a fantastic story line. I didn't want it to end.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|If you love the LEGO modular building series, then get this!<br /><br />If you are just getting into the modular series, try and snatch up one of the older ones before they go out of print!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Best trilogy ever read. Keeps you captivated at all times. I couldn't put my kindle down. I haven't been this enthralled in a book in awhile.
B001NT9CW4|5.0|Have loved the Moody Blues since 60's.  They had a great run of albums, of which EGBDF was one of best.  Great music from a great group!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Could put it down. So into the book. It was amazing. I really don't like books like this. But I would recommend to other people.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It's an okay book. Lots of sex, I mean lots which is why I think it's so popular. I think as a whole it could have been written better instead of concentrating on the sex scenes. I honestly skipped over a few of those scenes cause it was just too much. I like the story line of a book. For me, the book was okay but the ending made you wonder \\"what's next\\" therefore I bought the 2nd book. Too curious not to know what happened next.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Love this game and can't stop playing it! Recommend it to everyone as it is easy to learn. One of the first games I got for my kindle and still loving it! Also child friendly.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I loved this series so much that I bought it as a gift for my sister.  She loves it too.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very addictive. Absolutely love it. Hooked on it from the first screen. Playing it so much I keep running my batteries down.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|We loved this movie! Great Christmas present for my son!! I was thrilled to find it at such a great price and did most of my shopping this yr on amazon because of the convenience. The movie is so cute - we will all have it memorized before long :)
B005CKPQNE|5.0|From the pilot on I have been totally hooded to this show. These two guys are something else! What a great match up.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|this is a hard read but worth it so make sure you have some time to devote to reading it. it was an odd but very lovely story.
B0083GQKQG|3.0|This was a good movie because it's a true movie in certain ways. I was mad that she didn't do anything really. And to top it off she stuck by him after when I would have ended up putting him out of his misery.
1419705849|5.0|I love that my roommate's niece love this book so much she finished reading the entire book in one day.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I used to think y! mail was great. Even had y! as my home page. Slowly but surely Yahoo has gotten crapier and crapier... and this new y!mail is HORRIBLE.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|This is a great adapter for the price.  I previously tried the Pluggable GbE USB 2.0 adapter that worked well, but for less money this makes a lot more sense with real Gb capability with USB 3.0.  It also uses a newer ASIX chipset than the Pluggable adapter and is a little bit smaller.  Get the latrest drivers from Asix's site.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|I found Pines to be an entertaining if not predictable read. The first half of the book was extremely engaging and absolute 5 star but then it lost momentum as the plot unravelled (pun intended). Definitely worth a read but I disagree with the reviews that say the ending was a knock out.
B009NXV2RK|4.0|This book is real page turner. I would highly recommend the book.I  Can not wait for the next book in the series,
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Very funny movie...great for everyone. It's a great holiday movie...one of my favorites. Kids and grandkids, alike, love this film.
B000002GYG|5.0|Was always a fan of Tom Waits since I heard Small Change for the first time. I would recommend this album to any one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I came into this book completely ignorant of its content. I've never read any reviews or watched  it's movie. Now I will refrain for the movie... I know it won't ever live up to how awesome the book actually is!
B000002GY9|5.0|Aclassic. First album I ever heard of Tom's, became an instant fan. I would recommend this album to anyone who who enjoys the beat generation of 60's Grenwich Village coffee shop poets, snapping your fingers at the end of each song.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game for kids  8 yrs old and above.....you have to set time limits otherwise the kids will keep on playing!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Its a cool app. It lets you access your computer on your tablet. I have nothing bad to say for it
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|We had some problems initially trying to get the sound to work when viewing this movie but after a couple minutes of playing around with the computer we got it to work. After that the movie worked fine and it was quite enjoyable.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|I ordered this for my husband for Christmas and he watched the DVD Christmas Eve night! He loves it - it was so worth it!! Fast delivery and a very reasonable price. I highly recommned for Zeppelin fans
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Love the music, the design, the sounds and the puzzles!  You learn to solve each puzzle, as you go along. I find this game challenging as well, as entertaining.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Too much profane language (every other word was the \\"F\\" word.)  A waste of money.  I would not recommend it.  It is a sad reflection about our culture that this movie has received any positive attention.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book had a lot of twists and turns. I changed my mind several times. It kept my attention, and I was shocked more than once. Not really sure I liked the ending.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|The music that is on the DVD there are excellent, good set on sons , clear dvd production and you can trust the seller
B008M721MS|5.0|good product great works great glad I got it<br /><br />love ordering things with this web site I have never had a problem with them
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|When my mind is too busy, this game gives that quick get away.... I mean my children LOVE it :)
B008P9M614|5.0|Love the House, MD series. My wife and I are lovely all the season. We are addicitive to the show. Sad part is they ended the show earlier this year.
075669812X|5.0|I gave this to my 9 year old son for Christmas and he loves it.  We're getting ready to head out for a 4 hour car ride and i'm sure this will keep him occupied most of the way.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is is AMAZAYN FABULOUIS EXTRODINHARRY PHENOMINIALL AND BRILLIAM I in love with one direction so with this app I can watch them ALL THE TIME!!!!!!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Just got this for Christmas and so far it's working our great.  Purple is my favorite color and it protects the kindle great.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this on my phone and my Kindle Fire.  We have the Internet in our church and using this bible, I have no problems following the different bible passages used in the church service.
0670023329|4.0|This book tells the story of the only person known to have been born in a North Korean political prison camp to have escaped.  From the aspect of someone born in a bubble the author tell his story well.  The book was almost like reading a good and lengthy investigative report that taught the reader quite a bit about life in such a camp.  If you're looking for such information and seek to reflect on why the world isn't doing much about this situation read it.  If you're looking for a book to read while relaxing perhaps you should look for something lighter.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Now I can hardly wait for HBO to start the second season. I was disappointed that the fifth book ended the series. This was a story that could have gone on and on.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I have played Snark Busters for PC before, and was delighted that the app for Kindle Fire was every bit as beautifully done as the original. Quirky steampunk style meets a fast and challenging combination of hidden object and puzzle challenges.
B0000669JL|5.0|Bought as a gift for my 11 year old son. He was very excited to recieve it. He has listened to it several times and says it deserves 5 stars. Shipping was very fast.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It is a great way to get the best gossip in middle school and is funny for me yo read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book I wish it never ends but it has to and I'm so sad and I love the movies to
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I got this because we wanted to see what the Blu-ray version looked like, and because my kids could watch this over and over again all day long.  There is actually more stuff in this set than I will ever be interested in--I am not big on watching interviews and documentaries about the making of movies.  Nonetheless, it is very nicely packaged (oh, and pretty big--about the size of a coffee table book and 4 inches thick) but will take up a lot of room on your video shelf...if it even fits!  It did come over-packed though, because it came in a very sturdy shipping box which Amazon in turn put into another shipping box to mail it to me.  Oh well.  Still a super nice addition to the collection and I have loved this movie since I was a kid.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is well written and thought-provoking. I loved it! Definitely recommended and the rest of the series is equally wonderful.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 8 yr old loves this game.  Playing only creative mode, it is a limitless online Legoland.  It truly gives the ability to create limitless possibilities
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Finally!  The creators of Angry Birds go into the pigs world as the piggies try to steal the birds eggs.  Just get this version because it has very few ads and all the levels!  Don't waste any more time!! Get Bad Piggies today!!!!!
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|Great family fun. Safe for all ages.  Nothing offensive in wardrobe, language, or plot. truly a safe family fun movie.
159420411X|3.0|by the reputation of the author. Now that I've finished the book.<br />And reflected.<br /><br />With so much emphasis on Bayesian thinking<br />I wish he would have spent a few pages<br />explaining its derivation. It cost him another star.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|This movie is a family friendly classic !  I recommend it to all ages as a fun movie night choice.
0321344758|5.0|This is a great book for anyone who has never had any previous experience in UI, quality assurance or other testing. If you've previously worked in a testing environment, much of this book will be review for you or will cover things that probably come naturally. It is still worthwhile as a review but you won't find much in the way of revolutionary ideas.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|This series is bound to be a classic for every history/drama/dry comedy fan on your gift list!  Or, Keep it for yourself!
0007447868|3.0|I enjoyed reading the first 3, but this book I was getting bored. Everyone can die and be brought back to life, so what is the point with the Others.  The author seems like to lengthen the series.  Not sure if it's money wise
630587493X|5.0|Robin Williams plays the part of a family robot.  He is a servant, but he is more than that.  He has feelings and abilities.  He is learning how to be human, but finds out it isn't easy.  When technology finally allows him to be human and he finds the woman of his dreams, some things go wrong for him.  He is only moments away from his dream in the end.
0553801473|2.0|Book 4 and 5 are boring...my thought..read Kate Morris's review.  It is an excellent review. The author seems to let his imagination run wild as the story goes..all the characters are jokes now
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a lot like temple run witch is also  great !!!!!!!!! Its also fun to do compete with your friends!!!!!!!! So I say get the app and it is also free so why not?
B00979CS50|5.0|I got to see this music live in October at New Orleans' Voodoo fest and that show was just named the top performance of the year by the newspaper's music critics.  Neil takes the Crazy Horse band to its most basic and profound elemental form.  Long, crunching and transcendent pieces that deliver their concepts in the same voice as the aging star's autobiography.  A stream of consciousness musing in fragments about the past and present.  Powerful.  Requires large speakers.
B008J9EYFG|5.0|Seasoned song writer, great tunes, easy listening. Not a bad track in this or any other of her work. Check out her website.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|One of our grandsons favorite movies. Lots of humor and action, and adults can enjoy it too. It also makes you think about our throw-away society, and how you should recycle as much as you can.
B007NESBK2|5.0|For anyone who waited ten years for Sade to return to performing and got to see her live. This is an excellent way to relive the experience and get a lot of back story.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I am a fan of Men in Black.  I find it is interesting that there could be some truth to the movie contents.  I thught the first series was 5 stars.  I still enjoy watching the original Men in Black.  This one has a suprising twist at the end that took me by complete surprise. I also like the time travel thoroughness.  But why I couldn't give it  5 Star because a lot ot it was the same old action and characters.  I hope this series continues.  If you like the original Men in Black, you will like this one.
B0035JRVR8|5.0|Just what my wife wanted!, Don't have anything else to say, except that this is what my wife wanted, so I bought it.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Mark Wahlberg is always good. Good pairing with Mila Kunis.  A little too much gratutious bad language. But story was enjoyable.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|When I started this book I did not expect anything. This beautiful book is a page turner and it broke my heart. Everyone should read it!
0316069434|5.0|Love Michael Connelly books. Glad there is another one out and the Harry Bosch Series is the best. Great Christmas gift.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great graphics, storyline and character development. You can play for yours. Suspenseful scary adventure,all that you would hope for to keep you entertained
B000VZP6LC|5.0|I have only watched the pilot episode of this series but it looks really good. I have heard many good things about this series and Dylan McDermott is a great actor.
B008LZHA3G|3.0|I confess to a long-time predilection for Dylan and his significant musical attitudes. I first encountered him in Dinky Town near the University of Minnesota campus in a previous century. We were both a whole lot younger then. Dylan went on to a varied and highly successful musical career that more often than not, pushed the envelope. I just went on.<br /><br />Voices change over time and so do attitudes and it's my opinion that when one's performing voice quality deteriorates to painful levels, one ought to stop performing. There are many younger more vigorous voices eager to take up the torch and carry on with his themes and his writing skills are as strong as ever.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Great movie. This was my first streamed movie and it worked out just fine. Just make sure you have a good wired or wireless connection to stream HD movies.
145162607X|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for someone. They loved it, which was not a surprise, since it was on their wish list.
0525952926|3.0|Absolutely LOVED the first of Trilogy but wasn't that thrilled over this second  one.<br /><br />Perhaps that period too familiar to me so no big surprises.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|First the bluray, the boxing is great, lots of special features, 4 disc for every viewing experience.<br />Now for the movie, it is a great movie, for all of you haters this is a good movie that lives up to the alien franchise until aliens 3 and yes i do believe aliens 3 is a good movie though not lile the first two. How ever i think the movie fails in trying to sell you that it is not prequel, but believe me, it is a prequel mo matter how many times ripley says no. Because of this they changeg many thins so that it wouldnt connect directly to alien, i believe that if they made it a direct sequel it wouldve been more enjoyable. Overall this movie is great
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All three books were wonderful this is actually my third time reading the series and I find something new each time. I regretted what happened to Prim. But otherwise best books I've read in a while
B00003CX95|5.0|What else can I say, it's Braveheart? :-) A great story, well told.<br /><br />&#34;I'm so afraid. Give me the strength to die well.&#34; - William Wallace.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|A lot of excellent short stories. Some NOT so excellent. No real ending to speak of. Alice in headland is better
B00005JKDR|5.0|Can't wait for part two! My 4yr old son and I both like this movie. It was very imaginative and creative, with a great ending. I think maybe he would have liked it more if there was some singing in it, but I thought it was great.
B005D0TETK|5.0|i gave it 5 stars becuuse it is good quality. I would recomend this to anyone who likes Columbia fleece items. the quality is almost as good but the price is lower
B003DT19F0|5.0|My son loves her movies and so do I! I loved Vidian in here! We love the songs too. I thought this was a great story and great in showing how they all stuck together! I wish there was more background on the father daughter relationship because to me the daughters pleading seemed unwarranted.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I was worried that Season 2 wouldn't be as good as Season 1 but I was totally wrong.  This is a fabulous show.
B004G600A4|5.0|Great spin on the story. Loved the strong girl taking charge!!! My son (4yrs old) liked the movie, thats why we bought it and I thought Mandy Moore did a great job! So did the artist! Cool ending. This will be a classic.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|I saw the previews for this show and thought it might be a cool show to watch.  I downloaded all the available episodes and am totally hooked.
B00005JNS0|3.0|I thought this movie sucked and was boring! I took my nephew and niece to the show to see it when it first came out and found myself in the hallway just to get away from this awful movie. But my 4yr old son likes this movie! I enjoy many of the movies I buy him and find it great when we can watch a movie together (he always wants the company). Guess you can’t win them all.
B00005N6KG|4.0|These are great for those of us who still like to keep headphones around our necks when we're not using them (and avoid the crazy tangled knots of earbuds). I got these for exercising and, while staying put, they can get in the way during an intense workout. Overall, the light weight is awesome and the sound quality is good for the price.
B000MV9026|4.0|I really liked this movie. I watched it before my son was born with his father (who recommended it and had seen it before), and again this year when my son was four. My son only watched it once so I guess he didn't care for it that much. So, 2 out of 3 (maybe adults will enjoy it more?).
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Yes, the movie is crude, but at the heart of it it is charming. But then I'm a huge Seth McFarland fan. If you hate anything Seth, don't watch this. If you like his stuff, you'll probably like it.
0345803485|3.0|I could only get a little over halfway through, so my review is based on that. I kept hearing about this book, so I bought it. I have to say Grey's personality comes off to me as very dull and unlikable (which my opinion has nothing to do with his sexual desires). I was not impressed by anything that happened. It seemed I always knew where the story was going. To me, Ana was a smart girl that made very poor decisions. I stopped reading because I just could not stomach any more of their behavior! I don't know how to explain my views anymore without giving away the story.
B0039P1O4O|1.0|It didn't work at all so I returned it.<br /><br />Why do I have to type too many words to complete a review
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Loved the moral of the story, Horton and the Mayor sticking up for what they know is right and what they believe in despite an overwhelming outer influence to give up (which they never do)!...and the father trying relentlessly to connect to his son. Great settings, loved the world of the Who's and the characters in the jungle. My son likes the movie too(4yrs old), thinks it's funny.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Stayed up all night reading this. I just couldn't put it down. I never write reviews but this one deserved it. Great job!
B0034JKZ86|4.0|I like this movie and my 4yr old has watched it maybe 25 times! I love the work ethic Tiana has, also how she influences the prince and goes after her dreams. I like the jazz playing and the New Orleans setting and hope it will bring more tourism back to Louisiana. I think this movie could have been so much better if it was done in brighter colors. After seeing all the recent movies in CGI it felt a little out of date. I wish Tiana had more airtime as herself and not the frog and I wish she had more songs to herself.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Took forever to read however enjoyed the end much more than beginning<br /> I can see Bruce Willis playing the part of John Corey
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My son is four, he loves it and so do I. We like the music and the story. Blue is funny and I loved rooting for him! I loved the settings (it should have been nominated for an Academy Award). I hope they have a part two!
B00355L2TU|4.0|You will definitely feel this 20 minute workout if your a beginner to intermediate. As usual her workouts are intense.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|i love this game! i feel like this game really challenges me. it requires skill on my part. i love it
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This worked perfect for my daughter's Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;.  She was most excited that the case was able to hold her Kindle upright.
B003UESJHO|3.0|I understand movies have swearing but I am not fond of the F word and this was used quite a few times
1419705849|5.0|My 10 year old son had been waiting to read this book...he received it for Christmas, sat down and read the whole book by the end of the day.  I'd say it was well received!
B004EPYZPS|3.0|It was not a favorite, after we finished watching it they all looked at me saying that I just wasted their time. It was alright but not as good as I was hoping for. No, I would not buy this movie again
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I love the Kindle Fire... it is easy to use and I can do many things with it.  I'm still enjoying my Kindle also...  Thanks.<br />Jean
B004EPYZP8|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, it is a movie that I will watch several times. I like how lawyers can figure out how to turn things around
B0086700CM|5.0|love the game! the only problem is it is very addictive. I find myself saying &quot;just one more time&quot; and before I know it a half an hour as gone by!
B002ZG999U|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. A Lot of action and no F bombs, these are how movies should be made. I know that some action movies work better with serious swear words but it is not my favorites. I hate that word and I base my movies and if I can stand listening to the movie as I watch it.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Not his greatest but better than most anybody else.  His average is better than most peoples best.  You will like it, I promise.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This movie was my very favorite. How a man struggles to make it in this world and how he did it with his son. Anything is possible if you really strive to make it come true.
0345529057|1.0|I started reading this series when they started showing it on TV.  Books 1-3 gave a lot of background that was skipped over in the TV series. The plot lines from the book were combined to fit inside the time restraints for the movies. Now for Book 4. WHAT A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME. George goes off in these tangents that have nothing to do with the main characters. Adding more characters after killing off other characters is a common plot element, but these substories do not add anything to the original plot line. What a snooze to read this book. If you are buying the set fine. Here is a hint. When you get to book 4 just read the last 4 chapters because at this point, FINALLY, you are back where you left off from Book 3.  Warning, Book 5 is NOT any better.
B004EBT5CU|2.0|That is all this CD is good for, the three songs you hear on the radio non stop! I thought she would have more, but nope, there is a reason why they don't play them, ugh!
0553801473|1.0|The 5th book in this series is as boring and a slog to read as was Book 4. Enough already, just get to the end so I can know who survives and who wins the war. Books 1-3 were well written, and this is NOT a 10 book Harry Potter series. It has taken me to SKIMMING through 70% of the book just to get to find out what is going on with the Character Cercei. The subplot for Tyrion and Jorah was UNNEEDED, UNNECESSARY, and should did not do anything to improve this book. George, PLEASE, if you read these reviews, stop writing already and get to the end.  If you do not mind paying for this book, you could just read the last 4 chapters.  I understand there is a Book 6 coming. At this point, I will wait until the LAST book to buy another one.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|don't think its thick enough to protect the pad and its difficult to get it propped upon itself and use it
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Thought we would give this game a try,have not been able to put it down since the download!  FUN!  Will be purchasing the ad free version.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Beautiful love story; a bit predictable but very entertaining. The story was simple, and easy to read. I enjoyed the plot.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|It's a great case for the price. Slim, slightly grippy, with enough protection to keep my phone safe when/if I drop it. I will probably buy more colors.
1469220652|5.0|The crossfire series is excellent! I highly recommend it. The reader, Jill Redfield, captures Gideon's voice perfectly. The best reading I have ever heard. Sylvia Day needs to use her more often. With her writing and Jill's reading they are the dream team!
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Awesome!  I have no idea why the other ratings are so low.  Maybe they are from people that aren't into action sci fi.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|A great way to get all The Beatles albums at one time. Too often one only hears the more famous hits of The Beatles; but nearly all of their songs were very good. Happy to have purchased it.
0375507256|2.0|Hubby dragged me to the movies to see this.  I hope the book is better than the movie.  Hubby appreciated the gift.
B0013ND30W|5.0|A genuine classic whose story is timeless. Now in high-quality Blu-ray, it is incredibly entertaining for both young & old. For a Disney-phile, this is a &#34;must-have.&#34;
B004ZWKWQQ|4.0|My son says he thinks that the solid booster rockets need more support.  At the top of the booster rockets, they pop off too easily.
B00070DK1E|5.0|A great album that showcases the very complex harmonies of Jethro Tull. It is a great addition to the collection of any Tull enthusiast. Delivery was very quick.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is the best book I have  ever read. I rated it five stars because it was utterly amazing. The end.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This book had some nice quotes and wisdom which I loved. Makes you really think about the importance of living life and not being so time obsessed like so many people are
B006P96PAO|5.0|This movie has all the elements of drama, humor, and the perfect message.  A must see for all men if you are willing to be courageous!
B0084B5TK8|5.0|This was my first book purchase, a paperback in 1958 or so.  Reading it again all these years later is still enjoyable.
B008S4YZCO|4.0|I'm having lots of fun playing this with my little boy.<br />We haven't put it down since we downloaded it a few hours ago.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My dd says &quot;this is the BEST game ever!!&quot; Thanks for such a super fun app that rewards generously and keeps little attention's for hours!
B006LSZECO|5.0|To be quite honest, The purchase of this book was an accident...lol, but when I started reading it I was pleasantly surprised at how good it is. There is however 1 downfall. It jumps around a lot, going back and forth in time. I am one of those people who don't like that but, with this book there is a reason for this madness...lol. I would HIGHLY recommend this book. I am not finished with it yet but , had it not been the holiday season it would have been finished in 2 days....A super read.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|Was part of a complete pack I dared. Delivery was fine.<br />Unfortunately I screwed it up installing win 8... And also there are pretty few applications that take advantage of 64 bits and of the 8 cores.<br />Even so I'm a believer.
1451695187|2.0|I am just not sure what to believe about this story..........it sounds too much like a fantasy to me.....just not sure!
B000002GB6|5.0|I used to have this on either an album or a cassette tape back in the late 80's or 90's but hadn't heard it in years. Sure is nice to hear these tunes again!
B008BDZOXQ|5.0|Album of the year. Came fast and in perfect condition. the vinyl is the way to go with the included digital download!
B006ZS4G24|5.0|I bought these for a granddaughter who loves to build.  She spent several hours putting it together and playing with it.  Great gift for young gals.  She is six.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|This is the first time I listened music from Lana Del Rey. I was hesitant to buy the album that I have not heard about the songstress. I was delightly surprised by the musical quality and will listen very often.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|Love the size and flexibility.  It holds up and maintains it shape.  I use it often and has stood the test of time!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|This is my favorite Muse album and probably my favorite record of all time. To me, this album catches Muse at the apex of their musical and creative ability. Unfortunately, it's been a steady decline after this album, although I will always see Bellamy and crew as absolute geniuses.<br /><br />This album explores such a vast amount of emotional ideas through a varied yet consistent musical approach. It's clear that the entire band takes music very seriously, and there are no limits as to where the band pulls their influences from. As someone who appreciates classical music, it was so refreshing for me to hear the classical style arpeggios that flutter throughout Apocalypse. And the thundering piano chords at the end of Ruled by Secrecy. This album has it all, and it deserves an attentive listen.
B007MU85D0|5.0|A wonderful listen, both sounds and lyrics. Worth your time and money. I suggest you sit back and listen and you'll be sure enjoy.
B000WC4A8O|5.0|Superb packaging, individual records have their own sleeves and comes with a large booklet.  The records are beautiful 180 gram's and sound awesome, highly recommended!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|what cute games all wrapped into one!!......your mind and your time will be pre-occupied........be sure to tell your friends...I haven't learner all the levels yet..but I'm getting there....lol.....Enjoy!!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Season one was great season two is a bit too much soap opera. The Mr. Bates scenario and the lady Sybil love affair belong on As. The World Turns
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Just brought on Christmas and haven't really played with it. What I did do with it I liked. Need more play.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|now the whole story comes together of why he is who he is.  Feelings get involved and it becomes a true kinky love Story.<br />All 2 together make sense.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite books!  Favorite scene?  When Agnes has hid all the roofing nails and gunpowder under her skirts! Laughed out loud!  The many scenes of precognition were awesome, too!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This was about an innocent girl meeting her first &#34;Love&#34;. except he was into S&L.  The language was really dirty, however I finished it though not wanting to. Then I decided to give the next book a chance.
B000F8O35U|5.0|It is a children's classic.  My girls loved it.  The animation is what is expected of Disney.  A fun and visually rich movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|it comes together, the language changes some and the woman has more control of where the relationship is going. Love changes it.
B00005JMAH|5.0|The third installment of the Harry Potter series.  A good video following Harry's third year at Hogwarts.  There is more suspense and surprises in store for those who watch it.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is addictive, challenging and super fun. It was easy to learn yet very challenging. Hours of entertainment. Great game.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|The story continues on several years later, bringing the brothers back.  It is well done, with a lot of action and bits of comedy thrown in.
B004INNRFK|3.0|This CD and DVD are good, but not as dynamic as the first one. Maybe I was expecting too much, since the original Hit Man was stupendous.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I have enjoyed reading Tom Clancy since Hunt for Red October. This book while fiction makes on wonder, could this scenario be possible? In the age of advanced technology You have too think that some one is trying to develop programs to raise havoc in the world.
0307744434|5.0|I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE THAT LIKES THEIR BOOKS KIND OF ON THE STRANGE AND UNUSUAL SIDE. YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO THINK OUT OF THE BOX IN OTHER WORDS
B000SEGUDE|4.0|A novel that's structured like a Russian doll - one story inside the next.  Each is well crafted and absorbing.  However, they have an extremely tenuous connection with each other, and could function just as easily as 6 discrete short stories.  Overall, I was entertained.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|this was  a limited edition. I gave it to my mom and she loved it.  there was things in the book she read that she never knew about the movie which she said she loved.  it also shipped very quickly.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've read quite a few reviews for this book and most of them had.  I think too many people were looking for some deep meaning in this.  It's not there.  However, it does give an escape into a world most of us won't ever experience.  I like to escape to a different world when I read and this book provides just that.
B008N1LL42|1.0|...is that the evil aliens look like Tom Waits on a three-week bender.<br /><br />Seriously, how is it possible to spend $290 million and make something this awful?  For that amount of money, the CGI should at least be awesome, but it isn't - everything is blurry and out of focus.<br /><br />I knew I would hate this film.  I just didn't know I would hate it this much.  When the best thing about a movie is Rihanna, you know you're in epic fail territory.
0061122416|5.0|My brother gave this book to me YEARS ago, and I never got around to reading it until a few months ago, and I'm glad I finally did. I packed it for a flight, thinking it would help me kill a little bit of time, but once I started reading, I didn't put the book down and finished it in a few hours. It's a suspenseful story, and I was constantly wondering what would happen next. It is not too complicated, but you get attached to some of the characters. The book talks about omens, so beware, when you're finished with it, you will will suddenly start to wonder, \\"Is that an omen? Was THAT an omen?\\"
B003Y5H5HO|1.0|We had to return it.  It was a bootleg copy on a Sony DVD with the title written on the DVD with a black magic marker.  It didn't even play correctly as it had two spots where it stopped playing momentarily.
B005HSL626|4.0|This is a good game.  I downloaded it for my grandson and he really likes it.  Plays it all the time.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a way to keep in touch with classmates and long distance friends. This is my weekend party sign up guys!
034580404X|3.0|The story reads like a young girl wrote it. Good story but drawn out way too much. Book one drags on but once you get to book two It picks up and starts to get interesting. I feel very sorry for Mr. Gray, such a sad man. Book three Wow!Can't understand what all the hype was about. Poorly written yes but a great story.
1401223176|5.0|One of the most visually beautiful books I've ever seen.<br /><br />I found myself staring at each page for more than a normal amount of time because the artwork just owns.<br /><br />One of the best Batman stories on top of some of the best penciling, inking and coloring ever.<br /><br />Read. This. Book.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|A good read for the Christmas holidays. A little wordy at times though but that's expected with the period it was written in. It definitely gives you a glimpse into 19th century London and how tough life was.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great, great movie. Honestly, I didn't expect to love it this much. I highly recommend it to everyone. The soundtrack is also amazing.
141659521X|4.0|It is always fun to keep up with the adventures of Mitch Rapp. A book that is very hard to put down.
0525953728|5.0|Initially due to budget issues I was going to borrow this book from the library.  After all the hoopla learning the charities were not going to take the donations and comments from SEALS like froggy, I decided to purchase the book.  It was much better than I thought it would be, a heck of a lot better than other SEAL stories I have read, a few of them I couldn't bother to finish.  Those guys were looking for a fast buck trying to cash in on the popularity of our SEAL teams.  There is one guy in particular that I am thinking of.  Makes me sick, who in the hell does he think he is when he did the very thing he has accused Mr. Owen of doing?  It had crossed my mind to send the charities a check for $00.00 dollars and decided I didn't want to waste a stamp.  That whole thing disgusts me.<br /><br />I am grateful that I got to read a first hand account before I leave this world.  Had someone waited for 20 years I would most likely be dead and never know the truth.  I found nothing in the book giving away OPSEC, nor did I read a lot of arrogance or bragging.  What I did read was what I would call  confidence for a SEAL, simply describing the situation with what is needed and what it takes to make a mission work and be successful.  Personally, I found Mr. Owen humble, especially on 60 Minutes.  I do question him leaving his sleeves rolled up and his tats showing on Nat'l TV.  Often books written by lay people w/the help of a professional writer are not the greatest of reads, I thought they did a great job w/this story.  It held my attention so that I read it quickly as opposed to dragging it out to a week or more like I do w/some books.<br /><br />I found it exciting, interesting, historical, and most of all I felt like I was getting an honest perspective.  Nice job on translating and giving military explanations that some civilians might not understand or are new to reading military books.  I also felt a personal attachment to the author and that is unusual for me.  I still think of him often, his story has stayed w/me.  Only a handful of books can I say the same.  Dakota Meyer's story is one that comes to mind, Sean Parnell is another.  The Triple Agent was another story important to me, I know someone that was there when it happened.  I am hoping and praying Jake Tapper does justice in the Outpost, another military battle where I want the truth.<br /><br />I understand how some could feel the betrayal, but our world has changed since the old days when there was a different sense of pride, love of country, and tradition in the military.  Those days sadly are long gone.  I know my father rolls over in his grave w/some of what the military is doing today.  I find it bothersome that the so called \\"brotherhood\\" of the SEALS could turn so quickly on a fellow SEAL.  It has really made me lose respect for them and I no longer hold them in such high esteem which is heart breaking for me.  If anything they should be showing their fury to the media that had zero respect for this hero and his safety.  Their anger is so misplaced in my opinion.  Had the book been able to remain anonymous perhaps there would be far less judgment and nastiness and a little more respect?  We will never know.<br /><br />I wish Mr. Owen the best and I hope he has found the peace he deserves and is enjoying life in safety.  After so many deployments and the hell he has gotten for writing his story, he deserves a break in more ways than one.  I am not one to be big on autographs but I would love my book signed and to be able to shake Mr. Own's hand to thank him for his service. I appreciate him telling us about one of the most important American military missions that I will ever know about in my lifetime.  Now if only we could get the truth about 8/6/2011 and Benghazi.  Two other stories I would love to know the truth about now and not in 25 years.

B00APUQPX6|4.0|Enjoyed this as much as previous Ice Age movies, animation is good and plenty of laughs, looking forward to the next one.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|selleck is great; would prefer a PG version. Stories are original and interesting.<br />Seven more words: well scripted, witty, and different

B007QPFGJW|3.0|This is not Nesbo's best.  Story line not as interesting as early novels. Disappointing ending to series. Sorry to lose such a great character.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|I'm a huge Meryl Streep fan so I'm willing to watch anything she puts out, but I didn't really enjoy the movie.  Pretty anticlimactic.
B006INDS0W|4.0|Have not yet seen it, expect I will soon, this was a gift to a friend.  So far as they have said, they loved the movie ! ! !
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Enjoyed it very much. Enjoyed the movie more but the sound track is excellent. . .. . . . .
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Great twists and turns. GILLIAN is an engaging story teller.<br />And always leaves me wanting more. Very thought provoking quotes.
B000067J1Y|5.0|This is a GREAT comedy. So many visual gas, one liners and ridiculous sequences. If you're into comedy, watch this movie.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Loved it! Great for any superhero fan! very Batman in nature. Takes a lot of cues from Smallville but starts the story of  Green Arrow from scratch.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Just finished reading Waking Dreams Immortal Memories-I really enjoyed the collections of the stories. \\"The Fairy Red\\" love story and \\"So Long But Not Goodbye\\"' The writing makes you feel what the characters felt. The tales let the Immortals tell their story. Also The Waking Dreams gives the concept of how we live in the world that we create with our own reality.
B001VIMCW4|2.0|We downloaded Quantum of Solace to watch over the holiday. I hadn't watched a James Bond movie for a while. I must say that this movie paled in comparison to the Sean Connery versions. The suave debonair Mr. Bond was part of the allure of the original shows. Quite lacking with the new Mr Bond.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This is a short and sweet guide that walks you through the process of preparing and uploading your manuscript for Kindle.  No techno- babble or confusing information you don't need. If you can use Word, you can publish on Amazon.  This guide makes it just that easy!
0547884591|4.0|I get that Tim Ferriss is know for the &#34;4-Hour&#34; series, but buyers just need to know that the book is not all about cooking.  There is a lot of great information in this book!  One thing that I had been looking for that this book has is a chart of spice combinations that you can add to any dish to flavor it like a certain cuisine (Japanese, Mexican, Thai, etc.).  Brilliant!  I definitely think that this book is worth buying.
B009R9WAZ8|2.0|Just dd not like the rap and raunchiness. Rihanna is always on the edge which is a main reason why I like her, but this one is too much... too street.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Mark Walberg has kids? I get it is rated R, but crude is an understatement.  A movie that could have been funny but was vulgar just to be vulgar makes the viewing experience not worth your time.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This will be a great game for my grandsons to enjoy.  I have played it myself and it can be addicting.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is a very pretty game with nice challenging puzzles. Hints if you need them and otherwise not so hard you will get frustrated.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|Great game, it runs really smooth on my Kindle Fire and it's a fun game to play. However, compared to the phone version, it's really outdated. It needs the Dragon's Lair, being able to actually use the multiplayer feature, and some other minor updates, like upgrading the Elements.
B005UDD1R6|3.0|Works fine. Nothing special. Price was cheap enough. These things are cheap enough to make casual stocking stuffers. Big Lots often has better deals.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|This book is a well written story of the real life of Steve Jobs.  It is a &#34;no holds barred&#34; narrative of the evolution of Steve Jobs and the product lines he birthed, nurtured, and brought to our lives.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|It appeals to all ages, it's funny, and tells a good story. Graphics are great! Grandsanta is the best character:)
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Okay, if someone would have told me that I would be totally hooked on a Zombie show, I would have laughed.  I actually poked fun at the idea until I watched the 1st episode, after which I was HOOKED. My 21 year old son actually convinced me to watch The Walking Dead and now I am a diehard fan.  The characters are complex, the storyline surprising, and the Zombie action not for young eyes and ears.  It is gory..... but once you get past the gore... you cannot wait until the next episode. If nothing else I know everything I need to know about how to survive a Zombie Apocalypse LOL
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I found World of Goo to be a lot of fun.  The story line and challenges are very creative and the game play is good.  Nice graphics, too.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I have not been impressed with the Facebook app for the Kindle Fire since I first downloaded it for my original Kindle Fire.  It does not update frequently and only displays the last few posts on my newsfeed. I feel that this app really needs some work if it is going to compare with Facebook apps for other tablets/devices.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Awesome buy, definitely will be beneficial for deployments. Warning to those using an XBOX, make sure its not set to auto configure the audio/video settings or it won't work right. It took me half an hour to figure it out.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I decided to get a new controller because my old 2 controllers started to get a little play in the joysticks.  This controller was much smoother and it plays well.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Excellent plot concept..keeps you reading.....and then...the last page makes you feel like there are missing pages. I've never been so frustrated.  In other words the ending \\"sucked\\".  Is there a sequel?  If it was not an e-book, I would have tossted it out the window.  I won't read any other books by this author, I can't take another let down.
078322737X|5.0|This is a great movie for rodders and street rodders it will take you back to the good times as teenagers and thier rods and the time fun that it was cruisin main street down town.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Thank  you. My main concern always is if the item will arrive on time & it did. Haven't had time to watch much...only have seen 3 episodes so I don't know if the DVDs are sratched or anything like that.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|I have always loven this story. Seeing the play or watching the movie are great but reading the novel allows more imagination. Everyone should read this!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|These aren't classically trained opera voices, but they are gritty, emotional and beautiful all at the same time. Nothing could be more fitting for Les Miserables.

B006BDHAX0|5.0|Terrific- having fun all the time with this game - would highly recommend.  Lots of variations available to play around with.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am so happy that there is a Facebook application for kindle fire! I don't know what to do with out it.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Everyone knows this film by heart just about, but this edition is a great version that is truly a collector's edition in every sense.<br /><br />This has both B&W and color versions, and the colorized is impressive in how good it looks.  The B&W version is also great looking.<br /><br />The extras are nice, but the main reason to get this is the quality of the movie.  Maybe since I am  used to seeing it so often in B&W when growing upp on television that the B&W has a certain emotional appeal to me, though I am now watching both every year around Christmas time.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is pretty addicting but its lots of fun. it is a free game play and u can advancein this game for free. and for those who are not retarted all u have to do to exit the game is go to my stuff and the home bar will return to the screen
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I chose 5 stars because I love the book. I like everything about it. It was so interesting and kept me reading. I recommend this book to anybody and diary of a wimpy kid book lovers.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book ever it has romance and violence etc.<br />YOU HAVE TO READ IT!!!!!!!!<br />My favorite book of all time!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I chose to consider this book a four star because this book is incredibly thoughtful and beautiful. The characters make  you feel as much as they do. Charlie's wish for happiness towards himself and others is beautifully written. The emotions that this book conveys makes you remember the innocent and vulnerable person that you once were when youth was the only importance.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved the book! Really pulls the reader in. I would say the book is more for girls though. It took me maybe a day to read it.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book was a great continuation of Camp Half blood. I enjoyed it very much. One of the best books I've ever read.
6305212112|5.0|My wife loves this movie and wanted me to purchase it to be part of our DVD library.  We have watched it a number of times and never fail to enjoy it.
030758836X|5.0|This great little thriller will never win a Big Book Award, but it entertains right down to the last page. It is best saved for those places where time passes slowly, the magazines are lousy and that copy of War and Peace you brought along just doesn't beckon. Gone Girl is clever enough to carry you right away from that middle coach seat you're in, the one by the lav, even when the occupant of the seat in front of you snaps his seat back into your knees, and the single remaining meal choice remaining is fish.<br /><br />M. Feldman
B001OGWY1W|5.0|I regard this as the weakest of the Trilogy, but had to have the complete set.  Bale is without a doubt the best Batman.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The plot device seemed clever but really didn't hold together and it was impossible to care about any if the characters.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|This was my favorite Mission Impossible.  It was action packed from the beginning to the end.  It also had a great cast.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|First the obligatory qualifications.  Rush is my favourite group, hands down.  I have most of their studio albums, five of their live DVD sets, and have seen them twice in concert, once back in the mid 80s while I was in college, and again in 2008 for their Snakes & Arrows tour.  So when I learned they had a new album out, I bought it immediately.<br /><br />The first listen was an utter disappointment.  I couldn't believe how bad this album was.  It seemed \\"over produced\\" to me if that makes sense.  Too much noise.  Too many songs that didn't have a consistent melody.  There was not one track that jumped out at me as an instant classic (something like \\"Dreamline\\" did the first time I listened to `Roll the Bones').  I was deeply disappointed.<br /><br />\\"But this is Rush, and these three guys are virtuosos, so they couldn't have made that bad of a mistake,\\" I thought to myself.  \\"Before rushing to judgment, let me give it a month of listening to the album.\\"  So I've listened to it about a dozen times since, and here's my review.<br /><br />It grows on you.  I don't care about whether or not this is a good \\"concept\\" album.  I've read the lyrics in the little booklet that came with the CD and there is a general story to follow.  As long as the tracks are solid, that's all that really concerns me.<br /><br />I'm still not thrilled with some of the tracks.  Track 10, \\"BU2B2,\\" the reappraisal of track 2, \\"BU2B,\\" is a throwaway.  I never did like it when a band would do something like this, go back to an earlier track on the same album and do something offbeat with it.  At 1:27, this track is worthless.<br /><br />I'm also still not thrilled by the opening track, \\"Caravan.\\"  While it isn't the train wreck I thought it was with my initial listen, I still think it tries to do too much.  Too many tempo and key changes, too much \\"junk\\" thrown in that makes the song sound noisy and cluttered.  If the song was trimmed down a bit and cleaned up of some of the clutter, it would be pretty solid.<br /><br />Before this sounds all bad, let me say that track 9, \\"Headlong Flight,\\" in an incredible piece of music.  By far my favourite on the album, strong, heavy sound, catchy refrain, good lyrical content.  Other solid tracks are \\"The Garden,\\" a beautiful piece of music to end the album, and \\"The Anarchist.\\"  \\"The Garden\\" has lyrics that sound like guys nearing their 60s who have thought a lot about life and realize that time is slipping away.  It is a haunting piece of music that leaves one with a sense of regret, yet hopeful.  Solid ending to the album.<br /><br />Back to track 2, \\"BU2B,\\" it starts with some strange-sounding eerie vocals, and only gets into the meat of the song at nearly a minute into it.  I think it should have just started right in there.  Had it, this track would be fairly solid.<br /><br />As for the title track, \\"Clockwork Angels,\\" again with the eerie sounding vocals to begin the song!  At seven and a half minutes long, this track is too long and too weak, and does the same thing Rush does too much on this album, meandering around in a song instead of making it tighter and more to-the-point.  The length of the song isn't the problem, since I love \\"Headlong Flight\\" and it is only about 10 seconds shorter.  But with \\"Clockwork Angels,\\" there is not enough to keep your attention for that long.<br /><br />Conversely, track 4, \\"The Anarchist,\\" is a solid track, even though it is nearly 7 minutes long.  The difference between this track and \\"Clockwork Angels\\" is it does a better job sticking to a consistent theme throughout.  It also begins with a solid instrumental section (nearly one and a half minutes) that is carried along throughout the song.<br /><br />The next four tracks are decent but not instant classics.  \\"Carnies\\" has a wonderfully heavy opening guitar, \\"Halo Effect\\" is a typical-length song (typical for most bands, not Rush!) just over three minutes with a mellow feel that doesn't make the mistake other tracks makewith going on and on.  It maintains a tight theme from start to finish.  \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\" sounds like old Rush, but it doesn't carry enough punch for six and half minutes.  \\"The Wreckers\\" has a lead guitar opening that sounds like something from the 60s, then has a very tragic feel to it from the middle to the end.  All four of these tracks are good but nothing jumps out as great.<br /><br />\\"Wish Them Well\\" is a decent song that is a bit lengthy.  Nothing jumps out as wonderful about it, but it is a bit catchy.  Then the album ends with \\"The Garden,\\" just a wonderful piece of music.<br /><br />Of interest, while `Snakes & Arrows' had three instrumental tracks, which I thought was a bit much, `Clockwork Angels' has none.  Rush is known for incredible instrumental pieces, so this surprises me.  But I suppose because they are doing a concept album and telling a story throughout, they couldn't get away with a purely instrumental track.<br /><br />Also, this album has four tracks that clock in at nearly 7 minutes or over.  At times I feel like Rush doesn't know how to end a song.  Still, with over an hour of music, these guys worked hard on this album.<br /><br />Perhaps my personal test for individual songs is if I were to make a \\"best of Rush\\" CD, would any of them make the cut?  No question \\"Headlong Flight\\" would make it.  And while I'm extremely fond of \\"The Garden,\\" it isn't typical Rush and wouldn't fit in with most of my favorites which would be heavier sounding.  Still, I'd put it at the end of the \\"best of\\" CD.  I wouldn't include any other tracks.  Thus, for `Clockwork Angels,' I have to go with 3 out of 5 stars.  If I could grade this out of 100, I'd go with a 76.  Not the best work from Rush, but then I've come to expect the moon from these guys every time.  And come next album, I'll buy it as soon as it is available, no questions asked.<br /><br />1-Caravan - 7/10<br />2-BU2B - 7/10<br />3-Clockwork Angels - 5/10<br />4-The Anarchist - 9/10<br />5-Carnies - 8/10<br />6-Halo Effect - 8/10<br />7-Seven Cities of Gold - 8/10<br />8-The Wreckers - 8/10<br />9-Headlong Flight - 10/10<br />10-BU2B2 - 1/10<br />11-Wish Them Well - 8/10<br />12-The Garden - 10/10
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I saw a video of these guys on YouTube and they were so much fun I immediately looked for their cd. Glad I did. With the exception of song 6, I have listened to this over and over again in the short time I've owned it. My favorite is still number 10.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Such a creative concept behind this movie. They do a great job of capturing the sort of surreal nature of a little girl's imagination.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|Look, what can you say about Lawrence of Arabia?  It is one of the greatest and most honored epic films of all time.  I remember my parents taking me to Manhattan one day when I was a kid.  There on Broadway was Lawrence at the Criterion theater, Brando in Mutiny on the Bounty, the next block over at the Loews State.  A few blocks over at the Demille was Zanuck's The Longest Day and across the street at the Warner-Cinerama was How the West Was Won, all playing on a reserved seat basis.  Boy, those where the days.<br />The fascinating thing about Lawrence (and those other films,) is when you see hundreds of Arabs on horseback and camels charging through the desert and quickly attack and conquer a Turkish city, you are really looking at hundreds on men on horseback.  It is all for real.  There is no CGI with someone sitting at a computer keyboard creating these epic scenes.  (Thats what I love about The Dark Knight Rises.  The scene of hundreds of Gotham City cops charging down Wall Street to confront hundreds of the villain, Bane's stooges is also done with real people: stuntmen and extras.  I find that scene breathtaking.)  And everything in Lawrence of Arabia is breathtaking as well.  I cannot imagine how difficult it must have been to make this film, the bulk of which takes place in the desert.  It was and still is a spectacular achievement.<br />If you have the money to spend, I really recommend this 50th. Anniversary Collector's Edition.  The picture quality of the blu-ray is gorgeous, the best I've seen.  There are three other discs, one of which is the beautiful soundtrack of this film.  The other discs include some new and old material.  There is a new interview with Peter O'Toole on the film and a Martin Scorcese discussion of the film as well.  There is an old \\"Making of\\" dcumentary, that runs over an hour.  There is a very nice short feature on the various advertising campaigns for the film.  And numerous other special features.<br />Finally, there is a new, beautiful hard-covered book on the making of this film, sort of like the type they used to sell in movie theaters for films like this years ago.  This book is new, not a duplication of the one sold in theaters way back in 1962-'63.  Finally, there is a frame of film from the picture, nicely packaged and included as well.<br />If you are thinking of buying Lawrence of Arabia on blu-ray, this is the way to go.  Highly recommended.

My daughter loves it and I have to say, I didn't listen THAT close, but some of the songs did sound pretty decent.

0374214913|2.0|I looked forward to reading this book while relaxing over the holidays. It started out well enough in engaging my interest. But somewhere about page 40, I found no reason to continue.<br /><br />My interest probably started disintegrating about the time the narrator described his attractive, successful, and \\"together\\" female roommate as an \\"android.\\"  Which was fine with him, because he \\"welcomes our android overseers.\\"<br /><br />But I plowed on, waiting for the plot to thicken, the threads to solidify. Instead... well, I guess this book is just meant for a very different reader.
B0000026UV|5.0|I am a BIG fan of Chet Atkins and Mark Knophler.  I received this album as a present and was so very happy to have gotten it.
B008L1DNGI|3.0|It is not my kind pelf game. But if you like puzzles and that kind of stuff. Its pretty hard. I still pretty clueless about it after play the.tutorial twice. But its.ok. Not terible but not great. But its an option.
0545265355|5.0|The books are beautiful. they will stay in my library forever. Thank you for a perfect christmas. sincerely Margaret Slocum
B009CPEOC4|5.0|The documentary shows what a sweet and funny girl she truly is..bittersweet seeing how well she does with her tour and at the same time trying to work on her marriage that falls apart-I just wanted to hug her at the end of the movie and tell her everything's going to be alright.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book soaked me in at the first page. You can't explain how it makes you feel, happy and sad at the same time. I couldn't put it down!! 5 stars very well deserved.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|This is a great game. Alot of fun to play.entertaining.My daughter and I both enjoyed this game.a must get game.
B0098WWDY2|5.0|I just recently became acquainted with Lee Ritenour and wish I had come across him sooner. Maybe I'm getting old, but I'm leaning more towards his brand of jazz and less towards the blues I've been listening to for the past 45 years or so.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This movie is not for everyone,, rather raunchy,, but very funny,, rated R, did enjoy it the second time around.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|enjoyed playing...while waiting at the airport .good graphics .would recommend this game to others. l like most of the G5 games
B0071XO8RA|4.0|An interesting, solidly written young adult sci-finovel. Mostly action, with just enough conceptual work to keep it interesting. The pace isn't perfect and the characters, especially side characters are occasionally flat, but it is entirely worth a read, and you will want to loan it to your friends.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have a lot of fun playing this and it seems to be addicting. Play it and find out how fun it is.
B00632HWOG|5.0|It does what i expected  it  to do .The transformation from my computer to the Kindle was easy and without complications.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Has answers about everything!! It gives a good answer on touchy questions such as does God exist and the answers won't make anyone or a certain group mad.<br />I would change nothing about this app.<br />I recommend this app to anyone who wants to learn more than you ever will in any type of school.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've been reading SK novels since the mid 70's and like his style. Being a prolific writer like he is, there are bound to be a few duds here and there.<br /><br />Not this one!<br /><br />Well written with a good story line throughout. I enjoyed this book a lot and think you would too!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Very surprised! I had heard all the raving reviews about this book, but ever a skeptic, I \\"borrowed\\" this from Amazon prime and I am glad I did! In  the beginning there is some confusion in where and when this takes place that is never really clarified, but soon it does not matter and the author quickly has you wrapped into the characters and story. I read this from cover to cover in less than 24 hours, and I am looking forward to the second book!
B002SGYPS2|5.0|Love this movie.  I could watch it over and over...and I do :)  A good choice for my Kindle Fire.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This is a very interesting series we've just started watching with the family. Can't wait to catch up on the series!
B009NQKXYK|1.0|Movie was dumb and didn't really have anything to do with the trailer we saw before we rented the movie.  Don't waste your money on this one!
B005LAII0I|5.0|Took the family to see this at the movies and decided to get it once it was released.  Clean movie for family game / movie night.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Beautiful CD from him, he amazingly sounds just as fresh as he always has, musical arrangements are stellar. If you love Van, buy it!
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This movie is so funny ! We love watching it with the family on family game / movie night .
B008SVS3FC|5.0|The best from John Hiatt in a while IMHO, though I don't dislike any of his CD's, this one I find I can't eject it from the CD player! Have it in my car player STILL!
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|This is one of my husband's favorite shows!  Not too &#34;out there&#34; for sci fi - even I am a fan!
0316228532|2.0|I tried to like this book, but it just didn't happen. I could barely get through it. And I am not comparing it to H. Potter. This book was awful. It was boring and sometimes confusing. I understand, not every book can be a mega-seller but this book should have been sent back to the writer before going to print. Save yourself some time and pass this one by. There are lots of great books out there.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Pros of watching this movie:<br /><br />decent action<br />brief glimpse of a nice Ferrari<br />tons of zombies and zombie killing<br /><br />Cons:<br />Bad directing<br />poorly written script and bad one-liners<br />cheap CG stunts<br />unrealistic explosions from cars and motorcycles<br />inconsistent bullet physics<br />main character reloaded a pistol once in the entire movie, picked up a new set of guns, never reloaded again<br />inconsistent blood spatter with certain gunshot wounds<br />recycled the same ideas and some of the lines from the first movie<br /><br />Overall:<br />1 out of 5, i demand a refund of $3.99 from Writer and Director, Paul W. S. Anderson as well as a formal public apology to all loyal Resident Evil fans from Mr. Anderson and Sony Pictures for taking the creativity and great storytelling and action from the games and turning it into this poorly made movie.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|Excellent read of classic literature. Irish authors rock. Get your 18 hundreds on and read away. Wonderful supernatural classic literary adventure.
B000OVLINI|5.0|I enjoyed reading this mystery/suspense love story novel. It was well written and easy to follow. I liked the intertwined parrell lives of the characters. I was intrigued by the twists and turns in the story. Daniel was an interesting character and as the story evolved it kept your riveted with the mystery behind the writer Julian Carax. Fermin was an interesting character that proved his loyalty to his benefactors. I got to dislike the villian Inspector Fumero in his role. The love story of Julian and Penelope and Daniel and Beatriz were similiar separated by years. The novel had humor, murder/mystery/suspense and love. I would recommend this novel to my friends.
B007RTAR64|5.0|My daughter loves her Katniss Everndeen Barbie. The details are incredible, and it is a nice change for her to own a brunette &#34;bada$$&#34; Barbie doll.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this app only wish you would earn coins quicker. Its a fun game that reminds me of Dave &amp; Busters coin machines!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I thought  the book was hilarious because this is one out of 7 of a awesome series I enjoy. Thanks.
B00008ENTJ|2.0|The music on the album is great.There's no question about it.However,the album presents two problems:The jacket was tore apart in one side and the other one was the vinyl itself. The vinyl was very dirty with some stains on it. A bad pressing I think.I had to reattach the jacket with some glue and clean up the record.Despite doing all of this.The vinyl had  many pops and clicks.I had to sell the album and buy another one in a local store.This one was much better.I don´t know what´s happening with the US pressings.The same happened  with the Beatles Vinyl box set 2012(this item wasn't bought on Amazon),but It's somethig it's happening.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|Works very well. Ii is good to know that I am protected. I don't have to worry about spam or viruses.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This one kept me turning the pages and picking up the story constantly even through a hectic holiday. It's a fun read, but also a bit unbelievable as it comes together so smoothly for the main character. Still, it's great fun to see the almighty legal system get played---legally. I've stayed away from Grisham books of late as they seemed to slide into formula and have a message to sell of late. This bookis just good old Grisham fun.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I don't like the way it makes moves automatically and I don't like that you always win.  It is boring to play.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I found this book dis-jointed in its telling and after reading it, I found myself asking where some of the story lines (side-lines???) finally got resolved. The characters and back stories will not be well understood by anyone not familiar with Cornwell's previous novels. And though I've read all her books, I found myself searching memory for some of the references. I did not find the serial killer well developed or realistic which is a shame because that is usually part of Cornwell's gift of story- tellling. However, this book did go back to her old ways of bringing the autopsy room and results to the forefront.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These three books were very fast reads.  I enjoyed the characters and how they developed. I must admit that after the first book I did start to &#34;fast forward&#34; through a lot of the sexual encounters...it got a little tedious.  But I would still give it a 5 star!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Almost everyone needs a dictionary.  This one is easy to use.  In many cases you need to type only the first few letters of the word you are looking for and your word is in the list.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|These are pretty airy headphones ... bough a few pairs for my studio needs and was quite happy with the build quality.  Not sure they are hugely accurate but quite comfortable and surprisingly lightweight for the size
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The blu-ray quality was outstanding. This is definitely a movie that should be seen in blu-ray. I enjoyed it significantly more than I did in theaters.<br /><br />While not as good as The Dark Knight (near impossible task), Rises is still pretty decent. It does have its plot holes and a long runtime although for most it won't feel like it. Bane is a decent villain. There are some fantastic scenes and a ton of twists and turns that makes this a 5 star movie. People are going to complain regardless of the ending. Too long, too short, too happy, too sad, etc. I think it does a pretty fine job of meeting it all in the middle.
B003W5C0VM|3.0|Surprisingly medium quality.  Almost like a documentary style video but obviously shot on film.  Mick Taylor was great .  For what I paid as a used one this is very decent but I would not buy it new.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is really fun and addicting but if your not willing to pay for anything  it takes a while to get very far in the game. Also I can't help but feel their ripping off gun bros.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|OK  won't watch this three times a year but it is still very good .... entertaining and should be relatively cheap these days.
B009KHCRVO|1.0|Not only was this movie terrible at so many levels, I ended up paying twice, due to problems with the portal.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Not sure I buy Ann Hathaway as the tough chick but whatever. I bought mine used so a bit cheaper ... doubt I would pay full price as this does not have all the impact of some of the other high tech movies which I prefer
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Boo!  This is just chase scenes. No content at all.  Very disappointing.  Not a good move for the Bourne Franchise.
B003Y5H542|5.0|I am sure there are people who might not like this movie but I have watched this ALOT..  really a treat and kinda like watching a Don Knots picture.  I will keep this one forever.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The case is just as described. The Kindle is easy to put into the case and it seems durable. This case offers back protection without adding much thickness.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|Typically violent and sex laden HBO stuff but this is like watching 10 motion pictures in a row.  Sadly season 2 and 3 are not out yet or else I would snap them up in a heartbeat.
B00A8V3VVG|2.0|i was wait for this soundtrack more as a year . But all of this is stolen and a bad compilation of old italien spaghetti westerns . Ennio Morricone is a genious but his new song is not the old good style and without power . I hope the movie is better
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Worth the money although I think I bought this used or a demo.  These things drop so much in price you gotta be carfeul.
B00314VYNE|5.0|I gave this to my niece for christmas, it looked like it just came from the store; would buy from again
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Great book, good movie. My daughter has already watched it 4 times and we've only had it for 3 days!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|You must read this book. Once finished, it is only then that you will truly understand what a hero is.
B008602KQI|4.0|Of course the book is always better. This was a good movie though. My daughter and I have read the book and both agree it is better. My son did not read the book and we feel we were explaining a few things to him.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|right on my Kindle startup screen.  Makes it easy to learn new tech while familiar look and feel.  thanks for offering it!
B004AKCME8|5.0|My 10 year old son really liked this movie. He had read the book and really enjoyed it. The graphics are beautiful!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app is cool. I use it all the time and on my phone too. and it lives me notifications of all the peeps sweating my pics and status.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|What can you say about Despicable me? It's just funny! I could watch it over and over. Can't wait for the 2nd movie!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This works perfect with my kindle fire HD. I also have this app on my love to. lol it comes with me every where lol
B007L6VR12|2.0|We had read great reviews when this was in the movie theater. It was ok, quite slow. It reminded me of the slow pace of Fargo, but less entertaining.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I love this game!  Had it on my pc and was glad to find it available for my Kindle!!  Easy to play and I enjoy setting up my fish tanks!
B0026SCMNM|3.0|what i disliked was that amazon could not move it to my kindle...i kept getting the review only after purchasing the book.  the book review looked interesting but i never got the book.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I can see why this game is rated so high. Fluid gameplay, great graphics, and plenty of charm on the side. Yes the game has in-app purchasing, and personally I'm tired of hearing people whine about it our giving a game a bad rating b.c. of it! If you don't want to use it, then don't. Our better yet turn it off via your phone's settings. Did I mention this is a great game?
B004K4IZ3G|4.0|It is a great movie for science fiction. It is a very interesting movie for the people I bought for a Christmas gift.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is such a fun game.  I have it on my phone and Kindle Fire.  It is completely addictive.  I am always trying to beat my top score.  I like that there are multiple game options.
B009HELT3C|5.0|Tommy Lee Jones & Will Smith are at it again....or is it for their first time?  There is TIME TRAVEL in the latest MIB movie and we get the answer to why Agent K is so....Agent K.  A good, fun movie the whole family will enjoy!
0375869026|5.0|I am a school librarian.  Read about this and convinced my book club to read it.  It was loved by everyone!  We are now donating our copies to the school libraries.  Great story for all ages!
B009369Z8A|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  Tom Hardy and Jessica Chastain were fabulous together.  Tom should get an Oscar for his performance. Only wish some of the scenes were lit better.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Another great season of nerdy laughs. This season builds on the first four and continues the to provide new ways to make you laugh.
B00190OHD6|5.0|WAS GIVEN AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT.  RECIPIENT LOVES ROMANTIC MOVIES AND THIS ONE IS VERY GOOD AND TO THE MARK.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|This show is so good it is scary. This is the fifth season and has lost nothing. It continues to provide excellent drama.
B009LRE040|5.0|COLLECT ALL THE BATMAN MOVIES FROM THE BEGINING.  LIKE CERTAIN PORTRALS OF BATMAN OVER OTHERS.  THINK THAT CHRISTIAN BALE IS THE BEST.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|This is a fantastic app. I have it on both my Samsung Galaxy S3 and my iPhone and it works great on both. Love the ability to play local stations as well as stations from around the world.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|This is one of my favorite Christmas movies so when I found it on bluray I was on it.  It arrived in perfect condition and the price was incredible.  Very pleased with my purchase.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Sparks never disappoints!  Enjoyed this book very much even though it was very emotional to read! Would recommend to anyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addictive and so much fun 2 play. Very easy to learn. I would definitely recommend to anyone.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I did not enjoy this film but rented it for guests. Too violent and too dark in my opinion. Despite all the action I feel asleep while watching this.
B005HSL626|5.0|II love this game. I sit and play it for hours. Definitely one of my favorites. I highly recommend to all looking for something fun and easy
B001CTDH76|5.0|Bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He wanted to watch the show from the beginning.  And you can't beat the price for a complete season of a show.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband who was returning from a deployment, it was the one thing he really wanted and everything was perfect the movie was amazing, would watch over and over again.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This game is so in the seasons spirit ok love it!!!! I really want to be in the game I want to fly!!! And yes I can dream!! Is that ok!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie is highly entertaining and hilarious! Essentially this is the show Glee meets Dodgeball (the movie). A classic for your movie collection. Enough said.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Let me get this out of the way: I am a HUGE Colleen Hoover fan.  Does this mean I won't give a honest review?  No.  I love books and thrive off of honest reviews.  However, this book is a prime example of why I will always be a CH fan. (yes, I just initialed her name...she's amazing)<br /><br />Now for the review:<br /><br />Sky is a girl who is very unattached to those around her.  She is a pro at faking emotions and just going through the motions of what is expected of her from her friends and boys.<br />Holder sees her and immediately a spark is ignited.  Holder is misunderstood and lives a life of regret.  When these 2 get together, there is chemistry beyond horomones.<br />This book had an amazing story line, even if you figured it out early. The point for me wasn't to figure anything out, but to live the story of Sky and Holder while processing all of the emotions previously mentioned.  Along with a very heavy storyline, Hopeless delivered a sweet, determined and intense love story.<br /><br />Hopeless was a book that I tried to put down for breaks because I was reading it way too fast and I didn't want the book to end.  At one point, I looked at my husband and said, \\"I need to slow down or the first reading will be over too soon!\\" (yes, I will read it again)<br /><br />This story has regret, confusion, battles of how you are 'supposed' to feel, and how one is to cope with horrible circumstances that are very real in too many young adults lives.<br /><br />Read it. Process it. Love it.
098555780X|5.0|My daughter gave her brother this book for Christmas.  He LOVED it and has been trying all of the knots.  He's a 10 year old Cub Scout that is trying to learn every knot he can.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This is an insight to war that you will not soon forget. You will feel the mud and blood of this soldiers time in the Pacfic.
B0060D196K|5.0|This is a wonderful version of A Christmas Carol.  Jim Carey at his best (even as a cartoon character). A must see.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great game; I enjoyed the sytory -! It was entertaining and the graphics were great. Most importantly, it functioned perfectly and never crashed, like some of them do. Worth the price.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I read this shortly after I read Gone Girl, and both books demonstrate Gillian Flynn's remarkable gift for crafting a story with jarring, shocking plot twists and turns.  Camille's character is scarily close to the edge during the whole book, tiptoeing closer and closer as the book progresses.  I found myself silently willing Camille not to drink and not to stay in her mother's house (among other things) during several parts of this story.  Unlike other thrillers, the protagonist has no holier-than-thou moments; almost every decision Camille makes is the wrong one, and in several spots those decisions left me feeling almost uncomfortable.  Flynn makes you feel (and fear) the impending train wreck.  This is her gift, and it's why her books suck you in.
B004GYY714|5.0|Using tune in radio I can listen to the programs I love wherever I am.  And when I want to pick up a station out of my area to hear the latest news or the traffic situation in that area it's easy to tune in.
1400064287|5.0|As I read this book  ways to improve my  services began to pop-up in my mind.  Simple yet profound concepts  are included that can help you  improve your business, presentation or a simple conversation.<br /><br />I created my first mobile app as I read.<br /><br />Thanks,
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I picked this color for my Wifes Fire so we could tell them apart. You cant go wrong with this kind of &#34;FIRE PROTECTION !!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I had not read any of the Reacher books. This was the first of the series. I was very easy to read and kept my interest. Lots of action  . I am now reading the second one in the series and it is just as good. Very good mystery stories.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This movie is a great take on the horror movie parodies that have been coming out for the last decade or so.  Where the Scary Movie series are ridiculous and skip around from  one pop culture reference to another, this movie is a lot more like Sean of the Dead.  I thought it plateaued a bit early and lost some of its humor towards the end, but I still really enjoy watching it.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|This Game was purchased for my Kindle Fire for my Grand Kids to play and they have not tried it yet.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great Book! I read the 3 books in 2 weeks. They are amazing. I couldnt stop reading them. I hope the movie comes out really soon.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I purchased this for my Grand Kids and as of now they have not been able to play this game.
1423140605|5.0|I bought this for my 13 year old grandson, Gabe.  He read it in one day, and the next day he was reading it again, &#34;Just going over the great parts Grandpa&#34;
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I purchased this game for all the Grand Kids and they have not played it on the Kindle Fire yet.
8876250441|5.0|We are big Twilight series fans here, and couldn't do without the last book in the collection.  Great price as compared to the paperbacks now available - and a lot more fun to have a hardback book to hold.  Wonderful story!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Purchased this for my Grand Kids and this game is really loved by them they beat me at every game.
B002KCNVMA|5.0|A great Lego piece, but does take some time to put together.  My son did a lot of it (he's 8), but he needed help in certain areas.  Once it's done, though, it's a great set to play with.  It's already a favorite here!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I purchased this for my Grand Kids but none of them have attempted to use it on the Kindle Fire yet.
B0054R6BFM|3.0|I should have read the synopsis of this book more closely.I didn't realize it was written for teenagers. I think a high school girl would enjoy it.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|This game was purchased for my Grand Kids Kindle Fire and they have not tried to play the game yet.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Great for when you have morning sickness! Or when you're visiting the in-laws too! No really, great book- Tina is my new hero (sorry Oprah).
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I Purchased this game for myself and my Grandkids and we love love love it, I wish there was a longer playing time and more coins but its fun.
B009X01FJS|4.0|Unlike a few of the previous reviewers, I did not have any trouble (even with my arthritic fingers)  easily fitting my Kindle Fire HD into the case.  And though I initially detected a slight odor as some others have reported, it quickly dissipated after being left open in the air for a short while.  I also love the fact that the case allows you to stand your kindle either vertically or horizontally.<br /><br />My only complaint has to do with the on/off feature that is suppose to be activated when closing and opening the cover of the case.  I have noticed that the kiindle does not always &#34;wake up&#34; after I've opened the cover of the case and I've had to close and open it a couple of times to get it to start or, on occasion, use the on/off button on the kindle to start it.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game was purchased for my Grand Kids to play on the Kindle and they really Love it and beat me every time.
B009E3EY38|4.0|This is a beautifully put together set, the album sounds great the set list is one that any Zepp fan can enjoy. That being said as stated in some of the other reviews some of the editing on the live footage isn't the greatest but it is still a wonderful set and worth every penny. The blu ray quality is top notch and the extra footage on the bonus disc is really fun to watch. Nothing can be perfect and this comes very close. If you are a fan and don't own this yet buy it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I purchased this game for the Grand Kids and they have not been able to try it as of yet.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|GREAT series, you will be blown away. Love watching this when i'm chilling. Its extremely interesting and will leave you in awe of the planet we call Earth.<br /><br />Picked it up on a special .
B0063IH60K|5.0|I purchased this for myself and the Grand Kids and it is a great game to play to keep ones mind occupied.
B002M9WW30|5.0|One of the best classics. Except for 4 .<br /><br />This is an iconic movie , I bought the set just to have in my collection. Its still wrapped. Hopefully when I can get my girl to sit down for a couple of hours I'm guna have her watch it.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I purchased this game for the Grand Kids and they really love it so far have beat me every time.
B000A6CLL0|5.0|Love this series, wish it would have gone longer. Enjoying watching the series over again though. Love the whole cast.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Although Nicholas Sparks books tend to be repetitive, I enjoyed this book better than a lot of his others. I couldn't put it down and finished it in two days!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|not yet started using it.. but got it for free.. so no complaints..<br />not yet started using it.. but got it for free.. so no complaints
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Not what I expected. I was looking for something more like the original Oregon Trail. This game is probably fine for someone who isn't expecting that.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun & entertaining!!! Totally addictive...love that it is free also!!! Angry birds, my Kindle & me......good times!!!! Wow, who knew!!!
B0074YVW1G|5.0|There was sufficient research to make it a good science-based text but would into a good story. It helped explain many of my own traits as merely introversion and not a personality flaw. I see now that it is OK to want to stay home on Friday night rather than party al night long.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|Great historical fiction as usual. Always an interesting read. I have loved Cornwell ever since Sharpe's Rifles even like his non-historical work.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Oh Colleen, how I love you.  I squealed and called my husband in to tell him \\"I Don't know HOW SHE DOES IT!\\"<br /><br />Sky and Six are adorable best friends. I love that they aren't all mushy and fake.. they tell it like it is with each other.  And Holder, he is like walking sex with his \\"lickable dimples\\" he is super easy to fall in love with! I knew that Holder knew Sky from somewhere.. but I had no idea how intricately their stories are intertwined.  I always think I can figure out the big twist or the big secret.. but I didn't see all the twists coming in this story. It is amazing.<br /><br />I see a few people saying that they didn't want to continue this book or didn't enjoy this book because of the \\"graphic content\\" relating to the stories of sexual abuse. I know it's hard to read but it's real. Things like that really happen to people.  I think that's why I enjoy Colleen's books so much.. they contain events that occur everyday... not vampires and werewolves and pixies. You don't see anyone getting upset because of the pixie content.  I respect authors like Colleen Hoover, Tammara Webber, and Rebecca Donovan that can really put it out there. They give you the raw emotion that exists everyday.. life is not supposed to be pretty!<br /><br />TLDR: Buy it, read it, love it.<br /><br />Another great book Colleen - so proud of you!

B0091REZMW|4.0|I just started playing. It seems fun so far. didn't download all graphics yet. we'll see how that affects playability.
1416909532|5.0|Although the book is a really simple read and is pretty much common sense its a nice refresher course to common sense in relationships or lack there of.  If you think to yourself &#34;what am I doing wrong in relationships?&#34; or know you're in a bad one or feel like you've been single way too long... whatever it is, this book probably has an answer. and as simple as it may be, it bares repeating to every female.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I love the show and the music is the best part, the sound track doesn't disappoint, would recommend the sound tract for sure.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|We love this movie. It has a great message and is appropriate for all ages. It is a nice spin the the original Dr Suess book.

B008WCP2PG|5.0|I love the movie it would buy again to give as a gift for my friends and will watch many times
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|I watched this movie with my dad and we were both gut hurting by the end.  We literally had to take a break because we were laughing so hard.  This movie is wrong on so many levels it is abnormal.  Definitely not for anyone under 17. If you have a weak bladder you should either skip this one or wear a depends because it will make you laugh so hard you will pee.
B00866JL96|5.0|I love the movie it would buy again to give as a gift for my friends and will watch many times
B00A7CF1QY|5.0|I think this one holds its own with the Matt Damon trilogy.  I would have liked to see a cameo appearance but it still was a great flick. Very suspenseful and lots of good actions sequences.  I initially felt let down because I wanted more. However, I got over it and I still think it was a great movie. I own all the Bourne movies now.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I love the movie it would buy again to give as a gift for my grandchildren and will watch many times

B007V65R54|5.0|This is an excellent book for someone who enjoys good, solid, interesting information. It can be dry. I had to put it down and pick it back up again quite a few times.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|What can I say, but that I am hooked on the EDGE!!!  I got to level ten and had to stop to make this review, needed a few minutes to take a breath.  I'm only getting C's and D's so far, but who cares, I'm having FUN!!!  Enjoy!!!
B008LV8TSU|5.0|This has been on of my favorite books for a few years. I was excited to read it with my children.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|The only issue I have with this app is the fact that it's not tailored for my &quot;Kindle Fire&quot;. Besides that it works pretty fine.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|My kids and my husband both love the game, it keeps them out of my hair for hours... I can't decide if that is good or bad since I have a 2 year old who still needs a lot of attention and a 4 month old.  I thinks it a great little game!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I have read all 3 books and this really followed the story in the book.  I can't wait for the next movie to come outl.
0374533571|4.0|I saw the preview for the movie of this book and thought it looked like a great movie.  I then found out it was a book and checked it out.  I really don't like to have an idea of the characters and story before reading a book because I feel that it can dictate your impressions of the book but I have only seen the preview for the movie so I figured I was good.<br /><br />This book was fairly quick moving and is seen through the eyes of Pat, the main characters.  Pat is just getting out of a mental health institution and to say the least has a number of different issues going on in his life.  He is hell bent on reuniting with his ex-wife and has committed himself to improving as many aspects of his life in order to do so.<br /><br />The book does a good job at showing you the world through Pat's eyes.  The book does have a lot of inspirational notes within it but also shows a lot of the struggle that happens in life.  All in all this was a really good books that does a great job at showing you the world through someone else's eyes.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless was amazing!!! Colleen Hoover has truly give a great meaing to the title \\"Hopeless\\". This is a story I can read over and over. \\"Hopeless\\" is one of a few books that I have read and made my eyes water. I was completley blow away by the story and characters, and I sure you will be too. The story grabs you from the beginning and will definately hold you to the end. \\"Hopeless\\" is one book you will not put down. The story takes you through so many emotions and you feel all of the emotions that the characters in the book feel. \\"Hopeless\\" truly touches the heart, and if it doesn't touch yours maybe you don't have one. The story itself is such an inspiration and I think it has some of the most heartwarming conversations you will ever read in a book. I reccomend this book to any and everyone; you will not regret it.
1451696191|5.0|I recently took a trip to visit a fiend in Brazil and had about 12 hours of flying each way, so what better to do on an endless flight but read.  I downloaded the book The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephan Chbosky  I really didn't have a good idea of what the book was about but I saw the preview for the movie and it looked really good so I figured I'd read the book first.<br /><br />The book is written from the perspective of Charlie an outcast teenager that is writing letters to an anonymous friend, where he confides and describes that events that are taking place in his life as he starts high school.  I thought that Chbosky did a great job at recreating the emotional roller coast that is high school in America.  Charlie definitely has a unique perspective but the situations and issues that he runs into can be related to by anyone who has lived to tell about their high school experience.<br /><br />I won't ruin any ending for those of you who haven't read it but I will say that there is one point in the book that Charlie describes when he is riding with his two closest friends after a great night and one of their favorite songs comes on the radio and he describes the moment as feeling \\"infinite,\\" sort of a feeling of invincibility and happiness with the world.  Hopefully most of us got to experience that feeling at least at some point in high school.  I know that as an ultra runner that sort of feeling is what we strive for and spend hours or time and effort on to try and recapture a little bit of that feeling of being infinite.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book and I can't wait to see the movie.<br /><br />Full Review: [...]
B001IF252M|5.0|I use this cale everyday to have a second monitor attached to my MacBook Pro (mid-10). Have not had any problems with it.
0525478817|5.0|This was a great book.  I really can't comment a whole lot on the technical portions of how it was written but it is just one of those books that you get extremely entangled with the characters and their lives.  You don't really want the book to end because you feel like you've become attached to the lives of the characters and  you just don't want that relationship to end.<br /><br />This book gives you a view into a side of cancer and illness that I have personally really never thought of.  I thought that Green does a great job at sharing a new perspective even if it is one that many of us don't really want to see.<br /><br />Full Review: [...]
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|This product works extremely well.  One of my best buys that I have made. It is so nice being able to use a tv and an attached sound system to watch movies and work on projects.

B0096HID5M|5.0|Awesome music blended with a really fun story.  I love this movie.  Tom Cruise proves that he really can do it all
1476715904|5.0|I really enjoyed the characters in this book.  I laughed and cried.  I had to purchase book #2 to find out the rest of the story.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The Night Circus is original, moving, and thoroughly excellent. The richness of detail and the flowing story weave together to create a masterpiece.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|This is a book that gets into the heart of the people. The people eating, killing, cleaning, preparing, raising your food. The author really doesn't preach, he respects so many of the people in the book and agonizes over slighting them.<br /><br />I was raised vegan, ate meat for a year, then found myself on the edge of being vegetarian..this book made me realize I didn't -want- to eat meat, but I would never again turn food away and waste it..and thus the life with it.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Great price. Go price this any where else and you will pay triple for the same thing. I use this during interviews on both my Sony VX 2100 and my cannon 7D. I also plan to use it with my Zoom H1. Products great audio.

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I was just learning how to play from my Grandkids. Now they are enjoying seeing me play, too. Can get addicting!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a fun game to play with when you're doing nothing but very indicting to play that's why I gave this game four stars
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|I didn't care too much for the other films in the series. The first movie was okay but others just seemed like action with no story and didn't stick much to the plot of the game. This should be called Resident Evil Redemption because this movie redeemed the entire series. The characters in the movie actually act like they do in the game. At first it seems like Jill's character is over the top and cheesy but then you start to realize that her character in the games is over the top and cheesy so she actually came out just right. The action in this movie was much better than the previous one where there was action that was closer to the video game and of course plenty of zombies. It does leave you wanting to see more especially with the ending.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I finally received it after Christmas and I must say that I loved this trilogy directed by Nolan. I bought the DVD version of this trilogy and they all work and play smoothly. However, the quality is a bit grainy when I played it on my PS3. I used to play Blu ray movies but since I'm an avid gamer I usually just buy DVD version to watch on my desktop.<br /><br />It pretty much comes with the three films (DVD version):<br /><br />Batman Begins feature film<br />The Dark Knight feature film<br />The Dark Knight Rises feature film<br /><br />and the 64 page art book of the Dark Knight Trilogy<br /><br />There was another offer about the Ultimate Edition coming in the new year but I just overlooked it since I only wanted the three films just to watch. Good thing I bought this when it was on a sale for three great films!<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Nice cover design and casing of the DVD version<br />- Art book of the TDK Trilogy<br />- All three films of courses<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Sound is alright but it can be worked around by using your own surround system<br />- Quality is a bit grainy but I guess that's what you get for a DVD
B00A31UXLW|5.0|The  Black Box was everything you would expect from a Michael Connelly/Harry book.  Only problem was that I read it in a day so it proved to be very expensive
B004WGIXX4|5.0|Not my typical movie, but I actually enjoyed it. If you're looking for something serious or mind blowing, look elsewhere, but this movie, at least to me, has a lot of funny moments, a few time when you tear up, a few awkward times, and a proper ending. Formula? Yeah, like the good old movies.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|When I started this book I wasn't expecting anything but the way that the main character is honest and truth is so visible to him is relatable. through his letters and experiences you are pulled in and caught feeling amazing compassion and frustrating opinions. I think the experiences he goes through are also easy to relate to for anyone in or past high school. One of the most inspiring and amazing books I've read in a long time.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|You can change the beard color and hair color. cut and regrow it too!! Washing and blow drying is fun.  Taking pictures is fun to do after you are done with their hair using as many accessories as you want. They make funny faces!  lol
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is amazing. The game play is easy for even people that do not play many kindle games. I'm a mother of and think this is a great quick stress reliever.
B009RH973I|3.0|I bought this nice looking cover for my wife's Kindle. It protects it very well. The only thing it causes our Kindle to over heat and shut down. Without being in the cover it runs all day no problems. With the cover on it will shut down in 5 minutes!
B007N8RULO|1.0|I just helped my mother set up her new kindle fire and the Spider game. When we started the game all we could see were many pages of advertising with no obvious way to get to the actual game. Eventually we found some very tiny, low contrast links to close the ad pages but without those there was no way to reach the end of the ads. The real problem is that every page had a different navigation method and no repeatable method to leave. When you are showing someone who is new to a tablet this creates a real usability problem. After all the Kindle is bad enough when it comes to inconcistent navigation.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I thought this book was great. I couldn't put my kindle down!!! 5 stars. I was rooting for him to finally figure out it was love from the beginning
B004LWZWGK|4.0|The Dark Knight Rises is a great movie, and I don't want to pull down its star rating, so I'm giving it four stars. This review, though, isn't about the movie.<br /><br />I got this movie for Christmas, and specifically asked my wife for the combo pack, not because I wanted the DVD, but because I wanted the digital copy. The digital copy included with The Dark Knight was an iTunes redemption code. Unfortunately, with The Dark Knight Rises, the digital copy is the new industry standard, UltraViolet. And I'm here to tell you that Ultraviolet is just awful.<br /><br />It took three days just to redeem the code (servers were probably overwhelmed by the Christmas rush). They I had to sign in to two different services to access the digital copy. I downloaded the movie, hoping that would allow me to transfer it to iTunes so I could manage it with the rest of my movies, but no. I had to download the Flixter app, and would have to download the app for my iPhone as well to play it on there.<br /><br />I was feeling pretty disgruntled after all that, but then I tried to play it using the Flixter app. And, even though the movie has been downloaded, the app just sat there and said \\"Loading\\" for five minutes until I finally gave up.<br /><br />I guess I'll just take the DVD, fire up my trusty copy of Cocktail and rip it.<br /><br />The movie industry had a solution that worked for its customers. They abandoned that in favor of a clunky mess that, from what I can see, doesn't even work. The Dark Knight Rises gets four stars. UltraViolet earns zero.<br /><br />No more digital copies for me until they go back to iTunes redemption codes.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Finished it in 3 days, hard to put down<br />Can not wait to watch the movie ! ! ! !
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I would give  it 5 stars if some  of the items weren't hidden under the toolbar.  I had to use a hint to find them and some of the ghosts.  I would tap where the ghost was shown only to get a time penalty.  It would take several taps to reveal it and sometimes other objects as well.  Still I like the game.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Loved this book! I love sci-fie and someone recommended this book to me, well worth the read. It was satisfying to read just by itself, but I will e looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|My family LOVES the movies.  I always prefer the books and no matter how well done (these are definitely some of the best done books to movies) the movies just can't give all the detail and &#34;feel&#34; of the books for me.

8866131105|4.0|After using Tiffany and then Coach planners for years, I switched to Moleskine for 2010. I've been very happy with them. While no planner is perfect, the Moleskine Daily has been the best for the way I keep track of things.<br /><br />The pocket (3.5\\" x 5.5\\") is big enough to write in yet still fits comfortably in most purses. The large (5\\" x 8.25\\") is well-suited for a food and/or exercise journal. Both are almost 1\\" thick, as is to be expected from a page-a-day planner.<br /><br />I tend to slip invitations, receipts and other ephemera into my planner, and the elastic band keeps everything in place. Miraculously, the elastic has never become too stretched out. [See photo of my 2012 version of the [[ASIN:8866131059 Moleskine 2013 12 Month Daily Planner Black Hard Cover Pocket (Moleskine Diaries)]].]<br /><br />It would be nice if the month-in-review pages came at the beginning of each month instead of all at the front of the book. It would also be nice if the hours/time on the days began before 8 AM and went past 8 PM. And if Sunday had hours/time. I wish the bottom corners of the pages were perforated a la Coach spiral dairy as I prefer that to the bookmark as a way to find \\"today\\" quickly.  However, these aren't deal-breakers for me.<br /><br />In at least one review of a Moleskine daily planner, the reviewer complained that on the month-in-review pages, the weeks begin with Monday. For me, that's an advantage. (After all, Saturday & Sunday are the weekEND.)  Personal preferences aside, Moleskines are from Europe where, as in most of Western world, the week begins on Monday. It was described as \\"frustrating\\" and \\"confusing\\" in one comment. I can't believe it's that big an issue, especially in a DAILY planner, but if it would be for you, you may want to find a US-style calendar.<br /><br />Bottom line: These are very good planners. The hard covers are sturdy and the elastic is stretchy and both hold up all year. The design makes them flexible as far as how you use them (appointments, journaling, food diary, etc). The price is reasonable, making them a great value.them (appointments, journaling, food diary, etc). The price is reasonable, making them a great value.

1451638450|5.0|I have to say that Lois McMaster Bujold is one of my absolute favorite authors.  I have read and reread many of her books and know that I will again.  This is definitely one that I will reread.<br /><br />Ivan has always been in the background, but he started making his way to the foreground in A Civil Campaign (probably my VERY favorite Miles story).  In this one, he has come into his own, along with Byerly Vorrutyer.  The story starts out moving right along and doesn't slow down until you hit the end (which had me giggling quite a bit).  I won't tell you any more, as I hate when reviews tell you the whole story line.<br /><br />Bujold makes you laugh and think, which I think are two of her greatest strengths as an author.  If you like your sci fi mixed with some humor and lots of adventure/misadventure, then this is the story for you.  If you don't know the Miles books, read this one.  At the back is a chronology so that you can read them all in order.  If you do know the Miles books, I think you will love this, even though Miles is only a peripheral character.<br /><br />Thank you, Lois McMaster Bujold for a super read, and thank you Mom and Andrea for getting me all the books that I wanted this Christmas!
B004R13U6Y|5.0|Love being able to read, turn pages, resize, and markup. I only wish that, when the trial version expires, there would be a PROMPT provided to facilitate upgrading, which I definitely wanted to do. Had to figure out what to do and where to go when the program demanded an access code for the first time. Make it easier for customers to upgrade to the Pro version and the app would be practically perfect in every way.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. Great adventure the author takes you on. If you saw the movie and are hesitant to read the book or on the fence for any reason, don't be, this book doesn't disappoint.

0316232955|3.0|What is it about books classified as \\"Young Adult\\" that *must* include all that swearing and foul language? Not everyone talks like that, and all the time. That said, I appreciated Chris Colfer's honesty upfront: the language started from Page 1 and continued through the book, unlike so many other YA books where the author hides the first f-bomb in the middle of the story (Maggie Stiefvater's \\"The Raven Boys\\", for example. SO distracting. MOST disappointing.) I also forgive the liberal use of the bad language - while they may be gone like a storm in real or film speech, bad words in print, like porn, tend to stay in the mind - BECAUSE \\"Struck By Lightning\\" is supposed to be Carson Phillips' *journal.*<br /><br />Other than the limited vocabulary used by this aspiring journalist/editor (Carson Phillips, not Chris Colfer) even in his journal, where, surely he must be brave enough to try *some* new and unusual words, I didn't enjoy the book as much as I hoped I would because I didn't think Carson P. was that pleasant a character. Yes, there are many funny sit-com bits in this volume; no, they do not make you sympathise with poor, poor Carson. For the most part, this book reads exactly as it's supposed to read, I suppose, like it was written by someone who hates his life and makes bitter jokes all the time because something better is constantly out there. I've met people like that. They are not positive in any way or to anyone (except, apparently, to their mothers) and. as such, this book may be valuable - it may make some people realise why certain folks get ostracised in life.<br /><br />I would have given this book two-and-a-half stars, except that I do think Chris Colfer is still trying to find his voice in writing and I see where he has potential, but the ending for \\"Struck By Lightning\\" was truly problematic for me as well: it was \\"ironic\\" in the sense of the song by Alanis Morrisette, not in classical school-taught literature. As a conservative parent who still makes unapologetically valiant attempts to screen everything her 13-going-on-30 daughter reads, I'd been feeling pretty let-down by Justine Magazine already over subscriber customer service(see previous review) - now I'm feeling cautious about going with their book recommendations at all, since both \\"The Raven Boys\\" and \\"Struck By Lightning\\" made their list. Will my daughter read this book? Not with my approval - but if she does, I'll certainly be happy that I will be able to discuss it with her. Will this book make it to our personal home library, electronically or otherwise? Not likely. It lacks the self-motivating depth of other self-discovery books. At this point in *her* life, I prefer books that inspire, rather than despair.
B0032FPVKE|5.0|I love this bag.  I thought it would be too small but it fits all I need and it is not too big to take on the go.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I think this book was awesome!!!but it wasn't as good as the others, but over all I think this book was amazingly written
B005HSL626|5.0|Great game. Difficulty makes u come back and conquer it. A must try game. Keeps it exciting as the games gets faster.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Is a good free game and enjoy playing.  I would download the game again and everyone can play without lessons on how to.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is everything I was expecting it to be when I ordered it.  It looks fantastic and the sheath keeps it safe.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|This is a good movie. I enjoyed the movie but the ending could have been a better. But over all it is a good movie. I think Liam Neeson was really good in the movie.
B007FJFDXS|1.0|It's too touchy for my kindle fire.  No matter how careful I am this game gets out of control on me.  Not much fun.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I absolutely adore this story! It's heartwarming and yet full of truths. You can learn a few important life lessons from reading this timeless tale and enjoy yourself doing it.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Finished book in two days! Could boot put it down.  I felt like I was listening to the thoughts and feelings of the characters . Would recommend to anyone who has ever struggled with time.
B006R6ZP6U|4.0|But I like that kind of thing. If you are looking for a serious movie look elsewhere. But if you want a laugh and giggle at a silly movie this is one.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Well, what else needs to be said?  It is Rod Stewart after all.  I have always been a great fan of his and I have enjoyed the CD.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I cannot understand where all of the praise and 5-star reviews is coming from. It takes half of the book to sink in who the main character is, the big reveal the reader doesn't even have to guess, because its obvious, and the end is one of the most anticlimactic I've ever read.<br /><br />That said, the environments and inner dialogues of characters are meticulously painted, at times, too well, and the mystery is revealed in a skillfully timely manner. Overall, 2/5. I'd love to not think that this was anything more than a setup for more books in a series, but perhaps packaging 1-5 was a poor choice. If I had bought them individually, I don't think I would have made it to 3.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Gotta love Dexter!<br />Too bad season 8 is his last season.<br />Michael C. Hall is the best.<br />A must purchase!
1449410243|5.0|She enjoyed the gift and the book. Clever book, fun for her.  Light hearted and friendly.recommend for all future catladies
B0079R8IYW|2.0|I took it off. It manages to be bulky and not very sturdy at the same time. It might get better with use
B009O2XY12|2.0|This game is suppose to be free, but it is impossible for me to go very far before I run out of bubbles and am asked to purchase more at 99 cents.  I don't like it.  It also is very hard to go back to the beginning levels so that my grandchildren can play.  If fact, I haven't figured it out and therefore the game has little value any longer.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I bought this for my son and on his request. He knew the product better than I did. He is very happy about it. It is well built, sturdy, compact. It includes necessary cables. It's an investment considering the price (even if we bought it for Black Friday with a discount) but it will serve its purpose very well. If you are a gamer and are traveling in between places, this is the right product for you. If you are tight on space and want to keep your place tidy (college students,....), it could also be the perfect item.<br />One small issue :  there is no room to store a headset.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|For the price you pay you can't beat it. i'd give it a 5 if it weren't for the ads, but again for the price.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Being a fan of the comic books series, I was not disappointed by this TV series. I am in fact very intrigued by the way they are making this TV series diverting from the original story.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|IT was Touching, funny,and Streep and Jones are the best. I beleive some people in real life can relate to this movie.
B0037RDPEG|2.0|This book was really slow in parts especially in the middle - and kind of boring. It was not what I expected. It did get better towards the end.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Not only did I love how real the plot was, the characters just took my breath away. Sky and Holder were so well thought out, it got to a point I knew how they were going to feel after a certain event. I want a boyfriend like Holder, no joke.<br />The story did was so creative and the twist really surprised me! You kind of have a little bit of mystery while you read because you want to know about their past. The foreshadowing is right on key and the whole plot has perfect timing. Could NOT put the book down.<br />Colleen has done it again!
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|Not a bad demo, but  you don't  have time to do much. You only get about 15 minutes of play.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Makes reading enjoyable again! I have this on my tablet and have done more reading than I have in years! Great application!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|It's rare that you come across an idea that is really unique in sci-fi lit, but High Howey has come up with an intriguing concept; one that promises more down the road.  The &#34;silo&#34; is a sealed environment ruled by an unseen hand, but whose?  Howey has the chutzpa to thrust a female hero, Juliette, into the midst of a battle between the doers and the thinkers, truth and lies, survival and oblivion.  She is both the hope and the curse to the inhabitants of the silo and, in a strange twist of fate, it is only by being sentenced to death by &#34;cleaning&#34; that her journey of salvation begins.
0062127241|5.0|Who couldn't like a book like this about one of the most talented musicians in the world. It's a book that should be read by anyone who has been a fan of The Who.
B0091VTNZC|5.0|This movie is probably my favorite movie to watch during the holidays.<br /><br />And don't forget &#34;Answer the Phone like Buddy the Elf Day&#34;!!!!!!!<br /><br />If you don't like this movie then you might not like the holidays!
1435114949|4.0|This book is huge and looks really nice! I bought it for my girlfriend's sister for christmas who happens to be a book worm, she instantly cracked it open and started reading it! she loves mystery so this book is great for her!
B0086700CM|5.0|My son put this on my phone and I could not put it down.  Loaded it on my Kindle, and can't put it down.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series keeps my husband and myself on the edge of our seats, and excited to watch the next episode!  We love this silly series.
1881273377|5.0|I would recommend this book/audio CD to anyone in any of type of relationship, especially to those in a marriage. It helps you understand how to love other people more effectively by meeting their love language. The shipping of the order was very fast as well.
B001V7UXG2|2.0|The show itself would get 5 stars but I have to give the DVD set only gets 2 stars.  They have no Closed Captioning nor subtitles and thus these DVD's are not watchable by any of my Deaf friends.  Very sad when a company completely ignores a minority because they are unwilling to pay the little extra to have captioning added to the DVD's.  Shame on you A&E.  I will have to re-think buying anything you produce.
0920668372|5.0|I used to read this to them when they were little.  Got these new ones to pass to them<br />in remembrance
B0086700CM|4.0|This is such a simple, but yet an addicting game to play. Always trying toto beat my high score. Great for all ages.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I agree this is not Grand Torino, but still excellent Clint Eastwood. The movie kept me engaged and besides the great acting, the director's balance of the storyline makes for an enjoyable view.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the fact that that app is free.  Then I can find books almost anywhere and download them to my app to ready.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I just love this show.  Rick Castle is so charming and daring, its like a modern day Sherlock Holmes with a dash of Indiana Jones adventure.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|As my son and husband love both Angry birds and Star Wars this is a great product.  It combines their two loves.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I had heard some negative feedback on this movie but I thought it was pretty good. It is entertaining and I enjoyed watching it.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|The series is awesome.  Therefore the DVD is awesome as well.  Awesomeness all over the place.  Pretty awesome DVD if you ask me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  It is a  creative and engaging story.  I liked the characters and hope it isn't what the world will become.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Beautifully written story. Colleen does it again, completely captures you with the story. I couldn't put it down until I was finished and wishing for more!
B005LAIGSM|5.0|Wonderful movie, heartwarming and a great love story, its amazing what love will do. My niece loved it for a Christmas gift
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|The movie is pretty good, only complaint is that it is really long and some parts drag on for far too long.
