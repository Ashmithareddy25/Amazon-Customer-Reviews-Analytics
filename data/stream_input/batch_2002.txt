B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is one of those books that you can`t stop reading .Amazing ! Such a beautiful love story.You need a box of tissues next to you before you finish reading ...you definitely going to need it ! I can`t wait to see the movie,I hope is as good as the book .You done wonderful job with this book Nicholas !
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Definitely a book I will be rereading every year. A book worth sharing in your company and especially among your leaders.<br /><br />Things simply done are best done. Simple isn't easy though. Go, rework your business! It's worth it!
B006MPKDUE|4.0|This is another intriguing story about Harry Bosch. I liked reading about his childhood dramas and what prompted him to solve this case. His twisting of the rules and sometime disregard for the LAPD establishment show the continuing pessimism of Harry. Nice to see him having a short but sweet relationship too--maybe there's a follow up to this--will have to keep the reader guessing.
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|I don't think I would ever spend 600 dollars on an Invicta, not because I don't think the watch is worth it, it works amazing and I enjoy the simplicity of it- I just don't think I would only because it is not a mechanical watch. Great watch for what it is worth, it is very aesthetically pleasing , and the large white face lets it be noticed! I always get some stares when I have my arm out. Don't hesitate to buy it because it is a nice watch for sure! Try to get over the fact that it isn't a Bullove or Omega and you'll be fine, because at the end of the day, it still tells time!
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|This is a new favorite for my family.  My sons love all the action, elves, animals, and such.  My wife and I love the more subtle humor that is above the kids' heads(nothing inappropriate however).<br /><br />Minor Spoilers:<br /><br />This movie has a whole new take on Santa where the role is passed on from generation to generation.  I find this very interesting as in most recent Santa lore, he and the elves are immoratal or have exteremely long lifespans.  I won't ruin the plot, just a minor detail that stands out to me.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and at least rent this one.  That is what we did and then went and bought it a day later.
B009MF56GC|5.0|The DVD arrived quickly and as advertised, Great service. Would purchase from buyer again.<br /><br />Would definitly recommend to other buyers.

1594488886|5.0|Khaled Hosseini's A Thousand Splendid Suns is a book that documents the turmoil that occurs in Afghanistan between 1959 and 2000.  This book is a sequel to Hosseini's equally impressive book: The Kite Runner. Hosseini's story is filled with twists and turns, seemingly random changes in plot that catch the reader off guard. It is a story that focuses less so on plot, and more on the characters. In the story there are many figures, each with their own distinct personality, each being injected into the story at different times, offering a quick change of pace for the readers.<br />The story revolves around two main characters, however. The first one we meet is Miriam. Miriam is a sad being, her life marked with tragedy rather than happiness. She has faced much adversity in her life, and this shapes her in a distinct way.  Miriam lives in a small house alone with her mother. When we first meet her, she is a small clueless child that does not understand the cruel world that she lives in. As she grows, she begins to comprehend her situation, and we feel empathy towards her. She lives far away from the busy city, and is isolated from the real world. Her father, Jalil, comes and visits her every so often, giving her a glimpse of the seemingly perfect world that he lives in, and that she wishes for. Miriam's mother however, disagrees with Jalil's parenting and feeds a different story to Miriam.  This uneasiness that Miriam feels, along with her mother's death, eventually prompts her to move to the city in search of her father.  She finds out that she is illegitimate and starts on a winding downward path in which she ultimately finds herself married to an older gentleman named Rasheed, who beats her mercilessly when she does not fulfill his demands.<br />In the second part of the book, we meet Laila, a young girl who grew up in the same city as Miriam, Kabul.  She lives a seemingly simple life as well: She had a spirited mother, a teacher for a father, and a boyfriend--Tariq--who is always by her side. But as with all characters in the story, her life soon takes a turn for the worst.  Tariq loses a leg, and is soon taken away from Laila after the Soviet Union invades Afghanistan. Kabul soon becomes a war zone, and Laila's life changed drastically. She too marries Rasheed. Miriam at first resents Laila, but they soon bond over the harsh treatment they receive from Rasheed. This strong relationship they build guides them through the hard times ahead. The story then follows the lives of the two women, as they constantly live in fear of Rasheed, who forces them to stay inside the house most days, and only allowing them to leave under supervision. Laila and Miriam eventually begin plotting an escape from Rasheed's grip.<br />A Thousand Splendid Suns depicts the troubles women faced in twentieth century Afghanistan through the eyes of two distinctly different, yet eerily related young women living in Kabul. The book starts out with separate stories that eventually get tied together in a very eloquent way. This is not a book for the faint-hearted, as it is filled with fluctuating emotions and cruelty towards women. Many times while reading the story, there were moments when I just had to put the book down, where to emotional strain was too much for me to read. A Thousand Splendid Suns covers a wide spectrum of topics, ranging from tension between genders to religion to lifestyles of the less fortunate. Hosseini's ability to incorporate so much meaning in the lives of two simple women is worth commending; he has an ability to breakdown all the cultural and religious beliefs one have, and leave you feeling for each characters loss or tragedy throughout the book. When reading this book, you feel immersed in the setting, feeling every emotion that Miriam or Laila feel; your stomach tenses up when Tariq is stolen from Laila; tears form in your eyes when Miriam's mother dies and she is left alone to fend for herself. The journey these women take isremarkable, and Hosseini does an excellent job of transferring it to paper and ink. A truly remarkable book that you will not be able to put down; definitely not to be missed!
B007704PRU|5.0|The first book left me very underwhelmed and a little angry to be honest!  I wasn't going to read the second, but I have some kind of book OCD where I have to continue a series if it is a series.  This book was amazing, I loved every work and it was one of those can't-put-it-down kind of books.  Read it!<br /><br />princessemzor.blogspot.com

B007KZY1YY|4.0|I enjoyed reading more about Christian's back story in this book, but it wasn't as exciting as the first book in the series.<br /><br />princessemzor.blogspot.com
0449807819|4.0|The truth and explanation of 'what ever happened to Salmond Rushdie', for those otherwise ignorant.<br />So beautifully written, one can become dissolved in the eloquence and epiphany of the words.<br />The who's who of the literary world can get muddling and boring, though the people one does know are exquisitely illuminated!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent book.  Keeps surprising you.  Had to order another book my Gillian right away.  This too, was an excellent read.
B005F3XV62|5.0|This is clearly a very funny movie with all the characters.  Great movie for the entire family.  It was exactly what I wanted and needed: a good laugh.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Considering I didn't like the two that followed.  Without all the written porn that everyone always goes on about, it was really quite a heart warming story.  Would recommend.<br /><br />princessemzor.blogspot.com
B00005LOUP|5.0|Extremely entertaining movie - facsinating sets and filming. The dialog will stick with you as it has with my grandchildren!

B004KZOXJA|3.0|But it could have been done better.  I did enjoy it, but I was kind of underwhelmed and when I got to the end, kind of angry.  Still would definitely recommend, make sure you also read the second book Pandemonium!<br /><br />princessemzor.blogspot.com

B0070Y46UY|4.0|Great book, I would love to read more when it is written. It's a fascinating read that kept me interested until the very last page!
B008N1V11U|5.0|I bought this for two young boys that I occasionally babysit and they loved it. I was worried that it would hang and I would spend most of my time rebooting the Kindle, but it never became an issue. The only issue we had was that there was only one Batman game. So I did what any indulgent babysitter would do. I downloaded the game on another Kindle and then there were 2 happy boys and I made it to the babysitter hall of fame. :)<br /><br />The graphics are amazing and even though I am not a big gamer, I am learning to play this.
B00ACFL69C|3.0|Good flick with interesting ending. Matthew does a good job here. A bit of a dark story and Hadden Church does a great job in his role.<br />G.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I would purchase this Pac-Man- Lite..  It is a blast to play, and a lot of compitition.. It will take your mind off of everything and has you focused on the game!

B00A2AU0KI|4.0|Good flick, Eastwood is awesome, unfortunately much the same character traits as Gran Torino so no real stretching here on his part. He makes a great crusty old fart. Amy is cute, funny, intelligent and vulneable. Interesting story line, enjoyable and believable characters with a good ending.
B009RWRIZ2|1.0|Am i the only person who is sick of Criterion charging outrageous prices and claiming that they are the best in the field of blu ray?<br />A previous offense was seen with UMBERTO D - they did not include the brilliant English language dub - seen on PBS through a Janus Films release in the 70's - one of the few instances where the dub was better than the original actors --<br />And now PINA - as an extra, we should (for the 45 dollar plus asking price) include the original COMPLETE dances?<br />SHAME on Criterion.<br />They need a wake up call -why should we go to YOUTUBE for the extras that should be on this disk?<br />Please explain Criterion!
B005KDWUFA|3.0|This was a gift.  I will not recommend it as I have not heard it.  It was requested and then fulfilled by me.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely loved this trilogy. Although now that I'm done I'm sad, I want more. There was so much more room to continue. Now it will be hard for me to find another book that sucks me in like this series did!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|The book tells the story of bravery, honor and risk taking for a higher calling. The story is written in a way that it makes you feel you are back in the days of WWII and gives important insight in to how most Germans were deceived by an evil dictator and his socialist party. I enjoyed the story most in how it revealed the impact of one man's decision on generations to come.

0307744434|3.0|\\"People see what they wish to see. And in most cases, what they are told that they see.\\"<br /><br />(The cover blurb is somewhat deceptive, so I am going to go into more detail than I typically do just to make sure the reader has a clear picture of what the book is actually about.)<br /><br />Two magicians choose two students and challenge each other to a game of sorts, to prove whose methods of teaching are the best. (This is not really a \\"duel\\", more like playing a game like Monopoly.) Celia is raised by her diabolical father, who cuts the tips of her fingers to teach her to use her innate abilities. Marco is adopted by the man in the grey suit, and taught from books. As they grow up, they are guided to make the Night Circus, a magical spectacle that takes their abilities and showcases them for the world to see. But each addition takes something away from the \\"competitors\\". It doesn't help when Marco and Celia finally meet and realize they are in love. The game does not allow love; one person must be named a winner, and the other must die.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a young boy named Bailey attends the Night Circus and is intrigued by the girl with red hair.<br /><br />I had read a ton of my friends' reviews on this and, based on their reviews, did not plan reading it. But it was selected for my Book Club's book, so I decided to give this a go anyway.<br /><br />One thing that pretty much every reviewer has said is how beautiful the world is, how gorgeous the descriptions and writing are. And that cannot be contested; Morgenstern is best when she is describing and inventing new mystical creations for her circus. This is by far the best part of the story; in fact, if I were to rate this solely on the beauty of the prose, the creativity of the circus, and the gorgeous passages setting the ambience, this would easily be 5 stars.<br /><br />But pretty writing isn't the only thing that makes a story; you need to have characters, an actual story, a beginning, middle, and end, and most importantly some sort of logic to the world of your novel. And in my opinion, this is where \\"The Night Circus\\" fails.<br /><br />I found it extremely challenging to grow attached to any of the characters. Celia's father was horrible - he cut her fingers so that she would be forced to heal them! He never acts paternal, instead settling on downright abusive! Marco's father-figure wasn't much better; he abandoned Marco multiple times and didn't even bother to know the boy's name.<br /><br />As for main characters, Celia and Marco, they are just all right. I liked Celia a bit more, probably because she was a female illusionist in a man's world, but she is very much an enigma. I didn't understand her sudden change to \\"love\\" Marco; I personally felt more connection between her and Thiessen. Marco is much the same way; I still don't understand why he felt the need to conceal his real face for Chandresh and the circus.<br /><br />Other characters include Isobel, Bailey, Poppet, Widget, and Tsukiko. Isobel had my pity, mostly for the poor way that Marco treats her for almost 2 decades. In the beginning, Bailey was quite dull, but towards the end, I felt he was the only character I could actually understand. Poppet and Widget likewise grew on me. And Tsukiko...God, I wish the woman would stop speaking in crypt-ese!<br /><br />One of the things that drove me most bonkers was the \\"luxurious romance\\" that the Washington Post brags about. My question: Where was that romance? Because the \\"romance\\" I saw was silly, based on insta-love, longing at a distance, and bland character interactions. I felt no passion between Marco and Celia, no desire, no connection. As I said above, I felt more of a connection between Celia and Thiessen than I did between Marco and Celia.<br /><br />The book also confuses \\"mystery\\" with \\"being vague\\". I swear, most conversations felt like the characters were purposefully not saying things just to confuse the reader. This held true for the narration as well, making this read particularly frustrating at the end where I was trying to understand what was happening and why. Why couldn't Marco and Celia know the rules to this \\"game\\"? What are the rules? How do they \\"play\\"? Who is the judge (I guess the initial magicians but the story never clarifies)? How is the circus tied to the game (I get the bonfire part, but how is Celia tied to the circus)? I had so many questions, and every time a character tried to \\"explain\\", I ended up more confused, as if I were reading a different language.<br /><br />The other mystery to me was how the magic in this world functioned. In the beginning, I kinda understood how things worked, but towards the end, the magic seems to be whatever the author needed at the time. Need a way to get out of a sticky situation? Magic. Need a character to end up halfway across the globe? Magic. I wouldn't have minded so much if I had a grasp of how the magic worked and it was consistent throughout the book.<br /><br />Ultimately, your enjoyment of the book will depend on what you are expecting. If you want an action-packed, intense battle between two magicians who have been training since their youth who fall in love despite being opponents (as the cover blurb hints this will be), this is probably going to be a disappointment to you. If you want an ambiance, a gorgeous world of creative magic, and are okay with a slow pace and characters that take a backseat to this magical circus, then you will probably really enjoy this book. Not my favorite book, but I wouldn't mind checking out Morgenstern's other works.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

B0048ZJOP0|5.0|Allthough some of the songs are more contemporary they are still good songs.  I love the New Years song and also Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane)/Housetop Celebration.  Oh Santa! is a new (up tempo) classic.  Other songs are great, too!

B009FZHYKU|5.0|The plot of &#34;zombie apocalypse survival&#34; is definitely overplayed in todays films and television.  This is why it amazes me that &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; has been able to successfully depicit various scenarios and circumstances that have spanned 3 seasons!  Good acting, great locations and awsome zombies in abundance!  I can't wait for the next season!!!!!!
B00AESN8XY|4.0|It's a little tricky at first, but once you learn how each plague can work it's a lot fun. I definitely recommend getting this app.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I would like this game a lot more if it didn't wind up costing so much to get started! Good Grief! It would be nice if you could play the game for a while, just to get used to how to play before having to buy stuff! Players wind up spending quite a bit before they know how to play the game. Other than that, the game is a good example of city management. I'm still a bit disappointed w/ it tho!
B00170F0WU|5.0|\\"Fantastic Acting, Wonderful Story, Great Photography and Exciting, Unusual and Original Music Score\\" would have been my review title if there was enough room. I will not repeat the story line because so many others have done so. The story is carried by the three main actors: Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and Natalie Portman, each of whom could have earned an Oscar for their acting in this film. Their characters are larger than life and each is a contradiction in themselves. Reno is a skilled professional hit man but can have childlike innocence. Oldman is a top DEA agent and a truly evil drug addict/dealer who loves Beethoven. Portman is a child with much innocence having been taken from her by her mother and father and the life style to which they exposed her. Oldman also robbed her of much innocence early in the film.  The tension and attraction among the three, which is enhanced by their personal contradictions, is the meat of the screenplay that these great actors take advantage of which makes this film so absolutely special. I have yet to see any other film that completely engrosses me in the same way. There is a good bit of violence, but each of the main characters is violent in their own way and accordingly, it does not seem gratuitous.  Also driving the violence is the significant drug presence surrounding Oldman's character and his subordinates as well as the violence inherent to Reno's profession. All of this is packed into less than two hours of intensity with little break. Unless you are completely turned off to violence, even that which is necessary to the story, this film should capture you from beginning to end. I was somewhat saddened that a young Portman had to be subjected to such themes and occasional language since I would never have allowed my children to view this film until their late teens, if then.<br /><br />The first time I saw The Professional, I clearly remember that the only thing I could say upon its conclusion was \\"WOW!\\". If you have not seen it, I highly recommend it and believe there is a good chance of it becoming one of your favorites as well.en it, I highly recommend it and believe there is a good chance of it becoming one of your favorites as well.

0553382179|5.0|This book makes one feel much better about oneself.  It's not just to help you get organized to clean house.  She gives you permission to feel good about yourself and that you are worth much more than you think you are.  I recommend it to anyone-male and female.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie is a funny movie that since Seth McFarlane wrote you know it is gonna be hilarious with off the wall comedy. This would not be a good idea to let kids watch this because of some of the jokes that are made in the movie

B008EL4YX6|2.0|I tend to really like this kind of puzzler, but I only played 10 or 11 levels before uninstalling this game. I think the problem was that the premise was clever enough, but the execution was sometimes poor, such that even after I had figured out how to solve a level, I would have to play it over and over again to get the timing or sequence right.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I enjoy the game but it sticks alot and I have to turn off my tablet and turn it back on then wait to reopen it, it can be a hassle at times.
B00095NX9G|5.0|Great drills, yoga, and combinations to practice.<br />This will work your butt off, I promise. And who better to learn from? Except maybe Zoe Jakes... and I have taken her classes too.

B0000524E5|5.0|I bought this dvd because I just love the movie.  I have been looking for this movie for a couple of years and finally looked here. Should have looked here earlier!
B009NPKTN6|3.0|The singing was great, the storyline good; however, there were scenes in this movie that were so awkward and uncomfortable they were painful to watch.

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|It's a good, good, good read. Then at the end, the twists..makes it a GREAT read. I devoured this book and loved the unexpected revelation.<br /><br />If you're picky about what you read and not easily entertained, you and I are one. Try this book. You may cry.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I give this  app, a very big high five.it gives me every kind of music from native American music to hip hop,to country it has everything you need.
B00846REIS|1.0|Don't waste your money. Terrible story, aggravating characters, and absolutely nothing happens in the story, same repetitive chapter after chapter.
B008I43DYU|4.0|Looks good. Many funtions available, way more than I need. Large easy the hit number keys. I would recommend this product.
0345803493|5.0|Ive read the first two books of these series and am addicted. Sure there is a lot of repetative statements but if you think about it in the aspect of your own lives, most people have repetative motions they may do frequently in situations. I realised my local store was sold out of book three so i overnighted it. I really love this series, its not just about the struggles between them and their sexual differences, as you continue reading each charactor seems to grow and evolve and its about their personal struggles, relationship struggles, personality problems, other peoples problems and it just draws you in. Im addicted, and and already mourning finishing book three this week, and hope tor number 4. LOVE IT. Its always interesting, and makes you wonder if Mr. Grey's charactor is based on a real person . . . Where is he!!

B004J4WN0I|5.0|I am a Dresden Files fan and since I read the last one of the series, I was really worried about what to read next. Previous reviews kept me away from the Druid Chronicles until I finally decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed at all. The fast paced action, the philosophy of the world, even the dialogs with Oberon (the main character’s dog) hooked me and I can’t wait to read the next one.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|We watched this movie again after many years and found it just as enjoyable as the first time.  A Classic!
B00AXVHHTI|5.0|I had to come here and give Amazon Instant Video some well deserved \\"Bravo\\" for the great price on this amazing series. I purchased the season pass in HD and it is almost 50% cheaper then iTunes.<br />I am great admirer of period drama and this one rates as one of the best. I can not wait to see the rest of the episodes.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Of course it wasn't as good as the first book but I enjoyed it none the less. It is an excellent escape from whatever realities you are facing.
0345803485|5.0|This book is one that i could not put down. Wow!!! The story just keeps you on your toes wanting to know what is next.  Can't wait to get the other two and start reading.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|You don't see the ending until the last chapter.  It was a quick read and very captavitating, it was hard to put down.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love it this game is very addictive , challanging and a great brain exeriser. would recommend to all my friends.
B002JC9RMY|5.0|Excellent product! This is an ideal item that anyone can buy with just a low price with honest guaranteed satisfactory.
B00078XGRO|5.0|We love sci-fi and Star Trek in this house, so this was a fun addition.<br />Love all the extras too.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|Before this one i bought 2 cheep ones (not apple product) and they didn't work, this one works perfect and thats all i care about. Only reason why i gave 4 stars it's because it came a little bit dirty. I cleaned it without any problem but it would be better if it came clean even if it's used already.
B00000DCHI|5.0|Had this in cassette tapes years ago, and wore them out. The CDs should last longer. I love this product.
0345803485|5.0|They hype was well worth the read. I caught several men on the beach this year trying to conceal that they were reading this book. I had to check it out for myself. great read. The seller also shipped this book verry quickly and in great condition
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|Make the game time longer from 15 minutes to 1 hour. That's it. Otherwise it will only be 2 stars and I will tell everyone not to buy your products.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|This thing didn't work right with my system.  It looked and felt and operated very cheaply.  I was very disappointed.  I got my money back.  I gave this one star because the return process is excellent.  No hassles no trouble.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|I got the recommendation for this from a friend and it was the exact thing I needed, I even paid the same thing for this FX 6100 than I would have paid for an FX 4100 due to a great deal. It simply works.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This is a dark , raunchy immature comedy. That i found to be very entertaining and laughed through out the entire movie. This movie is not for everyone.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This app is really awesome and fun. Really fun cool things you find in ppl's boards :) Mayb a few more categories would be nice :)
B00APUYWYA|1.0|It was rude and crude and vulgar and not worth watching. My daughter turned it off right away. I am so proud of her!
B00005J6T1|5.0|This album is a must to anyone who loves 80s music or Madonna for that matter. Its the beginning of the superstars career and represents the hard work and struggle that she went through to obtain her stardom! This album has incredible beats right from the New York club scene and a very edgy sound that is unlike any other for that time. One of my best purchases!!!
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Throughout the book, Dr. Alexander states that the &#34;reality&#34; of his experience while in the coma negates all other explanations--other than that he really was in heaven.  Yet it took him some time after coming out of the coma before he could articulate some of these very &#34;real&#34; experiences.  For example it took him two months to decide that the girl on the butterfly was his dead sister.  I, for one, don't think that &#34;realities&#34; reconstructed by a healing brain can be trusted.  Strong Conviction is often wrong.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I am so happy to play this game. The point of the game is very simple, but getting good at it takes practice. I find when I have a few minutes of time this fills it perfectly. the controls work nicely. However the one thing I have noticed is balls can travel behind other balls already in play. Not a horrible thing as I have used the feature a few times, but it shouldn't work. overall thanks to the dev for making a game I play the most.
B008EZVNO0|4.0|I am a big Van Morrison fan and I usually buy what he puts out.  I enjoyed this CD, it's a little on the jazz side.

B005WUHAX8|2.0|It's a great sealed case for keeping the elements out of the phone.  No water, dust, makeup or other contaminates have made it inside the case which makes it great when you have a small child.<br />The downside to the case is that it keeps sound in as well, and it is very difficult to tell if the phone is on silent or not.  Couple the fact that you cannot visual the switch position and cannot always hear the text or phone alerts and you'll eventually start missing phone calls and text messages.
1416575464|5.0|I was so sad when this magazine went out of business, but I am so glad that they came out with this book to ease my woes. Full of great ideas and design inspiration. LOVE IT.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The plot has a great idea and when you think it is figured out, they add a twist to it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have seen very few games that appeal as much to my mother as to my 15 and 10 year old sons.  Great fun.

B008WCP2PG|5.0|It came fast & I watched it the same day! There weren't any scratches & it worked perfectly. Great product! But it has a horrible story line, I only watched it for the strippers.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read. Very well written. Engrossing story line. Well worth the time and money on it. Movie was accurately done.
B001NLL0RW|5.0|Love the Sigma Force series! They are never disappointing and always action packed. Yet another great book in the series!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Hard to get into, once you do it's really good. Kinda different ending, makes me want to see the movie
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These headphones produce exciting base without drowning out the quiet moments. They are very exciting. I liked them a lot.
1451695195|5.0|If anyone has ever lost a loved one, or deeply pondered what happens to us when we die, I think Eben Alexander's book Proof of Heaven gives the reader a great deal of comfort and hope.  This book was a short and easy read.  It was personal, warm, and not at all preachy.  Alexander makes his argument for life after death from the position of the converted.  He is a neurosurgeon who had always been skeptical of other accounts of near death experiences, until he had his own.<br /><br />Like most scientists or medical professionals who refute the notion of life after death, Alexander had always believed that the near death experiences, which thousands of people have reported, could always be attributed to the processes our dying brain goes through in such a trauma.  This all changed once Alexander had his own experience.<br /><br />Being a highly respected neurosurgeon, Alexander is able to refute many of these dismissive explanations.  He explains that when he was in his coma, experiencing the afterlife, his neocortex, which would be responsible for creating such fantasies, had completely shut down.  It would have been impossible for his brain to come up with the visions he says he experienced.<br /><br />Alexander's narration weaves back and forth between personal stories about his family and professional life, the medical ordeal which led him to a coma, and his experience in the afterlife.<br /><br />One thing that made his descriptions of Heaven believable to me was that he often prefaced them with a disclaimer that his description would in no way get close to the actual beauty and feeling of the afterlife.  He states repeatedly that any attempt at putting it into words would be condensing the enormity of what he saw into tiny, unrelatable human terms.  To me, that sounds like a man who experienced something so majestic that there is no way to describe it in this world that would even come close to doing it justice.<br /><br />While he is trying to convince the reader that Heaven is real, Alexander's book is not overwhelmingly argumentative.  His purpose is not so much to fight against disbelief as it is to inspire hope; to provoke us to think differently about the world we inhabit, reflect on what is awaiting us, and to get us thinking about what we can do in our own lives to draw ourselves closer to God.  The following quote was, in my opinion, the most beautiful expression of what Alexander was trying to drive home in this book:<br /><br />\\"So I was communicating directly with God? Absolutely.  Expressed that way, it sounds grandiose.  But when it was happening, it didn`t feel that way.  Instead, it felt like I was doing what every soul is able to do when they leave their bodies, and what we can all do right now through various methods of prayer or deep meditation. Communicating with God is the most extraordinary experience imaginable, yet at the same time it`s the most natural one of all, because God is present in us at all times.  Omniscient, omnipotent, personal - and loving us without conditions.  We are connected as One through our divine link with God. \\" (p. 161).<br /><br />I've always been a believer in God and the afterlife, but this book helped me gain even more introspection into what all of that might entail.  I would highly recommend this book to believers, and open-minded non believers alike.  I think it was inspiring and provided a great deal of comfort and hope.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|Good read,I enjoy the behind the scenes stuff that goes on isports. Billy Beane is one sharp mind. Go A s

B0087JTAKW|4.0|I've read other books by Mitch Albom and find them all to read about the same. But the stories are so descriptive and fantastic that they always keep my attention.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I purchased this sport watch as a gift for my partner.  I researched many options but kept coming back to the Garmins.  Many of our friends use this brand as well.  Although it appears that the setup can be a little challenging he seems to have figured it out and now enjoys the benefits of the watch immensely.  I would recommend this watch to anyone who asked.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Good cast of characters, good dialogue, and lots of action. The only negative a lot of the scenes were very dark and hard to keep up with the action, but still I would recommend it.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|wish it were ten volumes. This is great reading, reccomend it highly, watch the series on tv also, it goes well together
B0037HOWKW|5.0|This was a perfect gift for my granddaughter who is a piano student and was jealous of her brother getting all of his lego kits for Christmas.  She is a little older and loved it!
B005LZW8FO|5.0|My father got this film to watch it himself from redbox. He ended up not liking it since it wasn't an action-filled sci-fi. I saw the first few minutes and was immediately drawn in to it. Its a sheer beautiful story that reflects emotionally charged characters which are magnificently portrayed in turbulent chain of events. This film is a masterpiece. Definitely in my top favorites if not my most.
B002RL7W9W|5.0|Love doing business with you a great way to do the shopping i am on to something good on time and well budgeted .

B005J7K964|4.0|The outer casing (or box) has surface scratches all over it that doesn't cut into the box itself really, but scrapes off the design/image(s) on the box (Silver Scratch-Off Lottery Ticket style) which seems to peel right off without much effort at all. The inner casing (Blu-Ray Case itself) is indeed shrink wrapped as a new one would be. If Amazon will allow, I might decide to edit this review to include my take on the movie itself, it's picture quality and sound quality. I bought this movie because I wanted to see the motion picture that inspired Jacque Fresco (founder of the Venus Project) to become the insightful, thought-provoking, and passionate man that he is. The dystopian future depicted in this movie inspired him on many levels to want to help bring about a better future for mankind, and he didn't wait around for someone else to do it. He took it upon himself to take the initiative and go for it! And for this, we have Metropolis' creators to thank. The motion picture that started it all. :~D
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun, brain teaser, good graphics, lots of missions.  You are a droplet and must navigate with slide movements.  As you progress you have to navigate around spikes, portals, blocks that move ect......  Good game highly recommended.
B001MTENOC|5.0|This book provides an interesting picture of the Afterlife compiled from hundreds of case studies. I couldn't put it down. For me, it had a ring of truth and it is something I would recommend all 'seekers' should read
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Cubistry is an addictive game. It is hard to put down, but freezes up once in a while.You keep trying to better yourself.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|This is a fun way to play a quick game of Carcassonne and  for the most part it plays really well. However the scoring  is very glitchy and  points  are  not given at least a few time  every game. Some more  expansions would  be nice  too. I will give  it 5 stars when the  scoring is  fixed.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Great quality, it was the 45th anniversary combo, I ordered 2 sets, one was for a gift and they loved it too, dvd plus blue ray disc, and ery fast shipping, highly recommended
030758836X|3.0|It is difficult to write a review of this book and not give too much away as it truely is an exciting read. I really liked the way that this book was written from two different points of view, alternating back and forth from the husband (Nick) and wife (Amy), who have marital issues amongst other personality issues. The author hits the nail on the head with so many of these normal, everyday marital problems and is able to put them into words, which I thought was funny in itself. The author clearly did a lot of research and is very talented and just when I thought that this book was going to be fairly predictible, about half way through, I was sucked in and in for a wild ride. This was a very creative story with lots of twists that are very unique, especially the scavenger hunt that Amy sends Nick on every year as well as how Amy thinks of everything to hide her tracks and her positive pregnancy test. The author did an outstanding job creating Amy's character and whatever psychological diagnosis in the DSM IV manual that she has. It was very creative, well written and mind stimulating. I was, however,very disappointed with the ending. It was not congruent with the story and I was hoping for one last twist to seal the deal, since there were so many shocking surprises throughout the meat of the story. The end was a let down (pretty much all of part III), but this story is worth reading for the creative storyline. I could see this becoming a movie at some point. This story will frighten men in the way that Fatal Attraction did back in the 80s.
B003V1WTMM|4.0|Ok, this is about the 3rd of Kate Morton's books that I've read.  It was a bit tedious in places, the storyline not as tight as it could have been, but (damn) I can hardly put the book down.  Even though these books follow a similar trend-- back and forth historically, British, WWII, women friends and family with somewhat weak male characters, I love it.  I do commend her for tying up any loose threads that could come from such back and forth novels.
B00275EHJG|5.0|We bought this to add to our collection of toy story movies.  It's one of my favorites of all time and the sequels, especially this one, are as good or better than the first.  What a great story.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Bought this for my newborn grandson and he loves it! I had to buy a second one because he throws a fit when his mom takes it to make sure it's kept clean!

B009VB7P6G|5.0|The girls really got into this movie.  They started debating on which type of faire they wanted to be.  Nice
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|for some reason i was not expecting to like this movie.  maybe the description made it sound boring or predictable.  i was so wrong.  reason number 1 to love the fall:  it is indescribably beautiful, the aesthetics of each scene were so carefully thought out and put together.  reason number 2:  even though the movie is gorgeous, it isn't one of those art films that hipsters sit around chatting about.  the acting and story line have mass appeal.  reason number 3:  the actors, especially the little girl, are so real.  the scenes between the little girl and the stunt man are poignant and spontaneous because apparently nothing was really scripted.<br />do yourself a favor and watch this achingly good movie.  several times.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|It contains some adult themed material so be warned.  Check it out on your own before letting your kids see it.
B005R32L66|5.0|Skype is always awesome, i like it better than tango they fixed the bug where it showed sideways on my pad, but now it's fine
B009HEJXFS|3.0|I though that the story was too small in scope.  All the characters were too interconnected.  Effects can't carry the whole film.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I found myself up late sacrificing sleep at points in this book. I enjoy Baldacci's writing and this book was no exception.
B004X75RK4|4.0|Something cute and funny.  It has no real life or death dilemmas and could be told hundreds of ways... I short it will put a smirk on your face.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A bit different than some of Grisham's previous book, The Racketeer is told from the POV of our protagonist. And revenge is at the heart of his racket.<br />The question is: is he a good guy or a bad guy?<br />The story moves along at a good clip, keeping the reader intrigued and guessing our hero's next move to see if you can stay one step ahead of him.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This little free app has become one of my absolute favorites. I use it at home to create a relaxing atmosphere that takes me away from my city surroundings, to fall asleep to, or out and about to create my own private, peaceful bubble.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|I bought this for a computer build i did with x-mas money. Great Processor but be warned, it DOES NOT come with a heatsink so you will have to buy an after market one. Without overclocking it scores 7.7 on the windows index.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I first read this book when I was ten years old, 43 years ago. I was delighted w it then and have remained so each of the half dozen times I have read it. The imagery and gentle tones of the author  keep this story one of my favorites.
B008MEM24S|5.0|We always run through a few new games that might be fun every few weeks. This game is like another one that my daughter has but with the characters from the show. Its fun and another problem solving game for kids. We have fun taking turns and seeing who gets to the next level!!

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This is on  of the best books that I have ever read, and all the way through it had my attention. I never finished a whole book, an  this is the first one I have finished. Everything about this book was  amazing. I would recommend it to anyone who has had it rough in the past because that's how I related to the book myself.
B001MTENOC|5.0|This is fascinating read. The subject covered like no other book I've read.<br />Personally I found this quite comforting and now that I've  read the whole book and thought and discussed this with number of people I feel this may be al detailed view of the after life pieced together from a large number of case studies.<br />There is a lot of detail here. Read it and judge for yourself. I personally have far less fear of death from reading this book and feel somehow my take on reality has been shifted ever so slightly. I feel more comfortable with the daily drama that surrounds us. Less fear, less threatened by change. More connected to my instincts and inner voice. I was delighted to find that years after this book Michael Newton now has numerous therapists around the world who are certified in his particular brand of hypnotherapy. I may do this to get to know my soul identity, guides and fellow playmates.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Although others may not have the same opinion as me about their travels, i appreciate hearing the reviews of those who have been to places, events, attractions, etc I am planning to visit.  I frequently refer to tripadvisor.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I know this book was written for women in particular and most women I know have read the book and found themselves all excited about this material. I approve of the effect it's had on them. I found the book boring, predictable and poorly written. Personally not as graphic as I would have liked and If I had to read about her &#34;Inner goddess doing another back flip&#34; I could simply throw up. What can I tell you. You may enjoy this dip of a toe into the world of domination and very light S&M. I'm pretty sure there are quite a number of reads more worthy of your time, imagination and attention.
0738711500|4.0|I bought my original set of the Easy Tarot Kit from the bargain rack when I worked at an old Waldenbooks.  I was curious about tarot, and the materials are well-suited to someone looking to dip their toe in.  I found the guide to be warm, positive, and helpful in learning both the spreads and interpretations of the cards.  Recently, I tried the \\"Life Spread\\", and enjoyed the breadth and depth of the reading.  I missed an important detail, though:  two full decks are required for that spread, because one part of the reading is solely from the Major Arcana, and one from the full deck.  I'm ready to purchase a second deck for this reason, although most could be happy with the kit as it comes.<br /><br />I also endorse Janet Boyer's review of the kit.  The cards are expressively illustrated, but I bought the kit as a whole to learn, and have been satisfied with that purchase.  Given the choice, I might have selected a different deck for illustrations.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I found this novel slow at first. It seemed to drag o . When Sky finally put the pieces together with help from Holder then it became a good read.

B005HPY8LU|5.0|This is the Kelly Clarkson we fell in love with. I was dissapointed in the past, with songs like 'My life would suck without you'. She's back to her sweeter, more poetic power ballads. - After I've had mine a while I see there's a new release. So, hold out for the deluxe version. It has three new songs, and the Jason Aldean duet. Or, I can make you a deal on my copy...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Such a good read. Very unexpected twists. Very strong and emotional book. I highly recommend if you like romance and drama
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|Money well spent, so good I'd read it again. Practical and sound advice I can implement immediately and change my success blue print for ever! Thanks a million Harv.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was so good it was so funny and entertaining.<br />Jeff Kinney really got to my funny bone. Thanks Jeff !
B001VLXNLU|5.0|This book is awesome and I don't read a lot of book. It is dark and easy to keep up with. I love the way the author weight this book.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|The movie is great, but I was  not aware that this particular DVD had subtitles which is very distracting.  I will try to return/replace it with one that does not have subtitles.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Well a friend of mine suggested it to me, awhile back and I'm just finished it. The way the story is written ties you into the life of Hazel. You're sad when she has a down day and you're happy when she is. She becomes part of your life. I really enjoyed this novel.
B00006EXL5|5.0|The cd is in amazing quality and it came with the bonus cd. Though I did not expect it to come from Germany i had truthfully forgotten I had ordered it until it came but it was still on time.

B009329ZF2|5.0|This was an incredible movie. I really enjoyed watching it. There was nothing that I disliked about it besides I didn't want it to end!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|A friend recommended that I watch this show; I saw part of the 1st episode of season 3, and realized that I had to see it from the beginning; to see the character development and more of the background leading up to the 3rd season.  I could not stop watching this.  There is not one actor or actress who was not perfectly fitted to their role. The costumes, setting, dialogue, story- ALL enthralling, captivating.  It should be at the top of everyone's list to watch.  My only fear is that this series will eventually end.  I hope it's not for many, many more seasons.
B007XF0X16|5.0|I'll keep this short at sweet. This movie was fun.<br /><br />That's really all there is to it. Yes, it's steeped in mythology, and it might not follow these stories in a 100% accurate fashion.  But it doesn't matter.  This is an action packed ride that has you watching chimeras, cyclopses, and gods trying to stop one man.  Think of it as God of War on a much smaller scale.  Go into this movie expecting nothing more than a fun ride, and you will enjoy it.  Also, if you saw the first movie and were disappointed, still give this one a shot.  I almost passed this one up since I thought the first movie was a bore.  I'm glad I didn't.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This saga is like a mix of Harry Potter and Twilight with a little bit of actual sex appeal! I love the country gothicness of it!
B005LAII80|5.0|First of all, I know that I made a very bold statement in using that title.  Allow me to explain.<br /><br />As far as I am concerned, Dredd is indeed one of the greatest action movies of all time.  Of course, this is incredibly subjective, but to me, it hits it out of the park.  When I'm watching a straight-up action movie, I'm looking for a few things.  First and foremost, I want realistic, but not gratuitous action.  For example, the Expendables movies are amazing for what they are, but it's all very gratuitous and over the top.  It makes for a fun time, but it just won't make me want to watch the film over and over again.  I'll just skip to the scenes I liked.  In Dredd, the action comes fast and furious, but no scene feels superfluous.  What we get in Dredd is an incredibly violent action movie, but every move Dredd makes is simply to complete his goal, and nothing else.  It continually drives the plot and makes the audience identify with both Dredd himself, and his new rookie partner, Anderson.<br /><br />The long and short of it is this - Dredd doesn't pull any punches.  Every scene has a purpose.  I can't tell you how impressive and refreshing it was for me to NOT see a romantic sub-plot develop between Dredd and Anderson.  That just wouldn't be believable, but it would certainly fall in line with a very well-established action movie trope.  Bravo to the film makers here.<br /><br />I also want to touch on the source material and how this movie relates.  As other reviewers have mentioned, this could be the most faithful adaptation of a comic in movie history.  This film nails Judge Dredd as a character.  He is a faithful public servant, hardened by the harsh word in which he lives.  He is not devoid of emotion or feeling, but he knows how to put it aside to do what he has to do.  No doubt, the characters in this film were well-written, but Karl Urban needs a special mention here.  If any of you are jaded by Stallone's portrayal of Dredd, then you can breathe a huge sight of relief.  Karl Urban is amazing.  Dredd is a hard character to pull off.  As I mentioned, he needs to be almost cartoonish in how cold and calculating he is, but he can't be made into a robot.  I can't think of anyone being able to pull of this balancing act quite as believably as Urban does in this film.  He has made a fan for life in me.<br /><br />So to summarize, for action-lovers out there, you can't go wrong with Dredd.  As I have mentioned, its pacing is perfect and its action is sublime.  Expect a visceral and heart-stopping romp through one night from hell in the life of Judge Dredd.  And all the while, looking through the filter of one of the most beautifully shot films in recent memory.a huge sight of relief.  Karl Urban is amazing.  Dredd is a hard character to pull off.

B002E66C6E|5.0|Loved this movie. So what if it's historically inaccurate. It's a blast. I never liked Matthew McConaughey till I saw U-571. Very suspenseful. Great cast.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|First thing is first - don't expect much in the way of plot development in this story.  A group of a police unit (like a SWAT team) are raiding a criminally-run building.  The building is run by a crime-lord and at first, we are to assume that taking him down is the ultimate goal.  As we go on, we see that our main character, a member of the police unit, is actually trying to extract his criminal brother from the building.  That's basically it.  There is a very small twist at the end, but plot-wise, this is pretty thin.  It's basically an excuse to drive the action.<br /><br />And my god, the action.  I'm an MMA addict/student for the past 15 years, and for me, the fight scenes in this flick are sublime.  The characters are practicing Silat, which in many ways resemble muay thai.  In many ways, this movies does for silat what Ong Bak did for muay thai.  The action is fast and incredibly brutal.  No shaky camera work here either.  We get to see these fights unfold without any trickery.  There are no sommersaulting kicks pr magical punches here.  These people are fighting for their lives, and damn it, it's convincing.  The shootouts are also very well-done.  There isn't a ton of gunplay, but what is there is satisfying.<br /><br />Long story short, if you love action movies and haven't seen this, I can all but guarantee you won't be disappointed.  And be prepared for one of the most badass fights ever put to celluloid as this films comes to a close.  I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie, and the finale finally just knocked me off my seat.  Awesome stuff.

The initial volume in this series is [[ASIN:0812511816 The Eye of the World]].<br /><br />In the previous volume, Lan encountered Bulen -- the son of a Malkieri and a Kandori -- in the Borderlands.

Read and enjoy!<br /><br />-Arthur W. Jordin
B006LR0XLM|4.0|Easy to use, functions well, photos and videos retain their quality/clarity, and it has been very stable and reliable so far!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is one that teachers should suggest to their teen students. It is an honest and heartfelt story that deals with the ways in which life is sometimes unfair. Very powerful indeed. Beautifully written.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|I haven't played this myself but both of my kids have this game and love playing it.  The graphics seem to be great. It did freeze up a couple of times so it loses 1 star for that.
B006BG7RI0|5.0|This is a wonderful collector's item.  It has much to be desired by a fan of this classic movie.  The price is right, the movie is beautifully restored with the new digital transfer with an Introduction by Lauren Bacall<br />The deleted scenes and outtakes are real jewels. The two documentaries, &#34;You Must Remember This&#34; and &#34;Bacall on Bogart,&#34; hosted by Lauren Bacall add to the collection in a special way.<br />Stephen Bogart and Ingrid Bergman's daughters Pia Lindstrom and Isabella Rosselini have their parental memories that while I have heard Stephen Bogart speak on the subject of his father, I had never heard these clips from Pia and Isabella.<br />As a Looney Tunes fan I appreciated the The Looney Tunes homage &#34;Carrotblanca.&#34;<br />The Photos, press materials, studio correspondence, memorabilia, musical outtakes, and production history are an added bonus.
0062183591|5.0|This book was everything that I was hoping for -- the style and readable prose that made me fall in love with Predictably Irrational, more fascinating behavioral experiments, and a down-to-earth presentation that shows any businessperson lots of opportunities for practical application of the information.<br /><br />Fascinating in itself, this is also an amazing book to read and then use to consider your own behavior -- why am I willing to take pens from the bank, but would never dream of stealing a quarter? Marvelous and insightful. Everyone should read this!
B000068FWC|3.0|I already have this album that I bought back in 1980.  But I wanted a \\"fresh\\" copy (vinyl), so I got this.<br /><br />Good:<br /> - You've got to love the weight of the 180g vinyl!<br /> - It sounds just like my original copy.<br /><br />Bad:<br /> - It sounds just like my original copy.  The highs are over-modulated.  The dynamics and clarity don't really come close to my older CD version.<br /> - The record (brand new) came pretty warped.  It's completely playable and I'll keep it.  I just didn't expect this from a new copy- especially a 180g one.<br /> - The record came with a hand print and a scratch that looks like someone dropped it on the edge of a table.  The damage seems superficial and I'm not worried about it.  But still, it seems to speak of the QC here.<br /><br />I just bought this for nostalgia sake so I wasn't expecting ultimate level fidelity.  If you are, you might want to wait and see if MOFI will re-release this.  At least the price is very fair.  (Note that this is for the vinyl copy.)
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|If loved this game it is so fun and was free. It's a pretty good game to be free. I mean come on must games that are free agent as good , but this one is pretty good. I especially like how you can create your own stick man. I loved it and I love to play it. I agree with all you all that said it was a great g ame

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I use these headphones EVERY day as I'm a radio disc jockey. These first off sound FANTASTIC, and they are the most rugged headphones you'll find. I've tried MANY more that cost a whole lot more, and they don't hold a candle to these! I HIGHLY recommend you get a pair!
B009X2CUYA|4.0|Very interesting Author, I enjoyed reading this book as well as her other 3. Looking forward to reading her last book.
B007V65R54|5.0|This book will be fun reading for anyone. Even (or maybe especially) as a science graduate student in the Earth Sciences, I feel like this book is giving me a better big-picture understanding of the current state of modeling/forecasting, and how human biases and judgement errors are often a primary factor in why many predictions fail.<br /><br />Silver's approach of picking a few examples and exploring them in depth means that readers will really learn and take away some of the lessons from each story. Very well written and hard to put down!

B0044DEAUA|4.0|As a BlueTooth device for use in my car this speakerphone works great.  I can hear with no issues, and the people on the other end of the call tell me that the call quality is very good.  This is saying something because I use this speakerphone in a Corvette that has an exhaust system that is louder than stock, and I drive without the roof panel at times.  So why the 4 stars and not 5?  For some stupid reason they put the charging port on the back of the device instead of the side.  This prevents me from being able to keep the device plugged in, and forces me to run it on charge all the time.  By simply moving the charge port to the side  I could have easily hardwired the device into my car and would never have to worry about charging it.
B009E3EY4M|1.0|A song and a half into this and I knew I had fallen for the hype and wasted $30.  It doesn't take long to realize why Robert Plant said NO WAY to a tour after this.  Nice to see he still has a shred of integrity left.  It's a quaint reminisce of times gone by, but as far as I can see and hear,  Robert and Bonzo's kid are the only ones with musical chops left.  A wonderful DTS mix, I don't think so.  Volume up with gobbs of distortion and noise, with big arena echo,  so you really can't hear how sloppy the playing is.  JPJ is totally missing in the mix.  He really sound that bad????  Sorry to all you 5 star reviewers, but this night should have been kept in the can.  I'll be very suprized if I ever take the time to spin these disc's again.  Sad and dissapointing, this is.  A dust collector.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book is filled with loads of witty observations and funny stories. There's no real plot or story line, but I was laughing so hard I didn't even mind. Tina's got a vocab though, so pull out your old SAT prep books for reference.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|All my favorite songs from the OBC recording (plus &#34;Suddenly&#34;; a new tune) done up in a fresh new way.

B004X60QE2|3.0|Eureka is pleasant to watch but definitely lightweight stuff. It's like the Brady Bunch going sci-fi. Disappointing for me after having just watched enthralling series like \\"The 4400\\" and \\"Sliders\\" but still entertaining to some degree.

B0083DJWGO|5.0|I recommend reading it to freshen up ones perspective on things. In his writing Taleb is quite aggressive and I find him being speculative at times, nevertheless I think he is touching on many very important problems in how the world and individuals are functioning today.

She loved it. It arrived on time and undamaged I was extremely happy because I was racing the Christmas clock!!
B002PZC8BM|4.0|This is a fun show. It will make you laugh without too much drama. Yet, it is underpinned by a dramatic & somewhat intense plot line that holds it's water even as the seasons progress. (I am writing this after having viewed the entire series to date AND I am still pleased with the series).
B002YP4FOQ|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend who is a serious record collector and musician.  He was impressed by the quality of the product. I was grateful at how fast it was shipped, because it was a late buy for a present!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read. It was romantic sad thrilling and surprising a beautiful book that captures real life and emotions
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this. I had been hesitating about purchasing this book because of the reviews concerning the ending. While I agree that it was not the most satisfying ending, I thought it was appropriate. It works. It was not some kind of cliffhanger, but it was not terrible.<br /><br />The main characters were well-developed and the supporting characters were equally lovable or \\"hateable\\"! I found myself hating and loving and hating certain characters throughout the course of the book.<br /><br />If you like page turners and unexpected plot twists, you will love this book as much as I did!!! Enjoy!!!
0545425115|5.0|I loved this book! It was a little different from the movie, but it still kept you on the edge of your seat. It's a disturbing topic to think about, but still interesting and entertaining to read. The author does a good job of showing the unique bond between each of the characters.<br /><br />Every year, one young man and one young woman,each from one of the twelve districts, must compete against each other in the Hunger Games. Peeta Mellark and Katniss Everdeen are chosen to represent District Twelve. Each person chosen to participate must fight for their life against the others. It is very difficult to win, and some of them need help along the way. There are many brutal battles that occur, resulting in more dealths. Peeta and Katniss come out alive, in the end. There are the only ones, out of all 24 who participated, that are alive.<br /><br />This was a great book. I can't wait to start reading the other books from the series! It's a neat story of survival, and it keeps you entertained. I never wanted to put this book down! :)
B007SUW24W|5.0|Ed Sheeran is absolutely amazing! I first saw some of his stuff on you-tube. When I received the CD it was great I listened to it in my car for months. I did a little more research about him and later purchased all of his import CD's from the UK. Even though they are a tad expensive if you love Ed Sheeran it is worth it.
B00A6N8YTU|5.0|This movie was right as what is really going on in the world. I didn't like the parts about their sex life but sex is in almost every movie made now days, even PG rated movies. But the part about using their money to help people in need was verry true in most cases. It's a shame that pot is a criminal offence, what if corn was a criminal offence? I smoke but that should not be a crime like it is, For God's sake, we have had several Presidents who have smoked pot. Our first President has it in his Diary that he grew pot, it says that he was late seperating the male from the female, and the only reason for this is to make the plant more potent. We abort kids before they are born, yet we made pot illeagle for our own good. this is the true definition of bull[...]. This movie tells the truth, but they could have left the sex out.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I got his to compare to Battle Royale movie with the Japanese students going after each other. It was well made and good movie. It looked like a Hollywood movie, Battle Royale I thought was done a little better though some of the scenes were comical at best. This movie is still must for movie lovers.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Have been recommending this series since before I finished the 1st book. Have also seen the movie & found it to be terrible.....No character development, no background, nothing of the rich details of the book. This one kept me up late on work nights, but so worth it!!!

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Fifty Shades of Grey.  Way too much sex.  It seems to be a story about a sadist and his victim, who doesn't realize what a victime she is.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Perfect Christmas gift for an affordable price. These films are all great separately, so it's nice to have them all in one package.
B002ZG981E|5.0|***Spoilers***<br /><br />It's difficult to understand how to approach this review, being that the film, itself, is so complex.. Is the linear story of a heist/inception of the Robert Fischer character really what's going on?.. Or, is their a deeper meaning?.. Consider the notion that maybe the Robert Fischer character isn't really the one the story is about, and that the \\"inception\\" is being planted elsewhere, and that the Fischer character is really a plant used to play out an elaborate psycho-therapy on the real target, Cobb himself.. This is a story about living with regret, and how it can consume us, and it's my belief the whole story is a dream that Cobb cannot wake up from.. The \\"inception being his kids, which of course, do not really exist (why would Moll and Dom choose to explore limbo for decades, with 2 young children?), they were only planted there (inception) by Moll, who is really still alive..<br /><br />This is why the ending is so powerful, cause the walking away from the still spinning totem represents Cobb's release from his despair.. A truly brilliant film..
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Couldn't put the book down until I was finished. Highly recommend this as part of the trilogy. It was great.
B004HD61KE|5.0|As an avid reader of James Rollins, I especially enjoyed this book as it kept the story in the United States. It was a nice change of pace from the storylines that take us all over Europe. Fun read especially for the US history buffs.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|I watched it on HBO and was absolutely enthralled.  It was beautifully done.  I actually purchased the set for my son's birthday.  He was extremely happy to receive it.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|The book in kindle version is a little boring to read, I excepted a more friendly and colorful edition.  Hope other kindle books are better.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is a must have for Downton Abbey fans. Great lead in to current third season. Also a great value.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|I found the writing to be aimed at young adults, which it should be.  I am an old fart but still have enjoyed the first two in the series and am now reading Mockingjay and enjoying it as well.
0345803485|1.0|I gave up, I just couldn't take it anymore. This is going to the trash because I would be too embarrassed giving it away. I wouldn't want my friends to think I would read such garbage. Where did all the hype come from, I just don't get it? The author must have a good publicist, because honestly she has no talent. Reading this one would think it was written by a 16 year old. Quite frankly I found it immature, trashy, and a total waste of paper and ink.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This app makes you unlock your device before turning it on; it is bad if you live with someone and you don't want to wake them up. But other wise good if you don't have a password on your device.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This about a boy who has a different  face than you or me. I didn't dislike anything at all. It was a book that could make you laugh and cry at the same time. If you don't like that then you should not not read it. Ages 9 to 12 would like it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|When I started reflected in you I never imagined how much better it would be from the first one. This book exceeded my expectations! I cannot get enough of the heart gripping moments Sylvia brings us to in the journey of Eva and Gideon! Not sure how we can wait for book 3! Great job onceagain
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app so much I think if you're looking for a talent meeter for drawing and designing you should get this app. it offers a wide variety of fun and no extra cost required so what r y waiting fir just buy it yea you the one starring at the screen lol jk<br />ee bubblez
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland is simply terrific - riveting, extremely well written and well-acted.  Keeps you at the edge of your seat.  Claire Danes is particularly great.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The story is immediately engaging.  Having all 5 stories in one book makes it easy to race through the stories to see what happens.  I was glad I purchased this, even though it's probably YA fiction.  Looking forward to reading FIRST SHIFT and SECOND SHIFT to see what happens next.
B000F8O35U|4.0|The Sea Witch was a bit scary for my 3 year old but otherwise a classic! My 5 year old loves it!

B005LAIIA8|3.0|Sometimes you just have to ask \\"What in the heck were they thinking?\\" Making this movie in black and white makes no sense whatsoever, besides I guess the fact that the original was in black and white. But why? It gives nothing to this movie. In fact, as at least one other reviewer has stated, it is distracting. I love old black and white movies, but this is 2013. We have color now. Use color! It doesn't offer any nostalgic flavor to the movie, whatsoever, in my opinion. I sat through the first 15 minutes wondering, hoping, praying it would soon change to color, thinking it would be just the first few minutes in B&W. I watched it in 3D at home, but without color it might as well be just 2D. The movie itself is pretty good, but without color it lays flat. Everything sort of blends together. I would never own this unless they decide to \\"colorize\\" it, which would be pretty easy really. Mark my words, they will \\"colorize\\" it.
B002RI9ORI|5.0|Brilliant and often very funny. Highly recommended reading. Also check out Ben Goldacre on TED.......Youtube. One of my best reads for 2012

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'm very picky when it comes to Stephen King.  I've only read a few of his novels, and have probably quit in the middle of as many as I've actually finished.  11/22/63, however, is brilliant.  Brilliantly conceived, brilliantly written, brilliantly plotted, and (shocker!) brilliantly ended.  Endings have always seemed to be the bane of Stephen King, but this one closes out nicely.

B008518MOW|5.0|I  could  be wrong, but this film had the feel of the last in the series, though it was the best. The time travel portion and hints made for interesting watching. Josh Brolin did a good job playing a younger K and watching the 60's storyline was different. It did answer some things concerning the relationship and why's between J and K. I liked it and suggest it.
B003D513TQ|5.0|This film is beautifully produced and directed. It may not be spot on historically, but it is an amazing piece of &#34;eye candy&#34;. The costumes and set are beyond beautiful.  The story displays Victoria's passion for Albert and the politics of the era.

B0050DZ8J0|2.0|Clearly the design team for the Linkedin app consisted of Ray Charles and Jose Feliciano.. Why isn't the start page a menu of likedin features instead of the connections page? Why can't you see possible connections for third level contacts? I get emails asking me to upgrade to this premium or that premium but what for? If the basic app is cumbersome, how is the upgrade? Cumbersome on steroids? Come on LinkedIn, get back to simple. Add another menu layer, put in big buttons and put a main menu button on every screen. Or you can just lose users. Like me. Uninstalling now.....

B008FTAAG2|5.0|Normally into Metalcore / Post Hardcore, only bands with female singers I've cared for were Otep and Kittie.<br /><br />I got \\"Blood\\" and \\"Adrenalize\\" free, really liked both, then listened to \\"Whore\\" on Youtube and had to pull the trigger and buy the rest of the album for $5. Whole first half of the CD is amazing, Scarlet is really good, and Beast Within. Last 2 songs are decent but a little slower, but for $5 this CD's awesome bang for the buck.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Overall really great but some of the tilesets are almost impossible to see esp. the \\"Mayan\\" or whatever ancient American its supposed to be. I really like the Greek though. Its crazy how earning the awards really motivates me.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I'm on my second reading of this fantastic book. It's not the easiest read with the pirate jargon sometimes. It's just a wonderful tale that is more of a guy thing for sure.  Not to say anyone would not appreciate it. I hope both my daughters will read it when they are old enough. It's one of my favorites.
B001CISHU4|5.0|Everything about this album screams, &#34;we're vikings and we will murder you.&#34;  If you enjoy folk / melodic death metal, you will probably enjoy Amon Amarth, and this is probably their best album to start with.

B00846REIS|5.0|I love this book. By far better than Fifty Shades!  The love story was more intense and I like that Eva was just as messed up as Gideon! It should become a movie.  I am craving more.  Can't wait to read the rest of them.

0006486126|5.0|George RR Martin has to be one of the greatest fantasy writers of all-time and whose work, in my opinion, is as close to a modern-day version of JRR Tolkien. The depth that the author delves into is quite extraordinary with the extensive world-building and cleverly crafted, intricately detailed plot as something to admire. The tale that began in `Game of thrones' continues in book 4: A song of ice and fire, with the war still raging in the seven kingdoms and a deep-rooted conflict reaching its pinnacle. This absorbing, exciting read will have you hooked within the first few pages, loosing yourself within a mammoth tale of bittersweet revenge, heated rage and ambition. A master of epic fantasy George RR Martin has produced something so remarkably stunning, of such breathtaking scope, that you will be hard pressed to find something to equal `A song of ice and fire'.<br /><br />Crows will fight over a dead man's flesh,<br />And kill each other for his eyes.<br /><br />Bloodthirsty, treacherous and cunning, the Lannisters are in power on the Iron throne in the name of the boy-King Tommen. The war in the seven kingdoms has burned itself out, but in its bitter aftermath new conflicts spark to life. The Martells of Dorne and the Starks of Winterfell seek vengeance for their dead. Euron Crow's eye, as black as a pirate ever raised a sail, returns from the smoking ruins of Valyria to claim the Iron Isles. From the icy north, where others threaten the Wall, apprentice Maester Samwell Tarly brings a mysterious babe in arms to the Citadel.<br /><br />Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, victory will go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steel and the coldest hearts...<br /><br />This slab of a book (854 pages long + appendices) is certainly something to `stick your teeth into' and which will have you glued to the page for hours on end, days and months. As an avid reader of the fantasy genre this is a series that by far outshines many others with its atmospheric, starkly realistic picture that the author captures; purely graphic, bloodthirsty and gritty. Dramatic battle scenes that shake you to the core, heated divergence amidst rulers and great leaders and intense passion - this is an astonishing tale! Never have I been rendered speechless by an author whose accomplished writing ability, and astonishing creative visionary is truly noteworthy for this is a book that gives you Goosebumps.<br /><br />This is a book that had me lost within a trance for several months, with the hairs on the back of my arms standing on end and with chills running down my spine...just an epic masterpiece of sheer brilliance!!s with its atmospheric, starkly realistic picture that the author captures; purely graphic, bloodthirsty and gritty.

I truly loved how real the pain was  and yet how mature and strong she was at the same time. Not to mention Holders never ending love and support to her was so endearing. I truly loved every heart wrenching beautiful moment!

B00A8KJN14|4.0|There's a tendency to see Blu-ray as a boon to color films and it is. Babes in Toyland, as reported earlier, is true eye candy. However, when it comes to black-and-white film, Blu-ray accentuates the details and makes the clarity sharp as can be.<br /><br />Such is the case with the Blu-ray of Frankenweenie. As with so many Tim Burton movies, there are those who just can't get into his very specific vision and those who can't get enough of it. If the latter is you, Frankenweenie is, to quote Fawlty Towers, a \\"televisual feast.\\"<br /><br />My kids enjoyed it, particularly my son, but the family agreed that it was very intense viewing for young children. Please don't just plop this into the player and let the kids loose on it if they're very young and impressionable -- but you're the best judge of where your kids are in relation to movies and TV (we waited a loooong time before we showed Bambi to my son).<br /><br />Frankenweenie, in Burton style, is grotesque yet touching, strange yet perceptive. If you haven't seen the 1984 live action short that inspired it (included on the Blu-ray but not the DVD), it's the Burton world of a misfit in a suburban environment of eccentrics that screams \\"Who's the real crazy one?\\" This motif is especially strong in Frankenweenie, in which the neighborhood kids are much weirder than the odd central character.<br /><br />Things get pretty monstrous in the final climax, much like a vintage sci-fi matinee (only done with a great deal more time and budget). The animation is as amazing as ever. There is just nothing like stop-motion and its kinetic excitement. The massive work behind this kind of art is nicely shown in another Blu-ray only feature, \\"Miniatures in Motion.\\"<br /><br />DVD only viewers will also get a look at the traveling Frankenweenie exhibit that spent some time at Disney California Adventure Park. But the original short, \\"Captain Sparky vs the Flying Saucers\\" is also Blu-ray only. It's a charmer, very much a nod to Burton's Ed Wood and Plan Nine From Outer Space, as well as hundreds of amateur movies made by eager young filmmaking kids. Too bad it's so short, but then, so was a reel of 8mm film.<br /><br />The voice cast is uniformly superb, including Burton's Lugosi from Ed Wood -- Martin Landau -- and SCTV alums Catherine O'Hara and Martin Short (who turns in a lovely, restrained performance).'s Ed Wood and Plan Nine From Outer Space, as well as hundreds of amateur movies made by eager young filmmaking kids.

B0071XO8RA|3.0|Throughout most of five books which make up this omnibus edition I kept having the thoughts \\"is this a first draft\\" and \\"was this ever edited\\"? My suspicions were confirmed late in the fifth book when the author used the wrong character's name for one sentence. Each of the books contains several plot holes, inconsistencies, people acting out of character, and meandering plot lines that ultimately fill the pages but bring nothing to the story. The later books are especially guilty of this as each are significantly longer, however contain about the same amount of actual \\"story\\" as the previous chapters.<br /><br />At several points while reading this I had thoughts like \\"that makes no sense\\" or \\"that character would never do that\\". Without delving into spoilers, characters that are supposed to be smart, occasionally do incredibly stupid things, while ancillary characters do something that is completely outside their knowledge base and is essentially impossible given the situation they are in.<br /><br />The first book is actually the best of the five. It's short, but filled with a great scifi premise and a memorable well written character. It is marred by a large plot hole, which can be overlooked as the rest of that particular story is so well done. Later books contain numerous plot holes that take you completely out of the world and leave you questioning what the author was thinking.<br /><br />My biggest gripe with this book is that it has huge potential to be great. If each book was taken to a better editor or given a few more drafts the whole could have been the scifi classic that a five star review would entail. Instead of praising this author for self publishing, we should be pitying him as had it been taken to a publishing house each book could have been far better. The best scifi presents new ideas on humanity and lets the reader ponder his position on these ideas. At one point in this omnibus the significance of the title \\"Wool\\" and the silo is outright explained by a dialog between two characters. Worse yet, the characters talk not to each other but directly to the ideas the author wishes to explain. It's a painful section to read as a scifi fan or even just a literary fan.<br /><br />I debated giving this book 2 stars for being just a poorly written book, but an exceptional scifi premise and the fact that at times the book is a pleasure to read propel the star rating. No terrible, no good, it just exists.

This is what dragged me in the most. I really want to know what is going on with him.  Again I know this review is not all detailed and what some avid book reader wants, but there are a ton on here so.  This book is one of the best I have read.

B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Great movie. My three year old was fully engrossed in the movie even though she didn't understand all the concepts in the movie. Not many children's movies make me cry but this one did. Check it out.
140053271X|1.0|I wanted to buy an e-book and decided on a nook. Broke in 3 months. NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY. I tried to get support and the company refused to help me. Evidentally, there are screen problems with the Nooks. I did research and alot of other people had that same problem. Getting support for it is even worse. Don't bother with it. Go with a Kindle or a Sony.
B007XHWROK|5.0|My 5 year old daughter loves Justin Bieber.  She was beyond excited to get this CD as a gift.  It plays great.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Ever since Bejeweled 2 (B2) didn't have jewel blitzes, I got bored playing because there was no difference from the first Bejeweled. You didn't have the countdown bombs, or the boulders, or even the eight different modes... Nonexistent! It wasn't fun anymore!<br /><br />But then Jewels Star (JS) appeared in the app store, I felt drawn to it. JS has hyper cubes, ticking time bombs, blocks you can only destroy when you get more than 3+ gems in a row... I love the arcade mode best because once you complete a level, you can keep returning to it to get better scores. And the mineral rounds are exciting because it's timed, you need good strategies to get the gems from the top and strategically move them down to the bottom so that they take out the mineral cubes.<br /><br />Anyway, try it! & it's fun, free, and worth your time!
B003Y5H574|5.0|Me and my girlfriend have seen this movie like a thousand times now, its funny and great. The DVD cuality was amazing...<br />I strongly recommend this product..
B00000K19E|4.0|Obviously this movie is quite old at this point, so I have heard about it for years. I heard that the fight scenes and graphics were great, and though impressive when it came out, both are pretty outdated today. Though the storyline is magnificent don't expect a lot from the visuals of this movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was another great love story from Nicholas Sparks. I couldn't wait to get free time every night to read it. I have read just about all of his books and have never been disappointed.
B00005JN0T|4.0|I think this movie is great. I don't think most people enjoy this movie as much as I do, but I really enjoy the idea of robot takeover, and the ominous look of the emotionless robots is a little scary even after several viewings. A movie worth paying the price for.
0071752854|5.0|I'm glad I had a chance to stop by Amazon to review this book, but I only have 5 minutes before I have another meeting, so let's get going. (those that have read the book should find this first sentence comical)<br /><br />This book contains so much valuable information. I can't wait to practice some of the techniques that Oren Klaff seems to have mastered. Now that I have the playbook, it's going to be all about execution.<br /><br />I will now review The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing before I design any new products...and then I'll review Pitch Anything before I try to sell them.<br /><br />Thanks, Oren!
B004EPZ084|5.0|Exactly as advertised. Its an R rated movie and there's good reason for it, so if you are not an R rated kinda person - don't watch it. Works great . Prompt delivery, something I really appreciate when ordering online.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son loves this game, i would recomend it to anyone, great graphics and it works great. I like it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Would buy again and again....No wait time, and product was exactly what was shown.  OK so have a good day
B004N6369Y|3.0|It is a cute story compared to some of her books. I think my life story would make a 5 * book. I will still read all of her books though. Thank you.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|Great game for those who like a good game of suspense and great replay value for the multiple endings and good puzzles.
B0079J28NC|5.0|Great music of The Beatles Yellow Submarine, classic Beatles!  I've always loved the Beatles music, the words are so meaningful.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|Music that makes your imagination soar. Music that makes your imagination soar. Music that makes your imagination soar. Listen NOW.
B007IE4DSG|5.0|Love George Harrison Early Takes is so wonderful to listen to!  The talent of George comes through in his music.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love this series, Suzanne is an awesome author who keeps the pages turning with edge of seat action, then has you laughing out loud unexpectedly.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is a handy apparently to have, it sure makes it easier to get to my E-mail, and I am very satisfied that Amazon made it available at no cost, thank you
B001BGTWXI|5.0|I picked this one out on my own and he told me I made a great choice for him. It is easy listening and he enjoys all the music.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|This book was a fight to get through for most of the first half. The last 30% though, was an excellent read. A very good conclusion to this series.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Ok movie and I'd recommend it but I didn't think it was as good as the first 3.  I'm a fan of Jeremy Renner but Matt Damon was better.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|a good show for girls that is fun and shows a lot of character. Need more shows like this for young ladies.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I love this movie and it is a great movie to watch with friends and family and children and fun
B007M45PMU|5.0|To me, this album sounds like The Killers in The Decemberists' body, with a hint of Counting Crows added for good measure. I loved it from the first listen!
B002O3Z50Q|4.0|this is a great movie and I am glad to finally own this movie and blah blah blah blah blah
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great story!  It was very well-written with wonderful characters and a heart-wrenching plot.  I read constantly and always get excited when I find a storyline I haven't read before.  This was definitely new for me.  I read it straight through in one night.  Couldn't put it down!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Such a relaxing way of viewing Pinterest! I can use it just like on my laptop. This app is great!
034580404X|5.0|Kept me riveted to my seat in the first two books but slowed down in the third but it was a great series I will probably leave re-read!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm not a big fan of reading, but Nicholas Sparks had me hooked on this book from the very first chapter! It is an easy book to read and I finished it in a day,  I couldn't let myself put it down. This is a great story of the strength and courage a woman has to escape her abusive husband and home life and start over with a new beginning. All the questions that Sparks leaves within the story come together and answer themselves as the story comes to a close. Best book I've read in some time!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a very quick read finish it in half of a day, was definitely an intriguing read, the author is not ego centric as you might imagine, about half of the book is dedicated to his other exploits as a navy seal and the training he conducted to become one. Was very interesting to read this before seeing the movie 'Zero Dark Thirty' it really shows you how many inaccuracies there are in the movie.
B00A757EFW|3.0|would like the joystick to work as fast as the game goes. reminds me of being in an arcade. Thank You
B005LAII1C|5.0|I love this movie and I gave it 5 stars because I love the actors, the stupidity and how cute it was, pretty much. I'd recommend this to anyone of age that needs to just get a good laugh out.
B002Q1YDLI|1.0|I care more for Rachel than Darcy but it was good to hear from Darcy and Rachel and Dex but what about Marcus
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|If you're trying to change your life, and how you look at things, this is the book to do it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing, I watched the movie first then read the second and third books to the trilogy and the first is absolutely great. Even though I watched the movie countless times the book keeps me on edge. My only question to Suzanne is why did you only make the books to this series?
B0026772N8|4.0|This book is a tongue in cheek philosophy book, wrapped around a motorscycle trip, with a couple friends and his own son.They travel through winding two lane roads through USA heartland, flatlands, and ;then Rocky Mountains...all the while keeping his bike in tip top shape and thinking quietly about Homer and the Iliad.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Love  Baldacci.  Couldn't put it down.  Not a thing I didn' t like.  Looking forward to &#34;Zero Day&#34;.  Good for a rainy day.
B005LAIGLE|5.0|After seeing in theatre and watching on TV, decided I needed to 'have' it so I could watch whenever I wanted.  Great acting, great depiction on that world, realistic characters though you might not like the choices they make
0393343405|3.0|Stephen Greenblatt is a prominent Harvard professor and a Shakespeare scholar. His previous work, Will of the World, about William Shakespeare won the National Book Award. The premise of his new book is that the ancient Latin poem \\"De Rerum Natura\\" (\\"On the Nature of Things\\") by the Epicurian philosopher Tutus Lucretius Caro, caused the world to swerve in a new, more enlightened direction.<br /><br />This tale of a first century humanist is the winner of the Pulitzer prize and a strong seller on Amazon.<br /><br />There are chapters in this piece of nonfiction that I enjoyed more than I've enjoyed anything I've read in years. The book hunters who scoured the monasteries and religious institutions searching for ancient Greek and Roman texts is breathtaking. \\"On the Nature of Things\\" in one such work found in a German monastery. It was discovered by a Florentine book lover and personal secretary for the Pope named Poggio Braccionlini. One of Poggio's gifts was his beautiful handwriting that he used to transcribe books, but his more important talent was his love of ancient writing and passion for discovering and preserving them.<br /><br />It's unfortunate there were not more Poggios; ninety-nine percent of classical fiction and nonfiction has been lost. The way many of these ancient texts disappeared makes you want to weep; many times by plunderers with no sense of the value of books; religious fanatics who found the classics heretical; mobs of fools who burned libraries; or, one of the most persistent enemies of papyrus, bookworms.<br /><br />What I found most incredible about Lucretious's poem is that two thousand years ago he wrote that the world is made of swirling atoms in a void and nothing more. There is no heaven, hell or God, just these constantly moving particles. And he states that pleasure is the highest pursuit in life. That pain is the principle evil to be combated.<br /><br />Greenblatt gives little evidence that \\"De Rerum Natura\\" changed the world or significantly brought on the Renaissance or even caused a medium tilt in a new direction. The poem is fascinating, but it was not widely circulated or known.<br /><br />There is plenty of history and papal intrigue to keep you turning the page. At times it does bogs down in detail, but the story is important and well worth reading and preserving.ignificantly brought on the Renaissance or even caused a medium tilt in a new direction.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very riveting, Makes you want to jump out of your seat! Hope to see the Saga Continue!  A must Read!!!
B0000TAZBK|1.0|Took a few weeks for me to get this set in the mail.  I had already purchased and received all three of the soundtrack deluxe box sets from each movie score.  The music is incredible!  This particular set is crap!  The first and third CDs will not play at all.  The collectors cards are a joke.  They are not cards at all.  They are flimsy prints the size of the CD booklet.  Not much you can do with them at all.  Like other reviewers have stated, stay away from this set and either buy the soundtracks individually or invest in the deluxe box set versions if you can still find them.  They are a bit costly, but well worth the price!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Had to buy this book because of the ending of the first, Makes you want to read more!!! Leads you into book 3!
B009MO58G6|5.0|Was better than I had hoped.  Will most certainly buy more music form this artist.  One of the best of their time.  Still today cant get enough of their sound.  Very happy to have in my collection
B00A8SPNYW|2.0|Don't really understand how to get a better time in some levels where 3 seconds is the time to beat.  Either its impossible to beat the recommended time or I'm missing a key feature of the game.  Either way I tend not to play impossible games when I'm not able to figure out what I'm doing wrong.  Uninstalled after level 13.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|I have used the ColorMunki to calibrate my 23-inch HP desktop monitor and two laptops.  One of the laptops is dual boot, Windows and Linux, and I was able to copy the icc profile from Windows to Ubuntu with no trouble.  Calibration was easy and accurate.  This is a must-have for serious digital image processing.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|Bought this for my grandsons for Christmas & they didn't want to stop watching it.  Their parents loved it too. 3 years old & up it was a perfect gift.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|We saw this series years ago on PBS and were very happy to find it on DVD.  Yes, there is a lot of similarity between the episodes as far as the situations go, but for me the real joy is just watching Bertie and Jeeves and the interaction between those two characters.  And, it's given me a whole new (and just for fun) vocabulary to use with my wife, as I will occasionally throw in a \\"Very good, madam,\\" or \\"As you wish, madam,\\" and when I want to avoid giving an answer, \\"I could not say, madam.\\"!  Yes, I do think I could tolerate having a \\"personal gentleman's gentleman.\\"
B001EN71CW|5.0|This was a great movie, I only wish there was a sequel to it or more of the same kind of movie.
B004Y042N8|5.0|Love it!  Fun, challenging.  There are many levels to complete.  In the beginning, they are easy, but get MUCh harder
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I didn't expect the book to be as thought provoking as this, great ideas, great subjects, great book. WILL READ AGAIN.
B005LAIIQC|3.0|I am a big &#34;Bourne&#34; fan and was really looking forward to viewing the &#34;Bourne Legacy&#34; at home. In Blue-Ray the clarity of the picture is superb but the soundtrack is terrible. During a given scene the sound is so loud that it blasts you out of your seat and in the next scene you can barely hear the words. This is repeated throughout the movie-a big disappointment! The DVD version is better than the Blue-Ray version but in both the soundtrack is well below acceptable standards.
034580404X|5.0|I loved these books.  I purcahsed this set for my best friend. She is in need of some excitement in her life. Being in a gift box is so easy for wrapping.
B00846TTDG|5.0|I have the honor of being a member on a SWAT team.  I respect and consider special forces members as heroes of America.  The movie was a slight look into what these heroes do 24/7.  Everyone should see this movie.  Especially the ones that forget so easily how much freedom costs.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This has been a great series to read. Definitely worth reading.  Well written and great story.  This was worth buying on kindle fire.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I had almost all the characters, 75,653 coins, and a high score of 375981, and this stupid game restarted on me!!! Why? I don't know but now I'm PISSED!!! All my work thrown away!!! I rated it 3 stars because the game was still pretty fun before it restarted. GRRRRRRRR
B005HSG3VK|4.0|Very handy.  I chose purple  I like the stand effect when using mykindle.<br />I like the strap grip on he back.
B005RUV0NY|5.0|Love, love, looooooooove Walking Dead!!! Leaves me breathless every time I put on this show!!! Too bad my fave character didn't last too long :((
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Like I said, so far all good. But if it dims Ill have to update my review. Id say 93% of G5 games are great, lets see where this one leads us......
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is a very good game for people who don't get into big complicated games. Just difficult enough to be a challenge yet not frustrating.
1416972242|5.0|I have read the series and love it. I decided to buy them for a friend she is hooked after the first book. A must read for anyone
B001NN4162|5.0|I enjoyed watching the movie with my grandchildren which was given to them by their great grandfather.  It arrived timely and in excellent condition.
B004RLO0EA|5.0|This movie is awesome and the music is the bomb. I hope part 2 comes out soon. I love this cd.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|I love this movie but, the Amazon Instant Player does not love me. I had to restart it three times for the connection to be right and it still didn't work if you're trying watch it on your computer connected to a projector or TV.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My girlfriend introduced this game to me on her new iPad.  I was able to download onto my Kindle Fire and now I am hooked.<br />I feel it is good for my brain, especially as the levels begin to get harder to solve.
B00993FEUK|5.0|Ordered for grandson for christmas.He loves the movie and we got it on time.There were nor problems ordering and the price was right.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I enjoy playing this game now just as I did as a kid. The only dislike I have is that now I can't play it anymore unless I have WiFi. I think this problem should be fixed. This started happening after I completed the game.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I expected something kind of goofy and off the wall with a lot of futuristic blah, blah.  Instead, this movie actually has some serious issues presented with some thoughtful resolutions.  It was good.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is the most addictive game I would play all day long.  The graphics is excellent. I recommend this game to everyone who is in puzzle games.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely loved this book!!! you'll fall in love with the characters and cry with them. Thank you for the awesome read.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is so much fun and very addictive. I play this game all the time especially when I am bored.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|nice to keep in touch with friends and things going on in the world--would suggest trying it--be careful who you befriend
141690977X|5.0|I love this book i actually read my sisters first and decided to get one of my own so i can lend it to others :)
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|really enjoyed it....only one puzzle I had to skip...very good graphics..good story...overall worth the money..would advise buying it..long enough to really get into it..
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham's books are all excellent to good.  this one was a little different but he carried it out well.  The hero turned out to be somewhat of a scallion
B002WJI63A|5.0|I'm a big Mario Bros. fan and I must say over the years, this was the most prominent of the Mario series characters that I could not find easily available in a plush toy format. However, when I found this on Amazon for the price I paid for it, I was so excited! I ordered this on Christmas Day and it came to my door on New Year's Eve! Talk about excellent shipping! The Peach I got looks just like the picture, 8 inches tall, made of durable materials and well stitched. She fits in my collection perfectly. Thank you Japan VideoGames and Amazon!
0425263908|5.0|I appreciated this book because it got RIGHT INTO the juice and drama! Now, I can't wait to read about this live affair between two people with all sorts of emotional problems and barriers that are being broken as the days pass by!!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|What a pleasure it was to watch a program that didn't rely on foul language, murder and mayhem, and pornography to keep you entertained. Sound boring? Well, perhaps one has to have an appreciation for the British way of life in a more refined society in order to remind us that there is something out there higher and better than the gutter.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have MS OneNote and I like Evernote better.  This app is so easy to use and so well supported it is just the thing to wean one off paper notes you can never find when you need them!

B008A1B5Z0|5.0|After spending no more than 15 minutes configuring this, im already seeing a significant difference in performance! VERY HAPPY AND IM VERY PICKEY...
B001O2QW9G|4.0|Turtle is very detailed and looks realistic. Should be a little bigger, but I already knew what I was getting. Product is made in China and not Germany.
B001O9BB3G|5.0|I saw the movie and was interested to experince how the author unfolded the story in the written word. It lures the reader in to a small world that is full of deep human emotion that reminds us of what life is really all about. It is a book that I will read over and again to years to come.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I play Spider at work on breaks on my Kindle fire and other games that are fun and quick and at home.

B003O86FMW|4.0|Good book, can't wait to start the next one.  An easy read, but fun, with a couple of twists to keep me interested.
B004UID2LC|1.0|My 6 year old couldn't get this to work.  I haven't tried it yet and I don't use it.  I am giving it the score my 6 year old would.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|Picoult's books never fail to throw a curve ball in them.  This is just aother example.  One of the things I like most about her writing is that she writes in 1st person from each characters perspective which gives you a sense of what each character is feeling as the story unfolds.<br />This novel delivered a huge punch and made you think about both sides of controversy.  Over the years, I have come to love her books and I personally thought this was one of her best!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't have time for a lengthy review but I will say if I did it would be well worth my time just as the Wool series has been. The novels are wonderfully written and I dare say that Hugh Howey has been perfecting his craft more and more with each addition.<br /><br />Wool part 1 was short and sweet but it has a feeling of mystery and intrigue throughout with a foreboding conclusion that does a fantastic job of whetting the appetite for more. After Wool part 1 I knew I had a new author to keep an eye on. To put it simply when a new Wool comes out I drop whatever I am reading at the moment and dive in. As the saga continues to unfold you are able to bear witness to the conspiracy from multiple levels and perspectives. You are taken into the minds of pawns and puppet masters alike. It's a great ride and seven books in I still want more.<br /><br />This Wool 1-5 Ominibus is priced so low for the value that I would recommend anyone with even a tiny grain of interest should pick it up. If you don't like it you won't be set back too much. However, if you are anything like me you are going to love it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app has really aided me with my kindle. Had I not gotten this app, then I would not have been able to check my charge time or other such things.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It is pretty fun at first but kinda gets overwhelming the farther along you go. It repeats repeats repeats same things/rooms. Got bored with it.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I loved this book it kept my interest and there was something always around the corner. I read this book in just s couple days
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I always enjoyed his show and found his writing to be equally funny and enlightening. I will be reading some more from him
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great read, couldn't put it down and was kept in suspense till the very end with all the twist and turns. Would certainly recomment to a friend.
0689835604|5.0|This is my 16 month old's favorite book! It helps with learning body parts and fine motor skills to lift the flaps. I highly recommend it! We read it every night at bedtime.
B003QSIM30|5.0|This tale is a modern Disney classic now, it must be part of your collection. Definitely get the blu ray version.
1594203334|5.0|I swallowed this book in like a week, maybe even less time. It is a very fun read. I don't have any kids and don't want any (yet) but it does  make you hopeful that there is a different way! I loved this book and I am wondering if any of thsoe techniques with sleeping the night and feeding 4 times per day actually work?????  did someone try them?<br /><br />ON  the other hand......after I read this book, I ended up reading \\"40 reasons not to have kids\\" by Corinne Maier (she's French). Well, it appears not to be so rosy from an actual French woman's perspective!!!! Very very weird.....where is the truth? why such difference in opinions? Made me wonder this \\"bringing bebe\\" book after all but it was a fun read no less. I recommend it.
B004U8VWLE|1.0|Made a mistake by ordering the non HD version of this movie. Amazon you got to make it more plain which version is which when ordering on line!
076781214X|5.0|Great service.  Purchased this for my niece who LOVED this movie when it first came out.  She was very surprised and happy to receive it.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|If you've an impatient reader who flips to the end of books like I am, I encourage you to hang with this one. I didn't enjoy the long con of the  hero being confused and jerked around in the first part of the book but I was still curious enough to hang in there and in the end was rewarded with a resolution that was satisfying and not beyond the realm of possibility<br />in  the future. Good read.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|It allowed me to root my kindle fire 2! woohoo! Now I have the google play store. And now more annoying ads.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I'm not much on games but this has been fun. I'm winning more than I thought I would. Graphics are good and I have very little to say against the game. I read the reviews available before I purchased. Reviews have been very helpful in most of the items I've purchased off Amazon for Kindle.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I do keep my finger at the ready to mute the grotesque sounds and frequently close my eyes but the story line just ropes you in!  It's thought provoking ......what would we do as a society?
B006OB3K56|1.0|[BEWARE OF SPOILERS]<br /><br />Imagine a film which is a less energetic, yet similarly pointless, variation of American Psycho. That film is Shame, whose skin-deep what-you-see-is-what-you-get script would not have been so disappointing had any of the characters, but especially the two vaguely-traumatized main characters, been remotely interesting. Sadly they live in a world of upper-income banality dominated by glass and de-saturated colors, a world where every character is despicable in the only way that an economically un-imperiled and seemingly endlessly privileged character can be despicable, which is in the most boring way possible. They are not witty. They are not exuberant. They are just . . . dull, because more or less dissatisfied with their moneyed existence. Sound familiar?<br /><br />The screenwriters seem to have intended Brandon and Sissy (the sibling leads) to be an out clause in this respect by burdening Brandon with sex addiction and Sissy with co-dependence and then attempting to justify this behavior with an oblique reference to a past sexual trauma: \\"We're not bad people,\\" says Sissy, \\"we just come from a bad place.\\" And that's that. We never learn who abused them, or the exact nature of the abuse. Nor would this information be necessary were Brandon or Sissy charming or seductive or otherwise compelling. But they are none of these things: Brandon just . . . has sex. Lots of it. And he ignores Sissy. And Sissy clings to Brandon. Less-is-more must have been the idea behind Brandon and Sissy, but it undoes them quite. Less is less, in their case. They are not Iago or Hannibal Lecter, for whom opacity worked.<br /><br />This lack of transparency forces the viewer to make sense of their behavior through amateur guesswork. For example: Brandon, denied entry to a nightclub, is so desperate to get off that he resorts to a gay sex dungeon for this purpose. This makes little sense unless we're meant to suspect him of using promiscuity, which had hitherto involved only women, to cope with latent homosexuality. If we're meant to think that Brandon is so enslaved by his addiction that he would sink so low as a gay bar, then the screenwriters should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. And the brother/sister interactions are so bizarre--Sissy standing comfortably naked in front of an uncomfortable Brandon, Sissy constantly hugging/touching an uncomfortable Brandon, Sissy having sex with an uncomfortable Brandon's slimy boss in Brandon's bed, Sissy climbing into bed with a Brandon who is so uncomfortable that he screams at her to get out--that I had to wonder if the trauma from their past was a touch taboo.<br /><br />But all this speculation is only necessary because the film and its controversial sexual content is so very boring. At one point, Sissy and Brandon's slimy boss, a married man with children who makes it his business to hit on every woman he and Brandon encounter in a bar or restaurant, have this exchange:<br /><br />Him: [Holding Sissy's hand. The sleeve of her dress rolls back to reveal her wrist, which is apparently scarred.] What happened to your arm?<br />Her: Oh, when I was a kid I was bored.<br />Him: Well, you must've been really bored.<br />Her: I was.<br /><br />which sums up my attitude to this film.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|awesome book I cant wait until it come out in theaters next month:)It is a great book I suggest this book to anyone
B007EE4XKI|3.0|I've read over two hundred Star Trek books.  This on should be read since it is part of the relaunch, but it wasn't my favorite. I enjoyed the parts about Noonien. The scenes with the Enterprise crew just weren't as good as others since the relaunch.
B000V86OKG|3.0|Good Morning, this was what I wanted.  We only had 1 negative and not a big one.  The 2nd disc has some major pauses that cause it to skip.  The remaining discs were fine.
B0096PS4Y4|5.0|This is a review for the Rhino vinyl reissue of this brilliant album. Forever Changes is one of a few albums from the sixties that captures the spirit of the era still sounds vibrant and relevant today. The songs are all great and the music on this album is beautifully captured and enhanced by Paul A. Rothchild. Rhino has put together a very slick reissue using the original master tapes and has presented the album in all its original glory to the highest possible standard. The vinyl sounds very clean and is lovely to handle, there are no rough edges on the disk or other pressing issues. The vinyl is housed in a clear polymer jacket which is an extra touch that reminds that this is something special. Some people seem to have problems with Rhino vinyl but ignore them this is a very high quaility product in every respect. I also have the Rhino vinyl reissues of Unknown Pleasures - Joy Division (5 stars) and Electric Warrior  - T. Rex (4 stars) and these are also excellent/good releases but Forever Changes is the best Rhino reissue I have so far.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Although this book can be read on its own, it is part of a series which is worth reading in its entirety (Taleb's wisdom, insight, nd writing style improved from book to book but earlier ones are also great).
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is an addicting game. Only complaint is the slowness of points only so you'd purchase them. Other than that the games are mostly simple and easy puzzles however don't let that fool you this is addicting.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|Part 1 was great and Part 2 is even greater! Bought the HD version on Amazon Instant Video and it is superb! Love the convenience and quality of purchasing videos through the Amazon Instant Video Store. Now back to the movie. Story continues from the part 1 movie. Everything connects so you'll need to watch the first movie in order to fully understand the story behind it. Can't really say much other than you'll just have to watch it for yourself to see how great the story is told. Buy It!
B008NW67E0|5.0|I adore Mumford & Sons. If you enjoy their music and are a fan of Sigh No More, you will be enthralled by the songs you'll find in Babel. I truly consider this band to be a treasure among popular contemporary music. Their lyrics are poetic, their talent is undeniable, and everything about their work screams 'top quality.' You will not be disappointed by this CD. I don't understand the people who rated it down and can only imagine they're individuals who are impossible to please.<br />The CD includes some quieter songs (such as &#34;Reminder&#34; and &#34;Where are You Now&#34;), and some fast paced ones (&#34;Babel,&#34; &#34;Broken Crown,&#34; &#34;I Will Wait&#34;). They even have a wonderful cover of a classic (&#34;The Boxer&#34;). Some of their songs start out quieter and get increasingly fast-paced. It's an exciting CD to listen to, and I promise that if you are a Mumford & Sons fan, you will fall in love with this album.<br /><br />Side note: Buy the deluxe version! :) it has 3 bonus tracks (including &#34;Where Are You Now,&#34; which is a favorite of mine, and &#34;The Boxer&#34;).
B007IXWL2C|5.0|After finishing all 3 books,I am left wanting more,I hope there will be a continued series!!Can't wait to see what else there is to Mr Christian Grey
B002V0WN2K|5.0|WHo wouldnt love it!!!!<br />Love love absolutely loved it.<br />Worth every dollar spent on it.<br />Cannot wait for their tour :)
B004N8CP8K|5.0|I needed this for work and makes it so easy to connect up with. So easy to work with. Just follow the instructions.
B007G5O3K0|5.0|i absolutely adore this album. every song is good and i think the basic sound from a-ha must have originated from Morten Harket as you can hear their basic sound in a lot of the songs on this album. its so good to know that some people never change! i have been listening to him since i was about eleven and he is still my favorite. i love a-ha and i really enjoyed this album. he has managed to take the a-ha sound and bring it to modern day without losing sincerity and integrity. songs like \\"listening\\" and \\"quiet\\" i like better every time i hear them and \\"keep the sun away\\" and \\"just believe it\\" were instant favorites. definitely the best cd purchase i've made. so glad he is still going strong.
B00005S6K8|5.0|I love Harrison Ford as an actor, he always play in movie being the serious type in a ralationship, but in this movie it was first the other way around where his work was first important and then falling in love took control of his entire life.
1451627297|5.0|If you love the old Stephen King, you will love this book.  It masterfully interjects history into the story line.  The book is rather intimidating at first because it has so many pages, but I found that I couldn't wait to get back to reading it and finished it in no time.  It's one of those stories that you don't want to end!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|James Dashner is one of my favorite authors and the maze runner trilogy is one of the best book series I have ever read. In my eyes the hunger games could never compare to these books.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent book...I hope this book becomes a movie. I would reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys excitement and details.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I did not like the bad language,and to redundtant. It could have been a good story.<br />Iwould not read this author again.
B000KZBRG6|5.0|works beautifully, and its amazingly accurate, will use it as a secondary in case my 400$ one fails, great buy, will not disappoint you.
B0026SCMNM|5.0|I am not a literary critic.  I just like to read books.  I read this book during a particularly trying time, and it suited me because it was not a stressful, gritty read.  It is, as one of the reviews suggests, hauntingly beautiful.  You wander through a couple of years of Eilis's life and sort of watch over her shoulder as she becomes her own woman.  Its not flashy, but it is satisfying, especially for those of us with Irish ancestors.<br /><br />Its a quick read and a quiet success that I highly reccomend.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I fell in love with the characters and did not want to put it down.  The joys and heartbreaks seem so realistic.
B0091REZMW|3.0|too many popups.  does downloading full version cost money?  gets to be repetative but its fun ln small doses.  i play till energy is gone then i wait till its full then play again.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I used to love my Kindle app on my Motorola Triumph because it meant that I didn't have to bring my Kindle 3 with me all the time.  If I was waiting at the dentist office or somewhere similar, I could whip out my phone, fire up the Kindle app, and get some reading done.  Alas, I long for those \\"good old days\\".  The recent updates to this app are simply terrible.  It causes my phone to lock up and crash nearly everytime.  When it does load, it is sloooooooooooowwww[...]  Sadly, I am going to have to uninstall or revert to a previous version.
B001E45XT4|5.0|Love these things so much. I literally have nothing bad to say about them. Great fit, comfortable, nice program comes with them. 11/10
B003PIS5XI|5.0|This movie was fun in the 1980's and I rented it for my 10 yr old son since he liked War Games ( another 1980's movie). Entertaining for kids.  This is not a classic but if I remembered it from all those yrs ago, it obviously made some impression. Robert Preston always portrayed a good flim flam man. No nudity or bad language...I'm not normally a prude but I guess I am where the 10 yr old is concerned! LOL<br /><br />I also highly recommend War Games if your kids have not seen it.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|RIVETING PLOT. HARD TO PUT DOWN AND WHEN YOU DO YOU WONDER WHAT WILL BE NEXT SO STRONGLY YOU HAVE TO START READING AGAIN. I LIKE THE THIRD PERSON STORY TELLING FORMAT.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I just love watching this series especially on CD's that I order from Amazon so that I do not have to waste time watching commercials. My time for tv is limited but I can sit for hours that let me relax watching this great show between a write & NY Detective!
B004KV3PI4|5.0|This is a great album, not a weak song in the lot.  High energy, great playing and singing, great lyrics.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I started watching this series when it started but sadly due to medical challenges & the care of seniors with Alzheimer disease in my family that came first. Now I can sit & watch all of the episodes I missed. Enjoying every one and this is the best way not to watch commercials & waste time. The tie in between the Bureau and experts in what happened to victims is just GREAT. The love story evolving is not bad either &#60;g&#62;
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|This was well crafted by Rankin, and spared the old dog new tricks routine, Rebus is still the old dog with old tricks pissing everyone off while pursuing his own circuitous and reckless route(in this case over the length and near breadth of Scotland) to the politically unwanted truth. He picks at scabs until they not only bleed they weep and there is no band aid big enough to cover it up, and the cost is always greater for him, he diminishes himself just a little more each time, and each time you wonder when he will have nothing more to lose...or more importantly how long until his own pernicious bitterness will consume him completely and he not only bends the rules but breaks them and meets Cafferty's assessment that they really are not much different after all.
B003L77G8I|5.0|I had started watching this series when it was new but sadly multiple medical challenges & then hears of senior care caused me to stop watching it. Now that I have found it again I am loving sitting there & watching the interaction that goes on with all of the characters that are so well written about.
B001ANYDAO|3.0|It made some valid points and it is a decent book, however its nothing extraordinary. I'll probably finish it one day as I have it as an ebook, but like I said, nothing exceptional.
B000I5X81K|4.0|Nice voice and a good performer I could listen to this for hours. Recommended for any one that likes classic music.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|I lost several graphs because of this program.  It started okay but gradually I realized the problems for it.  It's fun to do work on the kindle but because of the program it takes several times longer it is more likely to be lost.  I recommend not buying this product.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is the best game ever. It is fun for all ages. Everybody will love it guarenteed. Hope you will.
0767020308|4.0|although we have got a few different Emma's. This one did have the same actors as another version that we have but it was different. A few different sences but it was great.  Just as good as the others if not better.
B00275EHJG|5.0|FUN FUN FUN....Not just for children!<br />If you are 5 -- this movie is Fun..... If you are 100 -- you will forget you are not 5!  ;-)
1419705849|5.0|This was on my granddaughter's Christmas list and she began to read it as soon as she unwrapped it.  We had to remind her that she had other gifts to unwrap.  My grandson was also excited to see another Wimpy Kid book was out because he also reads the series so I will be ordering a second book.
B003UESJH4|5.0|WONDERFUL!  What a Powerful and Touching True Life Story.<br /><br />Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush are Outstanding in their roles.<br /><br />Award Winning!
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|I love the Underworld movies. It is so great to find them here for a lot less than elsewhere! Thanks so much.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Takes you back to the days of big hair and big hair bands!  Even if you say you don't like musicals, don't pass on this gem if you even remotely like '80's rock!<br /><br />Tom Cruise will surprise you! He was born to play this role!!!!<br /><br />I will watch over and over again...... and it goes on and on and on and on.........<br /><br />Don't stop believing. In Rock Of Ages!!!!<br /><br />Can't wait to see it on stage !!!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This was a gift for a friend. He loves this set so much, that I haven't even been able to borrow it.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Between reruns and commercials, it is hard to enjoy the show.  These issues are no longer a problem, because I can enjoy my favorite nerds and geeks.
B005LAIISA|5.0|Now as far as I know, I have the complete Ice Age set! I can say that you complete my movies.
145210655X|5.0|This book is comical.  A must have for a Star Wars' fan.  I enjoyed so much, I bought one for my supervisor, who just had a boy.  He and his wife enjoy it also.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I love MIB movies. I love that fact that I could purchase this for less money than at other retailers.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This story is a well written balance of love,adventure and and suspense. It left me wanting to continue reading the story every waking moment. I couldn't put it down. I am anxious to read book two!.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|You can get any music video in the world and on the website! This is so cool to finally be able to watch music videos at a resturant!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|IF YOU ENJOYED IT ON T.V., YOU'LL LOVE IT ON DVD @ HOME!!<br />AND IF YOU MISSED AN EPISODE, YOU'LL HAVE THE WHOLE<br />SERIES TO PLAY OVER AND OVER WHENEVER YOU NEED AN<br />ENJOYABLE VISIT WITH CARSON (only, you'll have to make your<br />own tea, I'm afraid)!!
B0066WJLU6|1.0|So, I needed a flashlight right that second, and all I had was my kindle fire. I downloaded this app, and instead of shining through the screen, it said \\"NO CAMERA DETECTED.\\"
B009YQJ322|3.0|When I had finished viewing the movie, I didn't have that warm all over feeling. I thought the lead role was handled well, I just found it hard to wrap my head around the psychic and her role in this movie.
B006O3MU96|5.0|I totally see how this is fun, because it certainly is, BUT I would never pay for something like this.
B005G4TJUC|2.0|I have always had a problem understanding how anything which causes the degree of destruction as does the transformers can be of any merit for the planet. Then there is Shia, he makes me want to hurl every time I see him in these roles. The last thing I liked him in was HOLES.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Download all of any youtube videos! I can get music videos, funny clips, or even educational tutorials! This is great for all ages allowed on the site, because this is all of the website.
B008476HBM|5.0|Classic! If you haven't read it in a long time read it again and if you have never read it READ IT!
B00594XOZU|2.0|This app is not what I thought it would be. I tried sending my friend a text on it, and when I talked to her the next day, she said she didn't get it! And we checked her phone, and the number was all correct!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Wonderful book. Well worth the money and very worth the time. I recommended this book to several friends and my daughter. Reading this book was like peeking into my daughter's life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You play a fun game to unlock even better stuff! Unlock characters, coins, powerups, all that for free! This is my favorite game.
0547848412|5.0|Where did he get this idea??  Couldn't put it down and gave it to all I could.  Word choice and style is so talented.
B004I744AS|5.0|This app is great! It gives good information unlike some pathetic apps out there. It never crashes and it isn't slow or glitchy.
B006I1OB0U|5.0|If you are a Downton Abby fan, you must have this in your collection.  Beautifully filmed.  Gorgeous costumes.  On top of that, it sets up the 3rd season...
B001EC2IT4|4.0|This is a ghost story- but the ghosts are cool and the living people are Frighting.  The special effects are imaginitive and are amoung the best in any comic movie I have seen.  This film is well known(you probally have already seen it) and one of the most entertaining you will see.
B005PTQPU0|4.0|I love Kate Bush. And I LOVE this CD!!!  It's mellow and hauntingly  beautiful and I love the lyrics.  Before I bought this CD I read a couple of reviews about it.  Each reviewer said that it was a wonderful CD except for the song, \\"Snowed in at Wheeler Street\\" which she did with Elton John.  I like Elton John so I thought I would probably like the song regardless of what the reviewers said.  But I didn't. The reviewers were right.  It is the one flaw on this a beautiful CD.  Had it not been for that one song, I would have given this CD 5 stars.
B006VRDZ44|1.0|The sets were neat along with costumes. The show is way  too violent and the characters did not have depth.  I had heard it was a good show.mi just cannot get past the pilot.
B0093FNZT6|5.0|This is an excellant book for anyone who has experienced a recent death in the family. Highly recommend to anyone
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A great story of undying love, perseverance and justice told in a very unique and enjoyable way. A great and easy read.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A little bit of everything in a very realistic story. A bad situation for a young woman and how she escapes with the help of the unexpected.
B005NPCJ88|5.0|Great album!  Every song is great!  Well worth listening too! if u r a ffdp fan you will love it!
B007XHWROK|5.0|This cd really shows how much he has grown as an artist. Never bought any of the older baby kinda songs or cd but he brings it with this cd. Got to respect that. Good cd and price. Would recommend even if you maybe weren't always a fan of his music. Give this one a shot you might be surprised how he has matured. No more baby baby simple tracks. Songs with great beats and lyrics.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Harry Bosch doesn't mind confrontation with his bosses so long a he gets justice. This book was informative as there were things in this book I didn't know example that some of the murders in these riots still weren't cleared after twenty years.<br />Recommend this book to all Michael Connelly, Lee Child and David Baldacci readers
B005JLN9ZI|4.0|Cd was pretty good. I love drake. Wish there was a few more upbeat tracks but other than that it is great. Lyrics are good and well written and the music is high quality.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|She is wonderful.  You 'll  fall in love with her characters.  Brought me to tears.  Also read Hopeless....it's so surprising and emotional.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|A good cd to get if you have never purchased a cd of kelly clarkson and want all the hits. Great price and value.
B008AT9XOC|1.0|Terrible ending to a wonderful movie.  I expected the &#34;director's cut&#34; to be an alternate ending in addition to the movie, but it was bad - really bad ending.  I guess I don't know what a director's cut is..
B003D0ZNM4|5.0|Great for background music while doing paperwork ...heard parts of this CD on different radio stations had to have it.
B0035JNS2U|5.0|Have known it for a long time. Love dancing & have always danced from my Mother putting me in dance classes!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this alarm clock is a life saver.  I recently had an accident and had to take my pills at several different times of the day.  even firming the night this alarm went off to remind me.  it goes off while I am at the GROCERY;DOCTORS; etc.  It has not failed me once!  It is great for a timer as well.  I just set it for 20 minutes and you can hear it going off in the other end of the house.  They have recently made the buttons larger which is awesome!!  If you need an alarm or timer this is the one to get!!!!!  It is Awesome....I have a kindle that I use this app on and just remember  you have to keep it in &quot;sleep mode&quot; not turned off for it to work.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|Have this version in all sorts of ways. It is the best one even if there have been others. Great even with age.
B002ELIXCA|2.0|I DID NOT LIKE THE CONCEPT OF JUSTIFYING HIM BEING A SERIAL KILLER BECAUSE THEY ARE BAD GUYS.  GOOD OR BAD HE IS A SOCIOPATH.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Still as good as ever. It is addictive from years ago. Just good - doesn't take lots of words to tell you.
1595822003|5.0|The book was a Christmas gift for my daughter (in graduate school for art) and she absolutely loved it.  It came immediately and was in great shape.
B001N4RORE|5.0|This was adapted from the stage play & it is the best adaptation I have seen having seen the play.<br />Meryl Streep is, of course, one of the best actresses out there.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|The app restarts constantly,uses up unnecessary memory,slows/lags the phone making it freeze and choppy.Downloading songs to the phone is a pain...constantly have to uninstall app and reinstall to download music Ive bought. Its just a very bad app. Uninstalled it today and my phone works fine again...also uninstalled the Amazon Underground app-which is another horrible app as far as memory usage,restarting and lagging the phone. Im done with Amazon apps. Ill stick with Google music for my source of music.
0949551147|5.0|Asana Prnayama Mudra bandha provides detail clear instructions with explanation of beneifts and who should or should not do a particular asana.  It is well organized, authentic and accurate. I simply love it.  Great book for all levels.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I am a huge music geek and this movie was so much fun! I laughed so hard through the whole thing! Great cast! I bought the movie as soon as I finished watching it on Amazon! It was a must-own movie for me! If you like humor and music, this is sure to entertain you!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Solid game all around. It's fun to play when you have nothing better to do. Wish I I could play all day
B003HARV3Y|5.0|The family loved it. Good family time movie. On a level that's easy for the younger kids to understand. Glad we found it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I've always been a fan of dirty little romance novels but the Fifty Shades books have ruined those for me! I loved these books and look forward to seeing more from EL James, especially from that teaser at the end of book three!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is completely amazing!<br />I write this as I am crying happy tears over the astonishing power of love shown in this incredible book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time I would recommend it to any one it was great
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a fun yet addictive game! I love to grab the coins and jump over trains and roll under fence things! Best part it's freer! Got to get this game!
B005LAII1C|5.0|Mark Wahlburg is hilarious.  This is an instant classic and the package is very nice for this DVD.  A must have!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games was the best book I have ever read. Reading the book gave me a love for Suzanne Collins' work.I could see a mental picture of the events,and grow attachment to her characters,especially Peeta Mellark.And to feel feel the sadness in my heart,with the characters,I loved it.5 is underrated,this book needs a 100.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|This is a wonderful movie and the extended cut enhances the original twice over.  The packaging for this movie is the nicest one I have ever purchased.
B0037A4ILC|5.0|This is one of the better films I have seen in the past few years.  The script is wonderul and the acting first rate.  And the cinematography is amazing -- you will feel like you are facing the hazards of climbing a mountain using only circa 1935 technology.  This is no hollywood story, although the production values are first rate, so be prepared for a real story to enjoy and be moved by.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I've been having loads of fun with this game, mini games and trailers keep my little one entertained while I build the little town. I've played for hours strait. Great graphics and no lag on my phone.
B00005TQKQ|5.0|This one little tape saved my bacon from having to buy a replacement camera.  It worked great and I am in the process of transferring my old family tapes onto DVD's.  I guess sometimes these tapes work and sometimes they don't, but in my case it worked.  The tape was delivered as advertised and on time.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this game is great! they graphics are amazing. the story line really kept you thinking. can't wait for the sequel.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|This is an excellent movie, but sometimes hard to follow because of the fast pace.  We saw it at the theater first and decided that there were too many details that were hard to keep tract of, so decided to have our own copy.  We have watched it several times and have used the playback as well as slow motion to get all the details.  It is a bit brutal and sexual in places, but relates to the story.  I would not let younger children watch the movie for those reasons.  I purchased a used-nearly new DVD and it was in great condition even the box.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|This is a wonderful movie, well acted and with a great uplifting story. My son was a stutterer so had special meaning for me.
0553593544|5.0|So great. And nothing at all whatsoever like the movies. I wonder why they even have the same titles. Strange.
0345803485|5.0|I actually bought this as a gift.  The person that recieved it loved it.  I've heard great things abou this book
B008578PRK|3.0|Spooky stuff.  I love stories about vengeful ghosts, and this one is a doozy.  It seems a bit slow in places, however, and though I'm a fan of Daniel Radcliffe, he does seem too young for the part.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|I am glad I purchased this movie, it wasn't what I was expecting.  It could have a better story line, but it was good
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I love my cousin dearly so when she said she was reading this and recommended it, and wanted to discuss it with me, I paid ten bucks to download it.  There's some money I'll never get back.<br /><br />What a gooey piece of romance-novel crap, peddled as genuine fantasy.  Save your money and download an old harlequin novel.  Bleah.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love these books! I recommend  these books to anyone whose interested in a rebellious thriller. I simply couldn't put the book down
B009VB7QQA|4.0|I really liked this movie, as I really like the book upon which it is based.  It bombed at the box office but I can't see why.  Well acted and with some really tense and scary scenes, especially the one where his mother is killed.  Lincoln's mother offically died of &#34;milk sickness,&#34; which sounds so mysterious to us today that substituting &#34;vampirism&#34; isn't that far off. A different take on vampires in America, which was very refreshing, because I don't like &#34;nice&#34; vampires and these aren't.  These vampires are on the side of the Confederacy, and are using slaves as nourishment. Big battle at the end, also nicely done.
1419705849|5.0|I personally have not read these books, but my little brother loves every one in this series, and he was thrilled to get this for Christmas. I've read bits and pieces of some of the books, and they're hilarious. I'm glad he found a series of books that entertains him and keeps him reading. Not many books do that for young boys anymore.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is fun and it is Free, Free, Free,Free, Free, Free, Free, Free, Free,Free, Free, Free, Free, Free, Free, Free.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing. I couldn't put it down for a second. After every single chapter, I got more interested in the book. I recommend this book for middle schoolers and up.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|I love the songs, characters, and plot in this movie.  While some historical aspects are not true, this is a children's movie and I thought Disney went about setting it up quite well.  The artwork in this movie is amazing as well.  It's a movie that I could watch over and over, and I am certainly saving this one for when I have children.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Call of Atlantis (Premium) Love this game. Have the PC version and was excited when it was available for my Kindle.
B000CNE092|3.0|I got this DVD thinking that it would be amazing.  Sadly, I was a bit disappointed.  While the art in the movie was absolutely stunning, I thought there were some parts of the story that were a bit odd.  For one, I thought it was strange that she could not remember any of her past, as if that happened to a child in real life it is likely that they would experience traumatic nightmares until adulthood.  Also, I did not care for the evil bat.
B0091LS07E|5.0|This CD arrived in the time it was supposed too.  Was in very good condition.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves Alicia Keys' music or if you just want some beautiful listening music!
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|I ordered this movie, and it came within two days of my order, with regular free shipping.  The movie itself is wonderful- one that can be watched over and over, with family, friends, or by oneself.  If anyone hasn't seen this movie, I recommend them doing so.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|While the movie captures the overall essence of the novel, the book goes so much deeper into the emotionally charged mental state of the main character, Pat, who suffered a mental breakdown because of his wife's infidelity. The author portrays Pat's emotional state with incredible clarity. The silver lining is Pat's core belief in his own happy ending through his fantasy belief that he will eventually get his wife back. This belief sustains him as he transitions from fantasy to reality. A wonderful novel, engaging, funny and heartbreaking with a happy, silver lining ending.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I was looking for a great deal on the complete series, and I ordered this when the product was nearly $100 off.  The shipping was fast, however, the Tudors cover slip and the Tudors show box was slightly dented and was peeling at some places.  But I didn't order it for the box, I ordered it for the wonderful show.  While the show certainly isn't 100% historically accurate, there's a great plot and wonderful acting.<br />If anyone is looking for a great deal, I would recommend this.  However, if they are looking for a nice collection to show off, I would recommend checking out at different stores to assure that their box is not messed up in any way.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|DVD arrived in great shape, and it's a hilariously stupid movie.  Right up my alley :)  Ok for kids too.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I love this movie so much.  After I watched it with my little cousin, I was certain to order it.  This movies is extremely heartfelt and teaches the true meaning of love and family.  It was one of the first movies that I've ever teared up in.  My family and I watched it, and we all loved it.  It's entertaining for all ages, and the little minions are sure to make anyone laugh.
B000000WCA|5.0|What can I say?  I'm old school and LOVE Sporty!!  Got this album to enjoy with my 10 year old daughter.  It's been a hoot :)
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Beauty and the Beast could very well be my favorite Disney movie- tied with Tangled.  I watched it as a little child, but would often become too scared to see parts of it.  As a teenager today, I must say I love this movie.  I appreciate that Disney gave time for Belle and the Beast to bond, as it bothered me that many of the Disney princesses would fall in love right from the start, even without knowing anything about the prince.  This movie is heartfelt, and very touching and wonderful for almost any age.  I think some little children might find some scenes (the wolves, for instance) a tad bit frightening (as I know I used to).  I am certainly saving this DVD for my children.  The songs are wonderful and the art in the movies are absolutely stunning.  I've watched this movie a hundred times, and I always find something new that interests me.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I  Loved this book ... I found it touching and refreshingly real. I would recommend this book to a friend.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I have a macbook pro with boot camp and i run both windows and os x. It works fine in both, but the software only runs on windows. You can not program the buttons on os x and the buttons programmed in windows don't perform the same functions in os x. However, it is still a great mouse and it comes highly recommended. 5 stars.
0765325950|5.0|My favorite series of all time and I think Brandon Sanderson did a wonderful job finishing up this difficult legacy. I am sad the journey is over, but it was a trip well worth having taken.<br /><br />I am really disappointed in the 1-star reviews based on the lack of an e-book. I suppose I should also be mad because the hard cover copy came out before the mass market paperback edition? For all the other books in this series, I was patient enough to wait for the mass market edition.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This is a counterfit case!!!  The vendor doesn't bother to tell you that and it's a piece of junk.  Fell apart within 1 week!!!
B003VANOFY|5.0|My son bought this headset first, then his friend wants one too, and asked me to buy for him. He is very satisfied whith it.
B0058YPL66|4.0|Bought for a Christmas gift and they liked this very much.  Now they are anxious for season two to buy.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|All you out there that are out there wondering if you should get this game take it from me this is my son's favorite game on his kindle fire we always have to ask for him to get off the game and turn it off and bed.don't listen to all the other people!they're crazy
B002ZG999U|4.0|I saw at the movies and brought it.  I rate the show I see as waste of time, a renter, or need to buy and watch again at home.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|I can not reccomend this more. I had heard so much about it and was not disapointed. Now even the wife is hooked!
B007XC9BSK|3.0|My 5 year-old wanted this for his Squinkies after seeing it in an ad but was slightly disappointed because the launcher does not work at all. Apart from that it was a win! Not especially sturdy but how sturdy must it be to transport itty bitty rubber vehicles?
B009KY5OGC|5.0|Another good read for any one interested in the history of the American Indian and the ruthless government strategies of getting what they wanted for the white man,no matter what the cost or who got in the way.  Mainly the Indians. they were cheated out of their lands by the lying of government agents & the military.  They were accused of murdering & raiding the white man's cattle & homestead, while they were deprived of food & clothing promised them by the government.  The agents assigned to them were crooked & ruthless.  I can sympathized with them.  Look what is happening in this country today.  But the Bible says, \\"God is not mocked, he sees & does not forget what one man does to another out of greed.\\"
B003UYV08E|5.0|Movie is beast mode from the start to finish. Hot chicks, fast cars, and ass kicking. It's great! I highly recommend this film.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|(Okay, you'll have to forgive the terrible pun in my title!)<br /><br />Welcome to the land of magic, the realm of gods and demons and mystical creatures, and say hello to some really powerful kids!<br /><br />The Kane siblings, Carter and Sadie, are used to being less than normal.  Their mom died years ago.  Their mom's parents fought to make Sadie live with them, while Carter traveled the world with his professor-ish father and lived out of a suitcase.  They only saw each other two times a year!<br /><br />This all changes when, on a scheduled visit with Sadie, the world gets flipped upside down -- their dad rushes them to a museum, blows up the Rosetta Stone, releases five Egyptian gods, and then is locked in a golden sarcophagus and stolen away in front of them.  Carter and Sadie are thrust into a new world -- where magic reigns supreme, where animals are more than they seem, and where the power of the pharaohs and the gods rushes through their veins.<br /><br />Discovering that Set, Egyptian god of darkness, chaos, and all that is evil, has been released and has taken their father -- and more importantly is planning to destroy their world, Carter and Sadie embark on a world-crossing adventure through a modern day world filled with ancient Egyptian magics.<br /><br />This is a fun, exciting romp through mythology (which I love, especially Egyptian and Greek/Roman!).  While it's a \\"YA\\" (young adult) story, it's pretty fun for anyone who likes a little magic and fantasy and silliness in their stories.<br /><br />Looking forward to reading the Percy Jackson series (about the Greek gods) and the other two books in this Egyptian/Kane trilogy.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I bought this after I had watched one night of it on TV and wanted more.  It was an HBO freebie, wanting us to sign up (but we didn't).  So I purchased the DVD instead.  After watching it, I could not wait another year until Season 2, so I began to read the book that were in the series.  I am now on the last book that has been released so far and can't wait until another one is released.  Meanwhile, the 2nd series will be out soon on DVD on 2/19/13 - and I will definitely be purchasing that one as well!  Loved the DVD, the books and loved it on HBO!  It takes place in Medievel times and the places and characters are ficticious but the story is Great, Great, Great!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Having seen Phantom of the Opera live several times with Crawford, Guillaume, etc. I was very impressed with this movie adaptation. It's hard to capture the power of the state and the music in a movie but I really felt like this is a close second to seeing the Broadway performance. The angst and confusion of Cristine is very well played out. I don't think this story ever gets old. BTW- personal opinion, Raul is her life love and though the Phantom is a dream he isn't someone she can love in reality. Love the ending and the way this was shot! Good work.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|I purchased this for my husband to increase his 3D library and for the reviews of it that I read on-line.  It lived up to it's reputation.  The 3D was really great and I would recommend it to anyone looking for great 3D.  Movie itself was also good!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I always had to wait to play minecraft when I had to go places but now I can play it on the go.
B001684L0A|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband and we loved it.  I love history so maybe I loved it a little bit more.  I learned so much from this series.  It really makes you think of how things were back in that time and how patriotic and determined these men were.  Great for children learning about this period in their history class.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Love love loved it!!! Couldn't stop watching. I'm addicted for sure. Will be a loyal watcher from now on. Amazing
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I had bought this as a Christmas present for my husband, but he was about to go out and buy it - so I gave it to him a little early!  We both enjoyed it very much.  Really, really good!
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is a great game. The only thing I don't like is the ads that constantly pop up. Thank you.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|One of the best Best puzzle adventurous hidden object games I've played in a while. Not too difficult to find the hidden objects combined with puzzle s that are challenging.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I got this game for my little girl, but she didn't like it. So I tried it and now I am hooked!!!
B0064T6LV8|5.0|Exactly what I expected it to me :)<br />I keep trying to make it past level 5 I get so close!
B00006690G|5.0|Older CD by Em, but I feel like it IS one of his best! If you're a TRUE Eminem fan, you already know what this CD has on it, If you don't own it and ARE a fan.....BUY IT!!!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is so much fun, I am so addicted to this game. I think it is better than minecraft.
B001RLP862|5.0|They were great for my games. I often play games with friends such as poker and also do magic tricks for a few children I know. These cards were really great and felt really smooth. Unless you don't like that plastic feel or prefer paper this is a great idea for any average person
B004VYYA2K|5.0|My daughters were asking for a doll house for Xmas. The ones that I saw were way over priced and since this would be their first doll house, I decided on this one. They LOVED it! I love the storage in it. It was very creative.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Awesome book liked the whole series sad ending and surprising too the beginning was confusing but it explained it self later.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I thought that this was a really good movie, and I think that everybody that like's action and adventure should at least preview this movie.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This is the perfect case for my Kindle Fire.  I didn't want a bulky case, but I wanted something to protect.  This case is comfortable, light-weight and exactly what I was looking for.
0783225547|4.0|This was a great movie and I bought it to be able to watch it whenever I want.I really loved this movie.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This is one of those books that you read, and then can't help but recommend it to all your friends, and anyone else who makes the mistake of bringing up running to you. Mcdougall tells a great story, winding several narratives together in a way that feels congruent while reading. The book is also very very very very motivating in the sense that you will want to peel yourself away from the book just long enough to go take a little run, before delving back into its pages. I'd highly recommend for runners especially, but honestly I think it would be thoroughly enjoyed by most people, runner or not.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Terrible movie, do not waste your time and money on this!  Terrible movie, do not waste your time and money on this!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Very different from the Original. I enjoyed watching it. It kept me waiting for the ending the entire time. Rent it!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|at first the book was hard to get into, but as I continued to read, it got more interesting.<br /><br />I am looking forward to seeing the movie now that I have finished the book
B005LAIIGC|5.0|When I first saw the  previews for this movie I knew that I would like to see it. I went with my godson and his mom. My godson has ADHD so it is very difficult for him to sit still for long periods of time UNLESS something or someone has his rapt attention.This movie had him sitting not only still in his seat,but at the edge of it thru out the entire movie. I love Hugh Jackman in any way shape or form so him as the Easter bunny was perfect.Every Character's voice was perfectly cast except my favorite Sandy, who never speaks  except in blurbs above his head or gestures What a great character! The Baby teeth were adorable and the movie will not disappoint and will help keep the holiday magic alive for any age even us big kids!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|A quick and easy access to time available for browsing, reading, listening to music, and so on, measures battery capacity- lets you know how long it will take to charge. Cool to look at as the color of the app can be changed. Other reviewers have brought up negatives with regard to this app but I've noticed none of the same after months of usage.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|husbAND ALWAYS CHECKS HOW is drive is going to be coming and going. rain, snow, wind and everything in between
B005EHQGTS|5.0|THIS app solved a MAJOR problem for me!  I guess I wanted my cake, and wanted to eat it too.  I wanted all of the functions of a laptop in a very compact 10.1 inch package, but I also wanted all the fun of a tablet.  I nearly returned my tablet because it was more fun than functional with using all of the mobile apps that were not Word, PowerPoint, etc.  Splashtop solved this problem, and I can't be more thrilled!  I'm getting my actual desktop, and working it like I would at home in every way - except on my tablet.  The only shortcomings I guess come with the territory:  You have to leave your computer on and set it to not sleep or hibernate.  Also, when Splashtop is connected, your screen will not turn off either.  Both a small price to pay, I guess!  Thank you for an awesome product!  (By the way - when are we getting Splashtop 2 HD?)
B0086700CM|4.0|great graphics and a lot of fun and boy can you run. my teenagers love it and got me hooked
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Great game fantastic graphics can't stop playing it. So worth the money many times over! A must have for puzzle gamers.
B007N8RULO|4.0|This is a good app, but would be better if it would size itself to the screen in landscape mode.
B005KELW26|5.0|beautiful case, easy to install your kindle fire, nice feel, looks like real leather, would buy again.. Love the color!
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Haven't seen this movie yet, but it arrived quickly and we are anticipating a great time from all the positive reviews. Great buy!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|WOW!  This was a wonderful book.  When I finished it, I wanted to immediately read it again!  Many twists and turns which make all books fun!
B007VUA7VO|3.0|I was finding my KF only charging to 95% using the \\"device\\" info that comes preloaded on the Kindle. I thought that this app would give me a more accurate picture of the charge state. I find that it matches exactly the device info from the Kindle so I guess that info is accurate anyway. I really don't use the Kindle for much more than an occasional surf, reading books and playing a couple of games - don't know if I really need all this app has to offer but it has nice graphics and does give a lot of info.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I bought this set as a gift for my sister who wanted all the Harry Potter movies. It doesn't have anything fancy or a lot of extra stuff, but I doubt you could find all the movies anywhere else for this price. So glad Amazon had what I was looking for at a reasonable price!
B003L0V758|5.0|I will be buying more of Janelle Monae's CDs.  I love her style.  It's different from the usual music you hear on the radio.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I have to  say this is a very good app. I liked it even more since I was able to get this for free.
030758836X|1.0|Now that anyone can have a blog and a public identity and share their message with the world, what would yours be?  I gravitate towards people who send a message of love and compassion.  Gillian Flynn, in Gone Girl, does just the opposite.  Gone Girl is filled with foul language, hatred, fear, shallow characters, and derogatory material towards both women and men.  While all of these elements can be used to great effect in literature, skilled writers generally use them as a counterpoint to some other message, or to accurately portray a character or time period.  In the case of Gone Girl, these elements are the message.  There are no likable characters in this book.  There is no redemption.<br /><br />Gone Girl is the story of Amy and Nick Dunne.  When Amy disappears on their fifth wedding anniversary, all evidence points to Nick as the murderer. Through multiple plot twists and shifts in narrative point of view Flynn keeps the reader guessing what happened.  As tempted as I was to give up on this book, I was also intrigued by Flynn's manipulation of the plot.  I was curious to see if the book (and characters) could redeem themselves in the end.  I needn't have bothered, and neither should you.  The ending was worse than all the rest of the book put together.<br /><br />If you are still on the fence about reading Gone Girl, then know that Ms. Flynn spent much of her writing career as a journalist for Entertainment Weekly.  This may explain why the characters act like spoiled rich people who are completely out of touch with what it is that makes us human. Don't waste your time on Gone Girl - there are thousands of excellent books out there that will teach you something about the real world, books that will test the limits of your compassion and stretch your brain with new ideas.
0307387178|4.0|This is a true story of a young man who wanted to live his own way and on his own terms and unfortunately didn't live to tell about it. This is a cautionary tale for someone considering living as he did with no preparation, provisions, knowledge or common sense.
0316223239|4.0|Does the idea of reading a novel about a young woman and her five year old son who have been imprisoned in an 11x11 room for seven years turn you off?  Me too.  However, Emma Donoghue, in her 2010 novel Room, crafts a story that is wondrous, meditative, and transformative.  Instead focusing on the mental anguish of the victims, Donoghue writes a quiet, focused story of a child and his mother.  Donoghue's decision to use the voice of five-year-old Jack as her narrator gives the book an urgency and sense of wonder from the first paragraph.<br /><br />Jack believes that his world, the world of Room, is all there is.  Inanimate objects like Wardrobe (where Jack sleeps when `Old Nick' comes to `visit' his mother), Chair, Table, Rug, and Skylight are the things that `people' Jack's life.  Although Jack is exposed to the broader world through the small television set in Room, his mother intentionally leads him to think that there is nothing `Outside' of Room. Donoghue doesn't dwell on how Jack and his mother come to be in Room, she focuses instead on what Jack is seeing and feeling and thinking, especially as his world changes dramatically.<br /><br />Inspired by several instances in the news where children were born and raised in similar captivity, Donoghue became intrigued with the idea of what exposure to the real world might seem like to a five-year-old who had never seen the `outside'.  In an interview shortly after Room was shortlisted for the 2010 Man Booker Prize, Donoghue acknowledges studying her own children's speech and language patterns in order to create a language that would be realistic for a five year old, but not a barrier to a reader.  The voice of the narrator is unsettling, to be sure, but it serves the story well, and immerses the reader into the viewpoint of the narrator.  The author's faithfulness to Jack's point of view is what makes this small story so riveting.<br /><br />Room is a short novel, and can be read in just a few days.  It has a simpleplot with few twists, no cliffhangers, and no flashbacks, which seems odd to the modern reader.  Room has two main characters, Jack and Ma, and, stripped of all other literary embellishments, it is the powerful relationship between those two characters that carries the story for all of its 321 pages.  Because it is so minimal, this novel truly does become a sort of meditation.  Instead of sitting cross legged on a cushion with closed eyes, however, the reader is holding a book, and what happens in that book takes on the same tight, closed feeling that Jack's life has - this book becomes a whole world.  Through Jack, we enter that world completely, and his experience changes the reader as much as it does him.
0307887960|5.0|I've only been doing the diet for two weeks and have lost 14 pounds.  I have gone directly by what the book says so I would highly recommend it.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I bought this CD because I appreciate someone putting together different genres of music that I am not normally exposed to.  This CD has some great love songs as well as moody alternative music songs.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Inspiring and really solidifies my belief in. A beautiful hereafter! Now if I could only convince my surviving children.  We lost a son 7yrs. Ago@41 and I feel such. A connection to him even though he expressed his doubt that there was a hereafter after having been raised Catholic. Anonymous
B009FB3XTA|5.0|So glad these CD's came out.  I hate the music on the radio most days and don't have time to listen to my I-pod too often.  So, these collections of off the beaten path artists have been a God-send for my ears.  Gives me hope in the next generation of musicians.
B002E0JL4A|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Don't know if how true the real character is to Robin Williams, but he's a little out there, but a great heart for the poor which is great. Although our country doesn't have to worry about having no healthcare for low income families...they'll never be turned away b/c taxpayers are paying for it now, nonetheless, this is a fantastic movie that shows how to care and love our neighbor as ourselves!
B004XZR63M|4.0|good read. Recommend for those working the 9-5 and looking for guidance on how to expand income streams and capitalize on creating an S corp.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|thought this movie was super cute. Not too kiddy but still interesting for what it was. Picture quality was great!
B003E8P9G0|4.0|I think That this was a very good book. I think That the author did a very good job of explaining what would happen if Egyptian magic entered the real world.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I love the twists and turns this book takes. It is always surprising to see what happens next. Keeps you turning the page for more.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It's one of the best books I have read in a while!  I highly recommend it!
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|when my son set this up i was amazed. very convenient to access home computer desktop. Home pc or laptop must be on & you need to be connected to the net on both. Still great for editing doc or even forwarding something to yourself.
B0092QITO2|4.0|Good movie! The scenes were very well done...story was ok. I really enjoyed this and will watch it again! Even better than original.
B0038P59A0|4.0|great movie. bought cord to connect to tv and it plays great. I didn't get the HD version. it would probably be even bett
B004JN1CW4|5.0|one of he best books ive ever read so i hope the sequel comes soon. everybody should read this amazing book
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Great relaunch of a classic old tv show.  I would recommend this show to all Dr. Who or science fiction fans.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I liked every single track on this cd!  Had to listen to it twice right away, as I was hooked on Adele's voice and music.
0062086529|5.0|This book was a childhood favorite of mine, and I'm so happy the publisher made a board book version so my young daughter can enjoy it also.
B000002KCV|5.0|This CD is just wonderful. I listen to it often and never grow tired of it. It really takes me back in time to the 70's.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I thought uglies was a great book. It had a great adventure and it was exciting. I'd say uglies is  is a kind of scy-fy type of book. It is my new favorite book. :) I hope I was helpful
B002N7CTKM|5.0|Just watch it. You won't regret it.  Great characters, great writing, and great situational absurdity.  I don't get why NBC is trying to sabotage this show.
B0085YNML2|3.0|I originally downloaded this game for my son. He loves it because the little lizard is cute and his tongue shoots out. But he's only 3 years old so it was too challenging for him to advance very far in the game :-) Sometimes he got lucky and made it through certain rounds. So then I picked it up to give it a try. It's a fun enough game, definitely challenging and will keep your interest for awhile at best. I don't play it very often at all lately, it's just not one of those 'I can't wait to play' games. It's simply a okay game. Give it a try, you be the judge.
1118156315|5.0|Clear, simple and precise.  It can change the way we have been thinking in a powerful and positive way.  Very useful!
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I love Bubble Touch, it's addicting. I find myself playing it late at night before bed to unwind occasionally. I've had the game for about 4 months and I still play it here and there. If you like these bubble type shooter games, then this game is for you. Arcade mode is my favorite. Enjoy it!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I read this book in just over a weekend while travellling.  Loved the way it was written with the use of letters to talk about the story.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen in my life!  A must see for all!  I was shocked to find out that this all started out because of the deregulation President Clinton signed into law as well as the deregulation in the communications/entertainment industry that he signed into law.  Yes a democrat folks!  The banks own both republicans and democrats!  The banks truly are the real puppet masters running the US of A...  When he signed that, it was truly the beginning of the end.  We seriously need to bring back those regulations in order to get our country back on the right track.
B0038NN3B4|4.0|It is colorful and has excellent healthy recipes.  I would like some lists of acceptable foods on phase one.  I think that would make it much easier for a beginner.  More phase one recipes would also help because if you fail at that stage you never get to the next ones.
B0091LS07E|4.0|I am an Alicia fan.  Thought maybe her new album would be a hit but there are only a few songs I like but I am still glad I purchased the CD. :-)
B002JVWQSW|5.0|On my wife's Christmas list.  Bought it from Amazon, no brainer there.  Wifey loves it so much, that she watches the episodes alone, then makes me watch them with her as she narrates (hooray).  She thinks it's the funniest show ever.  I just think she's funny as a narrator.  But it was a home run gift off her list, so I'm happy.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|This movie has some super cool special effects going on!  I could watch it over and over.  Even after having seen it several times I still find myself gripping the edge of my seat during certain nail-biting scenes.  If you like disaster movies, watch this one!
B005OZE9SA|4.0|I got this for my adult son for Xmas recently & it was on his top Xmas wish list....he's happy with it as far as I know!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I received the DVD in the amount of time specified, but unfortunately it sat for several weeks because of the holidays. When I was finally able to sit down and watch It, it was definitely worth the wait! I don't think I'll ever tire of Harry Potter...could watch them over and over. Great series!
B0079R8KO0|4.0|Bought the grandkids Kindle Fires for Christmas, and pictured them flying to the floor from the top bunk.  So it seemed a case was in order.  This one is nice, doubles as a stand, and the kids are keeping the devices in them all the time, so I guess they fit the bill!
B002SJIO4A|5.0|I hadn't seen this anywhere to rent, so just decided to buy it so my husband could see it (I saw this movie with a friend at the theater). I have yet to open it with all the holiday goings on, but we will watch it! I give this 5 stars because I think it's a great science fiction movie and the ending is amazing and tugs at the heart. Worth the watch!
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I love any Scarpetta story...but this one seemed like it was drawn out just to fill some pages and took too long to get to the point about Marino..... all in all a good read
160059672X|5.0|This is a gorgeously illustrated book that goes into advanced details as to how to create the elaborate designs that are pictured on the pages. I thumbed through it and I found it both interesting and informative. However, I should have read the title more carefully, because it is literally about embroidery (duh)! I do not have much patience for embroidery, beads or no beads, so I do not think that I will actually be using this book. I was looking for more of a detailed explanation of how to do beadwork without the embroidery, and I am not sure if I will find much that will be useful to my aims in these pages.  You never know, though, I might find some details I like.  Oh well, it is still a beautiful book.

B00AFROVQC|5.0|Great book!! the story starts with a character that was neglected from his family and meets the royal sorcerer that tell him, he has a great purpose in the future and meets a girl that came from a book.<br />Highly recommended for anyone who likes fantasy/romance type of books.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|Even though we are apparently Never, ever getting back together, it's all right, because my doesn't know it yet girlfriend sings some cool songs. I just don't ever want to tick her off or she'll write a song about me!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I use it every time I use my Kindle. I like seeing the progress. I didn't need to buy the  full app but why not support them for the work they did. I got the free version first and liked it.  jh

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very moving! It was very difficult to put down. I finished in about 4 days, reading every chance I got.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was such an easy read... I began it and was on chapter 23 before I knew it.  Warm fuzzies and happy endings...good stuff!

B001A5HBJC|5.0|As both my father and stepfather were in the advertising business during this time period, much of this is familiar to me.  The Volkswagon ads were discussed ALOT at home, as were their ad agency Doyle-Dane-Bernbach.<br /><br />This show reminds us that the 1950's-1960's were not the \\"good old days\\".  Thank God we have gotten more enlightened regarding equality of race and sex and there are more opportunities for both.  I don't remember my mother and her friends being as vacuous as the women here, however, so applaud them.<br /><br />It's a delight to see how uncannily the era is replicated in attitudes and atmosphere.  The production values, camera shots, lighting and staging are brilliant.  And the actors don't overplay their roles; the timing is impeccable.  Each show is addictive--you can't wait to see what is going to transpire next as the mystery of their lives and relationships starts to reveal itself.<br /><br />I love watching this on the treadmill as the show is so captivating, time passes quickly.  Can't wait to introduce the series to my offspring--show them what it was life when their mother was growing up.  They won't believe it.  It's the 1960's equivalent to DOWNTON ABBEY.
B008CJ0KEM|5.0|Got it on time I think the processing is a little slow though but we love the series.No problems with the disc.
B000UOGHKS|4.0|The title track with its bongo drums and funky sound makes its very catchy and entricing.<br /><br />Madonna' version of the famous 50s song is hypnotic and Disco-funky flare makes it sudtle.<br /><br />'Bye Bye Baby' is a smemi-comical and has the feel of a 50s break-up song.<br /><br />'Deeper and Deeper' is a lively Dance song with keyboard, piano, guitar, and violin fused in, while Madge speaks about her life as a child.<br /><br />'Where Life Begins' is VERY metaphoric and has a R&B flare.<br /><br />'Bad Girl' is relaxing, beautiful, and a melodramatic ballad.<br /><br />'Waiting' is a deep track avout one longing for the one that turns them on and hoping that they still want them ('Did You Do it' is a parallel to it and continues 'Waiting' as a smaple).<br /><br />'Theif of Hearts' is about an unpleasant lady who no guy should go near.<br /><br />'Words' is about a relationship that's about to end, while being sung with thew Club music playing.<br /><br />'Rain' is about Madge mother and is a very touching song on the album.<br />'Why's it so Hard' is about trying to end conflict and make peace win out.<br />'In This Life' is another touching song on the album and is the most underrated.<br /><br />'Secret Garden' like 'Where Life Begins' is VERY  metaphoric and catchy.<br /><br />NOT every single track on the album is about sex and also is good for Clubbing and is the album that REALLY showed that Madge was bold to making a statement on something.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|...and profound.  No wonder this little treasure of a book made the 100 best books ever written list.  A must read.
B00008S2VG|4.0|'American Life' and 'Hollywood' talk about how not everything that made America what it is, is all that it semms.<br /><br />'I'm so Stupid' speaks of one realization that what they desired, turned out to be-as you guessed it-stupid in actuality.<br /><br />'Love Profusion' expresses how it's important to have love in this World and to not ever lose it.<br /><br />'Nobody Knows Me' talks about how you shouldn't listen to the corrupted people in this World and live your life or focus on improving it.<br /><br />'Nothing Fails' is a lovely acoustic guitar song about finding love in your life.<br /><br />'Die Another Day' is a great hommage song to the British spy and summarizes his character perfectly.<br /><br />'Intervention' sends a great message about why it's important to have love for those in your life and beyond.<br /><br />'X-Static Process' explains one confessing their love and need of help from Jesus. Than finding their answer.<br /><br />'Mother and Father' is about Madge' relationship with her parents, her love of Jesus, an her longing for love.<br /><br />'Easy Ride' is about one wanting nothing but happiness and peace.<br /><br />Some of the songs are Folk and have some of the some Techno that was from her preivous smash album 'Music' from the help of Mirwais Ahmadzaï.<br /><br />Not to mention a controversial album which shows Madge being as she always been-blod.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Awesome book! A real page turner. Nicholas sparks has a way of telling a story.<br />Highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story.
B00756GKBA|4.0|'Give Me All Your Luvin' relfects on Madonna' likes and dislikes in a potential lover, obviously.<br /><br />'Some Girls' speaks of the various types of girls that exist in our World-good and bad.<br /><br />'Gang Bang' and `'I Don't Give A' relates to life after a failed marriage-litterally.<br /><br />'Girl Gone Wild' and 'I'm a Sinner' xpresses on repenting of their sins, but still love doing them.<br /><br />'I'm Addicted' and 'Super Star' expresses one's love of someone to that of a famous person.<br /><br />'Turn Up the Radio' is a good song for those who love to listening to the radio to ease the stress in their lives and help them to relax.<br /><br />'Love Spent' relfects what has happened in a relationship and why it has gone so sour.<br /><br />'Matserpiece' compares an amazing person in your life to that of an amazing work of art or monarch.<br /><br />'Falling Free' talks of when one is free and how happy they are about finally having freedom.<br /><br />Some of the songs on the album are about a sinner turn servant was the theme of the tour.<br /><br />Plus also relfect on Madge' life and what she sees and is told by her older children (namely Lourdes who does background vocals on 'Super Star').<br /><br />Overall, the MDNA album isn't that bad and shows that Madge still is here to stay.
6305428425|4.0|Ive always loved this movie and I was definitely happy with the product :) There were no scratches on the disc and the packaging held together really good while shipping.
B00005J6T1|4.0|Nearly all the songs on Madonna' self-titled debut album were written by her (with the expection of 'Holiday', 'Boderline', and 'Physical Attraction').<br /><br />'Lucky Star', 'Boderline', and 'Holiday' were the smash hits that made Madonna get the attention of the public.<br /><br />'Burning Up' is a great electric guitar song on the album (though its music video-being Madge's debut-didn't do as well as the song).<br /><br />'Everybody' is a fun Dance song full of euphoria.<br /><br />'Think of Me' is a catchy Dance song with the spirit of 'Burning Up', 'Borderline', and a dot of 'Holiday'.<br /><br />'I Know It' is a melodramatic song with percussion thoughout.<br /><br />'Physical Attraction' is a sexy song with the spirit of 'Lucky Star'.<br /><br />Almost all the songs sound alike but are great for dancing and singing along to.<br /><br />All the songs on the album are wonderfully done and just was a sample of what was yet to come from this gal from Micthigan who would NOT be a one-hit wonder.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have found this to be fun and entertaining. My whole family is now addicted to these fun games on this great app.
0394400267|5.0|The author dues a superb job of converting dry historical fact into a very readable and enjoyable look at life in the 14th century in this work of \\"faction\\".  It certainly sets straight the relationship between peasants and ruling classes using \\"composite\\" characters based on real people of the time.  Her writing style makes it an easy read, an informative read and a book I will keep on my shelves forever.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Nice game!!! Haven't had any issues with freezing while playing! I would recommend this game to anyone who likes The Sims!
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Beautifully packaged set, full of Indiana goodness. The packaging is about the size of a typical Blu Ray package and therefore sits perfectly with other Blu Rays without taking up much more room. It looks almost like a book, and once you remove it from the sturdy, decorative protective cardboard sleeve, you can see the amount of detail and thought that went into the package. Each &#34;page&#34; of the book showcases key drawn depictions of each movie, as well as a miniature picture of the theatrical poster and various pictures taken during the making of the movies. Within each page is an opening where rests a rather snug Blu Ray. My main complaint is that the discs themselves can be rather difficult to remove from the openings so that you don't damage or scratch them. Aside from that one flaw, the set itself is wonderful. Watching these movies again on Blu Ray was spectacular, and makes you fall in love with Indy all over again.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|What a great book. I couldn't stop reading.  It was so funny and awesome I recommend this to anyone honest
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I always like Nicholas Sparks books. This one was very interesting and kept you from not wanting to put it down.
0307346617|4.0|I wanted to read this book in anticipation of the movie coming out this summer. It wasn't what I expected, which is to say I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I was intrigued by the variety of character perspectives, though I would've liked to get more of the story of the journalist collecting the narratives (other than the brief introduction). It's a clever conceit and it holds up well, though by 3/4 of the way through the book I was hoping for something new. The histories are primarily from the point of view of men, mostly mercenaries and soldiers (as you would expect in an oral history of a war) and they begin to feel repetitive as different weapons and strategies are discussed. Emotions and personalities come across in some narratives better than others and the representation of humanity extends across countries, cultures and classes. The postwar \\"peacetime\\" setting makes it easy to compare to other eras in history, so the reader is jolted again and again by the descriptions of the enemy-- the undead who do not need food, water or air, who will not ever surrender and have no purpose but to destroy humanity. It's a chilling undercurrent throughout the book, one that demonstrates the author's deft ability to mesh the realities of war with the fiction of zombies. This is the stuff of nightmares and \\"What if?\\" conversations-- and entertaining (and creepy) read.
0425241505|5.0|Pia Giovanni has done the stupidest thing possible, steal from a dragon. Now she is on the run for her life. Dragos Cuelebre is a dragon that has been around since the dawn of time. He is rather upset with the thief but when he catches her he is challenged by her. He realizes that he has been bored for a very long time and there is something about Pia that interests him and makes him want her.<br /><br />But hunting Pia down starts a war with the Dark Elves and Cuelebre finds himself trying to figure out what Pia really is along with trying to kill the Dark Elves king. Pia has feeling for Cuelebre but is also battling the teachings of her mother, which has been run and hide.<br /><br />I really liked this book. I was instantly drawn to Pia. Cuelebre does get overbearing with the whole commanding streak, but he does take a look at how others react around him. I cannot wait to read the next book in this series and see what happens next. This is one paranormal romance that you simply must read.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I liked the new approach yet keeping key characters in play in this movie.<br />Frankly the car and motorcycle chase scense got tedious and I felt I had seen them before but the rest of the film was interesting and well acted.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Love the minoins, Drew and the girls are so true to kids that age.  I think I like this movie as much as my 2 year old, who request it when she gets to pick the movie.
B00A7CF1QY|3.0|I liked this movie, it has some good action and suspenseful movies.  If you like action films of this gere, you will probably enjoy this one.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Don't like the direction that author Flynn has Mitch Rapp headed-- too profane and sadistic. Same for his boss, Irene Kennedy.
B0084B1T8Y|4.0|This is a wonderfully imaginative story, everyone should read the story as opposed to watching the film.  THe characters are rich and you can really get lost in this world of make believe.
B001BKVWYG|2.0|Like most people here, I imagine, I bought Cold Fact after seeing \\"Searching for Sugar Man\\", a documentary about a Detroit singer-songwriter called Rodriguez who made two well-reviewed albums in the early 1970s and then vanished after they flopped. Unknown to him, though, the albums became enormously popular in South Africa where (if you believe the documentary) their iconoclastic undertones helped undermine the apartheid regime.<br /><br />So I bought the CD and listened to it several times and thought \\"Huh?\\" I really, really wanted to like this work but there is very little to it. First off, it's short, with just 12 tracks and most of them under three minutes. Secondly, I see little to back up the assertion that Rodriguez was a genius on the same plane as Bob Dylan. It's no doubt unfair to judge music made 40 years ago and yet saying that, most of these songs are quickly forgettable. The one with the most modern-day relevance is the entertaining \\"This Is Not A Song, It's An Outburst: Or, The Establishment Blues\\". That said, I can't understand how it could have been billed as a crucial work in the fight against apartheid. It's too slight. The same goes for \\"I wonder\\". I've listened to the rest about six or seven times each and couldn't hum you a line from any of them.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The first part of the book about his childhood and search for religious truth moves along very slowly.  I wish suggest that you just skip over it, but it does set the stage for the remainder of the book.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised that the film followed the plot of the book very closely. There were a few deviations, to be sure, but overall -- a beautiful rendering of what I had only seen in my mind's eye until now.<br /><br />Yes. It is January 2013 and I am just now reading the Harry Potter books, and have never before seen the films, either. I don't want to see the film of a given book until I've finished the book. I'm reading &#34;Chamber of Secrets&#34; at the moment.<br /><br />The entire cast is extraordinary, and do a wonderful job. The kids (OK, fine, they aren't kids anymore, today) that played, well, the kids in the film, did such a good job it's a little scary.<br /><br />Yes, I highly recommend this... as if my recommendation actually counts at this late date :)
B004JHY8A8|2.0|I didn't finish this book. Too heavy<br />I had read a couple of books about World War 2 and jews being gassed and didn't want to read another.

B004G600A4|5.0|My whole family really enjoys this movie.  We ordered it for Christmas, and it was a great treat on the holiday!
B009ANP48G|3.0|I like this movie a lot, but my issue was this Blu-ray + 3D Blu-Ray+ Digital Copy. I have a blu-ray player and in this middle of this movie the sound and picture would go to crap. It really irritated me. I returned this product once and got a new one hoping that was the issue, but it wasn't. Very displeased with that.
B00003CXAA|1.0|Although the set came sealed in celehane, the disks do not function as they should.  The picture goes in out and when you can see the picture it fades from bright to dull and at times becomes distorted.  They are of no use to me.  I have ordered  another set from Ebay.  They were advertised as like new and obviiously they must have had a manufacturing problem.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I love Pitch Perfect, an ultimate chick flick. The ending is the best part. From time to time, I will skip to the ending and just watch that.

B005LAIIPS|5.0|This movie is awesome and well done and the price was worth it. I have watched it 5 times already.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Sorry I spent the money. I think I fell asleep.  Every other word is swear word. Plot very boring. Don't waste your time.
B008TTPQXA|4.0|A very interesting read especially given the occupation of the author.  To quote the old adage &#34; for those who do not believe in God no explanation is possible and for those who believe in God no explanation is necessary&#34;.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|This is a great game and a lot of fun. My only complaint is that even with my phone plugged in it drains my battery. Samsung Galaxy S Epic 4G
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Very disappointing read especially after all the hype. Just another boring and repetitive soft porn story that might just interest any kids between 12 and 18 years old.
B0018OAPAW|4.0|I have liked the Offspring for years and Lord pray, this is just another addition to the ever wonderful views and laughter I experience.
B005FITIDC|5.0|Great man movie, very inspirational, would recommend for any man, especially men with strong sense of justice. May be a little too violent for most ladies' taste. I didn't like the excessive profanity, but that's to be expected with this type of movie.
B0073SPDHM|5.0|There's nothing like having Ben & Jerry's ice cream whenever the craving hits.  While they do provide recipes for many of their most popular ice creams, they don't give away all their secrets.  The book starts with an interesting background on how their ice creams came to be developed, how their working partnership developed, and some of their business philosophy.  It also has recipes for frozen yogurts, coconut cream, frozen fruit juice desserts, and a few of the specialties they prepare in their store.  If you enjoy their ice creams you will most likely also enjoy this book.
1612183956|3.0|Possible Spoiler<br /><br />Although I enjoyed \\"Pines\\" the story is very reminiscent of the classic TV miniseries \\"The Prisoner\\".  The ending however has a nice wrapped up conclusion and it was a breath of fresh air to not have some ambiguous ending that simply asked more questions.<br /><br />On another note,  I actually picked this up due to the comparison other's have made to \\"Twin Peaks\\".  Being a huge fan of the show I can definitely say those comparisons are completely incorrect! Besides the fact that the main character is a government agent and it takes place in a small, secluded town, the similarities stop after that.  Maybe these comparisons were made just because of the \\"feel\\" of the book or because not everything is what it seems, or because \\"Wayward Pines\\" has a similar tone to \\"Twin Peaks\\".  I dunno, but it's definitely nothing like \\"Twin Peaks\\".<br /><br />All in all I still found myself intrigued through the entire book though and some moments even in a heightened state of suspense, wondering what the next page was going to bring.  If I had not seen similar films, shows and read similar stories I probably would have rated it 4 out 5 however since this was simply a good story and brought nothing new to me, I give it 3 out of 5.<br /><br />PS - I recently read that M. Knight Shyamalan is in talks with Fox about turning this into a TV series.  Shyamalan hasn't made a good film since \\"Unbreakable\\" (in my opinion of course) and every TV show seems to get cancelled before the first full season even airs.  If it does happen I might consider watching to see how true it stays to the book, although I could see this as more of an hour and a half feature length film than a TV series.  Just my thoughts.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|This was the first Cornwell book I've read - and thorougly enjoyed it.... love the main character and the mixture of history (even if &#34;opined&#34; in many cases) action, and humor.  Cannot wait to get into the next in the series - though I wish I had started with the first - which I will now go back to for a read.  Kindled an interest in early England - maybe at some point I'll understand just who it was that came from there or settled there or conquered there - the book makes you want to check things out on Wik or other.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this my favorite game since I downloaded it and it is way better than temple run. so if your wondering to get this app or not well get it
B000F8O35U|1.0|I sent this movie to my 2 1/2 year old niece.  When my sister took the video out of the package (it was (re)shrink-wrapped), it was scuffed and scratched.  She was already thinking, \\"This is New condition\\".  We all could have lived with that, but the movie stalls in playback.  Try explaining that to a toddler. What's worse is that I contacted the company twice and didn't get any response at all.  Amazon's A-Z Claim has resolved the issue, but should that have been necessary?  If you are going to advertise a product, at least back it up with a response when you are contacted.
1481207474|4.0|At First Sight: Minerva Lane has spent the last 12 years hiding everything she once was and living under the name Wilhelmina Pursling, a shy wallflower, almost-spinster who lives with her Great Aunts. She doesn't want her past to come out to the light, so she carefully blends into the background and deflects all and any attention that comes her way.<br /><br />That is until she happens to met Robert Blaisdell, the Duke of Clermont while they were both hiding behind some curtains at a gathering; and for the first time in years, someone sees Minnie for all the things she is, and not just what she appears to be.<br /><br />Robert didn't expect to be mesmerized by Miss Pursling, but he is, she makes him smile, she makes him think and she challenges him, without caring that he's a duke - most men wouldn't like this, but Robert isn't most men.<br /><br />He was born to great privilege, but had a rather lonely childhood, constantly being used as a bargaining chip in the war between his parents. His relationship with his mother is cold on good days and non-existent on the bad ones, and he has made it his life's work Not To Be Like His Father, who hurt so many people, including the mother of his (half)brother Oliver.<br /><br />Robert is on a quest to right the evil deeds his father committed, but his path might put the people close to him in danger, including Minnie.<br /><br />Second Glance: The Duchess War is the first full book of the Brothers Sinister series - there was an introductory novel called The Governess Affair which was awesome - and I was very excited to read it, and I'm happy to say that, over all, the book didn't disappoint.<br /><br />Robert is such a darling character, he has such a strong moral center and takes his responsibilities to other people very seriously, and tries to be fair in all things. He's no a rake, he's a little embarrassed of his own power as a Duke, but he's not afraid to use his rank and station to protect the people he cares about like his cousin Sebastian, his brother Oliver and their friend Violet. And Minnie too.<br /><br />Minnie, now she was a little harder to like, she has a lot of fears and has been hiding her true self for a long time, and sometimes that manifests itself in ways that aren't all that attractive, but once you learn what happened to her it makes sense. She still freaks out too much for my taste, and the big reveal of her past was a little underplayed, but it makes sense for her situation.<br /><br />I loved her relationship with her best friend Lydia, I think that's where it's shown how a like she  and Robert are: they are both fierce about the people they care about, but they actually expect very little from them in a way that they are a lot harder on themselves than what they are on everyone else.<br /><br />Still for me, Robert was the star of the book, he was the one I liked best and whom I felt for the most.<br /><br />Bottom Line: The Duchess Wars was a very good read. It wasn't perfect - there were some things I didn't like - but I LOVED the hero so much and I'm so excited to see where this series goes - the next book is about Oliver and it's called The Heiress Effect.his cousin Sebastian, his brother Oliver and their friend Violet.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|I love these books. Impatiently awaiting book six, so rereading the first five to pass the time. One of my favorite series!
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I avoided this movie for a couple of years -- I didn't believe they could recapture Kirk and Spock in a prequel.  They most certainly did -- very recognizable universe, lots of authentic action.
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|Great character development.  Good story line.  Had some good scares. Not predictable and worth watching more than once. Would recommend to all vampire movie fans and horror movie fans in general.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|This was a good guess as to how the day might have gone; I'm glad we didn't work out this way!
B00AYB0SX4|2.0|Not much of a story line.  Really quite boring.  I was expecting more and was quite disappointed.  It wasn't really even interesting.
0780626494|5.0|Brendan Fraser is genius in this role -- he plays an innocent, inexperienced young man, with style.  Very funny flick!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The games are still in full swing during this sequel but the book ends abruptly and leaves the story hanging. Guess you need to read the following book in the series to get an ending and some closure.
B003UESJF6|5.0|Good drawing, great dialogue.  I saw this once on TV and had to have it -- still love it a lot.
014241493X|5.0|Good book for a reasonable price, I would recommend to anyone with young kids to get this book, it will keep them off the TV
6304806418|5.0|What can I say -- I believe Madonna gives us her best work ever in this movie.  The music is captivating, and Antonio Banderes shines as Che.
0425263908|2.0|I bought this book and the second one at the same time because of all the 5 star reviews. I felt like I was reading a bad version of 50 Shades. It did not get interesting until more than half way through the second book. The writing style took me a bit to wrap around my head because it felt like the scene was not happening as I read it in some cases. It was like past tense or something. I don't know how to explain it exactly. I loved the 50 Shades trilogy and have read it 5 times. I was hoping this book would be the same thrill for me, but it was not. The only reason I give this 2 stars is because I did actually get into the plot before the second book ended and I am ashamed to say that I will most likely buy the third book just to see what happens to Gideon and Eva. I think this book was rushed to get it out to people since the 50 Shades fanatics where eager for more steamy romance, but in my opinion the author should have taken more time to build the story and not tried to copy 50 Shades so much.
B002XTXG1G|1.0|Very good art has occasionally been made with violent sociopaths and petty criminals as its source material (the Sopranos, to name a recent example).  Not here.  This is tedious, plodding.  Tom Hardy over-acts in a way that would make a high school drama student cringe.  The fight scenes are about as realistic as the ones in a John Wayne movie.  Most of the five-star reviews seem to come from wanna-be tough guys who, I'm guessing, are missing the massive current of homo-eroticism that runs through the film (Charlie, for an alleged bad-ass, sure has a lot of gay/transvestite friends and, in one scene, a naked Charlie forces a prison librarian to rub him down with lotion and, while he's doing Charlie's rear end, Charlie yells 'faster faster, faster'.).  Then again, as that parenthetical remark demonstrates, the current is pretty hard to miss so maybe the reviewers are just into that, consciously or not.
0385360185|5.0|I bought the 3 audio cd series and listened to them every morning while getting ready for work.  I hope miss EL James makes a continuing book relating to this one!
B008LZHA3G|4.0|Pretty typical Dylan and supplements the only other Dylan CD I have.  Not the greatest of albums but is a good addition.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|LOVE the show, loved the first two seasons and this season 3 looks like it lives up to the other two seasons......
B000ZJTPLG|5.0|Love this little baby! Great for practice without disturbing the peace. Amazing tone in a small package. Will be purchasing some of their other models.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Keeps time better than my car's clock.  Looks great.  Helps to give it a few shakes before taking it off in the evening so it doesn't stop while rolling the date between 2-5am.
B0016NF06O|5.0|If you enjoy the blue like I do your gonna love this.Willie and Wilson are wonderful togather ,I listen to this quit often
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I really like the music feature And the easy use. But I wish. The alarm had a feature that enabled it to gradually get louder. Otherwise it is perfect and doesn't drain the battery
B005K17RU0|3.0|It works just fine but the weather.com app is superior. Sorry AccuWeather! Otherwise it is easy to use and updates fast
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a great book! You know it's great when it runs you through the gamut of emotions. Not all books feel real, but this one does.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This app is necessary to open certain documents and files. It is a no brainer to get this free app for your device.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Starts off easy, and becomes challenging the higher you reach in levels. My boys love it! Highly reccommend to anyone!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I've used many weather apps over the years and this is by far the best. To be honest, I haven't learned all you can do with it yet. It is a spectacular looking app as well.
076781326X|5.0|Definitely support the arts in schools! The music teacher has exposed the kids to things that they would never have the opportunity to see. Peaks their interest and inspires them to continue in the arts!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|in is a great story. Lots of Fun images. Good fun. I enjoyed the  games walk through. Story and short games. Well done!
B000F8O35U|4.0|I bought this for my daughter for christmas. The movie and its case are in great condition. The movie made a great addition to our collection.
B002RI9YE6|5.0|This starts off quiet slow and you feel as if the story may not be worth the read even if the language he uses is so rich.<br />This is well worth sticking with though and the story turns out to be as beautiful as the language.<br /><br />He really draws you into the world of all the characters in this book and I grew very fond of Stevens and his extraordinary professional outlook on all aspects of his life.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|I bought this for my daughter for christmas. The movie and its case are in great condition. The movie made a great addition to our collection.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Elementary writing, but a very interesting story. Didn't see that end coming. Rather abrupt and quick to conclude. I will read the third book only to know how it all ends. Not expecting much.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I liked the free version so much that I just had to purchase the full game.  I love it!  Its one of the best mahjong games I have ever played.
B001MSMUH0|5.0|DR. Robinson has written a most inspiring book. Loved his examples of individuals who have found their Element. The section on reforming education is essential.
B007RTAR64|5.0|It was perfect. It was for my teenage granddaughter who loved the hunger games. ashe going to keep it as a collection.
B0011UBDTK|4.0|I am glad to have this set. My only complaint is that I wish that the discs were packaged a little differently.  Sliding them in and out of the cardboard sleeves I am afraid I will scratch them.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This has been my favorite book by far in the Fifty Shades Trilogy. I don't understand why people give these books bad reviews, because obviously people are buying them and reading it. It was a real page turner for me and I enjoyed that there was more action in this one than the first one.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|it is so totaly awesome if u like temple run get this game.  I hats it its not fun id have more fun sitting in an uncomfirtinle chair
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I really love this series so I was glad to purchase this set so I can watch it over and over.  I am loving the third season and will buy that at some future time.
B004SBQGHS|2.0|I keep losing my scores after be forced out & have to start all over.  I have tried powering off.  Chatted on-line & followed instructions, now I have to start again.
0425252868|5.0|Anyone who loves Aviation Must Read this Book!  It truly defines the camaraderie and brotherhood of aviation!  Its a emotional roller coaster all the way!  Franz and Charlie had me laughing, crying, and holding my breath as I read about there lives!  You will NEVER look at WWII the same way again!  I never imagined I would be rooting for a German WWII Fighter Pilot!  Get it, Read it, and I guarantee you, you will Love It as I did!
B00447G29S|5.0|This is one of the best 3d movies i have seen. My daughter and family love this movie a great addition to our collection.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love this game on the Kindle.  My husband and I rush to see who is going to get the Kindle first.
B00540G3G6|5.0|Love this movie so much 3d is not as great has some of the newer movie but technology has come a long way since this movie 1st came out
B0038LB4TE|5.0|Great story - very addictive! Love that the story is a modern issue and can strongly connect with the characters and the places, even though I have never been or certainly don't lead their lifestyles! Highly recommended.
B004APVI1G|5.0|Nice movie the 3d and blueray effects are awesome. Great movie to add to our collection. Daughter really enjoys myself as well.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I think its the best book ever made I hope you will enjoy this hilarious yet surprising book by Jeff Kinney
B006JSXYPA|5.0|Another great 3d movie the effects are so awesome. So real and awesome need to take a break since it is over 2 1/2 hours long.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very entertaining visually! I loved all the characters and the movement of the game. I only wish the game was longer!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The movie stayed true to the books, and I couldn't stop reading.<br />Can't wait for the sequel movie after reading all of these!
B008GBCMHO|5.0|I remember this movie from when I was a little girl and watched it with my little girl. I thought she'd really like it since she's obsessed with animals, espcially cats, and from the first time watching it it has been her favorite. I love the classical disney movies and the innocence of them. I'm glad my daughter loves it. The story is cute as well.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I cannot wait for the next book!  This is an author I will reread over and over just like Tolkein.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|I like this disney movie, not my fav, but I like the meaning behind the story. It's different from the most disney movies and I like that about it. I did have a problem with the disc itself and I bought the movie through Amazon. For some reason the blu ray disc wont play a couple of seconds at the very beggining of the movie and my blu ray player automatically turns the movie off so I have to wait for the part to come up and fast forward it so that it doesnt do that.
B0076DELIG|5.0|In the book Harry asks his daughter why she is sad as she nears the end of a book she is reading. Her response that she was sad it was almost over. Harry said he knew how she felt. I do too. Michael Connelly has once again written another masterpiece detective novel in The Black Box. Harry Bosch, the now DROP contracted detective for the LAPD cold case unit, is at once honorable, courageous and methodical in his quest for truth and justice. He has no time for the office politics and politicians that all of us can relate to in our own jobs. But if you have ever just tried to do your job the best you can, and been frustrated by those same office politics you will relate to Harry as he struggles to continue the investigation \\"in spite of\\" the human obstacles and gamesmanship. As always when I am done with a Michael Connelly novel, I am sad its over, and I can't wait for the next one. And especially the next Harry Bosch and what the future holds for his daughter as well.
B004F1F32A|3.0|Good movie if you had watched the first one so you knew the background but not fantastic because it was pretty predictable and somewhat corny in parts. The mom was not very believable in her part. The story line about human trafficking was a good way to bring that subject into discussion with our family tho
B0071CBBKS|4.0|I love this album. Fray's best album since their debut! Plenty of diversity (within their trademark sound). Can't say enough about this one.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is an all-around great game.  Not enough HO scenes to get tedious with lots of little mini-puzzles and put-it-together tasks in between.  Plenty of help with hints, skips, and a strategy guide built in to the app.  Thanks G5!  Keep `em coming!  Played beautifully on my Kindle Fire 2nd gen.  I think it took about 5 hours in casual mode.
1400067820|4.0|First of all, I am a big fan of Taleb and I work in a field with about as much uncertainty as one can have, so I have a personal stake in his ideas and how to apply them to everyday life.  I like his style:  in your face, irreverent, and with a big middle finger to the fragilistas of the world and what they're selling.  If I was wealthy and from a family as storied as his, I would be a flaneur as well.  But I'm not, so I'll keep this short and sweet, 'cuz I have other things to do-like the laundry.  So, after a first read-through, I have these initial impressions:  Taleb is NOT a good writer according to what is &#34;proper&#34; and taught in school today.  He goes on tangents, whole non-technical sentences are incomprehensible to my puny mind, and I have to reread whole sections just to understand a minor point.  But, I don't really care.  If you want an easy read, look elsewhere.  He still exposes some wonderful little items that seemed to have escaped the minds of people during the last couple thousand years, and names some big names in the process.  I liked &#34;Fooled by Randomness&#34; and &#34;The Black Swan&#34; better, but this one is good stuff.  Be &#34;robust,&#34; look for &#34;options,&#34; and be skeptical of anything that claims to be &#34;scientific.&#34;  And I SO wish I was Fat Tony.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Its Pinterest, whats not to love....<br /><br />I feel like every craft i see on here i can conquer!! Love it!!
B002MW50KO|5.0|its so different to other christmas albums and i'm not a Bob Dylan fan at all.<br />Christmas in the heart - Bob Dylan
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love the amazing graphics! its so life like. there are lots to do in the game. And the best part? there is unicorns!!!!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|First, let me state I'm a huge Sigourney Weaver fan. Aliens SE (1992) was my favorite movie for a substantial portion of my life time. All the aliens sequels were alright movies but not none worthy compared to the uncut Aliens. This movie does not have Sigourney Weaver in it, and yes the actress that plays her pseudo-role is not as good as the original. Regardless this movie is really awesome. Some people really want to hate on this for some reason. I think it is a great day for the canon of aliens. They are coming out with a sequel in 2014 that will diverge onto its own unique story arc. I think this &#34;reboot&#34; of Aliens is exactly what the series needed.<br /><br />Video quality and audio quality of the bluray is just. STUNNING.<br /><br />Equipment: Sharp Aquos 1080p 120hz LCD HDTV + PS3 over HDMI + 5.1 Logitech Z506
B0026PW67W|2.0|I was pretty bummed when I unfolded it. No, I didn't expect to see little footprints running around! But,I couldn't really determine where I was in it... Could have had a few more classrooms indicated and the dorms to help give better perspective. Yes, I know which charms to say and I tried them all! Maybe I am just a squib!
1906735875|5.0|Finally got a chance to check out these old Judge Dredd comics and I see where so many of todays science fiction films came from. Films like Total Recall, The Running Man...these little short stories are quick and fun to read and the art a good example of comic art from the 70's, highly recommended!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This story was amazing. I enjoyed it very much and could scarcely put it down a real page turner.  Kathleen Grisson did a fine job writing it. I will be looking for more of her writings.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|Retirement life in India? Maybe, but this is a fanciful depiction of it. All in all, a nice little movie.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This book only gets better every time I read it. I read it for the first time as a required reading in school and it has always stuck with me. This is probably the sixth time I have read this book and I always manage to get more out of it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Despite criticisms from the critics, it's a good watch especially for its attention to detail: a place and time before my time, recreated.
1419705849|5.0|My grandson was thrilled with the book. It has a good study binding which will be required for the many times it will be read.
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|Great read funny I had lots of fun reading it but the best is when you start the series .
B00AE2LJVS|1.0|Paid for hd movie, and got a really crapy version, seemed like it was bootlegged. The movie was good, just wish I got to actually see it clearly
B003WUYRGI|1.0|It doesn't have stuff about the presidents, or the Periodic Table. Nor planet info.<br />I for one do not like it.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I got Uno for the kids to play while we were traveling.  Turns out I love it as much as they do.  I play every evening.  It is a great game.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Wonderful book for ages 9 and up!! So interesting, that you will never want to stop! Great for book clubs too.
B007SGM084|5.0|All three books were great but definitely not for the faint of heart!! Once you start reading them, they are hard to put down.
B008OOYALE|5.0|it is a great game and you get to talk to new people with out them knowing your real name.
B000002URV|4.0|I had this album  10 years ago and got it once again.  This was and still is one of the best from Enigma, would strongly recommend if you like this genre of music.
B00A757EFW|2.0|I enjoyed playing the game altho my experience with the controls were not very good therefore I did not have much sucess with it.
B009XY97VC|4.0|Good but not quite as good as their first two albums but I would buy it if you like those.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use evernote for everything from meeting notes and pictures of whiteboard notes to knitting patterns.<br /><br />I always have access to what I'm looking for on whatever device I have handy.<br /><br />Excellent search means I can always find what I'm looking for.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I always liked solitaire and this satifies my need .I like it at a time that i'm not in the mood for a  tough puzzle
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The large visual keys and pastel colors make this calculator easy on the eyes and easy to use.  It's great to have a calculator on my Amazon Kindle Fire, which I'm using for everything.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Wow what a great game ,just when you think you have it mastered  you have to rethink it again ,love it
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent book!  I will read more by this author and recommend it to my friends. Especially loved the surprise ending.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|While some of the original Beach Boys are no longer with us, the sound still rings true after 50 years. While the album might not be stellar, the title track alone is worth the price of the disk and the memories the sounds bring are priceless!
0979019710|5.0|Hal Elrod gives practical, step-by-step advice for best practices that are guaranteed to help you get the most out of life IF you follow them.  I'm on day 5 of practicing &#34;the Miracle Morning&#34; and already I have seen positive results...not only in how I feel, but in my work (had a terrific sales week), and in my family relationships.<br />Don't read unless you are ready to &#34;take the plunge&#34; and follow Hal's miracle morning plan for 30 straight days.Things that didn't completely resonate with me while reading the book are very much making sense now that I'm putting his morning routine into practice.  Thanks Hal, for sharing your insight.  It's easy to see that anyone can live a level 10 life with a little daily discipline.  I felt like a kid at Christmas this week!  :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great read for tween to adult. Funny and sad. Hazel the main character has great names for all her medical equipment and other cancer patients.
B002ZG98FU|5.0|Star-studded cast . . . you can't go wrong with Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton.  The war waged between their characters keeps you laughing and offers an unexpected ending to the movie.  The young love-interest story is also fun, and the acting is great.  Just a good romantic comedy.
B007PJFIU6|5.0|We're a little odd at our house, and this game seems to be made for us.  This is a great family game or for a get together with friends.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|No problems with download or the game . . . the different holiday venues are imaginative and fun!  My whole family enjoys it.
1481251880|5.0|I read the book overnight. This is a record time for me. Loved the book, loved the characters. I hope they make a movie.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I actually don't mind letting my 5 year old son play this game.  He has an interest in engineering and how things are put together, so this game is a challenge for him (and for me!).  Having to construct the vehicle out of the items you are given is sometimes tough.  I love the background music, though, and I think it's a fun game.  Better than Angry Birds.
030758836X|3.0|The book could've been written in 200 pages vs 400+. I didn't hate the book. Was intrigued enough to finish it, but definitely didn't love it. It didn't make my \\"would read again\\" list.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|you run and dash and I Lilyana nine year old girl love it so much I could play it all day
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book held my interest and I was always eager to get back to it,<br />I recommend to readers of Kindle
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I t was pleasantly surprised at the depth and graphics of this live action prequel to the Halo 4 universe. In specific to the commander of UNSC Inifinity :cadet Laskey
0064410935|2.0|I thought it was for a 3 yr old....maybe for a 5 the grader..love the story....wished the seller made it more clear, no pictures....and the level for reading...
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is so much fun and some of the people I've seen has some of the most beautiful pictures and I will never get to go but they are wonderful to look at....
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Is this a work of fiction or not?  This is a well-written book about an amazing adventure. I read reviews that said the book starts slow but I didn't mind the family-life portion. Pi is funny and his observations are genius. This could be an amazing adventure book for the mature teen reader. A great story and I can't wait to see the film.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Absolutely beautifully written. Genuine raw emotion from realistic characters. The real life struggles to get to a happy ending ending rather than fairy tale stories. LOVED IT!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Just like the computer version.  Fun to play, but gets boring after a while.  Has three different versions to play.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|The Kindle app is not as good as the Ios app. It doesn't allow you to do some things such as go to prior days in the reading plans. It little bit quirky. Still worth getting.
0793518326|4.0|The fonts are too small for me.  I would have gladly paid more money for fonts on bigger pages, spiral bound would have been better.<br /><br />I like that the songs are arranged in alphabetical order, so it is easily flip pages to find a song quickly.<br /><br />Playing songs on guitar and piano by reading tabs, chords and notation is fun.  I was tired of looking up songs on internet with incomplete and incorrect scores. This book gets you very close. I am not a professional musician, so works for me.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|This item was purchased as a gift, for my son who works with heavy equipment and pumps at a salt mine. He has been very pleased with the versatility and quality of this tool. It also came with a carrying case , he could slide onto his belt or place in the cab and likes that feature as well.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was a quick easy read with a happy ending after a few twists along the way!  I think we all have that dream of finding this type of unbelievable perfect love.
B0086700CM|2.0|My daughter loved this game, but it caused my Kindle Fire to act up and go all jinky. My icons disappeared and even after I rebooted, they still weren't there. Deleted it.
B000B589JI|5.0|This holds exactly the amount required to fill a standard zippo lighter. I keep it in my pack just in case.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is the easiest and most fun to watch version of this amazing work of Charles Dickens.  Children understand the message and don't get lost in the 'old language'.
B006M9NJFG|5.0|the best canteen out there on the market and the canteen cup exceeds military specs for cooking or heating up warm drinks. I own several and they are indespinsable in the bush.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|I did not know much about this group until I heard one song, \\"If I Die Young\\". I then decided that I would check out more songs from this artist. Well so glad that I did! I have listened to this CD several times since purchasing it online at Amazon right before Christmas. People of all ages have enjoyed this CD as well. My thoughts are that this would be a good CD for cleaning the house or just hanging out doing anything. I am so happy that I decided to purchase this CD. If you're unsure listen to some of the songs ahead of time to see if you like what you hear. Hope you do! I'm sure you will enjoy this CD as much as we do.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie and intend to buy the DVD as soon as I am able to do so.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I gave this as a gift and I haven't received much feedback but it was a high item on her want list so I'm sure it was a hit. Karen R. Carlson
B008ASLK8A|5.0|This movie was a ton of fun.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I would watch it again in a heartbeat.  It was also easy to do on Amazon through our playstation.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This was bought as a gift for my daughter's boyfriend and he loved it.  They were excited to start watching them
B007C9N4H8|5.0|I really like using Amazon to rent movies.  It is right at your fingertips.  Very easy to access and just as affordable as going out and renting it.

B004EPYZPS|5.0|I like science fiction.  This is yet another movie that I would recommend to any science fiction fans. It is outstanding to me.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Oh God just read this already. I'm glad I'm done so that I can have my life back. I haven't eaten a proper meal since picking this up. This is seriously the best new author I've read in probably a decade. I will now be forcing my friends to read this series so that I can share the pain. I seriously did not expect -cut to avoid spoilers- to the end.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|I like science fiction.  This is yet another movie that I would recommend to any science fiction fans. It is outstanding to me.
B00005N6KG|1.0|I had used these for many years. The quality of the headphones is getting worse. I used it 3 times and I can't hear out of 1 side.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|I have greatly enjoyed the Bourne movies.  I would recommend them to any one who likes action and can understand a little vigilanty justice.  The DVD that I ordered was in very good condition.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Thank what a great book along with a great man. You know the closes think to being a Super man is a Navy Seal.
B004EPZ034|5.0|My little grandchildren seem to like everything that has anything to do with Alvin and the chipmunks.  If you have grandchildren ages 4 and under, I would recommend giving Alvin a chance to entertain them.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I can quickly and simply write and maintain notes across my tablet, phone, and laptop.  Syncs automatically and allows me to keep multiple notebooks with all my data.
B00000ILDF|4.0|Although Aliens (sometimes called Alien 2), is to me the best movie in the series of alien movies, this one and the first one are also good to me. The DVD quality of the one that I purchased is also very good.
B003L77G10|5.0|I Loved the 2nd Season  of the Good Wife for the great price and very fast delivery.  The Good Wife was brand new in its original package and I was spellbound by the story..
B001C08RHA|5.0|I recommend this movie to all Scifi fans who also enjoy marvel commics.  It was nice to see R. Downey Jr. playing a grown up, who becomes a super hero.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Vintage Harry Bosch.  Great book.  Fast easy read.  If you like Harry, you will love this book.  Can't wait for more.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I am a big fan of this series. Vin and Paul are at the top of my favorite actor list. If yo9u like action and cars this is definitely a movie for you. Also, this is the first movie of Dwayne's that I could watch and not be thinking of The Rock for the whole movie.
B002APU580|5.0|This film is a great adaptation of the classical book. I found it flawless, the actors are perfectly chosen, their performances as well as the direction is perfect.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Love it! perfect functional addition to my Kindle. Works as stated and no complaints from me.Get it you will love it.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Absolutely love Downton Abbey. Would recommend it to anyone. Worth every penny.<br />We watch one or more episodes every night.
0765325950|5.0|Wow.....<br /><br />This would be the first time I've sat down to write a review on Amazon - but feel somewhat compelled to. Complements (exactly what it means) of my father and his trash fantasy/SF collection from god knows when, I started reading books at a young age....this was the first series I ever picked up next to \\"Flinx\\" by Alan Dean Foster.<br /><br />So, colored by that (for the best really), and despite the fact that there are so many disparaging reviews of Robert Jordan and the series in its various stages, manifestations, false starts, and (seemingly impossible to contract) network of ever expanding plot lines ----- I'm happy to say that it was one of the best reads I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying. Not because of its perfect writing, almost stupidly intense attention to detail (which fades to a certain extent with Brandon Sanderson), bizarre complications - or anything so noticeable. The series held me waiting, re-reading periodically, and frustrated at the lack of finality from my childhood to my adulthood.<br /><br />It's over....and absolutely worth every moment....to the point of tears. It jumps substantially ahead of where the last book left off (time and other to be fair), it isn't EXACTLY what I expected ('course it's a different author who has done a remarkable job of blending styles together)....but, it IS all the action missing that COULD have condensed the other books. It has all the heart wrenching losses of a good climax, and there is a movie-esque sense of closure (read into that what you will), and it does entertain....to the point my wife slept along till 1:30am last night as I kept planning to \\"come to bed when I finish this *insert*....\\"<br /><br />To put it to the numbers - I spent 15 years reading 12,000ish pages, and 4.4M+ words - at the end of that, I want to start it again and go from start to finish in one fell swoop.<br /><br />Can't think of anything else that has occupied my time that much...er...except the wife....thekid....the dog....the job....this was a nice vacation, one that has spanned from my adolescence to my \\"maturity\\".<br /><br />Cheers!
B004TTHLBE|5.0|If you enjoyed Sandman, you're going to love this book. It has it all: odd, yet lovable characters, harsh truths, cruel but touching statements, deep allegories of the present and past and most of all, a beautifully-structured plot with a twist at the end. Not to mention the strokes of mythology that are all over the place. I'm glad I bought it, it was worth every penny.
1427206465|5.0|This gave my grandson another version of hearing the story that he had read and made it a lot more interesting.
B0052RE4MQ|1.0|I've been on a YA kick lately so, of course, I had to give the MATCHED series a try. I had high hopes going into it. Who doesn't love a good love-triangle, right? MATCHED, itself, was actually a pretty good read. The characters were well-developed and the book had a nice pace to it. It left you with just enough invested to pick up book two (CROSSED). Here is where my problem lies. Book two, what a bore! Coming off of MATCHED, Ally Condie pumped the breaks in the most devastating way in CROSSED. It was a big snooze fest and, therefore, killed the entire series for me. I was so bored throughout CROSSED that I completely lost interest in the characters and their plight. Needless to say, I will not be reading REACHED.<br />If you've read the synopsis and think the story line sounds interesting enough, do yourself a favor and buy Lauren Oliver's DELIRIUM instead. It's similar in that it's a dystopian love story and unlike, CROSSED, PANDEMONIUM (book two) is everybit as enjoyable as book one.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It provides hours of fun for my whole family all while helping to build critical thinking skills. Tons of levels and lots of skill
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, I couldn't wait to read the next two books to see what happened to them.
0765325950|5.0|As a fan from book one, I can wholeheartedly recommend this final legacy of The Wheel of Time series. Gripping story telling had me finishing it in two days, staying up far too late each evening to do so. Robert Jordans work has a permanent place on my shelf. Thank you to his family for allowing someone else to take his ideas and craft them into a final form after his untimely passing, I am grateful I had the chance to take that ride.
0060730552|5.0|Joe Simpson has a great story for you about himself and a climbing buddy. Boy stuff goes wrong and, oh no, survival situation. Joe Simpsons' is no joke. How he goes on is amazing to read about. He stared death down for days and beats him back on his slow climb down to base camp.
B007PKSN6Q|3.0|Took forever to get and then got misdelivered by post office the party called to say they had it even though package was ripped and case cracked
B000VBIGD6|5.0|One of the very best Christmas movies of all time! This movie is funny every year, over and over. We never get tired of it.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I learned a lot about the war in Iraq that I did not know before and knew very little about seals before I read this as well. Had a few good life lessons in the book too.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The story had a completely different premise than I realized, having not read what it was about before buying. I really enjoyed how the author took mildly intimate moments and made them beautiful, not racy. Fun!
B002APU580|5.0|This movie version is very entertaining and the performance by all the actors was academy award winning, The casting director did the job, and the director was incredible.  Kiera Knightly  and Mathew Macfadyen were superb!!  If I didn't know better I would have thought Mathew was truly in love with Kiera, I have never seen such a performance.  It is one of my favorite movies.  I never get tried of viewing this movie.  It is a delight......
B00000294R|5.0|Glad I bought this record, I've heard great things about Big L but didn't know much of his music. Now I know why he's well-liked, his rapping's great, over excellent old-school jazzy samples. A bit excessive and too matter-of-fact on anti-gay lines though...
B003KK65KG|4.0|It was interesting to see each side of the problem.  Bullying is a terrible thing and it can make you do things you wouldn't believe you could do under normal circumstances.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I have been looking for this game since I played it on my sister's ipad.  I am very happy that I can now get it for my kindle
B0094WK9GU|5.0|Its one of those album that you wait for and once you get a taste of it, there is no turning back!!
B0027MJU00|4.0|This was a great read. Interesting characters, unique story line, well written.  Just ordered two mote of Flynn books.  Can't wait to get started!
B000GCFO08|2.0|I got this movie used thinking 'hey' I've bought used stuff before it will work fine! But no it skips and I gave it to someone as a gift. I've really learned my lesson.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game is great. -A good time-passer and no shuffeling or dealing and what can beat free?  If you like to play solitaire you will love this app.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Thought the movie was fantastic.  Same director as with Fireproof.  Acting was so much better.  All fathers should take the time to watch it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book! It was a little over the top and a lot unbelievable, but I loved it! It was sweet.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Best book I've read in a long while! There are lots of books about videogames but this one is by far the greatest!
B00973902K|5.0|&#34;Call Me Maybe' is definitely the song of 2012! Listen to it all the time...probably more than a person should!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book was great can't wait till the next one to come out! Pretty much all his books have been great!
B008NBEXZQ|5.0|Have always been a fan of her music and Québeçois heritage...use her music both in the classroom and for personal enjoyment..this is one of the best ...love a Cd that is entirely in French..merci.
B0091QS88K|4.0|My two year old granddaughter loves this game. I gave it four stars because it keeps trying to sell full version and she can't figure how to get back to her game
B000FC10WU|5.0|It is hard not to appreciate the style and sophistication of Agatha Christie's writing. The characters and the plot are<br />well defined and the ending plausible.I look forward to reading more abiut Miss Marple.
1440503257|5.0|Who thought a cookbook about British foods could make an eight year old so happy?! After working through the HArry Potter books with two daughters, I loved the book as well. Fun for kids and adults.
1423107233|5.0|good price for a great book.  Added to the series that I have collected.  very well done and looks great in my library.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Loved this book. You would think a story told mostly from reading log book entries would be boring, lacking excitement, and provide little reader involvement with the main character. Not so here! Andy Weir has done an amazing job of telling this story in an exciting, gripping, and can't put it down way.<br /><br />A marvelous journey that I thoroughly enjoyed. Solid 5 stars. And all for 99 cents!
142313866X|5.0|what a great book. this one was a little hard to find at the time I purchased it, but Im very plesed that I found it.
1250007305|5.0|I purchased this book as a gift for my son-in-law. It was on his wishlist. He said he absolutely loved it!
1423117166|5.0|very nice, quality and at a  great price this purchase completed my collection of this series and I could not be more pleased with this item.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very enjoyable.  fun for kids of all ages. one of the most realistic  apps out there. a good time killer. and i like that they dont keep asking you to spend real money.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Hilarious! Looked like it would be really bad but decided to give it a go. Purchased it after watching it was so good
B002M9WW30|5.0|rocky will always be a classic. absolutely worth owning the collection. bought it for my husband for christmas and he loved it.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game seems like you are endlessly chasing after the animals. Some are caught easily, but others are extremely difficult to catch. I wasted a lot of peanuts doing this! Thankfully, now it seems peanuts are given every day you play. Game is fun, but the wait in between main levels to get new animals takes forever. Would recommend because it is free and now peanuts are received on more regular basis.
B002VHI8J0|1.0|Read it to the end as it was recommended, but.... Still don't get it?!...would love to discuss it with someone.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|First read of 2013 and what a story !!<br /><br />Loved every bit of it and it got me from the very beginning already.<br /><br />The whole story is told very well and never goes down througout the whole book.<br /><br />As Sky was referring to her life as a book i know that there was something terrible coming and O.M.G. I felt my heart stopped beating when i got to that point. I had some suspicions already but never thought this could be it..... From that moment on i got pulled to the end and i wanted so much everything would turn out fine for her and Holder.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to everyone. The book is a great story filled with lots of emotions.
145162607X|2.0|I was disappointed in this novel.  I am normally a huge Philippa Gregory fan - and had been looking forward to this book, but I was very disappointed with it.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this book. What a nice surprise! Strayed's descriptions of her adventures on the trail kept me reading, often feeling as if I were actually there with her. I laughed, I held my breath more than a few times, and I cheered at the end. I'm now a fan of this author, for sure.
0979019753|1.0|Just when you thought there was no room for any more self development books, the Miracle Morning is the latest attempt to get some money out of your pocket in exchange for telling you something you knew all along:  get up early so you can take stock of your day, don't dwell on the past, don't mix with people who drag you down and stay focussed on what you want to achieve.  All these kinds of books have their own unique gimmick which is described in a catchy way.  Just saying \\"get up early\\" is boring - \\"miracle morning\\" is the buzz word of choice in this little tome.  The author presents himself as a truly remarkable human being who has overcome great diversity and is a wonderful salesman who has broken sales records in the company he worked for at an early age.  The guy does know how to sell but that doesn't mean that *you* are going to be able to sell whatever it is that you are trying to sell if there are no buyers for your acting talents or your writing talents or whatever - and that is a fact, no matter how many affirmations you do or how dangerously sleep deprived you become.  For that is where this book stops being a harmless mood lifter to encouraging people to go for way less sleep than they need.  Getting up early is one thing but the kind of sleep deprivation the author proposes can have serious negative effects such as lack of concentration which can be extremely dangerous if driving or operating machinery and it sure isn't good for the complexion.  A waste of money.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|If you've read the other Abercrombie books this is a no brainer, buy it! If you haven't read the others and you like gritty fantasy, read the others first, then buy this one. You'll get more out of Red Country if you're familiar with the other books. If you don't feel like reading 5 other books first, buy this as an introduction to the Abercrombie universe , then reread it after you've gone through the others.<br /><br />Say one thing for Joe Abercrombie, he writes books I like.
B000JFDBXO|3.0|Decent plot, great effects as usual. I liked it. I hope there is another one in the series. Lot of changes in this one, so we'll see.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Awesome!! Loved the entire series! Hope you give it a look. My first entire series. I usually get bored and stop reading.
B000YHG72E|4.0|I am not a fun of everything Will Ferrell does, but his performance in Elf is absolutely delightful,and the film will stand up well over time.  This is one we'll probably re-watch every year.
B009P5S11G|5.0|So this album is very different from her past albums. She has more slow tempo songs on here but they are songs done from a more personal perspective. And a loyal fan lk me can appreciate that. She allows people to see more of her in this album. As usual she has one song on there that shows her barbadian roots and that one is \\"no love allowed\\". Really good song. My favorites are \\"stay\\" \\"what now\\" \\"right now\\" and \\"lost in paradise\\". She also does a collabo with future, eminem. If you loved rihanna s past albums cuz of all the upbeat dance songs then this album may disappoint you. But if you want to see a different more vulnerable album from her then this is it. One thing I will also say is the dvd is short. 20 min. I would have been happy with lk five min. More but it was nice to see her on it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|AMAZING. This book is such an incredibly new experience in reading for me. So intense and dark. COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN.
B00005KISG|1.0|The DVD will not play in the U.S.  When I initially ordered it, I was not aware that Region 2 would not play in the U.S.  In addition, the vendor will only accept a return if I eat the shipping.  Not acceptable.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Hey guys I know you think it's cool and I do to but when I play it you can't sleep or eat .......ARE YOU SERIOUS I had spent most of my time building a bed ready to sleep but it did not let me sleep. Also when it was night and I had a iron soward but there were no mobs.<br />So I just play the real minecraft
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Loved David on American Idol.  I didn't know he would be such a good song writer but love the lyrics on all of his songs.  I've listen to them over and over.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I loved this book. Loved seeing her mother and  mine, on the other side of the river. What an amazing adventure.
B004WOS3P4|5.0|Listen to this one over and over.  Love the lyrics of several of the songs. He is a good song writer.
B001AQIYJC|5.0|A touching romantic movie. Nicolas & Meg are great in this movie. Did not like the way it ended though.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|The movie was thoughtful and funny and right on target. Anna Kendrick is a great young actress and she was well supported by the entire ensemble. Best of all, the choice of songs and their performance was memorable
B00AFROVQC|5.0|My grandson picked this book to do a book report on so I decided to read it also.  He is just on Chapter 3 & I have completed the book.  It was excellent & I went looking for the 2nd one & was so disappointed to find out it is not out yet. I can't wait to read the next one & find out what happens.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|You move this box with out falling off the edge right?  Well, it is slot of fun.  You can use your finger or by tilting your device.  It's FUN!!  I recommend it to all.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|This is about the fifth or sixth time I've read &#34;American Gods.&#34;  I started looking for the paperback at home a few months ago, and couldn't find it anywhere. (I have well over 2,000 books in my house, not terribly organized yet.) The standard edition was a bit steep for my budget on Kindle, but this edition's quite low price point made it a natural.  If you have a older Kindle like mine (which has since perished) you will NOT be able to access the video content, however don't let that stop you from picking this masterpiece up, since you might upgrade in the future, or access the material through the app or Cloud Reader.<br /><br />On to the book itself.<br /><br />The premise of this work is fantastic - essentially that where people travel, their believes travel with them, and depending on the sincerity or quantity of that belief, their gods walk the real world, and can be affected by the real world.  The entire work is an examination of belief, belief systems, and in some ways, what would gods, some modern and some ancient, think of our world. What would they do in their day-to-day existence, and what happens whey their believers drift away, die out, move on?  Read everything in this book, including Mr. Gaiman's explanation of how he traveled through the U.S. while writing the book, it's well worth it, and adds a haunting feeling of 'Neil was there watching' aspect to the work.<br /><br />There is another book, related to this one by one character really, called Anansi Boys, that is more humorous, and also worth the read.
B001FAFO3W|4.0|I've been wanting to watch this movie for awhile and finally decided to buy it. The price was worth it and the movie arrived quickly and in great shape.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Not bad for a free app or to kill time for a few hours. I didn't like that you had to earn or buy points to unlock all but a few games, though I will say that they are moderately generous with giving points for visiting sponsors, etc. The games were just not my style.
B000LC55F2|4.0|This movie definitely keeps you interested. Once you finish it, you will want to watch it over and over. Hugh Jackman and Christain Bale both did a wonderful job. The movie arrived quickly and undamaged.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Would like this game better if it saved so you could start from where you ended. Hate starting over each time I want to play.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|To understand survival sometimes is to live it and make it worth living. I can't wait to see the movie now.
B004EPZ00C|5.0|She loved it anything bean is for her she laughes so hard at his antics that she has tears running
B008Y2VTIS|1.0|This is the worst of the series and I had to pay for it on top on that. Not Good
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I bought this CD for one song but enjoy the entire album!  What a pleasant surprise.  Thank you Bruno Mars.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is not like any other game.  This game is the best ever. Even though it costs $1.99 it's worth every penny you spend.
B003ZDZ1WG|2.0|I bought this CD because of the single, If I die young.  It has turned out that I like all these songs.<br />Thank you Band Perry.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|I had no room when instantly finished the animal and now I can put the animal in storage or do anything nor can I play the game
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|1st book we read in The Girls Book Club, and it was great!!! Now I need to read her other books!!!
B00571F26Y|5.0|this book is a true companion to Dr. Atkin's approach to healthy eating and is quite a bit more user friendly for a true lifestyle change
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my dad has this game on his smart phone and I always play it so I saw they have it for the fire.YAH!!!!!! so now I can play this on my fire and this game is so much fun and the quality is super duper good
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Great app easy to download and works better than my iphone app. And it is more responsive it seems on my Kindle than the iphone.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|so you download the game for free with no pay then you click the game and start to play and you have to buy it what the?
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|The first diary of a wimpy kid book is the best of the best. It tells you the vary first about the characters.
B00A757EFW|5.0|hahahahaha I absulutley LOVE pacman. I love this game. the joystick was very hard to control at first but I got used to it very quicly. I absulutley love this game and so should you because it is great quality and great game to!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|state of the art for hidden object adventure quest games. nice graphics. wide variety of tasks. gotta pay to keep playing :(
1419705849|5.0|My son loves the entire Wimpy Kid series of books, this is no exception.  He laughs as he reads it and reads it over and over, just like the rest.  Well done, once again Mr. Kinney.
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|I wasn't sure about this movie in the beginning, but I actually really liked it.  It did have some plot points from other horror movies and nothing was terribly original about it, but it was entertaining and you actually cared about the characters.  A good watch for sure.
B009B2U73I|5.0|Dianna Krall is just SUPER!!!<br /><br />Just GREAT!!!<br />Nice to have this on the Cloud.<br /><br />Always enjoy  Amazon's Music and the reviews you show,<br /><br />Don Coleman
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is just what I was looking for.  Something simple and easy to use, yet addresses all I wanted it to.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A wonderful love story with heart pounding effects.  It a novel that is written in a clean fashion and doesn't need to be smutty to feel the love of the characters.
B0000047BA|5.0|I have been listening to the music of Miles Davis since I was 13 (now I'm 66). That's why I bought this cd also. This is quite interesting music with Miles in an unconventional surrounding. And the music is swinging and beautiful. If you are interested in Miles' playing then you should try this one too.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I've not finished this book yet, but it's another page turner, just like &#34;Sharp Objects&#34; and &#34;Dark Places&#34;, her<br />first two books.  Great, realistic writing.
B006I1OB0U|5.0|....you'll already have this 2011 Xmas Special. Don't buy both. May equally apply to 2012 Christmas show, and S3 box-set. That said, story line and production values are as high as ever.
B0056K4VRM|4.0|...but 2 not so great. The price is low, so you still get your money's worth. CDs 1-3 get five stars; CD 5 gets 4 stars; CDs 4 & 6 get 3 stars. So that averages to about 4 stars. The first three CDs alone are worth the price, since they are probably the best recordings of Mozart's late symphonies, opera overtures, Eine Kleine Nachtmusik and Masonic Funeral Music. The orchestra is bigger and tempos broader than is fashionable today for this repertoire, but I prefer that, especially for the symphonies. Mozart's late symphonies can sound charming and light with a small period orchestra, or monumentally powerful with a larger modern one, closer to Beethoven's visionary creations. Which would you rather hear?<br /><br />The main problem with the other CDs is the mono recordings. I don't have a problem with mono per se, and a few of my favorite recordings are mono. But this is poor quality even for mono, rendering them almost unlistenable. Besides, there are plenty of other great recordings of the Requiem, etc available in better sound.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I have now read all of Kate Morton's books, and would definitely call myself a big fan. I looked forward to this book release from the time I saw the \\"pre-orders\\" become available during the summer, and it did not disappoint.<br /><br />The author has an easy style of seamlessly interweaving stories from different times and places, slowly unravelling her characters as she reveals tidbits of her plot to the reader, teasing details through page after page.<br /><br />This book kept my interest piqued until everything wound beautifully together in the end.<br /><br />Read it! And check out her other books if you haven't already.
B006XOBFJC|5.0|...for an insanely low price! I like this Ring almost as much as Solti's, and it would be just about as great if the Brunhilde singer Jeannine Altmeyer was a match for Solti's. She is not bad, but once you've heard Birgit Nilsson, you can't help comparing all other Brunhildes to her, and they inevitably fall short. This Brunhilde is more feminine and vulnerable, which works for some scenes. But she can't quite produce the power of Nilsson for the scenes where Brunhilde is a dominant, commanding figure. Her singing is always good though, and doesn't require the deduction of a star for this review.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|A friend completely raved about this movie when she saw it in the theatre, so I was excited to watch it when it was released on \\"video\\".<br /><br />I love almost all of the actors in this movie - who wouldn't? They have such pedigree! The cast was something like a \\"best-of-Britain\\". And they each played their parts beautifully. The cinematography cast a magical air about the story, the scenery was stunning.<br /><br />But even with all of these things in favour of the movie, I found the storyline ultimately very weak which was such a shame. If you choose to watch the movie, enjoy the atmosphere of this movie, but don't expect anything too deep.
B001VNB54A|5.0|We actually bought this one as a gift for my father-in-law, but already own it ourselves.  Great series for all history buffs.
B007THA4FI|5.0|(yes, I am a Harry Potter fan)<br /><br />I found the polarized reviews of this book intriguing. I usually rely on Amazon reviews to guide me away from the worst on offer, so that mediocre is the most I can complain about! I apply a 10% rule - if the number of 1-star reviews is less than 10% of the number of 5-star reviews, then it's probably good enough. This book is an anomaly to my rule of thumb.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is certainly a slow burner, and not for the feint hearted. It is a beautifully observed commentary on modern life, on our prejudices, our hopes, our fears. The story is at times very dark, and human nature is resilient in how those who could have done more are convinced so easily that they had good reasons to not.<br /><br />When I finished this book, it was several weeks before I could pick up something new to read. This book has left a mark. It has made me reflect. It was not an easy read, but it was a wonderful read.
B0088WFZQG|5.0|We enjoyed the movie. Great storyline and a lot of action. Rented it for 24 hours and ended up watching it twice.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Awesome....couldn't put it down!!!!! I even put off shopping to finish the book!!!  I really enjoyed all the twists...I  loved it
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Great Book-  very interesting to think about what is normal in this country .  Keeps you rivited the whole story.
B008518MOW|5.0|what can I say it is a movie that came in good condition cant wait to watch it and put it in the collection.
0812984412|4.0|What an incredibly dense read. I loved the book, but as my sister said so aptly, \\"It was hard work.\\" I didn't mind flitting from story to story, as some have mentioned in their reviews. I thought the characters were interesting and well-developed, even though there were few of them that I really liked. Most of them I detested, which left me wondering about the point of the book. Fate, reincarnation, the soul, and the morality of actions were all strong themes but didn't really point to any kind of answer. It's possible that Mitchell was just saying, \\"Life is a wild ride. Who we are is sculpted by what we do, but we are also sculpted by fate. The universe is a mystery and who knows where this is all headed.\\" If you are the kind of person who prefers for a story to be tied up in a neat bow by the time you get to the end, I would not recommend this book. But if you're OK with no real end and just like contemplating the universe, this may be a good choice for you.
6301792734|5.0|My kids loved it and it brought me back in time to when I was a kid .i highly recommend the trilogy set .
B0050SYS5A|5.0|This is a wonderful product for small areas. My husband could not play the games until I got him this for Christmas.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great historical fiction which is one of my weakness, hope for more.<br /><br />Will continue too look for more from Follett.
6305428271|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie and to be able to find it for so cheap was awesome!! I also received it right away.. Within two days!
B006LSZECO|3.0|A good roller coaster adventure. Surprising twist and turns. Was a little disappointed with the ending but that may be a personal preference
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I have read better from Grisham<br />It is a fair story. Some predictable.<br />I like Grisham but this one is not the best.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I have a difficult time with reading and watching things about the Holocaust.  Viktor Frankl's accounts are intense and disturbing, but only by description in service of his supporting how finding purpose in the darkest circumstances can for for the human spirit, and ultimately survival.  It is not a book about the suffering and the horror.  In fact, his writing about his years in the camps offers a perspective that few could ever come to on their own.  His conviction that a fulfilled life comes from finding meaning in what one does, day to day, is convincing and I have seen it played out in my life, with my friends, and in my work time and time again.  It is not a treatise on finding an overarching meaning for one's life as a whole – that would be overwhelming – and he insists not possible until our death.  It is a must read if one in interested in looking and moving forward, and not wallowing in the past.  Actually, it's a must read for them, too.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|One of the best music albums. I really enjoy listening Mumford & Sons.<br />You will find yourself singing their sons shortly
1579121306|5.0|My son is only 10, but he loves chess and will spend hours online analyzing the games of the great players.  This book is perfect for him - when he doesn't have anyone to play chess with him he can work on sharpening his game.  This is definitely not a kids' book - the problems are challenging and will keep any chess player busy for a long time.
030758836X|1.0|Not worth even one star. The ending is not just bad, it is totally unbelievable. I cannot believe it would happen even in a fictional story.
B004YM6JP0|5.0|This is an amazing series. Each season has been getting better each year. Damon and Elena's friendship evolves a lot this season
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another great Jack Reacher book.  As usual, Reacher makes most of his own troubles, but even more in this story than usual.  If you are a fan this will not disappoint, if you are new, start here and then go on to others.  All of the books stand alone.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|There is too much to say about this show. It is brilliant.  Being expertly written, produced, and acted, this show is suitable for both genders, and anyone over the age of 12 (as there is some material that wouldn't be suitable viewing for young children). The show keeps it realistic and captivating with true-to history events, lifestyle, and cultures,  which is just something you don't find too often in todays over-the-top-sexed and overly-violent-blood-thirsty TV dramas that will do anything shocking for ratings. This show is a massive international success because they keep it classy, keep it realistic, and do it SO well. I highly recommend this show to anyone over the age of 12, and I can't wait for season 3!
B002XTXG1G|5.0|He says that this is now his favorite movie ever.  I have never seen it, but will have to sit down and watch it one day based on his review and raves.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I LOVED LOVED LOVED this movie!<br /><br />Ostensibly the tale of a rebellious princess, the underlying messages of love, family, self-esteem and, especially, mother-daughter relations are not just for children. Everyone can benefit from the thoughts behind one of the best-animated movies I've ever seen. The young princess's hair is so real you can touch it, and that kind of detail is in every single frame! And I wonder if the animators had actors in mind when they drew the characters, so fine is the fit of appearance and voice. Kelly Macdonald as Merida and Billy Connolly as King Fergus are incomparable!<br /><br />If you have children, especially girls, you owe it to them to buy this movie. And if you don't have children, you owe it to YOURSELF to buy this movie! :)
B00003CXRM|5.0|this is the tale of the Odyssey retold in modern times an with more modern characters.  Our hero wanders through trials and tests as he winds his way back to the arms of his loving wife and family.
B00068O2PU|5.0|Nightwish has again produced a masterpiece. Although not quite as symphonic as some of their other albums, Once is still very much an obvious product of the great minds and musicians in this amazing group. I have the Oceanborn (Reis) album and the Greatest Hits album as well as Once, and I must say that each one has its own special magic, but all of them are very much Nightwish. Buy this disk and fall in love with them all over again!
B008NA3I30|5.0|Take This Waltz is a slow moving quirky movie. There was something unique about this film, something that caught my attention from the first moment.<br /><br />The film opens with a beautiful song, light quirky words, slightly on the folk side. The opening montage is a set of close ups of Margot making cup cakes. One of the last shots is of her sitting in front of the oven, a man in shorts walks past and the montage ends with an out of focus shot of the man standing in front of a bright window. I describe this very carefully because the film closes with exactly this same series of shots. They are identical, except for one small detail; the man is wearing long pants.<br /><br />The film then moves to a town on the east coast of Canada where Margot writes the new brochure copy for a Colonial town. A man taunts her to participate in a mock flogging. He ends up sitting next to her on the plane home. Turns out he lives across the street and they share a cab home, as they part ways she says under her breath, \\"I'm married.\\" Margot is married to Lou, a chef writing a chicken cookbook.<br /><br />This next paragraph has spoilers in it. If you would rather not know some details, skip this paragraph.<br />Ultimately, Margot ends up having an affair with Daniel. The literal interpretation of this affair is that she is a horrible person, doing what so many people do. She should be in love with her funny schlub of a husband. Her life is fabulous and she should be happy. Instead she falls for this handsome sexy guy across the street. I contend that there is another way to look at this film. Lou wore shorts a lot in this film. Daniel never wore shorts once, in fact the director made sure we got to see his Capri pants, they were always long pants; even at the beach. Margot never cooks in the whole film; in fact she hates the kitchen. The opening and closing montage style is completely different from the rest of the film. It is an intimate dance with Margot, the close ups of her bare feet moving gracefully. Throughout the film she wears funky sneakers, rarely barefoot. The opening and closing montage say that the affair was a fantasy. If I look back on the film with the idea that the affair was completely in Margot's head, the film takes on a completely different amazing turn. It all makes sense and is powerful.<br /><br />The film is beautifully made. The interiors are full of stuff, bright colored stuff. Margot wears some of the funkiest unusual clothes. The exteriors portray a Toronto neighborhood so perfectly, open and green. The trips into the city are tight shots with all kinds of activity everywhere. Michelle Williams is absolutely radiant. She is bohemian, wears those unusual clothes perfectly. She as well as Sarah Silverman are never afraid to take off her clothes. They are both beautiful women comfortable with their bodies. Seth Rogan and Luke Kirby are also confident, but both stand to the side to let the women shine. This is a strong cast. I do have one complaint about the Montreal airport, it is not Dorval - the chairs, halls, and doors are all wrong. Given the attention to detail in this film, I'm surprised that slipped in.<br /><br />The film is almost two hours long. It does move along at about the same slow pace throughout. Frankly, I liked this pace. This isn't an action picture; it is a sort of romance or a slow slide into a fantasy world. I would guess it was too slow for a lot of viewers. This is an R rated film. There are several scenes with full frontal and rear female nudity. There is a scene in the middle of the film where Daniel describes what he wants to do to Margot. It is one of the most sensual scenes I have ever watched where nobody ever took off their clothes or even touched. There is an artistic scene of two people having sex, reasonably well covered. There is some strong language. The film is intended for mature audiences.<br /><br />This film was less about betrayal and more about what boredom and fantasy willlead people to think. I loved the quirkiness of this film. The soundtrack was perfection. Sarah Silverman and Michelle Williams were amazing. Although slow moving, I was moved by this film.lead people to think.

B000WD66BM|5.0|I believe some of the other reviews have given a history of the group, Nightwish, and also of this album, so I won't retell what has already been told.<br /><br />I am a very new convert to symphonic metal, having first heard it played on a bus I was riding and, having listened to several other bands in the genre, I realized that Nightwish is far, far above the competition, and Oceanborn is an amazing example! The songs are beautiful, the tone is joyful, and the melodies are unforgettable! I find myself humming them at the oddest times. :) Be sure to read the lyrics as I think you'll be surprised at the lovely thoughts expressed.<br /><br />You certainly don't need to be a fan of metal to appreciate Nightwish's creations. My 88-year-old mother thinks many of their songs are terrific, and so do my 6, 4-1/2 and 2-1/2 year-old granddaughters, as well as their parents!!!
1419705849|5.0|That was Christmas gift for my nephew, and he love it. It is hard cover which is better. Thank you!
B007STBUIW|5.0|I got this one shortly after It came out on the market, My Dvd copy of it was pretty good,but the Surround sound, or 5.1 dolby surround hade very little punch to it, hardly any efects at all in the rear channels, Right away you could tell the difference,  It hade excellent Surround effects in all Channels, The picture was quit Inproved as well This is one case where the Blueray really was an Inprovement over the DVD, If you like JAWS,  get this one...
B00A4TKDKY|3.0|Buddy Guy is one of Chicago blues' most electric performers.  When he is on, his live sets crackle with energy and excitement.  So naturally, a new Buddy Guy album titled \\"Live at Legends\\" caught my attention.<br /><br />The main problem with \\"Live at Legends\\" is that there's not nearly enough of the \\"live\\" promised in the title.  The live portion of this disc only amounts to seven tracks for a little over 30 minutes of music, two of those tracks being montages of Buddy impersonating Cream and Hendrix.<br /><br />The disc is rounded out by three studio tracks left over from the \\"Living Proof\\" sessions.  \\"Living Proof\\" was a great album, and these tracks could hardly be considered luke warm leftovers.  \\"Polka Dot Love,\\" \\"Coming For You\\" and \\"Country Boy\\" are all great Buddy Guy tracks, full of rip-snorting guitar work and Guy's trademark vitality.  But again, three studio tracks hardly a great album makes.<br /><br />\\"Live at Legends\\" splits the difference between being a true live album and a collection of unreleased studio rarities, and doesn't do either in a totally satisfying manner.  A \\"live\\" album that is made up of nearly half studio recordings cannot truthfully be called a \\"live\\" album, and the studio tracks can only be considered filler to round out the dearth of live material.<br /><br />What little live material is here is fun, however.  \\"Best Damn Fool,\\" \\"Mannish Boy\\" and \\"Damn Right, I've Got the Blues\\" absolutely smoke with Buddy Guy's fiery guitar and impassioned vocals.  It just makes it that much more disappointing when the fun is over after only half an hour.<br /><br />I wish I could give \\"Live at Legends\\" a heartier vote of confidence, but in all honesty, it's an uneven hodgepodge of an album.  The live material is fun but scant, and the studio tracks are Grade A Buddy Guy, but feel like filler after the few live tracks.  Buddy Guy fans will want to pick it up, because it IS a new Buddy Guy record after all, and there's nothing here that they wouldn't like.  But casual fans can find a better variety of live Buddy Guy and studio tracks on other albums.<br /><br />\\"Live at Legends\\" gives a promising taste, but leaves you feeling like a great latter day Buddy Guy live album has still yet to be made.

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game is one of the best games I've played in a VERY long time. Once you get into it though, it just stops. To continue, you must pay $3. Now that I ran out of my gift card money(which I had when I originally got the game) I'd rather have a game that costs money right off the bat rather than having my hopes and dreams crushed!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I haven't seen Season 3 yet but I did watch Seasons 1 & 2 on Amazon which was great!  The show is wonderful and renewed my love of GB.  A perfect timing with all the great things going on there with the Royal family and Olympics.  This show reminds me of what great tv used to be like!  It is reminds me of old mini-series like North and South, Roots, etc.  The Scarlet Pimpernel staring Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews (1982) was my favorite show since it first aired and I still love it.  This show reminds me of that show and wish AA was part of the cast.  He'd be a great addition.

B000GUJYRE|5.0|I am a big fan of the Karajan's 70s cycle. It is one of those recordings that I could have never imagined that could be surpassed. Not even the cycle that he recorded later in the 80s (or earlier in the 60s) is a match.<br /><br />The story starts when I got in my car and turned on the radio. It was the second movement of the seventh. The seventh is exactly the main reason that the Karajan's 70s set could not be transcended. That recording is so fresh and so well played that it was impossible that another seventh would ever impact me.<br /><br />But that seventh on the radio caught my attention. The first thing that I noticed was the sound quality. It was earthy. I could smell the Vienna that Beethoven grew up. I detected nuances and details that were totally new to me. The orchestra was quite agile, adjusting itself to each climax with outstanding expertise. The strings, woods, percussion, all elements blended extremely well and with so much confidence that I could not believe my ears. \\"What orchestra is that?\\" \\"Who is conducting this?\\", I kept asking myself? I arrived at my destiny 5 minutes before the end and I waited in the car for the announcer to solve the mystery. And the answer came: Bernard Haitink and the London Symphony Orchestra! WHAT??? BERNARD HAITINK???<br /><br />I confess that I don't much about Bernard Haitink. Until that day, the only recording I own from him is Shostakovich 11th, which by the way is unbelievable good. But that seventh on the radio was Haitink's Beethoven? It didn't make any sense. I browsed the reviews here and I saw right away that most of opinions coincided with mine (taking into account that I just heard about half of the seventh). I bought the set and that made me rediscover Beethoven. All symphonies are wonderfully played. I don't think I need to go one by one. As someone wrote here, I felt that I was listening to these symphonies for the first time.<br /><br />This set also has the best recording of the triple concerto andLeonore #2 that I've ever heard.<br /><br />The Karajan set is still there. I hope that I didn't become immune to that one. Eventually I will try it again.<br /><br />One more thing: I recently heard on the radio (always the radio) another Beethoven recording that made me wonder. It was the 8th. Once again, I waited to see who was responsible for that one. It was Zinman. I understand that he and Haitink used the same edition. A lot has been happening with these symphonies for the last 20 years. Maybe one day I will try the Zinman set. For now, I can't imagine that the Haitink and LSO set can be surpassed...

B00A80SHFM|5.0|We really enjoyed the movie.  The only low point was Russell Crowe's acting or lack thereof, so hearing the voices alone eliminates that problem.  Congrats to Dennis Hopper for encouraging the actors to sing with their emotions.  Hugh Jackman, of course, is great.  Anne Hathaway and Eddie Redmayne - such pleasant surprises.  Great purchase for musical soundtrack lovers.
