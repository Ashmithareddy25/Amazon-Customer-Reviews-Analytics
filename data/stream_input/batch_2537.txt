B008XG1X18|5.0|When I first joined Pinterest it was mainly out of curiosity because I had seen other people I know had it, so I joined. Now I'm hooked!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is very fun because it has a subway tunnel and a crystal cave and more than the other temple run. that's not all. it is very adventurey and there is no violence. it also has a waterfall.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Love this game it was so much fun you should really play this game you will like it so if you
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have been a faithful Sookie Stackhouse fan and have read every book. I was very pleased with how the series ended.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|a lot of fun and the accuracy of the suits its awesome. great game and since its free its even better!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I laughed AND I cried.  So very well done.  I could see the characters and feel real emotions.  I couldn't put it down!
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I have a kindle fire HD and it doesn't work for it. It says it's downloaded but then you can't use it.
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|Awesome almost like tf2 and i like how you unlock items and classes as you level up. I like the look of the game and the handling of the controls.<br />The run button is good so is the mini map.<br />All it needs is bigger maps and vehicles.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|My husband and I have very much enjoyed watching The Good Wife.  The storyline is interesting and It has some unexpected twists and turns.  The actors/actresses are appealing.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|No great insights but a nice relaxing way to spend some financing out about the life of a funny person.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|I found at times that I loved it and could not put it down. But, as we retreated in time, I found myself losing interest. So in the end, not a great read for me despite an amazing and diverse voice.
B0084IRI9G|5.0|Loved the book! I just got a puppy and was reading this book. I cried through the whole thing. So touching and heart warming...but, like all dog books...sad ending. Well written and grabbed my attention. I read it in 2 days.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|Outstanding, hard not watch the next episode. I stopped watching Lost when it aired on TV because I could not keep up with it. That is not a problem viewing it this way.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|Found this fun but frustrating.  Don't like the pop ups. A child had some problems completing.  Probably need to be over six to find way through the games. .
B007OWRBJK|3.0|Homes, Dogs, Boats, Clothes, Shoes, TVs, Tape Recorders, Studio gadgets, Cars, Drinks, Drugs, Books, Guitars, Keyboards, Psychologists, More Homes, More Boats. I have never read the words \\" I bought \\" so many times. If Pete sees this, I figure he's on Amazon - buying something.
B00701QVVY|5.0|Have to be honest here. I have never really listened Overkill. Over the last thirty years it has mostly been Bay Area thrash for me.  But I kept seeing Overkill putting out album after album and they are revered by a lot musicians and critics alike. Yes The Electric Age is awesome and I cannot believe I haven't been listening to these guys. Come and Get it, Electric Rattlesnake and Black Daze are balls to the wall and definitely showcase why these guys have lasted so long. Great album by some old school metal heads
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love the challege of trying to beat the time. I would suggest to anyone to buy this game to have fun with.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I saw this for the first time on tv a month or so ago and had to have it.  What a heart-warming story.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|As usual, Brandon Sanderson does not disappoint with his stories.  The magic system was very interesting.  The asian setting was also well done without being overdone.  I really liked the main character and would have loved to read more of her adventures.  It was a very well rounded story for a novella...I wish it was longer because I didn't want the book to end!
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I had looked forward to the release of this book and was very well pleased with the continuing saga of the Clifton family.  The ending leaves room for more story lines and I cannot wait for the next one.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|This is one movie I can watch over and over - it makes you cry but it also really makes you laugh
B00C061I3K|1.0|Don't know if I liked the last track because it was the last track, or if it was a glimmer of what I hoped the entire album would be. Don't get me wrong I could *probably* learn to like some of the tracks it just does not meet my expectations for a 'typical' daft punk style album.
B000068OCS|4.0|Ancient as I am (56), I first beheld this genre-bending film when it came out in 1983. It was shown in a small, alternative theater in Eugene, Oregon. This was when, in days of deep yore, one trekked to a location, sat with others, and saw a film. When the film's run was done it was gone. One could not put it into a device or view it on line. So, one tended to forget.<br /><br />Now thirty years later, with more degrees, more knowledge, and more weariness about life under the sun, I watched Koyaanisqatsi anew with a discerning young friend who is the same age as I was when I first watched it. This lends itself to some reflection.<br /><br />There is no narration, and voices only are heard as the credits run. The cinematography is everything and is impressive in its variety, depth, and scope. The theme is the relation of nature to culture, of the wild to the human and the domesticated, so to speak. We behold vistas of creation's grandeur and sublimity. The film begins very slowly with ulta-slow-motion footage of a rocket launch. Then scenes of dry mountains and deep ponds appear. These may have been present to juxtapose the permanent beauty of nature with the fleeting ugliness of man. However, what is the point of beauty if we blame the beholder for existing and trying to flourish? There are no scenes from forests or jungles or icecaps.<br /><br />Something is then blown up. A mountain falls--and we move into civilization, where humans touch nature. There is little emphasis on the achievements of man, but on his failures and miscalculations. All is overcrowded, much is ugly, workers are mere drones on assembly lines, and more.<br /><br />Hopi \\"prophecies\\" are shown at the end of the film, giving the viewer the idea that they knew. They knew what would be lost. They knew what would come...<br /><br />But these prophecies are quite vague and offer no hope. In this, the film is romantic about nature, forgetting about its redness in tooth and claw; in fact, animals are scarcely seen. Man is not measured by both his majesty and misery (Pascal), but by how he as despoiled nature. The film also neglects man's conservation of and concern for nature.<br /><br />The credits reveal that several social critics, such as the Christian sociologist, Jacques Ellul and the Catholic priest, Ivan Illich, have helped in inspire this documentary with no words. The score is by Phillip Glass, and is, of course, very repetitive, both in its slow scenes and in its speeded-up scenes of humans driving and bustling about. This waxes cloying after a few moments.<br /><br />The technology, which is generally vilified in this film, is, to the contemporary eye, rather antiquated. People play huge, public video games, such as Pacman. They stare at bulky and non-digitized television sets. There is not a laptop or cell phone in sight. Thus, the gap, as it were, between nature and culture has widened. Have we become \\"tools of our tools,\\" as Thoreau said?carcely seen.

B008RTE09S|5.0|Finally out on Blu Ray, Magical Mystery Tour is one the Beatles' weirdest and nonsensical films released.  Great songs provide a backdrop to a drunken (and stoned) bus ride through the English countryside.  Bizarre and dreamy, this film cannot be missed by Beatles fans, but others should know they'll likely get little outside of the fantastic soundtrack and a few interesting visuals.
B00CW665VI|4.0|This book was really good.  I love the male POV.  There were some parts that actually had me laughing out loud.  I don't really see the need for a second book, but I read that it will be from the female POV.  I may get it, but it really isn't necessary.  This book was great on its own.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I became a captive audience as each phase unfolded. Brilliant. This book was a recommended read by a friend. Glad I took the challenge.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|...you absolutely love this CD. An all star cast that makes the impact of the music even more intimate and emotional.
B000I8HIR2|3.0|This film version of the game sets fans up early with a few shot-for-shot remakes of scenes from the game.  The story, settings, characters and actions (sometimes to a fault, see map scene) all mirror the game pretty closely, but the added questionable ending make the film it's own.  Recommended for fans of the game or pretty good horror.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|In perfect condition, fast shipping.  These utecils are wonderful to use, they stay above the surface when they are laid down.  Keeps working area clean.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|A light interesting read with a few passages of literary brilliance which do not compare to previous works. However, her attention to detail and use of in depth research give the reader interesting insights into a previously unknow industry in the area!!
B0067EKYS6|5.0|Throughout the movie I was getting myself ready for the 1929 stock market crash.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire (once you pass the stage of his Spiderman role) were both excellent in their parts.<br /><br />I would give Tobey Maguire the edge, he carried the movie from beginning to end.<br /><br />Despondent Nick Carroway brings to us his perspective and experiences with \\"The Great Gatsby\\".  How and why the friendship began and grew in understanding.<br /><br />In the end the love of two human beings forever en-grained in your heart.
B007C94QRK|5.0|&#34;Menomena!&#34;<br />The Muppets is one of the most enjoyable and soon-to-be-classic musicals available. Both Jason Segel & Amy Adams act up the cuteness just enough to be not sickeningly sweet and instead provide characters the audience can believe in surrounded by the lovable Muppets.  Kermit and the gang make a long-overdue return to the screen in top form.  The film's entire premise being the setup of The Muppets grand return from obscurity only adds to the humor and self-aware charm of the movie.  HIGHLY recommended for the entire family.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Best Adam Sandler movie.  My kid loves this movie and is not scared of any of it. I even enjoy it from time to time.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|My husband read this book in two days and has a whole new outlook on death and heaven.  As a physician also he has discussed the book and recommended it to several colleagues to see what they think about the book and Dr. Alexander's journey.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Definitely worth buying. Though it ended a little abruptly, it was super fun and challenging at the same time. I think anyone can enjoy this wonderfully put together game. :)
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Liam Neeson makes for a really great action star as he hunts down the men who kidnapped his daughter.  The capture scene being a creepy, but thrilling highlight.  The pace rarely lets up and by the end I was frothing to see the sequel.  Recommended for action fans and especially Neeson fans.
B004X75RK4|4.0|Betty White is awesome and I enjoy this movie every now and then.  Certainly not a classic but it's funny.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|When I don't have my kindle or my ipad, I always have my phone to read. App syncs & works well.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|The Alchemist is a tale written in a simple context and indulges in fables and religious teachings to depict various lessons one needs to surpass life. The author, Paulo Coelho, writes the simple story in the way of a fable and teaches both the reader and the protagonist the joy of following one's dream despite the odds. Coelho brings wisdom in its simplest form to light through the usage of the setbacks faced by Santiago, a young Andalusia shepherd boy who leaves his flock of sheep in search of his Personal Legend and becoming rich.<br />Upon being inspired by a Gypsy woman and an old man who states that he is the king of Salem to follow his dream and the omens God sent for him to follow, Santiago leaves his hometown in Spain and sets off to the Egyptian pyramids to claim his treasure. Along his journey, Santiago encounters omens, thieves, a camel driver, an Englishman following his own Personal Legend to become an alchemist, Fatima, the love of his life and an alchemist, all of whom point him into the directions his treasure. The hindrances Santiago faces leads both the reader and Santiago to believe that such treasure does not exist, thus Santiago would never achieve his dream/Personal Legend. With the aid of the alchemist, Santiago is able to understand and experience how everything has a soul and all is one, and discovering himself along the process. That leaves all to believe that that was the real treasure that Santiago was to discover, but was it?
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Season 3 definitely picked up the pace some, introduced new characters/locations and saw the loss of other major characters.<br />Amazon Player on PS3 was a simple way to get caught up on missed episodes.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|This movie is well made and fun to watch.  Can't wait for the next ones to come out.  If you enjoy this story I strongly suggest reading the original &#34;the hobbit&#34; by j.r. Tolkien.
0553573403|4.0|I watch the show of course and now that the season is about to end I dedcided to start on the books. I haven't been able to read too much just yet, but I like it so far. The seller was an excellent choice. I'll keep them in mind when I'm ready for book 2.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|This book was a little slow to start, but having seen the Tv series I expected a quicker  pace I suppose. However, I enjoyed learning more about each character and seeing the story from different perspectives. I'm looking forward to the next one already!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|First, I am a dog owner.  Is owning a dog a prerequisite to enjoying this book?  Not necessarily, but I think I derived some of my enjoyment from assigning some of the thought processes of the main protagonist to my own dog.<br /><br />There are moments where the connection to racing seems a little stretched and where the story tries too hard to grasp the reader's heartstrings but, overall, it was worth reading.  I would recommend this book to someone who owns a quiet, loyal dog.
B00BSBXA98|4.0|I wasn't totally sure what to expect but I'll say that I was entertained during the whole thing. Gives you a taste of what those performers can do at those big shows at the price of a few dollars.
B0013ISU0A|5.0|A longtime REM fan, I have to admit I originally purchased this when it came out new and kind of shelved it after a couple listens.  Not enthused with much new out there in 2013 I pulled this and a couple other CD's I had mostly ignored from a few years ago.  This time around this really struck me as a great album and an under appreciated REM effort.  I don't know why it escaped me a few years ago, perhaps it was the single 'Supernatural Superserious' which didn't thrill me at the time or some of their other later efforts which were hit and miss.  But this stands above those and rivals the releases of their hayday.  I really think 'Houston', 'Until the Day is Done', and 'Mr Richards' are among the strongest tracks of their wonderful career and there is not a track I feel compelled to skip over.  Some of Michael's best vocal work ever is here on the Hollow Man track, which with it's hard edged guitar is probably my favorite track.  It's like getting a new release for me, but I really recommend it.
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|Acting was a little stilted, but this was her first film after being an MMA fighter.  Even my husband and son loved the fight scenes.  Love to see a truly strong female character.  Realistic portral of living life as a spy, not the cheesy &#34;Mr & Mrs Smith&#34; version.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Silver Linings was recommended to me by a friend. It was funny and sad at the same time. I would definitely suggest it to anyone!
B00BJS7104|5.0|This is a great movie. It's a bit graphic. If you are a Quintin Terintino fan I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|Movie had some funny moments, but overall the subject matter was handled in a depressing manner, with stereotyped, unlikable characters.<br /><br />Knocked Up was terrific, this one fell short.
B008BU75IQ|2.0|The series was much better  than this book.  The plot is lame.  The coincidences, characters and outcomes are simply beyond credible.  archer is such a good writer but  he's lost his way on this one
B00B69UQEO|3.0|As a Depeche Mode fan for 27 years, I thought each album since Black Celebration was better than the previous... until now.  I tried several times to listen to the entire album and have my opinion changed but I just have a hard time ranking this above 3 stars.  Sounds like an experiment and DM has always evolved their style, I just don't like where this one ended up.  This kills me to say anything negative about my favorite group, but they may have rushed into this a bit.  I'l go back to previous albums to get my Depeche fill.
B008YI91HS|5.0|This movie is always good to watch. Unfortunately it was the only good Jurassic park made. Dinosaurs are cool, science is cool.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Loved the movie, great story, great acting, action sequence in the raid on Bin Laden's compound was intense and compelling.
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|I like to ply blokus and find this game to be just as challenging as the board game.  Lots of fun.
B009D5VNLS|4.0|My Daughter loves this movie and it's &#34;princess&#34; star character.  Good story, cute movie and very entertaining the whole way through.
B0060CXAHC|5.0|The kid and I love watching this movie. Which is good because she wants to watch it every day over and over.  It will always be a favorite.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|has a twist you will not see coming, heartwarming I would put it up there with the notebook, walk in the clouds etc. check it out
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was in a word \\"Awesome\\".  What can you say about Drew? He is funny, sexy, honest, sweet...I could go on and on.  I loved him.  The author did a wonderful job of creating a main character with a multifaceted and colorful personality.  Drew's observations about people in general and men in particular were spot on.  I highly recommend this book!  A definite MUST READ!
B00A7W29BE|1.0|With Google Docs this application is of little value. This does little more than take a picture of a document.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|The kid and I love watching this movie. Which is good because she wants to watch it every day over and over.  It will always be a favorite.
B00BS4QP60|4.0|only complaint is that there are too many ballads...could use some more up beat songs.<br />that's a small complaint; if you like Blake you'll like this.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Just when you think you know what is going to happen, the plot turns and twists into a satisfying mind intriguing finish.<br />excellent acting. Important topics.
B00CS65JS2|3.0|A definite fall from grace.  A semi-mediocre album with nothing much to write home about.  A departure from their usual deep bass and addictive rhythms.  This throw back salute to the 70's is nothing short of boredom personified.  Unremarkable, uninspired, easily forgettable, in short a complete let down given their past performances on previous albums.<br />I had expected more but after listening to the entirety of the cd (borrowed not bought), it was just a turmoil in trying something new and falling completely flat on its face.<br /><br />In summary, I find absolutely none of this album entertaining in anyway.  A waste of money.
B0051XSKSU|5.0|My kid and I love watching this movie. It has excellent humor and it keeps my kid entertained while I tried to get some stuff done.
0061537969|5.0|A friend told me about this book and I bought it for another friend for Christmas since she is an animal lover.  I borrowed it from her to read and have really enjoyed the story, even though it is sad.  It is written an if the dog is writing and talking, so cute.
0307155102|5.0|This book is chock full of interesting things to look at. In typical word book fashion, each two-page spread has a theme, such as home, farm, boats, jobs, etc. But it also has little side stories and comments scattered about (with familiar Richard Scarry characters) that make it more that just a book full of themed words. Also, the front flap illustrates the alphabet and the back flap counts from one to twenty with, for example, five ducks (or whatever) after the number 5. It's great for teaching the meaning of numbers.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Great product for the price!!!!  If you want a  ready/web browser at a great price then this is for you.
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|This was really well done and even though I'm not in to musicals it kept me entertained throughout the whole movie.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Welcome to the world of magic, illusions, and a story spun around mystifiying events much like Myrlin from King Arthur. The tangled web of mind games between the characters will keep the reader trying to stay one step ahead of where Sanderson is trying to take them.
0394826817|5.0|Loved it then, love it now. It's cute, charming, funny, and endearing. It is a collection of shorter stories. If you use the &#34;Look Inside this Book&#34; feature, you can see for yourself exactly what I mean. But you'll have to buy the book to find out what happens to Pig Won't.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a page turner! If you're looking for a book where you'll never be able to predict the end then this is it!
B005ZMV2EQ|5.0|The kid and I love watching this movie. Which is good because she wants to watch it every day over and over.  It will always be a favorite.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|You can't help but to fall in love with the main characters in this book.  Very hard to read the hardships these poor orphans had to endure, but so rewarding at the end.
B005USZYDU|5.0|This series was new to me but still very interesting. Can,t wait to start on the next one and see what Theo is up to this time!
B003B17YZE|5.0|This is the last studio release by the Jimi Hendrix Experience and is filled with various styles of awesomeness. It's got guest appearances from Jack Cassidy and Steve Winwood.....what else do you need to know? Jump on it!
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Kid really enjoys it.  It has good humor that can keep adults entertained also. I recommend this movie to everyone.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I bought this a year ago when I put my computer together and it's still running strong. No overheating, no mess, no fuss, exactly what you'd hope for. The installation was easy due to its design and it had a bit more than what was needed. I appreciated the extra just-in-case insurance.
B0058SNNK8|5.0|I ordered these in pink after purchasing a black pair because they are so comfortable.  I love that they are a bit more feminine and less clunky looking than traditional crocs.  So, so comfy!
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|This is such a beautiful soundtrack! I listen to if often and it really is one of my all time favorites:)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is so awesome I can play it all day I really want the Hawaii one I bet it is better
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I've only had the app for a few days now but so far it seems to work fine on my galaxy s4
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This game has just enough scary things and good fun. I am definitely looking forward to a sequel. I love it.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I have not read the book, but the movie was very entertaining.  I truly enjoyed the movie--According to my wife, I looked pretty intense
B005LAIIKI|4.0|Fully aware of what this movie entailed, my expectations for this movie were high. You can say they were \\"Unchained\\". For a nearly three-hour motion picture, it kept me consistently entertained. Sure there were some slow spots, but what followed was either a great exchange of dialogue and/or a grand-scale scene of hilariously graphic violence (both are trademarks of Tarentino). Django's character may not be as engaging as one would hope, but the characters surrounding him are engaging to the point where Django is uniformly identified with them. Christoph Waltz is fantastic, but Samuel L. Jackson steals the movie! This movie is definitely not for everyone. Certain viewers will be offended by stereotypes portrayed on screen, and the language is certainly vile in addition to the violence. That being said, pop this sucker in and be prepared to be entertained!
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|It was nice to purchase the movie and be able to watch it right then. It was a cute movie.
B0093CNZ5I|5.0|Entertaining, emotional, funny and moral living issues brought up for discussion.  Thank you for having it available for streaming.  Gina
B002LFAHBO|5.0|I am a very skeptical viewer and can find fault with even the most intricate of plots. What most people love, I find ridiculously flawed.<br />This film, however, which I first saw about 7 years ago, is, among other things, the perfect response to 9/11.<br />The message is undeniable and renewing: love is actually all around us.<br />Is it schmaltzy, weighty, campy, oozy, dumb, corny, and overly ambitious? Yes, it is. So are people, so is life.<br />But this film attempts, as few modern films to, to propose a theory and then go about hamhandedly proving its validity.<br />And it works. A child develops a crush on a young girl who has the same name as his recently deceased mother. He has no awareness of the connection, of his need to heal. He winds up running past security in an AIRPORT to tell her he loves her and goodbye. What a sweet, heartbreaking, heartwarming antidote that moment alone represented to the hatred of the terrorist attacks.<br />And that's just one vignette. There are many others, all of which take us through the nuances and complications of romance and relationships and friendship in ways that are not just amusing but also undeniable genuine and sincere.<br /><br />People who don't like this film are judging it as a film. As such, it is monumentally flawed. As a message of hope and as \\"a reminder of all that was once good in the world, and could be again\\" it is perfect.<br />At a time when hate seems so obviously prevalent and persistent, what's wrong with a little Christmas counterargument?<br /><br />Let's get pissed and watch porn.
B002N83GYE|3.0|Before Walter Isaacson's epic Steve Jobs biography there was nothing official about Job's life, it was just a lot of books trying to deconstruct his life and figure him out.  Job's had always avoided media exposure of his personal life into the public and this surrounded him with a halo of mystery that fascinated everyone.  That is why every single hint of his personality created and will keep creating for decades great curiosity on his life and way of thinking.  Inside Steve's Brain is a book that pretends to construct the puzzle of Steve Jobs from a more psychological perspective based from Job's quotes on press and magazine articles to interviews found all over the web.  The author does a great Job into deconstructing Job's personality from the bits and pieces available at the time and gives the Apple fan more reasons to love the brand.  However once you read Isaacson's biography you realize that most of what you read about Job's was loosely right and accurate.  You cannot beat first hand recount of someones life when reading a biography.<br /><br />This is a book I believe had great value before Isaacson's biography, but currently it's value is more entertaining than accurate in terms of getting into more details of Steve Job's personality.  If you are a Job's fan and want to get into a different perspective of Job's I can recommend this book!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I saw this movie both at the cinemas and now at home.  It never fails to deliver.  The story is brilliant and history filled.  I really loved the story told by all actors who played their individual roles brilliantly.  For those who don't have access to a theatre, such as I, then I highly recommend this movie.  It will not disappoint.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is super addictive...love playing it..just waiting to update so it is in Miami like on my smartphone..awesomeness..you should definitely play this game
B008OM0EDO|3.0|Just watched this movie for free with Amazon Prime.  While it did have a few funny moments, overall it just wasn't very good, and at only about 1 hour and 13 minutes (not including the credits), it's barely a movie.  Unlike Borat and Bruno, this is not a character you will care about or even remember once it's over.
B008CFN95I|4.0|Loved the book. Fun to follow the clues and realise I was clueless!<br />An engrossing tale well written and satisfying.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is awesome and highly recommended. This should be watched by every young man and be in every home. It has drama, action, tender moments and challenges the heart of every male who wants to live his life and rear his children to know and live their life for the Lord.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|This is a very nice case.  I like that the power shuts off when you close it, and (unlike other reviewers) I have no problem charging it when it's closed. To me, it's just a simple matter of moving the elastic strap, so I don't really understand why this is an issue to some people.  My only complaint is the nearly $30 price tag when most cases like this sell for $10-$15 less.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I was looking forward to reading this book, as the last in the Sookie Stackhouse series, and I could not have been more disappointed.  Sookie seems to come full circle and is right back where we found her in book 1 with Sam.  The romance seemed forced, like Sookie was ending with Sam against her will.  Sookie also seems to have taken a turn down oblivious road in the last few books.  Not seeming to pick up on anybody's clues or hints.  Her character has grown stronger in the sense &#34;I can kill someone and bury them in my woods without much of a second thought&#34; sort of way, but her intelligence level, or people (super?) skills, have gone way down.  All in all, this was my least favorite book that Charlaine Harris has written in the series and I wished she would have let Sookie's story flow more naturally instead of forcing it into a disappointing end.
B009NY43NY|1.0|**Spoiler**  This series was flat and led nowhere! It was also missing the key male characters: Eric, Bill, Alcide. They were only in the book a handful of times. The ending was very rushed, and Sookie ended up with Sam. There was never really any chemistry between these two characters. How could she mess up such a great series?! I don't understand it! Why have us fall in love with the complex male character, Eric, then to write him out of the final book almost completely?!!
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|This is the first novel that has kept my first grader interested enough that he read the whole thing himself.  He's now on book 4, less than a month later.  A couple of his friends are reading them and it gives them motivation and something to discuss.  I know they are intended for slightly older children so some of the material can be slightly inappropriate.  But as long as it's not harmful to him, I'm willing to let him read whatever interests him.  He loves to tell me about what is happening and things he finds funny.
B00CW665VI|5.0|OMG!  Or should I say Oh My Drew!  I absolutely fell in love with this book and couldn't put it down.  Extremely well-written, each character brought something terrific to the storyline - which was completely entertaining  and thought-out from beginning to end.  And where should I start with Drew?  He is my new favorite leading man. Sexy, smart, funny, family-oriented, and talented in EVERY way!<br />Reading this story completely from his point of view was such an unexpected treat. It was hysterically funny, refreshingly honest, and I just loved it!  Are these really the things going through the male mind?  I think they really are!  And why would Drew lie to us? The witty banter back and forth between the characters and bonds displayed between the friends and family members were just great.  Miss Chase is brilliant and I am so excited to devour more of her books in the future.  An absolute MUST read tale of romance, hysterical truths, and hot,hot sex!  Definitely more than 5 Stars!!!

B00006CXSS|4.0|I purchased this series as a gift for my adult son. He was enthralled by it when he first saw some of the exploits on HBO. He watched it and raved about it until I was finally allowed to &#34;borrow&#34; it and judge for myself. I will have to admit it is a spell-binding series to sit through. I have developed an affinity for &#34;action&#34; movies and &#34;war&#34; movies and this series does not disappoint. I thought &#34;Schindler's List&#34; was great in its time...and still think so. &#34;Saving Private Ryan&#34; was another favorite and I still believe it is one of the best war movies of all time. So, where does &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; fit into this heirarchy?? It is hard for me to say exactly. I have developed sort of a love/hate relationship with it. I use that term (love/hate..) to describe the emotional turmoil I feel, not my feelings toward the project!! In the first place, how do you compare a made for TV mini-series with a wide screen cinematic event? It is difficult at best because the portrayal of Easy Company takes place over ten to twelve hours allowing the viewer time to assimilate the story and to develop bonds with the characters that simply cannot take place in a two to three hour cinematic portrayal. For that reason I believe that &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; reaches into areas and touches virgin ground in its portrayal of the intricacies of war. Does that mean that a mini-series is a better venue than a feature film?? Not always, but maybe in this particular situation it is.<br /><br />So, if this project is so good, why only four stars..?? That's a good question and I am not certain that I can answer it. When you watch something this BIG, you expect BIG. You expect big plot lines and big characters. You expect big sets and big cinematography and big sequences. You expect big dialog and big action. And you expect your characters to display big emotion and demand a lot of empathy. And, for the most part, this series delivers all of that. I just wonder if it's really as good as I think it is.<br /><br />The main characters are well developed. I especially appreciate the efforts of Winston, Nixon, and Speirs. These characters lead the procession of Easy Company across France and Germany and along with many others form the nucleus around which the series revolves. There are many other characters who figure prominently in the series and are present in almost every episode. I haven't counted characters and episodes so I don't know for certain, but it seems like there are a lot of the same characters portrayed. This would make sense, both from a producer/director standpoint and from the standpoint of a real life military combat unit. Except in cases of extreme casualty losses, units tend to stay together and new or different faces are not too frequent. I think that the extended casting necessary for a project of this size is part of my reluctance to admit that this effort is in fact the &#34;best&#34; and worthy of that rating. I think it is impossible to fully develop all of those characters...yet I would like to see that happen. I don't know, it's probably just me!!<br /><br />In any event, this series, &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; is too well done and too grand to miss. As a war portrayal it covers events in a way never before seen and goes into detail never before attempted. I think it is important to remember the touchstone phrase &#34;suspension of disbelief&#34; because we are dealing with a man-made portrayal of a particular series of events that actually happened. And while not one hundred percent accurate to recorded history, it is very close. And &#34;very close&#34; in this case means an ALMOST perfect portrayal. Don't miss this one!!st wonder if it's really as good as I think it is.<br /><br />The main characters are well developed. I especially appreciate the efforts of Winston, Nixon, and Speirs.

This book is a great read and I highly recommend it.

B009NY43NY|2.0|I have been a fan of the Sookie Stackhouse novels for years.  I waited anxiously, each year, for the next novel to come out.  I am completely disappointed about the change of direction that occurred in Dead Ever After.  I will admit, I am an Eric/Sookie person.  The last several books Charlaine spent building the character of Eric, and the relationship between he and Sookie.  NOWHERE, and at no time, was there the slightest inclination that Sookie would fall for Sam.  What's even worse than that, is that Sookie didn't even seem to be the least bit hurt over the ending of her relationship with Eric.  As if all of this wasn't enough, the author had to turn Eric into the bad guy in the very last book.  I personally feel like the only reason the author even wrote the last several books was because of the renewed interest in the books since True Blood.  I think Charlaine lost her passion for Sookie a long time ago, and that is a shame.

B000CNFC76|3.0|The film is an account of the amazing story about how a 20 year old, Francis Quimet, with a 10 year old caddy won the 1913 US Open gold tournament against the legendary British golfer, Harry vardon. The fl gets off to an unfortunate start with the first shot, entitled \\"Jersey - England - 1897\\". Jersey is not, and never has been, part of England or indeeed of the United Kingdom. It is one of the Channel Islands and the head of state is Queen Elizabeth II in her right as Duke of Normandy. But maybe the producers or director assuemd that US audiences would be ignorant of this and for some reason pandered to this. However, it gets a lot better. The acting is generally excellent and the tension and disbelief that a golfer just out of his teens could pull of such an amazing success. It is the sort of story that appeals particularly to US audiences but also to most people. Harry Vardon is presented as a laconic - maybe a bit too laconic to do justice to his character, but a true sportsman, in contrast to the rather stereotyped snobbish British Lord Northcliffe. Shia Laboef makes a very credible Francis Quimet but as others have commented, his extraodrinary natural skill is hardly presented convincingly enough. Also, he won a number of state tournaments before the US Open, whereas the film portrays him as giving up golf after an early disappointment and then later leaving his job to go straight into the US Open. A sequence of his earlier successes would have added to the credibility. The film also, to its credit, does not downplay the class prejudice on the American side against a boy whose father was a labourer and who had to overcome and triumph over this. Indeed he shared such a modest background with his hero, Harry Vardon. His fiesty 10 year old caddy is somewhat over-sentimentalised, but overall an enjoyable and engaging film about the story that needed to be told.

B009UAO1ZG|4.0|I've never read anything by Olson, and I was unfamiliar with this time period, but I highly recommend Those Angry Days. She does a great job of explaining the political/social divides of the time. I credit her with being as fair to both sides-- as any good historian should. Frequently, she mentions instances of the pro-war side using vicious and incendiary rhetoric. Even though they were right, the reader will recoil from some of their rhetoric.  The book's two huge rivals, Lindbergh and FDR, are portrayed not as either supermen or villains, but as flawed human beings with good intentions rallying their cause. This is one of the best works of history in the last few years.<br /><br />Small quibble: when discussing Lindbergh's comparison to Clement Vallandigham, the antiwar politician during the Civil War, she refers to him as a Senator. He was a Congressman and a candidate for governor, not a senator. (Admittedly this seems trivial, but I believe historians should be held to a very high standard of historical accuracy.)

We are both fairly intelligent people ans still after the movie is over - we do not know what is was about.  I am just glad we did not spend $50 at the theater to see this one.<br />Too bad - figured it would be good since Tom Hanks was in it.

B003VANOFY|1.0|pros:  Sound quality is amazing. I would say I have never get immersed in a game before try this phone.  External noise Isolation  is amazing.  Mic muting by moving the mic up is amazing.  volume control is very good.    cons: (not exactly cons)  3D sound direction is not 100% clear.  voice morphing is not so good (but it is the less important feature for me)  Do not have a P2 adapter    It is very sensitive to interference, because of that it turns off/on each 3 seconds or get a noise each second. For that reason I simple throw this headset on trash.

0307744434|4.0|Every once in a while I'll want to read a book due to its cover alone, and The Night Circus is one such book.  I just love the red, black, and silver colors coupled with the silhouettes.  Then, when I read the plot description on the back, it seemed all the more enticing.  Morgenstern developed an incredible concept, one full of magic and imagination, and her writing is both sound and enjoyable.  But, though I very much enjoyed the majority of the book, in the end, The Night Circus lacked the climax for which I'd hoped.<br /><br />The plot is cool.  Very cool.  Two very old magicians wage war against each other, but the rules of combat will not allow them to touch one another.  Instead, they use pupils to exact their wishes.  One of them chose the boy who would eventually become Marco, and the other settled upon a girl named Celia.  The setting of the battle, unbeknownst to the performers, is The Night Circus, a place of mystery and wonder that appears unannounced and disappears just as quickly.  Marco and Celia are part of the circus, and as they duel with one another, they eventually begin to experience feelings, and these feelings complicate the conflict between the old men.  It is far more complex than that brief description, but, without revealing too much, that's basically it before the climax arrives.<br /><br />And that's where the book began to lose me a bit.  I tolerated the love story aspect of this book because Morgenstern's imagination is so admirable and the story well-executed.  The performances she created for the circus were outstanding, as were her supplemental characters.  A subplot in the book proved just as pleasurable as the main storyline, and really, everything worked well for me, until that climax arrived.<br /><br />For me, because the stakes had been set so high, I just didn't feel satisfied by the way events played out.  I didn't particularly care for the finale.  In the end, I'd say with all the set up, there just wasn't enough action or repercussions.<br /><br />Even with that being said, I still wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of imagination, magic, and good old romance.  However, if you're like me, just don't expect an action-packed ending.<br /><br />Scott William Foley, author of Souls Triumphantrepercussions.<br /><br />Even with that being said, I still wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of imagination, magic, and good old romance.

B00CW665VI|5.0|WOW!! Could this book get any better?! I don't think so! Emma Chase has done something amazing here.  My mind is completely blown.  She literally moved into a man's brain and wrote the best MALE POV book I've ever read.  Bravo Ms. Chase, your writing is brilliant. FLAWLESS.  I would love to pick your brain on how you came up with Drew's character and what type of research you did!! I bet we'd all learn some pretty interesting things... anyway... on to the review....<br /><br />Drew is your typical clean-shaven, good-looking, rich, expensive SUIT.  He lives a life of luxury - the extravagant NYC apartment, the fancy dinners, the amazing career, women falling at his feet, except, when we meet him... he is none of those things.  He has literally taken a nose dive into the deep end of life and caught THE FLU. Yep, the FLU.  In our world, this is simply called LOVE.  He has finally met the woman of his dreams and she ripped his heart right out of his chest... or did she?<br /><br />Drew's character is shameless.  He's hilarious, crude, rude, and sometimes (ok.. most of the time) a dick... and... I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT.  But you have to admire a man who can be brutally honest and still get so much love, right??  His honesty is what makes this book so perfect.  Drew's inner monologue seriously had me in stitches.  I think it might have been my favorite part of this book.  It also gave me some amazing insight into the male psyche.  It was mind blowing... and completely eye-opening... and it confirmed a lot of my suspicions about the male species in general.  All women should read this book and take notes. Seriously.<br /><br />Kate was also an awesome character.  I think she's one of the best-written female characters I've read lately.  She is strong-willed, witty, smart, confident, and has an incredible future laid out for herself.  She was pretty inspiring with how focused, devoted, and driven she was when it came to her career.  Drew and Kate were hilarious together.  I was literally laughing out loud through the entire book.  Their witty banter back and forth had me crying in parts because I was laughing so hard.  They also have a ridiculously intense chemistry that almost lit my kindle on fire.  It was HOT (I'm fanning myself right now just thinking about it!). And, on top of all that, the secondary characters in this book were equally as entertaining as Drew and Kate.  Mackenzie, Drew's 4-year-old niece, was the star of this book.  She stole the show!  She has some of the best scenes ever.  The Thanksgiving scene? OMG. I. WAS. DYING.  TOO FUNNY!  If you've already read this book, I'm sure you're giggling right now just thinking about it!

B000068QY7|4.0|July 2, 2002. 10 years and 11 months ago I bought this CD. How do I know that? This was the first and only time one of my favorite bands released a new album on my birthday.  And it happened twice, as \\"Oh Yeah\\" also came out that same day. As the church lady says, \\"Isn't that special\\".<br /><br />The first thing that stood out was that they wanted to look like the new U2. \\"Standing On The Shoulder of Giants\\" had a great album cover, but this time they must have wanted a sedate look, because If they had just colored the ceiling overhead they would have had a vibrant cover.<br /><br />When I first heard this I was driving and had the sound turned way down because I was eating. Driving. Eating. They don't call it fast food for nothing. After it was over I was thinking, \\"That's it?\\" It took a while to grow on me, probably because that first week I kept playing it at low levels. I think rock music needs to be played loud to be appreciated. At least until you get familiar with it. Once I put some headphones on and CRANKED IT I was able to hear what I was missing.<br /><br />When \\"Giants\\" was released in 2000, Oasis was a remade band, with two new guitarists, both of whom were more talented musicians than the original basement guitarist. \\"Giants\\" was a leaner, more eclectic and more mature album than \\"Be Here Now\\", and it took many fans by surprise. The band had grown up, the fans not so much.  With \\"Heathen\\", some of the rock songs veered back to the more simple days of party music. People wanted the old Oasis back, and in some ways with this release they got some of what they wanted.<br /><br />`The Hindu Times' starts us off at a high point, rocking out like the Oasis of old, with English guitar supposedly imitating Indian sitar. The title came from a t-shirt that may or may not have to do with the newspaper. But the idea was for it to be a spiritually uplifting song and it is surly one of the bands most optimistic lyrics ever. `Force Of Nature' is the opposite, as Noel gets pissed at his user woman and drives the hammer home in crunching chords. That one sounds awful personal. `Hung In A Bad Place' is the Victoria Secret song. It would have made a good band video. Gem shows he can write a quality Oasis tune, one as good as most any found on the first album. The songs down shifting screeching guitars end the trilogy of hard rockers that open the album.<br /><br />Even though `The Hindu Times' was a number one single, `Stop Crying Your Heart Out' which only reached number two, seems to be the most famous song on the album. Maybe because it is a traditional Oasis slow song. Or maybe because the chorus is so easy to remember and sing along to. Either way, these four songs represent what is great about Oasis.<br /><br />The mid section of the album is where it reaches its low point. `Little By Little' is not a bad song, but it is not as good as most of their other songs. Compared to their catalogue, it really seems like a B side. `A Quick Peep' on the other hand just seems like filler, as it never goes anywhere. It would have been better if it had been incorporated into a real song. `Idler's Dream', Noel's piano only piece, would have made the album much better. `All In The Mind' is a good song that does not seem to be given enough credit and it ties together the two tracks around it.<br /><br />There are two lovey dovey songs here that show a lighter side of Oasis. These of course are `She Is Love' and `Songbird', the albums sweet little romance songs. Like `Little James', `Songbird' shows that Liam can be a gentle singer. I find `She Is Love' to be a perfect little gem. It is acoustic guitar with organ and very slight percussion. This is Noel letting his heart out. Simple, elegant, beautiful.<br /><br />`Born on a Different Cloud' is Liam letting his Lennon out. It sounds like a lost Beatle epic. John strums an acoustic and sings about why he is not like everyone while George works the slide, Paul holds down the bass and Ringo pounds the skins. John and Paul add piano and organ, George a lead and all the boys sing along at the end, while Martin makes the whole thing sound like doom and gloom. One of the best Oasis tunes there is.<br /><br />`Better Man' is okay musically, but lyrically it just seems lazy, like the new \\"Be\\" tune, `Don't Bother Me'. I never listen to this last song, but as you have read, many a fan likes it. But I have recorded and listened to the last \\"last\\" song on the album many a time. Yes, these heathen chemist have left us a little surprise. In true `Her Majesty' fashion, when that last song ends, if you are paying attention, you will notice there is still like 31 minutes left on the CD. I did not notice this for days, because I always stopped the CD before the last track. If you play that track, when the song is over, the CD will play silence for about 29 minutes before all of a sudden a song will start. It is probably the most beautiful song they ever made. It sounds like your driving down a dark, lonely road at night. It may also be the most inappropriate name for a song ever. After the public became aware of the hidden song, the title of it was announced.<br /><br />`The Cage'.<br />Which is the last thing you should imagine when hearing it.<br /><br />So after all this time, I would rate \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" higher than \\"Be Here Now\\" and \\"The Masterplan\\", but I actually think all their other albums are better. This though is still the one I listen to the most while driving. Do yourself a favor and take a test drive on a dark road... and crank it up!s the skins.

B0095P33IW|5.0|I'm not sure why it took me so long to see this movie.  I'm glad I finally sat down and watched it.  Seeing it after the Avengers didn't really matter to me, the story was still enjoyable even though I knew what was going to happen in the end.
0385349831|5.0|a series of Qs adn As: addressing very fundamental topics that included, as examples:<br />1. about defeat<br />2. loyalty<br />3. whcih direct to take<br />4. too afraid to change<br />5. about miracles<br /><br />very innocent topics, but yet the 'teachings' so profound and spiritually apt.  man, I was blown away by the collection of wisdom, and if I could apply most of these principals,  I would be a much peaceful person navigating my lessons in this crazy world!  Great teachings in this small packaging of a book.  I had to read it slowly to savor the words, and no doubt I will be reading this book again.  A fan of Paul Coelho will not be disappointed with this book.  loved it.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|Nesbo's work was highly recommended to me by the Scandinavian Crime Fiction fans at GoodReads. I asked, Where should I start? Read THE SNOWMAN! was the universal suggestion. Then begin reading the rest of Nesbo's Harry Hole series in order. The Snowman was absolutely great from beginning to end, and I've ordered more Nesbo books on Kindle. And watched the film version of Nesbo's THE HEADHUNTERS on Netflix soon after beginning The Snowman - the best suspense film I've seen in years. Nesbo rocks!

Many helpful hints but mostly it helped me feel that I am not crazy just highly reactive to situations that don't annoy others in the least. I plan on following up on the suggested reading list and maybe going outside this year! (just kidding). Great book!
B001VLXNLU|4.0|Love the twists and turns. I started reading this in jail, well in the middle of the series, and I gotta say it's very interesting how she gets to where she's at.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Every mother with a grown up son should watch this movies. It is just hilarious! Everyone who has seen this movie loves it!
0783114893|5.0|This is one of the top scary movies from the 80's. I remember loving it then and now I purchased it to add to my collection. I had not seen it in 20 years and I have to say that it is still a really good movie with good acting and a great story line. This scenario could really happen, which makes it scary to me. I definitely recommend adding this one to your collection or buying it if you just want a good scary movie.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|Bought 4 more CDs after getting this one.  They dont make songs like this anymore<br />.  Love having all these great songs on the cloud to enjoy anywhere and on any device.

B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is the best slender man game I ever got on Kindle, also the scariest, because not only slendy can teleport, he could come out of nowhere if you look the wrong way, and do not play this in midnight, every night mare I had so far, 2/3 of them are filled with slender. So it's worth the money.

B001F6ZIXW|5.0|This show keeps the viewer engaged and on the end of their seat.  I find it highly addictive and I'm glad I didn't watch it when it first came to television.  I wouldn't be able to wait weekly for a new episode.

B005KR6OBM|5.0|What a great deal to grab the first 4 seasons for one low price.  It is so nice to watch the episodes minus all of the commercials that the networks insert.
B00555X8OA|5.0|It's funny... As a human being  for all of my life, I never realized how my brain worked. I knew all about neurons, synapses, neurotransmitters, etc., but never how the brain operated in action. This book is essentially and owners manual for the brain. It describes how you think and consequently why you think the way you do. This book is build upon a foundation of many years of scientific research conducted by the author himself; it's not the latest fad. I strongly recommend this book to absolutely anyone, plus its easy to read!
B004H4XI5O|5.0|Without memory who are we?  Ubiquitous cameras that seem to be recording our every experience along with the low cost of external memory storage combine to promise and threaten our memories.  What does that really mean to our fundamental concept of self?<br />Joshua Foer provides facts and ideas with which to approach these questions in his fascinating and informative book, Moonwalking With Einstein.  It is a nonfiction book written like a novel.  While reading about true-life characters wacky enough to be creations of Comedy Central writers, you inadvertently learn a lot about memory.<br />The book traces the history of ideas about memory as well as practical tips and techniques for improving yours (for example: the title has to do with a memory technique).  Studies about how the brain handles memory are reported.  All these features are folded into the narrative of how the author spent a year preparing for the U.S. Memory Championship.  This is a creative work of non-fiction at its best.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Adobe reader is the best reader made and I am thankful to Adobe for designing the reader for Kindle Fire HD
B001OGWY1W|1.0|Just when it was getting exciting, we couldn't finish watching it. The movie is great but Amazon's service was despicable and there is no way we could find anywhere on amazon.com to dispute the charge or get a refund or anything.

B00280LYIC|5.0|The one word for this book from me is wow!<br />From page two, this book had me hooked. Once you start you can't put the book down. This book is interesting, funny, and exciting, there is also education hidden in the pages. I have learned more about Greek Mythology in this series of books then any where else. The action throughout this book only makes you want to read more. Great job Rick Riordan!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game because you can really feel like your taking care of a horse. My horses name is beauty and I love her. If you want a fun game and you love horses there is no better game to get. You get to groom your horse and feed it and give it treats you even get to enter your horse it competitions it's soo much fun. You'll never ho to a different game
B00ATPVA78|5.0|So far I am liking this game. It has great graphics and a good story line. Pretty easy to get the hang of the puzzles in the game.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale<br /> has so Much to offer. It's like a zoo for dragons. You can feed them care for them and make habitats for them. This app is even free.
B00425S1H8|2.0|I cannot speak on whether this device works on other Windows OS environments but in the Windows 8 Pro arena it failed, miserably.  I could not handle data traffic in any broadcast mode.  I ended up getting a FTDI Chip - USB to Serial Adapter and it worked flawlessly.  Buyer beware!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Excellent follow-up book!<br />I was laughing at how pathetically sad and parallel the story was with my actual IT experience!<br />What an eye-opener.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This calculator makes calculating fractions a dream! Particularly helpful with recipes....no more looking for the 'least common denominator' (if it's still called that!)
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I don't understand why this app isn't more popular I love it. I've been using it for an hour and haven't had any problems. I was tired of opening the browser on my kindle and got my wish. Very happy with the app.

B001MEJY8W|2.0|WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT MARTYRS.WELL I WANT TO SAY IT WAS PRETTY GOOD BUT I CANT BECAUSE IT WAS PRETTY BAD TOO. I CAN SAY THAT THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF THE MOVIE WAS A GOOD IDEA AND IT PROBABLY COULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD IDEA FOR A MOVIE IF THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME FORM OF PLOT.THERE WASNT.THERE WAS WAY TO MANY SCENES OF JUMPINF FORWARD AND JUMPING BACK WHICH CAUSES THE VIEWER DISTRACTION.THIS WAS ANOTHER OF THE NEWER 'SO CALLED' HORROR MOVIES THAT DOESNT LIVE UP TO ALL THE HYPE. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOLKS.THERE IS NOTHING SCARY OR FRIGHTFUL ABOUT THIS MOVIE EXCEPT THE TIME ONE WASTES TO WATCH THIS LAME BRAIN STUPIDITY.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One of the best apps for the kindle-hd. The game play is challenging and reminiscent of the Myst series. The graphics are well rendered. Motion and movement throughout the game are smooth.
B009HUB40Y|2.0|Fun game. Great for keeping me busy in between commercials while I'm watching television! Very similar to bejeweled. Not fond of the many advertisements. I was fun until I ran out of lives and realized I had to buy more or wait an allotted time before you can continue game play. Would have given it 4 stars otherwise. I'm tempted to uninstall from my tablet :(
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Why does anyone need a review for Game of Thrones. Either you love it or you hate it, probably the former, possibly both. But if you are somehow on the fence, here are my comments.<br /><br /> - This series is extremely graphic, both in terms of violence and in terms of sex content. I have no hard feelings towards those who call Game of Thrones &#34;elf porn&#34;. Both forms of graphic content often feel gratuitous, or included just for the shock factor. Game of Thrones is more &#34;gritty and visceral&#34; than &#34;elegant&#34;, I would say.<br /> - This series is interpersonally and morally very rich. The protagonists are by and large very complex people, and they create some very fascinating situations. This character complexity is to me the main appeal of the series.<br /> - The music, visuals, and acting are top-notch, as good as anything you've watched. This series is a real tribute to Martin's books (actually... series 1 is just the first book), and I'm grateful for the precedent it sets for production quality of fantasy TV serieses.
B00009W0U4|1.0|What a waste of celluoid.There is nothing scary,gross or even remotley suspenseful about this move. All the hype i read about this flick i figured it would be good. It wasnt,it stunk.BORING.The story line sucks and so does the camera work and spelling all the opening credits backwards gave me a headache.I woudnt have the nerve to sell this or even trade this to someone else,thats how lame this flick was.Completly un-realistic.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Heard about this series from a friend, cought my eye, love that BBC is funding it. Well worth watching. Excited to see more
B0063M22QO|5.0|Very challenging and entertaining. I have played Mahjong on my desk top computer and the Kindle has a variety of towers to play.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Game of Thrones is many things and I won't bother to belabor them. Season 2 has many of the strengths and weaknesses of season 1. If you loved season 1, why are you reading this review? Just buy it. Otherwise, here are a couple comments:<br /><br /> - This season is probably more sexually graphic than the first. Sometimes, this is woven into the story; often it feels gratuitous. I have no hard feelings towards those who call Game of Thrones &#34;elf porn&#34;.<br /> - I think season 2 gets slightly deeper, philosophically, than season 1. Some protagonists make troubling decisions that could inspire good discussion.<br /> - The music, visuals, and acting are as stellar as fans have come to expect.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Great game, it really makes you think and I think its great exercise for your eyes and mind. Just clear the board, your on the clock but that's ok, you have plenty of time to finish!

B00CL68NOG|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie, I really liked it as a matter of fact I plan to add this one to my library. Seth Rogen and Barbara Streisand made a good team. I hope they are in another comedy again. This movie was hilarious with of course some drama just a really good story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The begining of a wonderful series! I own the books, but now I have the series available on my Nexus 4 and 7!

I have nothing against MoJang of Johann Bernhardson but please update!<br /> (p.s. add enchanting and redstone please)<br />Another thing have to pick with MoJang is that SurvivalCraft has horses and a redstone equivalent. It's also only 3.99 compared to Minecraft PE being 6.99. I am not encouraging you to buy SurvivalCraft because I like MCPE better from what I've heard.

030758836X|5.0|It has been a while since I have picked up a book, or got one on my kindle that held me so tight that I ran out of battery life on one unit, and had to seek another to finish gobbling it up! I definitely did not expect any of the twists and turns..and REALLY did not expect the ending...could there be a part two? Who's to say!
B001DM1VXE|2.0|I did not care to watch this b/w film. Maybe I was too tired or not in the mood when I watched it. It just did not make any sense to me. Perhaps I would have a better experience if I tried it again. I know there are better films to watch, and it will be awhile before I attempt to watch it again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My second favorite out of the three books, and read almost 6 times! The series is wonderful. I own the books, but now I have the series available on my Nexus 4 and 7!
030758836X|2.0|Yes, here in the South we say 'cussing' more than 'cursing.' If you are from this region of the country you understand. Cussing is usually done by people who are uneducated and substitute cuss words because they think it makes them sound real. Thus, for characters who are supposedly well educated and socially appropriate, they have a rudimentary vocabulary at best.  Yes, I was offended by the over-use of f***, GD, s*** etc.  Are today's writers stymied by the dictionary?  Likewise, the extremely graphic sex act descriptions were distasteful. I understand that our protagonist(s) were: a slimy adulterous male and a sociopathic female, but is it necessary to nasty up a story to make is sellable? just saying these are truly two morally bankrupt individuals.  In closing: it was an easy read and an interesting story line (though not particularly plausible), but it should come with a warning label and a disclaimer that this is not prize winning prose. I bought a hardcover copy; not sure if I will donate to the library or to the trash bin.

B008QE9XD2|4.0|very good Johnny Depp movie,,,,  I Love Eva Green's eyes and the rest of her. see it for your self.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|Now, I'll admit off the bat that I have read the Hobbit quite a few times since I was a child and had it read to me quite a few times before I could read.  So yes, I love the book.  For anyone with a similar background, I can confidently say you're best served not watching the film.  Simple as that, read no further.<br /><br />...that said, I probably differ from a lot of the people who loved the book in that I didn't expect a perfect word for word re-enactment of the book.  I figured it would be have to be different from a logistical standpoint - how do you cram a whole book, or even a third of a book, into a relatively short time for the sake of the movie?<br /><br />I found myself, not offended by this movie as a lover of the book, but just laughing a lot.  I estimate at least 50% of the events in the film don't happen in the book.  Another 40% is composed of CGI action extrapolated off events that kinda sorta did happen in the book but not really.  The remaining 10% was kind of pleasant I guess.  They got the appearance of some things right.  A few times, they had characters say some of the actual lines from the book, although much less frequently than you'd think.<br /><br />But it was VERY strange - practically every major event in the book is altered away from what it was and a lot of little things got altered - during the cleaning of the dishes, they omitted \\"...so carefully carefully with the plates\\" in favor of repeating an earlier part of the song - they didn't save any time with the omission and lost some of the meaning of what was going on. ...or when they finally got around to the opening couple sentences from the book, they changed them.  \\"... it was a hobbit hole and that means comfort ...able THINGS\\"?  And for instance, they made the dwarves oafish, rude, and kind of dumb instead of the exceedingly polite educated highborn fellows they were - which made it more difficult to understand why Bilbo had a hard time turning them away.  So instead of getting to know the dwarves a little bit and perhaps liking them, sympathizing with them, they remain relatively generic and un-likeable, which is why later they have to develop the new subplot of Bilbo's pity for them \\"Oh I have a home and you don't\\" in place of what worked in the book.  Because otherwise Bilbo's actions don't make sense at all.  The additions, rather than streamlining the book into a film, created more work the authors had to backtrack later to try and repair.  Does Bilbo's sympathy for the dwarves in the last 20 minutes of the film make up for them being made into such unsympathetic characters at the beginning?  The writers end up creating problems that take even longer to solve than it would have to just do the original thing.  This really is a case of short cuts make for long delays.<br /><br />And of course there's all the extra mind numbing action with all the action cliches - people yelling \\"nooooooo!\\" in slow-mo happens over and over.  So much $#!% happens so quickly in such an undulating CGI consequence-free unreality, that it takes you out of the story and straight out of the movie.<br /><br />...so you end up with this film that is bloated with alterations, additions, and CGI action.  You'd figure the additions, at least the action, was there to keep it exciting, but the overall effect is  surprisingly BORING.<br /><br />I'd heard there was a lot of \\"extra stuff\\" in the movie and was prepared to give it a chance but wow, just wow.  My point isn't so much \\"Hey they diverged from the book,\\" but my god, they went to a LOT of trouble to diverge from the book with a bunch of 3rd rate material when using the original stuff would have been EASIER, then dragged in unnecessary stuff from the LOTR to do a number on that too, then added a whole bunch of extra new stuff that was even worse.  It's amazing that, in deciding to alter so much for the sake of making it into a movie, we end up with a 3 hour movie where the majority of the movie wasn't part ofthe book OR the appendices.<br /><br />It's as if they wanted to make, idunno, Krull With Rabbit Sleighs but get everyone to buy it by referencing The Hobbit - only to blunder every reference and fail with their new material.<br /><br />I honestly don't feel that my childhood story was ruined any way - this is so far from the original, I don't recognize it - just embarrassed for the makers of this film.  Standing on its own as a film unconnected with any book, it's a confused, boring, cliched mess.  Guillermo Del Toro I'm embarrassed for more than anyone, although he showed the good sense to leave the project, so maybe, hopefully, he's the least to blame.  He's never produced a lame, boring, cliche-ridden turkey like this before so I'll give him a pass - we'll see in July with Pacific Rim if he's still got the magic or not.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a fantasy movie, skip this and do, idunno, Krull, Ladyhawke, Legend, Stardust, Princess Bride, Willow, Any of the Harry Potters, the Narias weren't TOO bad I hear, Time Bandits... I guess you could throw in Highlander if you like.  If you want to go the sword and sorcery route and don't mind on-purpose campiness, there's beastmaster and the various conan movies.

B003UYV08E|3.0|I was bored during the grand finale and was checking my email.  Iron Man 3 and Iron Man was definitely better, but maybe it was because I was held captive in a theater?<br /><br />How many times have we seen a deranged person seek vengeance for a battle between fathers/ancestors?  Yawn!!<br /><br />I love that the director is Happy, or is it vice versa?  I don't think I've seen a director cast himself in a part before, but I could be wrong.  I thought it was genius.

B004LROUNG|4.0|I don't read much fiction but discovered John Grisham 19 years ago and became an avid fan. If you are familiar with his work you know how the storyline will develop and can anticipate the ending. This book doesn't deviate from the formula much. A very enjoyable read for all Grisham fans.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Ok, technically this is a science fiction novel but the science part only covers the premise or background of this amazing story.<br />I tend to categorize fictional books into a few groups that I like or don't. Primarily (to me anyway) there are dialogue novels where the story is usually written in third person and is primarily driven by the dialog of the characters. Clive Cussler is a master at this type of story. These are the types of novels I like the most. The ones that let MY imagination do the work of building a scene or a place.<br />I'm not much of a fan of what I call \\"descriptive\\" novels where your imagination is not allowed to wander and the author spends an inordinate amount of time describing useless information about a scene that has no bearing on the story. Stephen King is one of the worst at this, spending line after line describing a pack of cigarettes laying on the floor in a room the character will only be in once and the cigarettes are never mentioned again. It's like he's getting paid by the word and I have to suffer through mindless drivel to get to the point. Gentry Lee is another one of these types of writer but I don't think Gentry Lee even understands some of the garbage they pay him to write.<br />Oddly though I would classify this novel as a \\"descriptive\\" novel but in this case it's the description that drives the story. I guess it's because my imagination can't imagine what it would be like for humanity to be stored away in a silo like grain being stored away to last trough the bad days.(Solo) <<(you'll understand if you read it) I find myself dying to know more about the silo, the \\"bad days\\" that created them, the bad days that can destroy a silo.<br />Hugh Howey seems to offer a nearly perfect balance of dialog and description that keep this story so riveting that I can't wait to burn through it as fast as possible.<br />While the classification of this story is technically science fiction it's only because it's semi-futuristic. Thetechnology of the story is apparently current day but in this story Moore's Law has been frozen and humanity is forced to stagnate in order to survive. Curiosity and advancement only lead to depression and disenchantment with the status quo.<br />This story explores the ramifications of what would happen if humanity were FORCED to accept the status quo or perish either singularly according to the \\"Order\\" or en masse by way of the \\"Uprising\\". It tests, in the most profound way, the adage \\"The truth will set you free.\\"<br />...or will it?
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I love this game cuz its so scary!i love it!try it at night without lights.im 11 and i did it,scary!
B002RI9PKO|5.0|Fascinating and insightful. Tends to cause you to want to reevaluate your own success or lack thereof. Advantage is most often gained without control of the source.
B004R13U6Y|1.0|As noted by others using Kindle Fire HD, neither Dropbox nor Google Docs connects with this app, making it fairly useless. Would have been nice to know before I bought it. Amazon needs to get over it's fear/animosity/dislike/jealousy of Dropbox and Google Docs. I'm close to dropping the Kindle altogether and going iPad just to have access to my data again. Now, how do I get my $4 back?
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I have never read a novel like this that took me through so many emotions. I felt anger for the little boy who was so mistreated in that orphanage. To find out that this was based on some of the real experiences that these children were put through is appalling. I wonder how many of them did take their lives because they were so abused. I dreaded starting the chapters that started with \\"86.\\"<br />I loved the sweetness of this man who was so humble. The gallant friends who stood by him, the Dr who was not only a physician but psychologist, who truly cared about his patients were brought to life so beautifully just touched my heart.<br />I was transported between love and hate on each chapter. This was an incredible read and I recommended it to all my family and friends. Thank you Christina!

B000JMKTLO|5.0|Definitely a page turner! Its a suspenseful thriller that is just as good as her other books - Gone Girl & Dark Places. Highly recommended!
B008XKSW7M|4.0|good movie especially for anyone who has ever been pregnant.  I was able to relate to two of the girls and it helped remind me why i dont want anymore kids :)
B004J4WKUQ|2.0|I think a forty something nerd watched avatar and then got out his old video game consoles and D&D books and wrote a novel that makes The Hunger Games seem like Dostoevsky.  I'm all for pulp sci-fi books, but after reading all the reviews, I was expecting more.  I will say that I did finish the book, but only because I actually paid for it.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Pretty fun. Awesome campaign but controls are hard to get used to. Not too expensive either, so overall good buy.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Dark Places was probably my favorite Gillian Flynn book - a suspenseful thriller that you can't put down. It is unpredictable and will keep you guessing. Some parts a very disturbing, but overall it was a great read!

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love the premium version as much as the free versoin - especially since it was the AOTD when I snagged it at no cost.  I enjoy being able to set the timer and fall asleep to my favorite sounds.  You can't go wrong with this app if you are looking for some custom sounds to relax by or fall asleep to.  I highly recommend - can't think of a negative, especially if you can get the premium version for free!

B00CLOTNLK|2.0|I definitely am a huge fan of prog rock and metal, and was very excited for this CD.  For me it was a letdown overall.  Sure, there are some solid tracks that have been mentioned in other reviews, however, as a whole I found the album dull and not particularly progressive.  After about ten listens now I am confident I won't be playing this CD again.  Given the lineage on drums and rave reviews, I may have come in to this one with exaggerated expectations.  I think what may have disappointed me the most was the fact I stumbled on to another progressive rock/metal band the same day who in my opinion puts Sound of Contact to shame for originality and excitement.  If you are truly looking for original and new \\"progressive\\" rock/metal, give the band Leprous a listen out on YouTube.  After simultaneously listening to both the past couple of Leprous albums and Sound of Contact, there is simply no comparison.  Anyone who gives Leprous a shot, I hope you enjoy it as much as I am.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|If Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption, James Cameron's Titanic, and Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat made you believe in the power of story, then so shall Ang Lee's Life of Pi by way of Yann Martel's book of the same title. Like Shawshank Redemption, the protagonist undergoes physical, mental, and emotional damage that will either kill him or make him stronger although transformed. Like Titanic, a ship goes down and carries away family, safety, and security upon its descent. Like Lifeboat, an unusual mix of characters share tight, claustrophobic, treacherous quarters in a bid to survive at sea. Life of Pi is a beautiful story well-matched with breathtaking cinematography, visual effects, and sound design. Based upon the strength of these separate elements operating together in excellence, Ang Lee won Best Director.<br /><br />Truly fantastic is the powerful allegorical revelation of God in science based upon two interpretations of horrific, life-changing tragedies in the world of the protagonist a teenage boy. A storm at sea throws Pi either into the hands of God, or Mother Nature, or as Pi would have it--both. Driven to his physical, mental, and emotional limits while adrift for 227 days in the Pacific Ocean, Pi addresses the strains on his capacities by adapting to his horrific reality via spiritual, religious, scientific means, or perhaps cognitive dissonance.<br /><br />Some may view Pi's interpretations of his reality as opposite and therefore impossible. Others may view Pi's interpretations as complementary, and entirely reasonable. One step further and the viewer may even choose to accept the concept of God as the creator of all science and all scientific laws, God as the creator of evolution. Two steps further and the viewer may understand that logic and reason remain entirely compatible with religion and spiritualism. After two viewings, the only surprise that remains with Life of Pi is that it did not win the award for adapted screenplay.
B007THA4FI|1.0|It's hard to believe that  a writer with Rowlings skill could produce this.  There is not one character that I cared about.  The writing seems to be of a forced intensity.  Save your money.

0770437400|5.0|World War Z is the natural third step in the exploration by Max Brooks of zombie zeitgeist. First came the Zombie Survival Guide, a send-up of world gone bad survivalist literature complete with discussion on supplies, weapons, and home fortification techniques. Then came the graphic novel Zombie Survival Guide: Recorded Attacks which expanded upon a fascinating section in the appendix of the first book. And now, Brooks has presented a full-length fiction written in the style of creative non-fiction, if you can imagine Studs Terkel's The Good War as a series of interviews with survivors of the zombie war, also known as World War Z. Like The Good War, World War Z draws its strength from the monumental cross-section of people or characters telling their tales of fear, despair, frustration, anger, survival, endurance, hope, and inspiration. Fans of horror, of George Romero, of Tim Matheson will enjoy this brilliant, respectful, stand-up addition to zombie canon. Fans of military science, of geopolitics, of public policy will understand immediately the allegory to current world affairs. Fans of speculative fiction will feel the chill when reading the accounts of world events written so reasonably that they could be true... tomorrow. Because Brooks includes so many stories and quite a bit of research, there's something for everyone in World War Z. One particular favorite is the story of a downed helicopter pilot who relies upon a voice in the dark to guide her out of zombie-infested territory to safety... and then a twist. Highly recommended.
B00004WEJZ|5.0|Great
1857988094|5.0|Such an insanely great book!  My goodness!  If there was a book written for me that has all the points I want in a great book this one has it!  Sci-Fi, horror, science, a bit of religion, the human condition, post-apocalyptic, self-analysis, emotion...my goodness the emotion.  This books is ahead of its time and I would say that 100+ years for now it'll still be relevant (originally published in 1954 - it doesn't read like it).  I was preparing to compare a few of the movies that the book was based on but nothing holds a candle to this torch.  I loved the believability of the vampirism and the use of both natural science and psychology in the explanation.  The semi-first person perspective is great for a solo-man story.  The range of emotions Neville goes through is believable and heartfelt.  I wouldn't be surprised if Matheson didn't do a bunch of research on isolation before writing this book.  I honestly cannot say enough good things about this book.  This is what makes sci-fi an amazing genre.  Pick up this book and read it - read it twice!  Final Grade - A+

B006FO3ERQ|3.0|Although I've read hundreds of books from all types of genres, I am a newcomer to the work of Richard Ford. I would like to share some thoughts that may influence your buying decision of this book. The most important observation I can make is that this book is not for everyone. It will appeal to a specific group of people and be very bland to everyone else.<br /><br />Canada is a lengthy novel that deals with difficult themes and took the author over 20 years to write. The plot can be summarized in 3-5 sentences, so if you enjoy plot-driven novels, this book is not for you. There is almost a complete absence of action sequences or thrilling plot twists. The characters are deep and described in extreme detail. One memorable sequence describes one of the main characters' eyes for 2-3 pages. The narrator, Dell Parsons, and his sister Berner have especially interesting character arcs and notable developments as people throughout the novel. The writing is deliberate, long-winded, and descriptive almost to a fault.<br /><br />In my view, there are two polar opposite styles of writing- there is the short, verb-oriented writing that some people call the \\"screenplay\\" style. These types of stories are amenable to being adapted to a film because they are action driven, and therefore can be entertaining as the basis for a more visual art form. At the opposite end of the spectrum is the \\"literary\\" style, which is long, adjective and adverb oriented writing that spends time on every single detail of a scene, from the place settings on the table, to the hot smell in the air, to the unkempt whiskers on a man's chin. These word pictures are not amenable to a visual art form because they are trying to get the reader to imagine the scene and use their mind to tell the story. Every book can fall somewhere on this continuum, with authors like Hemingway or Asimov sitting on the far end of the verb-oriented action writing, many shades of grey in the middle, and Richard Ford all the way onthe opposite side of things on the adjective-oriented descriptive writing. By way of making my point, I would estimate that I could tell the entire story of Canada in a 12-15 minute short film without missing any key plot developments.<br /><br />This may seem relatively shallow, but I just don't understand the appeal of books like this. Reviewers are giving it 5 stars and critics are praising this book as a \\"towering masterpiece of fiction\\" and other such hyperbole. I love authors that write in this general style (EG: Michael Chabon), but I don't enjoy this particular book nearly as much as other people are saying because I feel as though Ford is almost saying \\"look how literary my books are! My vocabulary is so big, haven't you noticed?\\" It just doesn't seem natural to me.<br /><br />TL;DR: This book is a great example of slow, adjective driven writing that is almost completely devoid of plot. If you enjoy books in that style, by all means read it, but if you are used to anything with plot twists and action sequences, you will be sorely disappointed.

That being said, I guess I enjoyed them and would like to see how it ends.  I have only one disappointment;  the author refers to a sword which has magical powers,  I would have  liked  more background information.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I mean I love it and all but it can get kinda boring after awhile. I rate it four stars
B00CKJTOHO|3.0|The writers are struggling to move the over-arching plot to a conclusion in a coherent fashion. The results are mediocre.
B00003CXSP|4.0|In my opinion, this is probably the best Hannibal Lecter movie, with MANHUNTER coming in second although it lacks Hopkins and involves HL minimally.  Very few horror movies can boast the amount of first-rate talent found in this one: Ridley Scott, David Mamet, Anthony Hopkins, and Giancarlo Giannini.  Julianne Moore is no worse than Jodie Foster in the main female role, but neither is convincing to me.  Scott, Mamet, and Hopkins add considerable depth to the HL character and succeed in an almost impossible task of making this monster both attractive and likable in a perverse sense.  The main problem with the movie is its excesses (common to most such movies nowadays): HL is simply TOO dangerous and efficient.  Also (not to give too much of a spoiler), the \\"brain\\" business is silly.  The movie should have ended with HL kissing Julianne Moore. What comes afterward is medically stupid and unbelievable.

0061726834|4.0|While the story took a while to get going and the main character was sometimes annoying, overall I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed Delirium. Oliver's writing is fantastic and sweeps you into the story. There are characters to root for and some exciting parts that really get your heart pumping. If you at all like romance and/or dystopia, you will want to read this book.<br /><br />*8/10*
B008K9UZY4|4.0|Being a big Sonic fan, I try to get as much Sonic merchandise as I can. When I saw this on the Android store, I was very happy and got it. It's a VERY good game. I would have rated it higher, but it is pretty hard. But, if you're a Sonic fan, GET THIS GAME!
1250012570|5.0|Eleanor & Park was a novel I was not expecting to love, yet I fell head over heels for it. The characters are flawed but relatable, and the story is bittersweet yet still full of hope. It is well written and drew me in and kept me until it broke my heart and then pieced it back together. This is definitely a novel that I'll be thinking about for a long while.<br /><br />*9.5/10*
B009IF8CH6|5.0|From jokes about advance physics to Sheldon Cooper is smelly pooper.  The Big Bang Theory is incredibly intelligent but also so relatable (through  the intermixing of such different characters).  you can actually learn a lot from the show but you don't have to either. You can just let the technical talk flow by you and enjoy the jokes and interplay amongst the characters.
0525478817|5.0|I don't want to just say that I love The Fault in Our Stars because it's not enough. This book is different in how it makes me feel than almost any other novel I've ever read. It means something to me, reaches me on a different spectrum, and I will forever be grateful that I read it and got to experience it. I will say that Green is brilliant for this novel that didn't feel at all like a novel. I recommend it to anyone and everyone who is presently, or will later be, alive.<br /><br />*10/10*
B005HED11Y|5.0|Good quality, not a bad price.  Good download speeds.<br /><br />Classic episode, top 10 for sure.<br /><br />There is always a moral story to a Star Trek episode, so talking about some of them with my daughter seemed a little educational.
B00BRYDKM8|4.0|As a professional speaker and speaker's trainer, I have read many books on the topic of public speaking. How To Deliver a Great Ted Talk, by Akash Karia, is an excellent primer for those who want to learn the formula for structuring a great talk. The outline that the author has provided is simple to follow and it can be used to prepare for any talk. I like that he has linked to some of the more popular Ted talks as it gives the reader a frame of reference for the subject at hand. One can learn the basic fundamentals of speaking from this book. However, like other activities such as dancing, swimming, or riding a bicycle you can read about it all day long but in the end the only way to become proficient, is to do it over, and over, and over again.
B000PWQPAC|5.0|wasn't late, it was one time and it was a great movie. I just wish they were still making this show though &#62;_&#60; haha..
0345529057|5.0|I like watching the series and reading the books at the same time. There are alot of characters so it helps me to keep everyone straight. :)
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is an epic book with just about anything a Sci-Fi reader would want.  It has drama, intrigue, betrayal and closure, as all great books should!
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Excellent movie! Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hitchcock deserves consideration when passing out awards, as does Ms Murren's portrayal of his wife.....
B005I0C5M8|5.0|I have been looking at this live in London 1974 2 disc set for a while and had it on my wish list.i have to say its a great live album from the 70s.i went to the California jam in 1974 and have the dvd and cd box set of the 1974 concert.it was the tour of there new album BURN. it was a great concert..the London concert was the same line up as the California jam  and both sounds great.i love the 30 minutes space truckin on the London cd.this is a cd I will listen to often. if  you like deep purple this is a cd you got to have.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Get this app its really awesome totally fun get it like I said its super fun so get it please get it
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a great book club read.  The book can be discussed from many different angles. It's a relationship story with a very controversial underlying subject matter.  The book is very well written and, although not action packed, for me it was a page-turner.  I can't say too much without giving the story away and that's not the point of my review.  I just want to inform anyone who is interested in the book after reading it's description that I thought it was excellent.  The characters are engaging and likeable and although it takes place in England centered around a very affluent family, I could relate to the sub-characters as well as the main characters.  I just loved it and recommend it highly.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Got a little addicted to it.  Wish it was longer, but a fun game!  I liked that you could get hints if you were stuck.
B005HSL626|5.0|LOVE this game! love the two player option, so both kids can play. A great time killer! Highly recommend this game.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Charlaine Harris is and always is a great writer.  She takes you into the story and the characters lives and makes it fun. I will miss Sookie, Bill, and Eric!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game! You only use two pedals- gas and brake- and gather gas cans and gold coins and get as far as you can. I love the fact that you don't have to worry about steering also. My 8 and 4 year olds love this game too. A great time killer!
B00881PTRC|3.0|I'm just not a big fan of hang man but this is a good game for those who enjoy hang man. The game itself has a lot of options like subjects and levels of difficulties. As well as three different kinds of  hand man that some with different graphics as you play them. One looks like a school chalkboard, another has flowers, another has snowmen, the last one has a animated drawing on lined yellow paper.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I guess it is time to end this series.  The last novel was depressing. This one  lacked the humor  and romance that the rest of the series had. As a reader you cannot always choose who the heroin ends up with, but there was not enough build up of the relationships.  Plus the demise of Sookie and Eric's relationship was so swift. This book was blah and disappointing.
B00181MHQU|5.0|I had seen this in a theater many years ago and, liking musicals, I loved it then. I revisited the film after having seen Rita Morino interviewed on television during the last month (May 2013). She played the older friend of Natalie Wood's character, Maria. They talk of willing suspension of disbelief in literature, and of course in a musical that is required. Still, there is a beautiful story here and while it seemed to me to have a slower wind up at this point in my life, it still had a good pitch. (No musical pun intended) Rita who is in her 80s now still looks amazing. With Natalie Wood many do not know was of Russian extraction and I understand she spoke the language. She was certainly among the most beautiful if not the most beautiful women of her generation. This film, for any person who loves music, still holds up.<br /><br />Monmouth Illinois
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm so upset it's over! This series was amazing but it was really sad how everything ended up playing out. Definitely wasn't anything I was expecting. Spoiler alert: I was kind of hoping for Gale to be the chosen one, yet I'm not even mad that it was peeta. I'm just going to have to be satisfied with waiting for the movies to come out!
1577311523|3.0|There were mark and dos-earred (bent pages) throughout the book. As a rule, this is not something that i admire in ANY book. It is a disrectful act and dishonors the piece.
B004YF6MHW|4.0|still in the learning stage but it seems pretty good so far.  I will have more to say a little later.
1454701250|5.0|The rubber stamp method is very well detailed in this book.<br />It explains in detail the tools that you need to make them, and the illustrations and explanations are great!!
B00957T6X6|5.0|I hadn't read a book for pleasure in a very long time. Needless to say I'm glad this book came along to give me the interest again. Bottom line, read this book, it's worth it!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|My kids love this game however it won't update to miami now they are very disappointed....I wish you guys will hurry up and get the new game in
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is definitely one of my fav reads for 2013. One of the best lines, imho ... There's no backup, and they think I'll die instantly without it.  To them equipment failure is terrifying.  To me, its \\"Tuesday\\"...
B003UESJH4|5.0|Great used copy! Couldn't dream of paying full price when you get quality dvds for cheaper! Made a great gift!
B004EF65QA|5.0|Didn't know much about this era and looked up on line after watching show, but really liked this show about this period of time.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Highly addictive, watch at your own risk as you may not be able to stop once you start watching season 1.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was awesome! Never a dull moment. I look forward to the next book. The characters are well developed and interesting.
1780721676|5.0|both my husband and i are trying the &#34;fasting&#34; as described in the book. i recommend the PBS companion program.
B009NY43NY|5.0|While I was a bit disappointed with some of the books in this series, the ending novel was right on point. In it the reader gets to experience the final growth of Sookie from a &#34;freaky&#34; outcast and a hapless heroine bound by her circumstances and love for the men in her life to become an independent woman who understands her place in the world. While the ending is not a real surprise, Sookie's final line makes the reader want to shout out, &#34;You go, girl!&#34;
B000FA675C|5.0|The book was very well written. I was at the edge of my seat waiting to see what the next clue to the mystery would be. Dan Brown did not disappoint. This is a must read for anyone who enjoys a good mystery.
B007AJFSJW|1.0|I have been following Krugman on and off since the early 2000s. He has been wrong on almost every single prediction. The only people who have been more wrong than Krugman and still get to keep their job are the weathermen. He was wrong on Bush tax cuts predictions, wrong on stimulus, wrong on German austerity (Germany is one of the best performing economies in Europe). The guy even used to be a fiscal hawk under Bush and now is a spendaholic under Obama.<br /><br />Krugman was on CNN a few years back where he claimed that building up to fight an alien invasion will get us out of this recession. Think about that for a second: does building tanks and bombs to fight the aliens make our lives better? Anyone with commons sense would say no. Think about the resources and labor that will go into building these that could otherwise be used to produce consumer goods that make our lives better. In a Keynesian's mind any spending is good as long as we are spending. Krugman was on Charlie Rose recently with Joe Scarborough where he said that he wouldn't cut military spending even the wasteful military spending. If you ask Krugman will building pyramids get us out of this recession, I guarantee he will say yes. Krugman is batsh** insane.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|There is nothing inherently bad about this cable, I was just under the impression that it was longer than the original cable that came with the unit and I would no longer be required to sit next to an outlet if I wanted to use it and needed a charge. It IS longer...two inches longer. Perhaps Kindle should offer a variety of lengths. I found this option aggravating at best, misleading at worst.
B001F4UHGC|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever.  It is especially good from the late 1960's.  The care chase is the best ever made.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It's too much work to get from one spot to another so I rarely use this app on my kindle anymore. I save it for my pc or smartphone
B0098WVT9W|4.0|Lee has always been a technical wiz and I am noticing his playing becoming more than just flash and making musical statements.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|Great game lots of fun play it constantly lots of replay value<br />would recommend it worth the money  buy it now
B00B3EV8IU|4.0|Robben plays very subdued but his choice of notes is very well done.  He seems to be making a musical statement beyond just great guitar.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|good game just needs more things like lions and tigers dinosaurs other than that good game so enjoy! love<br />  Cats
B0096YBEIS|4.0|They are not missing a beat with Chuck, who is a fine guitarist.  The music of Fourplay continues to grow.
B008Y78M60|3.0|Enjoyed the movie.  Not likely to watch again but historical information was interesting. Good parallels to &#34;Lincoln&#34; that was in theaters this past year.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Loved every word of all five books. Can't wait for next book..confusing jump from book 4 to book 5. Great!
B009NY43NY|3.0|I think Ms. Harris has done better with some of the earlier novels-&#34;Living Dead In Dallas&#34; was particularly good. I look forward to her future works.
B004G8ZZHU|3.0|Lots of laughs and big explosions. nice escape with friends and family. We sat and made comments through the whole thing. Don't expect a literary classic or thought provoking plot. Quotable one-liners.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game, my daughter likes it but thinks it costs a lot to get new horses. It has decent graphics.
B008VBYN80|5.0|This is the best game ever! I played it for hours and hours. It is awesome and fun. I LOVE IT.
B000Q79HS8|5.0|Wow what a SUSPENSEFUL movie. Keeps you on for feet! Highly re- commended. Would consider renting in high definition again!

B000FCKGPC|4.0|You'll see what I mean when you get to the end.<br /><br />Please finish the books now, George.<br /><br />Kay thanks bye
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I would recommend this book for anyone who wants a little adventure in your life. As the third book in this wonderful series, it surely doesn't disappoint! I just wish it wasn't the last one!
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|if this album doesn't get album of the year.<br /><br />having said that, it's not for everyone.  some dance, heavy 70's disco influence but an infectious beat.  if you like daft and have an open mind, you might even think this is among the best they've done
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Very helpful. You will . Learn how to manage a community and take care of animals... especially those who are in need. As a veterinary medicine student, this game helps me in considering wildlife as me specialization.  :3 Great!

B000FBFMZ2|5.0|Raymond Chandler in the 25th century. Very cold, very dry, great stuff. I've read all of Chandler, I can only hope there are more Morgan stories to come.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|It was enjoyable. No senseless violence. The end of the movie was a little too fast and seemed thrown together.
B00AV68GOA|5.0|Even tho it was an unnecessary purchase, I enjoyed skimming through it.  I like it as a reference book and it is so well written that I can picture and hear the characters faces and voices as the scenes unfold.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Had a good balance of humor and adventure. I added this movie to my permanent library without any question as soon as Amazon released it on Instant Video.
B008XKSW7M|2.0|I watched this hoping for some light humor but instead got a mish mosh of silly and dramatic scenarios that wastes the talents of a fine cast.
0385349947|5.0|Affirms the discrimination you suspect but can't put your finger on...definitely made me think twice about self-identifying when applying for jobs online.  Does not touch issues that are unique and specific to women of color, but author admits this early in the book.  I found all of her remarks to be very valuable---even those that I didn't agree with!
B0091VTISO|4.0|Our Vizio TV (also purchased at Amazon) is equipped with Wi-Fi and direct connection to Amazon Video. Because of this I subscribed to Prime and have never been sorry.<br />This movie is terrific, and would recommend it for viewing....I'm just still so impressed with Amazon streaming!!
B00CE379IM|3.0|Although I liked the movie, it in no way compared to the series of books.  There were a lot of things that were totally different and they condensed 7 books into one movie, instead of making a series of movies like the &#34;Twilight&#34; series.  I was very disappointed in that aspect-however the picture and quality of the film as related to playing it on the Kindle HD Fire was very good.  I don't blame Kindle-just the writers and producers of this movie which could have been SO MUCH BETTER.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good book that keeps you in suspense until the end. Surprise ending that will make you examine the bond between a parent and child.
B00COMLLX2|5.0|Love the ease of learning how to play and the graphics and colors of the game.  Love all types of computer pinball games, but so far this is the best.
B009MYARIK|4.0|I read the book this weekend and found it to be funny - a light summer read.  I enjoyed all of the characters and found myself chuckling at their antics (especially the young boy and the two sisters).  As the plot took shape I wondered what would happen and enjoyed reading the book to find out the ending.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I launched the app and downloaded the extra content and such, but after the checking for updates screen, it will say I'm not connected to the Internet, even though I have a 4 out of 4 bar Internet strength! I got what I payed for; nothing.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love being able to just grab my phone and read anywhere i want! Great app and its free! Love Love!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My fiancee and I loved the books, but hated the first movie. I recommend the kindle form of these books and the material.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I messed up and need to revise...I had not finished the prior levels in order to advance without paying.  My review is now 5 stars, the game does not disappoint!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Terrific story, better movie, a pure vision to behold. I'm not a huge Ang Lee fan (the director). I did love this movie. It sparked my creative imagination. That's the best we can hope a movie to do.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|Tom Cruise who, imho, hasn't actually acted since what - Risky Business maybe?  Has now ruined what could've been quite a lucrative series of movies by allowing his gigantic ego to take over any possible logical decisions.<br /><br />In EVERY single book and there are 17 - not including short stories - Reacher is described as:  \\"Reacher is 6'5\\" tall (1.96 m) with a 50-inch chest, and weighing between 220 and 250 pounds (100-115 kg). He has ice-blue eyes and dirty blond hair. He has very little body fat, and his muscular physique is completely natural (he reveals in Persuader, he has never been an exercise enthusiast). He is exceptionally strong, has a high stamina, but is not a good runner.\\"  His size is a significant factor in the stories - he can physically do the fantastic things depicted in the books because he's so ginormous.  Things that tiny little Tommy Cruise could never pull off - no matter how much he wanted to.<br /><br />Cruise could've chosen to produce and even appear in a cameo in all 17 movies (and more to come, Mr. Child hasn't stopped writing these novels); found the RIGHT Reacher and launched the American 007 (as in a long series of movies - not comparing characters or content) - he could've profited off the series well into his old age.<br /><br />Instead, he's made this ridiculous farce of a film that likely has soured the movie-going audience to this wonderful character all together.<br /><br />Smooth one there, Tommy Boy.<br /><br />As a long time reader of the books, I'm disappointed in Mr. Child, but am hopeful that what he thought the movie would be was not how it turned out and that his positive comments on the movie were due to contractual obligations - because Reacher fans know it's a piece of s***.<br /><br />Don't bother seeing this movie - the books are the equivalent of an action movie in print.  They're fun, exciting, a bit of mystery, a bit of secksay time - the whole package.  This movie does none of that justice.<br /><br />Hopefully someone will be smart enough to find the right Reacher, start the series with the first book and allow movie goers the opportunity to enjoy Reacher stories as much as the fans of the books do.<br /><br /> /end rantcher, start the series with the first book and allow movie goers the opportunity to enjoy Reacher stories as much as the fans of the books do.     /end rant
0767817664|3.0|This movie did not age well. I loved when I first saw it on cable. Was going to lend it to a friend, to share this great movie. Watching it now it’s like OMG, I am not lending this to anyone. Ashamed I liked it. Still loved Charlie Brewster and the other characters, but the seduction scenes were creepy, the music was ridiculous.<br />  My other guilty pleasure is much better: Disturbing Behavior

B00A7W29BE|5.0|This is a must have in the &#34;Utility Tools&#34; folders.  Sometimes making a &#34;copy&#34; of something is crucial and if you have no copier or scanner this is a great fill in.  The &#34;scan&#34; is clear and while not perfect, the tools within the app allow you to clean up the image.  If you cannot fit a printer/scanner in your phone or tablet (and most of us cannot) this is a great resource.

B002GZQYMK|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums. Muse's latest work, and probably their best so far. Almost every song is memorable, though they do get politically whiney... kind of a lot! But, their music is 'delicious'. I seriously love it. Definitely worth buying for any Muse or general music fan.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|Django unchained was exactly what i was hoping for from Quintin Terantino...a complete story, some great &#34;special effects&#34; and no nonsense. Christoph Waltz is the man (and yet again won another best supporting actor role), and DiCaprio can play any role it seems (even while bleeding, and should have won something...), and Jamie Foxx was surprizingly excellent. All in all an amazing movie.

B00915G6WQ|5.0|Dexter occupies amongst adult dramas on television nowadays.  Often dismissed as too \\"campy\\" or \\"nerdy\\" by serious television critics, the show has been hiding in the relative anonymity of Showtime for seven seasons.  And, following an excellent Season 4 marked by John Lithgow's chilling performance and a stunning death in the final episode, even the diehard Comic-Con fans would admit that Seasons 5 and 6 were not all that strong.  Season 5 explored Dexter's insecurities about being a single father, only to more or less abandon that plot by bringing on a scantily-clad Aimee Garcia as Harrison's full-time babysitter and de-facto-mother.  Season 6 had some moments (and big payoff in the final scene), but the writing of Colin Hanks' character made him into a flimsy and ridiculous adversary.<br /><br />(SPOILERS follow this portion of the review - you shouldn't be reading here anyway if you don't want to be spoiled :)<br /><br />Season 7 opens where Season 6 closed - Deb has gone to the church to confess her real, not-so-brotherly love for Dexter, and instead walks in on him performing a ritualized murder.  I appreciated that they only spent one episode with Deb coming to the full realization that Dexter is a serial killer, and undoubtedly, the most prolific serial killer in American history.<br /><br />Jennifer Carpenter's performance as \\"Deb\\" has always been a high point of the show, but she OWNS this season.  Frankly, as much as we've seen Dexter grown and change over six years, there's only so much mileage to be had out of his redundant monologues.  The fact that Deb now knows what Dexter is, what she chooses to do with that information, and the way it destroys her emotionally is very intriguing new element to the show, and one that will undoubtedly continue into the 8th and final season.<br /><br />Yvonne Strahovski's role as \\"Hannah McKay\\" was another good addition to the show.  While her character was not always interesting, she provided the most interesting romantic partner for Dexter since Rita, and possibly ever.  It was also a role that got better as the season went on as we got to see more of Hannah's dark side, and her character became less one-dimensional.<br /><br />Some fans might lament the absence of a true \\"Big Bad\\" from start to finish, but the Ukrainian mob angle set the tone for much of the season, and it could be argued that Laguerta's investigation of Dexter and Deb made her the \\"Big Bad\\" for Season 7.  There were still the usual shortcuts in logic, and lazily constructed plotlines, but this is not a police procedural, a la \\"The Wire\\".  Season 7 was excellent, and opens the door for a fantastic finale to what I have always found to be a clever, thrilling, and innovative show.ntic partner for Dexter since Rita, and possibly ever.

B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Daft Punk took on a very different style with this album, at first I was a little worried but I ended up very impressed. There are a few songs on this album that I do not care for but the better tracks make up for it entirely. The standout tracks of this album would be :<br /><br />Motherboard<br />Give life back to music<br />Lose yourself to dance<br />Get lucky<br />Doin' it Right<br /><br />Motherboard in my opinion is worth the whole album, must have listened to it about 50 times already.
B004H4XI5O|4.0|The title of this book will not make any sense until you have read Chapter Five, \\"The Memory Palace,\\" which describes how mnemonists use the technique of imagined loci, places associated with vivid images, to help them remember such unmemorable things as random number strings, cards in a deck, and people's names. The subtitle is what advertizes the subject of this book. (When authors, or probably more accurately, publishers, use an obscure phrase or reference for a book title, shouldn't they at least make the more explanatory subtitle more prominent on the cover?)<br />Joshua Foer is a young journalist writing stories for online magazines like Slate, when he gets assigned to cover the 2005 U.S. Memory Championship in Manhattan. There he meets a number of top-ranked mnemonists, sort of mental athletes who specialize in unbelievable memory feats, like Ed Cooke, a grand master from England. Since he was not a U.S. citizen, Cooke attended the competition as a sort of spring training; his scores would not be counted.<br />Thus, begins the author's yearlong (actually several years long, because it led to the writing of this book) journey into the world of memory extremes. As he delves into the intricacies of memory and how the human brain works, Foer finds himself getting gradually pulled into the intoxication of memory competition. He meets more competitors, many in their twenties like him and living at home with their parents because their involvement in memory competitions makes it impossible to hold down steady jobs. (They travel the world to memory competitions in distant places, spending vast amounts of time in training and looking for income to support their peripatetic lives.) A few have found ways to make lots of money, like the 67-year-old British memory guru, Tony Buzan, who has established memory competitions in more than a dozen countries. But one idea all these competitors impress on Foer is that anyone, with proper training and dedication, can become a memory champion. So Foer takes up the challenge and agrees, with the help of Ed Cooke as coach, to train for the next U.S. Memory Championship.<br />This book is partly a record of Foer's year of struggles to prepare himself for the competition and partly an overview of the history of mnemonics or memory training and partly a look at the science of how memory functions in both the normal and the abnormal human brain. The abnormal or injured human brain is exemplified in the story of EP, a man who suffered through the assault of the virus, herpes simplex, and was left with debilitating amnesia. EP's brain cannot form any new memories and cannot recall any old memories from after 1950. Foer visits EP at home and finds that \\"each time [EP] greets his wife, it's as though he hasn't seen her in twenty years.\\"<br />At the other end of the extreme are the memory savants, like Kim Peek, made famous by the movie Rain Man with actor Dustin Hoffman. Peek was born with macrocephaly and was kept on sedatives for the first fourteen years of his life. When he was taken off drugs, he soon started to show an interest in books and with memorizing their contents. His memory skills are now almost legendary, but so are his disabilities. He has memorized all of the works of Shakespeare. Once, while attending a live performance of Twelfth Night, he noticed that an actor had transposed two lines of the play. Peek threw such a raucous fit, that the play had to be stopped while he was escorted from the theatre. Subsequently, he was no longer allowed to attend such live performances. But he has an IQ of only 87! Such are a few of the mysteries of memory and the human brain that Foer uncovers in his year of training.<br />While doing his research, Foer, always under Cooke's guidance, continues to improve---to such an extent that he begins to believe that he might be a serious challenger for the U.S. Championship. (It should be noted that, because he lives across the \\"pond,\\" most of Cooke's coaching is done long range, by phone and email. But he contacts Foer several times a week to monitor and guide his trainee's preparation.) Foer keeps the suspense going throughout the book as the day of competition draws closer. (This review will not reveal the outcome of this contest.) In this way he keeps the book moving along even as he delves ever deeper into the history and science of memory.<br />I did find Chapter Six, \\"How to Memorize a Poem,\\" to be a disappointment. What drew me to this book in the first place is my little hobby of memorizing poems. At this point I have about 15 poems in my memory bank. I got them in there by brute force: reciting, reciting, reciting the lines of each poem over and over again, until I had them by rote, word for word, in whatever back channel of the brain holds those things that you just never seem to forget, that you can recall effortlessly, like some prayer or song taught to you as a child. I don't know an easier or faster way to get a poem in my memory and was hoping to get some ideas from this book. But this chapter does not really tell you how to memorize a poem although it does give some approaches for dealing with abstract words, like \\"duty\\" or \\"honor,\\" and so-called structure terms like \\"and\\" and \\"from.\\" So this chapter does not live up to the promise of its title. Maybe that's because there is no fast and easy way to memorize poetry. Even for the champion mnemonists who appear in this book, the poetry event is the most dreaded of all. In fact, we find that---perhaps under pressure of some fearsome mnemonist lobby---the poetry event was eventually eliminated from international competition. How sad! Why else would you want to develop a championship-level memory but to be able to recall in an instant a powerful thought beautifully written? OK. My bias is hereby confessed.

B00BHU2A7I|2.0|This is the worst performance I've ever seen Anthony Hopkins give. I really didn't believe he could do a bad role, but he just didn't make me believe he was Alfred Hitchcock for a minute. It all seemed contrived and silly. I was particularly put off by the scenes where the imaginary boogie man wanders around and talks to him. A waste of time, in my opinion.

Great insights into how women sabotage their own efforts and great insight into ways to feel empowered as a woman in the work place. Have recommended to a number of friends and requested my husband read it as well. Thoroughly enjoyed!
B008LY9AWG|4.0|Connelly always paints the perfect picture of his characters. Even in these short stories, you know exactly who each person is until at the last minute, something changes and you get surprised. This just supports how well Michael Connelly knows human nature. He always leaves you wanting to read more.  Definitely worth the time to read these stories.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I absolutely love this movie & it is my favorite out of all the Harry Potter series .. lots of action & emotional moments! As much as this movie made me happy, I am also sad to see this series end. It was a one of a kind, adventurous experience & I really admire the great talent of all the actors in the Harry Potter series, as well as J. K. Rowlings for her amazing writing ability & spectacular imagination. Cheers to you all!

B009NY43NY|2.0|As a fan of the series I was looking forward to how Harris would wrap up the series. Unfortunately, the series has been lacking the heat and excitement it had early on. The final book wrapped up Sookie's  story in a way that was just blah.  It was just straight up lame.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Ok now I have had a few days to really get used to this mouse.<br /><br />Pros.<br />-Anywhere from 200 to 8000 DPI Configurations<br />-4 Customizable DPI amounts<br />-2 Profile and button on bottom for easy switching.<br />-Extremely Comfortable fit<br />-Plenty of buttons<br />-Quality cable.<br /><br />Cons.<br />-The software could be tricky if you had never used something of the like.<br />-If the computer turns off the lights stay on (Doesn't bother me)<br />-The wheel doesn't change colors (personally I like the two tone)<br /><br />Honestly for the price, you get this great mouse and the Anker Name. I haven't seen a decent weight system on a mouse this cheap in a long time. I think the Basic product image makes it look to round. Its actually pretty long, and looks more like a gaming mouse. I have two profiles set up, one for media, and one for gaming. Different colors for each. The media is convenient for changing songs and stop and play. Gaming is precise and wonderful. It takes some playing around to get the DPI right but once you do its great.
B007KQ6XYY|1.0|It has to have WiFi to play, it won't turn on, and instead of waiting Money on it just play on the test drive because you have to have WiFi. The game itself is awesome in the test drive. If it could open I think I would be great other than the WiFi fact.

B000FA675C|4.0|Dan Brown is an interesting writer.<br /><br />When I was younger (and hadn't tried to write much myself) I didn't like him. After trying my hand at it, I think I've changed my mind.<br /><br />He does use some cheap tricks - for example - an albino evildoer. But I use my own cheap tricks, so that's that.<br /><br />The professor protagonist is also a bit gimmicky, though it clearly does serve its purpose of getting the reader up to speed on focused knowledge that might be difficult to convey otherwise.<br /><br />Brown has done his research and it shows. That's one of the things that makes the book a rewarding read even where its execution doesn't sit 100% with me.<br /><br />I do wonder if you couldn't distill the knowledge here and in the Lost Symbol and have a more complex story - where the characters interpret the \\"clues\\" less literally. Sometimes (okay - often) the literalness and the lack of ambiguity in the characters interpretation of the clues/adventure they've set out on makes me feel like it is a Scooby-Doo episode.<br /><br />Also - both the Da Vinci Code & The Lost Symbol, feel to me as if the protagonist Langdon has actually missed the point entirely and only claps at fool's gold by the novel's close . . . maybe that's just me? I don't know . . .<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT -- For example - it seemed to me that the obvious conclusion would be that Sophie is the living grail, and Langdon doesn't really get there.<br /><br />I sometimes wonder if that's Brown's intent? Hiding mystical knowledge in plain view, in a popular format . . .<br /><br />If that's the case, then he's a genius!<br /><br />Either way, despite stylistic complaints aside, the book is a page turner. I can't deny that!
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I was really happy with this little movie. I never read the books. After the mess that was The Blood and Chocolate movie a few years back I chose not to read them. I thought the movie was well acted, having been born and raised in the south I know it can be hard to pick up on the southern drawl. All the actors did so quite well. I am the first to admit that the southern accent sounds leeps and bounds different from those in the rest of the country and it is a hard one to pick up. I say this because of some reviews complaining about it. Yes we do really talk like that. We drop our 'r' and lengthen our o's and such. Now as for the feel and look at the movie it was very very good. I think the movie itself as a stand alone is great and that many people giving it bad reviews are those angry because it is so different than the book. And I understand after watching Blood and Chocolate i wanted to pitch my dvd player out the window, but Blood and chocolate was a good book turned into a bad movie in general. Beautiful Creatures is actually a good movie. So if you can get past that it is not like the book or if you have never read the book like myself it is very much worth the watch. The acting is dead on the cinematography is lovely and the story was good with an interesting plot. It is extremely unfair to give this movie a bad review just because it differs from the book simply because as a movie it is one of the best in its genre i have seen in a very long time.

B00138H68M|5.0|This album is the soundtrack to my summertime. It's a mixture of pop-punk and garage rock stylings, and it's all wrapped up in a 1970's vibe. The sexual themes of the album are sung in a wonderfully sarcastic tone by Casablancas, whose voice oozes power and confidence. Tis album is all about them, in a lovingly sarcastic way. It's an album that says \\"hey, we're The Strokes, we're here, and if you don't like it, go to hell!\\"
B00CATSONE|2.0|This book features some bullet points on Tesla's life, but on the whole it feels less like a book and more like a pamphlet to sell a self help program.
B00136LVWQ|5.0|This album is an amazing example of what two guitars played by two un-selfish, seasoned professionals can sound like. Albert's clean strat tones are at a peak of greatness on this album. Valensi's lead melodies drip with overdrive, like on the song \\"You talk Way Too Much.\\" The two balance eachother out perfectly. All strokes fans have their favorite guitarist, personally mine is Albert, but with Nick Valensi, there'd be no balance in the band. They both are key parts in the Strokes sound.
B003QSMC18|4.0|I rented The Princess and The Frog for my daughter who is four and she watched the movie like four times. Beautiful !!!
B006P7IFKY|5.0|I've listened to this album over and over for years, and I'm still not tired of hearing it. The vocals are perfect, the lyrics are genius, the guitar and bass work is perfectly balanced, and the drums, not usually a focal point for the Strokes, are incredible in this album, Moretti really hit the nail on the head on this one. Songs like Ize Of The World, Fear Of Sleep, and Juicebox I think are inspired a lot by Casablancas' drug use. When listening to the chorus of Ize Of The World, there's a point of anticipation where the snare is played on every beat, and Casablancas' voice is in the bottom of his low register, and then, you hear Casablancas' burst out an octave up, only for a short period, almost reminiscent of a headrush.<br /><br />The record is very symbolic of the human condition, and touches base on our (sometimes messed up) values and morals:  sex and drugs, love, and laziness. There's a very big sense of honesty throughout the record.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The author repeats again and again the same. Keeps your curiosity but nothing more that could be valuable. Didn´t like the ending.
B00BUL0XYG|5.0|Firstly, I love the album art for this record: a way to stick it to RCA that they no longer belong to them. This was the last of five records in their RCA contract, and the fact that they plastered RCA all over it while they're thrilled to be done really strikes me as funny.<br /><br />Secondly, the music is some of the best Strokes I've ever heard. Tap Out is a beautiful, harmonic, Angles-esque song that showcases the tremendous voice of Julian Casablancas. His voice has just gotten better and better with every record.<br /><br />One Way Trigger would be a song The Strokes would release if they were an 80's Synthpop band; that being said, it's sheer perfection. The falsetto vocals are more than impressive.<br /><br />Welcome to Japan has some amazing stereo guitar work by Nick and Albert. They blend together beautifully. The lyrics are filled with that classic sarcasm and cynicism that Casablancas has in his songwriting, and it's oh so funny, but heart wrenching at the same time.<br /><br />50/50 sounds like a single from the Is This It era, such a great little throwback Strokes song. You get the overdriven vocals, the slightly unbalanced sound of the guitars over the other instruments, and the classic 2/4 beat from Fab'.<br /><br />80's Comedown Machine is a beautiful, reverb filled epic, that sounds alot like Julians solo record.<br /><br />Call it Fate, Call it Karma is a vocally undecipherable, cosmic sounding epic, and is a perfect way to end the record.<br /><br />The last song to mention is my favorite from the record, and that is without a second guess Slow Animals. There aren't enough nice things for me to say about this song. It brought me to tears during the pre-chorus.<br /><br />If you're reading this, buy this record, support this band.
B0067EKYS6|4.0|If you've watched Redford's performance as Jay Gatsby you know going into this movie that Leonardo DiCaprio has a lot to live up to in this role. I enjoyed the version with Redford in it. And I enjoyed Moulin Rouge! So a Baz Lurhrman version of the story sounded like something that would remake the mold of Hollywood's Gatsby.<br /><br />First off : This is no Moulin Rouge! There is flash and bling and lovely posed shots and beautiful setting and velvet and gold but the over the top luxuriant performances from Moulin Rouge are nowhere to be seen. Even the frantic pseudo flapper parties are nowhere near the madness of Moulin in celebration. The soundtrack is nowhere near the brilliance of Moulin either and makes an appearance too far in between.<br /><br />But this isn't meant to be Moulin Rouge and you figure that very quickly. The story does not stray too far from the original but the performances from the actors are really exceptional. The leading pair are absolutely wonderful in their interpretation of Daisy Buchanan and Jay Gatsby. DiCaprio manages to be vulnerable and slightly dangerous without the aloof, slightly snooty, persona that Redford infused the character with. DiCaprio is much more believable as the Gatsby of the book. Carey Mulligan's Daisy too is a much more nuanced character in this movie than Mia Farrow's constantly frenetic, slightly unbalanced performance. If anyone appears to be mildly unbalanced here, it is Gatsby with his brave and unrealistic dreams that eerily border on obsession. A scene that stood out in this movie as a definite improvement over Coppola's version was the shirt throwing scene where Farrow comes across as just plain cuckoo whereas Mulligan is a woman in mourning for what might have been.<br /><br />The movie does fall flat in the choice of Tobey Maguire as the narrator and witness to all the madness. Sam Waterston's performance as the outsider observer was much better than the naïve young fool that Maguire plays that seems to have not an ounce of wit or drive behind him. Waterston was able to portray the contempt he felt for Daisy and her sort while Maguire wallows in depression and misery. The whole idea of having Nick go off the deep end and end up in a Sanitarium is  bit morose and over the top.<br /><br />So, there are some gaps to this movie but the leading stars give solid performances. To fans of Gatsby this movie will not be perfect but, frankly, with the star power and the beautiful filming, it would be wonderful if this movie drew a newer generation to the world of Fitzgerald and Gatsby and Daisy and Nick Carraway.to have not an ounce of wit or drive behind him.

B00CRS88IO|5.0|A fast paced and exciting read, completed in a day and a half.  I remember reading that Sean Connery had said that he would have rather played Ian Fleming as he had a more interesting life than his creation Bond.  I am glad he didn't but this book does provide a glimpse into what the actual world of Fleming must have been like.  I have read all the Fleming Bond books and enjoyed each of them. Damian has captured some of the greatest attributes of the books and writes very much like him.  The book was like fitting on an old familiar glove when I read it.<br /><br />Damian intertwines themes and notions of Fleming's in a manner that is believable that it made an impression on him at the time.  Like old friends they appear at various times and gave me chuckles when I tied them together.  His villains are also believable not the &#34;Jaws&#34; character that appeared in Roger Moore's comic book version of 007.  His scenes in London and the offices are very reminiscent of Bond's future life.  And the book is complete with the love interests, Damian's Fleming learned the ropes well.<br /><br />All in all an excellent read if you want to journey into the original secret agent genre!

B004USLWVE|5.0|I love the bag, and I got it thinking it would hold everything I have. It ALMOST does. The problem lies in the open compartment in the top, but that problem is mine, and not one with the bag. If you have one or two bodies, and three or four lenses, it would be great for you. You can only hold three lenses if you have a zoom the size of the 70-200, but four if you have primes or smallers zooms that are able to sit upright. I have three bodies, all full frame (so they're a bit larger), and six lenses and two flashes with about thirty eneloop batteries. I am using every single bit of space this bag has, and the top compartment is holding loosely my flashes and one camera body and one lens. I have my 85L sitting on top of my 70-200 backwards down in the bottom part. Probably not too safe, but I'm looking into Pelicans now. I LOVE the laptop zipper on the back. I LOVE the compartments everywhere. This is truly a fantastic bag, and I have no regrets buying it. I think I will keep it so when I travel the world, I'll have a bag that holds a couple of bodies, a few lenses, a laptop, and some toys for the kiddo in the top. I've never used this as a sling, and while I guess I could, I think I just have it so full that it's so dang heavy I just don't want to. Hope this helps!

B00C5GZKVQ|2.0|This game has a really limited market in my opinion. I got it because it was the free app of the day, and it looked fairly interesting. It's functional and it's playable, but not in anyway interesting. The game is really just a bunch of flying around environments that look like your house, shooting horribly animated bullets and missiles that do nothing to the background but explode in an instant unsatisfying blip.<br /><br />I recommend this game ONLY to people who are extremely into remote control helicopters, and even then not very highly. It's bland and only the controls are little more than acceptable. For free I guess it would be worth a try, but I wouldn't pay a penny for it.
B008P9M614|5.0|I had previously owned two of the individual seasons of House and tried to watch it while it was on, but the date/time was never great for me.  I loved the show from the beginning; when I got married, it fell to my watching priority list because my husband had never really watched it and by that time it was season 7 and he wasn't going to pick it up so late in the game.<br /><br />Fast forward 3 years.  While browsing one morning, I see that the complete series is the gold box deal.  The price was great and since I missed the last 2 1/2 seasons (but heard they were fabulous), I really wanted to pick it back up.<br /><br />The packaging is ok.  All of the seasons are individually housed; together they are kept in a box.  A number of the little plastic bits that hold the DVDs in the packaging were broken, so some of them slide around a bit.  I actually  have to store mine sideways to reduce disc movement.  That doesn't bother me a lot.  It's more annoying than anything.<br /><br />The series itself is fantastic.  I started over at season one and found that I enjoy the episodes just as much as I did the first time I saw them.  Some I remember, some I don't.  Some I think I missed altogether the first time around.  My husband started watching it with me and he's hooked.  He is impressed with the attention to detail and character.  The plot lines are always interesting.  While each episode (at least the first few seasons) could, in theory, be watched individually, the writers do a good job of keeping short sub-plots woven throughout the series.  Most of them only last 5-6 episodes so they don't get tedious.

B00AWJYJVA|4.0|Le Carre' is getting predictable in his old age , much to our enjoyment<br />The decent ,if slightly old fashioned ,Senior Civil servant,the Nouveau powerful populist  Minister of the Crown,the principled ex SAS soldier ,the private contractors for dirty jobs in the Secret Service black operations world,and finally ,the solitary ,bright,low class,diplomat and ideologue, are all there.<br />The elegy for an establishment that is not what it was continues<br />The plot is basic ,but so is the plot of a Greek Tragedy.Terrorism,the emergence of private contractors in Defence and Intelligence ,the mutation of the Secret Service game,the increasing brutality of the Governing Political Class.the increasing difficulty and/or unwillingness of the Civil Service to control its Political Masters,all the above are the canvas of the book.<br />Among all this the solitary moral man, the Hero of the novel emerges for the Good Fight<br />The whole Business Venture posing as Government in Tony Blair's Laborite times is dissected and laid bare in this pitiless but fascinating novel.<br />A sort of Catharsis takes place but I am not going to reduce the potential readers pleasure by going further,the Author does the real thing much better.<br />The superb prose is as good as ever if not better,the Neo realism is of course in a very English style,the sarcasm is sad and subdued as befits a Member of the Establishment that repudiates it.<br />The admirable psychological portraits of the characters and their interplay are as masterly as ever<br />The characters are not merely sketched but sculpted painted and animated by that great anatomist of the English Psyche<br />Not his best book but one of them.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's the greatest book ever written and has the answers to all of life's most important questions if you are willing to take the time to find out what God's plan is for you and for all of mankind.  It is wonderful to be able to access absolute truth that can be relied upon and through God's word and the gift of His son have absolute assurance of eternal life.  It's a great resource.

0061950726|5.0|I found the subject of this book to be fascinating. I can't imagine being a young child riding the rails, unsure of what my future holds. This book offered an interesting look at what life may have been like for those children. Furthermore, I found myself wanting to seek out more books on the subject because Vivian's tale captivated me so much. I found the character of Molly to be less interesting, but even still it was interesting to learn about where she came from. It would have been nice if she was flushed out a bit more; I felt like I didn't really know her. Overall, I recommend this book.
0525423842|2.0|While all fiction requires a certain level of suspension of belief, this book pushed the limits for me.  While many 13 year olds believe they know it all and school really serves no purpose, Theodore Boone being the only son of 2 lawyers really pushes this feeling beyond all limits.  I am happy that I withheld purchase of the others in this series until I finally had a chance to read this first one.  Definitely will not be reading the others.

I got about 1/2 through (and that was tough), when a friend in the book club asked &#34;did you finish it yet?&#34; My reply was &#34;not yet, I'm about 1/2 way through, please tell me it gets better?&#34;. His reply was &#34;Ok, stop reading it. It gets worse&#34;. I stopped and never looked back. The author owes me about 2 weeks of my life back! How do these things get published?

Despite narrating differences, I think the movie conveyed the \\"main\\" story well---cruel dictatorship in Panem and oppression in 12 districts. Violence during the Game was soften too, considering how it happened in the book.<br /><br />However, the movie left out a lot of backgrounds and relationships. I started the book because there were things in the movie that I needed to fill the blank. For example, Katniss' father wasn't mentioned earlier in the movie; he just popped up when Katniss recalled his death. I found out from the book that he gave her skills to survive---hunting, trading, finding edible plants, etc. Moreover, her relationship with her father and his death shaped Katniss characteristics.<br /><br />To me, this story (and the whole series)is a complete version of Battle Royale. If you could see the point of the story, I think it's a good movie to watch. If you think it's purely violent, steer clear from it. Either way, I won't let young kids watch this movie.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I originally read this in my youth as a freshman in HS.  It was one of the first books that really moved me, I read it in three short days (also a first).  The characters are memorable and interesting, the plot is both deep and interesting.  Read thee book and enjoy it - even if you have already read it once before. I enjoyed it more the second time for sure.
0670026557|5.0|The books is in fine condition and it arrived prompIy. I heard an interview with Adam Grant on the NPR and was moved to order the book for my summer reading.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|So much more to love than all the other build it, zoo-type games out there.  You are able to collect numerous specimens quickly, and build up coins and game dollars quickly too.  You have the option of buying coins or game dollars with real Money, or with minimal patience, you CAN earn them.  Costs for items are not so outrageous you have to wait forever to save up to buy them.  In addition to the care and feeding of your Jurassic &quot;pets&quot;, there are also the totally fun &quot;missions&quot; to complete, which keeps this game so interesting--you never get bored!  Once you reach level 10, there is a freakin' awesome surprise in store.  You can't go wrong with this download, especially at the low, low price of FREE!  If you are tired of all the everyday, soon to be boring build it zoo fare out there, you have got to try this.  BTW, I have not experienced one crash or lock up since I got this.  Enjoy!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|A fun blend of a caretaker and action app. I can't put it down even though war usually get boring after a while for me.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Good characters and arresting plots.  Especially good at presenting strong female characters.  Relationships provide good tension, and the machinations of politics and the law are expertly intermingled.

B009XIXVU6|3.0|In Afghanistan in 1952 a brother and sister are torn apart in an emotional and beautifully written beginning to a novel that spans 58 years.  The rest of the book goes back and forth through the decades, telling stories of the siblings and the people who touch their lives.  Some of the stories are more interesting and more believable than others.  But the overall unrelieved sadness that permeates this book ruined it for me.  This is an extraordinarily depressing novel and, frankly, I wish I'd never read it.
B001BANK32|5.0|I love this book, it is one of the scariest horror books I have ever read and will definitely creep you out. The writing is very good, and I would recommend it to anyone.
B00CFQN12Q|5.0|I wouldn't call this the best Die Hard film. But I would say this is the best action film of them all. My advice is don't take it too seriously and enjoy the action. If you don't expect top of the line dialog and the best acting of all time then you will enjoy it. But if you expect those things then you will set yourself up for disappointment. This movie has a lot of action and things that don't make sense that it will make you laugh. I loved it and if you don't like it please recognized that with sequels, it could have been worst.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A lovely narrative. Exquisite writing. Beautiful phrases.<br /> EXTRAORDINARY Characterization.  Imaginative storytelling.  A weaving  of connecting tales. Author has triumphed again.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I should start off by sayings I'm an app snob! I'm ADD and not easily amused.This app has managed to stay in my ohone for months! That says a lot! I get on and play whenever I'm bored of whatever NEW app has caught my eye and it's always my fail-safe. It is missing that element of addiction, but hey, maybe that's a good thing.
B001NLL8LA|2.0|The title says it all. This book should be gone tomorrow, I know I'll forget it tomorrow, but it is 10 times better than the previous.
B00BF11STU|4.0|The only problem I had with this movie was the Seal team was hesitant to go.  I don't believe for one second any special forces unit would pass up any opportunity to go on any mission!
B002ZG974M|4.0|I really enjoyed this documentary.  It shows four very different upbringings of four very happy babies.  Each situation is so different from the next, yet each child is loved, nurtured, happy, and has all their basic needs met. Some are quite priveleged, some are quite content with drinking from a water hole and playing in the dirt.  The mamas are all laid back and confident in their own way. I loved seeing the different culture's way of doing things.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Unbelievable!  I don't believe this movie was shot in a studio.  I think they must have used a time machine and gone back to the actual occurrence!  Sally Fields was unbelievably good as Mrs. Lincoln.  Daniel Day-Lewis channels Lincoln.  A perfect movie.
B0028DRGDQ|5.0|Most scary movies aren't scary unless they go into the \\"messed up\\" genre that is disturbing and hard to watch. This avoids that, is just good ol' fashioned horror fun, and is quite scary. Would recommend!
B000WAEK0E|1.0|I orderd Van Morrison's Greatest Hits and got 2-of 3 CD's. Then was asked to ship it back and it is not their problem order from another supplier. that is why the internet in the black hole!
B00459EZLW|5.0|By season 2 the characters in Stargate Universe had developed to the point where I had real empathy for them.  The premise for the series is a group of earthlings who ended up on a million year old Ancient spaceship.  Survival was a constant struggle due to limited supplies and the poor condition of the ship.  This was made worse by infighting and attacks from outside forces.  Meanwhile my favorite character, Dr. Rush, was trying to figure out the ship's mission.  Perhaps the biggest reason that this series didn't catch on well enough to stick around was that the people had very human failings.  Although several characters were larger than life, there was no perfect genius hero who always saved the day.  One failing of the series was resorting to deus ex machina a bit too often.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|Whatever the one star reviews say, this book is totally not boring. I didn't even like this type of book, but since I read Shiver I do! This book is great for people who have a good sense of adventure.
B0037MNKDC|2.0|I loved the books (well, most of them, anyway - not so much the newer ones, sadly), so the show should have been awesome, right? WRONG :P<br />The charm of the books is completely lacking in this show. I was astonished because I have loved other work by Alan Ball so much, like American Beauty & Six Feet Under. But this show's a dud. It's NOTHING like the books, so sad.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|I LOVE how you get to feed om and his ancestors the candy. I also like the challenges you have to face to get all the stars
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Excellent graphics in this game!  Great storyline that is easy to follow.  The only complaint that I have with this game is that it is way too short!  It only had taken me a few hours to complete it.  Some of the puzzles are a little challenging but great game overall.
B000PAAH3K|2.0|Boring, I read it with my son and although I found it more interesting than he I cannot believe they want these 12th graders to read this and then do a final exam on it.<br />Boring!
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I really love this game. I do really think you should try this app. I got introduced to this game by my friend, and I liked it so I got it on my kindle. You should try.

B008YWY0HK|4.0|I did not see this in theaters because it just did not look that interesting. I also didn't think it would hold the attention of my 4 yr old daughter. Wrong on both counts. This is a great movie. Not top 5 all time or anything, but good. I will say the Scottish accents got a bit old after a while. Sounded kind of phony to me. Overall B+.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I've found this game enjoyable and didn't mind spending my time on it. I would recommend it.  Have fun, I know I did.
0823003035|1.0|No Old Master drew using the \\"envelope\\" or \\"box-in\\" approach. They were not afraid to attempt to draw the curved contours at once, quicker, and this left them more time to draw more and place their figures in imaginary scenes, and actually make art.  This new constipated way to draw must be a product<br />of the overrated Art Students League of New York. If you try and draw this way, you will probably be able to draw<br />still life and people plopped right in front of you realistically. If that is your goal, fine. But Rubens never<br />drew like that. Nor did Titian or Leonardo or any great draftsman.  That's because they had imaginations, and wanted<br />to do more than draw models sitting before them in hyperreal style.<br /><br />Ryder is not an artist--Google his \\"paintings\\" and see what you find.  He is just a drawing instructor, and he<br />mostly just does drawing in this tight, constipated nerdy way. He has not shown he can draw from the imagination<br />whatsoever, and he cannot create a scene in pencil or paint.<br /><br />And just LOOK at the model's feet that are toward the viewer--they are oversized, just like a wide-angle camera!<br />I'm not saying he used a camera; I'm saying the man doesn't know how to discriminate and make artist's choices.<br />For him to call his book a \\"complete\\" manual using the \\"Classical\\" tradition is false advertising.<br /><br />If you want to learn how to draw like the Old Masters did, just use charcoal or chalk (not pencil) and draw from classical<br />busts, drapery, etc.  Draw the outline quickly but accurately as you can (no box-in!). Get the Lumen Picturae book.  Look at Old Master drawings, esp. Rubens, Watteau or even the sculptor<br />Bernini.  Not one of these masters drew using Ryder's tedious technique of non-discriminatory hyperrealism.

B00COGXGNQ|4.0|not what i thought it would be,im not one to cry at movies or a sucker for a good love story but this caught me totally by surprise,i did not see this coming,definitely worth watching over and over again.
B00COHIFQS|4.0|On the positive side, Mama creates a spooky atmosphere and the performances are good.  In particular, Jessica Chastain communicates the arc of her character in a most believable way.  the girls are good too, and I love how they mastered that crab-walk!<br /><br />Sadly, a lot of the movie doesn't made sense (e.g. why does the father have to be a twin?) and as the film moves to the end it becomes both silly and melodramatic.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|I really have enjoyed this cd. Wow Zac Brown is a great band with great voices and awesome playin. Really happy with this purchase
B00D2ZF3GQ|3.0|This review will probably be more flattering than deserved, due to my fondness for science fiction adventures. After Earth kept my attention, but I had to completely ignore the predictability (from M. Night? Who would have thought?). A reasonably decent Saturday matinée movie that owes more than a little to Jurassic Park. Yet unlike its paleolithic predecessor, After Earth is in the hands of M. Night who has forgotten how to adequately build suspense. A few of the shocks were 80s style horror movie jump cuts -- the cheapest way to get an audience's attention -- and frankly everyone will know how the story will end after watching the first twenty minutes.<br /><br />So no suspense, decent action. The acting? As a complete Will Smith fan, I have never seen a movie where his performance disappointed -- until this one. I know he had to play the stoic general/father, but there is a big difference between a stoic and a flat performance. Mr. Smith senior was reading dialog in a fashion more wooden than a bad high school play. Since the man knows how to act, the fault must lie with the script/director -- each of which were (surprisingly?) associated with M. Night. Jaden Smith is young and I hate to be unkind in my review of his acting. Let's just say that I hope he was as victimized as his father.<br /><br />I now believe Shymalan has exhausted his bag of tricks. The writing of this movie lacks, and he even borrows a bit of his foreshadowing techniques from Signs, although less effectively.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you enjoy a little questing adventure movie that has really nice cinematography, then go and have a good time. But your chances of finding a better movie than this are pretty high.
B008Q00BOQ|1.0|I found the movie too slow, and there was a lot of sexual innuendo, i dont mind this, but the whole first part involved the possiblity of the 2 main characters getting into bed. If the movie had a faster pace, I might have watched it in its entirety
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|The advertisement for this film was well done.  I intended to see it at the theater but somehow I missed it.  Unfortunately, the trailer had all of the best parts.  The story had a lot of promise, but fell short.  It was \\"OK\\" (I am not demanding my money or my time back) but it was not worth $3.99. I could have waited for it to come on cable or Amazon prime.  But if you are bored like I was today, it will entertain you for a couple of hours.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I found this book to be well written.  The characters were not &#34;handsome nor beautiful&#34;, but real people.  The peeks into the orphanage years were sad and disturbing.
B00498YZFK|3.0|Watched this over the weekend. I thought it was just ok. Jennifer Lawrence did a good job.  But the overall plot of the movie was too slow & uninteresting for me. I was actually doing other things while watching it.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|loved the special effects. I would like to see more movies made with magic and love in the mix. wonderful
B0089EHWQE|3.0|I wanted to like this book and I do...  The love story is very believable.  I can totally see how Lou and Will could have fallen in love with each other.  However, some of the characters feel very contrived.  Lou's family members are presented as happy, loving and accepting people even tho they struggle financially and are living in very tight quarters.  I get the feeling the author wanted to create the perfect family who focus on the right things but are just too poor, but there's not enough human flaws.  She gave them enough personality to be charming and slightly comical.  Will, too, was the perfect man before his accident.  He was independently wealthy by the age of 33.  He had traveled the world and partake in so many exciting and romantic travels and activities.  For a guy who spent so much time doing so many fun and wonderful things I wonder how he found the time to build a massively successful company.  If you built this successful business, you must have enjoyed that process, perhaps you can still work on it as a quad.  Since his business dealings weren't physically demanding.  It's feasible he could continue to have a fulfilling business career in spite of his handicap.  I know people who live with ALS which leaves them less physical functions than a quad, but they still work and find fulfillment in other aspects of life.  As I read the book, I could totally see a movie made by Hollywood to be the perfect romantic comedy with a tear jerker ending.  I do like the point made by Will that he no longer has a voice since the accident and he does have a choice when it comes to his life and the people who love him should respect that choice.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great movie with an amazing picture quality can't wait to see part 2 of this movie, amazon prime has a great selection of top movies!
B000HEWEE4|5.0|Awsom movie, when it first came out I watched it over and over. It's only now that I'm ordering this movie just to have it. I got this movie due to having the movie on tv now but it has commercial, so I bought the DVD. When ordering The dvd was given a free gift so I was able to watch this movie without commercials either on my iPad or my tv due to having the wii. It's great having a wii council.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|Do you like books that make you cry? I definitely do, and my house is now depleted of tissues thanks to Jojo Moyes' gripping Me Before You. *shakes fist at author* Talk about a book that makes you FEEL. I totally dived into the characters' lives, and I continue to feel gutted a day after finishing.<br /><br />Twenty-six-year-old Lou (Louisa) comes from a working-class family in small-town England. Other than an ancient castle attracting tourists, the town doesn't have much going for it. Lou loves her job waitressing at a cafe, until the owner informs her he's shutting it down. Without skills or much of an education, Lou has trouble finding a job. Fortunately, a disabled man living nearby needs a caretaker.<br /><br />When Lou meets the quadriplegic thirty-five year old Will Traynor, she cringes from his harsh criticism and disdainful attitude. He's a proper arse, and she'd love to quit but her family desperately needs her income. Will was a wealthy venture capitalist who sustained a horrific accident that severed his spinal cord. He pines for the adventurous, elegant life he once led. To boot, he's in chronic physical pain.<br /><br />Turns out Lou has a tragic past of her own, and if two souls ever needed each other, these two do. But they get off to such a rocky start that it doesn't seem possible for love to bloom in this dark place. Another barrier is Lou's long-time boyfriend Patrick, who had \\"the kind of face that became instantly invisible in crowds\\". Patrick is a compulsive exerciser, training for triathlons and neglecting Lou for the most part.<br /><br />Other than the compelling characterization, I loved the realism of this story. It's gut-wrenching but never sappy or predictable. And the humor is a welcome relief from the intense sadness. For example, Will bonding with Lou's father by laughing over all of her faults brought a smile to my face. (Her father likes to refer to her as \\"lardarse\\".)<br /><br />One of my favorite scenes is when Will takes Lou toher first classical music concert:<br /><br />\\"The conductor stepped up, tapped twice on the rostrum, and great hush descended. I felt the stillness, the auditorium alive, expectant. Then he brought down his baton and suddenly everything was pure sound. I felt the music like a physical thing; it didn't just sit in my ears, it flowed through me, around me, made my senses vibrate. It made my skin prickle and my palms dampen. Will hadn't described any of it like this. I had thought I might be bored. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever heard.\\"<br /><br />When Lou discovers a Traynor family secret, she creates an \\"anti bucket\\" list that's full of love and hope. Will she succeed in her mission?<br /><br />Lou narrates from her point-of-view but a few chapters enter the heads of other characters, which I think adds to the story.<br /><br />I still haven't worked out the title in relation to the story. Does anyone have insight?<br /><br />Me Before You and Hopeless have been my favorite reads of 2013. If you like emotional reads, get this book now!

B005HEPIDS|4.0|Voyager, the third spin-off of the highly successful original Star Trek series from the late 1960’s, holds its own with the previous spin-offs, Next Generation and Deep Space Nine.  Due to its plotline, being lost in the Delta quadrant, it was able to venture into material the other series couldn’t.  While they still used a lost Klingon or Ferengi, not to mention “Q”, they moved on to new cultures, creatures, and scientific advances.<br /><br />That said, I found the writing to be superb insofar as plotlines, and character development.  One sore point was Capt. Janeway.  There’s no way in all of creation a ship’s captain makes so many bad decisions and comes out without a scratch.  The command decisions she made during the last year of the series were at best head scratching.  While I find the writing to be inventive and resourceful insofar as the new ideas presented, the ultra liberal bent of character Janeway, clearly shows why a liberal government or in this case a ship’s captain, is destructive to society as a whole.  I say this not to reflect on the actress Kate Mulgrew, she only played the part written for her.  Then again, it is a syfi/fantasy show so anything goes.<br /><br />The acting becomes automatic, as in any TV show where the actor plays the part for any length of time.  There were standout parts, as in Robert Picardo as the holographic doctor, who was also a standout actor in the Stargate spin-off SG1.  I can’t say enough good things about his acting.  Thanks to the writers for giving him a lot of air time.  Roxanne Dawson was superb as B'Elanna Torres, and Jeri Ryan (Seven of Nine) how did she keep such a stiff attitude for so many shows.  I think she was one of everyone’s favorites.<br /><br />All in all a series worth watching, certainly as good as Next Generation, but maybe a bit shy of matching Deep Space Nine, but an excellent choice once you except the ultra liberal slant of the Janeway character.  You do grow to accept her as the captain; only one you wouldn’t want to serve under.  In real life she would have killed her entire crew the first year.  She did manage to get them lost in the Delta quadrant.s the captain; only one you wouldn’t want to serve under.  In real life she would have killed her entire crew the first year.  She did manage to get them lost in the Delta quadrant.
B0050CQY1W|3.0|This CD is not the best CD from Beyoncé. If you want the best get her first solo album Dangerously In Love. This is my second CD from Beyoncé & all I can say is that it's simply an Ok album, I can't say that it's good. The songs that are a winner to me are:<br />Love on Top- just can't get enough of this song every time I hear it I just can't sit down I have to get up & sing along & pretend I'm the best singer in the world.<br />Party- Love this song too death, This song is a lot similar to Love on Top because they both have that 80's feel to them. These two songs come off classy & mature to me & I'm glad that these were the singles for Beyoncé because if they wasn't I probably wouldn't have gotten the CD. But unfortunately not all of the songs on this CD are just like these two songs because if they were I probably would've been about to say this is a GOOD CD instead of an OK CD.<br />Best Thing I Never Had- This song reminds me of her song Irreplaceable mainly because they both have the same theme- that the guy is not all that & there is someone better out there.<br />I Miss You- I love this song because just like Party & Love on Top it has that 80s feel as well. Not only do I love the song, but I love the lyrics.<br />End of Time- This song sounds so magical. I could definitely imagine it being played at a circus which is weird I know, but when I listen to it elephants & lions come to my mind. Plus it just makes me want to get up & dance. This is another song that you cannot just sit down on.<br />Overall this CD was not her best CD my friends disagree w/ me when I say Dangerously in Love was her best album, but compared to this album it was to me. Anyway I never bought her other albums, but those two mainly because I'm not that big of a fan of Beyoncé. But if you like upbeat song you will definitely enjoy this album because there are not too many slows songs on here. I just thought that she was trying to hard with her vocal seem like she did more yelling than screaming on some of the songs like 1+1.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I really loved this book. I stayed up to 2 in the a.m.to read it to the end. A real old fashioned love story. I don't do that ordinarily.
B005DWA5KK|3.0|I enjoyed it. The silent film has not died! Costumes, sets, lighting, all well done. The story was somewhat too simplistic for my taste, though others may find it thoroughly enjoyable.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|This was the Worst book to movie Adaptation that I have ever seen.  Missing characters, major plot lines deleted from the story.  It was as if they knew when they started making this movie that they would not be making the entire series into movies.  They just plain left out things and characters that are essential to the continuation of the story.  Very disappointing!  I gave it 3 stars because I watched it with someone who had not read the book and she enjoyed it thoroughly.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This was a g reat film for the entire family!  Grandpa, Grandma, Dad, Mom and grandchildren enjoyed the drama and cinematography!
B001AITGWE|4.0|In this film it is not just the Michael Douglas character, D-Fense, who is facing a life that is less than what each expected or were seemingly promised by society.  The detective chose a lifetime of security employment by working for government, only to have his family taken from him. D-Fens perceives that working in the less secure private sector has trapped him in unemployment and cost him his family.  His antagonists are angry predators; portrayed ironically as victims of being trapped in bad neighborhoods and thus creations of a society that built super highways that once allowed motorists to speed by and around the \\"Have-nots\\", but now have bumper to bumper traffic jams that keep people trapped in their cars as their lives pass them by.  D-Fens is afraid of slipping even further into the unwashed of society and decides to fight back against those who are trying to drag him down further into a civilization that is not working despite the great promise and prosperity that California knew and serves as a warning to the rest of the country. It has turned out to be true.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game. Just finished and can't wait for the next one. My daughter is playing on her kindle and is right behind me.
B00CATSONE|4.0|We all have a little Tesla inside us. We just need to be brave enough to let it out. When you have a better idea or way of doing things, we are often afraid of ridicule and failure and do not act on our ideas.  The world needs more Teslas.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Large buttons, easily readable fonts and uncluttered screen keeps it very simple. Very easy to use and kids can use it independently.
6305433909|5.0|I already owned &#34;Sister Act&#34; and wanted to own &#34;Sister Act 2&#34; to complete my collection. I have seen this movie in VHS version ans found it a wonderful movie. now I have both &#34;Sister Act&#34; and Sister Act 2&#34; in DVD and I am not sorry I purchased &#34;Sister Act 2&#34; Through Amazon. After watching this movie for a third tome I still find myself enchanted by the actress Whoopi Goldberg as she plaid the leading actress.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kids just love this game. Very fast paced game and need instant reflexes. The graphics are fantastic and the over experience is too good.
B0091REZMW|1.0|Why?????? You have the real estate...why can't you even allow a zoom for hidden  objectivity names? Think about your targeted audience! We are not 14 yr. Old boys! Can't say if game's good or bad cuz squinting gave me a headache!
B00CHILW64|5.0|I really like this movie, the action, the actors ect. Makes you feel appreciative of your own family! I think everyone should watch it !
B0043WDK2G|5.0|I believe that Castle is one of the most well written shows that we have seen for a long time. The writers know how to keep the suspense, and have us climbing for more . Season 3 is full of action, drama, and a bit of romance. I would recommend this to anybody. Even if you don't think you're a mystery fan, I can say you will probably still love castle. : )
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|The movie is a new play on an old theme . . . Reincarnation.  This time juxtaposed against mankinds natural depravity and the inevitable movement to tame that depravity and move humanity forward.  While making an entertaining movie, it's not a concept that carries any weight of possibility in it's hull.  It probably appeals to the dreamer in Tom Hanks and most of us, including me, but that appeal is to our species' narcissism.  In other words, we think it's all about us, and that we are so important that there is no way we can cease to exist for eternity.  Hence the reincarnation conception.  We embrace ideas that favor us most.<br /><br />If you have a scientific mind and truly care about the search for truth and reality, an entertaining movie is all this can be.  There is something to this universe that we still do not know.  It's likely that it teems with life and it's very purpose is the development of life.  But not just human life.  Whatever the \\"end\\" is, it includes all life and not just us.<br /><br />So the movie IS entertaining . . . And it makes you think.  That can't be a bad thing.
B000GGSM94|4.0|Another CD I bought him. I believe it was the first I purchased for him. The Cure is his favourite, this was as good a purchase as any!
B001GMQALY|1.0|This movie seems to be all about the sex... The acting is pretty bad, too.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|\\"EAt MY S***!\\" by far a great line from this movie. Bought this for my mom for mother's day 2013. She loves it.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|This movie gets funnier and funnier every time that I see it.  The animation is amazing and as I have already mentioned it is a hilarious movie.
B0068LYEHA|2.0|Moran is far too good a writer -and far too funny - to have taken one subject and driven it into the ground.  We have<br />all been through the painful adolescent years, but in retrospect, there was some humor there, as well.  Growing up<br />can be hard to do, but unless you are naturally deviant, there is more subject matter for contemplation than body<br />parts.
B00AAQRNQ8|1.0|I can not rate it because I can not use it. Package arrived on time in good condition but the installation instructions tell me to install the software? I did not receive any software.
B008A1B5Z0|5.0|I have tried many utilities, I can't understand why we have to do that to get our systems to run smoothly or maybe I do, $$$. Well I like the way this one lets you know when it has cleared up space on the fly when you get low, a small popup for a few seconds. You configure what you want. You can also do a bulk clear.

B002WV5A9G|5.0|Emotion is the main theme for this movie and it's sequel! I loved them both for the actors' portrayal of these classic characters and the modern new look at the strange new life & civilizations we once knew in our younger days. I'm more of a Next Generation fan, but this...THIS is a good way to start to know the Star Trek franchise, and why you should check out the first series.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I must say that this was a poor ending to the series. I didn't think that this book followed the expectation the series had. I would not recommend this book.
B006RXQ27O|5.0|The fact that this movie brought together EVERY cartoon legend (Disney, Warner, MCM & so on) is reason enough to watch it. That and Christopher Loyd's portrayal as Judge Doom, a villain who's actions, musical score, and true identity brings more chills through the body than today's cartoon villains. I could do without the talking car though.
B005LAII80|5.0|this should have been in theaters longer. highly recommend it. this blows the old judge dredd with stalone out of the water
147674355X|4.0|3.5 stars<br /><br />Hopeless was nothing like what I had expected. It was intense, dark, emotional, and heart-breaking, but also very beautiful and inspirational. I was struggling between loving it and hating it - you can just say I'm somewhere in between, leaning a tad bit more towards loving it (hence, the 3.5 stars).<br /><br />I liked Sky a lot. I loved how she was struggling with feelings. Even though she makes out with guys, she has never experienced the fluttering-butterflies-in-her-tummy feeling before. It was like she was blocking out any physical and/or emotional connection from the guys she made out with. I also loved how she knew so little about technology and lived her life in her books.<br /><br />\\"My lack of access to the real world has been replaced completely by books, and it can't be healthy to live in a land of happily ever afters.\\"<br /><br />\\"One of the things I love about books is being able to define & condense certain portions of a character's life into chapters. It's intriguing, because you can't do this with real life. You can't just end a chapter, then skip the things you don't want to live through, only to open it up to a chapter that better suits your mood. Life can't be divided into chapters...only minutes. The events of your life are all crammed together one minute right after the other without any time lapses or blank pages or chapter breaks because no matter what happens life just keeps going and moving forward and words keep flowing & truths keep spewing whether you like it or not and life never lets you pause and just catch your breath.\\"<br />\\"I need one of those chapter breaks. I just want to catch my breath, but I have no idea how.\\"<br /><br />I also loved Sky and Holder's unspoken non-committed exclusive confusing non-relationship. I loved how they both knew they had undeniably strong feeling for each other right off the bat but didn't say the three big words to each other until closer towards the end.<br /><br />\\"Breckin, this is Holder. Holder is not my boyfriend, but if I catch him trying to break the record for best first kiss with another girl, then he'll soon be my not breathing non-boyfriend.\\"<br /><br />I didn't hate him, but I didn't connect with his character that much. I can't really describe in words the exact reason why I didn't like him as much - he was just too wordy, too sweet, too expressive.<br /><br />\\"Sky, if you're wondering if I have commitment issues, the answer is no. Someday in the far, far, far away future...like post-college future...when I propose to you...which I will be doing one day because you aren't getting rid of me...I won't be marrying you with the hope that our marriage will work out. When you become mine, it'll be a forever thing. I've told you before that the only thing that matters to me with you are the forevers, and I mean that.\\"<br /><br />\\"All marriages have a time limit if you enter them for the wrong reasons. Marriage doesn't get easier...it only gets harder. If you marry someone hoping it will improve things, you might as well set your timer the second you say, `I do.\\"<br /><br />I have to admit though, he had his sweep-me-off-my-feet moments.<br /><br />\\"The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if you've never felt anything when someone's kissed you, then no one's ever really kissed you. Not the way I plan on kissing you.\\"<br /><br />You fell asleep right when she was about to find out her mother's secret. How dare you. I'll be back tomorrow night so you can finish reading it to me. And by the way, you have really bad breath and you snore way too loud.<br /><br />I also liked both Six and Breckin. I just love their personalities and their role in the book. They're both hilarious and they balanced the seriousness of the story with their humor.<br /><br />Holder gives him a half smile, but he's staring at the coffee cup on Breckin's desk. \\"I thought Mormons weren't allowed to have caffeine.\\"<br />Breckin shrugs. \\"I decided to break that rule the morning I woke up gay.\\"<br /><br />During the first few chapters, I saw all the signs and the clues telling you that it will be a very predictable, corny, silly, funny story leading to a happily ever after. I was ready to give up on the book and give it a 1.5-star rating because aside from the immature conversations and interactions between the characters and the fact that Holder was slowly starting to piss me off, I thought I had it all figured out - only to know in the end that I wasn't even close. It was very unpredictable - dark, heart-breaking, and a tad bit sick if you ask me. The big twist in the end was what made me give it a higher rating that what I was going to give it originally.<br /><br />I recommend this to mature adults who are looking to read a heavy drama - and a bit dark and sickening - contemporary romance. It is somewhat inspiring and uplifting in the end.<br /><br />For more reviews like this, please visit booksandbindings.comecided to break that rule the morning I woke up gay.\\"<br /><br />During the first few chapters, I saw all the signs and the clues telling you that it will be a very predictable, corny, silly, funny story leading to a happily ever after.

B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Definitely among my \\"desert island\\" picks. Wow! I mean, this woman is utterly amazing: talented up the wazoo, mutli-faceted/genre-crossover-skilled and original as can be. This album runs the gamut from whimsical-magical-etheric... to edgy-energized-punk(ish)... with lots of kick-ass funk, melodious beauty, rich orchestration, and inspiring ideas sandwiched in between. I'd like to give it 10 stars, but alas, I'm limited to 5 here. The ArchAndroid is nothing short of a masterpiece!

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have been using this app for a while.  It is simple to use and does a great job on what it is designed for....some apps try to put more bells and whistles in their products and end up making them too complicated for the majority of their customers.  This is a great app.

B00CWVFZ8W|2.0|Wife wanted to see it. Unlike the trailer, this movie was lacking action. Teen romance, not witches battling for the soul of a witch. Lame.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|The movie doesn't do the book any justice. I'm surprised it bears the same title. As I was watching it seems 95% of the plot didn't happen in the book.  The movie plot wasn't all that great either.  Don't bother with this one.  It's definitely over-hyped in my opinion.

B001FB4VXU|5.0|I've bought several tv shows from this seller, and everything has been great. I would recommend them to anyone, and will buy again.
B00CFQN12Q|3.0|It was not too bad. The first Die Hard movie came out in 1988. That was a major action movie for that time. It was at the end of the Cold War. This time McClain is in Russia. The action is pretty decent, it is obviously not a movie you would take your girlfriend to - it's an action movie. Perhaps far more could have been done to give us a little more detail about the mystical Cold War and the characters and the plot, but it is pretty standard action.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|This movie gets high school students to think about where their food comes from.  The students have quite a few questions while watching this one.

B0067EKYS6|3.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />Where to start, where to start. There are many words I can use to describe The Great Gatsby and none of them are positive. It took less than four minutes for this film to turn me off and inform me, \\"Yup, everything you feared is true. You wanna walk out now and save yourself the time?\\" To be completely honest I should have because The Great Gatsby felt like two and a half hours of torture. They took everything this film could, and should, have been and tossed it out the window. Instead of attempting to make a film that would go down in history as a classic, they went the easy route and set their sights on the teenage audience. Not only is this film disrespectful to F. Scott Fitzgerald, but it does a great disservice to the source material.<br /><br />I should note that I was never particularly fond of The Great Gatsby to begin with. I thought the story itself was enjoyable enough, but Fitzgerald's writing style was very... odd. Plus, I always felt that the novel just wasn't good from a literary standpoint. However, I thought that, if done right, it would make for a great piece of film. Which was why I was so excited when this movie was first announced. My excitement was only enhanced when I found out that you had DiCaprio playing Gatsby and Maguire playing Nick, what could go wrong? Apparently a lot could go wrong because somewhere along the line someone suggested \\"let's modernize it\\" and the end result was disastrous.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the story you have man named Nick Carraway, the narrator, who lives next door to a very wealthy man by the name of Jay Gatsby. Now Gatsby is sort of an enigma. No one really knows who he is or where he came from so, of course, people start making up rumors about him. Gatsby frequently throws huge, extravagant parties at his mansion. No one ever receives an invitation and only a handful of people actually know what he looks like. We later learn that all ofthis is done in the hopes that Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan), a woman from his past and Nick's cousin, would show up one day. The problem is that Daisy is a married woman now, but it's obvious that there's still that connection between the two of them. He loves her and she loves him, but she also loves her husband, Tom (Joel Edgerton). In the end what you're given is a story filled with secrets, death, and the consequences of one man's love for a woman.<br /><br />The one and only thing this movie does well is the fact that they basically took the book page by page and transferred it into a film. Majority of the time film adaptions leave stuff out or they change big events, but they did a very good job at sticking to the source material. I only noticed a few minor differences with the first being that the story is told by Nick to a therapist. I don't remember that being part of the novel, but I think this was done just to give the story some sort of context. Then they had Gatsby overuse the phrase \\"Old sport\\". It was a common phrase of his, but he didn't say it in almost every single sentence. It got a little annoying after a while. Oh, and it seemed as if they downplayed Jordan Baker's (Elizabeth Debicki) role. She just didn't feel as important as she did in the book. Keep in mind that none of these were major gripes, just observations. As we were leaving the theater I overheard a woman say \\"They were really accurate with the story.\\" Which is absolutely true. It's almost insane how accurate they were with everything, but accuracy doesn't mean a damn thing if everything else in the movie is done wrong and, unfortunately, everything else is very wrong.<br /><br />As odd as it sounds the person I blame the most is Jay-Z. From the moment it was announced that he was chosen to \\"compose\\" the film's soundtrack I knew it was doomed. Having Jay-Z in charge of a movie's soundtrack just screams \\"modernization\\" and I was right. My biggest issue with The Great Gatsby is themusic that fills the scenes. Answer me this: why in the hell would you have a bunch of modern music in a movie set in the 1920's? It's almost hilarious how big this man's ego is. Not only did he screw up the soundtrack by not including music from that time period, but he put four of his own songs in the film. Not one, not two, four. Why? WHY?!? From a music standpoint the Hip Hop we know today (rhyming over beats) didn't get created until the 70's. So why would you do that? What purpose did it serve other than to boost your own ego? Oh, and trust me, it's not just music that's played over the scenes for the viewers to hear. The music is actually in the scenes. During one of Gatsby's parties when Nick and Jordan are in the library and they meet the man who looks like an owl, you can hear the bass thumping from outside the room like they're at a high school party. I wanted to scream and chuck my drink at the screen. All this film needed was someone to compose a powerful score. That's it. It didn't need all that flair and it definitely didn't need music from artists that weren't even thought of yet.<br /><br />Unfortunately Jay-Z isn't the only thing wrong with this film. Almost everything that had to do with the technical side of film making is beyond terrible. During the parts where Nick was narrating what's going on you see words flying across the screen because he's typing this story on a type writer. Not only is this effect overdone in the film industry, it takes the viewer out of the experience because it's overdone in the film itself. There's a section towards the end of the movie where the screen is literally filled with letters and words. It reached a point where it stopped serving an artistic purpose and they were doing it just to do it. Then the amount of green screen they used was almost hilarious. Almost every single piece of scenery is fake. What's worse is that the scenes that use the green screen aren't even believable because they don't look real. Justlike the letters flying across the screen, the green screen is overdone as well. The only thing the green screen accomplished was making it difficult for the viewer to appreciate the physical sets that were used because by that point it's hard to care. Once again all this does is take the viewer out of the experience.<br /><br />The film excels when it acts as a film and nothing more. When there's actors doing a scene, reciting the script, and making the novel come alive. A great example would be when Gatsby first brings Daisy to his house. When he's showing her around and DeCaprio, Maguire, and Mulligan are just acting. It's a wonderful thing to watch because it's what it needs to be. It's simple and it's engaging. There's a fine line between making the scenes grand and explosive and making them over the top and annoying. I truly believe that Baz Luhrmann doesn't comprehend the difference. There's just so much wrong with this film's execution that it almost hurt me to watch it.<br /><br />It may have been a bit of an exaggeration when I said the only thing good about the film was the fact that they stuck to the source material. That isn't entirely true. The cast in here was, surprisingly, great. I never pictured DiCaprio as Gatsby or Debicki as Jordan, but it would be wrong to deny that they both gave great performances. DiCaprio is DiCaprio so you can't really go wrong with him and Maguire gave a solid performance as Nick. Nothing spectacular, but he served his purpose. Out of everyone involved I think Carey Mulligan and Joel Edgerton were the best choices for their respective roles. They're how I envisioned the characters while reading the novel and they both delivered fantastic performances.<br /><br />Overall Score: 5/10 - It's almost depressing how much of a disappointment this was. The film's final 30 minutes are what I expected the entire movie to feel like; powerful and moving, but that's not what I was given. Any enjoyment that can been found in The GreatGatsby is buried beneath the god awful music and the overdone special effects. Baz Luhrmann was perhaps too ambitious in what he set out to do here and the film is ultimately ruined because of it. There's no doubt in my mind that there's going to be a young audience who finds this fascinating, but for those with a more developed mind this is nothing more than a movie that will soon be forgotten. A faint memory of what could have been. I can't say I will ever watch this again so see this at your own risk.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I loved this book. A great perspective on what our warriors go through in war regardless of service branch. I really liked the added insight given by his wife. A true American hero.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|If you're interested in the world of power-exchange and BDSM, or just want a short trashy beach-read, this is your book. REMEMBER IT'S FICTION.  This book is rife with nods to propagating rape culture, where if you get hurt, it's probably because you asked for it, and if someone is abusive, well they probably had some trauma to work through at your expense. And it's apparently OK to think that you are in love with someone who terrifies you to the point of lack of appetite.  There are just soooo many things wrong with this book, but hey, I like a little cheap smut now and then too.

B000FC1HBY|2.0|This story spans a number of books and I believe that is a problem. I am no literary scholar, but the characters lack any type of arch for the most part and it just seems like the author is throwing scenarios at these characters and they react with little thought(minus the Lannisters) and just move on.
B005544TRQ|5.0|It was very much to my liking.  I can't stop watching it !!  Loved characters and every episode brought a new adventure in the law. I found it very amusing and was very disappointed that season two was not part of the Prime package.

B00A0ABQLM|4.0|So far it works great. Once the drivers were installed it started working immediately. Getting drivers loaded was plagued with a very minor issue. The only CD device I have on the machine I wanted to use it has a slot fed CD reading device, and mini discs are not supported. I just created a CD image from the mini on another machine with a CD drive with a tray and burned that to a regular sized CD from that image. I did not bother looking online, since if I ever needed this again in a pinch I would likely not be online.

B00A77II0U|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever downloaded.  If you like thinking games this the one.  So go for it.
B00BP4X3W2|4.0|The book is a tale about a real person that does what he can too slow and interfere with the Nazi slave labor and death machine in Poland. He is a flawed person who does so at great risk to himself and his wealth. Spielberg does a great job with images and photography but his telling of the story leaves much to be desired.
B004RZGUBM|3.0|I am enjoying reading the complete works of Charles Dickens in chronological order. I am also reading them in instalments just as did the people in his day. It takes a while to get into the circumlocutious style of writing fashionable of the era; but once digested, I really enjoy Dicken's sense of humour and his keen observations of human foibles and behaviour. I did not rate this collection higher than 3 stars because the promise of illustrations is what drew me to this publication. However, the illustrations cannot be enlarged and on my KIndle are quite tiny, so that is a bit disappointing.<br />I recommend reading  and digesting Dicken's works slowly and comfortably, as one might chat to an old friend over a warm, satisfying meal.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Its a beautifully shot movie about a kid learning to surf the monster waves called &#34;mavericks,&#34; but it is about so much more than that. Its about learning goals, discipline, hard work, respect, facing his fears, and learning to become a man in the best sense of the word. The respect and role models depicted make a good choice for everyone, especially for teenagers.
0307476464|3.0|(Note : I read the book in Japanese.  This means I read the Book 1 and Book 2 together.  Then I had to wait for a year for the book 3)<br /><br />I loved reading and re-reading some scenes: Tengo's first meeting with Fukaeri at restaurant, his comical third meeting with her, Aomame facing the Leader... the list goes on.  Some of those scenes are very funny/humorous.  Others are moving containing some beautiful proses.<br /><br />Yet, overall, the book was not as satisfactory as Kafka on the Shore or The End of the World and Hard-Boiled Wonderland.  This is mainly because the way the Books 1&2 ended; the Tengo's editor disappers, Tengo discovers a cocoon; you have no idea what happened to Fukaeri.  There were just too many undeveloped story lines. On the other hand, Aomame standing in the traffic jam holding a gun.  That definitely looked like the end of the story. Put together, the impression was like watching an interesting, but spooky play in which characters disappear from the stage one by one without explanations.  It was a bizarre ending.<br /><br />Then Book 3 came out one year later.  Again there were some interesting scenes.  I liked parts about Tamaru and Ushikawa. Fukaeri seemed to become less and less human, and more and more of somebody supernatural from \\"the other side.\\"  But at the end, again, the book had too many loose ends.  What would happen to Aomame and the cult?  The baby?  What are the Little People doing with Ushikawa?  Again, so many undeveloped story lines. (And I thought that Aomame surviving the last scene of the Book 2 was somewhat unconvincing. )<br /><br />All in all, great parts, but an unsatisfactory structure.
B005LAIGRS|3.0|This is a typical Denzel drama movie. It is good, and I like Denzel, but it was predictable.  Buy it if the price is right.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|The movie was well acted; Jennifer Lawrence is great, but the plot was depressing and the directing was all over the place. Key points were made too subtle and I just cant figure out why so many people liked it.
B008WCP2PG|2.0|I didn't enjoy this movie. It was dark, and a little depressing. I was hoping for a feel good, cheap thrill of a movie. Also, not enough Mathew in this movie. I wish I hadn't purchased it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The story was very relatable and realistic, especially if you are raising or raised teenagers.  Unfortunately it shows the darker side of how we think we find justice, and the destruction it makes of defendants and their families.  There was an interesting piece of the story surrounding a mental evaluation and the supposed report.  Did not see the ending coming at all, it was a surprise.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|Not really. This did not work at all!  Uploaded and tried to let me son play and it just constantly said we needed to pay for the upgrade in order to use certain parts of this app. Waste of time. TOTALLY SUCKED!
B008R5OKI8|5.0|Naive have released five discs of violin concertos. The other four suffer a bit from mostly unknown concertos presented for the fans. This one opens with RV 177, which has had other recordings. RV242 is from the same set that had the Four Seasons and has been well recorded. The disc is well balanced and organized, a joy to listen to.<br /><br />It is also a part of a 6 disc economical box now.<br /><br />Naxos has four discs of Vivaldi concertos associated with Pisendel. There is no overlap with these, as all those are in the Dresden library.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I read the whole series.  It grabs your attention from the start and<br />doesn't let go!!  Really liked the book!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Mystery manor is a fun game to play.<br />It draws you in and holds your attention.<br />Be aware that it may never let you go once you start playing.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|slow, boring. hated it. couldn't hold the attention of my entire family. typical crap the snooty critics love. boo!! boo!!!!!
B0027MJU00|4.0|No spoilers here. I loved \\"Gone Girl\\" (Hitchcock, anyone?), and I also read \\"Sharp Objects,\\" which I didn't like very much (too over-the-top Gothic for me). I decided to give \\"Dark Places\\" a try, since I appreciate Flynn's ability to turn a phrase and capture a moment or a person's look/manner in just a few words-- really fun, as a reader.<br /><br />My favorite element of this novel is the structure. Not only did it make the book more interesting to read, it also heightened the suspense.<br /><br />Again, no spoilers, but it was rather easy for me to guess -- at least in part -- how the story would end. Unfortunately, the resolution was so unrealistic that it nearly ruined the book for me.<br /><br />But because I enjoyed reading the book up until that point, I still give it 4 stars. I won't hold a weak ending against Flynn, who gave me a couple of hours of good entertainment.<br /><br />No, her characters are not exactly endearing, for the most part. Yes, she writes about situations that can be grotesque. But we spend so much of our lives hiding our darkest thoughts, it's refreshing to see them expressed from time to time. And in Flynn's case, expressed eloquently.
B000IZA9NU|5.0|Great acting, Capt. Picard was awesome as usual along with all the other actors. A good title for the film as well. I wish they would have done a little more with Data with more special effects though when he walked under the water, etc. The admiral being out in deep space by himself without his own ship and crew working out this deal with the head alien was a little unrealistic. But like all of the Star Trek movies and the tv series you watch them because the actors work good together, you've grown to appreciate them, and they all make the films worth watching regardless.
B00BTJMS1A|3.0|Good game, but not as hard as I thought. Took only a few days to beat it. Could use some more features - gets a bit repetitive after a while.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Would have given a better review if 1:It didn't load like a turtle. 2:If it wouldn't freeze periodically. 3:If it wouldn't say,&quot;vTube has stopped working.&quot; AND 4: And if the keyboard just wouldn't randomly disappear at some times, I would've given this application a much better review.
B009NY43NY|3.0|this is easily the worst book of the series. it just does not level up to the firsts books, the series just is getting worse and worse,
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Don't judge this DVD by the first 10 minutes of the performance...The first two songs the band performs are a little &#34;iffy&#34;, not so much poorly performed, just kinda like they are searching for their musical legs.  By the third song Roberts got the dust off the vocal chords and Jimmy has loosened up the fingers and it is -game- on-.  If you are an older Zep fan you are going to LOVE this album.DVD....if you are a youngster listening to The Zep for the first time, well hang on, you're about to learn what rock and roll is REALLY all about.
B00003CXDG|5.0|I like all the MI series, but this one is one of my favorites.  The leading lady is so sensual/sexual/cute and the action is awesome as it is in all the MI series.  LOVE IT, RECOMMEND IT!!
B009EDZGY4|5.0|I bought this for my son for his 11th birthday and he was so excited and happy. We both are happy happy happy.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|LOVE this movie!!  It is touching, funny, interesting and I was able to relate to it totally as I near retirement.  TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT!!
B000Q9IR0A|5.0|As noted in the book we are almost inundated with books about strategy development, innovation, people development etc.  Doubtlessly these are all very important, and many leaders are well-versed in these.  So why do we still see so many failures?  It's all about actually executing strategies, in breaking them down into manageable components that can be acted upon and regularly monitored. It's also about having the right people in the right places to &#34;make it happen&#34; with their teams.  Overall an excellent book that painfully brought out many problems in our management activities and styles.  To be reread regularly.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I like this game because it is fast paced and it makes you have to think quickly.It is a lot of fun.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I read this book a few years ago, and have continued to read more of the series as they come out. Jeff Kinney has found the perfect way to connect with middle grade readers and almost anyone else. The book (which according to Kinney, was originally written as a humorous book for adults) is an instant classic and has found it's way into millions of people's bookshelves worldwide because it connects with almost everyone's experiences in middle school, and will have you laughing throughout. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a funny read and would recommend [[ASIN:B00CGMGMHK Diary of a Middle School Nobody]] and any of the Big Nate books for anyone who enjoyed the Wimpy Kid books and is looking for something else to read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game!!! I have so much fun playing this game! It's almost like I have a real live pet horse. You can feed, pet, and train in competitions.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|It was Arnold at his best, (for his age :) ) had a lot of funny dialog and a lot more violence. And an AWESOME car!! We would recommend for car and Arnold lover's but keep children out.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|One of the best in the Pendergast/Helen series.  Take your time with it, this is something to be savored.  This should be read in order.
0385347774|5.0|The book was in great condition. I already read the book and am ready for the others Flynn has written.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book and can not wait to read the second book. If you have not read this book yet.... start right now
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book even more than the others!!! I just hate that it's the end! :( It really is a good book choice.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|What can I say...............one of the best albums ever produced and still selling well to this day!  There is no comparison.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is a lot of fun for my 4 year old &amp; my 12 year old!!! They love it! :)
B003DZX3SA|5.0|We watch this movie together as a family (over and over) and never get sick of it. So well made and the story is great!!!
B005OYKIJ0|4.0|Like all Fast and Furious movies, Fast Five involved lots of stealing fast cars, driving fast cars, shooting, fighting, explosions, etc. If you like cars and over-the-top action movies then you'll probably like this movie. There is a lot of violence but it's not the gory violence you see in a movie like Rambo - just lots of shooting and explosions. Also, there is some profanity but very little sexual content.<br /><br />The acting is average, and some of Vin Diesels are a little cheesy, but overall it's pretty good. We like both Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson, so putting them together in the same movie is a win. The fight scene is great, and I lost track of the number of walls they punched through.<br /><br />I would recommend seeing this movie at least once, but probably won't own it. I liked Vin Diesel a lot better in The Pacifier (yeah I know I'll get flamed for that comment), and I liked Dwayne Johnson better in The RunDown.
B009GEYX5E|2.0|I bought this for my daughter and the pictures either turned out too bright or too dark. Also the pack she recieved only came with 8, not 10 films.
B0086213XW|4.0|An interesting waltz into one finding themselves in twice in love: with ones first &#34;childhood&#34; like marriage partner and a more connective second new found person.  As often is true in life, there are no universally happy solutions nor endings here.  If you can take a bit of reality, well worth an empathetic look.
B004I1AGTM|4.0|My kids and I love martial arts movies. This is one of the movies that we enjoy watching over and over again. Highly recommended.
0399224459|5.0|Our grown daughter is a zoo keeper and has been a night keeper, her daughter especailly loves the story since she has grown up with a huge love of animals.  I think any child would love this charming story!
B007EE4XKI|5.0|I'm definitely going to continue the series, as well as go back and read some of the books alluded to to in this one like immortal coil.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|we have loaned our set to our grown kids and friends so often that we are starting to give the sets as gifts!  It's so much fun and so well done, would love to see more of this type of programing!  We watch it more than once because we enjoy it so much.
B005SAYRA6|4.0|It's a nice movie with good action! Not many cool cars but the story is better than previous parts. Loved the suspense!!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|One of the best books of the year? I don't know. Is it a fantastic and addicting story? Yes. No doubt there. I was re-reading certain passages during my first read because they were so mesmerizing. As soon as I finished the the book, I started re-reading it from the beginning.<br /><br />This book is heavy on references to 1980's pop culture. It is a techno-thriller. It is a story about nerds. However, at the same time, it is a story about our society. It is a story about our imminent future. It is a story about what can happen when the development of species of animal gets interwoven with sophisticated technology.<br /><br />I hope there is a prequel, sequel or spin-off from this book. If there is, I will be reading it and so will anyone else who reads Ready Player One.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Have fun ,but it is addictive passes time and relaxing  worth it to me to be able to relax my mind. Work is stressful  but this is no streets and fun too
B000002LCK|5.0|I missed this 2 CD set couldn`t find it at the local record shop they said about $80.  if they could find one around !  I kept looking and one day it popped up on Pandora ... ordered it on the spot!  I will look again for hard to find music at &#34; Forever Young Records&#34;  Great packing too, in a box not a padded envolope !!
B005H9B44A|5.0|Fullpower, busting action scenes and interesting story, gotta love the acting with Chris Hemsworth and Natalie. Seems like the whole thing's only 20 min, it's so packed.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|I am a big fan of the Eagles, and this told DVD told their story, along with many facts that were previously unknown by myself and probably many fans. The video and audio quality was excellent. This is a real keeper!!
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|I can't even get this game to show up on my kindle. It was a complete waste since I can't play it
B008220BLG|5.0|What makes this such a likable movie, is the fact it's not your typical generic zombie flick. It puts a new twist on (R)omeo & Juliet, while offering both perceptive's of both human & zombie. It's refreshing, different, has a little bit of everything & not to mention a likable cast!
B00C5XBAOA|3.0|We received this particular family set, the carriage, tea set, and bedroom set today.  My girls have been playing with them for only a half hour, and already I've put heads back on the dolls a dozen times.  And they are not playing rough with them at all.  They are frustrated that King James can't sit down or stand.  They are very true to character in terms of design, although the character set we have from the Disney Store is much better quality.  They certainly haven't stopped playing with them, and we will keep them.  But there is a lot of room for improvement here.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It's a really good game but has its cons too at higher levels it's really confusing on which path to go and a bit boring at times but for a daily user it can be really interesting...!!!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The most Awesome game I played I loved it, it's a lot like temple run but way better, I just love it.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I've played all the scribblenauts games. Normal,super,unlimited. But this 99&cent; game is great! I agree with all of the five star reviews.i beat all of the levels of it.on lev. 2-1 I created a tsunami. Too bad a big dog can't ride a small cat. And type in death. There's a surprise. Anyway I recommend to anyone who can spell.
B001VPJYZK|5.0|I love and have all of the Desperate Housewives DVDs.  It was one of the best series ever on TV and it is fun to go back and watch the DVDs.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Normally don't like Sci-Fi - but I Love me some Walking Dead!! Caution: This show can be habit forming! Enjoy!
B003F3NDP8|5.0|I love having the entire season of one of the best shows ever.  If you loved Desperate Housewives, you will love having there DVDs to look at when nothing is good on TV and you just want to watch something.
0800141660|5.0|Emma Thompson proves herself to be a masterful director and actress.  This production has a little more sophistication to its style than previous renditions.  That is most likely due to the better technical production equipment, etc.  The music was one of my favorite parts.  Marianne was romantic still but not quite as outspoken and petulant as earlier versions presented her except when it came to Willoughby.  This version is true to the story line with some condensation of information but it is a wonderful happy ever after movie with beautiful music.  Delightful and never boring.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|In the vein of 80's action, the first 5-minutes is pure action.  It's a test for the viewer as well... accept what you see, or be in for a painful ride.<br />If you can accept the spot-on accuracy and infinite ammo/endurance of the heroes, you'll have a fun viewing experience. :)<br />And let me just say, Jean Claude really shows up.  He was superb. Really, a better villain, purely performance-wise, than the movie needed or deserved.<br />When it ended I just hoped to see him get another role like that where he can really bring it.
B0019IB0II|5.0|Awesome book.  Great read. I had a right frontal AVM had to have surgery. The book really helped me understand. It also helped me take care of my boyfriend's mother. She had a stroke recently.
B0054SMID0|3.0|Somehow I did not understood the end. It was good plot and the performances were good too but the end was very abrupt and beyond comprehension. Could be better.
B00COO2D6O|4.0|A great defender game, that has a hint of comedy. Also it has a wide variety of missions and levels.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|I would expect this to be previous 007 style statement movie but it disappointed. Overall OK movie but lacks in 007 quotient. Did not impress me much. I am still stuck to Pierce Brosnan as a Bond.
B00CW665VI|5.0|OMG! I so LOVED this book! I've read a lot of books lately and this was so wonderfully different. I loved Drew! It was fun. It was serious. It was AWESOME!
0307895475|5.0|With this guide you can manage your tasks, abilities, quests and get a lot of help. Ok, you can have a lot of help from wikias and forums on internet but not in this beautiful way. It have some maps of caves and dungeons too.

1434440826|5.0|This book is amazing. There is so many things I didn't know. I am learning a different thing each time I pick up this book. You subconscious has so much power and you learn how to use it so you feel better about yourself. So amazing!
B002SR2PKG|3.0|A good (if a bit ripe and overwrought) Stephen King doorstop filled with everything but the kitchen sink (and, in fact, a bathroom sink thrown in for good measure, as readers of the book can attest). \\"It\\" is the story of a group of kids fighting unimaginable evil in Maine, in 1958, paired with the story of those same kids as adults in 1985 brought back together to fight that evil one more time. Stephen King writes great books (11/22/63, The Stand, The Dead Zone, Night Shift, The Shining) and he writes ridiculously over the top and silly books (Christine, and too many more to mention). \\"It\\" manages to be both at the same time - you will occasionally groan, but you will not stop reading as your fingers grow weary from turning pages (or flipping through your Kindle). If the last 200 pages had been as good as the first 1000 or so, this would have been a five star review. But the end did not live up to the promise, and became needlessly \\"shocking\\" rather than meaningful
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I think this is s good game and I think every body should play it u would love it I promise u
B003UYUP58|4.0|Make no mistake, this is a work of an incredible intellect, and something that everyone should read.  But there is little question that the book does drag, and while the stories buries within the narrative are never less than engrossing, the tale of research developing in fits and starts must (for historical accuracy) seem repetitive.  That said, anyone who thinks they understand the role that cancer has had in our culture needs to read it, and be amazed at the deep roots it has in our collective psyche.
B00CW665VI|4.0|O.m.g,  I so HATED Drew and his womanizing ways..but I could see so many men being just like him..and as I had hoped he would so meet his match HE does in spades..and like a movie I once watched the guy talked about how most men won't respect women who just give it up so freely..gotta make them work for it..in the movie the women had a playbook to go by and it worked like a charm, oh yeah Steve Harvey..was the author of that book and the guy behind that movie..loved that movie..I so loved how clever Kate was and how she put Drew through the ringer..HE DESERVED IT and more!! I loved all their antics and the male view..the real in your face here is how we think take it or leave it consequences..everyone gets \\" schooled\\" sometime in life whether it's in college or later in some way or another..and after ya learn the hard way reality bites sometimes you walk around a better person ,not so blind..I'm a firm believer in what comes around goes around..and so glad Drew got his so much needed \\"wake up \\" call..I loved little Mackenzie, so adorable!! There is a much needed lesson to be learned from this..because all humor aside..there are alot of men out there just like Drew, very good story here- WELL DONE.
0143117009|2.0|Book report: Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, by Jared Diamond<br /><br />Having read Diamond's phenomenal \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" I was looking forward to reading \\"Collapse.\\" GG&S was a brilliant analysis of why European and Asian societies came to dominate the rest of the world. This success was ultimately deduced from the effects of geography, with all of the logic and inevitability of the proof of a theorem in geometry.<br /><br />I expected the same kind of sharp analysis in Collapse, but I was very disappointed. This book is a rambling, anecdote-laden presentation of certain cherry-picked historical societies like Norse Greenland, Easter Island, the Mayans, the Anasazi, and modern Montana, where Diamond regularly vacations. His main point seems to be that societies that don't take care of their natural resources - especially their trees - collapse, sometimes very suddenly.<br /><br />Okay, certainly a good point, but one that could have been presented far more succinctly than this 608-page paperback. This book cries out for a good editing. Do we really need to know about Diamond's sons' fishing guides in Montana? Is it necessary to hear about his bird-watching trips to New Guinea? I skipped large sections of narration and still felt like I had wasted a LOT of time.<br /><br />My suggestion, if you're curious about what he has to say, is to skip to the summary chapter at the end, unless you have some particular interest in one of the societies he highlights.<br /><br />It seems extremely ironic that, given his theme, he didn't try to save a few trees.<br /><br />Recommendation: skip to the end.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|That was the only thing I could say after finishing this book. I read it in one sitting without a break and was enthralled until the final page. Yes, it was graphic. Yes, it was disturbing. But it was all necessary for creating the atmosphere of the book and I didn't find any of it to be gratuitous. The majority of the negative reviews on this book that I saw were from people who probably shouldn't have been reading a book of this nature in the first place. It is very well written and doesn't shy away from anything bordering on the unthinkable. But then again, if that is the type of book you are looking to read, why would you want the book to shrink away from things that may be uncomfortable to read about and thereby sacrifice the quality of the book? It's unfair to rate such a well thought-out novel poorly simply because you had too weak of a stomach to appreciate it for what it is.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its way better than temple run some people still play that stupid game. its the best
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|I have always been a Paul Anka fan so when this compliation came out where he did duets with some of my other favourite artists I thought it was great. I live in Australia and we don't often get these cd's without a lot of searching, so I was very pleased to be able to go to Amazon and buy nearly whatever I want. I love this cd.
B00CL66FEQ|4.0|Since we are not usually Streisand fans, we were surprised at how funny she was in her role in this move!

B005LW5J9O|3.0|I study Greek and Roman history as a hobby and enjoy seeing how the ancients have put their mark on subsequent history and culture.  From that perspective, this book was a success.  The story of the rediscovery of Lucretius was interesting, particularly the discussion of the political situation at the time.  What was less successful was the part of the book that tried to make the case that On the Nature of Things was responsible for &#34;How the World Became Modern&#34;.  There were several stories of individuals who had persevered in their beliefs that the world was made of atoms and the soul died with the body (a la Lucretius) in the face of (ultimately) death.  Also, many  early Renaissance literary references to Lucretius or his philosophy were highlighted.  But this section was rather thin and unconvincing in my mind.  I think the author over-promised and under-produced.  Nonetheless, this is an interesting thesis and is a worthwhile read.
B00BESM14U|2.0|It was less about a wallflower and more about sexual discovery. But then I'm a parent trying to keep my kids innocent.
B004SKJTY6|4.0|Enjoyable cast mixed well with historical interest.  Definitely worth watching for Colin Firth's academy award winning performance and for a one sided glimpse into the abdication of Edward VIII.
B004TMPJP6|1.0|I installed this app as a basic to-do-list. I was very hesitant when the installation stated that the app would have access to lots of private information such as my contacts etc.. Anyway, I thought all apps may do that and I had to get something, so I downloaded it.<br /><br />After installation, it wanted me to 'activate' an account. I am not interested in sharing lists with anybody, so I skipped that. It worked fine for a few weeks. The app allowed me to enter some basic stuff as I would use post-it note, like entering that I needed to pick something up from the post office, get an oil change or whatever. Then the new version of the app with a new user agreement became available. I do not recall initiating this download myself. Anyway, first thing the app made me do is log into the app on my phone and wanting me to invite sharing the lists others. A couple of hours later I could not use it any more because I was timed out. For a super basic app this is just too much hassle and got rid of it quickly afterwards.<br /><br />I have now downloaded another to-do-list app called [[ASIN:B004JZBGWI ColorNote Notepad Notes]]. It is simple and userfriendly and the privacy setting seems much better with no access to my contacts.
B001K3EXTA|3.0|Follows the novel well and is true to the characters of the novel. Much better than the new release in 2013.
B001OSIV62|4.0|An amazing look at one man's obsession. The lengths to which he went to plan, and his ability to draw friends and acquaintances into this obsession are fascinating. The views from the top of the towers truly frightening. Although he reached his goal, his treatment of his friends afterward is a bit disturbing and sad.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Great acting and judicial storylines however the ongoing legal and jail time of Alicia's husband Peter got a little old and convoluted by the end of the season. And the Calinda character is becoming too unknowable and caricature-like - we need to see more of how she got to be the way she is and why she is so hardened. A little romance and trust would be an interesting development for her character, IMO. Also the storyline with the kids at home, covering up stuff from their mom is getting a bit old as well.  But good show overall!
B00ADGSIRS|5.0|These cuts were put together from ideas and fragments accumulated over some years, according to Bartos.  They often have the sequencer and drum machine pulse of much of Kraftwerk's sound, but with more personal, vocoder-treated lyrics.  Bartos even waxes melancholy on why he can't quite believe in God, which is a bit of a departure from Kraftwerk's cool, detached irony.  And some of the more instrumental cuts, like Musica Ex Machina, are really wonderful.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I downloaded this out of curiosity when it was the FAOTD. I figured it might help me with insomnia. I was  impressedwith the sound quality and the variety of the sound clips. Some of them should be longer. When you start to anticipate the next sound due to excessive repetition, it gets irritating. A more sophisticated programming option would make this even better. I'm thinking of creating longer playlists that sequence your favorites.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What a wonderful story and cast. The entertainment value is 10+ on a 10 point scale. Believeble - informative - qualuity entertainment - what more could you desire?
B004L9MFM2|5.0|This book continues on from where book 1 left off.  Great characters and writing - makes you feel like you are there
B006WPSQVC|4.0|I watched this based on Fireproof.  Fireproof and this story was recommender by the wife of my Pastor.  It is good moral programing.
B002KGEORM|5.0|being able to watch these episodes one after the other is good and bad....hate to stop watching, but gotta sleep some time
1616550414|5.0|Both of my sons are Legend of Zelda fans, and this book is apparently a compendium of all things Zelda.  A little overwhelming for non-Zelda people, it is beautiful nonetheless.

B00BQPEIT2|4.0|My grandchild can play this at 5 years old, puts me to shame.  It doesn't hold her interet for too long but she keeps returning to it.  More difficult for me but I do enjoy trying to beat her.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|I bought this for my mom who has a hard time hearing TV. She says that it words really well.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I find the TED talks interesting and informative. The format is good and the subjects varied. A great program for short , inspirational messages. I like it very much.
B005NNVUBM|5.0|My keyboard is meltimg! So much cool stuff on here ya dont knle where to begin. Answers a lot of questions.
1574214276|4.0|I appreciate the way this book introduces zentangle to &#34;newbies.&#34; I think this is what many people need, including me. No erasers allowed, if you make a mistake, work it into your pattern.  Isn't this what God does with our lives? Ann
B001SKB1Y0|3.0|Shot  against backdrop Gaudi's many distinctive buildings and public sculptures, Woody Allen's ode to Barcelona is a fun ride.  The acting is not exceptional but reserved.  Woody chooses not to narrate this feature, which throws you a bit. This film is worth viewing especially if you have been to or plan to go to Barcelona.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It is like farmville but better!!! We have been playing this game for 3 hours and this is the first time I have &quot;stepped&quot; away from the game.
B000FA675C|5.0|Read several times and i always pick up on things I missed. It's an amazingly detailed book that is a real must read conspiracy novel!
B005UG542S|5.0|this is a great movie and i hope everyone has a chance to watch it i have watched it multiple time and i plan to watch the series all the way through again and again
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Don't like this download, maybe I just haven't used it as much as I could.  I've never liked Bing, and it comes up all the time when I search, still don't like Bing.  I just need to find the right Google Search to download.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|i have 1,2,3,4, and now season 5. this is one of my favorit, alltime works, that i am so happy to finally have on dvd!  thank you amazon for being there ,and continueing the complete episode. along with supernatural,my favorit episodes ever!
B004I744AS|5.0|I'm always using the dictionary spelling or definitions, also has a feature to hear the word pronounced if one needs and the word is unfamiliar.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It is a story about the stories Pi told about being the sole survivor of a ship that sank in the western Pacific.. How it came to be that he was on that ship. How a storm sank that ship. How he, the sole survivor, survived for months alone crossing the Pacific to eventually make landfall in Mexico. It is a story, too, about an author listening to Pi tell the stories. Layers upon layers that take the reader on fantastic voyages. Which story do you like best? Does that matter?
B00B0NDF26|1.0|Clambering to electronic mind numbing pop, this alum is void of everything that has made Tegan and Sara an inspired gripping indie band in the past. It might hit the charts and be featured on daytime television but in doing so it lacks any of the substance and musicality you have come to expect from a Tegan and Sara album. Sadly it is a huge disappointment. Let us hope that this alum isn't the first in the ever familiar steady decline main stream media usually decays fantastic indie bands to.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I totally recommend this app. It's super addictive. I love to pin random stuff. This app shows you things other people like and it gives you ideas for a new craft project. :)
B00B9366VO|5.0|Dave Grohl's (Foo Fighters/Nirvana) project to document the history of Sound City and the great albums created there is an amazing film.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|This game used to be a lot of fun. I was super excited to unlock the under water park. I have had this app for a few months and the under water park for at least a month and I still only have 1 fish. I have grown the park and gone on SEVERAL expeditions but still no Dino-fish. It frustrates me because I keep getting shrimp to feed the next Dino-fish but I have nothing to give it to. Please fix this. Other than that the other park is fine. I love the variety of the dinosaurs, they`'re the same ones in the movie!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Jack Reacher stories.  Very disappointed with Lee Child's choice of actor to play Reacher, but still love the books
B009NY43NY|2.0|I was very disappionted in the book. She changed so many of the characters personalities. I felt she did't hold true to the characters. The way that she wrote Eric and that part of the story was a huge disappiontment it did not make any sense at all if you know the character of Eric at all. The ending was also very disappionting. I felt like more could have been added maybe a couple of years down the road to see if all her wishes for the future came true. There was no romance or any build up to who she ended up with if you could say that she ended up with him. I was really lookinf forward to this book since it was the end and it was a total waste of time.
B000065V3H|5.0|This movie is great.  Patrick Dempsey is such a cutie in this movie.  I have been searching for awhile and I found it on Amazon for a great price.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Could not put it down. One of the best books I have read in recent years. I was thoroughly drawn in by the story. Well worthy of the Pulitzer price
B003V5ED7W|4.0|Great movie for teen-ish and up.  Only a few words that I would rather have not been there.  Great story of accomplishment with good humor.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|Like everybody else, I think this is a great version of Les Mis. I normally never write reviews, but the reason for writing this review is to demonstrate the level of customer service from Amazon. After about 1week I noticed a few scratches in one of the CDs. It had skipped the same part from the get-go, but I never bothered to check the CD. There were 3 major scratches in the CD when I checked it and I reported it on Amazon's web site. The next day I had a new CD and the return process of the old CD was 100x easier than having to go down to a store to return something. Amazing customer service.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|GREAT READ!!!! If u are in to mystery and mythology then this is a perfect book for you to read!!
B00CKJTVHW|5.0|Dex is Dex, some will get it, some won't ... Do not start in the middle. Much better from the start.
B000LJ9ZWO|3.0|Saw this when I was a wee lad, and had memories of it being \\"cool and scary\\".  Watching this again for the first time since the 70's, what I found most interesting is how - in my very young age - I completely missed the focus on these fantasy worlds being so wrapped up in fantasy sex.  Also, they never showed what happened to the dude in the glasses who took on the sheriff role. Did he get out?  Anyways, fun and campy nowa'days, but certainly a classic.
0440241901|5.0|I have read this book three separate times now.  Each time I come back to it, I get a little more out of it!  This book is the quintessential, light, funny, chick-lit, novel that you just can't put down.  Each time I have fell in love with the main characters just a little bit more and reveled in their blossoming love.  I can totally relate to the awkward moments.  I literally laughed out loud uproariously and smiled often.  If you are looking for a great book for vacation or just to de-stress, I highly recommend this one!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The novel was on the best seller list so I thought it would be outstanding.  It was just not to my taste.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|So far this is easily my album of the year. Its only June but I seriously doubt anything will pass for a better record the rest of the year, but who knows at this point.<br />Steve morse guitar work is great. Of course the rhythm section is rock solid like all DP records. What really stands out to me is Don Aireys keyboards.....outstanding!<br />It's also nice to hear Ian Guillan has not lost his voice at his age.<br />Easily 5 stars!
B005MJ883K|5.0|Our grandson opened his Perplexus as his 8th birthday gift during a Skype conversation with us. He usually has a lot to say and enjoys Skyping us. But, after he opened his Perplexus, he couldn't put it down and had trouble diverting his attention to our questions. The free bag wasn't made quite big enough, and he couldn't get it over the Perplexus, but that had nothing to do with his enjoyment of the device.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Left Me Wanting So Much More! !<br />Fun Combination Of Escape Play And The App - Floors.<br />Not As Dif As Floors, Ididnt Need Any Hints, But Quick Fun And Free.
193700788X|5.0|I really liked the way the series ended.  I have been a faithful reader and was excited to read this one.  I stayed up until 2 AM Sunday morning after getting the book Saturday afternoon and still couldn't finish, but when I did finish on Sunday afternoon I was really satisfied with the ending. I will miss Sookie a lot. I found her to be an interesting and likable character. I think I will start over, just to avoid withdrawal until the \\"what happened after\\" comes out in October.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|Loved it! Humor, romance & a bit of sadness. A lot of emotion going on in this movie. Very entertaining.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I am still getting used to the speed of the movie. I usually watch a lot of action movies and shows so I am used to things happening faster. Amazing effects and make up.... I haven't seen anything better regarding zombies
B00992CF6W|5.0|There are two modes survival and creative. On creative you are  immortal like God<br />So you can make bricks infinitely  and fly. On survival you have to get bricks<br />And stuff you need to get wooden tools so you can mine stone and then get iron<br />Then get gold witch sucks then you get diamonds night  monsters come  out<br /><br />So you need to make a shelter
B00CW665VI|5.0|PERFECT! This book was incredible, I had to check the author twice for gender, what insight!  Seriously, I couldn't put it down. Funny? I should have been embarrassed for laughing out loud so much, but I just didn't care. Really, it didn't read like any book I've come across.  The reader is more of a close friend during a crisis then well, a reader picking up a book. Thanks for taking us along for the ride!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|very addicting. gotta get 3 stars on each layout. I usually run out of battery before I'm finished playing. gotta go play some more.
B002ZG9788|5.0|The visual effects are great. As a kid I loved greek mythology. Moves right along.  Anyway very entertaining, will watch again!
B009RH9FR6|5.0|It does what it's supposed to do. Well made and designed. I'd recommend this to anyone with a Kindle. Really.
B0093FNZT6|4.0|Dr even provides evidence both from a scientific and an out of body experience viewpoint, that we are more than just matter. He is able to reconstruct his experience in detail, then analytically explain reasons why his experience is so unique from a medical perspective, and how it changed his view of the spiritual self, and the existence of heaven. His colleagues must have found his experiences very confronting, as it would have challenged the very core of their scientific and deeply held belief systems
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Couldn't get this one off my mind for a  long time.  Although it's fiction, it made me think about genes vs. environment in an entirely new way.  I literally couldn't put it down and would read it while I was stopped at red lights in the car.  I JUST HAD TO KNOW!!!!!!!!!!
B009AMANBA|4.0|The movie is an interesting account of Lincoln's final four months.  The movie, however, is a little slow and draggy.  There is no disputing that Day-Lewis is outstanding at channeling Lincoln.  He carefully accepts his roles and any movie with him is a must see.  He is an excellent actor who can transform himself into the character he portrays.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I got this thing to replace my old Razer Deathadder mouse (nothing was wrong with it - I just wanted something new).<br /><br />This thing is much better than that old Deathadder. It feels much better in my hand and has many more features for less cost.<br />Feels very sturdy and I have been using it every day for over three months and there is no sign of wear!<br />The many extra buttons really help in games like Starcraft.<br />If you are in the market for a new gaming mouse, save some money and get this instead of the Deathadder!<br /><br />The only con I can think of is that you cannot change the color of the wheel. It stays blue.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|The visual aspect of this game is incredible... wish there really was a yellow brick road like that to go walking, jogging, lol.
B00065JTBA|5.0|This is a birthday gift for my mom, she's been a Bon Jovi fan forever, she is very excited to hear all these unreleased songs!. The package came in perfect conditions inside and outside. I'm very happy with my purchase.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play this every day. Very addicting. Totally worth trying out. Freezes occasionally but other than that its perfect. Recommend.it
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|it is a lot of fun!!! like a Sim city game only better because it has DINOSAURS! even helps with my management skills I'm learning in schho.
B00C3MKCIS|5.0|I saw this band play their 1st concert in Montreal in March, when they opened for Marillion. I knew they had a great deal of potential and was looking forward to getting this album. From the day I received the CD in the mail, I have listened to it any chance I get. My 1st listen was with headphones, which I highly recommend. The depth of the music is amazing, and the music is in my head all the time, which is a good thing! I love the way the album flows together. Cosmic Distance Ladder has some parts which remind me of Alan Parsons, but with more intense drumming. I really can't say any part of the album I do not like. Hannah Stobart's vocals on Beyond Illumination are wonderful, Dave Kerzner is a genius, Simon's vocals and drumming are great! I got my wife and daughter to listen to Only Breathing Out with headphones, and they agreed. Having loved progressive rock most of my life, it is wonderful to have a new band I am so into. I hope they make many more albums.....I am ready now! I cannot wait to see them live here in the States. Knowing the album will make it an incredible show. I want to see them as often as I can before they are doing the stadium tours.......
B00COGY2P2|2.0|I have read all of Vince Flynn Jack Reacher novels. Most of them 2 times and some 3 times. Tom Cruise is no Jack Reacher.. Mr Cruise's body is not large enough. His acting is 2nd class. The characters were not very believe able and the dialog was flat. Somebody like Justin Strahan would make a much better Reacher. He is much more &#34; macho &#34; His screen presence fits more like Reacher presence  in Flynn's. novels
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Not sure why this got any bad reviews.  It was a little slow at first, but not in an uninteresting way...more like you just didn't know what was going to happen.  I really enjoyed this movie and I highly recommend it.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Does not load.  Not just mine, my daughter cannot load it either.  Try fixing it or something will you, ok
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|If you are a fan of the show, you will love this season!  Once again, the series has reinvented itself while keeping the exciting action, plot twists and turns, and unpredictable characters we love.  Sam and Dean remain surprisingly fresh characters after all these seasons, as they grow and mature as young men of this age should.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fun game to play. It is challenging and it does not get old. Have fun playing this game for hours on end.
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|I've been looking forward to &#34;this&#34; movie (didn't know it was going to be called &#34;The Last Stand&#34;) for a long time. Arnold growing older, and as I expected, with style. Great movie.<br /><br />I only wish Peter Stormare was getting locked into stereotypical roles!
B000FCKPHG|5.0|One of the most helpful books I've ever read. I was isolated and afraid of the world before I read this book. After I read it, I realized the world is full of opportunities for me to improve rather than full of chances for failure. If I hadn't read this, I would probably be stuck in the same rut. I've recommended this book to people and they could all instantly relate to the concept. So crucial to read for parents, teachers, or anyone really.<br /><br />Please, if you are hesitating, read this book. It's not a self help book, it's a book that studies mindsets and shows you the pros and cons of both. Rereading this book again now.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|Alan Tudyk has been a favorite of mine since &#34;Firefly&#34;. Then &#34;A Knight's Tale&#34;, &#34;I Robot&#34;, &#34;Serenity&#34; ( :-( ), &#34;3:1- to Yuma&#34;.<br /><br />But &#34;Tucker & Dale&#34; was hysterical! What a great performance!
B000ZMCVRI|2.0|This is a CD I have loved for years and so I downloaded it to workout by.  I am frustrated that it will suddenly pause and sometimes even stop playing during my workout.  I do not like having to stop to see what is going on and then reset my music to keep playing.  Great music but very frustrating.
B000W9DSVW|4.0|Great set of movies. Loved them. Started over with &#34;11&#34; with my son and watch all three in one sitting. He's a believer now as well.
B001DPDVE8|4.0|I've seen some of the TV shows as reruns, and I enjoyed this.  There were a few strange parts (I guess that's to be expected), but if you liked the show then this is worth watching (although not a must-see).
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|I couldn't believe Tom Cruise was going to play 6'5&#34; Jack Reacher. But, as Lee Child says in the special feature: Size we can get beyond, it's how dedicated to the role Tom was that made it work. Loved it.<br /><br />(I watched it with my son and exclaimed: &#34;That's Lee Child&#34;!!! when his cameo occurred. By the special feature comments, most Reacher Creatures did likewise.))<br /><br />Plus!!!, Robert Duvall is WONDERFUL!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Brilliant game good and fun to play , excellent for killing time.  I would recommend download and try it cause you may like it.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Ok I love this game and om nom is the cutest thing ever the only bad thing is I won't get my homework done anytime soon.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I liked the book, but was upset with some of the events that happened. I did not like the ending, but the ending does give the third book something to be about. It was still a great book. I still liked the first one the best. I think young adult book readers would like it.
B00CATSONE|1.0|Yes it has some info about Tesla but it's all about preaching & motivating.  But hey, that's what happens when you get something for free.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I can't describe what I felt when watching this, as anything but self realization and well being. This is hands down the most beautiful story. I have ever seen. Not everybody will understand this movie (as shown by narrow minded critics in reviews) but if you are one who treasure the base story of humanity in its most beautiful form, then I leave the decision for you.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|James has done it again.<br /><br />Reading Choose Yourself was the best use of 4 hours of my life in the last 5 years.  He's right, he's keenly insightful into the way things are, and perhaps most of all, the way we really think about things.  He understands what makes us hesitate and stall while constantly and light-heartedly pushing us to rethink the world and our individual place in it.<br /><br />Our icons have failed, the promises of the past ways of life will remain forever unfulfilled, the rules are not what they were and most people are without a game board.  James gives us a new way of thinking and acting into a world in transition that can propel our careers and, more importantly our lives, to new and better heights.<br /><br />Thanks, James.
1401307450|5.0|Totally in love with Anthony Kiedis.<br /><br />the writing style of the book is so in his tongue, I love how you can read it as if he's telling it himself. it's raw and real and I'm more in love with him than I was in before
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is convient for shopping. I can keep up with my purchases and do not go over my budget. Can't do without it.
B005IQZB14|4.0|At one point she is expecting to arrive at a water tower that is supposed to have something in it, but it doesn't. I don't remember if it was connected with this potentially life-threatening situation, but she had to purify muddy water in order to get enough to drink.<br /><br />Her descriptions of the Pacific Crest Trail make you realize how much more difficult it is to traverse than the Appalachian Trail, which is no picnic itself from what I've read. There are a lot fewer chances on the PCT to walk out and re-supply.<br /><br />How she made it, I'll never know. She had that need to find herself, yet was unable to foresee how difficult it might be and how she might have been better prepared herself for it.<br /><br />I saw in Cheryl's bio that she is now married. I had to wonder how the episodes of casual sex she recounts might have affected how her husband and children think of her.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This  book takes the reader on an emotional journey through the lives of two individuals lives who become intertwined by much more than a high school romance. This book certainly keeps the reader engaged - keep the tissues on hand!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|You definitely have to really think on this one! I love it so far, very different from the others. A lot of thought has to go into it. At my age it helps me remember, where or what does this go... a test of memory. Going on 60 it's exactly what I needed! Just to keep my mind with the adventure and memory.<br />I love it so far, fun and adventurous at every turn. Not real easy but nothing that can't be accomplished.<br />So good!!! Great game...
B00886XQO0|5.0|At first i was skeptical at buying these expensive headphones but after using them for a few weeks i do not regret buying them. They are very confortable and you can adjust them length wise and turn the earcups forward and backwards, great quality sound and mic, battery life is about 8 hours for (tho other users have said between 6-10) and if it does die you can still plug in the usb charger and still use them. The only complaint is the setup was a little tricky between my xbox and phone.
B00BTJMS1A|3.0|This game is a Match 3 game but with an RPG/Adventure twist that slightly alters the game.  The goal is to get 10,000,000 points, which you accumulate by going through various levels of a dungeon.<br /><br />Every time you play, you accumulate points (which finishes the game), Gold, Lumber, Experience, and Stone.<br /><br />Gold is used to upgrade your equipment.<br />Experience is used to add \\"bonuses\\" to the game.<br />Lumber and Stone are used to upgrade the shops, which gives you better upgrades for your equipment.<br /><br />This game was fun at first and it definitely gives you a nice change compared to most Match 3 games, but it gets really repetitive after a while.  You see, as you progress through each dungeon the monsters get tougher & tougher. To equalize that, you have to upgrade your equipment & obtain the bonuses.  What I noticed after playing the game all the way through, is that the game scales with the equipment and becomes no different really than when you first played.  For example at the start, you have your standard equipment and you take considerable damage.  Moving to each dungeon thereafter means you MUST upgrade your equipment, otherwise you get killed too quickly.  What you will find is that you have to \\"grind\\" the previous levels or the one you're working on over & over until you have enough gold to buy your upgrades.<br /><br />Also, the \\"achievements\\" that are at every level are simply for you to find means to acquire the resources faster.  It has no bearing on progressing to the next dungeon.<br /><br />With all that said, the game is fun but is highly repetitive and after you're done, I would find it hard to play over again.  To me, the game has no replay value.
0316286850|5.0|This book is beautifully done, great ideas and how to sections.  Book is worth every penny, what a talented artist he was!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I've read all of Dan Brown's books and controversies aside, they're both entertaining and thought provoking.  Robert Langdon is once again thrust into a great mystery with the clock running.  His mentor has been kidnapped and the kidnapper has sent him on a mission to find the lost symbol of the masons.  I have to admit that the twist of who Malach really was was pretty obvious.  In the end the story turns into a pretty long discussion about man's ascension to... Something greater... And that &#34;non fiction&#34; portion was what I found most interesting.  Overall, another winner by Brown.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|Love this on my computer.  Now that I have it on my kindle, I can play anywhere my kindle goes.  Relaxing and challenging at the same time.  I enjoy games where I have to problem solve and this does it.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Isabel Allende said of Khaleid Hosseini after reading “The Kite Runner”  - “This is one of those unforgettable stories that stay with you for years. All the great themes of literature and of life are the fabric of this extraordinary novel: love, honor, guilt, fear redemption.... It is so powerful that for a long time everything I read after seemed bland.&#34;<br />And the Mountains Echoed once again affirms that Khaled Hosseini is a master at his storytelling craft.  He begins and ends the books with one simple story of love & commitment between siblings (a girl and a boy), but weaves in other stories that affected this love, characters as they grow from childhood into adulthood.  The story takes us from the rural to the urban areas of Afghanistan, San Francisco and the Greek Islands of Tinos.<br />He craftily uses oral tradition to draw parallels between the story and an old Afghan traditional tale – where in old tales, even the DIV’s are good, kind, well-meaning characters.  In the “real life” tale, the story bruises and injures, but ultimately the simple message of love finds its way back into the narration.<br />When the little girl Pari is lost to the simple rural Afghanistan family we hungrily look for consolation and atonement in the story and finds “I took solace only in hope.  Hope that perhaps, wherever she is now, she has found as much peace, grace, love and happiness as this world allows” .  It resonates with us all as we love and loose our loved ones to another “life” or death even.<br />I read the book, hoping that with each page there would be the reconciliation of the siblings, to right a wrong – or hoping that there would be absolution for the acts of the adults in separating the siblings - in itself as the fable suggests earlier on in the book, that the “lost child” in the fable had gone to a happier place having no memory at all of his family – and the Div gives the father a choice, to either take the child back withhim or leave the child in his “happy place” and return to the rest of his family.  As a good loving father, he chooses what he believes is best for the child.  Khaled’s story is more realistic, reflecting the painful human stories that unfolded in Afghanistan and its effects on all.  In the end, I could not clearly judge the actions of the father and the adults involved in the separation of the siblings Pari and Abdullah.  “One thing I have come to see is that one is well served by a degree of both humility and charity when judging the inner workings of another person’s heart.”<br />The inclusion of the vivid characters such as Timur and Idris is welcoming, illustrating the divide of those returning from exhale, and those who were remained behind to experience the harshness of the war, the poverty and the suffering.  The two chracters clearly illustrates the ramifications of the Afghan diaspora, however, I am disappointed that we did not read more of the people in Afghanistan who remained behind, e.g. the ordinary people Iqbal’s son.  The characters who remained behind and benefited through corruption exploiting the ordinary people is clearly illustrated.  I hope we read more about the character Adel the son of Commander Sahib, Iqbal’s son  and Pari the daughter of Abdullah in a next book.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|For the money this mouse will be hard to beat. It has a very nice feel to it while gaming and the control it gives you is solid. The DPI adjustment is right on the money and the tracking is flawless. I use it for playing games like world of tanks,A10 warthog and a lot of other games. I really like it as much as my cooler master inferno. I even like the soft ware and have had no issues with it at all.(Note: You will download the software from the Anker website after you plug in your mouse)..It takes around 30 seconds or so and you have total control over your mouse after the download and installation..<br />I liked it so well I have ordered another one and plan to add them to the other 3 gaming pc's I have. Even if your not a gamer don't overlook this mouse it's as good as all of the others I have had and some even cost a lot more.<br />On 6-7 2013 I had an issue with the scroll wheel on the second mouse I ordered and after I did the review I was contacted by Anker about the issue.<br />This was the first seller to contact me ever about an issue after they had my money.<br />They are shipping me a replacement mouse and letting me send the mouse I had issues with back at no charge to me after I get the replacement mouse.  I have ordered a lot of pc parts over the years and I have had a few issues with some of them but this is the first time anyone called me to see how they could make the issue right and make sure I have a truly flawless working product.<br />I have found Anker to be a solid seller to order from and that they do care about any issues you have with their products even after they get your money. This is a very rare thing these days and I have found very few sellers with this kind of performance after the sell.<br />For the money you will not find a better seller or product service and you can pay more for a gaming mouse and get way less. So think it over and order from a seller you can trust to have your back if you have product issues even after they have your money..<br />The mouse is well worth the money and has solid gaming performance. With such seller support after the sell you can't go wrong with his mouse..
B007KQ6XYY|2.0|This looked like fun but there's not directions so i have absolutely no idea how to play.  I guess it's a secret!  Anyway - wouldn't recommend it unless you know what it is.
B009JBZH54|5.0|one of the best movie of all time. batman is a epic movie. good for collector. great choice. good product.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I hesitated to read this book because some of the reviews described it as a sad, depressing book.<br /><br />It wasn't. Now of course, the main character in this book had a very rough childhood in the foster care system, and emerged from it severely emotionally damaged. BUT ... any allusion to the mistreatment she was subject to was mentioned only briefly, in a sentence or so. The actual scenes in the book are full of hope and unconditional love.<br /><br />The book alternates between Victoria's modern day life as an 18-year old working in a flower shop, and as a 10-year old placed in her last foster home. In both story lines, she spends her days with people who work fiercely to provide her with love and a support network, who persist in their efforts to reach her even as she closes herself off to them.<br /><br />I think the author did a very good job of not being overly sentimental. I've read some books where I've felt like the author is pounding me over the head trying to make me pity a certain character, or loath another one, but in this book I felt very open to making my own judgments about each of the characters and their actions.<br /><br />And ironically, it's often the ones who don't seem like they're trying too hard that end up getting you all weepy. I'll admit, I cried at the end of this book, and I believe it is only the second book that's made me cry in the last three years (the first book was The Fault in Our Stars).<br /><br />I will say it was a bummer when it ended. I like to linger over good books, and I didn't realize that the last few pages were a flower dictionary, so it was disappointing when I thought I had another 12 pages or so but it turned out I was done with the book. But I guess that's the mark of a good book, that you don't want it to end.
B00BQ1D7X4|3.0|Every time I try to bash this album while listening to it, I start liking it more. I think most of the people who give this album 5 stars are new to AiC, but I have been a fan since Facelift and this album is growing on me more so than did Black Gives Way although I like a few songs on Black Gives Way. I know that no singer can put me down in hole while sitting in my angry chair like Layne could, but I do appreciate the effort Jerry, new singer Duvall (who is not the son of Robert Duvall) and former band members are putting out there. I would rather have this than no new Alice in Chains music at all. So I am just gonna leave it at that for now. Maybe I will add to this review after I have more time with it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great continuation of a wonderful story.  Loving every minute of it.  Can't wait for the next episode!  Wanted to sit and watch every episode at once!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Even my 3 year old lives to play and match the tiles.  I feel it really helps her.<br />  I love this game and enjoy all the puzzles.
B0084HJE0S|4.0|There isn't anything technical in this read, but if you we're wondering how the two technologies interact with each other and want to get an overview and examples of capabilities, this is a good read. It took me about 15min to read through, but definitely underscored the importance of the two in the use of the web today and how it will be used 'tomorrow'.<br /><br />For a free book and a good overview, I recommend it.
B005V5WBFG|2.0|For the price this should have been the be all end all of mobile security however it made my apps & messaging run slower & didn't really do anything else.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|Never have any problems getting my email in this app.  Works great.  Pulls up fast and the emails are always loaded fast
0316113077|3.0|The book is good, but ver poorly photografed.<br />I don't understand why someone decides to share their knowledge and suddenly change mind...it's ice cold water dropping over your head on a winter night...I expected to get at least the cover cake, but she only show us a few...draws ! Yes, four small draws: two about the handle, one about the lap and one about the doweling. No picture of the step by step, only lots of texts....<br />This book coast double price if compared to others, which are much more helpful if you are curious about how to, like the The Contemporary Cake Decorating Bible by Lindy Smith.<br /><br />There are some intressant recipes, but once more, no picture to relate at, so you may end up with something totally diferent fom what it was supposed to achive.<br />Maybe this is an advanced book and I am just not there yet.
B004G7UTXG|5.0|I attempted to put on cue to watch later in evening then could not access - signed up for prime for instant access to this and other movies but alas the typical bait and switch deal. No luck in getting it on from cue and no luck trying to re-try search as search said unavailable.<br />So. . . . . what's up with that.  Will likely cancel if no response from amazon.<br />edit: after a lovely chat with a very helpful technical suport person, all was resolved, turns out it was a momentary issue of connectivity, it was available all along. Just needed to try again.  Very Happy with amazon customer/technical support!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Compares in quality with Intelligence and The Killing.  The plot is amply complex, the acting is excellent, the directing superb.
B00C4QD5IW|5.0|This is definitely a chick flick, but it's a good one!  The story is plausible and well done.  I would recommend this to my friends.
140120841X|5.0|has changed many of my perspectives on life. Comic books are literature no matter what one may think, and Alan Moore is a genius.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|We only saw the 1st 45-min. Delivery was interrupted & we watched a line of dots march under the amazon logo for another 30-min before giving up:(
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|James Altucher's writing is truly a breath of fresh air. In a world full of people who claim to be experts at everything, trumpeting the strings of letters after their names, James is the type of person who will openly state that he is an expert at nothing. He is just a regular human being like you and me who speaks his truth honestly and from the heart. It just so happens that he has figured out a powerful way to overcome the type of major adversities that often keep people feeling like they're being water-boarded by life.<br /><br />Rather than becoming helpless victims of an unstable and rapidly evolving 21st century world, Choose Yourself gives us an alternative. It contains amazing insights into a simple and straightforward game plan that anyone can use to increase their quality of life many times over; in an easy to read and lighthearted format that actually made me laugh out loud a bunch of times. We have many more options and opportunities than we even realize. It covers everything from stories of how others have persevered against the odds, to how to find balance, to how to create ideas for multi-million dollar companies, and most importantly of all - how to use this knowledge to rediscover the light at the end of the tunnel when you've lost all hope of ever finding fulfillment.<br /><br />Any one of the dozens of ideas in Choose Yourself are easily worth 100x the price of the book.
B009AMANH4|5.0|This was a great movie. I loved every minute and it really didn't seem as long as it was. I recommend it for everyone!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved seeing the beautiful period dress and how that class lived during that time period.  The characters are are fascinating!
B0098VXN2Y|2.0|As expected, star studded very predictable story line with a few funny ha-ha moments. Entertaining if you have nothing else to do.
B009NY43NY|4.0|The whole serIes tied up with a ribbon? Will there be more,seems unlikely that we. Should see another Sookie book.
B003KLSK2Q|5.0|Love this cd, her music is always great and not always the same. Music for every mood.She doesn't have an album every year so always special.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love Mahjong like solitaire and jewels. It is a game you could play all day. When I start to play I do not want to stop I am trying to teach my grand children how to play.
B0012YYZYK|5.0|As a whole it's fantastic.  If you like Led Zeppelin, as most people reading this do, you will like this.<br /><br />I do have a gripe about it though:<br />It includes 4 songs that were not on the original release.  Those songs are:<br />Celebration Day<br />Misty Mountain Hop<br />Over The Hills and Far Away<br />The Ocean<br />My gripe is that they were not edited into the other concert footage.  They have to be accessed through an &#34;extras&#34; menu.<br />Perhaps I'm being too picky but that's how I feel.  If I feel ambitious I may make myself a custom version that is just the way I want it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Well, I started to read this after brief scans (didn't want to read reviews-TMI) of what a fabulous book this was.  I absolutely \\"HATED\\" Drew at first! I thought \\"I really don't like the premise that he was such a player/***hole\\", but as I read further into the dynamic with Katherine Brooks, the new hire/heroine, I felt vindicated! LOL!<br /><br />Yes, a comeuppance story! Who doesn't love that(well, with a whole lot of self-reflection on H/h's parts making it real!) It had everything! Fast-paced, hot sex, sarcastic banter, hot sex, great work ethics (Haha!), sexual tension, hot sex, good family & friend support, cute little children, (no, won't say it again after children!).  I found myself LOL a lot!<br /><br />Do men really think like this all the time? Perhaps so, they are \\"MEN!\\"  This is why we can laugh when they are seemingly confused about life/women in general (do I sound a bit sexist?) Oh well, can't apologize, we are who we are! JUST LIKE MEN!<br /><br />Thanks so much for such a great read Emma! Can't wait to see what you do next!  ;)
B009CF7GRY|3.0|entertaining but not super but hey it's footloose. I enjoyed it more than I thought but moved to dance? nope. not moved to buy either.
B00AWJYJVA|3.0|An amazing writer, and his books are absolutely awesome.  However for some reason, this one falls short.<br />Perhaps it's because compared to the tremendous level of corruption and atrocities committed all over the world today, I found the storyline a bit of an anti-climax.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|A friend told me about this movie and I decided to buy it. Glad I did. It's a great addition to the rest of the movies I have, including the corpse bride. Coraline was an interesting movie. A little different but well done. I would recommend this movie for the family you will all enjoy it. : )
B008Y7CZUY|5.0|I think this summer I will visit Italy just because of this movie. Completely amazing. I would Highly recommend this movie.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|In my opinion this one was the best of the Bourne series. Lot of action and interesting plot that will keep you glued to the screen. Highly recommended.
0061353248|5.0|No need to add to all the kudos this book has receive. Just trust the reviewers: the book is eye-opening, provocative, fun to read, and perhaps a bit ahead of its time. If only governments and people could be persuaded to follow his advice!
B00AHHODH2|5.0|Story-telling at its best!  I would have given it four stars until I learned this was part of a trilogy and the few questions I felt were unanswered would be answered later.  The story will keep you guessing until the very end!  Wonderfully written and fun throughout.  I've already read it twice just to pick up the little hints I may have missed the first time.  I can't wait to read more of Duncan's stories!
1400069807|5.0|How much control do you give others when it comes to your health?  Do you really know what is in your food?  Take your personal responsibility for your health to the next level.  Reading this book will give you the knowledge that the BIG food giants don't want you to know.  This book will rock your world and change how you look at  food the next time you are in the grocery store.
B000JQV68A|3.0|never read it. just downloaded it on my ipod a long time ago and i guess it counts it as a purchase.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Good fun and wonderful music.  It has become one of my favorites.  Great family entertainment.  It is set in one my favorite cities.
B000B589JI|5.0|This is a cool gadget because it holds one full refill for a zippo lighter. Would recommend getting it if you own a zippo lighter
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Best game yet lots of flying and shooting droids tons of different armour and stuff like that it's not to hard or to easy I'd say this was worth one dollar<br />By wolf
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The series doesn't need my stars for its high ratings.  It outshines everything on TV and most everyone knows it.
B0029LCJJS|1.0|If your into history you'll love this!!! ***** for all seasons!! It's a must see. Not for younger children!!! I love to see how people lived in the 1700's.
B008ROELL0|5.0|One of Michael Douglas' best performances. I loved it when it first came out and it still is one of my favorites.
B00AMS38YU|4.0|We had to restart this movie four (4) or more times to finish it. Other than that it was a great movie!
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|It is one of our favorite Dahl stories, and wonderfully rendered.  It is a favorite in my family we return to again and again.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is totally awsome. You logins yourself writhing as often as you can. Even on the bus. I even find myself jotting things down while I'm in church.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I never knew about the orphan trains, so found this very interesting. I felt it was well written and a good story overall. I would recommend.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|This is such an easy to follow method of losing weight, plus it has so many other benefits that I can't understand why everyone isn't on it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I probably would have given it 5 stars, but my expectations were so high from the &#34;Kite Runner&#34; and a &#34;Thousand Splendid Suns&#34;. I thought the book was well written and the story interesting. I just did not find the story as compelling as his last two. I felt in the other two books, it got much more in depth with the main characters, where in this one, you learn about numerous people who are interconnected. Personally, I like the other style better, but this was still a great book and would recommend it to anyone who asked.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Hidden object is great. I couldn't put it down. The plot is pretty interesting too.  I loved it and will recommend it to friends. Challenging
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This bible has many many versions.  You can download versions for offline reading. (Good for church where there is no Wi-Fi.<br />There are Bible studies.  Talking Bible.  Radio sermons.  Study plans.<br />And best of all this is an easy and fast set up.  Try it, you'll like it.<br />God has blest these programmers.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|This app is the best dj mixer app ever on the kindle fore i would recommend it to everyone. Awesome
B009PK9SB8|3.0|The camera was too small for my use. Never used the accesories. Sent them all back because of the camera.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|If you read this book as gender neutral it would be an instruction manual on how to be successful through a positive and energetic work ethic. I avoid the use of the word aggressive because that has become a trigger word for anti social behavior in our pc world. I run a business with 125 women and 4 men and I don't experience what Sandberg is talking about. I grew up with my Mother running the family business. When my ex-wife asked my Mother if she was going to join the march for women's equality her answer was &#34;I'll be damned if I'm going to give up my superiority to become equal&#34;. I found the book to be totally subjective and blind to the solid achievement of those people, men and women, who exhibit excellence in performance. Competence in the executive suite is recognized quickly by top managers so only work for a company that has top managers. Then there is no need for a book bemoaning the fate of women.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|I enjoyed reading this e-book, but you're probably wondering why I gave it four stars? Four stars is not bad. This is a very resourceful reference e-book. I read through it once and took down a few notes as to not forget anything. But I will do as Mr. Murphy suggested and read it a second and possibly a third time. You know, go through it with a fine tooth comb. Keep in mind, I am a shy person so it will take me some doing to put Mr. Murphy's plan into action. I have talked to a few strangers on the streets of Detroit, Michigan. They talk to me and 9 out of 10 times, I respond. Before, I probably never would have said anything. So, I have progressed. I know this review is short, but I have other things to accomplish. In conclusion, I recommend this e-book to people who have a hard time opening up in social situations. Just be yourself and take it slow.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|I've read the rest of the John Corey books, and I loved them. This one, however, was a big disappointment. It's like DeMille wanted to show off how much \\"inside info\\" he's gotten from his sources and how much he knows about Yemen. I'm looking for a dramatic suspenseful fiction, not a travel guide. Also, I've totally lost interest in John Corey. Both the character and his creator have gotten a little too cocky. Lame, cause the other books are awesome. Read the others. Just pretend The Panther doesn't exist.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing solitaire, I play at least an hour of solitaire a day.  Wish there was other ways of playing the game.
B009NY43NY|2.0|For those of us who have read the entire series, this is a complete disappointment. The plot is unbelievable (quick turnabout of affections, an accepting/passive Eric, etc.) and the characters are weak (especially Sookie who becomes less likable). Considering this was the end of the series, I expected much more of Harris. Truly disappointing.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It the Bible? It the word of God!  It is my weapon against all my enemies.  The gives meaning to our lives.  It's Jesus in written form!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The first three seasons were great; the fourth is even better. Hard to beat a series where the women are such strong characters, and where every character manages to be both well defined and somewhat mysterious. This cast can do no wrong.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game I love because it forces me to think.  I refuse to be beaten by it, so continue to work  until it is solved
B0097GVJWQ|2.0|Excellent until the last chapter, unable to finish due to a game glitch (when you have to tap the runes in order) apparently it's a Kindle thing since I have seen this reported by several other kindle users. Bummer because it was pretty cool until the end.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is a great movie and certainly deserved winning best picture.  It really helps you understand what is like to be caught in Iran in 1979 when the Revolution took place.  The movie is gripping, fun, and extremely well done.  Highly recommended.
B00B23O96A|3.0|Not sure what Eric was thinking on this one.  Like a trip down memory lane for him I suppose, but for me I just found it way boring.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|This works really well.  I use it mostly in airplanes as my wife and I split the audio signal on my notebook.  I can recommend this.
B00A8307BG|3.0|If you're looking for &#34;Rip the roof off&#34; rock and roll... keep looking.  Love Trower, but this is just a bunch of old blues standards.
B001NOQI3U|5.0|Barbra Streisand is my favorite actress and singer and this movie she directed is amazing and beautiful! I love everything about it.  especially the underlying love story!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|You like this game for the first 3 days then you never play it again. It gets boring very quickly. I would recommend not buying this game!!
B0072GPQ72|5.0|love it
1452658382|5.0|I really didn't know how or if Nalini Singh could make Kaleb a likeable lead though I did find him to be a fascinating character in previous books. She not only succeeded but this was one of the best books of her Phy-Changeling series. I would recommend it to anyone though to get the most out of Kaleb's story, you should read the whole series. It's well worth it, one of the best series out there in paranormal romance.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|i have this game on my kindle and i had 74 jems and about 30,000 coins and i went to play it and it restarted my game and made me really angry because i worked really hard to get all the upgrades to just have it all disapear like i never even did it.
B001NHNG64|3.0|The second Jack Reacher novel.  I thought the writing was better...very informative about certain weapons and ballistics, nice attention to timeline and details, but I could not attach myself emotionally to any of the characters.  5-2012

0440246318|5.0|I have not read this one yet...saving it for a while becasue I know I will \\"eat it up!\\" from page one!!  I have read everyone of his books and NEVER been disappointed.  I feel like I am saving candy waiting to crack the first page!!Lee Child's Jack reacher is every man's man and every woman's man!!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|If you're an Eagles fan, this is definitely worth buying.  Professionally done, very informative.  Bonus concert DVD from 70's concert very good too.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great acting, storytelling and scenery. I enjoy watching this so much. Highly entertaining, worth a look. So many twists and turns.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I like how fast you can rank up &amp; grow your dinos.<br />It's enjoyable and leisure.<br />When you have notifications turned on,it lets you know when dinos are hungry .
B009NY43NY|3.0|The book had humorous moments. Sookie ended up with the who I predicted and the person that was logical. The book lacked character development.
B00886XQO0|5.0|Easy setup. I recently found myself enjoying BTing my phone and playing my own personalized gaming soundtrack. Now i know this could have been on several other ways it seemed right with the Tango Ones. Phone calls are now integrated with  push of  button no need to pause or remove headset. This is a completely wireless headset w/chat option for the Xbox 360
B005FHXB0O|5.0|A roller coaster ride from the very beginning!! I loved this movie! Big stars, excellent roles. WOW! I held my breathe every five minutes.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I am sure you will enjoy listening to the music from the piano guys, it is unique and simply refreshing. You can try but going to youtube first and I am sure you will attracted to them.
B000JCQCW4|4.0|This tale of four people (mother, son, girlfriend and friend) who descend down various paths of drug abuse and dependency is a powerfully told story that really captures the depths of despair in the transition of these peoples' lives.  Fantastic acting particularly Ellen Burstyn, makes this film totally believable.  Not a feel good movie by any means so don't go if you're looking for that.  But if you like or don't mind a depressing tale well-told with a bit of moral soul-searching then this movie is for you.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Great movie.  One you'll want to watch more than once.  Purchased it for my husband but I also enjoy it.
B009NY43NY|5.0|loved it! the end of the end was a little strange, but it was all good. Didn't expect to see some of the characters who were at the end, but good nonetheless.
B0002TT36G|5.0|It is a very good album for cards (standard size), as heroes, sports and others cards. Good quality and good size, not too big, not too small, beautiful design.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Basically, this is Degradation Trip Volume 3, and it is superb. (If you like TDPDH and don't have Degradation Trip, by all means get it. It was released twice. Get the later one that is Volumes 1 & 2, with more songs.) I liked every single song on TDPDH on first hearing and feel like I've received some kind of wondrous gift.
B005J4TLN4|4.0|Not a movie you would watch with the kids around. It was funny to watch with my friends. It going to make you laugh.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|I love the characters.  It's so nice to have new races and difficulties to encounter.  I think this is my favorite Star Trek series.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Fun and addictive.  Great game to pass the time while waiting at appointements.  i would recommend this game for puzzle lovers.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|I loved this movie. Marcus' (Friend) lines were awesome could not stop laughing. This was just an all around funny movie.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|What can I say. I have all the movies, DVD and Blu Ray and all the books. I am a HP nut.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|More teenage angst than I care for, but holy mackerel, the final battle scene (worthy of \\"X Men\\") made up for it
B003NS4TEY|5.0|Loved this episode since (unless you have watched Doctor Who) we are finally, really meeting Captain Jack.  I would have been really pissed if they hadn't kissed!!! A small amount of satisfaction, but worth the wait.
B008JFUO0Y|3.0|I am an absolute fan of this film and saw it 4 times in theaters. However, I am highly disappointed in the fact that some idiot out there decided to burn all Evil Dead fans by NOT giving them the completely full uncut NC-17 version of this film. Thanks for showing you really care about your fans, *ssholes. I refuse to purchase this film, though I loved it dearly simply for that reason. I don't appreciate getting screwed as a fan, as I'm sure most people who had their hopes up would agree. Thanks, but no thanks. 3 stars because it was a great reboot, but an epic failure of a release.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I super enjoyed this movie....it was everything that they said it was. I would watch it again. If you don't watch this you would really be missing out on a fantastic movie.
B00CRR5YA0|4.0|Good feeling invoking music from the movie. A good sci-fi soundtrack for mood setting and thought-provoking experience to go by.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|It is a really good movie and my daughter and I enjoyed watching it. My daughter said that she would watch it again.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|great movie, kids love it. Great quality using cable internet. Amazon UI still needs updated compared to Vudu and Netflix.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This is a great movie for any fans of action movies, super hero, or fans of these actors.  I recommend seeing the movie.
B0058SNKRY|2.0|I was hoping to find a pair of comfortable slip-ons for the summer.  I ordered these because I thought they looked cute and not like the typical Crocs.  My foot is wide, and even the wide shoe is a bit snug.  But that's not the problem.  The problem is that with each step, air gets pushed out from beneath my foot causing a very embarrassing sound to occur.  Let's just say that I have gotten enough strange looks from people that I have stopped wearing the shoes completely.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I get the unhelpful error message, \\"There was an error processing your request\\" when I try to log in. The app is unusable.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Could have been shorten and keep practically the same information. Not much said about his attitudes toward thé aspects other than products (finance, HR)
B009NY43NY|5.0|Loved it, but it was a bitter-sweet read as you because you know it is the last book in the Sookie Stackhouse series.  It ties up some loose ends but not too tidily as to seem trite.  There was a surprise at the end for me.  Hope you enjoy it!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Very interesting, the author was very honest about Shin and writing the book with him but it was most of all eye opening to what is happening in North Korea.  I would totally recommend this to someone
B00992CF6W|3.0|Survivalcraft is cheeper (3.99). It has better graffics. It has easier controlls. But if you want the original get minecraft-pocket edition. I have gotten both and I enjoy survivalcraft more.I hope this helps. : )
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I read this for a book club and I would say that the majority of the people enjoyed it.  It kept you guessing as to what was going to happen that is for sure.  I didn't LOVE the characters though.  It was okay but I was able to put it down
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Is a challenging game;  yet is easy to play.  I am determined to get past level one.  I flip on the last hill.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love Minecraft it is so cool. Mojang went all out best game ever!!!!!!! Get it get it get it need to buy
B00COMLLX2|5.0|I'm almost a senior citizen & I downloaded this app so I can be a kid every once in a while. It works really well. I cant believe the great animation. This app was free & well worth it.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Loved every book of Coben. This was no exception. Thrilling, suspenseful, funny and filled with surprises to the last page.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I thought this game was highly entertaining in terms of concept and ease of play.<br /><br />Graphics are terrible, but I'm fairly certain this is done on purpose and to me added to the shtick which made the game appealing.<br /><br />The only drawback for me was that it didn't last long enough - I reached the end in about a week playing an hour or so a day.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Just got it today, graphics are good, and easy to play. Considering buying the full version. Love figuring out puzzles, and HO part is good also. I think it is a well thought out game and so far story line is interesting. I recommend it if this is your type of game you enjoy playing.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|I ordered a Kingle Fire to replace my original Kindle.  It's a great tablet.  I defineately needed a cover for it as I had scratched my old one.  This came just as expected.  My Kindle slipped right in and is protected now when the cat decides he has to walk on it!  The red isn't quite as vibrant as in the picture but it's still a nice color.  I can wrap my earbuds around the case and that way I don't lose them!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. This book leaves you with wanting to read the next book in the series. The characters are great. Hope you enjoy!
1591840562|4.0|Kawasaki's point is that the hardest part of undertaking a project is simply TO GET STARTED.<br />As Nike ads say, JUST DO IT.
B00CRS5HII|5.0|The guy has a golden voice and excellent mind for music. This shows in any music connected to this artist. Always a hit.
B004B8DH98|4.0|George Clooney's acting is wonderful (as usual).  I like him.  The film seems somber yet interesting.  I feel sorry for his character who chooses the wrong path in life.  I think the film is worth the cost.  See more at vyctoryab dot wix dot com slash xplr.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is awesome and I think it is fun for me and I am only 11. I recommend you this too you
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I originally downloaded the app just to try it out, but it's so fun it's hard to put down. Game progression is easy, slow at times because of the cost of items for missions, but still fun. The underwater park is neat too. Good game for people that like tycoon style games.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this app!!! People who complain on how there's only 6 people to choose from, so what? If u had an imagination, it wouldn't be a problem
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app helps me get up for school without I would be late who ever made this is very smart and complex as well
1742200508|2.0|Pros: Covers a lot of areas. Type is easy to read.<br /><br />Cons: Only about 20 photos, despite the hefty 800+ pages. Although we associate \\"Lonely Planet\\" with \\"Budget Travel,\\" a *lot* of the sections give listings for chi-chi shops, Michelin-star restaurants, and boutique hotels. They had several writers working on this, and it feels like those writers did not have their priorities in line.<br /><br />I would also advise you to double-check anything that sounds appealing with another source. For instance, they devote an entire sidebar to Maiden Castle (p. 276). My in-laws live next door. It's a nice place to walk the dog, but basically, it's a grassy hill with a Roman history that you wouldn't guess if they didn't tell you. In contrast, there are only two paragraphs (and not as a sidebar) devoted to Tintagel in Cornwall, which is absolutely breathtaking. There is no mention of Merlin's Cave there, which is truly magical. You are not going to gain a strong sense of where to spend your time from this book alone.<br /><br />I'm taking off another star because despite the sidebar, Maiden Castle isn't even in the index. Again, it's fun to read, but we wish they had made this a more useable book.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really enjoyed the game, just wasn't long enough! Liked that there was other puzzles interspersed through out the game. Enjoy!
B00C1XZ2LQ|4.0|This recording stands on its own two feet: it's enjoyable to listen to apart from the movie, though some of the themes are a little over-dramatized.  Still, it's worth purchase, even though the movie itself is sort of &#34;Oblivious&#34;. I'd like to hear more from Anthony Gonzalez and Joseph Trapanese, who produced the music.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game is so cool you can put make up on them and jewelry you can dress them that's why this game is so great
B009O2XY12|3.0|At first I was skeptical but it's not bad.  The higher the level the more complicated the moves - and some of the moves are impossible.  I'm not crazy about that aspect but still the game is entertaining.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|How the hell do I download it!  Its says I own it and still cant play the game that I own
B0084B5TK8|3.0|I wouldn't read this book otherwise if it wasn't a choice of our 10-person discussion group on the theme of the year 1900 (a bit before and a bit after 1900). The others in the group are reading it in a German translation. I'm the only foreigner and prefer my native language. Natch.<br />I expect it to be ok but not really a good read. Vampires are not my thing. But if vampires, then the original one.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It is really awesome everyone who uhh of play it right now go download it right now the best game ever ok invented on amazon
B006BQM762|4.0|Really interesting in the beginning and had great tip of the hat to Spielberg blockbusters of old. It got a little sappy at the end but definitely enjoyable.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This book was amazing! It absolutely desperate a five star rating! Good job Frances Hodgson Burnett! You're a great author!
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Deeply moving.  Completely interesting.  So insightful and fascinating.  Gives you a deep look inside North Korea.  Thank God there are some people who get away and are able to tell their stories.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This great app is very easy to understand and use. I am very pleased with it. Thanks for providing it.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|I've been a fan of John Wayne movies since I first watched The Cowboys when I was younger. There is always a palpable feeling of understanding associated with his films and the characters he played, of getting a glimpse of the inner workings of history, humanity, and/or yourself. Though it is one of his more comedic undertakings, McLintock! is no exception. This version is the best I've seen, and no wonder considering it includes trademarking from both Paramount and Batjac Productions (Wayne's producing company). With a great collection of extras also included, this is definitely the version to get!
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|We have quite a few movies by Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli in our family and have never been disappointed. This is probably most akin to My Neighbor Totoro in that the emphasis is as much on the fantasy as the message (although the environmental/pollution moral is certainly no secret). It is not as dark as some of Miyazaki's movies and is great for kids and adults. My two boys (4 and 6) watched this over and over on Netflix, so when it went off streaming we had to buy it. The quality of the video and sound are good, and it includes original Japanese and English audio and subtitles.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My son plays the games on my kindle I mostly read. He seems to love this game. So if you have a 10 year old boy I would get it.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|I enjoyed it, but I wanted to know what was up with David and Queenie sooner! It wasn't until 86% in that I found out! And what about Maureen's secret? Is she never going to tell Harold what happened between her and Queenie?
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is so addicting!  There are a lot of challenges, places to go and fish to eat.  It's really cool how you graduate from shark to shark.  This one is hard to put down!!
B008BU75IQ|1.0|I loved the first two books in this trilogy and looked forward to this third one. What a let down - I almost quit in the middle. There is no real plot - it seems his publisher told him he had to write a third book, but he was out of ideas. He should have stopped after the second Clifton Chronical book!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I liked the first Temple Run and this is a good follow-up. Although you run an jump like the first one I like the characters and the new things to run and jump over.  The trip through the mine shaft is really a great addition!!
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Really enjoy Fleetwood Mac with Stevie Nicks.<br /><br />This is a great addition to my collection.<br /><br />I recommend this album to all Fleetwood Mac fans.
B00AECGQF2|3.0|The kids picked and played it.  They like it, I find the noises that the characters make are really creepy.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This app rooks the first minute I got the app at my grandma's I loved it I have<br />Only had this app for about ten minutes and I was so into this app
B00BU18U82|5.0|My grandsons help with the farm at home and are very familiar with the equipment and how it operates for real, so they really like it and I think their Dad likes it a lot too.
B0083Z614S|5.0|The descriptions of gardens in this book are detailed and absorbing.  Uplifting story too, which makes for nice calm reading before bedtime.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was just flat out hilarious!!! It had me laughing from beginning to end. Really enjoyed that this story contained comedy as well as steaminess!! The hero was over confident but in a good way that made his story very interesting. I would like to read more by this author!!
B009G78EE2|4.0|this cd not only has good messaging- but a decent beat throughout the album. Its great to listen to in the car. I think maclemore and ryan did a fantastic job.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|If I hadn't been with my wife I would have quit after first 20-30 minutes.  She said let's see where this is going.  Glad we did!
B00C5ZORES|3.0|it definitely has a good beat and feeling to the whole album.... but doesn't fully feel like fall out boy.
B004132HZS|5.0|I am so grateful I chose to buy this! It has made it easier to watch the TV show and to share it with my family and friends. The older pilot episode (the 60 minute one) is also a plus because it shows you a whole different way and faster way to solving the first case. Highly recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love subway surfers because it is a game that brings you around the world and kids get to have fun and see what alot of countrys they never even herd of like sydney subway surfers is awesome
B003G4W49C|2.0|People should be warned that this is not serious science fiction and that the material is just this side of religous and political propaganda. The author is a Mormon and his church's views are insinuated in a rather sneaky way into the narrative. Consequently, I would not recommend this book even as juvenile fiction.
B00C6F60HE|1.0|Why are there two different versions of this on Blu-Ray on Amazon, and what is the difference?<br /><br />(Not counting the weird \\"bilingual\\" one in English/Esperanto.)<br /><br />Here is one, already released - ASIN: B000HEVZ6W<br /><br />New one, not out yet - ASIN: B00C6F60HE<br /><br />Also, both Blu-Ray disks say they are in NTSC format.  I thought we left that behind when we transitioned to High Definition.  Shouldn't they both say 1080p or something similar?<br /><br />(The movie is great.  I am giving the product shown here on amazon one star (because I can't give it zero) for the lack of information and general crapitude of presentation.)
B00B671W6W|5.0|It's Awesome that Anthrax covered these Killer Tunes!  Glad the 'Ol Guys are still around... blast from the past! Cool.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Very enjoyable CD!  Bruno Mars has done it again. I really enjoy his music and look forward to future CD's from him.
030759565X|5.0|If you like Smitten Kitchen, then of course you'll love this. It's a book form of all that's wonderful about her blog, but it doesn't just feel like a blog on paper. She's done a great job of adapting her material for the medium while still providing the humor and excellent cookery that you know and love. To that end, it's not just a re-do of recipes that you can already get online, as she's deliberately picked and tested a book-specific set. I've showed this to my mom, and it's finally what's gotten to start reading the blog! And, oh yeah, literally any recipe I've used has been excellent. Overall - a must buy.
B007SXB498|5.0|Jane Austen's books all are my favourite.  Her words can make the readers (I mean myself) feel what the character's are feeling.  Worth spending time to read and re-read.
0385341679|5.0|This is most likely the best fantasy paranormal series I will ever read, certainlly the best I've read so far.  I'm sure I would have slowly gone insane waiting for Shadowfever to be published after the mysterious (not really) cliffhanger in Dreamfever.  Thank the gods I did not discover the series until after all the books had been published.  Needless to say the ending book to the series - Shadowfever - turned out to be far beyond my expectations.  Ms. Moning is a master storyteller who thoroughly researches the factual parts of her stories and brings her characters fully to life. The stories themselves are woven from some mystical place only she knows. May she continue to weave these tales until I am no longer around to read.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Awsome could have been a better vehicle. But fun and gets boring after about this year over the palace hip hop in love with the day
B005TBN04S|4.0|these guys are hilarious when they do unexpected things... which they do often. first and second ones are both great.. can't wait to see number III.
B005GG0MIS|3.0|I find that the book is too long, with many unnecessary details. If it were edited and shortened somewhat it would be a better read.
B004132I20|1.0|I cannot return as I didn't try to watch it (having seen it already) until just recently--way past the 90 day return policy. I ordered the US version Blu-Ray. Never had this happen before with Amazon until now. Very irate. I ordered both season 1 and 2 at the same time and apparently they decided to send the British versions of both! Now I'm out money all because I didn't watch them. Well, I was deployed and didn't have my Blu-Ray player but since I've seen them before I didn't think anything of it. I've always bought from Amazon--may have to think twice now. Products are not being advertised for what they are.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|this movie is much better than the other trillogy. I can not wait for the next 2 episodes to come out
B000R4SMCW|5.0|Superb acting, amazing plot and great script. You can't ask for much more, and you wouldn't expect any less from the two leads. If you liked the silence of the lambs, you will love this too.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Great book.i found myself laughing so much my husband wanted to hear what I was reading. I really enjoyed the writing style. I would love to get this as an audio book if it came out,just because I enjoyed  it so much.
0375714669|1.0|Had to read this for a class. It was really boring, really depressing and pretty predictable. Here's the story: troubled girl tries to make it through life and gets into a lot of minor bad situations. Drugs, alcohol, sex, depression, anxiety, we've all seen it before. It tries to make an emotional impression, but it's entirely forgettable. If you're looking for a decent emotional graphic novel, try Maus.
B005PK56TA|4.0|good solid writing and acting, the episodes kept me wanting more , so, good job to the production team and actors.
B002N7P23I|5.0|Movies don't usually scare me. This one did. Most horror movies are pretty predictable and there's some jump scares, but in the end you're not really scared. This one is different, this one will keep you up.
B0000024YL|5.0|We are all happy when our mother, both biologic and Mother Earth, feel our relief.<br />I'm a little concerned  about my business with a non-civilly supportive business. It takes financial effort from everyone to maintain social/civil order.
B009NY43NY|5.0|So sad to see it end.  Sookie is such a great character.  She is definitely unforgettable. Great book as always for the Stackhouse novels.
B001JIA5TS|5.0|There's something about the chemistry between Redford and Pitt that becomes pure enhancement when they work together. This was brilliant, vintage Tony Scott. Sad that he's gone. The myriad of supporting actors dazzle. Scenes that take place at the CIA and that was much of the movie, looked convincingly spot on. I liked it even more having been an expatriate that had lived in Hong Kong. I have no personal measure but I thought the scenes shot of the Middle East, violently startling as they were, appeared to be frighteningly and brutally authentic. I'd read a lot of Bob Baer's exploits in and out of the Middle East. From what I could tell, scenes in the movie accurately reflected the scope and scale regarding much of the ever present nastiness there.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|It's just a great experience to realize you're in the hands of a writer who cares about his material, characters and plot, who did his research, and who knows how to build a thesis and get it across dramatically.  Also, pretty horrifying in parts...but that's all part of the ride.
B0039HR5QS|3.0|Not bad in general. Entertaining because of the actors involved. Von Sydow gives a chilling performance with his amoral approach to life in general. Every time Cliff Robertson is on screen you want to burst out laughing. He was wearing the worst rug of all time that ever appeared in a film. Entertaining, particularly given the technology of the time.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|This season deliverers as expected, Doctor Who is always a great show to watch, though if you haven't watched the first seasons you should before jumping in here.
B00AY0A71I|5.0|Jamie Lee was a Babe!!!!<br /><br />Crazy Cast, wish they had done a sequel<br /><br />Yep I loved it, YEA Baby<br />d
B003DZX3SA|5.0|We love this movie.  My granddaughter and I watch it over and over.  Great price, priceless memories.  Don't miss this
B001I8A76A|5.0|Funhouse is my favorite song! She never let's me down.funhouse , family portrait, and Just like a pill. All from other albums of course.
B00009Z574|3.0|‘Tormato’ was by general consent the weakest album from Yes in the 1970s, part-redeemed by a few OK songs. It’s a lighter, more pop-oriented offering containing the kind of short 5-minute numbers revived in the mid-70s by the ‘new wave’ movement as a rebellion against the excesses of the ‘progressive rock’ era, and looked like an attempt by the band to distance itself from the legacy of musically complex & imaginative epics like ‘Tales’ and attract a new audience.<br /><br />The line-up is that of ‘Tales’ and ‘Going for the One’: Anderson, Howe, Squire, Wakeman and White so you know what these guys can do, which makes the result on ‘Tormato’ all the more disappointing. Although the musicianship (as usual with this band) and production are exemplary, compositionally ‘Tormato’ doesn’t reach the heights of any of the band’s previous six albums. It’s unmistakably the ‘Yes sound’ but mostly forgettable though a few good tunes like ‘Don’t kill the Whale’ and ‘On the silent Wings of Freedom’ do shine – but not too brightly.<br /><br />Well all things must move on, and the relatively disappointing ‘Tormato’ led to the opening of a new chapter in the Yes story. Jon Anderson quit the band for a few years to pursue solo work with Vangelis (leaving Chris Squire as the only surviving founder member), and Rick Wakeman left for the second time. ‘Tormato’ marked the close of the great creative 1970s era for Yes, and from this time on the band – which became a kind of venerable music-industry brand with a particular recognisable sound – entered a new dynamic, characterised by a collegiate caucas of musicians who came and went, performed the old favourites and occasionally composed some good original music.<br /><br />The follow-up album carrying the Yes name was ‘Drama’ which, even with Anderson and Howe absent, was better than ‘Tormato.’
B00BMVTS1S|4.0|I loved it..i wish I can download this version though, I can only stream it. Other then that, the movie is great<br /> Mid way through it messes u for about 10 seconds. everything goes blury and audio drops. after a few seconds, it fixes its self
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series leaves you wanting more. They have great character development! This book had me hooked and on the edge of my seat.
B00B7ERH04|4.0|I ran out of camcoins! I was sad and I got it lime 20 minutes before! Please fix this so we don't run out of the camcoins. I do not want to bye the pro I like this one. Does this appear to be a problem  others or is it just me?
B00B2166BS|4.0|This was highly recommend to me by my finance who is a tech guru. He was so excited about it. He's the one who got me the Samsung Nexus 10(which I love).  The Pogo cable is okay. Not as great as I thought it was going to be. I really thought the charge was going to be a lot quicker, but I guess we can't have it all:-)
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Great for first time buyers. Fast uploads, clear descriptions of items. Friendly and helpful sellers. So easy you're blind Grandmother can use it!
B005ZMUXDC|4.0|Tangled is not only my daughters favorite movie, it is mine too. It is a cute coming of age story for anyone and also keeps it interesting enough for adults to be entertained.
B00A2AU0KI|3.0|I was expecting a complicated movie with some depth but instead this is a fairly predictable, very \\"Holywoodish\\" kind of movie. Cast is good and this is basically what saves the movie. I would recommend this as a light movie that can help pass some time but this is definitely missing some depth, and maybe a more realistic ending (no details here - i don't want to spoil).
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Next generation of gaming. Very impressive to see this quality of game play on a app game. I enjoyed that you can have more then one character and try the different classes. Characters and gear look very cool. Bosses were intriguing and challenging. Making the game more rewarding and fun. Mobs respawn including elite mobs if you want to go back and grind some good loot or extra exp before moving on to the next area. Overall 5 stars look forward to seeing more games of this quality on the kindle.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Dead Ever After was fantastic. Charlaine Harris never disappoints! My only regret is that there will be no more Sookie Stackhouse novels I have actually come to know and love these characters. If you ever change your mind Ms. Harris I will be the first one to pick up the book.
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|You can enjoy the album the whole way through. They sure rock. Thank you for putting this album out there!
0439023513|5.0|My granddaughter is reading this book and she has read other Collins' books and she informed me she is enjoying them.  She is going into the seventh grade and she is a reader.
B0089PWU2E|5.0|Great compilation with very good sound.. Nice overall quality with very good price!<br />Four cds with vinyl aspect, very nice!<br />I´ll buy more of other artist.<br />Brazil
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|.This game is epic, the name fits it perfectly and I can't wait to see the movie, and I'm sure, it will be epic.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Lady Antebellum continues to produce some of the best music. Their albums just keep getting better and better. If your a fan this is a must buy.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have to say that Im not a reader but I was hooked and finished all books in record time...
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A definite departure from the zombie survival guide, this non-linear story of humanity's final war against the undead is chilling and intelligent in its thoughtfulness and social commentary.  I was very impressed with the consistent touches of &#34;real world&#34; reactions, ie: how governments, people, etc would react in the face of an actual out break that threatened to consume all of humanity.  I thought it was well told, with a wide variety of character viewpoints, giving a truly epic feel to the events.  Highly recommended for those who want a zombie story that is groundbreaking and original.
B002QEXT4W|4.0|BUYER BEWARE! Here Amazon (or somebody) is advertising a \\"Salvo-d\\" copy of this, my third favorite Procol Harum album (\\"Shine On Brightly\\" and \\"Grand Hotel\\" the first two) by tempting one with Procol's ethereal version of \\"Blue Danube.\\"  Nope...just a \\"D-flat\\" version of about my least favorite PH song, the ever-so politically correct \\"As Strong As Sampson.\\"  That, and \\"Drunk Again,\\" which I imagine you already had on your current copy of the CD.  Still...the sound is magnificent, and hearing the feedback-squeech, Mick Grabham asking, \\"Is it on, Tommy?,\\" then \\"Nothing But The Truth\\" - it still, 29 years later, is a blast of sonic amyl-nitrate.  One great thing about the liner notes, though: for \\"Exotic,\\" etc, \\"Salvo\\" - THANK YOU!!! - didn't trot out H Scott-Irvine, the \\"Procol scholar\\" who has recently written a \\"National Inquirer\\" Procol Harum \\"biography,\\" author of several other Procol liner notes, a gent who must have an aching arm from patting himself on the back...
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Game is fun. Just don't like all the glitches. I was on level 29 and just figured out how to add friends when game messed up. Gameloft sent me an email expressing how sorry they were and not to restart. I waited a week for them to fix problem and it wasn't so I had to restart the game. I just wish you also had more energy.
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|THIS MOVIE IS NOT A REMAKE, RE-ENVISIONING, PREQUEL OR SEQUEL!!<br /><br />There was an interview with Raimi stating this is a PARALLEL STORY to the original, NOT a prequel, sequel, re-invisioning or remake, and that it will actually be a bridge to the next two Evil Dead films that he is currently working on. So -- if you read this and watch the movie as a remake, you're an idiot. If you read this and watch it know it's part of the official cannon, you will appreciate it more.<br /><br />This is a great horror movie. However, it certainly doesn't live up to the hype in regards to the gore. People that think this is \\"oh so gory!\\", clearly don't have much experience with this genre. Lots of cut aways, and what gore they do show, is nothing that hasn't been done a million times over (limbs getting cut off, tongues cut, etc). If you are a gore hound, this movie doesn't deliver like you would expect. This isn't to say it's not gory, and that the effects aren't good (they are excellent), it's just disappointing. It's not even that over-the-top like you would expect from the series.<br /><br />Anyway, as a movie, it delivers the goods just fine. It delivers the goods, but you will never fully win over the 'cult'. I'm not one of those cult-followers of the series, but I do think it is a honorable entry in the series.<br /><br />Either way... horror fans won't be let down, over all.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Good book of you like the Greek God's, if not this book is not for you. Rick Riordan is a wonderful author, I have enjoy the whole Percy Jackson series
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Overall ok the game is a little short in my opinion hidden object scenes require a little sleuthing which is good
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|This product is simply awesome.  It's perfect for playing VNs remotely since they are almost nonexistent on mobile devices.  I was not expecting the fee to use this outside of my home network but at $15 for a year of service it's not bad at all.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|My wife and i really enjoyed this move. lots of action and a not too complicated story line. Live long and prosper!!
B0057DCLMK|2.0|This book is not for beginners. The instructions are very vague and hard to follow. You have to just look at the photo and guess what you are supposed to do.
B007SGM084|3.0|Ok, I bought this set when everyone was all hyped up about it, the reviews were outstanding and that's all anyone was talking about, so I thought \\"Must be a great book, I'll get it to read\\". What a disappointment, that's all I can say about it.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong, this is a great set of books, but I don't see what all the excitement was about. For a sexy storyline that is supposed to be about hot and steamy sex it's not, I have read better Harlequin Romances with better sex scenes, and I thought those were trash.  It is a good love story about a naive college girl who has no clue about sex and a messed up billionaire that sweeps her off her feet. She has no clue about men and he has no clue how to relate to a woman. They learn life is not what they thought it was and try to build a relationship on that.<br /><br />Like I said, it's a good book, you definitely need to read all three stories, but it is NOT a set of books to get all hot and bothered about.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is fun and all but it won't update to 0.6.2 I've been waiting for it for about 3 months ): still hasn't updated

B005NKGEP2|5.0|This was like being in Europe without leaving home. Hope the next one is longer as the ending came up quickly.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised.  I found this book to be quite entertaining, I couldn't it down!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Honestly I thought a show about a bunch of stuffy English royals and their servants would be such a bore.  But I was rapidly converted -- you can't help but get engaged.  It moves along at a good pace, with many surprises.  Each of the many characters has his/her own plot line.  The sets, the costumes, and the great acting really take you back 100 years.  It's my new favorite show.
1439153663|5.0|This was a selection for a book discussion group.  Set in 1810 on a tobacco plantation in Virginia, it deals with the black slaves working the plantation and the white family living in the big house.  The isolation of the white family made it hard for a sharing of ideas or closeness with other affluent families.  On the other hand, the blacks living on the plantation were close knit families.  The author presents a picture of white women who were not prepared for the life they married into and dependent on  slaves but always maintaining an air of superiority.<br />This is a story that shows the dangers of being a slave under the control of the Master.  This is a story of the dangers of the casual use of drugs in coping with hardships of everyday life for the white women.
