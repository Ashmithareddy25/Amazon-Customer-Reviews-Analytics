B00G4CQNCC|5|Super cozy and soft and warm in the winter. love it!
B001ANIATE|5|I was impressed by the quality of the material. Light weight fabric which is very comfortable for me. I wear that through the summer season and it's so comfortable that I sometimes forget I'm wearing a high suit.
B00IE8W5F8|5|Great little boardshorts for the 4th of July! I was a little disturbed that it only has one pocket on the right side leg, but being boardshorts that was more or less expected. I have an awkward sort of body type as I have lost a lot of weight but still have a big butt, so I ordered them as a large, but I think I can now squeeze into a medium, so that was an error on my part.<br /><br />Otherwise they fit quite well and look really good, as part of my whole 4th of July get up - these were flawless in every sense!
B00LIUCMPW|5|Love them. Great price.
B00076ZRE6|5|great product  wears wsell  happy with shirts
B00774E4ZE|3|flowers are a little bigger than I wanted but it still is a great piece and look.
B001GBE52Q|5|Needed a nude leotard. Fits like all capezio, match the size with other styles.
B000GF4HS0|5|Very comfortable socks.  Go on and off easy.  I like Calvin Klein socks generally.  Try these.  I think you will be happy with them.
B00N597W8Q|4|Nice wallet
B00H7XC17I|5|the pajamas are beautiful.<br />the fit is great.<br />thanks a lot for this
B00156A65M|5|Pretty cool stuff! Diggin it man
B00B5MLEKC|5|I received so many compliments when I wore this dress! The green is very pretty! I had the sleeves shortened since I'm in a warm climate, but it still looks great!!
B009RPQG9S|4|Design and graphics are excellent.  Previous money clip was magnetic which I loved, but would not hold items securely and demagnetized credit cards.
B0087115JO|4|As with other Asian brands, I always expect the worst in terms of 1-size and 2-quality.<br />Surprisingly this shirt fits right, 63% cotton and the rest is polyester and spandex (this two are the \\"wrinkle free\\" products). The fitting is slim, I guess mostly for lean/toned guys. Probably most big guys will look ridiculous in this shirts (like putting a Barbie's blouse on a Mr. T doll!).<br />Anyway, it's a great shirt to go out at night, bars or clubs. I got mine in white and now I order one in dark green. Ususally I wear size S in the US, so I order a size M. Now, remember this is a slim fit shirt and like most Asian brands they are made for lean guys, so keep that in mind.
B00JBAT1PU|5|Love them -- they are very comfy!
B00LBT6WBA|5|Cool design and great quality! My son loved it and I want to steal it from him :)
B00D11W8X2|5|Nice quality fits excellent very snug and warm, no complaints here. Can't beat the price. It's warm warm warm warm!
B0009S6TNU|3|The mask was small for an adult
B006DZ7I6K|5|I really loved the wig.... Except for one thing. The pigtails were too heavy. They kept falling out and never stayed in place. I was dissapointed about that. But it came in great condition.
B00CE91CGQ|5|Important to know that this hoodie has nothing to do with Skylanders.  It is a Lego Chima hoodie.  My son is OBSESSED with Lego Chima and has been in Chi heaven since he got this hoodie.<br /><br />The hoodie seems standard quality...  not too thin of material.  The face part of the hoodie has velcro on the sides, so I thought the face would detach if desired... but not the case.  The face is sewed to the top of the hoodie and does not detach.  This is not a big deal, the velcro just doesn't make sense though since it doesn't detach.
B005S163OS|3|I get that its supposed to be a stage light or whatever but it looks pretty out of place on the all black background of the shirt. When i first looked at it i thought it was a bleach stain. Would like the shirt 100x more if not for the blue dot. Also i got the small and the arm holes are huge and stiff which will hopefully get better after a couple washes. Ordered another shirt that was printed on a bay island shirt as opposed to fruit of the loom like this one and it has a much nicer fit. Does anyone know if all the shirts from Rockabilia are printed on fruit of the loom?
B0088VTRLG|4|ugh  the dress  is super nice - but It runs too small- I gave the dress to my lil sister.
B003K9DMA8|5|I got this shirt as a birthday present for a family member. They absolutely loved it when they opened it!
B002MGB5CC|5|soft, light fabric, already washed and dried nicely, retained shape, (I wouldn't p ut them in the dryer tho)
B00K9E9MBK|4|I love this wrap! I only wish the strings wouldn't detach as often.
B0091V9DR0|5|Very funny shirt at parties. Fits well. Neck is a little tight but not uncomfortable. Recommended to anyone who enjoys weird shirts.
B00TPRIO7K|5|This dress is perfect love the way it fits me not to long just right . Wanted something to travel in and this will work nicely. I recommend this dress
B009UPTYCG|2|The material is soft to feel but when wearing it is scratchy.  I thought the ration of cotton to pollester would be more comfortable.  I had to remove the lace collar insert because it was very scratchy.<br />Then somewhat my fault I ordered the medium and it is way too big.  I have other gowns that are small and medium.
B009J7AGPO|4|buen producto
B001LLIFLS|4|Fit as expected plenty of room upfront for your package. Im a 34-36 wasit and the large fit prefect for me.
B00JN58OH4|5|It's really nice and I like it!
B005OFLSUM|5|Perfect.  They are thick, last a long time and I didn't have to go shopping for them.
B002SXKCTQ|5|I loved these shoes! Great quality and they fit perfectly! I have skinny legs, and its hard to find knee-high shoes that are huge around the calves, but these fit so nicely!
B008FPZZRA|3|I love the fabric, I bought a lot of shorts size M so I decided to buy this on the same size too, but it doesn't fit!! and It's a shame because the short is gorgeous!!!
B001QUW89Y|5|Good fit and quality.
B00DIV2T0C|2|The material is good and soft, but length is too short and the fit feels awkward.
B00MBPT4HW|5|I always have cold feet when I go to my yoga class, but these socks fixed my problem! They don't slip, I barely know they are there, and my feet stay warm! Great investment.
B00ARY91F4|5|FIT PERFECT FOR MY CHILDREN I HAVE THREE CHILDREN BUT I BOUGHT THESE FOR THE TWO GIRLS AND ONE IS 8 AND ONE IS 5 THEY WERE EVEN SMALLER WHEN I BOUGHT THEM AND THEY FIT EITHER CHILD . GREAT WITH COLORED UNIFORMS OR JUST GOING OUT!MUST BUY!
B004VQE2E4|4|This is a lovely bra, but the cups are too small - and I bought some other Natori bras with this bra as well, and they all have cups that run too small.  If you're ordering this particular brand, go up one cup size and you'll be fine.
B003NVMCW2|4|Good fit Good pant
B004IMANXK|5|I have had nothing but great experience with my card and the items purchased with this card.  Grade A!
B008WYDP1C|5|I love this sweater. It took a really long time to arrive here, but it was worth it. Looks good with leggings and boots. Great quality and its really light weigth and fresh.
B00G8S3QX6|3|Took a month to arrive. But I love tights and these are super cute and couldn't resist. Everyone thinks they're actually tattoos, which is funny cuz theyd be some terrible tats.
B00DY3B19E|5|Probably the best made hoodie under $50. Excellent quality and the fit is much more stylish than any other in it's price range. Only American giant sweatshirts are better but they are $89.
B009MQTWXY|5|The gown is nice, simple and fits well. I am a 44D and have difficulty finding things that fit well...most lingerie is made for A and B cups...the cup part stretches over so it fits any cup so there is no issue. The nice open crotch panties fit well also, and make this set a very good purchase :)
B00N9WJZ6G|5|Very nice.
B00HF4N2UO|3|Way shorter and thinner than expected.
B0084FZZ7G|5|Took a chance and this bra was perfect for me.
B00DS3UID0|5|I have already worn and washed this sweater several times and each time I wear it, it looks and feels great. The fabric is soft and holds its shape very well, all day. Perfect length to wear with leggings or jeans.
B003CLCD9K|1|It's true you get what you pay for.  This item was cheap and looked it.  Not what I was hoping for so I returned it.
B00JYBXZPI|2|They shrunk up in the wash and don't fit anymore.
B00J3ZB46C|5|Awesome shirts!!!
B0012OAM3S|5|vfry good deal
B00LGXZIQ6|5|Just got feedback from my nephew on this Christmas gift, and he LOVES it. It was a little thinner than expected, so I think it is more like a microfleece shirt than a jacket.  It is also very, very soft. GREAT purchase!
B002G9UEH2|5|I bought this hat with the coat and the gloves and all three together are a great ensemble.  They definitely are warm and shield me from the cold.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone!  Great name brand!
B005F17N2W|5|Good
B001E24M48|5|I like it
B007PUTELE|5|Very comfortable. True to size. Ordered a second one in another color :)
B00NHNDNH4|1|This little coat took over 3 weeks to arrive, then when it did finally arrive, the quality of the coat was so poor.  There was 2 black smugs on the hood, inside the coat there was a rip and the threads where already coming apart, the bear face on the back is coming off and my grandson has never worn it.  Poor quality all the way around.
B00CEY2U8A|5|Looked for an inexpensive bathrobe and came across this one which met my budget needs and look at though it would suffice. When it arrived, I was very pleased to see the high quality and correct fit.  This is a wonderful robe for the money!
B00KDRP4CY|5|I love the unique desing of the buckle
B00E9H4TN4|5|well made PVC belt. Most unusual deign and well made too. Terrific value and is probably the only red and black combo men's belt you will find on the market today. Highly recommended!
B00BSP42LE|4|I feel like the scarf appears to be longer in the picture when in fact its on the shorter side.  Also its very thin I'm afraid it might snag easily and by it being so thin its not built for warmth so I would probably wear it more in the spring summer months.  For the price its ok.
B005HBGZDS|5|This looks way better on than in the pic, will go perfect with my blue skinny jeans and black ballet flats!
B00PUUWVXO|5|Perfect fit!
B00C6PWSVG|3|Nice material and color, but a little longer than I expected. It actually goes down as long as my knees.
B00GBUGCZA|2|I had ordered a pair of these a while back in a size 10. When washed in hot water and overdried on high heat, they fit OK for a few hours but then stretched out. I order another pair in a size 8 recently and decided not to try them on. Washed and dried and wore the next weekend. They fit the same as the 10's. I won't bother to order another pair because I'm sure a 6 would be too small.
B00AG3ZMRM|4|Love it.
B00ET1V60Y|5|x
B00BWH11H6|4|fit and looks good .Little bit too long for a short men 5'5&#34;.
B00Q7UTUE4|1|Not even close to what I expected
B005MSJ2IG|5|This is the sleep mask is incredibly light weight, the big shape around the nose makes it so there is no pressure on the nose like most sleep masks, I have plenty of eye space without pressure (I even have enough space to open my eyes and blink without hitting the mask), and it is very dark so light won't get through easily. Just what I need. I ordered this one for traveling but I'm going to order another one for my home.
B006DR6PDK|5|Friends who don't know I'm carrying my camera admire this bag. Perfect for keeping my camera handy and safe. I wish more handbags were this well thought out!
B0067IP996|5|Seems to be an excellent wallet and rather well solves the issues I had with the old one..that being need for more slots for cards and a bit of additional width so it would not rotate in my back pocket.  Kudos.  Its a keeper.
B009NIIH0K|4|nice quality
B000E0QWIK|4|My aunt only wears these types of bras and she liked this one, no complaints and trust me I would have heard it if there was any,,,,,
B00H5IJ42K|3|The dress was nice but i ordered according to the chart and it came in almost two sizes too big. I had to get it tailored which cost me another 40.
B00UCFQ0AW|5|Girlfriend loves it. she looks great in them
B000S6O5VQ|1|We purchased this wig for Halloween. The length in the back was uneven and it looked like a little kid took a pair of scissors to it.  My son chose to go without the wig instead of being embarrassed by the wig.
B004JPJ0SA|3|These are fine. Not great, but they cover up what needs covering. I don't find the band real comfortable personally, and the colors/ patterns I got were more suited to a teenage girl than an adult woman, but they do what they're made to do.
B006LWAV50|5|La calidad del polar es muy buena y era exacto lo que estaba buscando. Quedé muy conforme con la compra.
B0035Y1U0C|4|it was to cold to wear the sarong on the beach. needed something more solid to try and keep warm
B00GTW3L6S|5|Excellent
B00T8ING5G|3|Too small, so sad as I loved it!
B00G5AY59G|5|Great fit
B007XVVMNI|3|I know it's a mbi skirt but it's a little shorter than I thought. But it's ok since I wear it with leggings.
B0076BFACE|5|I liked very much this article, it was fit as expected
B00Y4F8M7A|5|Beautiful Dress...runs small  Returned for next size up
B00NF3OO2E|5|The leggings are so soft and warm and they look really nice.
B009DZOQC6|3|The jeans are nice...now. When I received them someone had dumped loose glitter in the package and the jeans were covered! Major mess.  After about 10 washes all the glitter finally came off.  I gave this product 3 stars for the hassle, but the jeans are nice...without the glitter mess, I would've gladly given a 5 star.
B00NONGB94|2|Looks cheap
B001FARMLE|5|It was perfect for what I bought it for. My husband likes it and it shipped faster than I expected.
B003UGXK8U|4|I bought this sweater to replace another just like it that my 94yr. old Mom had for a long time. She likes the style because it isn't tight fitting through the body like the newer style sweaters. It is also fairly lightweight which is nice for her because she lives in a warmer climate. The small petite is plenty roomy through the body.
B00LIY24E2|4|This is a really soft, warm robe, but the &#34;one-size&#34; is a bit larger than I was hoping. I'm a size 12 and this would likely have fit me fine back when I was an 18 or 20. I'm keeping it because it's pretty and soft and I can layer under it.
B00EQ0BKZO|2|Pros: great for varied weather with double zip up systems and a second layer inside.  fresh design that I haven't seen in stores.<br /><br />Cons: this is *not* a US X-Large.  I'm a fit guy and could barely zip this up with great tightness around my arms.  If there was such a thing as skinny jeans for arms, this would be it.  I should also mention cheap zippers that are plastic with both flaps coming off shortly after purchase.<br /><br />If sizing was marketed properly and better materials were used, this would be a great product.  Very disappointed.
B00CEP1RJW|3|the print is cute and feminine, the overall look is nice. However, the opening in the back is too big, the ties helps otherwise, one could see all the way down her back. Our daughter is skinny, so it might be not an issue for some
B00QEVEQSQ|5|I wish it came in more colors. Material and size are perfect.
B007RMG4BI|5|Great skirt for the office,<br />got lots of compliments.<br />A slight problem it crushes a bit.<br />I guess thats tha cotton in the fabric.<br />Buts looks great on, you can wear it with<br />a nice top out for lunch of after work<br />for cocktails or dinner. It does have<br />a slight sheen.<br />A great skirt to have in ur closet.
B00KXPONYG|5|Good and cool soft material
B00550QVBC|5|This is a marvelous item for anyone who is pinched by other bras.  The fabric is soft and the support fabulous.  Anyone with a sensitive skin condition, this is the bra to buy!
B000AL1M5G|5|Love them. I stand on my feet all day and these shoes are perfect. Have purchased another pair and will continue to use as long as they make them.
B00FL5RVSI|5|I generally bought these sport bras for my young adult daughter from a wholesale club, but they have stopped carrying  them.  The price I found through Amazon was very competitive and the product arrived in less than a week.
B00GIIISYS|5|So cute and comfortable for toddlers
B00MH1CO90|5|Fit is perfect and looks great. Thanks!
B007C2PVVW|2|It is extremely hard to find long sleeve onesies, especially in the size we needed (3-6 months).  That being said, I was very disappointed with these.  They are extremely thin, poor fabric quality, and definitely NOT worth $10.  We will use them because we don't want to go through shipping them back, but I will certainly not order Gerber onesies again.
B00NM7TZ9U|5|Its perfect if it wasnt sold out id buy another.
B008401KQ6|3|The cap itself is okay but I am totally disappointed with the color. It is nowhere near the color shown in the picture. I have several orange garments which I wanted to wear with this hat, but since it's almost red in color, it matches nothing, making it useless to me.
B00303GOUY|3|I bought these for my son who is on the husky side. I ordered his correct size and for the first time ever, the pants fell right off. I even checked the tag to make sure I didn't order the wrong size...lol The quality was great, as Levi is but these were just not for us I guess. I later took him to the store and had a very hard time pinning him down to a particular size with Levi. We never did get one right after about 20 different sizes and styles, so we went another route. I have come to the conclusion, my son will just not be wearing Levi's. I gave a rating of 3 only because I think they were a little large even for a husky.
B001U88OAE|3|I lost my beloved Danskin Women's Mosai-Ix Crop Pants somewhere, and since they've been discontinued I decided to try another Danskin style.<br /><br />I bought these leggings in my usual size medium, and found them to be way too tight.  The material was thin and shiny, and they gave me an unflattering look in the crotch.  I expected them to be fitted, but not like pantyhose.  Maybe a large would fit better, but I wasn't all that happy with the material either.  I'm going to return them.
B00KCMBUVY|5|love the fit and the colors,
B00180G8UM|4|I've used these for the past few months when I take my granddaughter to swim classes. She is 17-months-old now and not potty trained, but luckily hasn't needed to 'contain' any solids so far while she is in the pool. It's nice to know, though, that we won't have to shut down the pool if she does poo. The elastic on the legs and the top make for a very snug fit.
B00KRMVUMI|5|love it
B00O5ZX4YU|3|Fits nice. But pointless because it's see through
B008GSEHHK|4|Very happy w/dress better than I expected when I ordered it.<br />Would recomment it to any one thinking of buying it.
B002BZOFKI|3|Will do the job
B0002THXDG|5|This fit great and I plan to order more.  The tights seem durable also, and like they will hold up for a long time.  They are very comfortable.
B000HW14YM|5|Great legging for the price. Loose fitting, do not expect a high quality product for this price. You can get what u pay for.
B00A8LDH2Y|3|Top quality materials. Item runs small on sizing. I wasnt crazy about the super baggy upper arm area of the sleeves. Maybe its designed as such for true military functionality.
B00CHYE8JQ|4|So far, so good.  I'm in California so I save the shirt for those special days!  If and when this shirt falls apart, I'll get another...for sure!
B000MXLYZ0|5|Fit perfect, and good quality product, would buy again.
B0085IFRTS|4|I am six foot two I find that the arm lenght to be way to long! Its made well keeps me warm but the lenght is too long.
B004196398|4|I ordered this skirt because it looked nice for the price. And as expected when it arrived it looked nice for the price. I got exactly what I was expecting. I will say that it runs a little smaller than I would have preferred. I ordered a size large because I have muscular legs and am quite shapely but I only weigh 132 lbs.  It fits but I wish I had a size up. I gave it 4 stars because it's a classic looking piece and although not high quality, when you put your outfit together it looks good. I would order this again.
B000QW6LJQ|2|product in pic seem to be comfortable and promise lot of thing that its not true really not like it
B00MXXONYG|5|Fits well and he loves it
B00M8S2L3G|4|I like them. Nice quality
B00D279WP2|5|Just what we needed.  Good quality
B00F6FKVVW|5|My daughter in law said they're great
B003ZHOX9Y|3|Needed different size bra, and thought this might do it, however, ended up being wrong size which made me happy when I could return it for free.  After going to Her Room web site at http://www.herroom.com/bra-fitting-center,954,30.html and using their &#34;brafitguide&#34; I was finally able to measure myself at home and understand that if your band size changes, your cup size needs to change also and how they relate.  Subsequently, I have purchased the right size for me.
B005GYGEXC|5|They are so comfortable!
B00E4I11Q6|5|looks great, feels great, overall i'm very happy with this shirt.
B00CL0HPZU|4|For the price paid, the scarf was very nice.  Loved the colors and the feel of the scarf.  Very lightweight and soft.
B000VZ5SOC|4|The wigs fit correctly & were of good quality. They worked great for our Company Talent Show skit.
B008JTTPMS|4|Good quality leather
B005N7Z0DC|4|This was convenient to have in the first trimester.  It helped me close my pants that were uncomfortable, but still mostly fit.  It is not super reliable for pants that don't come close to closing anymore, as my pants would slide down as I moved around at work (teacher).  I liked that it kept my stomach covered as my shirts grew too short, and I like that it was very soft and stretchy.  It washes well, and both of the bands that I have look brand new.  I would recommend nude for most applications, as the darker colors were more noticeable (even with dark pants).  At the time I was wearing this band, I didn't want people to notice my pregnancy, so the less obvious, the better.  It fit true to size.
B00528VJD2|5|My favourite bra to date. Full coverage and very comfortable
B00A4HL1M0|5|Very nice and I think I will be using it a lot this winter.  It's prettier in &#34;person&#34; than online.
B0077C88NU|4|I read a few of the comments and decided to order a medium as opposed to a large and these tanks fit well.  I'm a bit stocky, about 5'7and usually wear a large in regular shirts and 17 34/35  for dress shirts. Haven't played in it yet but I don't foresee any issues with the fit. Great Price and fast shipping from the company.
B001GUM9E8|3|The jacket is warm and fairly high quality, but for the price I was a little disappointed.  The black jacket had kind of whitish dusty streaks on it (sure it will wash out) and several stray hanging threads.  Cleaned it up as best I could, but no time to return before the holiday.  Probably wouldn't have bothered anyway.  The jacket was still nice, just looked a little used.  Would definately not purchase this brand without seeing it in person now.
B0054N2YHU|5|ok.
B00BN6QQIU|5|Beautiful dress!
B008G152E4|3|My error - not what I thought the product would be.  Did not return product in the event I might have a use for these in the future.
B00JQ3VVSW|4|Nice dress , haven't wear  it yet.. I'm waiting for perfect day on summer
B009B999CG|5|Beautiful
B00BVX7S8W|1|Ordered a large got an extra small :(
B008GVFXRU|2|I recently lost my first case.  Liked it enough to purchase another.  Sturdy, nice size (would fit most sports size sunglasses), fairly sleek.  Only complaint I would have is that the felt-type liner material tends to shed a bit.  So I usually have to clean off my shades before putting them on.  Follow up review 9/11/2015: I should have posted this months ago, but this case lasted less than a year.  Which is disappointing given my initial review.  The insides of BOTH my cases came loose in less than a year.  The glue apparently degrades to the point that the liner, plastic and all, separates from the clam shell.  I have therefore also downgraded my review to two stars.
B00I5VCS6A|1|I bought this skirt thinking it would be the perfect denim pencil skirt to add to my closet. When I got the skirt there were threads hanging around the zipper top to bottom. I thought ok no big deal. I'll just clip the hanging threads. When I put on the skirt, initially I thought the fit was great so I wore it. I was literally wearing the skirt for 30mins when the zipper burst open revealing EVERYTHING!!! I was in public and had to rush home to change! I would have returned it but the pink tag they loop through the skirt said once removed skirt wouldn't be returnable. I did not feel like the headache. I will literally NEVER EVER EVER buy or recommend anyone else buy from this vendor or brand ever!!! Terrible Quality!!!!!! Waste of money!!!!!!!!!!
B00061O5M2|1|The suspenders were too wide for may liking.  I would like something with a width of 1&#34;.  I will be sending these back.
B002OF4384|3|Bought for Granddaughter. This item was too expensive, I could have bought one at AT&T park for $20.
B004P5878S|1|The arms were sewn on crooked. I had to unstitch them and most of the neck and torso... then saw that the stitches by the hips were falling apart. so, I don't know if I should give up. This was a bummer
B00L34AZK2|5|Wig is amazing quality espeically for the price! 5/5 Stars! Will buy from again! Thank you so much :)!
B007H0WGNK|5|I followed the advice of other reviewers and ordered the 5T for my niece who normally wears a 4T. It does run about a size too small, but knowing this in advance was good. It fit perfectly and was so adorable on her and comfy looking. Very pleased with the outfit and will buy from Leveret again! Thank you.
B00DDVV5CU|5|This gives your body a nice silhouette under dresses, especially knit clothing. I usually wear size 6 and the small/medium fit well. I will definitely be adding more colors to my wardrobe.
B003H6KHOS|5|I am post partum and was looking for something to hide that post baby belly. Really does the trick to hide that tummy!
B005IUN1I0|3|Soft and really big lije it says wlyhought it tears easy at the ends... Really good price tho
B00JEMOUJM|4|Very comfortable dress to wear.
B00BRZO0K8|5|These have long &#34;legs&#34; giving them the perfect slouch.  The foot is not too thick and I'm able to wear boots with no issues.  They've held up well.
B00D8408YI|4|This came in only black and white, it doesn't look like the photo which has the grey down the sides. It also doesnt look as nice as the photo, just sort of cheap. It fits good though.
B00GPZE90G|4|Fits
B00H3WDNX4|5|great head cover get lots of complements. good quality and everyone at the Cancer Center wants to know where I got them.  I love to have a selection to match my clothes
B00AF30JXU|2|Bit tight and therefore uncomfortable
B001SIPZUI|5|Awesome
B0060OQF54|3|The top is very cute and fits perfect.  Our daughter is 'long and lean' though, and the pants are too baggy even though we went with a smaller size.  If you have a chubbier baby, they will probably fit fine.  They were also short on her, more like capri pants (but i don't recall them being described as such).
B00KYB9Y5C|5|This outfit is super cute and worth every penny!  Quality of stitching and seams is very good.
B00E9ZW7YE|3|Smaller than I expect. The cuffs are too tight.
B00565WCS2|5|I was very apprehensive about buying these since they are Juniors, but I have a hard time finding jeans that fit me. So I ordered the largest size and these have now become my go to jeans! They fit perfect! And so comfortable! No muffin top for this girl! LOL
B00CQJRBFA|4|bought this  swinsuit for my daughter and she loves it.fits well.
B002YQWGS2|5|good
B00LZFJMTE|2|The material is really cheap
B0012QHNPG|2|While this cami is attractive enough, after a few hours, it starts curling up from the bottom.  Not  only is it uncomfortable, but creates an unsightly bump around your middle.
B0038JQUQI|4|These are perfect to wear in the office to keep my hands warm and still type! They are just my style, too!
B00GCB6PQO|5|Great!  Light - weight.  Love it for work. Very comfortable.
B00AIKUA8E|4|I bought a pair of these pants online, expecting them to be a good quality denim. When I opened the package and felt the material, I could tell right away that these are not denim jeans. They are made out of a knit material that reminds me of a very good quality sweatshirt. Just looking at the pants, you cannot tell they are not denim, but when you wear them, you as the wearer can definitely tell.<br /><br />With that being said, the material is incredibly soft and holds its shape well. I've worn them a few times and they don't get the saggy butt like a lot of jeans. The material has just enough stretch for a comfortable fit. These pants are also very comfortable to wear tucked into boots. With real denim jeans, sometimes the seams are uncomfortable against my skin when tucked into boots. Because these pants are so soft and not stiff denim, I don't experience the uncomfortableness with the seams.
B00FNBYJN0|4|Great shirt, although we haven't washed it yet.  So not sure if it will shrink or not, hopefully not!
B00FT3AAZS|5|Really soft and a beautiful color.  Plan to get it monogrammed and give as a gift, a little plain on it's own.
B00DDQX28A|5|Excellent fit and quality. Love the lace front panel.
B00DTU7FHY|5|These are constructed to a very high standard, fit well and exceed my expectations.  A quality product with great style.
B000A38D38|5|Good fit and comfortable. Very happy with the product, price and shipping time
B004DGJJX6|5|like and enjoy wearing my socks, always ear during the winter months
B00740HQHO|5|awesome booties
B0060OCBA2|4|VERY CUTE AND HAS QUALITY
B00BLMC41Y|2|The logo is no where near the center of the shirt.
B00L67EMBY|5|loved it had to reorder it was to small
B00B1ZNT24|3|I wear  a 2x sometime  1x.  I usually  order these blouse type tops larger because of my shoulders and arms.  However while this shirt is very pretty.  It runs very very small.
B000VV7VUA|4|I got this hat for a party it was a big hit. First I was thinking of making one but it was more cost effective to buy it. I was surprised by how well the hat was constructed. This will now be the hat I wear to fantasy drafts!
B008SAE0VE|5|This is a nice shirt. I live in the land of Big Red...Nebraska. This shirt disappoints the locals which is an A+ in my book. The fit is a bit small, so I ordered an XXL. It fits perfect. I'm 6'2&#34; and I have wide shoulders. Love the Michigan Crest, and it's a great way to homage to my homeland.
B00ICD5Z0W|5|great t-shirt
B00DIFHVQU|5|Perfect fit
B00K6O0MH6|5|Excellent fit and style
B002S6APTK|5|The fit on this costume is nice. In my experience before now no one made a side that was small enough for me so the fact I came in x-small was a huge plus. The material is nice, and not scratchy or uncomfortable. The quality of this costume was higher then other costumes of his variety
B00Y0DCZ2Y|3|Arms are very tight. I may have to cut and hem
B00M25ZC04|5|I ordered a medium and it fits perfect and the material is great.
B00BPPK4FK|5|Got this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He thought I had spent at least $30 on the shirt. It looks so good! Definitely worth every penny
B00B1FSWEO|5|I wear this shirt all the time! Has yet to fade! It's just the best!! I'm very pleased and I plan on buying a lot more Avette Brother shirts!
B00NQUHT6O|2|Wished they had stated in bolder letters what country sizes they go by.
B00U483SPW|3|Very tight even on a moderate build. Girlfriend (it was a present) would not recommend.
B001BLPQ4M|5|This tag has a bright, yellow color and can be spotted easily on the conveyor belt. I like the small space for name and address. I actually affixed my address label in the see-through window on the tag. I recommend them.
B00BRQ7ON2|4|But they are a little tight and VERY long.  I'm 5.5 and they are way too long for me.  So if you are have very long legs these pants would be great.  OH... they smell like rubber when you first get them so wash them.
B000EXQ00M|5|I have purchased many pairs of these pants.  I believe that they are my husband's favorites!  They look nice, wear well, and are wrinkle-free right out of the dryer.  The comfort waistband is another real plus for those long workdays.  Amazon's price is great and with my prime membership you just can't beat them!
B001KUA5MM|4|I am 5'10&#34; 190lbs I am in between a medium and large and this large fits perfect. I ordered the black hoodie in a medium and it ended up being a very tight fit.
B00FXVFJ20|5|I am normally a US size 6-8  and I ordered an XL, it fits great. so just order up as all other reviews say too and you will be good!
B00JTT9PLI|5|I loved the beautiful dress and the company was a great company to order from. I would recommend ordering from them! They work well with toy and everything. The dress was beautiful also? It was made smaller but it was beautifull
B00OPZDWLU|5|Very nice. Fit well.
B00HYU0RG6|5|as expected
B00C4O1KQI|1|this feels like women's clothing because it is so thin and stretchy like a blouse.<br />the buttons on both the chest/collar and sleeves are tiny so they keep coming undone.<br />the colors look better online than in person. when you see them up close they clash against each other horribly.
B0085VH3SI|3|Fine
B0002OQBD4|5|Was bought for my husband as a gift for our 10 year anniversary trip.  He loved them.  Though he hasn't warn them yet, they look very comfy and true to size.
B00920BYXQ|5|It was only a tad bit large but that's what I wanted because she, my twin daughter will wear it twice 1st Nov. and 2nd in May 2015. This is a great beautiful high  guality dress that we bought, very HAPPY
B00DVQUTC4|3|This bra fits smaller than expected. I had to use the bra extenders clasps just to be able to wear it. Its the same size as my other Bravado bras but it fits so much smaller (not in the cups). So the extender digs into my shoulder blade and the straps keep falling down and they are as tight as they can possibly go. I would not buy this bra again.
B00PV5MMKU|3|i8ts upto my expectation
B0089N5P8M|5|received on time. the quality of this hat is excellent. the bill is sturdy and the rounded shape holds. the body of the hat keeps it's shape as  well. not a wimpy hat. well constructed. Highly recommend.  AIRBORNE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001NTV4BG|5|looks good
B00QEXQ16O|1|Fit in all the wrong places. Was very disappointed.
B00N34Q0AO|3|The cut isn't quite as flattering as it appears in the picture.
B00FJ5LW6M|5|This is one of the best ones I have owned yet , hope someday thay come out with a purple iys my favorite color , for anyone who uses one this would be the best quality out there
B002ET2V5W|5|I wear a 7 1/4 and this hat was a little large. but worked well over the colonial wig I bought. other tricorn hats I tried were way too small.
B0053XF8WO|4|I'm a Medium but ordered the Large as everyone suggested.  It fits perfectly.  I love the boy short design as you don't get any squish bulges out back and don't have the extra leg material.
B00HFE5KZ4|3|I really liked the waist cincher and I can tell it's going to work well, it's just two sizes too small.
B00553XN1U|4|I took the advice of some other reviewers and ordered my normal cup size but one band size up-- glad I did, otherwise I don't think I would have been able to clasp the bra.  I like that this is adjustable.  My only real complaint is that the fabric is a little itchy... I've washed a few times to try to soften it up and it has helped.  There isn't total bounce control for me, even on the tightest clasp, but this works well enough to get me through brisk walking.  For jogging and dance aerobics I'd still prefer something with more bounce control.
B00FRQXCTS|5|Love these pants! Vibrant colors and fun to wear! Get so many compliments on them. These are my favorite leggings now.
B00K5LB2VA|4|Fit way better than I thought it would
B00G7GVZ9G|5|Awesome product! Fits perfectly !! For my 2year old
B00AHOWSZO|4|For the price this is a really nice dress. As others have written in their reviews, I had to shorten the straps about an inch in length to prevent indecent exposure. I will wear it to an awards banquet this week-end, and probably on a cruise in the future
B008MATQP0|4|what an I say it works as described. I feel like a sausage being stuffed in its casing but hey that's my fault not the shirts lol
B00FGKZBS0|1|I don't write many reviews but this left me very disappointed! I was looking forward to receiving this coat; In fact, I almost bought 2 on my first order - one of each color - but my friend convinced me to just buy one and see how i like it. Thank god for friends.<br /><br />First, the coat was much bigger than expected - i ordered a large, but should've just went with a medium. I look like a pregnant blimp. No biggie though.<br /><br />The most annoying thing about this coat is the zipper! I don't know if I received a defective coat, but almost EVERY single time the zipper gets snagged! This happened even the first time i zipped the coat. It seems that the cloth around the zipper was cut too long and so, unless you are guiding the zipper inch-by-inch to ensure that the cloth doesn't get caught, it's a guaranteed extra 2 min of pulling at the zipper to get it unsnagged. Picture this: You have to stop a conversation w/ a friend getting up from a lunch date and try to get this zipper up. You now have 3 people trying to assist in moving the cloth aside so that the zipper can reach the top. -_-<br /><br />I bought this in December right before my holiday travel so i've been planning to return, possibly for an exchange (b/c to be fair, it looks & feels alright to me), but I think i've read somewhere about a 30 day return policy. I really hope i haven't missed my window as otherwise i've wasted a lot of money and still don't have a decent winter coat. :-(.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/7/2015<br /><br />At first I thought maybe i got a defective coat (b/c of the zipper problem), but now I'm convinced that this is the cheapest expensive item i've ever purchased. I'm actually insulted. I'm pretty nonchalant, so that is out of my element.  When I first wrote my review, I had worn the coat for about a week. The zipper was the primary complaint i had. Though it was a nuisance, my go-with-the-flow personality just stuck with it, albeit i experienced the zipper issue every. single. time. I used it.<br /><br />Week 2 and feathers are visibly coming out of the seams?!!!!  And i mean all over! Whattt?! How cheeaaap! It's getting on all of my clothes too! THis should not be happening days after wearing a coat. Especially when I only wear the coat for minutes out the day! Further even the pocket zippers are snagging, not to mention that the pockets are so shallow that i can barely fit my samsung galaxy 5 in it.<br /><br />I'm almost convinced this is a scam and that the good reviews are from friends of the designer. What I'm sure of though is that the profit margins must be astronomical. Not even decently sewn. The designer should be ashamed. I would never market such a poor product with my name on it. And then charge $189?!!! Offensive. Never again Jessie J.visibly coming out of the seams?!!!!  And i mean all over! Whattt?! How cheeaaap! It's getting on all of my clothes too!

B001PU9A9Q|5|They are a little bigger than I expected, but they work great and I would not want to be without a pair.
B004UOVT0W|4|I received this dress today and it's ok.   I would most definitely order 2 sizes larger. I'm a 22 and ordered a 26. It just fits.  It is a bit snug. The material is a bit rough. Other than that, it's ok.
B009287SYW|4|Very comfortable. Love them
B00EZWO0T6|4|Probably ordered to large.  Still a great runners tank top.
B00075ZXZU|4|these pants are quite comfortable. I would have rather had shorter legs but they only came in tall. The elastic cuffs are not too tight so I pull the legs up that way
B000JJM9VK|1|I was fooled by the term \\"bonded leather.\\" I thought that meant various layers of leather, bonded together. Nope! It means it's made out of plastic, with some shredded, recycled leather mixed in. So it's actually made out of plastic, and it looks and feels like plastic. It's also much darker than the item photo. It says \\"Charcoal Gray,\\" but it might as well say \\"Coal black.\\"<br /><br />This was a bad idea, but I've learned my lesson. No more \\"bonded leather\\" for me, thank you.
B00CEMMFY6|5|Wow!!! The quality of this product is great, I have paid much more for other name brands which turned out to be poor quality. I love the fit!!! I would love to find this profuct in RED!
B00LB9GAS0|2|I order the right size of socks and they fit well, but the socks kept on falling off from my heels.  The silicon heel grip is not working well, and I wish I could return the product since it did not meet my expectation. I bought this because it clams that the silicon heel grip would work. I have had bought others that worked much better than these.
B00D3FBW4C|4|Good product
B00JCU1UCG|5|Really comfortable fabric, crest doesn't stretch too much, I'm about 5'4 and I weigh 145
B00DDXO1G0|5|Product was nice, fit as directed!
B00I0DMAEI|5|Love it! Can't keep it clean often enough for little girl to wear it. Order a size bigger because it does shrink but still good quality!
B00535C708|5|I found this hat to meet all expectations.  It fits just right, is great for hot or cold weather, and great to work in.  It folds into a very small space<br />for carrying, and unfolds nicely to regain its original shape.  I have no complaints about this hat.
B00JZCDWKY|5|Absolutely LOVE this wallet! I've been looking for ages for a bigger wallet but was never satisfied until I bought this one. I bought the silver and it's just gorgeous. It smells a little funky when you first open it but a lot of things do and the smell fades quickly. I highly recommend it! (I'm actually buying one for a friend in a different color for Christmas!)
B00F0C9ERI|4|Looks good.
B00SSVATOK|3|I really like this blouse,I ordered a xlarge but unfourtually it was too tigh!!!
B00CMLRNB4|1|to small
B002ABNQ5S|3|The over all it's ok but the sizes are too big, I order a l and the pants are falling down, I though I got skinny but no:( the pants are to big!
B00HWOBR40|1|Wears like a diaper in the back
B005SZH0Y6|3|Nice quality but somewhat too big
B00K7IOAT2|4|The back support on this was really unexpectedly great post partum, but my complaint with all of these Velcro bindings is that if you have curvy hips, the Velcro doesn't perfectly overlap and my belly ended up getting very scratched up. This was a particularly bad problem for me as I also got very itchy with it and couldn't use it for as long as I would have liked. But a very helpful product overall.
B00AZ6U1OE|1|this shorts have no elastic and also sizes are misleading they are way too big. it would be ok if they had some elastic at all.
B000VK2KVG|5|This is my third Glamorise bra and I will continue to buy more!
B00GDZBF0K|2|I'm not a big guy - I usually wear jeans that are 30w 32l.<br />These are quite tight and they really don't add much warmth.<br /><br />Rather unimpressed.
B00BUGZV5W|5|great quality!  just be careful when ordering, I'm a size 14 pants and I had to return the XL for a medium.  NOT the size I expected.
B00EGGM6YM|4|Excellent fit and wear. The only issue I have is some of them have small tears or holes near some of the seams prior to wearing.
B009YPX24S|5|One of the best shirts I've ever had. Comfortable, and fits perfectly. I'm definitely buying more.
B00327R9SE|5|Love love love best jeans I've bought in a long long time!! I usually go to Bloomingdales for my high end denim And spend hours upon hours trying them on and I was nervous to get theses on line .... I saved money time and tons of my sanity !!! They came fast fit perfect love them!<br />My only side note would be with good denim as with 7's I always get one size too small bc they tend to stretch in the but and waist after an hour of wear so I suggest buying them a bit smaller by a size I promise if u have a small to no but like my self this is the way to buy them:)
B00L6IO5WE|5|We've bought a ton of Cuddl Duds over the past winter. The cotton ones run a bit smaller than advertised, but the other fabrics run true to size. These were the best brand and they, on sale, are a great value.
B00284B5JQ|5|This is the best shape wear i've bought. So comfortable and soft and doesn't show underneath tight clothes including pants. It won't make you look like you have have lost 30 pounds but it definitely makes you look great. I loved it so much, I had to purchase another one.<br /><br />By the way, I wear a medium (10) in clothes so I bought this in medium also!!
B00G3BLY1E|5|we bought 2 of these ...we love them....great quality
B001HXYYAG|5|This is a very nice t-shirt that helps you to show support for our president.
B00DJIH6V6|3|I am short so it fit ok but it was too long.
B00GIA3Y8Q|5|I really liked this vest.  It is a heavier vest that will be good for fall and winter.  It sits a little past the waist and great for laying.  I just ordered another one.  I am 164 lbs and 5'7
B0041HN2W6|5|Very cute looks just like the picture and size is great for the table.  Ihave it outside on the deck had a windy day the chair moved on the deck but not the ashtray.  great buy!  Will buy as a gift!!
B00976MKQA|5|todo bien.... gracias llego muy rapido  de muy buena calidad. . . . . . . . . . .
B00SYS4Q1Y|4|The chains are cheap, and broke when trying it on.  It wasn't attached to the gown either. However, the other downside this came with so many extra straps, I had no clue what they were for. It was a pain to put on by myself,I had to have my boyfriend help me.  The black strips didn't hit me where they should. This one was a bust, it's pretty, silky soft, and fun. Just not for me.<br />sample provided
B00CC75BTE|5|I bought for my 1 yr old daughter. She fits well in 18mons sized clothes. It fit perfectly and looks comfortable. These are used as a pajama for all weathers.
B00BBB3GIA|5|This is advertised as XXXL but it is not XXXL, it is size 20-22 and fits appropriately for that size.
B00MVR689W|2|I bought it for 3 to 6 months and the shirt was perfect but the pants were way too big it was for a 1 or 2 year.
B0091FNF84|5|I was shopping for my granddaughter, made point with that 6 year old. Love the bright color, just a perfect top.
B00KDXPUFE|5|Nice coat with lots of pockets
B00PIKZNGS|5|Bought it for a friend for secret Santa, and it was a success he loved it! Just as pictured, great quality, Thank you!
B005HNWJ8G|3|Product has same construction as older model, but uses lighter fabric that streches out during the day and leaves legs loose by end of work day. One pair has already begun to come apart at the seams after only 3 time thru wash. Not as pleased with them as I was Dickies older style of Boxer/breifs, they were heavy weight material, held up to full day of working, did not ride up in the legs. lasted for yrs.
B00OWMPD22|5|Love this shirt!
B0089SX692|5|Comfy, form fitting. Look and feel like a bawss
B0062ODGUE|4|If you are a 34&#34;, and order a 36&#34;, you will only have 2&#34; to spare when buckled. It appears that the &#34;size&#34; is the actual belt length, and NOT a comfortable fitting size. I like my belts to have at least a 4&#34; tail in excess when buckled. if you are a 34, I'd recommend ordering a 38&#34;, if not a 40&#34;.<br /><br />The only other thing to note; is that the belt is a bit thinner than i would like. We'll see how it holds up.
B00595R48C|5|The lace on this bra is very soft.  It's really pink and not nude.  You can see the hot pink on the underwire a little bit from the outside but a sheer bra like that is not a good choice under a sheer shirt anyway.<br />One of my favorites -- I have the black too but this seems softer.
B00C6U0IGS|5|Cute halloweeen costume!
B00FE0G44M|5|Super sexy on wife, a little see through, and HOT!  Great for a night out or a night in!  Love it!
B00N1U7BBM|5|Thanks
B00IIJHLG6|1|totally misshaped. threw it away before the end of the night.. was not worth the money or effort to return
B000MX5XMU|5|Love it! Great support and stays comfortable throughout the day
B00DS0J58W|5|Amazing quality for the price!  I didn't expect them to look this great!  I'm buying another pair!  Leather quality is sumptuous.  Fit is perfect.
B00JDADS8E|1|Shipping was fast just wasn't close to the size it should have been.
B001ULDNAM|4|great fabric and great fit. great value. they hold the body firmly and snugly yet are flexible and pliable to move with the body. i've paid a lot more for similar items.
B0019PMGOS|5|Love them!
B008UYQYEO|5|These are slim but very warm and I hardly notice them under my bike helmet.  Much better than the &#34;Swix&#34; thin muffs I used to wear.  I also like that the fleece can be detached for washing.  I'll never go back!  Some might have a problem with the lack of adjustability usually found in 180 ear warmers, but these worked for me just fine.
B00FMA0XBY|5|Outfit was perfect for my 3 year old.
B00CN47JNW|4|I usually wear a large in sweaters so they don't fit snug and this L seemed like a XL but I still love it! Nice and cozy
B00N24V09G|5|This is very cute.
B003ZW8D2W|4|Like the style very much.  The size fitted a tad larger than I expected, unless I've lost weight from working out!!!!  I will buy another in a smaller size.
B00HAHJCGO|5|it is exactly as the picture in the website. It is very good.
B00BV2TDUE|5|It's very good and uh... It's a... Very awesome... Jeez it hard to meet the requirement of this review e
B00GFKWADE|5|So in love with it
B00BGVVQL4|5|I love my outfit and so does everyone else that sees my outfit.
B00SCCEYKK|5|This was a gift for my granddaughter.  She is very happy with the T-shirt.
B004D98NAI|3|I originally bought this because I wanted to do a weave. I like the shirt but the fit was slightly poor. It is oddly shaped for women. It's more boxy like men's shirts, but for the price it was good.
B00245ISVM|5|The coat is awesome. Tons of pockets, good material. I just had to exchange my medium for a small. If you're around a size 38-40 in a suit coat (even if you have broad shoulders like I do) get a small.
B001SLFA28|5|As expected
B00IL4J9FO|5|I like or love the song or item. I do not know what else to type after I rate it.
B00H4KBRHE|4|has a red stripe in it that is not shown a little thin but soft
B00ACD8O0I|5|This top looks exactly how it does in photo. The material is stretchy. Soo comfy. Im 5'8&#34; approx 160lbs. I have a lil junk in the trunk so its difficult to find tops that cover my backside, especially with leggings. I ordered a Medium and it fits perfectly. Adorable with leggings or skinny jeans. I would suggest wearing a tank or cami underneath cause if its winter, it isnt the warmest of tops.
B00589DH4E|5|Awesome shirt!
B00OSAUD5A|5|Very well made product. Fits well, looks great.
B007XVL8S2|4|Super cute colors - can't beat that.  A toe hold developed after a year, but nothing that some string can't fix
B00JLJJAA2|4|Fit okay. But can't zip it up. Too tight around the waist when I try to zip.
B00N9HT8KE|3|Love the jeans. They are a little tight, wish I had known they ran small.
B00OJF0VS8|3|It's a vary cute dress! The only problem I have is that they took this delicate dress and fixed it with an industrial zipper sturdier than my jeans have.  The zipper never lays quite right on my back so I'm always a little worried about it when I wear it.
B00DVXYPRM|1|Really small,no we'll adjust.Very poor quality,very disappoint<br />.Save your money for something<br />Better.very cheap material.And don t look like the picture is no sexy at all.
B003IC0JI0|4|I am glad that I read the reviews before purchasing this costume at the last minute for our community Halloween party.  One reviewer said it runs large so I ordered a small/medium instead of the large/extra large.  It fit nicely over my clothes, and was comfortable enough to enjoy a sit-down dinner and some dancing.  The hat stayed on and upright.  The evening was a success.
B00S034TTW|5|Love it! Great look and fit! Fox never disappoints!
B00MUHCEZK|4|This fit pretty well for a &#34;one size&#34; dress. Ok quality for the price. It is pretty short- it barely covers my bum with fabric, the fringe goes just below and I am 5'3&#34;. Nice V-neck cleavage. I would recommend for a flapper party.
B00K4WRY4Y|5|Soft.  Perfect.
B00024F0MM|5|This is the best thing i've ever seen.  I love the string of bubbles so much i tried them on while my wife was at work. 5 stars easy! HOT! However, perhaps a better view of the product could help amazon customers choose the item. I know i'd love to see it and that it would probably have made us make the decision much quicker. In the words of our teenage son this product is \\"dope\\"!
B00K25M3EY|5|This Item is great! keeps me warm in the winter time, and its organic cotton to!  Why did I pick it? easy its organic!<br /><br />Very high quality item, I would love to see a matching top!  My organic t-shirts go on then a fleece shirt but I would rather put on this in a top form, then something over it.  Please make the same in a top form!
B00829P6IC|5|Just got my order today, i love it! Sooo cute, super soft and comfy. Perfect fit!
B00IA3T12M|4|Great deal. It's thin fabric, and I suspect it will wear quickly, but it's opaque enough to wear to yoga for the time being.
B00C7WQA6C|4|My wife is not a Maxi dress wearer. She felt she wouldn't like the leg restrictions. We went to the fair and where there for several hours(mostly outdoors). When night came it got a little cool. When we drove home that night she very pleased because it was thin enough to not get hot during the late summer day in upstate NY and her legs did not get cold as the temperature dropped at night. My wife is short(5'0&#34;) and the dress fits snug, but that's by design. We did have to trim about 4&#34; from the bottom because it is long. (size small). Now she like Maxi's. I like them on women because I think they're sexier then women wearing mini skirts and and all body types can wear them. But that's just me. I'll get another with a loose fitting design.
B00HNCRHFO|4|Bought this for my husband as he is sometimes style-challenged. Love the sexy sailor look.  It's warm, soft and looks great on him.
B00DG8VJM6|1|The dress is way to small, like a children size
B00RO1WMUY|4|Nice fit. nice colors. Would recommend.
B002FA0BRA|4|We live in Florida and I was trying to find something less hot than all of the warm fuzzy costumes for 2 year olds; this was a good compromise, however it didn't breathe very much. It could definitely fit a range of sizes because it can be worn baggy. It was a huge hit, there definitely weren't other kids with this costume!
B003NTUEUG|5|Love my hat. Looks great
B00ARBXS3I|2|Very sorry that I ordered this leopard belt.  It was very cheap looking and not made well.  The diamonds on this belt really made it look worse.
B002R0FD26|2|My daughter wears a size 10/12 girls normally. I read reviews and saw that it ran small. Ordered the 12/14. WAY too small. Returned via Amazon and ordered the adult XS. XS is supposed to be size 2/4. IF she wears an adult size it is usually a 00. This was too small also!!! I just returned for the small. We'll see what the next one brings.<br /><br />Quality feels very good though. They just really need to resize.
B008H5OP9W|5|These trunks look great and are extremely comfortable.  They're so light, you barely feel like you're wearing anything.  They don't bind or pull on you as you move, sit or contort, but at the same time are trim enough and drape well enough to make a sharp presentation.<br /><br />I read the online reviews carefully, understood that the waist sizing runs small, got the larger of my two candidate sizes, and got a perfect fit.<br /><br />I wanted a short that stopped just above the knee as in the online images.  But, they showed the same images for the 18&#34; and 20&#34; short.  To make matters worse, the images showed three, wide, complete bands.  But the (shorter) 18&#34; I ended up getting has four bands.  So what has three?  I think I found some site that gave the models' stats for comparison and measured per instructions.  I'm 5' 11&#34; with an little extra proportion of my height in my torso.<br /><br />The trunks have a trim-line, sturdy, plastic zipper, which I think is the best.  Velcro is bulky, stiff and harsh, doesn't always lay flat, and attracts bits of junk.  Buttons are a pain, too much work.  Metal zippers?  No.<br /><br />Like the side pocket.  Accessible.  You don't end up sitting on your glasses on a bike.<br /><br />The material is smooth (poly & spandex) and unlike some other smooth materials, these shorts have not been pulled and abraded by things like sitting on sand, cement or a textured bench.<br /><br />It looks like many of the colors are out of stock now.  But, I found at the time of purchase that some colors were misrepresented.  Presumably the vendor preferred to show an image of something rather than &#34;no image.&#34;  So, beware of any image that's too far off from its color name or looks the same as another image of a different color name.<br /><br />I was happy enough with these that I bought them in a second color.  The first one was oddly called &#34;Stone/Black.&#34;  It reads as wide bands of black and white thin stripes, andblack and dark gray thin stripes.  The second pair, again oddly, was called &#34;Black.&#34;  Its striping pairs are black and charcoal, along with black and blue-gray (but less blue than in the online image).  So, unlike with the length, the images seemed correct.  My favorite is the Stone/Black because they pop.<br /><br />I've taken good care of the shorts and after a year, they still look like new.
B00OQW0ZXK|5|This hat is great! It fits well and is super warm.
B00GBULKMK|5|it is very nice product, easy to use, does not occupy much space and serve to light the extreme cold
B0014MGAYS|4|3 different snap sizes, works just as expected!
B00KBUOOP6|4|Loved the product
B00LONM3DO|5|Fit and looks great.  The best one I ordered.  Will order again.
B00166VEEI|5|This shjirt is exactly what I wanted.  It is well made, the fabric is great.  It is long enough, everything about it pleases me ...
B007Y4H4N6|5|Great PJ. I had originally purchased it for a surgery and didn't think I'd ever wear it again but it's very comfy and soft. I think they could have done without the snaps along the side. All in all I love it.
B00ESMW2RK|5|This dress is beautiful the belt tie did ristrict from a perfect fit in the waist area do to the tie being fixed to the waist. This is a great a spring/summer or easter dress.
B00VQNU726|5|Sexy, As He%%!! Love, Them On Her!!  ;)
B00KSSFWAW|4|Nice
B00K5T87TM|5|perfect fit, warm.
B00KDMZT5G|2|The print looked horrible ... The back and front like can see where was ironed on . And it didn't fit right ... I bought it for someone who was in the 10 mountain and he said he couldn't wear that in public looks horrible . I will never buy from this company again
B0044BD1UC|3|Hello, this dress is really nice to look at, but it seems to be really short, what is the finished length of it.
B00HJ1PXVE|4|as expected
B005IVZ0II|4|The dress is actually very cute and has a good weight to it, but I didn't notice originally in the picture is that there are \\"jewels\\" sewn in with the embroidery at the bottom of the dress. Of course, my daughter LOVES the jewels, but it means I wash the dress separately on delicate.
B00NB1LN1A|1|The wires piped out of thw corset and I haven't even worn it yet
B001A9YNUI|5|Looks nice but I am still looking for one to fit the back of my jacket. The best Doctor who logo ever
B006E8P0L6|5|Love it!
B00M7FQ3UW|5|I love them, They are so comfortable.  I even wear the solid colored ones for my softball ball games.....
B00A0KVWKM|5|I was looking for robes for my Guest Suite and these are perfect. They wash up nicely and dry quickly. Yes I would recommend this robe.
B0053NVODQ|5|I needed something for my baby to wear to keep her warm but not be too bulky to wear in her car seat. The sweatshirt seemed a little big for the size, but I didn't mind because that just meant she could wear it longer.  Unfortunately, it got stained after a few wears so she doesn't get as much use out of it as we planned.
B008BL245O|5|So gorgeous that I use it as a mini-tapestry. Awesome as a bandana too.
B00L4HZ7FG|5|Dr. Who fans....it's for us.
B00NJVK4YO|4|I am 5'2 and weigh about 105 lbs. I got the petite and it fits perfectly; the hem was right above my knee. I like how you can dress it up or down and add accessories to it. I wore it once with boots and another time with heels and blazer. The only thing is that it took long time for it to arrive. It was four days past its estimated delivery date.
B00NUH3JFS|4|I love this clothes.  It just like the picture.
B00QIEYGBG|5|My girls love these socks and asked for more.
B00CXQFSJ2|5|I am chinese,I love it very much.thanks
B00817E046|2|Would okay for an under shirt.  I just wear them under a long shelve work shirt.  They are pretty thin, if you hold them up to light you can see thur them.
B0017M48MQ|5|Fits as I expected.  Great brand and nice neutral colors.  The pale pink was a nice surprise.  They did a nice job with this bra.  It's old school and very cool to wear.
B00NJJGHK6|1|If your an adult, this will fit you. A 4month old, more like a shirt. Waaay to big. Not a normal size bib at all.
B001BUWZA6|1|Can't really review the product because I never got it - but I can tell you the dealer was awful to deal with.    I bought these pants for a charity fundraiser I do at my University. When I purchased the pants I thought the 'ships in 2-3 days' with express service meant just that. But apparently it takes the dealer 2 weeks just to stock the pants in the first place, which I learned a day or two after making the order. Because of time constraints (when the charity started) I called in to see if they could expedite the order. When I learned I couldn't I was forced to cancel the order... and pay a sizeable restocking fee! Why should I pay to restock the item if they don't even have the item in stock! I tried to explain my situation and they had very little sympathy. Very dissapointing experience.
B00THEZARI|2|It wasn't as expected
B00GYT64IS|2|This blazer was poorly sewn together.  The metal closure fell off when trying it on for the first time.  The material was uneven in length. This was a disappointing purchase.
B00RZXPDP2|5|The cotton is super soft and comfortable. They are better than expected.
B004PBJ2UE|5|I purchase the Bundle 1 Dual-Closure Girdle in a Large and 1 Girdle w/Zipper in an X-large. I bought both just in case I needed a larger size if I didn't fit the smaller one. After three months of wearing the Bellefit occasionally I'm happy to say I've lost over 40lbs of baby weight and can fit into my per-pregancy jeans and clothing! When I returned to work I wore my per-pregnancy scrubs and got many compliments from co-workers that i looked great for having a baby! I believe If I wore it daily I would've lost even more but I'm already happy with my size. You can repurpose the corset as a shaper too! I still wear as a shaper underneath when I wear dresses for weddings. It fits comfortably and hugs my waist in! I couldn't believe it! After given birth (April 8, 2014) I tried on the large but couldn't get into it comfortably. I was so busy with a newborn I forgot to read the instructions on how to wear it. I tried it on while standing!! But the correct way is laying down on the bed! After I slipped into it incorrectly it was pinching me under my armpit fat and boobs. But I knew I had a larger size as backup. When I talked to my OB, she said that I was still quite swollen from the IV fluids and that I should start get back to normal in 2 weeks. So I waited two weeks to try on the large again and I got into it!!! So, if you were a post-partum balloon like me, wait about two weeks after the swelling goes down and try again!! But also have the back up just in case. Customer Service was great and allow for return if unworn/unopen with tags. Just try calling them!!
B00CWACLB2|3|Fine.
B00E8BL344|4|It's good I just got it so it looks good. Nothing's wrong with it.
B009JKIHA2|5|This hat is great! Nice vivid red color (REAL red, not cranberry or maroon, but primary red) went perfect with my suit, got compliments on the hat all night. The fit was also great and you can’t beat amazon’s price on such a quality hat. If you’re looking for a nice red fedora, this is a good choice.
B00JB5U0OG|4|The printing looks great, and my package arrived sooner than expected. The shirt fits really snugly, though.
B00J7LAXSC|5|Good quality, soft cotton that fits nicely on my think and tall son. I ordered a size M, which was supposed to be for 3-4 year old, but it came as a 4-5 years old in the Korean size. However, the fit is good.<br />So cute!
B004TMIHFU|5|Bought this for my son.  Sizing was perfect and materials are very good.
B00AB3LGSQ|1|The material is very cheap feels more like plastic. I think it should be a pAnts not a jeans. Jeans from what I know has cotton, spandex or elastine. This so called jeans had neither fabric texture. It was straight up polyester. I quickly returned it the same day I opened and inspected the package.
B001LK7DYE|5|Item was exactly as described, prompt delivery and well-packaged!
B00CJ6YN06|1|Cheap looking and bad quality
B000OWDON4|2|First off, let me say that the material of this bra is silky which definitely isn't an attribute I want in a sports bra.  It's difficult to take off and on, and the support is minimal.  I am a 36DD, and I get better support in some of my regular bras.  The sizing was large in my opinion, so I should have gone down one band size.  I ended up ordering the \\" Moving Comfort - Juno \\" and I am very happy with that purchase.
B00YIT3B0K|2|This dress is extremely short more like a top. I actually wore it as a top wit blue jeans and no one new the difference. It also has a tight cotton material so it hugs your body.
B00HEB6G9W|2|The fabric that the dress was made out of didn't match the picture or the description. We had to use the dress due to time constraints. We would not recommend this product to others.
B00PR7QAKK|5|Love the T shirt  Everyone that's seen it loves it and ask my where did I buy it  AMAZON Prime!
B00CI99STA|5|Very good quality cardigan.  It it wasn't because it's a little expensive, I would get it in all colors.
B009SVIYBE|5|I bought the blue and the red, Christmas gifts for a co-worker and my daughter.  They are both quite lovely.  I would purchase again.
B007XOR2MU|5|Perfect!
B00CBDH8KO|3|The material is a little thiner, and appears to shrink easily. It shrunk height wise.
B003DI167W|5|This is a lovely pashmina. It feels so soft and it just a beautiful color! I'd definitely order one again.
B00OTIK8FG|1|no
B005GYGG0S|5|I purchased the black one. The quality is good comparing to the price. I would strongly suggest this item to all type of sports. One of my favorite pant that I sometime wear it everywhere. it's very comfy.
B000VK7YS0|4|I like these bras... they are very comfy once they are &#34;broken in&#34; a bit... I will be ordering more... I really wish they would come in more colors... I would order one of each!!
B00KDG9QVK|4|Beautiful t-shirt, nice fit, comfy fabric!
B004SE20M0|4|I've found these boxer briefs to be some of the best fitting for my fruit lol.  They do shrink a little so I'd recommend getting a size larger than you normally would.<br />Would like it if they had more colors but its the fit that's the most important and they do fit well
B00KNTYEUK|4|This cute dress fits well at the shoulders. The belt sits at a slightly dropped waist. The dress washes well and is quite comfortable for my daughter. She is sensitive to scratchy fabrics so it's been nice that she can wear it easily.
B005R9DOJI|3|The gloves are great..they look emerald green in the picture but are really a Teal instead and I can't use them.
B004OVEMBY|5|i am not writing.
B000FGVWLU|4|This didn't fit my head right as it came past my ears. I just bought this hat to wear on a trip to Disney World and it did what I needed it to. It's very cute compared to other baseball caps.
B00CQS9PWI|5|Better than expected, just what I wanted
B00B4NIOPU|5|Good.
B00KC0HW6I|5|My husband loves this brand.  It is getting harder to find sizes other than Small, Medium, Large, etc.  That type sizing does not work for my husband.  Very well made, arrived very fast!
B000FALMCA|4|I love Wrangler stretch jeans, they usually fit me perfect. However, they seem to be very inconsistent in sizing. If they would get that taken care of I would give them a 5 star rating. They could also offer more colors.
B00K0KE0HO|3|Buy this gifts for 4 year old daughter, because she was a little fat than other children, so it looks a little small.
B0085K35TU|5|Perfect for my everyday needs and occasions.  Love the style/design and fit for great comfort.
B00I5KUY1C|5|Perfect fit. So comfy.
B009YFB58I|5|Slim fit and very soft fabric. Very comfortable. I can recommend this polo shirt to anyone looking for a comfortable shirt.
B00920BYAY|5|We ordered 4 dresses for our flower girls and the sizing is tricky. We chose to order based on length rather than the other measurements, and I'm glad we did! 2 of the dresses were size 2 and they fit wonderfully! The 2 larger ones are way too big in the chest and waist because the girls are normal height but not over weight. This is really easy to hide by folding it over in the back and using a pin and the sash to hold it. It also ensures that the dresses will fit them in the future as well. They are absolutely beautiful and the girls love them! I am very glad we took a chance and ordered these dresses! The shipping was really quick, and we didn't have any problems! I would recommend these dresses to any one with a special occasion coming up!
B000IDET6U|4|Good pair of tights, but I have seen better quality spandex.
B00C7BNT7Q|3|Wished the hands weren't ironed on.
B000MXWWA6|4|ok
B0048DKU32|5|Im VERY under endowed, so the pouch part was a little loose,  but I still LOVE this g string! Sexy, and it shows what youve got off!
B0007CKML8|4|Fit great only complaint doesn't easily fit over boots.
B00I5RIT3K|3|cheap cotton, not as good a quality as the last shirt from this brand. disappointed.
B000OQN9CQ|4|Nicely made and the fit is good
B000PVU4JQ|3|Mine was much to small.. and I ordered on the low end of my chest size.
B0053O1KHA|1|I've submitted the thesis and am awaiting the viva.  Do you think the examiners will be impressed and go easy on the difficult questions?  Or do you think they will think I'm not sexy enough and make me rewrite two chapters?  I'm worried that they will hate it so much that I'll be awarded a consolation MPhil.
B00L6B5FLG|4|After reading the other reviews, I decided to get my &#34;true size&#34; when I made my order.  The corset came and seems very well made for it's price.  Unfortunately, it was very large and I actually had an inch to spare when I had tightened it all the way.  I am returning it for a smaller size.
B000COCBI8|5|I haven't tried the cream but the shorts feel great. I ordered my size. By the way if you are not happy with the product you can always return it with money back guarantee. I did have a fear that the shorts won't work and won't fit but I took the risk anyway. Shorts feel awesome. I just wore them for a few days. I can't say I have great results yet since I have't tried them out long enough but I absolutely love them. They fit so well and after wearing them a little bit you feel that you are sweating, that's the best way to get rid of excess water and fat. You can wear them like regular excercise shorts. I think the results would triple if you work out a lot in them. So far I have been walking my dogs in them. That works too.
B001CVRNSS|5|Very nice and good quality.  I bought this for my son's first Holy Communion and I think it will be perfect
B00PMJKE3W|2|These pants have great color and material.  Seems like good quality.  The sizing and length=flawed.  I ordered a Large which is my usual size and it looks like a small.  literally looks like a size 3.  I am tall as well (5'10) and I ordered the long for this reason...they look like capris on me....<br />EXTREMELY SMALL AND SHORT.  These are made for petite women.  But, quality seems great other than size.  Really sad they don't fit....
B00J2LNU7I|4|My wife likes it
B008RYT8FO|5|My little angel looked very cute and she loved having a matching dress on her baby doll. The doll dress did not fit her Bitty Baby but she has another baby doll that is smaller than Bitty Baby and it fit her.
B00J3YI2XQ|5|Soooo pretty. My husband loves the way it looks on me. It was a little clingy but I rubbed it with a dryer sheet and had no problem. LOVE IT.
B008Z8NNF8|3|Bought these for my son to wear at his nautical themed birthday party. The leg warmers are super cute, but the knit is very poor quality. They looked cute for one day, but I don't think they'd hold up for repeated crawling. As for sizing, he is on the larger size for 12 mo... They were snug, but not so tight that I was worried, I do think they would fit a wide variety of sizes.
B007M7FQVW|4|This fits as expected, it is inexpensive, and does keep the rain off.  It is not made for heavy rain play as it is thin, but works well for going from the car to house, etc.
B0091CNJQK|3|The strap broke 30 mins with it on. It was very handsome but it broke jus as soon as we got to the party.
B003ZW1AEU|5|Perfect fit. Lightweight and the material is a great soft moisture control
B0009GAX0C|1|I have the same shirt from Target and Walmart that I've used and they are MUCH nicer quality and thicker than this. For a heavy cotton this shirt is incredibly thin. I wrote to the seller and never received any response in return regarding this matter. Really disappointing.
B000IOIXQQ|5|Fits well, keeps its shape, perfect weight between t-shirt and sweat shirt.  Great on its own or as a layer.
B005FPD29G|5|I have small hands and these fit great! They are warm and have great grip on the palms. They look much nicer in person than in this picture!
B003P0X9EG|4|Comfortable but should hug curves smoothly.  I little baggy.
B00A6Q6OI0|5|I don't generally leave 5 stars, but, this is is everything it says it would be.<br /><br />It's soft, warm, and able to be washed on a standard cycle and put in the dryer without shrinking.<br /><br />Also, (and this is big for me) the sleeves are long enough for my arms.  As a guy who is quite tall and rarely finds things that fit, it's a welcome thing.
B00JPL8A52|4|good
B00GLXH422|5|I bought them for my son who is 7.  They arrived in a timely fashion, they are well made and have stood up to several washings without shrinking or fading.  They fit him perfectly.  I am very happy with the purchase.
B009WQWTM0|5|This is a cute and the quality is also awesome. It fits perfectly and looks just as good after washing.
B000IH8CBO|5|Very nice gloves, just like the flight gloves I wore in the 80's.  Thin and flexible with soft leather on the palms and Nomex backing.  Don't buy these if you want tough work gloves.  They are good driving gloves or for a cool day.
B00IVLPTJ2|4|Just a bit large for my frame
B004ETRJOI|3|My leather wallet got dog-chewed so I needed a replacement, and I wanted something super thin and light. This seemed to fit the bill!<br />The design is cute and original, and the colors match those in the photo.<br />The wallet is made from Tyvek-type material. Very light and thin, and impossible to rip.<br />However, this item lasted a little over a year, and the last few months were frustrating. The wallet is all one piece of folded Tyvek, and the ends kind of tuck into themselves. After 7 or 8 months, the ends kept flapping loose, the wallet itself got very well-worn and loose, to the point that my credit cards were falling out. For $15.00, I expect a wallet to stay in decent shape for more than a few months!<br />So I DID like the wallet, and the design, and it served me well for a few months. But I prefer things that are more durable and will last, and I prefer wallets that don't let my credit cards slide out after a few months' use.<br />I give it 3 stars - it was definitely as described, cool design, thin and light, does not rip, and an interesting novelty. But it's not a good, durable wallet. After it started coming apart I bought a leather wallet for less than $5.00, and that looks like it's going to last me (if I keep it away from the dog!)
B00M7DLZCA|5|Fit as expected.
B00FBI83L4|5|Great lightweight sweater.
B009SSTEPW|2|It runs a little small, but most button up shirts I find do so I had planned accordingly (with a Large). But I was extremely disappointed to find that it was missing a button and didn't come with extra buttons so I could fix it. Sad Day.
B00BD8OXCY|5|it fits absolutely perfectly thank you
B0018QAORY|5|He likes them just fine. But, as we are having very winter weather, he can't use them yet. As the other poster stated, the pants are made for warmer weather.
B000OE624A|4|Nice solid black tie to build a wardrobe around.
B00QH1VVY0|4|I really like the color of my racerback bra, I ordered the pink with black trim. The material is 90% polyester and 10% spandex. The material is breathable and helps me stay dry & cool, also has sun protection which shields me from the sun's rays. It is very comfortable and soft. I use racerback bras to wear with my racerback shirts so as far as a bra goes it gives me good support and also doesn't smush my breast. The stitching on it is straight and clean. The only thing that I didn't like is there were a lot of loose threads that were sticking out and the tag on the inside was cut up and is literally on its last thread and ready to fall off. I did receive this bra at a discount so that I can provide my honest opinion and feedback. I had to give it 4 stars because there shouldn't be a lot of loose threads sticking out. I am pleased though with the support and fit of the bra. I also think it is very stylish.
B00CUJU40A|5|This jacket is a winner - cute color, nice style, good lightweight material.  I can wear it year round.  Very fast delivery too.  I'm a happy camper.
B007R6U992|5|I shirt that made people laugh (even though I'm perfectly serious about my adoration for cows) and has become a personal favorite of mine.
B00EUMI5F6|3|It might have looked better on me if it didn't cling tightly .  I returned it as I couldn't use it the way it was.
B003WNBOQ6|2|I ordered this belt because I just started a job where I have to pass through a metal detector each day and had grown tired of continually removing my belt with metal buckle. I wear pants sized 33 or 34 in the waist, depending on the brand, so obviously I ordered this in size 32-38. You would think that I would have plenty of room to grow in this belt then. Unfortunately that was not the case. The belt had such a small amount of overlap that moving at all caused the velcro to become undone. Also the belt was incredibly stiff and had a backing of velcro the entire length of the belt, so that if it had fit, it would have been destructive to my clothes over time.
B003VHXG4Q|1|So I saw this on Amazon a little while ago, but instead of ordering it, I saw it at a local costume shop.  It looks cute and that's what I liked about it.  Anyhow, I tried it on, shirt and skirt were okay.... shirt a little see through though.  I start a load of wash and washed it correctly.  Though when I took it out, the \\"corset\\" fell apart.  I found pieces of \\"stuffing\\" in the form of foam. Irritated!  Sadly, there is a no returns in this store that I bought it in, so there goes my money!  I would defiantly NOT buy it.
B00CV9F6MA|5|I am not a muscular man, I am not a trim man, I am not a large man. For me, it is essential that a medium shirt lay properly across my mediocre physique. For years, we mediums have had 'oversized tees' and other nonsense as our only option, unless we wanted to resemble an overstuffed sausage. This shirt actually fits nicely. It is snug on the top of the chest and doesn't highlight my softer areas. The black color the choice of material are very flattering. And as a Trekkie, I could not resist the insignia. Thank goodness that movie was so hated so I could get this for like ten bucks!
B00CDILH22|5|This costume is great!  It's an awesome color, detachable feathers are nice.  My daughter was almost 10 months (20 lbs) when she wore a size small, and it fit perfectly.
B002LSI312|5|These pants fit perfect, love them!!
B008XCNUKY|3|They aren't as form fitting as my previous leather gloves and not as nice, but those were Armani, you get what you pay for. Definitely nice for the price.
B00FBD2H0W|5|Socks are socks.
B00RCUBU5U|2|I checked the sizing chart before considering buying these thinking they would fit my 39-40 inch waist and 47 inch hips. They are much too big for my waist and the drawstring does not help matters any. They fit lose through the seat and thighs. Would be great for a fuller figure, but not for my curves
B00I5NJ9GK|2|Had to return for a size down.
B00JAWV1IO|5|Fit was good
B00MF9MWYQ|5|Best freaking mittens I've ever owned. Super warm and super soft. Haven't even had snow leak through.
B00297VJOI|4|Unfortunately, I then had belly reduction surgery (successful) and now I don't use it anymore. But it did fit me well as I was at the time, and it is attractive and well made.
B0041DS5FY|4|I usually use the hat when it is raining to cover my head. I can keep it in my bag and it won't wrinkle of crumple.
B00I1ANZD0|5|Shirt fits well and seems to be well made.  The colors were perfect for the wedding we attended.
B00421BL2E|1|I bought it to match with the Men's solid black Jacket that i bought last week. The fitment is perfect, but the color doesn't match. This is a different shade of black. Never thought the same brand solid black Jacket and pant would be different shades of black...disappointing..will be returning it..
B00K5B9RHG|5|Lightweight comfortable & I am happy with this purchase
B00FF85A3E|5|The size chart is very accurate with these shorts. Great comfort and good quality. If you work out with your quads a-lot you might want to go a size up like I did. So if your in between a large and X-large. I went with X-large and they fit perfectly.
B0085VGQMW|5|Ordered 6 pairs of these for my husband. They run a tad large, and I had to repair a pocket on one pair, but otherwise he says they are soft and comfortable, and they're holding up well after many washings. How's that for a run-on sentence?
B00C5TOTHY|5|Fits and looks great!
B00OUCQNXC|5|Beautiful dress for such a good price!  Perfect for a 20's themed party!
B00NNC59IK|5|Is this long/big enough to wear as a slouchy beanie?
B00GJO576S|5|Super
B007VDFERS|3|I confirmed with Hanes that these are not mid-rise briefs, but are full-rise. They said they do not make the comfort blend in mid-rise.
B0028EC72U|5|I'm very happy with this purchase, you can't go wrong with Columbia coats and rain gear.
B00DQEPDVS|4|This dress is cute but runs a size large
B00SA3RB9C|1|Bought this for St. Patty's Day.  Washed once, inside-out, on the gentle cycle, and the print started coming off.  Junk.
B00E5RMEOE|5|Excellent buy.
B00J8NLQJO|5|I love it . It feels good,  looks good . And it came very fast in the mail. Im very happy.
B00AY8M3JO|5|Love the light material.  Daughter wanted to wear her footie pajamas in the summer, but we live in Texas so too hot for the fleece ones.... These work great and she loves them!  Wish more design options.
B0094G8RKQ|5|I was a little concerned that this would fit too small but it is awesome. I am 5'10&#34; 170 lbs and the large fits exactly like the photo.
B002BCKMKI|5|This tie is perfect for business travel.  It is elegant, but because it is made of polyester instead of silk, spots can be removed.  My husband takes it on all his business trips.
B004HZYEYW|5|My daughter loves it -- perfect size for toddler/pre school child for air line travel.  Straps are adjustable which was a requirement for me.
B000ZHFGGQ|1|I am normally a size 16/18. I did not feel these were plus size. I am tall, but these still barely went over my knee. I was highly disappointed.
B00IJ32XWS|5|Fit and quality excellent, perfect bikini for a slim 50yr. Mum.I bought the matching strapless top, which has a strap and it fits well with padding support inside. love it! it is modest but sexy.
B00HVNZZIQ|2|only wore once didn't like not good quality
B001JBNDLM|3|Maybe my legs are too thin - my johnson keeps falling out thru the elastic around the legs after being worn for a  few hours. Other than that, I'm happy.
B00HJTKVX6|1|Useless. Waist of money.
B00M7P0LS2|5|I bought this for my very slim 20-year-old son.  He loves wearing it over a t-shirt.  It is definitely a &#34;slim fit&#34;.  My son is in-between Small and Medium and this shirt fits him perfectly.
B00BNQRL7U|5|I brought two for our trip to disney. Very well made , durable, and comfortable to wear all day and as a carry on bag
B0083I7CAC|3|The shirt is very bright and my daughter loved it, even though I recieved a size medium and I ordered a size large. Luckily she could still wear it-just hope it doesn't shrink.
B00S1IPNGO|5|Nice Quality Shirt.  Color was great, screen printing was great and fast shipping!
B001THFW5Q|5|For starters, I'm a big guinness fan. I've had a hard time finding a nice guinness hat, until i found this hat. It's made very well, and it fits like a glove. I love that it's pre-weathered and it's also original Guinness merchandise. I love this hat!
B00NQEREL0|4|Nice hat. I bought 2 hats; one for me and one for my wife..
B003AC4MKE|5|Bought this for my honeymoon. It fits a little looser than the other I bought in the same size, but it does fit. Will be nice for those post-sun times when I don't want something too form fitting. I'm in that gray area between a 10 and a 12, and the large fits loose.
B002VX1MYM|5|Very cute. Not sexy but very cute. Bought the recommended complementary costume items to go with the dress. Total hit.
B00GTCMODE|5|As a plus size mum, finding outfits that shapes my curves evenly is like a war. This dress fits well, a confidence booster and above all of a high quality fabric. I say you will get the right value for your money here.
B0071U94OK|4|So cute and soft!  I wish we would have bought a size larger since our baby grew out of it within weeks of purchase!  Definitely runs small!
B005KC8NH0|5|Perfect for my 8 month old without being too tight. I have a hard time finding ones in a good size and these are great. They come in a variety of colors and are soft. The only headbands I buy now.
B00OHZRM14|3|very nice and snug
B0055QNLR8|5|My husband  has a very painful knee due to a very physically strenuous job.  He has tried every type knee brace on the market & is so pleased with the Incrediwear Knee Brace, that he said he can finally stop searching for the perfect one !!
B00KMDB1OE|1|The brim was huge and looked more like a women's hat  imo
B00AO5NVEI|5|wow arrived early, what a big surprise, we are going out saturday night so she can wear it afterward, so excited to see her in it
B00BJSSQTO|5|Super cute!
B00COG24DY|4|Overall its ok, as expected, quality is good, personally I think that the skirt is a little shorter than expected.
B002DZIMSM|2|It is nothing like the picture.  It is made of cloth.  The boots are terrible.  You will  have to get more Velcro it make them fit the way you want them to fit.  The hat is cloth so it does not stand up on its own.  I kept it because my grand daughter was here visiting and we did  not have time to send it back.
B009BHE7HU|3|My friends get laughs from this shirt. The silk screen is good quality. After a few months it will shrink, even if you wash on cold.
B0048KUCLU|1|I like the bra and how it fits but I've only worn it two or three times and the underwire is already coming out. Super disappointed with this products durability, especially since it fit me so well.
B007M6161C|1|Returned them.
B00GYTJWX2|4|Color and size is as expected, though it came in very wrinkly. There's cheap material from the inside but it doesn't matter 'cuz the outside is great.
B00192WU42|4|I am using a test pair of these to see if they last well, and so far, they make the cut. They fit well and launder well, and appear to be made quite well. They are not too thin, as a few other reviewers say. I believe that thin comment comes from the fact that there is no flap in the front of these.
B007CVKCS0|5|The dress arrived today and I tried it on and am ecstatic!  I am 5'5&#34;, 142 lbs, 38 C and it fits like a dream.  I ordered an 8 and because it is stretchy, it fits everywhere and is form fitting through the waist.  It is short and I have some concerns about wearing it dancing (which is why I purchased it) but with white silky underwear, I think it will be fine.  I will wear it with a black lace shrug as my upper arms are not as pretty as I'd like. The shrug works perfectly with it.  I'll add a pair of black strappy heels and dance the night away.  I do enjoy clothing that has an unusual cut and the handkerchief hem on this, cut on a slant is flirty and fun.  The fabric is fine and comfortable and so for the price I highly recommend it.  I'm not sure how long it will hold up but I'll enjoy every second in the meantime.
B00BCF1MC2|4|This was very cute, it fit well.  My daughter really liked it.  I would purchase this brand again. Price was great too!
B001EOINXC|5|I was expecting a simple gold colored wrap to go with a rather basic dress. This however is almost too fancy for it! It has shiny metallic gold filament in with the tread that gives it an elegant look. So the bad news is it is too nice for the dress I wanted it for, the good news is it's gorgeous & well worth the price paid!
B00AENBZK2|5|These are a warm heavy sock. A little much to fit inside my boots. I wear them around the house with slippers. Very nice fit and quality.
B0029NAENE|2|I loved this dress but unfortunately it was WAY too big! I ordered a size medium and when it came the package said Medium size 10-14. Since when is a medium that big? I am a 6/8 so this costume did not work out. It was very cute though if it had fit correctly. I did not return because it was too big a hassle and I will just donate. Be careful on the sizing of this though if you order!
B00NASVQI4|5|As good as I expected! Comfortable and easy to wear. I love 7 for all mankind!
B00OH6Y31U|5|Have to wear sling soon and hope this works better than sleeves and keeps me warm.
B00WRVQCP2|3|Beautiful vest but too small.  XL does not fit when the waist is 42&#34;.
B00DRG3VZK|5|I am 5'7&#34; and 125 lbs and the medium size was perfect for me.
B00JM8MWRK|5|Great socks.
B00B6EA60S|4|Greart
B002ETC05S|4|This is the first cover I purchased and for the most part is is great.  Slim, a pretty shade of blue, no imperfections, no issues putting my Kindle in nor taking it out.  My only issue is that the power switch is exposed and it turns on in my purse.  I have tried different things to cover the hole, blue duct tape works best!  It has become my at-home cover, I will use the one I made myself for travel.
B009QA9Q5K|5|excelente producto vendedor muy responsable y el empaque muy bien preparado excelente producto vendedor muy responsable y el empaque muy bien preparado
B0054RTKLO|5|The tie came beautifully packaged, excellent quality.....however, I had to return it because the white did not match the white of my sons communion suit.
B00IIJFBAO|4|I'm 5'1 125 it fit well. Ok quality fabric. Looked sexy
B003VFVSOI|4|We bought this Tee as a birthday gift for a very politically active friend. He Loved it! Barely takes it off (except for washing) - thinking about getting him a second shirt!
B00D4KWJFC|5|My granddaughter loves her new flower outfit.  perfect for the weather right now. easy care for mommy as well.  Just right
B009MYM4HM|5|&#34;great item it arrived on time and as described in the description, fit perfectly like i expected wish it came in lace material,it did its job and lifted my butt, and made my pants and dresses look amazing, i will definitely order from this seller and highly recommend.&#34;
B0091EUSU8|5|I have various jackets, but needed one for cool days and chilly nights, preferably water resistant.  This fit the bill perfectly.
B007X602VG|5|LOVE THE FABRIC AND THE FIT IS VERY GOOD. TRUE TO SIZE. I WEAR THESE ON WEEKENDS. WILL ORDER MORE.
B0040ZB2YY|1|This product sucked. It was hard as a rock.
B004OWUK5U|5|Good  and hot
B007A2IVA2|4|The T shirt came on time but it's a tad too big for me even after checking the size chart. The quality is great though. I've ordered more :)
B008USYKKU|5|It's a nice wallet, has the exact space for everything, ID card, money and stuff. I'd recommend this, it's made in a cool material.
B007X4DLM0|2|OK, for the money I guess.  It seemed a little short and skimpy even though I ordered a size up.  I won't reorder.
B00F10SDJE|5|Fit great
B0091SBOS4|5|Heard my fiancee mention how much he would love a onezie.  He laughed out loud when he opened this gift.
B00CZD7VFW|2|Very disappointed. My daughter absolutely loved this shirt (as she is well known for doing this). However after one wash it shrank and now doesn't cover her belly. I would say order a size larger than you really need.
B00B6DIG60|5|Mud pie is always a quality product. Would recommend hand washing in cold water to prevent shrinking. Runs small, I buy my 2 year old a 3T.
B007I4HHOI|5|Wolf starts with the letter w. W is the 28th letter of the alphabet and the moon has 28 days in its cycle - there are three wolves and one moon 3+1=4 so 28+4=32  add those 3+2=5 and that means you will get pregnant by wearing get this shirt
B005H3IX7M|4|I like this little purse.  It looked just like the picture and the leather is soft.  It has just enough room.
B00NBSQCZU|5|I love these and was glad to be able to get them --as I cannot seem to find them in stores I shop at.  Thanks!
B000KBCQOM|5|Excellent....just what was advertised.
B00ANS7WQO|5|This is such a great looking bag! Reading the reviews here, people have been saying they're getting off-color bags and I agree, to an extent. Its slightly darker than the pictures indicate, but still a really nice shade of brown. I'm only carrying a 13 in. chromebook and a case for my headphones and the bag doesn't look bloated or is bulging.<br /><br />Also, I'm 5'11&#34; and some reviewers have said that the strap is too short for them, but that wasn't the case for me. It seems long enough for someone 6'+, since I have it shortened a bit and it fits perfectly.<br /><br />I feel like this bag is a great deal, so if you're comparing it to the other leather bags here on amazon, I'll say go for this one!
B00T1VHB10|5|My boyfriend is a die hard Lebron FAN ! So I purchased this shirt and he loved it. He is about 5'9-5'10 Medium build and it fits perfectly.
B00EKS16PQ|5|Great! Fits perfectly... Like them a lot! Great to wear! Nice! Nice! Happy I got them! Very pleased.. Wear them well! I hate the part of writing something.
B00EXCQ4O2|5|AWESOME
B00E3U3HYE|3|Size's run too small I got the size from one of my wife's other dresses.
B004S9G6TS|5|This was a very beautiful product and had arrived on time as expected.  Although I fell in love at first sight with this top it did not fit me.  In retrospect being a 38D I am not sure why I bought a top with a \\"one size fits all\\" cup, but it had seemed like a good idea at the time.  I ended up giving it to my friend for my birthday who is a 28A, which is too small for the top, but she loves it to death!  I would definitely recommend buying this top if you are roughly a 32-34 B/C because it is absolutely gorgeous!
B00A3Q8ST6|4|Not what I thought. It will do great for the occasion the fit is GREAt.. But it was way too long,I shoulda gotten the short version. I'm 5 ft 4 inches, 200 lbs.i got size 16' and what<br />I did was cut the bottom ruffle since it was Dragging on the floor.it does look kinda cheap.. Not too bad.but I wish I should have gotten a different dress that looked less flea market like lol. It will do, see what comments I get
B00BR9W8JO|5|Holds pins like nothing else out there. I highly recommend it.
B00IFQV6JA|4|Fit as expected, nice colors except tey cringe together when put in the wash
B00O9SWG38|1|Eh..cheap and the color combo was so so. Didn't get the scarf they showed on line.. Got something different. If I could I'd give it a minus star.
B00NYAW5I8|5|Love it, looks super cute on my girlfriend... Even better when she's taking it off!!! Am I right fellas?!!! Haha but no seriously great product my girlfriend loves it and if you're into Batman it's a great way to spice things up
B00AF30JXU|2|So I got this leggings because i am going out of the country to Peru and its going to be cold so as shown on the pic, I thought the inside of the leggings were going to be furry like that but THEY WERE NOT. they are really THIN and even though they are not elastic like meterial they do look nice on maybe to wear inside the house or under jeans if not you'll freeze lol. you can wear them if it's just a cool day but not a COLD day. they are cute though and for the price its fair enough. but i was a bit disappointed it wasn't furry inside. btw i got two (the other in black and white and ill be leaving the same comment on that 1 too)
B00OV1O6UO|5|Thank you, Amazon! Finally I have a dress that I will be proud to wear to a wedding, after trying three times to order others and returning them. This is beautiful, it came in a box, not a bag, and was ready to wear. Can't tell you just how much I like this dress. When I saw it modeled above the knee, I realized that I needed not to order petite as I always have, but a misses size, and the length for me at my age is just right, below the knee. It's not too heavy to wear in July and the long sheer jacket covers a multitude of sin!
B00FU8Z0IO|5|Our daughter loves One Direction and this beanie! It's a great material and fit for her head. The colors are nice too.
B0025Z1XBS|2|This isn't a good pajamas item. Zips up to the top instead of top to bottom so zipper would pinch chin. Elastic around the ankle is too tight for a sleeper.
B000F6SSJY|5|My mother was very pleased with the quality and colors of her gift of handkerchieves.  She said she may order some more herself.
B000VEN6VA|5|The iron on patch worked perfectly for what I was using it for. We had a 50's theme party to attend, I found a cardigan at my local thrift store. The sweater had a logo on it, I ironed the patch over the logo and it looked great.
B00FC47Q4M|5|I have probems with plus size tops being too small, but this one fit perfect.  I ordered a 2X and it delivered.
B004E8NF56|4|As a casual shirt, this shirt does what it is supposed to do: fit well, and be comfortable.  It fits like most Polo/golf shirts, but is higher in comfort than many.    Additionally, the Diamond pattern looks good in person, and makes it stand out from other polos.  I've laundried the shirt a few times with no fuss or hassles.
B003X0G09O|5|Best wallet I've had! Well built. Warning though, it created a hole in my dress pants because I mistakenly put it in my back pocket! Front pocket from there on in, and no problems since!
B00HFF5VF2|4|Nice coat!
B00A74I3Q2|5|Excellent choice. Don't hesitate in buying this ones.
B002XF9P3S|3|Had I reviewed this when I originally purchased it, it would only have garnered the single mandatory star. Like the others, I received the set in a flimsy plastic bag, but that wasn't even the problem. The problem was that it REEKED of petroleum products. Like straight-up oil! It was AWFUL! I emailed the company back and forth a couple times and they were supposed to send me a pre-paid mailer to return it. The mailer never came and customer service stopped responding to my emails. I would have just washed them to see if I could get the odor out, but they are dry clean only. So the whole shebang was set into a corner and mostly forgotten.<br /><br />Fast forward to about a month ago when the package was rediscovered. I pulled the items out and the smell had completely dissipated. I have been using them ever since and have been quite pleased. So take from that what you will.
B0061I2NW8|5|My wife states that these gloves are: Very warm, sturdy yet flexible. She uses them to stack fire wood with me.
B00PN60VQY|5|Written by my wife: &#34;I LOVE THIS DRESS!!!! It's my new favorite. I feel so stylish and feminine! If I could wear it to church every week, I would!&#34;
B00BG3MZB2|5|These are so cute and soft and the fit is good for my just turned 5 year old (average size) grandson. I wanted them to be a bit loose but not baggy and they are perfect. They are well made and the price was excellent as well!
B00CF0Y03G|5|Loved this mask! The quality of the paintwork was excellent and looked like authentic cracked porcelain. Mask had a good weight to  it. and the fit was as expected. It was a little warm and cause me to sweat a bit more than expected but that what happens when you wear a piece of plastic on your face. Will definitely be wearing again! Until then it will sit on my shelf as decoration because it really is a beautiful piece.
B00JSJLSXW|5|Rave reviews for the gloves!
B00K7D2XQY|5|good！
B00AT0N5RG|4|Size is small in compareison  to the toy ones they used to sell but I like this better it's forms to u.
B00DE2DMM4|1|it is too large, i don´t like
B00AYYGZT2|4|This makes the ultimate lounge around the house outfit!  It is a bit too skimpy to wear out in public; but my husband loves it when I wear this set and a few other Hello Kitty short outfits and Chemises to lounge around the house....go figure!!  I found it to me a tad bit smaller than other reviews led me to believe and this was the only reason it got 4 out of 5 stars, instead of 5 of 5!  Otherwise, It is awesome and I adore it...I have actually just purchased some additional  sets!  Thanks to those Hello Kitty Vendors of Women's Clothing; as it is hard to find here in middle VA!!
B004R1NTSI|5|I love the fabric and durability, no piling after many washes and no shrinkage. This top is gathered at the chest line and drapes from there into a flowy a-line shape. Lovely with jeans and a long necklace or scarf. I will definitely be getting more of these- I am short and curvy, the large fit well but the xlarge is longer and more drapy so I wear the large with jeans and the xl with leggings for a little more coverage. It's good to wear a cardigan or open top over this so you don't get that maternity look. Hope this helps!
B00LNF1ZLY|5|👍
B0072ICFUG|5|Fits perfectly
B00ACIFP5K|5|great price!
B00ID1Q3IQ|4|I do like this shirt, but I will tell you I am a woman about 130 lbs and I bought a large and it fits perfect. The material was thinner than I expected, but it is a nice layering shirt. Be careful to consider the sizing before you order.
B00KD22I3W|1|There's no place where this should be considered an extra large. I ordered an xl and got what seems to be somewhere between a small and medium. however, it fit my niece well... hope she enjoys it.
B00FARFKTE|3|This shirt runs very small! I am 5'4, 120 lbs and usually a size small. After reading comments, I ordered a size large. It is still skin tight. Too immodest to wear alone but ok under a jacket. I think its actually a junior cut as the shoulders are narrow too. Material is nice and soft.
B000WJHEUS|5|Bought these as part of a pioneer costume. Much better quality than I had expected. They worked great on my 8 year old son and are easily adjustable.
B00LIRYKD2|5|I got this for my son.He loves it the fit and look is really good.Very well made.
B00DC0U8N4|4|I love this brand of bras! This particular one is a bit smaller than I expected.  It does have nice lift and I really like the breathable material.
B00UZGKT1O|5|This shirt is of really good quality, fits as expected and feels good on my skin. Would purchase more.
B00CMAIGD4|2|The shirt fit fine. I was just disappointed about the iron on decal. I was hoping it was going to be a silk screen application. The iron on makes the shirt look cheap and it won't hold up
B007RFKE7A|5|Perfect height for workout sneakers and they are very comfortable because they are thick and cushy.
B00ACIFCJE|5|I practically live in these tanks. This particular item actually has &#34;ComfortSoft&#34; written on the top and the tanks are indeed soft. It is says &#34;100% ring spun&#34; which is an elegant touch for a basic tank. Just as an FYI (&#34;Ringspun cottons are smoother and stronger. They've been through a spinning process that softens and straightens each fiber. Another step up in quality is combed ringspun cotton, which is even more refined. After the cotton fibers have been spun, they're combed to remove any impurities or imperfect strands)&#34;<br /><br />I indicated the &#34;fit was as expected&#34; though I's say they are slightly on the slim side but luckily they are preshrunk so It. I am a US women's size 6  with about a 36 inch chest and very broad shoulders and the men's small is a perfect fit with no straps showing or sometimes just barely.
B00H58UDYI|2|The sizes have to lie, as what I normally wear is a 40D. This thing tried to suffocate me.
B009K9IM0W|5|My husband love's them =) We plan to buy more. They made a perfect Christmas gift. They are terrific! Fantastic!
B00GTKVTPK|4|great
B00L3MEP50|5|These sunglasses are really nice and very sturdy. I love the heart adornment, it makes them very feminine.
B000HE9PXC|5|BUEN DIA TODO MUY BIEN COMO LO ESPERABA LA ENTREGA FUE A TIEMPO Y LOS PANTALONES SON DE MUY BUENA CALIDAD . GRACIAS
B00108GW0S|5|This is the only style money clip my husband will use. Wallets are bulky and sitting on them hurts after a while. These will fit nicely in your front pocket. Will hold identification and credit cards as well as shield just how much cash you are carrying from view.
B00ITJV4AO|1|I'm really disappointed about the quality and the fabric of the dress, it wasn't what I expected at all, in the pictures it seems to be a different type of dress, it is not an elegant dress and the quality of the fabric is very different form what the picture shows. In fact I want to return the dress but I don't know how to do it, if some one could help me doing this I will appreciate it.
B00E8A44W8|3|In ordering this there was no way to know what size was available and was given no way to easily choose a size. I wish I had been able to because when it came it was everything I'd wanted except for the size.
B006ZS94GM|4|i purchased this as a step up from jeans and the work just fine.  The size seems fit properly.  I had to purchase long since they were out of regular.  Great for casual wear with a polo.
B0099AXW70|2|light weight material & the XXL is really more like L
B00VFTTJVQ|5|Perfect
B00GTB0LUS|1|To big for me
B0037TIDY6|5|Got this backpack for my daughter, a turtle lover. She gets complements everywhere she goes. Sturdy, well built, and just goofy enough to be cool.
B006CQ9UO8|5|Perfect for my boy
B0015VDM7Q|5|Great for running, especially in hot weather.  These Balega socks have cushioning in all the right places but very thin, vented fabric on top to keep things cool and ventilated.  They are cotton but VERY soft and extremely comfortable.  Well worth the slightly steep price!
B00FSDWC6O|3|My son loved his elmo shirt  from santa.... but there were black dots all in the eyes and nose. I am not sure if it is ink or mold? He hasn't wore it yet because of this.. other wise the shirt is really cute. :)
B00LBCFEIO|1|Too short - will return. Wanted to like it -  Love the material
B00JRTPPF0|4|me gustaron quiero comprar en algun otro momento otros iguales
B008M7DDS4|5|I love this scarf! For the price it is much better than I expected! Just the right amount of sparkle to still be able to wear it to the office without looking like I'm on my way to a nightclub! Just the right length & the colors are deep & rich and will go with many colors! Go buy one if you haven't already!
B005542WPM|5|I purchased this as a gift for my 2 yr old niece and she loves it!  Very soft fabric and just adorable :)
B009I51ZGQ|4|I gave this shirt to my son and I have heard neither great acclaim nor any disappointment, so I am assuming that he likes it.
B003ZYDPWS|2|The fabric does not feel soft to the touch in anyway. It has a huge tag that will irritate you if you don't cut it out. I could have gotten same quality at the Dollar General for a much cheaper price.
B000EB7VWK|5|husband loves it as is shades the sun for him down here in Arizona.  looking to buy another longer one.  thanks so much
B0051D4K3O|3|I ordered this item online because I am very familiar with Lee Jeans. I know the fit and quality. I expected the same thing, but was disappointed to discover that this was a lighter-weight fabric, not the same as the heavy denim I was used to. I haven't worn them many times or washed them yet; I'm unsure they will hold up to wear the same as the jeans I had before. The description should notify purchasers about the fabric switch.
B00KDGK1KK|5|True to size, great feel of material, slimming, and comfortable.
B00BOEMFHW|4|Needed something light for resort wear evening out.
B00C5R29XM|5|My granddaughter was a bit hit wearing her new pair of  Richie House blue, polka dot and lace shorts.  They fit perfectly and are very stylist.  I love the quality fabric, the price and the prompt delivery of this very fine clothing.
B0006I7I2O|5|fit wonderfully.
B006MHW684|5|Comfy and cute
B002A9JX84|5|They fit a tiny bit small, maybe I just need to loose 10 pounds... who knows.. My other pants which are same size fit me fine.<br /><br />I am going to keep them and make a goal to loose a tiny bit a weight because I like them a lot. I may order more.
B00CZ50G9S|5|This is a really cute hat for the beach and the tie at the bottom helps me keep it on my son, so I don't have to worry about his head getting burned. It's a really cute design too!
B00MQCQHKW|1|Very bad don't buy it.
B00BV2UN3K|5|My son wanted a PEA coat. He is in college and likes to look good for the ladies. The minute he put this on I started calling him GQ. He looked so good in this coat. Ok, that's the plus part. The down side is that it collects every single bit of lint and everything shows on the color we got which was black. It is also a wool blend and with him being in college I know it's never getting dry cleaned unless he's home. I purchased a water proofing spray and it repelled the water enough to keep him dry, made it so you can take a damp clothe to the fabric and we keep the coat in a bag while it's sitting on the hanger on those occasions he comes home. It fits a little looser than American cut coats, but as I told my son, you don't want a tight jacket when you have on a shirt and tie. He loves this coat and I would buy it again in a second
B004VO2SEC|3|i thought they were cotton. but they seem to some artificial polyester and very light at that. The design is excellent, if only the material used matched it
B008HCMRKE|4|Like another reviewer said, Buying on the internet is always a gamble. But this pair is definitely a bingo.<br /><br />They look fantastic. They feel great.<br /><br />Pros: They're not the warmest, but my hands don't get cold even when spending 30-40 minutes cleaning off cars in a blizzard.<br />They fit fantastically and don't hinder mobility. They haven't shrunk or had any damage from salt or snow.<br />They're durable. I put two or three small cuts on them with a knife, and after extensive use the cuts didn't get any larger or compromise any of the quality.<br /><br />Cons: The buttons are rigid and hold well, but come undone pretty easily with a swiping motion. I bought the gloves for the cold weather and when cleaning a foot of snow off a car, the buttons occasionally get opened, and since the gloves only reach to the end of the wrist, I often get snow on my wrists and it's pretty cold. But this is no big deal when the rest of my hand is warm.<br /><br />One other con is that I don't have any more pairs. These are fantastic gloves, and should I need another pair, they're inexpensive and easily replaced. The winter is easing up and the gloves held well; I hope to see them last next years winter.
B000IUSJF0|3|Bought this product as part of a Halloween costume and ended up winning first place in a contest because of how real they looked. My only issue with them is that they seem to start coming unraveled after only a couple uses.  Be warned: Does not include the hat or beard depicted in the picture.  It is strictly the Payis (curly sideburns).
B002GXDSK8|5|If you can remember the need for spindle adapters, you weren't at Woodstock. Wait, that's not how it goes. Either way, this is a very nicely polished replica of the classic spindle adapters needed to play 45 RPM singles on many record players.
B0050ALUSQ|3|The costume is super cute but too small, and I even ordered a size larger based on the reviews. I am not an XL anything but we'll see how the next one I ordered fits when it arrives.
B000KD44G8|5|These socks are just great, exactly like the ones we used to be able to find in store.  Thanks so much!
B00M21120C|1|Did not look a thing like the photo. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!
B0071YY6EE|1|it was all not working right
B00743P7FO|4|will be trying them hope they help his legs.
B00PCZUAS0|5|I've been looking for these for a long time. Perfect fit. I'm 5-4 28&#34; waist they fit true to size I ordered smalls. Will order more.
B00F9RNZ24|5|Love all three of them, even though this one (navy) is somewhat shorter than the rest. They are cool and comfortable.and can wear them all year round.
B005WQ7UF0|2|It doesn't fit,  is ugly to dress. some misshapen.  The fabric is not as cotton is a horrible silk
B0072D9S4M|5|I purchased a size larger than what I wear so I can wear a long sleeve shirt under it in the winter. I was just the right size.
B00NGI011G|2|I am 5'2 115 lbs and ordered a small. The shirt's size fits fine. It's just that it is too short. It is no where as long as what is pictured. So, I had to purchase a pair of high-wasted black mini shorts to wear with this instead of the hip hugging pair that I originally had to wear with these.
B00KU2COIY|2|It looks cheap
B005JPNYG8|1|Not very expensive and its evident immediately. The spring keeping the clip closed is very weak. My tie clip fell off on my 200 yard walk to work. I figured it wasn't worth looking for. If you are a police, security, or other public service personnel you probably need a tie clip that can withstand more than a 200 yard walk on a barely windy day.
B006HFJA12|5|Great bag for students, plenty of room in the bag and the straps are comfortable on your shoulders even as the load gets heavier. Also has more than enough pockets to suit most needs.
B00N1IEVVC|4|This was nice
B00F4DRHT0|5|I got this scarf for it's looks, it looked and is vary warm and stylish, as everything i have gotten from this seller it is of great quality,and it was sent out to me straight away,i will be telling my friends about this seller.
B004ZJKCQY|1|bad product, mao ye ye hui lu tou
B00JEJS1WC|2|The waste band is a little scratchy
B004ZZNYXQ|4|I bought this bath robe for my father and while I've only seen him wear it a total of 1 time, it seems a bit larger than I would expect. Otherwise, it seems to be pretty well made
B00CIPJV4Q|5|This looked surprisingly nice when I put it on. It really stands out. It's definitely not the most sturdy construction but probably has at least a few wears in it. Fun piece for a great price.
B00IL73VV4|1|I have a 33&#34; waist and the Large was too small.  Disappointed.
B007YXN9LI|4|Not much to say...it fits well, and the print is good.  No surprises here.<br /><br />It does get a lot of smiles.
B00M1MPF32|1|I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN IT
B00TK7NQHI|4|Bought in two sizes both are exactly what I expected. Love them
B00HWFBDC0|4|It fits fine around the midsection and bust, but the racerback straps are a bit loose, which is strange since the rest is fine. Doesn't affect it too badly, but keeps it from being 5 star. Very comfortable and easy to run in.<br />The large fits fine on me (other than the aforementioned issue), and I typically wear a women's large.
B002FCB24E|4|The suit fit as expected however boot covers are a little snug around the calf. Overall it is a great buy
B00IDALLSE|5|Stunning hat. Fit perfect
B007CFJUUM|5|Love the thickness...they stay on and fit perfectly.. Gold toe is always a superior quality sock.  I am hoping they wear well..too soon to tell.
B011AFF3LO|5|Belt is perfect color as pants
B00A6UXEQG|5|My son just turned eight and he loves LEGO, especially the Ninjago series of toys.<br />We got him this shirt for his birthday.  Do I really need to tell you he loves it? Of course he loves it.<br />It is a nice quality shirt with a great bold graphic, if I was eight I'd want one too.<br /><br />I ordered this shirt in a Small which is a 6/7.<br />If I had to say how it runs I would say it's on the generous side of 7 but not too big.<br />It fits and we are very happy with the shirt.
B00E346CJM|5|I purchased this bottom to wear with the matching top and it is great! It hugs in all the right places and keeps everything in place. It goes right above my bellow button. I am 5' 0&#34; and weigh 101 lbs. Great buy!
B00IDWNUQS|4|I mainly got this so I can go to beach and surf and boogie board without putting on sunscreen all day.  I usually put a single application of sunsreen on just to be safe but i have skipped it entirely and havent gotten any sun thru this thing.  it does fit tight, like  wetsuit tight, so not ideal for fishing, etc.
B00JLXLBCI|5|vn
B009YQ6SXE|5|Quick shipment, and well made wig!  Not cheap.  It was a perfect compliment to my daughter's anime costume!  Highly Recommend
B000VK7PCU|5|It is hard to find a nice coat with a hood that is not too casual.  I had originally purchased this coat at Macy's.  The original price was $400 and I bought it on sale for $180 - which I thought was a good deal.  Out of curiosity I was trying to find the coat on the internet.  I was really surpised when it came up on Amazon for $119.99. I was skeptical because there was not a lot of information however I did find the item number and it matched the coat I bought.  Now I am not a returner or a price adjuster person generally but in this case that is a big difference and on Amazon they said the original price was $250.  Ithe next day I ordered the coat.  It had been reduced by another $10. $99.99 and the shipping was free.  I took the other coat back first though and printed the page from Amazon thinking, without much hope, that Macy's would do a price adjustment - I think the young sales clerk wanted to but she could not match the internet price - so back it went.  When I got the coat I was delighted.  It was the same in everyway.  It is generously sized and very soft and luxurious.  I hadn't really shopped on Amazon before.  I thought they were books and music.  Before a bigger buy I always check here first.
B004GG3M9U|5|Always buy these for my husband. Perfect fit and comfortable.
B00JBHLOXA|5|Was impressed by overall craftsmanship. Great deal, too.
B002K8PC76|4|I brought for my 3 months old safe for eye ,belt help stay on eyes cover full eye and look cool now we don't have worry for sunlight
B000KRVC32|5|I am extremely happy at the purchase I made of this item.  It is everything it said it was and more.  I feel no one should be without one.  The next thing I need is the hat due to the fact my stetson don't quite fit with this product.
B00N588UJ2|5|Really soft and high quality, Not too heavy, it's more on the light side.
B00K5AFQ22|5|Nice wallet.
B005O0V23K|4|Good
B00F07MJY8|5|He loved it!
B00CFZQOHG|5|My granddaughter had her picture taken with Santa in this outfit, and it was just adorable.  It fits well, colors are bright, and it feels soft to the touch.
B005OLBY28|4|Good quality. little long, than I expeted so 1 star minus.
B00SKAG5II|3|The jacket fit as expected, but the pants were very tight.  Even after getting them let out they are a little snug.  It is NOT possible to switch out for another pair of pants...so you are going to be stuck with a very tight 32&#34; waist if you got with the 38 coat.
B004A9XT64|5|The best phantom mask  I've ever owned looks great
B00239GCZ8|5|I ordered a docen of this hat for a Mexican party Had everybody was really  happy and they look rally good we love those hats
B00IT8RW7Y|3|The fit runs small, the fabric is thin and stiff.  Disappointed
B003OQTPY4|5|It is perfect for heavy use. It is very durable. There are just enough pockets. There's a place for everything.
B004JCT4WA|5|Nice Socks, Nice price
B007TI2RRA|4|I like them because they have a long enough inseam that my underwear and crack do not hang out the back.  They have enough stretch so I can bend over easily and not feel like a stuffed sausage.  And they are narrow enough in the leg to allow for riding a bicycle around town and not get caught up in the bike gears.  Overall good practical jean without the baggy butt area..
B0009JECKQ|5|this shirt made a perfect richasrd simmons shirt the rest of this is to fill the min req for have 20 useless words for a reveiw...it's like being in school all over again
B00PYS8IDY|1|Not for you if you have wide calves. I thought that these would allow room for wider calves since they are rugby socks, but they aren't. I couldn't even get them over my ankles.
B006RB6FF0|4|I ordered 2 sizes an 8 and 12 since 10 was out of stock. Size 12 was way too large. Size 8 was a little snugg in the boob area but manageable. The size 10 would have been ideal
B007KFJYZU|5|This is a really cute swim suit.  I ordered this for my 3.5 year old who is tall for her age.  The suit fits great, with a little room to grow into.  I loved the fact that the top provides good coverage. I'm now looking for another suit for my 9 year old.
B009LLVC4C|2|Very large unfortunately. Even after several hot washes and dries.I did all the correct measurements on myself. I would order a size smaller if I ordered again.
B008LSEKJA|5|J'ai choisi ce produit en considérant sa bonne qualité, sa coupe parfaite.<br />J'aime ce pantalon car il est très agréable à porter.<br />Je recommande vivement cet article.
B001COBGAG|5|Exceeded my expectations, great quality hat.  I get lots of compliments.
B00TI002EM|5|I fell in love with this online and when I got in the mail and tried it on. It was everything that was expected. It fit perfectly, no complaints. Can't wait to hit the water now :)
B004KI108O|3|I have bought 6 Invisibelts over the last 2 years (some were Christmas gifts) and love the idea behind the belt but have had so many problems with the buckle staying together after several uses. The little tabs are just not strong enough to last for the money these belts cost. I have searched for something better but have not found anything yet but with saying all this I am currently still wearing my invisibelts and dealing with the buckle coming apart during the day. If it weren't for this buckle issue I would rate product 5 stars all the way....
B007UT56D0|3|I'm a size four and the jeans were tight.  Two other Hue small jeans fit well; a third is too large.
B00L5E0V7W|1|I never got the right size ordered two in an extra large got a large and a small. Held on to the large to keep stretching out don't wanna to order another.
B0002OQCJC|5|This, too, was one of several pair of sleep pants for my son's Christmas stuff. He's NUTS about them. They make him want to make a running start to jump & slide on the bed! MORE PLEASE!! Possible to get them in a plaid?
B00KSO3VM2|5|I bought this cardigan for my daughter to wear in the Spring and Fall. It is SO adorable. She loves it and so do I. It runs very true to size, the color goes with everything and it keeps her warm. The length is great too. She is about 3' tall and it falls about mid-thigh.
B006WFG6YQ|5|I'm a short asian man at 5'3&#34; so slimfit is hard to come by without walking into the &#34;boys&#34; section, love you for giving me an affordable alternative Doublju
B001MXM51Q|3|There is nothing special about this dress and its very sheer. I would never wear this out in public even if you wear layering because it would just not look right. The halter around the neck is very uncomfortable but the dress is loose but its just not right to wear out.
B00HWGXTAI|5|My boyfriend loves this! He wears it sometimes when we go to restaurants.
B000MX5WK8|5|Cant stand the molded cup bras for me...smash and make me look terrible...this bra has a place for my girls and no spillover...and gives me a shape instead of the pancakes the molded cups give....love, love, love...
B00NOY3JKW|2|Bought two shirts, and out of the packet the black shirt was about 1.5&#34; shorter than the charcoal gray one.
B0061U3NA2|5|Classic and fashion. Exactly as I wanted. Thank you. It is a good replacement for my old one. I tried other items, but I feel more comfortable with this one than the other.
B00DN3YV7O|5|This dress is very pretty,<br />The fabric is good quality and its true to size,<br />The length was a tad long so I had it shortened by an inch.<br />Very pleased with this dress.
B001GCVG54|4|Amazon put the wrong picture up, this is a long sleeved shirt. Doesn't look a THING like the picture up right now. If they fix the picture, then this portion of the review won't make sense, but oh well!<br />It's a nice shirt, it's a longer length so it will stay tucked into my pants. It doesn't have much of a tail, or cut around the hips, it's cut pretty much straight across the bottom which also would make it good for tucking in. The fabric is very stretchy and comfortable. The bust is sized on the small side, so there was an issue with gapping.<br />I like the tuxedo pleat detail, it's a good value! The sleeves even have nice cuffs that I fold up.
B00B89Z3G8|5|The picture does not do the colors in this scarf justice. They are absolutely beautiful. Fabric is lighter weight and can be tied in any desired style.  I love this scarf and want to order its orange and purple counterpart.
B005NHNAIO|2|too small
B00KIZMDIE|4|What a comfortable and cute shirt! The fit is amazing and I dress it up and down.
B00ESL5084|3|I have a wide foot and they are hard to get on.
B00NW9P4QQ|5|I didn't pay for a brand name  -  my money went straight to quality instead.  I love them.  I'll buy again; the finish is better than some of my dickies.
B00L7V2DK6|5|I love this scarf. The only thing I didn't like is that the material is so sensitive that it gets stuck to my earrings a lot.
B002P9HU2K|5|good shirt
B009H6L8UY|5|It was great.
B003O58YUG|5|this is a fabulous hair clip. It is well made and so much fun to wear. I highly recommend this product
B008RUOZEC|4|Needed my dress about two weeks in advance to allow time for the dress to be fitted correctly. Although the estimated shipping date was 2 months, the seller ensured I would receive my dress earlier. Very happy with the customer service because of how quick to respond they were! :) The dress arrived about 2 weeks after placing the order. The dress was just as it appeared in the photo. Tried the dress on and fitted snuggly. Went to have it hemmed and taken out a bit by the tailor. However, the day of my prom, some beads began to fall out. I was afraid my dress would fall apart while I was dancing! Made it through the night with my dress in one piece, thankfully. Not sure if this was due to how the dress was made or if this was the fault of the tailor. TL;DR: Fast shipping, excellent customer service, order a size up, you get what you pay for
B00ACIH7WE|5|These are a Valentine's day gift for my husband . he said they run a bit large. fabric and colors the same as always.
B00DS7177W|5|WOW! They came today, and they're already my favorite pants! I wore them over my spin shorts. They feel so good! A perfect fit. Im 5' 3&#34; 125 lbs. and got a small. They rest above my hips and make my back side look hot! They look relaxed and stylish. I LOVE LOVE LOVE them!!!
B00IJVQ6WS|3|The product is fine is just that I had to wait a long to wait almost three weeks. I understand that the package came along way ( China) but it is just that I had to wait.
B00L62V9AQ|5|Wear so comfortable, fit as expected. It's cost 545RMB on JD.com. I like Amazon US!
B00F673F8Q|5|Size must matter...half of those guys died. It is sending my kids the wrong message. hahaha I love this onesie.
B00NU4XT4W|4|These are quite thick and fit the requirement in winter. However, I live in the southern US which makes it a little bit awkward...
B005LLKILO|1|The ring came broken.  The part that goes around the finger was snapped off.  Couldn't even repair it with crazy glue. Very disappointed.
B0000ANHTD|5|Very happy with the fit, sizing, and material.  Great quality.
B00DM35J9Y|5|super cute, but runs small!
B005CMJESA|4|This Pooh sleep and play set is so darling on the grandson. It fits within the size range and the quality of the fabric is nice.
B00NA7WJD6|4|So comfortable and very flattering.
B0008EOGCG|4|Lee jeans, what more is there to say?
B0018OTZ26|5|Perfect fit
B0014UHK8U|2|My old, faithful JD shirt finally fell to bits after many years of concerts, clubs & parties.  I decided to buy this, but when I got it, I find it is possibly the thinnest, cheapest cotton known to mankind.  The design is a classic, so that's simply brilliant.  But I can't see this lasting even a fraction of the time my old one did, let alone surviving all the action too.
B00JUM3GSC|5|Great sweatshirt, needed a quick hoodie for an E.T. Costume, this works great!
B00KF8GJNO|5|Very comfortable and looks really nice! Recommend.
B00370IZES|3|At 30 yrs old, I am not a junior, but I occasionally buy junior's clothing because I often like the styles. I am 5'8\\", 140 lbs, and usually buy a size 6 (medium) in women's clothing and a 9 or 11 in juniors. So, when I read the sizing guide, I ordered a large (I have a 36\\" bust). Perhaps it is the intention of the style to be snug, but I find it almost unpleasantly so. The neck is also fairly high (which tends to irritate me). I will be keeping it, but I just wanted to warn any other non-junior Buffy fans that you may want to add 2 sizes to your normal women's clothing size. If you like your shirts tight, then just one size will be fine, but if you like them comfy, add 2. The seams are also tight (not stretchy).    Otherwise, the lettering is well done (but bright yellow) and the fabric is a soft lightweight cotton. The colouring was not as pictured though. Rather than red, the shirt was more of a wine/burgundy colour. Combined with the bright yellow lettering, it was not as nice looking as the shirt pictured here. The shirt I received looked like this: http://www.amazon.com/Buffy-Sunnydale-Womens-Juniors-T-Shirt/dp/B0040LP7VC/ref=pd_sbs_a_17?ie=UTF8&refRID=09N8NCVXESKFF667RPZN    Based on other reviews, I suspect that there are two versions of this Buffy shirt out there: one by Ripple Junction (represented in the picture here) and one by L.A.T. (the one I received). Perhaps it is just the luck of the draw that determines which one you will receive: the 'soft, stretchy' red one pictured here, or the tight, high-necked, wine-coloured one that I received.
B004M6XUI2|5|good
B002JVDMBM|3|Product design was as expected, quality seems to be in order, it feels tight on the forehead so I taped a piece of cardboard on the upper edge to minimize discomfort.
B00FSL9VSS|4|The dark wash ones always seem to run a little small. The pants are super cute though. And I'm so glad to find these on Amazon as they can be hard to find elsewhere.
B00NSD5E20|3|zipper sticks terrible,they won't pay for return shipping...not happy
B00FA42CWU|5|very good!
B000SKP6HO|3|I got them because they were larger sized than my size 9-12 socks. I was disappointed that they were about as tight as my regular 9-12 size socks. The Hanes premium version 9-12 socks were looser/more comfortable than these socks. I think the foot part might be slightly larger than the 9-12, but the elastic was too tight on the leg part.
B000A2K8DW|5|Riggs Workwear By Wrangler Men's Ripstop Carpenter Jean,Bark,38x32 Tough material and well made<br />Riggs Workwear By Wrangler Men's Ripstop Carpenter Jean,Bark,38x32 Tough material and well made
B00AARKHO2|4|I bought these scrubs specifically because of the multiple pockets on each side of the pants.  They DO NOT DISAPPOINT!! Great color, nice material. They did stretch out a bit during wear so I might try the next size down the next time I buy a pair. I will definitely buy another pair of these!
B0089GWPS2|5|Bought this for my son to put his medical id tag on and he loves it. Very sturdy,and well made.
B00GA7PVE2|4|Bought this for my daughter and she loves it thank you Amazon
B009IO40KA|1|Does not fit like any ymi I have ever owned
B009DZDBA4|5|Heard that they run a little tight so I got one size bigger than I would normally and they fit perfectly! I am a size 36 so I got a 38.
B00JX4Q5L2|3|I normally wear a woman's medium in Nike dri-fit polo shirts. Based on the comments about this running small, I ordered a large. It was too big and I had to return it. The feedback on this is so inconsistent I don't know what to recommend. I just wanted to share my sizing experience.
B00LNHPJ28|5|good product
B00M34F71S|5|I got this shirt for my boyfriend and it came in very fast!!! It came in 4 days earlier than expected!! Very satisfied with how it looks! The sizing is just right!!!
B00E51Y5E2|5|Excelent buy!  Fits and feels so cool...
B00B2DUZFE|5|the size fit what they say, my girlfriend likes it and it turns me on, what more can i expect !
B008MAWTKY|4|Was not blue, black robe instead.
B00JZ1RL2K|5|Love these! Super comfortable and look professional.
B00A2LXG8K|1|highly desepcionado
B00IGAOCO6|2|I got mines after about a month. But what I seen in the picture is nothing of what I got! I won't deal with returning etc. but idk kind of sad. And it's from China? I ordered a xl or l I forgot and got a xxxl and it says 90 like hello? I guess I don't have the best luck!
B001KUQM88|5|for all crip walkers out there......i recommend this..its comfortable to make videos wearing this during the autumn xD its a ghetto scarf to me
B0009MDES4|3|Lightweight, Small front pocket, barely the size of my cell phone.
B00MX6DJZC|5|Beautiful scarf.
B002XULOOG|4|Kids needed these for dance recital.  Each wore the same size they do in capezio leotards.  White fabric is slightly shiny, but not hugely so.
B00K7IQVZ8|3|Dont know.  Bought as a gift.
B001FOR2D8|5|I have this and the other similar Columbia belt.  Both are great belts!  Material is super strong and holds up well.  Great value, highly recommended!
B00K4EJEH2|2|The dress fit fine but it was not at all flattering.  Pretty on the hanger though.
B00SU65EOS|1|My shirt was way too small to be and extra large unless it was for a junior
B00N25TTUC|5|Thanks
B00PW3A1CM|1|Love the shorts just disappointed  that they were to small for my friend. This was also a gift and it was late being delivered.

B000XCV5BS|5|top of the line product!!!!!!sharp,different v-neck.  volcom products are always a class act---the Andean is typical--sizing runs to the athletic build.  material is beautiful!!!!!!!
B00FZ0M10C|5|I'm 5'6&#34; and about 170lbs. I have a 36DD cup size so most of the time lingerie doesn't fit right in the chest area. This is great because the material stretches and it fit me wonderfully.
B008003RHU|5|Cute
B004JZ8XEC|4|It's very cute but a little loose on me, I am a size 12-14. I also don't fill in the top as a D-cup but I just unzip a little or wear a bra.
B004UUK3GC|4|These are fun to wear, but not in the rain.  If I could find fault with these shoes, it would be that the soles needed to be a tad bit thicker but more pliable.
B000K0I7F0|5|As I'm writing this, I'm waiting for my suit to arrive. A few years ago, I had one of the enterprise suits which I loved. With age, I seemed to put on a few pounds & out grew the suit. I first went to department stores to try on different suits & slacks to update my formal wear as I had a wedding this past summer to attend. Along my journey I came across the Haggar mynx garbadine pants with the flexible waist. I tried a pair on & low & behold - the most comfortable slacks I have EVER worn. I say this without hesitation. I bought three pairs (black, oak, chocolate). As I continued looking for suits, I initially tried & bought the Dockers pinstripe suit.  But after trying on again at home, the pants were very uncomfortable & I returned the suit. I then went & tried on a Haggar suit just to get a feel for the fit. When I saw the suit pants also had the flexible waist, I did not hesitate again. I went online to the Haggar site & was ready to puchase but something kept holding me back. Despite a decent price from Haggar.com for the suit ($119+free shipping), something told me to go ahead & shop around. I found myself on Amazon.com after a google search to a few other links & checking other stores which didn't seem to carry a plain black suit from Haggar. In finding the solid black online for the price ($76 jacket/$26 pants) & the size (46L/36x34), I couldn't pass this up this time. In signing up for the prime option to take advantage of two-day shipping, I made the purchase. As I have a gala event coming this Sunday (10/23), I'm really looking forwad to sporting this suit with my wife in her cocktail gown!r
B000815M2C|4|These are much nicer than I anticipated.  The black pair I ordered has a type of contrasting large pinstripe down the material and it makes the pants look more expensive than they are.  The only complaint I have is about the sizing.  The XXL says they fit 43-47&#34; waists.  I wear a 44&#34; and they fit perfectly.  If I were any bigger they wouldn't button.
B00MVSK7FM|1|Wayyyyy to small cheaply made and it came with a hole in the back from being poorly made do not buy
B00F2ZX4ZQ|3|gave as a gift
B0120UACD2|5|I love it. it's comfy and breezy, but be careful if you have to pick something up. your goods might be showing, lol
B0006I4886|5|Fit very will, material is soft and silky, and they wash beautifully.  These will definitely be reordered when needed.  Well worth the price.
B000JIH8WQ|5|Bras really are a personal preference and a mix of size and feel/comfort.  But, I nursed six children and wore nothing else. Honestly.  The Medela sleep bra really is the most comfortable but you must size up when your milk comes in, the return to your normal size after the baby/toddler nurses for awhile --if you choose to continue to nurse. For those of you who don't nurse, the Medela bra is a wonderfully covenient bra with enough support to sleep comfortably, or to wear under a gown or hoodie when you in the hospital, first arrive home, or long after your child has grown. It's just that comfortable.
B00EZG2RZ6|2|these are soft yes but I think they are really for boys.  very short.
B00GRLVW12|5|Tunic top fits wonderful. Good quality and ships fast.
B0084R1W2Q|5|Wish I could still wear this dress!  It is so comfortable, I wore it with leggings nearly every day of my pregnancy. Unfortunately it is cut long in the front to fit a belly, although I might try to hem it so I can wear it again.
B000METTBA|5|I love this bra its very sexy. It fit perfectly I will be buying the other colors. But I wish it had panties to match.
B002R5E5PC|5|Holding up well after three washes so far, and still soft and fresh looking.
B003C537UK|5|Purchased the wallet as a gift for my boyfriend. It's really nice quality, and just as described. The wallet was a lot darker in person- almost looked black- not near as brown as it does in the picture. It has the silver Longhorn emblem shown on the outside of the wallet, an embossed longhorn on the inside of the wallet, and is lined with fabric that has longhorns and the UT crest on it. It's gorgeous!
B002CMLOPO|3|Great color and stretch, waist/high hips is too tight but still wearable. Great 33&#34; length which is 1&#34; longer than what I usually buy for my 6'5&#34; frame. Will keep but next time buy one size up.
B004A7YLPY|5|the leather is good, not a big capacity but very good made at all, will recommend it to my friends
B00OQG6SWS|5|I am going to by more socks, they are great.
B003AU5VZQ|4|These are quite short, the picture makes them look a little longer than they really are.
B00JXSOIGC|5|very cute
B007PWX7TC|5|Bought this for my son and he really liked it.  It fit good.  Nice quality.
B00NPEJAAO|3|The wrist bands are really tight. We had to cut ours to get our baby's arms through and have it be comfortable. But otherwise, it's an adorable print.
B00CISAO12|4|Great price for the quality of this Jacket
B00COG9C8E|5|Love these jeans their so much cuter in person the pics don't do them justice love love love them . Love the color the ripped look on the front of them the style everything definitely a must have !
B00FSB5VNW|5|A little long, but otherwise great sweats -- light colored & weight, as I'd<br />hoped for!  These are truly excellent pants & I plan to get a couple more<br />pairs! Thank you for fine service, nice price & exceptional item.
B0090CKKEK|2|I've used this bra only once and wore it for maybe 4 hours tops on a night out on the town. Because this bra isn't breathable, moisture kept building up under it and wouldn't allow it to stick after the 2nd hour. I would have to go to the bathroom and wipe off any moisture and reapply it before it fell off into my backless dress! I'm afraid to wear this bra again and rather save myself the embarrassment of it falling off.
B00EPKEQVA|5|It was the perfect gift for my sister!
B00HC07JT6|5|Gorgeous dress. Purchased for a wedding. It is super long and I'm 5'6 so it had to be altered.
B00AK4CP9U|3|I bought these expecting them to fit like the black and gray pair that i also have, however these don't fit the same. They are a little large
B004YVUIEE|4|i like it
B00AH7JOH6|5|Great product...Great price...Great delivery
B006HFJA12|5|Just buy it..you won't be mad that you did..
B008H2ETBE|5|I haven't had these long enough to know how they're going to hold up but they fit my size 12 feet and are very comfortable. The elastic holds tight without being so tight it leaves marks on my legs.
B00UNFZELC|4|Halo charger is fine,  the wallet is not the best quality
B00V98VMVS|5|My custom shirt fit perfect thank you
B00JQRHSK8|4|The size chart skips 31&#34; waist. Bought medium they fit and are very comfortable, trying Small next to see if any better.
B00QYK9ZMO|4|These are cute skirts at a great price. My girly-girl daughter loves them!  They do run a bit small... I ordered the 6 and my daughter typically wears a 4 or 5... These fit her perfectly. Order a size up and enjoy the fun and frills of life as a little girl. :)
B00IK5MECE|3|My biggest concern with buying clothing online is how it will fit.  I travel a lot and return policies are just a big hassle to me.<br /><br />I followed the size measures and purchased M for this shirt (I am typically M). Shoulders and sleeves fit perfectly. Waist and length are larger than expected (I'd say an inch wider and longer than what I would consider M), which is a bummer.  Fabric and quality of the shirt is great, I really like it.  I can live with the way it fits, I just know it could fit better, probably I should go with S on this brand.
B00MH62YN6|5|Did not wear it or wash it yet but tried it on and it fits as expected and has very nice material. I am a true xl.
B008YCPD7Q|2|The biggest problem was the size.  I ordered a 12 plus which is the size of other pants that fit my daughter, but this was WAY too small.  She couldn't even get it buttoned.  I also knew as soon as I saw it that she wouldn't like it because it looked like a boy's pant, which she agreed, and refused to wear even if they did fit.  I guess if you need this for a school uniform or something, it might work, just order at least one, maybe two, sizes bigger than she usually wears!
B00NVE364E|1|Image was very distorted and the color was wrong!! The dress was blue and almost sheer!
B003TKDHLM|4|I love this set, I would recommend it
B00EZGWWAG|5|The best fit.
B007XD5MTG|1|Ordered three items from this seller, didn't expect much considering the low price but it's not worth paying a penny for! All three tops were xs but actually all totally different sizes, only one more or less fit me, second was too big and third way too small and all of them totally disproportional. Plus the buttons were falling of with first attempt to unbutton the blouse and all seams had threads hanging on the ends. Sending everything back!
B002BTUCKG|4|Good looking hat. The rim is easy to shape.<br />One minus though, the metal in the vent holes sometimes snag hairs when you take it off.
B007CRR7ZA|5|Perfect fit for a 9 pound baby. I bought like 3 packs since i change my newborn at least 3-5 times a day.
B00BDPXIJG|3|I bought this for my husband, it ran small for him, just a little bit, but he kept it to see if maybe wearing it could be more loose after some hour, it seams, but in my opinion, he looks a little bit tight on them.
B0090TCMYE|5|My Wife is gorgeous and in this she looks amazing we had lots of fun times and nice evenings with this one.
B005OS4Y2S|5|Loved the hat! Shipped fast!
B004XFGJFI|5|I was impressed with the quality. It is warm but not heavy. Ordered a small and fits perfectly.
B00NZU5YXA|5|Thank you
B004H4WHC4|2|I bought these because there is a small selection of preemie onesies available for our 4lb son. I was disappointed when they came and they more accurately should be sized as Newborn. These will not fit a preemie baby weighing less than 7lb! They are actually larger than some of the newborn clothes we have for our son.
B000H7NAR6|5|This is a very comfortable bra...have worn this brand and style for years. Glad to have found it on Amazon.
B00IGAOBEC|1|Size is wrong small is more like a large. Not a real cincher or trainer, no steel bones.
B00F86QUZA|4|Like it
B00J51FGOU|5|As usual Pendleton quality is superb.  This will be a nice basic sweater for next fall and winter.
B00IAZ137Q|4|Shirt was a little small but it worked for one of my pants that I love and made the fit a must.
B00NGPT28C|5|Very nice and good quality.
B008UKBB4G|5|I got these for my grandson. He is 2 1/2 and normally wears 2T, but got these in 4T and they fit great.  They are snug but should be.  The pant legs are a little long, but because they fit so well we just bunch them up.  Have washed them several times and they are still just as bright as when I originally bought.  And of course he loves Yo Gabba Gabba so he loves these pajamas!  Would recommend.  Just get a size up.
B008LY4FA8|4|After reading the reviews that these pants run smaller than expected I ordered up one size. The regular pants too long and a little loose; the petites length was great and they are still a little loose but I'd rather go that way then too tight. The shirt I again ordered up one size and I really like it!!
B00A2Y1W4C|5|I really love these workout pants and the material they are made out of. They keep me from chaffing and help maintain sweat. I am 5'4&#34; and they are a bit long but nothing unmanageable.
B00P8NSPQ0|5|This company really understands that were all human! I ordered a beautiful wool coat for my friend but I ordered the wrong size, they were quick and understanding of my situation and helped me out greatly, definitely worth recommending for great products and for outstanding costumer service!!
B001KNXUFI|3|Ordered it for my upcoming military ball. Looks decent and fits as described. I do recommend buying it for a formal event.
B005CGHNX4|5|This two-piece outfit is just as cute as can be.  Love the Minnie Mouse logo.  It's easy to put on and washes well.  You won't be disappointed if you choose this.
B00GT65VOY|5|Fit good
B00ACIFZ50|3|Slightly larger than i thought. Good price for 6 pieces of t shirt.
B00R4WTU8U|1|Great if you are 5'9&#34; - I'm only 5'3&#34; and they are extremely long and larger than expected.
B0072JALMO|2|So I read the sizing chart before purchasing. And the delivery is really fast, which I appreciate. But it's too large.<br />Wondering if washing will make it shrink...If it does, then I really need it to shrink A LOT to fit...
B00JWO2LPC|5|I bought this for a gift so I dint know anything about the fit but it is a quality hat and I love the leather brim.
B0012BRSME|5|great pants! fit great!  Perfect casual khakis.  Great for work, church or knock around.  Not too formal, but dressier than jeans.
B00RUE4M4O|3|could have been better built because the seam came out on the first wash. other than that wife likes them.
B00FK519UK|5|So cute! I love it, and it came 2-3 weeks before it was scheduled to.  The sweater is soft and not itchy, but still feels quite warm.  Perfect &#34;ugly&#34; Christmas sweater!
B006T84166|4|This is a very excellent wig, especially for the price.  It's soft, and doesn't tangle *too* easily.<br /><br />I can only give this wig 4/5 stars though, because it doesn't style.  I was trying to turn this into a Merida wig.  I used got2b hairspray.  After spraying the wig down, even a curling iron set to a high temp wouldn't get the hair to hold a curl.  got2b is really good spray with a super strong hold.  I've styled others wigs with it successfully.  However, I practically doused this wig in the spray, and then let it sit for HOURS in hair curlers.  NOTHING.  This will WILL NOT hold a curl.<br /><br />On that note, however, the wig has a good thickness.  You could successfully ponytail or pigtail this wig without worrying about seeing the wefts and cap too much.
B00A3HGCDO|3|My waist is around 39 so I ordered 40 but the pants i received with the tag 40W * 32L is too big for me and when i measured it, it actually 43 44 which is just stupid.<br /><br />fabric is nice and even cutting and style is also very nice but you better order 1 or 2 inch less then your actual waist.
B00AN9K6DE|5|One of my favorite shirts, love wearing it, to me it honors one of my relatives who was a Tuskegee Airmen.
B00K5KO4EI|4|Fits right
B006W4UPQW|5|For the price, you can't go wrong with this mask. It really enhances the Mark 42 costume a great deal.
B00G2PE53K|5|We don't wear shoes in the house and these are perfect. They don't slip and I love all the colors. I did find the elastic to be too tight but that was easily fixed with scissors.
B0009MZVU8|5|My husband really likes this sock and he has difficulty with socks losing their shape and support. He has athletic legs and stretches them out. These are in the wash a lot and have stood up to lots of use without losing shape or comfort.
B004M6UDF0|4|Nice wallet. Would have liked the money clip on one side and the card pockets on the other, but that is just my style request. Good quality and well made.
B003ZWCEBS|5|I love penguins, this wallet is perfect. Not to big not to small, money slides in easy and my cards slide out easy without falling out. What more could ya ask for?
B00KKH1BYC|5|Item delivered on time, was as described,
B00RNCZQ34|5|Jacket arrived well before it was expected to.  We ordered a large hoping that it would fit: jacket actually fit perfectly even with the hoodie part inside.
B00HV6349K|4|I ordered it one size larger than was needed due to the reviews but it was still too small. Products from China need to be identified in the description instead of in the reviews and there should be a size chart indicating how many sizes larger clothing needs to be compatible to US sizing. The other thing is once it comes from China it is kinda hard to return. Nice shirt just too small. :-(
B00AUKM0EE|5|Beautiful dress and excellent quality, I really recommend this item. It fits very nice and looks gorgeous. The colors are vivid.
B00J2D7QT4|5|I love these pants! They fit as expected!  I'm 5'3 165 lbs and I ordered a large because of the reviews I read prior to purchase.The material allows the pants to show all my curves in a good way. I think a medium would have made me look  trashy no classy!  Great buy!
B007HVA8QQ|5|I highly recommend this dress. It is very flattering on my petite but pear shaped figure. I have received several compliments. I especially like that it is lined. It looks great under a suit jacket allowing me to continue to wear it into the Fall season. I am very happy with this purchase
B00A1EYX6M|5|This headband is super cute, super fashionable and super comfortable! I have worn it quite a few times now; it's great for work, a night out, a lazy Sunday. So, I suppose I should say it is also super functional and versatile! I will probably be ordering more from this company.
B008LWQP4O|5|Love it.
B00LLV8I3S|3|You get what you pay for.  It needed some stitching right out of the bag.  It is not very breathable but if it passes the rain test, I will be satisfied with the price
B00EIMVZMI|1|I paid almost $140 for what you seller said was NEW deluxe buzz light year costume. What I received instead was a USED sad costume. Has a huge snag on the front and several small ones all over. Also sooo dingy. Totally ripped off. Even the material is worn out. So disappointing. Mister seller shame on you. Was not able to return it. As soon as my grandson saw it he hopped right into it. Unfortunately it looks like a hand me down.
B00DZ3RKFM|5|warm and attractive. I did not find it necessary to use the red star. but the hat is an extremely good choice for cold weather.
B00C5H29JG|5|This outfit was purchased as part of a baby gift set I put together and my friends loved the outfit on their daughter.
B009AMRX7W|3|I love the fit of these shirts but the white is complete see through.
B009A117N4|5|I really love this belt!  It is very well made and the adjustment feature is really great. Its also nice that if its a bit too long it can easily be taken apart, cut, and put back together. All belts should be like this!
B00AENBXWW|3|These are very nice socks. Great for hiking boots. But don't offer much compression value at all. I suppose if you had bigger feet/legs they might work. Overall I like them but I think \\"compression\\" is a loose word.
B00Q3FU3MG|5|Gorgeous!
B00421BNPO|5|very cute  - I am happy with this purchase and fit is great.
B00567FTG2|3|i though this size would fit, due to I have a large breast area. But whem I put this on because of breast area it made the waist lien ride up to chest area. you need to make body of the tiop postion of this dress longer so if someone wherea large chest area would fit it better. other then that the material of this dress was great not that poly blend cheap stuff.
B00AKSCY9M|5|Have bought these before, they are great for every day wear around the house
B00OQ2XCXA|1|Hate to even give this a one star. Quality is cheap, falling apart and way small. Don't buy! So disappointed. Nothing like advertised. Made for tiny, tiny people! Plus took forever to even come. Makes sense because it came from China. Horrible!!!
B00P3N6M56|1|A large piece of material! Im going to cut it up and let my daughter make doll clothes out of it. HORRIBLE
B00XM886PS|5|It is roomy and it holds the cards I am using. The 6 key rings is very good holds all the keys I used.
B00VT5KGXQ|4|I am 5'3 and the length is just perfect if I was any taller it would be too short. I am 123 lbs waist is 28&#34; hips are 37&#34; and legs are 22&#34; I bought the large and they are tight. If I was any bigger it would be uncomfortable. Really cute, a little itchy. Smelled weird at first but washed them and they are good now. Def worth the price.
B00BQ5JWWU|5|I like the product in the ever ending search for hip, comfortable and stylish jeans.<br />Wear a size 2 in most jeans and the size 27 worked for me.
B00EBNOQNO|3|This is a well made pocket wallet which might work for most people, but if you carry more than 3 cards, you might not like it. First, the slots are VERY tight to insert the 3 cards. If you have any dexterity issues with your fingers, the cards may be very difficult for you to remove, especially the one in the back slot. While the magnetic clip may be strong enough to hold a few bills folded over, I did not like the fact that the bills cover part of the front slot, effectively making it a little harder to remove the card. There is a nice slot on the opposite side for your license, and a larger pocket which I ended up carrying my bills in instead of the clip.<br />After using this for a couple of days, I already know it is not for me primari'y due to the difficulty of removing the cards from the very tight slots. I will go back to using a similar product from Columbia which I had been using before but had worn it out...maybe too much use from spending too much money,
B00WM3RMZY|5|Very pretty. Light cotton material. True to size.
B00ZZ48RAQ|5|I love Meaneor's clothes, there always so well made.  I tried to get you a picture of the stitching so you could see for yourself.  This is made to last, yet affordable.<br /><br />I was concerned about the size, I'm a bit larger than most Asians.  However I found the material to be very stretchy and the X-Large fits me very nicely.  I also like that the sizes fit multiple US sizes, so as I loose weight this will continue to fit me for quite some time and just look nicer.<br /><br />About the cut:  The lacy part in the back is beautiful.  However it does go down to your waist, so a bra strap will be noticeable, and yes you'll want on in this.  I really like how the waist line is a little high, it helps hide those extra pounds.  It ends around my knee's which is a length I personally like, it's loose, but doesn't go up too high if you spin (dancing), it mostly bellows out.<br /><br />Overall: For under $20 this dress just can't be beat, I'm picking one up as a gift because you really can wear it anywhere.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
B00IX7FV42|5|So cute and fit perfect. Fast shipping
B00168ADBQ|5|I got the order very fast and it is exactly as was described possibly even better , and execellent product and service!
B00JK039ZO|3|Adjustable, yes, but doesn't lay as nicely as previous order.
B00AQJ7I96|2|For 20 years I have purchased Carhartt button-up t-shirts because of quality and also because the were sized more comfortably (larger) than most other T's.  Until, that is, this new design which boasts water-wicking ability.  The craftsmanship is as good as always, just be aware that these size about the same as every other t-shirt on the market.  Two stars for the disappointment. I returned the one I had not worn. Would like to have returned all but I didn't want to be &#34;one of those people.&#34; One other BIG gripe.  I HATE the new glued-on Carhartt label.  I buy clothes to wear not to advertise for some company. Always before I could take a razor blade and remove the Carhartt advertising so I could be me not Mr. Carhartt. Can't do that with this super-glued on label. That, in itself, is enough to drive me to a different brand.
B00719X7IK|5|Comfortable sweatshirt that doesn't turn you into a walking billboard for their brand.  This is my third purchase of this item.
B003WYIFU8|4|Grandson loves his shorts.
B003BAGO8S|5|Awesome shirt, perfect fit really. It's tighter and nice and thin, but durable - exactly what I would expect. Unfortunately a dog bit a hole in mine, but that just adds to the official Charlie look I suppose.
B00AG4PQPY|5|These pants are made well and are very comfortable.  You can wear them in most climates.
B00IZXE34S|4|Love these shirts but they are much too small.....  Always wear a large but these are really a small medium.....
B007BG9ZN4|5|The shirt is such soft cotton.  It is very true to size plus we now have our own adorable minion!
B0027BHKH6|5|These are comfy, nice shorts.  The fit and feel is good.  They last a reasonably long time.<br />The 2XL fits a 46&#34; waist nicely.  I'm sure would fit a 48 or 50&#34; waist too.
B00RME93YQ|2|Nice wallet but when I put my cards in the inner frabic is weak and tears and the inside stitching comes apart. It won't last for me , but if you don't mind the inside coming apart very nice.
B008DPZNLU|2|Although the band and underwire fit correctly, the fabric at the top wrinkled as if there was an excess of material. Not the best, sent this one back.
B00IG3M4Y8|5|I'm short, so I had to hem the dress, but it's quickly become one of my favorite dresses. Chic with a touch of 'sassy'
B0038AB5Y4|3|I am a 36D and this runs big.  The D part fits good, its the 36 that is big and the straps are slightly to long also. But the quality of the fabric is good.  I did find the clasps in the back to be odd.  I still have to pull it over my head to put on and then try to clasp it. Very odd.
B000CQUK5W|5|Excellent fit and feeling. Good work
B005ETA4T4|3|So excited when I found this swimsuit on amazon. Ordered my usual size and was waiting patiently for the set to arrive...Got the swimsuit and tried on immediately. The bottoms are REALLY low. Might be good for juniors/teens but otherwise would not wear in public again. To bad i'm not 18 anymore :(
B0012BQ4QK|5|Tried on the cargo shorts after receiving it and it fits well, looks good and should be very useful when playing golf.
B00LQKZEDG|3|Not nearly as warm as I thought it would be.  Barely any down in it, and the wind seems to go right through it. I do like the removable fur collar.
B00N8CJX8M|5|Fit as expected. Colors look better than online.
B0062HN4NU|3|The Hello Kitty Women's Hk Enchanting Blues Tank and Pajama Set in Navy is ADORABLE! The only problem is that the sizing runs small. I bought a medium (I'm a Size 6) and it's WAY small! Still wearable.<br /><br />Cute as Heck,just go up a size!
B00BCY746G|5|Got these for my lady. She loves crazy leggings like this. Received them on time, and they fit perfectly!! :-) Extra points for this guy!
B0006I4BCO|5|I'm 5'7&#34; and slender, and the medium size (6) fits perfectly.
B0067FKC2I|5|fits alot
B00K64PZ14|1|I ordered this dress in a small and received a medium. Called amazon, they said they would expedite another in the correct size, as I am on a time crunch. Received a medium again! The dress itself is good material, would be super cute in the correct size.
B008D1OUFO|5|This is a smart looking black skirt.  I also have the matching jacket and the combo looks very sharp worn together!  I would definitely recommend this skirt!  The bit of detail on the skirt makes it unique.
B000ENT7HU|4|I got these for my daughter for a day and it served its purpose. She can still use it for other occasions.
B00WWSPU8U|4|This top is really cute.  I love the stitching and the fit is flattering, even for larger busts.  My only complaint is that the detailed hem pulls the shirt in at the bottom, creating a bit of a balloon effect.  Otherwise, it would have been 5 stars.
B009MYM4HM|3|love and hate relationship .. it leaves a line that you can tell you are wearing something odd..but when it does the job it does the job.
B00BZP1OCC|1|Save your money and your dignity and shop for something else. Workmanship is just horrible. Feels like it is made by kids in a sweatshop
B00BBW7TSM|2|The shoulders are not sewn well. Kind of pointed.
B008LULFPU|4|The are pretty good shorts but are a little stiff when new.  After several washings they get much better and a lot softer
B008RYBEVA|4|Great coat and design. My husband did not give it a 5 because he thought it could be a little heavier. Definitely a nice cost though, 2 thumbs up.
B00JM93PUM|5|Grandson was delighted, age 8 , was delighted
B00NC2TUX6|3|Its was small for an xL
B00BEJ3LCK|5|Kili is so fine!!  Wonderful Image!!  Great Color!  Wears well, washes well, retains its shape, flattering, and just plain nice to wear!!  Nice to see peoples' expressions when they see this shirt!
B007PVDRMU|4|Really liked the colors and the design however it was a little lighter than expected receiver of the gift liked it.
B00B9HHQNW|5|Excellent cap, the materials and the fabric quality are excellent, this is one of the best caps I ever had.<br />Stetson's caps are one of the best options in the market.
B004M6XUI2|4|It's good for what it cost. It's leather and has plenty of slots. It was a bit tight on my cards at first but it's loosening up ok after a couple of weeks.
B009MI6UT6|3|Ok underwear.  Wouldn't buy again due to high price.  Not really justified.
B00N2C8V18|5|Love! Love! Love this dress!! Ordered and sent over custom measurements ...great material..received in 15 days as promised ..my Niece loves it!!!<br /><br />Thank you so much
B00AZGFDRE|3|Pretty good for the price.  Fringe comes off easily so not good for more than 1-2 wearings.
B00H3LIS94|4|If you are in a really hot area like the south or get hit with a DC heat wave this shirt is too hot. That being said its a great fit and great for spring/early summer. But 80 and above my son is sweating out of this shirt. Color are vibrant and stay after washes.
B00L9H514S|4|my daughter  liked it
B007VIYWC6|4|I purchased a pair of these jeans in the dark denim blue color at Kohls with the same size but these fit smaller, especially in the waist. When I read the descriptions of what the jeans are made of on both pair, they are slightly different with these having less cotton and made in Pakistan while the other has more cotton and made in China. Still it seems like a 16M should fit the same regardless. Otherwise, the jeans are great.
B002HELRJU|4|It met my requirement. Did not give 5 stars as I thought the price was high.
B000WVALGK|3|It's like having a small man-purse. I gave this away as a gift when I realized I didn't enjoy it. It was appreciated by the new owner.<br /><br />It wasn't quite skinny enough for a front pocket wallet IMO.
B00OVYCS7Y|4|Fun! Quality is good. I recommend them.
B0055LJ3IY|4|For the price this is a good item. If you are buying for a wedding or other formal event, spend more money and get a better crinoline. This is what you would find in a Halloween shop. I was purchasing for a one-time costume for a school play and it worked wonderfully. For the price, it was exactly what I expected. I did not want to spend a lot for a simple costume and this worked great. The shipping was fast. I would buy from again.
B000Z13LXM|5|My boyfriend loves these coveralls.  They are easy to put on and take off.  They didn't shrink at all when washed and dried on high heat
B00AFWIXUM|5|Love it. It's a great addition to my other 100 Pink Floyd T-Shirts
B001PN118G|1|Horrible dress. Awful fabric. Poor quality tailoring. Through the mesh can be seen not processed seams (cloth unevenly cut off). Between mesh and the fabric thread are visible. Remove them from there it is not possible. The dress looks cheap.
B0097DN8X2|5|Fit perfect and feel great on! Not too thick not too thin. Love them!
B00E79XKNE|5|The perfect princess dress for a party.
B008G1IF02|5|love it! so cute. fits perfect
B00CB3EUA0|5|This T-shirt ran true to size and is a beautiful rich color. It washes well and is something that I would buy again from this company.
B0058ZFAU2|5|Nice quality belt for the price. This belt is built to last.
B00N44PJ82|3|They are cute slippers. Too tight to tuck pants in but no big deal. There is no grip on the bottom so it will be slippery for little walkers.
B009TAGUNI|1|This is a popular brand.  We saw this backpack at a store when we were on vacation, for double the price.  We did not buy it at that department store.  We thought we would be able to purchase it for a better price on Amazon.  Well, sure enough we did find it on Amazon and of course for a lot less.  We were so excited.  We got this for my teenage daughter to start off the school year in August.  By the end of October the straps were coming UN-sewn.  Soon all the way.  It became totally unusable.  It will not even work out for us to mend the straps back on.  It will not hold.  Backpacks should be made to endure lots of weight.  Our school kids including college kids have lots of books and supplies to carry.  Backpacks are heavy.  This backpack is not worth the purchase if you plan on carrying heavy books.  Maybe for light weight use.
B008L0H964|5|Surprisingly good value. Excellent fit and quality.
B0038SZI6C|1|I bought two pair of these socks about 5 mos. ago, and one pairs heel already has multiple holes in them. I would not recommend them to anyone. Too thin by half.
B00BCUPK0C|4|Good fit and perfect length.  Just had to enlarge the top button.  Someone did not double check the button opening on top of the zipper because it was almost completely closed up, so I fixed that and they are perfect.
B00CLYZVPW|5|It fits exactly as I expected it too. It hits at just the right spot in front for a person with a long torso. It's perfect with leggings. :)
B009IMVGS6|3|Kinda cheap but does have a nice look to it.. the price is right on this one so you are getting what you pay for.
B0044XHGJW|5|I bought his for my biology labs. I love how feminine it is. The fabric is stiff. I am 5'5&#34; and about 195 pounds and this fits well, although I don't have much extra space. I am usually an XL and that is what I bought so it fits as expected.
B0094VP67S|5|PERFECT, my financee loved them!
B00IVLPTJ2|4|Got this for a hash &#34;red dress&#34; run. The only bad thing is once it gets wet it will sag and fall. Do not use for anything other than the bedroom.
B00BCYDRNK|3|I purchased this for my daughter's first birthday party.  It is very cute but fits very odd.  My daughter normally wears 12-18 month in size.  The shirt fits a bit large and the pants fit perfect.  The shirt is very hard to get on and off which makes for an unhappy baby!  I love mudpie clothing but do not like the way any of it fits.  I WANTED to love it, unfortunately I did not.
B00M2ZHCXE|1|Didn't like it
B007GE39OM|5|Comfortable low rise, good compression for a great feel all day. nothing more to say really
B00NJ8CZ80|3|It looks different in the photo than it looks on. It so gathered at the bottom unless you pull it up.
B00CTA6UQW|5|well made worth the price
B00A44KXU4|4|Really cute dress i think i will have to take it apart and size it to my body because the hip and armpit area is huge even on the XS. The color is more of a dirty blue (think blue jeans color) . I was sad it wasnt as turquoise as the photo but i can not complain pretty cute little latex dress :)
B001MKBSAS|5|It's a good suit for boy with reasonable price. My son loves it. He looks so nice with this suit. He wore it to see Ballet Show. He will wear it again in his piano recital and Xmas Party soon.
B00ES4RTJ4|5|I'm going to wear these as part of my CATS costume that I am going to wear on Halloween.  They're very cute and I hope that they'll be warm.
B0096UOY34|5|great hat, very shape-able, comfortable
B00CDC2UEC|4|I ordered up based on reviews but I really didn't have to. The shirt is a little large but it's OK for this style because I think it's OK for it to be a little oversized. The material is so soft and comfy. I really like the whole thing and I know now if I get it in another color (which I probably will!), to get my regular size.
B00PH1NAPE|3|I got a 2XL based on the reviews that the sizes come in a tad bit small. But when I got it, it was actually true to size (I'm a 1X) so it didn't fit me well. But with a bit of sewing, I was able to alter it to fit perfectly.
B004BAQWUM|5|fit great and washes great, great for new ref and this is something that the tssaa require you to have
B00KYG7X6E|5|love sonny with a chance
B000J688HC|5|I have chubby arms and was worried they wouldn't fit but they do! They are a nice satin stretchy non cheep or itchy material, for the price they are worth it
B00HFZDPGO|5|Fits great, looks, great, didn't cost an arm and a leg :)
B0046MFR8S|5|I purchased these boxers for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day. They arrived promptly. He really enjoys the boxers, and says that they are comfortable and fit well. He wears them all the time. These were really worth the price!
B0008G3KGM|1|I have ordered these jeans twice.  The first time, I had to return because of the size.  Not a problem.<br /><br />So, I ordered again in a different size.  Today, the jeans came, the size is fine, but I received a pair of cropped pants instead of jeans.  The pants are 4-5 inches shorter than a similar, same brand, pair I already own.  I'm not sure that Amazon even offers this style.<br /><br />I have a difficult time finding jeans that fit and I was so hoping that I had found a place to purchase them.  Maybe, I'll try again, third times a charm, they say.
B00MNGO5D2|5|Like and Love this shirt
B0058LXO0O|4|New style for me, so far so good. Will have to see how it launders
B005CQSLCQ|5|These pajamas are so comfy and classy I'm considering buying some in the other colors.  I don't normally like pajamas preferring nightgowns.  I got these to wear to a Polar Express train ride with my grandkids. I've gotten several compliments from friends.
B00BNUV8SE|2|The material is good. But they must have been designed by a woman who hates men. There is exactly ZERO room in the crotch. If you sit, squat or even move too quickly you could hurt yourself badly. I bought them for work; therefore they are no use to me.<br />if they added a crotch gusset and a little more room they'd be great. Too bad.
B00C4RT0EE|5|The jeans are exactly what I wanted.  Always scary ordering clothes online...I prefer being able to try on.  These fix exactly like my store bought Silvers.  Delivery was quick!
B004QGY4NI|5|I wasn't expecting much when I ordered this because it was so inexpensive.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It's not cheap quality.  It hangs beautifully and even has a little weight in the front of the neckline so it lies properly in front.
B00LW4QX2M|5|nice quality, my grandson loves them.
B005KME2YS|5|If you're an SOA fan AND you're Irish this is just a cool shirt. Got it for St. Patty's but didn't wear it, it's not really that kind of \\"festive\\". My BF typically wears an XL and this one fit just right. No complaints.
B00GBVOMQ0|3|This is not a light yellow shirt, but more of a highlighter yellow.  The image is not correct.
B0002FHI6W|3|Nice shirt but it is really long.  Length from shoulder to bottom for a &#34;Large&#34; is 31&#34;.  I have a Fruit of the Loom same style, same size and it is 25&#34;.  Way too long.  I had to return.
B006QN6068|4|The gloves are very soft on the inside and the outside. Because they are Columbia, I expected them to be more thick, warm and insulated.  They just seem like a casual pair of gloves you wear to prevent chapped skin.  Where I am from, it's cold. These will not keep my finger tips from freezing during the zero and below weather.  They would, of course, work walking back and forth from a car and a building, but not for a dog walk or nature walk on a freezing day.  I purchased the medium size.  My hand measure 6 3/4 from wrist to middle finger tip, and the medium felt good for me. There is some room for my hands to breathe. I do not want tight gloves, though I would suspect I could wear a size small.
B001HNSCKE|2|Not at all what I was expecting.  Looked cheap and was huge on me.  Returned.
B005I34BZE|4|These are great gloves for using on my bicycle, but I thought they'd be a bit warmer. I bought a pair of undergloves to compensate for their lack of warmth. Even with those they don't retain warmth. However, everything else about these gloves I love, light, flexible, and they keep my hands from being chapped.
B00NPLEUG6|5|They run bigger then I expected, the size chart said 7 but I should have gotten a 6. They are super cute he will wear them next year
B006NUNMTM|1|The top fits great. The pants...well, they don't even touch his waist they are so big. The length is fine but when I pick him up they fall off.
B00K0R7TY8|5|Cute shirt! Great quality. Boris Karloff is a babe.
B006WSO51O|5|This dress is very flattering on, it is a soft knit jersey so it is comfortable too and it has a stretchy waste.
B004G7ZKO4|5|great t shirt
B00I4FTM5C|1|I'm a little disappointed because I thought this was supposed to fit a 5C which it doesn't so I can't use it for my phone :(<br />I'm currently trying to sell it AS IT SHOULD BE ADVERTISED, the SQUARED SHAPED iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S, not the CURVED 5C<br />Really sad because it is SO CUTE and exactly what I was looking for
B00BRDCRGO|5|They fit my husband nicely and he says they are very comfy.
B00EIYWAAW|5|Soft.  Warm.  Comfortable.  Warm. Soft.  Waist belt of good construction.  But not the Flannel I am used to. More thin than a medium weight.  All in all, they met my expectations and I wear them all the time.  No flaws discovered after washing.  Seams are well done. No hanging threads.<br /><br />Arrived on time and packaged in two plastic bags. I will buy again.
B00OJP7ZSW|4|LOVE LOVE LOVE this skirt.  I am a size 14/16 and I bought the extra large.  It fit true to size.  The material is nice and breathable.  You can move easily and it fit like a glove.  If you have curves or not it looks fantastic.  I am going to buy different colors.  A must in your wardrobe. You can wear to work, store, or weekend trips.
B000NL2S10|2|It's not pink, it's more of a dull red.  The worst part is when the emergency lights (almost the same color) go on in the ISS you are practically invisible.  Vyacheslav told me that I couldn't wear it back the next time, for safety reasons.  Right, like there are a lot of other space stations I can wear it on.  I was going to give it one star just for that, but it gets two because the air connector is really easy to disconnect.
B003OLXPMW|5|I ordered a 5X bases on the reviews. I'm glad I did! It is perfect! The length is a really short dress and I it covers everything it needs to when I wear leggings. I want to order them in every color!
B000U0DH8C|5|Perfect for protecting your hands from sun damage while driving.  Comfortable, easy to put on / take off!
B009EE9D6U|5|I bought this bodysuit for a Black Cat cosplay I'm going to be doing soon, if you don't know the character she's from the Spider-Man comics.<br /><br />I mention the character because the suit she wears is VERY tight and sexy and this item definitely works for that! It was a LITTLE bit bigger than I wanted in the back of my waist and on my knees, but that's just my personal taste, I altered it myself and now it's like a second skin. It DID look great before altering it! I'm a petite girl: 5'1 and 106 lbs, so my case is probably an exception. The fabric is not super high quality material, but it's very nice for the price.<br /><br />This would probably fit perfectly on a woman slightly taller than me, but I'm not entirely sure about someone who is over 5'5-5'6. All in all, I seriously have to say it looks great, it's comfortable and very sexy.
B00J501LQI|5|Very well made casual capris. Love the way it looks and fits.
B00K67L8QC|3|Very cute but I felt that the crotch area hung a little low on me. I would have preferred if they sold it by sex so the cut would be better for a female.
B000XYCHHC|4|This is one of the best EMT pants I have had. It is very comfortable, affordable and really nice fit for a female. I ordered my regular jean size (6) and it fit me perfectly. ( ignore the size chart: it was way overestimated and said that I should order size 10 or 12.) The pant is unhemmed so you may need to do some work on it. But nevertheless it worth it. The only problem I had was the color of the pants. I ordered both Black and Midnight blue. But Midnight blue does not look any different than black color. I was hoping it would be much closer to a blue color. Overall it is a great deal with a great look!
B0050JHRYI|5|Jacket is an exact fit, material is stain proof and good quality
B00OQW0ZXK|5|Good
B00I94JCVM|2|Runs small.
B006VXEFQA|5|I love this onsie. It is durable and best of all, the size is roomy. I have a bigger one year old, who I stopped putting in onsies because even when I would buy the right size, they were too tight. This onsie is not only thick and comfy, the size is roomy enough that I feel comfortable ordering 5 or so more. (She has gone from 9 mos size to 18 mos in less than four months, so purchasing clothes to keep up with her has been a struggle)They are also priced right!
B004OVDJ9K|5|This jacket is great.  I paid $36 at Amazon.  Great for semi-formal and formal events.  My son looked very dapper in his khaki pants and blue blazer.
B00YOLV3Z2|5|A lil smaller , but I love this shirt😍 !!!
B00I4CP0VA|1|Bought the shirt....used it twice...washed it twice...NEVER dryed in dryer...image and letters started peeling off.
B00V8ZIEWW|5|I was surprised at the quality of this shirt. very nice
B007GD2O30|5|I am wearing this over a shirt during my pregnancy so that I can still look somewhat professional wearing scrubs. I love that it has snaps so I can wear it undone as my belly grows.
B0039X40MY|5|Any clothing item that is still made in the USA generally gets 5 star review from me.  This belt is nice and is made in the USA.
B010MJ17XC|5|I recived this dress at a discount  price for my honest  review. The fabric on this dress i comfotable. It is to long for me i am 5 2. So it would need hemed for short people. This dress is very comfortable  it isnt  see through like some maxi dresses  are so that is a plus aboit this one.thos dress shows lots of clevage so if you dont like your clevage hanging  out then it isnt  for you.
B000FBKJMS|2|This top was not very comfortable...I found the fabric rough and unforgiving. I'm used to Grey's Anatomy scrubs which are so soft, and this top just wasn't cutting. The money I saved buying this top was not worth the discomfort in something I'd be wearing 40 hours a week. So I returned them. Maybe after a few washes they'd soften up, but didn't want to take my chances. I'm 5'6, 105lbs and I found the XS top to be quite large with sleeves nearly down to my elbows. Just wasn't a great fit for me...I returned.
B00N6S1P1G|1|Runs small and the fabric was thinner than the other colors I ordered
B00L40XXG8|4|These are well constructed capris and they have a nice sheen to them.  I like how they fit at the waist, not too low and not to high. The sizing seems to be about as expected.  The only reason that I deducted one star is my pet peeve with a lot of jeans and pants.  The fit seems to be made for women with more boyish figures.  I have a curvy figure, not meaning fat, just I have the curve in at the waist - the traditional hourglass.  I normally wear either a 4 or 6 in pants.  In these capris, the 6 fit perfectly in length and through the hips, but I had about a 2.5 in gap at the waist.  If I bought them to fit my waist, they wouldn't go around my hips.  I really don't like gaps in the waist.  So, if you have an hourglass figure, you might want to take that into consideration.  You might need to have them altered.  If you have less of a difference in your hips and waist, this would be a great option.
B00LKG8VIQ|5|I love the style of this clothing brand but I was skeptical about the sizing barrier. I decided to wing it and order anyway. I ordered and it took over a month for it to arrive. I ordered the shirt 2x and it fits me exactly like it fits the model wearing it in the picture. I'm 6'1&#34; and I'm about 180 lbs. I usually buy a medium in U.S. sizing so order about 2 sizes bigger than you would normally would if you're referring to the U.S. sizing chart. The shirt is also high quality material and very well made. I plan on ordering more in the future and I hope this review gives you an idea of what size to order, so you're just not blindly ordering.
B000UPVCPW|4|Well worth the price! Material is soft and has give, but not too much. Be comfortable and sexy at the same time.
B00SI03EDE|5|Super comfortable and not see through!  Great quality
B0017SKHCU|5|Love It
B00HIFP492|5|They are perfect, the color is modern, the size is accurate to the that i asked, the package arrived timely and without problems, I recommend the product.
B00JEXH8KO|5|I bought seven of these tops from Asia and I am really happy with all of them.<br />Bought through Amazon, of course....<br /><br />They only took not even a week more than any national delivery.<br />They look exactly like the pictures.  They are by no means THAT sheer.<br /><br />Most importantly, they fit perfectly, because we were warned to<br />BUY LARGER<br />by all of you who purchased at the beginning.<br /><br />THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
B007T27LT0|5|These shorts fit perfectly and looks and feels like quality shorts.  I am 5'10'' 215 lbs and it looks great on me.  Not too baggy or tight.
B00836M5EM|5|Good
B00741CAWO|5|I bought this belt primarily because I was tired of my belts cracking on the hole that I regularly use. This belt looks good, and I honestly think this is going to last me until the day I die (assuming I don't get larger than a 42 inch waist). I love the fact that I can cinch it up to any position I would like, rather than having to go to the next available hole. I will definitely be getting this belt in more colors in the future.
B00PJAHZB8|5|I LOVE  MY NEW JACKET.... IT'S Very Stylish. ..
B000IBLJF6|5|Electric socks not needed. If it's not that cold, don't wear these. I found that if it wasn't windy or freezing. My feet became to warm. I just doubled up on regular socks on the sunny days above 40F. One pair under my thermals, and the other over. They do offer different temp ratings on winter socks. Awesome product.
B006ZOVPYA|3|Nice and big and roomy for a size large. Big Big Downer is No pockets on these come on Man got to have pockets!!
B00DOJCOOO|2|very flimsy material. Sizes run very small.
B00KW4ZBG2|1|Soooo small
B003EHWMAC|2|Lots of loose strings inside the gloves fingers made it hard to get them on, they hung up on my nails.
B009ZTT80K|4|I'm an easy 5 in these jeans, but in all (I mean ALL) other brands I wear a 7 or 9.<br /><br />I love these because they're a 5...but I know it's just vanity-sizing.<br /><br />They are cute.<br /><br />Don't put them in the dryer, or the pockets will turn inside-out on the edges.  Even if you don't put them in the dryer it takes a minute to straighten them out....
B00W6AY7G0|5|Perfect!
B009DQPEJE|3|The shirt is soft to the touch and very pretty. I will enjoy wearing it on causal days for work and play.
B00AHCJVEC|5|Good fit and finish. Tough material should wear a very long time. Mates with tee's or collared shirts of any color.
B001763KOY|5|Seller (Grim Reaper) was super fast with shipping! Wig itself was just what I needed for Halloween.
