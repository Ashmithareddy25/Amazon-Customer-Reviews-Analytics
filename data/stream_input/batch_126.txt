B007HOGOFW|5|Good light weight Lock.
B00Q31MGVG|5|Worked great lined up perfect
B000CRKONY|5|Very good wipers and easy to install.
B005508OLW|5|Extremely happy with this purchase. Got many compliments.
B000KYT6KQ|5|FOLLOW JARED & KRISTINA AINSWORTH'S DIRECTIONS. I am happy with my purchase. I had ZERO trouble by starting out using the directions given by Jared Ainsworth.  The only thing I found to be useful with the given directions was the steps to turn on/off the chirp when locking/unlocking were correct. Other than that you get what you pay for if you follow these steps 1: unlock all doors 2: open & close drivers door 3: cycle key in the ignition from off to on (without starting the engine) 10 times ending in the off position. 4: you should hear a beep of the horn (if you dont,start over) once you do press any button on remote. You should be done. You can chose to turn the chirp on or off by unlocking all doors and then pressing both buttons on remote for a few seconds. Repeat to turn off. ( done on a Subaru Impreza Outback Sport 2002)
B00D3QZCIS|4|Best thing I did to my Polaris XP.  if you use your ATV for work like I do, get a set of HD springs both front and back.
B00H29LLWS|5|They preformed fine
B00DNX94E4|1|Terrible phone doesn't fit in it and it's to small to put anything in to
B000COC67E|5|Just the thing for my tired old bones. I wish it would work in the garden!
B009MASZ1K|3|Doesn't fit the 2013 Escape SEL like it should.  It was a good 4 or 5 inches too short to fit the length of the windshield and as a result, wouldn't stay up when put into place.  Not sure why it fit some people's vehicles and not mine, but I guess that's either quality control or I just have a different idea on what &#34;fits&#34; than other people do. Nice quality product, but forty bucks for something that doesn't fit like it is supposed to is not acceptable.  For half that price, I might have made do with it.
B00C7I4PL8|5|Handy litte clips, I use them in my camper to hold the garbage bags in the collapsible can, clip chip bags closed, clip the curtains together when I shut them & on & on.
B00SGJIBZ8|5|Great!
B004T60EV6|5|Awesome!!!!!!!!!
B002Z34U56|2|NFG... This expensive battery charger was purchased 06/18/2014 from Amazon. Control panel read out panel is now missing several numerals at the end of each of its three lines. Its now hard to guess what's working or not. In regards to charging time left or other data. The read out stopped working about a month after the one year warranty ran out..... Another example of China Quality?
B00DCCWFP6|5|Speedometer began jumping erratically and eventually stopped working at which time it set a P0500 code. Changing this VSS and gear took care of the problem and the code has not come back. Thanks for the quick shipping.
B00BSESISI|5|Excellent as always
B0055PD1H4|5|Most effective cleaner for exterior car vinyl
B0091OE6II|2|After placing strap into holder only a few times, will not hold. Strap comes out on its own.
B004RCX25C|5|Was everything it said.  Very satisfied.  No more worry about Carbon Monoxide in our horse trailer.
B00PYQCB4I|1|They didn't fit at all in my Chevy Cobalt! My seats are thinner up top, and the picture looked like they were too but it was misleading. They were also too short and the base was also an inch too wide on each side so I had to get rid of them :(<br />AND I didn't get the instruction book either
B00J5Z1NPC|5|What can I say it's an air filter. I did notice an increase of power after I installed it but that might of been because the filter I had on had 50,000 miles on it. I generally like to change my filter every 6 months but with my car as uncommon as it is it was it was difficult to find an air filter outside of the dealership.
B00E9ANSGU|5|They are very sturdy and used them on the next day after receiving then to start a school bus at my job.
B000IZ2B6S|5|Fit perfectly and all components are of the best caliber.
B00NM361BO|5|excellent helmet fits great and the jet fighter drop down sun visor is awesome. im ride almost everyday that i can and not having to switch shields for night time riding is a big bonus.
B000CIKBY0|1|Did not need part, would not take back.
B00PFLF0M2|5|Bought some LED 1156 bulbs from Aliexpress last September for my reverse lights and checked them recently to find some of the chips had already failed. These JDM bulbs seem to be made to a higher standard and the light is crisp and extremely bright. Will see if they last a year, hope so as the exchange rate ain't to good atm for us Kiwi's
B0056OL7O8|5|As advertised
B00JLV4R2Q|5|Super high quality chain! Only gripe is that black paint on the connecting link was scratched when installed. Might be unavoidable, might have been the cheap-o chain rivet tool I bought on Amazon...
B0087XOTWW|4|very good price and items came in good shape and working as described in details.
B00QTYYKNO|4|Worked fine as described.
B00R6DV1E8|2|After 3 weeks they are curling on some edges. I have bought this brand in the past and they were thicker then. I am not sure how they will hold up now.
B00ZRPCW2M|5|Yes worked perfect.
B00NTI9QMI|5|perfect fit
B00G5WSXBA|5|I've had these seat covers for a little over one year now. They still look like new. I put them on a 2002 F150XL.<br /><br />The seat covers fit snugly, but not super snug. Anoherwords, they didn't need to be stretched for installation. Aside from looking good, they also don't slide around or ever need adjusting.<br /><br />I really like them.
B00SXQFYK4|5|Awesome worth every penny very easy to install
B002303UFW|5|Works and fits like it should.  There isn't much to say about brushes other than that...<br /><br />If your XS650 needs brushes, these are great.
B00OZDC240|5|The stitching is coming a part on the rear section of the car cover.
B000T3AMFG|4|This cover works well. I had the windows down during a rain storm and it kept the water out. I only gave it 4 stars because it is a little short (won't quite fit over front bumper, and as stated by another review, you have to punch a hole it the cover for the antenna.
B000AUREHC|5|Fit perfect now all i need are illumnia shocks
B005OJ3UHC|5|Truck looks great with this new grill. Easy installation
B006BCRNYM|5|whoah! super easy to program!  and WAAAAAY less expensive than the dealership.
B00EZ9Y33W|1|Not so good, wires are great quality, relay is solid. But the switch is dumb. The adhesive on the back is a piss poor excuse for such. And the actual switch seems more like a rattle toy for a small child. It came pre-broken, literally never worked so I had to buy a different switch. Also the color coding for the positive and negative leads for the light fixtures are wrong, they don't match anything. Not such a good product. Not worth what I paid. Wouldn't buy again.
B00X2TUW1I|5|Does exactly what it's supposed to!<br /><br />Fits perfectly on a Acura RDX rear window (SUV), and also a Acura TSX (4 door sedan).
B0049MX8N6|5|This hitch was easy to install. Just follow the instructions and use an impact wrench for the bolts.
B00IUP1KDS|4|I didn't have fog lights in my bumper from the factory so I put these in and you can't tell there weren't ever any there. Bought them and installed about a month ago and while washing the truck yesterday, I noticed that there was moisture inside the lens. Not sure what seal is messed up but I would give 5 stars if I hadn't noticed that leaking.
B003R7HX0I|5|part looked and fit perfect
B004VKXHFA|4|Not the same as the factory filter but seems to work good.
B0033WNNR4|5|Real easy to install. Came with zip strips to tie it up in places to keep it from hanging and all the connections where a breeze to use.
B009W85YTI|3|Smelled weird when I got it, so I washed it. Its good for the money.
B00EJWXFXO|5|New addition to my range box (50 cal big fat can). Great quality!
B00DBENEBE|5|Work great - good product and great price
B00CFQUKTS|4|Satisfied
B001R5D66M|4|perfect match to my 2004 dodge ram 3500.looks and works great. cost me less than having them refinished.
B00F5827DK|4|Good stuff
B00WX5LIU6|4|I am pleased the same net that the dealership had.
B00K5WBQC4|5|They were just as advertised! Just what I wanted! And the seller sent an extra sticker just in case. That was awesome:)
B00496KFTW|4|does what it does
B008W1BF4O|5|Great Product less than half the cost the dealer wanted.
B00WJCNQWG|5|I installed these in my 04 acura tsx and they look great. I also restored my headlights which helped tremendously!!!!!
B003SJLTL4|5|Installed on my 2004 Chevy express 1500 cargo van - these are meant to slip over the axle without removing it... It might be a little difficult slipping it over where as I wound up removing the axles to flush out the rear end. Nice product, I like the coating that's on. Found them the cheapest on Amazon.
B00JXYGSFA|5|Great product, great price, prompt delivery, great job
B00480J50O|1|I bought these in October 2014.  It is now August 2015 and one of the lights has already burned out. I ended up getting pulled over last night because of it!
B00HSR2PVK|2|Good product.
B000XSI96G|5|I do recommend this product. It's well priced and gets the job done. You really do need it if you are going pull and install pulleys on pumps and alternator.
B00C5SUZ7I|3|Float was on backwards, had to use the original float.  Be sure to buy a new lock ring.  I used the pneumatic hammer chisel method listed above to loosen the lock ring.  It wont come all the way off once it loose.  Then use hammer screw driver method to get the rest of the way off.  Sensor itself works fine.
B00KTI9UQ8|4|Programming instructions were worth the price.
B00THH9I7I|4|Good product, exactly as advertised.
B000TYOSFU|5|worked great
B00K0VMXDQ|5|I drive a Jeep Wrangler that has a propensity for the battery to drain when I leave the headlights on. This happened recently, and I had enough of being stranded with jumper cables in a lot waiting for a good Samaritan. I bought the Brightech Scorpion jump starter.<br /><br />The kit from Brightech is impressive. It comes in a nice zipper pack, which is the size of a large book. It contains the battery itself, which as seen in the picture, is smaller in footprint than a large smartphone. There are also a variety of cables to fit a 30pin Apple device, an Apple lightning connector, a micro-USB connector, a variety of DC barrel plugs, cables to recharge the battery via a wall receptacle or a 12 volt automotive plug (cigarette lighter plug). These connectors all plug into the battery via USB ports or a barrel plug on the top of the battery. There is a port on the side of the battery in which you plug the jumper cable clips to jump start your car.<br /><br />The battery itself is simple to use. It has a power button on the top to turn it on (it automatically turns off when it detects no draw), and three LEDs to represent the charge level. There is a small button the top of the battery to cycle through the modes of the flashlight, which are very bright, and has a constant light or several blinker options. The battery came from Amazon showing three LEDs, fully charged. I took it on a trip and used it to charge two phones and a tablet before it showed that it was discharged and required a recharge.<br /><br />I have used this to jump start a lawn mower, and several vehicles, including a 4 cylinder car and a V6 SUV without any trouble.
B00JBICP78|5|Great
B00LY81CAY|5|Not very long but ok
B009RWPOYO|5|Arrived on time and works perfectly.
B000C7WVQW|5|Installed it and it fit great and functioned properly.  After my third used, the knob busted when using the fog lights. Too bad i didnt use is sooner before my return time was over.  I had to keep gluing it back on.<br /><br />Amazon replaced the part for free! Great service!
B00065ZIJ2|5|This lock is very convenient! The lock itself looks very durable and bright. Which allows people to notice there is a steering wheel lock inside.  The best part about this lock is you don't have to unlock it to place it onto your steering wheel. Although if you have a cover on the steering wheel itself,  the lock may be a little hard to get on.
B00EM8RW34|5|Needed an o-ring for my '00 Jeep Cherokee after installing a slip yoke eliminator kit and 4&#34; Old Man Emu lift kit. The original o-ring lasted through the install, but I had to pull the housing to re-install the output seal (leaked horribly!) and it did not survive the swap. I Ordered this and it arrived 2-days (Prime) and slide right on, exactly like the original. No leaks at all, and the rubber had a very nice feel to it. Got two just in case, but very happy with the quality and fit.
B00JXS3BXI|5|Bought two. Love it
B00S9S8NA4|3|By the way did power to TV and computers perfectly fine it would not have enough power to work the microwave
B003ZWJBLE|5|Got here super fast, looks good
B0029V9DRY|4|I actually put this ontop of my pop-up camper.  Worked great.  Only downfall, it is NOT completely waterproof.  It traveled through a downpour, and my luggage arrived wet. :-(
B000MD4YKM|4|Good, solid build on this grease gun.  Cartridge bearing grease installed into tube and grease gun pumps out adequate grease at a rate commensurate with handle action.  The only caveat is to make sure the head is securely tightened onto the tube portion or this gun will leak - not a large amount but enough to realize that it is leaking.
B001FGGU1G|5|Great product, fast shipping no problems with the product, fits my van perfectly, I would buy again.
B007QTCF92|5|Better priced then in town. Ordering more in the future.
B00EUW0G3U|5|Easy to install, Fit my 99 Jeep Wrangler TJ perfectly.  Highly recommend. Great Product!
B00KGGTF9U|5|The shade is exactly what we needed and fills the window of your Nissan Rogue nicely. I'd buy again!
B00CYP8MMC|4|Worked great but did need minor tweaking.
B00U29M6SI|5|This charger is totes. My motorcycle (whose name is Squidward but is also a girl- don't ask me, I find it hard enough just keeping up with her pronouns) was feeling a little unloved, so I installed this charger, as well as a set of BOSS speakers so I can rock out to my Hannah Montana and Spongebob Squarepants holiday albums around town. And it works great! I wave to my neighbors as they envy my hot rod. 'Twas easy to install (even for a non-electrical engineer like me) and now I have the power to charge all the things I want.<br /><br />Serious note- it doesn't have an on/off switch, so unless you want to drain all the power from your battery, you'd either have to install a switch or manually unplug the charger from your battery. I keep unplugging it for now, but I will install a switch on it soon.
B005948W8O|1|Crap. Even if the top would stay on its not waterproof.
B00BUV2QK0|3|the chrome plastic nuts leave a 1/4&#34; gap between the body and the screen, other than that the price is right and quality is great.
B005N73EYE|3|cheap hoodie
B008MM5ZFI|4|i have an older top on my jeep.  it looked almost grey. i applied raggtopp to it and now it looks black again.  This is not a dye.  it restored my top beautifully.  will have to reapply later, but thats ok. Excellent product.
B00J2Z9HLW|5|Good
B00VH8QKF8|5|arrive as described
B00GNHORB2|4|good quality -- easy to hang on a hook -- easy to find in the bottom of your bag.
B008QR1ASK|5|Works great for using in yard and around the garage
B004V9Z02Y|5|Best thing ever!
B00HFHE6KG|5|Perfect fit and exact replacement for the non working one on my car.  Took all of 10 minutes to install.
B00ESUBRY6|5|Product came sooner than expected which made me happy and this dye was amazing on my shoes if you need to reddye or dye your shoes this is a must buy!
B00AAGDEB6|5|Awesome product, I use this on my boat every time we pull it out of the water.
B002M3KSK0|5|Fit good and worked well on my 2007 short wheel base Chrysler Town and Country. Installed i n maybe 10 minutes.
B000JQOKW4|5|Very good  product.
B0081SDEG0|5|Swapped a failed clutch on my son's 2002 Jetta. Clutch was exactly like the OEM. Getting the old one off sucked due to lack of space. I recommend removing the alternator and serpentine belt tensioner!  The new clutch works great.
B00SOH7VCQ|4|Great product all lights worked and were easy to install on my buggy .would have been 5 stars but the wiring is kinda light gauge so connecting is not as easy as it could be . fast shipping tho.
B000FGLQBG|5|Packaged very well and love the size.  This will work great.
B000M5W25E|2|Is not white
B008BLFHS0|5|used on foglight and they  look sexy, i would suggest putting a few layers on to get that deep yellow.
B00BCRM9YA|5|Fast shipping..Easy install..very soft!
B00FC221BC|4|Good stuff
B00FLNKVYQ|5|Same quality as the higher priced ones, but nice for the pocketbook
B00RIVNP1K|5|Just as good as original equiptment. Much cheaper!
B001FANRAO|1|Giving one-star because it does not fit 1985 CJ-7. Part is too large in diameter for cutout. Part seems well enough made, however.
B003LT619Q|5|Easy install. Works perfectly right out of the box. Used the factory preset adjustment setting.
B001F1W5BU|5|My Butt loves it.
B00TQZUDUC|5|Exactly as described.
B00M0M2SEM|5|This is a handy addition to the Husky 5th wheel hitch. This is the roller part only. It installed in less the a half hour. Easy to operate.
B00K53BM0E|5|Quick delivery with no special handling requirements. Charged quickly and maintains charge well.
B00PNKGL1O|1|I ordered it for an 07 Gsxr but the one I got was for an 02
B00NOEXSSK|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B0002UEMYS|5|just love it for my flats boat.
B000BZZR34|5|perfect OEM replacement rotor at low cost.
B006B7YJZ8|4|It looks nice and was so easy to install. I was a little hesitant to install before I checked it. I love the way it sounds in my car.
B0096T72OI|4|Making good use of it
B00LG07MZE|1|This is NOT a jumbo windshield sunshade; extremely disappointed.
B00B27KM12|5|Very nice, stylish and affordable!
B005H7D7TM|5|This was the OEM part and it worked perfectly
B007Y8XZ58|5|Awesome B2B comms kit, works like a champ. My wife and I ride Road Kings and we like to talk to each other. Works still at speeds of 80 MPH+ (large windshield). Easy to install, long lasting battery, and we haven't even tried the integration of a mobile phone yet. We love it, makes the ride a really joined experience. Must have if you ride together ! Make sure you get the half helmet kit if you have a half helmet, so you can use your own ear buds !!!
B001NZQIFM|5|Great product
B00N18WWN6|1|Did not fit my car as stated in information. Honda Accord 2013
B002I9OQGK|5|Just what I expected.
B0074EJ8PI|5|Just as described and arrived promptly.
B00DKEUMX8|2|I didn't pay attention to the description. It's 2&#34; wide super small. With the price and pic, I assumed it was regular size. Not good size for the price at all.
B000CPJMY8|5|Enough to do both wheel bearing changes. Great grease and since it is bright blue, very easy to clean up and remove excess grease.
B004X973EA|5|works wonders,better shifting
B000F17S0E|5|Fit perfectly.  Really makes a difference by reducing heat from the sun off the dash.
B00AJZ61G8|5|Used a hacksaw blade to cut out the button template.  Sturdy.  Just be aware that you will have to use something to snug in the stereo.  Try foam from a laptop or computer box.
B00ID2VVUA|5|Easy to install. Very bright.
B0067UAUA2|5|Timely and as advertised.
B00MIPT326|1|no Works for HHR . size different
B002SVHD0O|5|Received on schedule. They fit perfectly, replacing my broken fan knob. I bought two so I would have an extra one in case I needed to replace any of the other knobs. My Jeep Wrangler TJ is a 2003. I would recommend
B00QRHDIPY|5|Great purchase. Works as advertised
B00MEVO5U4|5|Got these months ago. They are still on my car and still look brand New. I love them
B00CC3XPZK|5|Not one complaint since installed.
B000GTYBUK|5|This cable worked perfectly on a Harley Davidson Road King.
B00O2IQPK0|5|These fit the &#34;J&#34; hook wiper arms on my Ranger very well (18&#34;).  They sweep back and forth smoothly without any chatter, leaving no streaks.  They seem to be well constructed.  I expect them to last longer than the conventional rubber refills I've been using.
B00QXTZ5RU|5|fits my 1995 F250 longbed diesel truck perfectly against the horrible triple digit temperature here in southwestern Arizona
B000S34NG6|4|GOOD
B000B69V2Q|1|Broke the same way as my 15 year old factory part did.  However this one I opened my tailgate only twice before it broke.<br /><br />It's a bad design with the lever that releases the drivers side latch.  Returned.
B009UOVXIU|5|This fits the rear passenger door of my 2008 Mercury Mariner Hybrid perfectly.  It is an OEM part so it was identical to the factory part.  It was pretty easy to install and works great.  It includes the motor as well.
B007CTQKVU|5|they were very easy to change out and fit perfectly
B0031I2Z9C|1|Got the alternator and it looked new. when to a parts store and got it tested, it passed the test. installed it in my car and its working good for about 3 months. Started making a noise this morning. Went out to eat and car died in line of the drive through. Money well spent.
B00SWPEAX8|5|Easy to install; works fine.
B00KGGTF9U|5|Perfect sunshade! Complete windshield coverage! Came back and bought another for my family member!
B000FW4LT4|5|these are outstanding, after a couple of years I did snap a handle on one of the 2 I ordered, but in fairness I did something dumb and put pressure on it from a weird angle.  The blade is super good at taking ice off your windows without scratching them.
B00I1ASD96|4|Nice led for this car. I am satisfied.
B0002SA43S|4|I like the way it looks and work. Only one problem  that I have is I wish the back attached  better with i
B00JIEX722|5|Lights are really bright
B004303LMC|4|I used this to dye a burgundy cross body bag.  I used several applications (also a primer and finisher).  There was a bit of rub off for a while- but once I throughly wiped it several times with saddle soap- it was great.  Would definitely recommend.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Very good protector! Love it!
B004BT6N8Y|1|same review with the other pair. This wiper has no base for the j hook. Unacceptable!!! On the process of installing it I even accidentally cracked my windshield because the wiper arm sprung back and the metal arm hit the glass!!! Had a horrible day because of theses wipers. I'll give it a zero I could. Now I have to pay and replace my windshield!!!. I ended up buying a pair of rain x wipers and installation was so easy. I still have a cracked windshield!!!
B002C627VU|5|Received the decal nicely packaged and exactly as advertised!!  Easy to apply and is the perfect size for my rear window on a '12 Miata PRHT.  Lots of compliments.
B00JG7W8Y4|5|Great replacement for brake lines rusting up from road salt - Forms flares well and bends easily without kinking with standard bending tools. More costly than part store steel but well worth it
B000C7VY9M|5|Great upgrade to my original 1999 7.3 PSD radiator.  My original radiator didn't have the Oil to Water cooler on the bottom.  My tranny temps were WAY higher than they should have been (had the original tiny 7.3 tranny cooler also).  Upgraded to this Radiator as well as the Dorman 918-216 tranny cooler and my Tranny temps dropped from 260 degrees down to 163 degrees (towing a 11k lb travel trailer).  Install was really easy with this radiator, and I HIGHLY recommend it.<br />Check the size of your original Tranny Cooler lines.  Mine were 3/8 inch and the threaded connectors to this Radiator are 1/2.  Had to find some 3/8 - 1/2 hose barbs.  Took my forever to find the right ones, but they were only about $5 a piece at the local auto parts store (when I finally found a store that had some).
B012CGZTAA|1|Already experiencing connection issues, BUMMER! i had hopes this thing was at least stable. performs ok for connection speed etc, about average. I had the large BAFX one, and it worked nearly the same minus being disconnected every few minutes. Ill try it out for a day more and if no improvement its going back. i might look into the OBDLINK one if this continues to be flakey
B00XXD32R4|1|I received these pucks for my 2000 C5 Corvette.  They did pop in fairly easily but they DO NOT seat tight against the frame so they all rattle around when you drive the car.  They were swiftly returned and I will purchase another brand that does not lock in and I will install them when they are needed.
B0000AYD4H|5|Nice quality carpet. Covered bunks very easily.  Good product
B00ZRPLY30|5|Got here very fast , great quality , very cute ! Thank you so much!
B000E3BVSS|5|Just as described. Arrived when promised. Great quality. When I need new ones,  I'll order these again.
B00KNBD3XW|5|This works great no more sloppy drain hose this is so neat And clean it does take longer to drain that's the only negative I still give it five stars I recommend the clear adapter so you can view what is going on
B00C7FO78C|5|Got mine and they look exactly  like the picture im happy with them thank you: )
B00943S48E|5|necessary if you going to buy body parts for the car....
B000COTWZ8|4|Delivered quickly and fit perfectly.
B000AME4VE|5|This has been a wonderful trash bag for out car and the strap keeps it on place wherever we choose to hang it from.
B00D96TWC4|5|love my butterflies---
B002OPPDHO|3|Excelente part
B00N4ZT5A4|5|Great product
B0036UXIPA|5|as advertised
B00UIV5DGW|5|Very good thanks for my lights
B006N91BLY|5|Great price on a high capacity AGM battery.  Fitment was good.  I hope it hold up to ACDelco's great reputation.
B00029KA7C|4|PLEASE WITH THE PRODUCT.
B007XZJZ6U|1|Misleading said door handles got door handle covers.
B00COYZUP0|3|They only mount to the inner rockers making them very spongy on my 2013 Ram. I don't think the finish would hold up very well either. Quick delivery and easy return.
B00SVRHD22|4|pretty good
B00A3UNYW8|5|Great tool that is needed when rotating wheels and tires on a later model GM vehicle!  I have used in on our 2012 Impala and 2011 Silverado.
B00G4S1G0K|5|It was as described and did nicely for touch ups on my 2014 Lexus IS250.
B00067V0PQ|5|A quality good looking wheel! Thanks to the 2&#34; horn button there are several aftermarket horn button inserts. I was able to find one with a correct year specific Corvette emblem horn button. It makes the steering wheel look like a factory option. An option that is much better looking than the factory wheel. Works nice with the telescopic adapter.<br />1/18/16, The steering wheel actually makes the car more fun to drive. Very comfortable.
B011Q18D14|5|Arrived in good packaging and didn't have any problems getting it to work. There was some condensation under the display though but it didn't seem to effect the way the scanner worked.
B005VKLGUW|5|Perfect for my needs!
B00JEQLIWK|3|[[VIDEOID:686a66e1b060238d909e76e8bf6ee228]]Roughly okay. I would have rated this a lot higher, but for the unfortunate turn of events, I had to give it 3 stars for the alright quality, but really s***ty service.    Let's go over it. I ordered this and as usual per all prime orders, it arrived on time, even earlier than I expected, which was a very pleasant surprise. Delighted, I opened it and was very excited to play with my new toys. When I took out the helmet, I was surprised at how light it was. I've owned only 2 other helmets before, one of which got test crashed twice and had to give up and the other I still have. Both helmets were pretty heavy, in terms of having a huge protective bowl over my head, but extremely durable. When I took this one out, I was delighted at the weight, but skeptical on how protective it would offer me. Anyway, took it out, inspected it. Everything looked fine. The bluetooth component looked like it was put on very whimsically, but I thought nothing of it at the time.    Unable to contain myself, I shoved the helmet onto my head and boy, was I amazed. The cushion inside was EXTREMELY comfortable. And I mean EXTREMELY comfortable. I fell in love with instantly. I did not even want to take it off. There's this weird button and if you push on it, the dark visor pops down. That was extremely cool, I've never had a helmet like that before. And pushing a different part of the button will make it rise. The visor is easy to use, even with bulky motorcycle gloves. It retracts into and from the helmet itself, which to me, is a little on the dangerous side if you crashed it, it would prove to be all kinds of a fatality. And then, on closer inspection of the material of the helmet, the inner protection of the helmet is some durable styrofoam, which is probably why the helmet is so light. Unfortunately, though, there was a weird smell in it. The smell of new equipment, probably the styrofoam. Almost like the smell of a new car. It burned my nose alittle, and it was giving me a headache, so I had to take it off and air it out for about a day. After that, it was still a little smelly, but bearable.    I tested the bluetooth on several occasions, with music and on the phone with another person: in a room, on my bike, riding my bike, and riding my bike on the freeway at about 70-75 mph.    In a room: Music is crystal clear and loud. Conversation on the phone is crystal clear. The person on the other side says it doesn't echo and says that it sounds like I have the phone to my ear.  On my bike (idle): Music is still crystal clear. Had to probably adjust the knob a little to make it louder. Conversations on the phone was also the same and the person at the other end said it was no different and can hear me clearly.  Riding my bike (down a street, roughly 20-35mph): Music gets a little muffled, so I had to adjust the knob. The knob is very tricky. At a touch, the volume changes dramatically, until I actually turn it to adjust the volume. And most of the time, the volume toggles from super soft to extremely loud (this only happens as I ride, probably because I have gloves on and because I'm riding). Conversation on the phone is pretty much the same. Although I had to adjust the volume so that I could hear the other person over the sound of the wind/traffic, which is generally a pain, considering how the controls are so sensitive.  Riding my bike on the freeway (roughly 70-75mph): Music still gets tricky now. The knob, which is VERY sensitive, adjusts the volume, AT THE TOUCH OF THE WIND. How annoying is that. It is a very mild change in volume, but still annoying, because YOU have to readjust it. Conversation with the other person is still pretty much the same, on their end, which is a pleasant surprise. The person on the other end says that it really sounds like I just have the phone to my ear and that I'm not on a bike or a tunnel, except maybe that I'm yelling a lot, because I cannot hear myself talk. However, if I just talk normally or whisper, they can hear me PERFECTLY fine, which is crazy good. On my end, though, it gets a little tricky. Over the wind, I cannot hear them talking, unless I have the volume way up. And you know how your phone picks up weird ticks and knocks near your microphone? I can hear that on full volume in my helmet, and your voice is like a whisper, if you are not speaking clearly on the mic to me, or if you have me on speaker. But all in all, I guess the important thing is that those on the other end can hear you. The sound in the helmet echoes some at full volume and the speakers get that crackly sound.    The vents on the helmet are okay. Not great, but could be better. The ones on top of the helmet will make a significant change in wind volume. If you have them open and riding, the wind is really loud, but if you have it closed, there is a significant volume change from the wind. The visor does fog up, but if you have the dark visor down and the outer one up, it doesn't fog up so much. Also, the helmet is very aerodynamic, in terms that if you turn your head to check your shoulder, the wind won't try to rip the helmet off of your head, which is cool.    Unfortunately, the bad stuff is that the bluetooth component on the outside of the helmet came loose and was coming off. I only wore the helmet once during the 9 days, that I had it. So I had to return it. On contacting Amazon, who told me to contact the third party seller Cycle Gears, I sent in an email requesting for a refund and a return slips, or at least an exchange. Well, the next day, they sent me back an email, claiming that I cannot return the helmet, due to health and odor issues, which honestly. W..T..F !?!?!? REALLY ?!!? Disappointed, I emailed them again to get a full refund after having to tell them that I DIDN'T wear it and only when I said that, they told me to mail it back to them and I'll get my refund. I had to go through their website to do this, as going through amazon did not work so well. I had to pay the shipping and handling costs, which at that moment, I did not care anymore, I just did not want to deal with it anymore. So after that ordeal, here's a short of it.    Overall, here is the pros and cons:    Pros:  - comfortable inner lining  - visor pops down and up at a push of a button  - bluetooth allows the other ends to hear you clearly, despite riding conditions  - connection to bluetooth was easy and quick to use  - good aerodynamics, and okay wind control    Cons:  - Sound from the speakers are easily manipulated by the touch of the WIND  - Bluetooth component popped out, was glued on rather silly-like  - Volume controls is very tricky  - On and off buttons need to be pressed HARD to be turned on, and especially turned off  - Horrible customer service, if you want to return
B0012WHBSO|5|Works great,
B00ALB7WCM|3|Good part. Have to modification to throdle cable because the top of the old one does not fit new carb
B000C5418K|3|not like old moog products.  for those looking for product of origin, per the es3257 I have delivered 8/2015 its made in china.  Had I know or even thought a moog product would be from there I would have purchased a different trw/proforged/lemforder tie rod for my 850.  That being said the grease cover does seem to be blue polyurethane with removable clips.  No zerk fitting though.
B005XBSFJ4|3|The latch fit and works, but i dont know how long it will work.  You can feel how cheap the metal is it will bend eventually. I would spring and buy the OEM latch
B00A8MOZJC|5|Very good shipping, arrived as advertised
B000VKODIO|4|product works fine
B000WEKQ3K|5|They are wonder full and do a great job. Worth the money for sure and really not that expensive
B00J5XTHWK|4|Worked for a year maybe then stopped. Kind of cheap quality but it was nice for a while
B000CGR47O|4|Perfect fit on 06 Lincoln ls and no brake dust to be seen yet with 3000 miles

B000FJQSY8|4|great product
B00EKPOG10|4|Pretty good product. Fast delivery and may seem cheap once you see the packaging, but overall they are very bright and easy to install.
B002UC16QI|1|Valve popped off a few hours after I installed it, you get what you pay for I guess. Water everywhere. I would not recommend this item.
B00CUEE06O|5|hard to put on but they work
B0042KOL9K|5|Great buffer
B002MGFKNW|1|Look good on the trailer but it cannot support the weight of bikes immediately fell upon travel.
B00KMH310C|3|Great piece to add for a straight  threw loud sound. Unfortunately in pa. Buy law they won't install it.but you can take it upon yourself to put it on.just take it off for inspection couse you won't pass.personally I left mine off couse I like the deep sound not loud rice sound.also an intake would help too.witch I already had installed.three stars only couse I got stuck with the test pipe I cant use or I would've gave it a five.nothing wrong with it.it does it's job. Pacesetter is the way to go if you dont want any problem down the road. You get what you pay for.
B005IHAPBY|3|Came as described, only issue I have is it didn't come with screws & the cover parts wouldn't fit over my existing screws so I had to buy new. I also bought some foam to make sure it didn't scratch my paint.
B0061S6OEQ|5|Exactly as described.  Great fit.
B000GU7E0I|5|right product
B007VR7PMQ|5|THIS WIRE SET IS GREAT BECAUSE ITS  PERFECT FIT . 1996 K1500 SUBURBAN 5.7 FAST SHIPPING 2 DAYS
B00DX89368|5|Great product
B0082GN80S|1|The people who gave these five stars must have had to weld, re-drill, and re-tap the valve cover bolt holes in their heads in order for these to fit properly. Look closely at the pics and compare them to other suppliers - the main body of the covers are angled: they should be 90-degrees from the valve cover mounting surface... these are not. Needless to say, they do not fit properly. I have Edelbrock Victor heads which I can safely assume have the same valve cover bolt angle as factory heads: 90-degrees from the mounting surface.  Looks like I'll have to try to return them - fun, fun!
B007BL4VVU|5|Product was excellent, fit for purpose, well packed for long distance transportation. Delivered on time. Super.
B001GJ3E2K|5|Bristles are soft yet strong enough to clean the dirt off your tires and rims. Comfortable arched handle with a rubberized grip to avoid slips while cleaning.
B0095ZLGFO|5|Nice wash, smells good as well
B0051SUMJA|5|Nice product. Thanks
B006OP3IHM|5|dad loved it
B0070Y34Q6|5|Thank you. Item is as described.
B008A0GKWE|5|A great license plate light,i can see them shining past my 07  chevy pu bumper to the sides of the road.
B00266Z8LW|1|I tried to replace it for h11 regular sylvania headlights, they didnt even light up. I guess it is not compatible with my car. Or not a good replacement for h11 as it is advertised.
B00NOKPPK8|5|great light
B007Y85O3O|5|Exactly as advertised & arrived on time......
B00F9LPL5E|5|For those of us in the motorcycle industry that race, in my case drag racing, weight is a major factor in every decision we make. I was a little skeptical when I reviewed this battery because it never comes up in conversations of a good light weight battery. Other manufacturers of course do. Because the other guys couldn't get me their product in time for a race due to manufacturing delays I was forced to source a battery elsewhere. This battery seems to perform as well as the other guys and is just as light weight. I will check back in a few months and re-rate this product and update it's performance but until then I will stay positive and pleasantly surprised.
B00CIJ8DOQ|5|Love how it looks on my H2. Gives it that extra chrome look.
B006J6OQJ0|2|Claims to fit a 2010 Chevy Malibu.  It does not completely cover the steering wheel leaving the grip open in the back.  Due to this, the provided wax string is not long enough to completely tie the steering wheel cover on.
B00BHT7AT2|5|Traveling in Germany right now and this Garmin GPS works great.  I am very happy with it !
B00RV83UUG|5|very happy with this product. I did take it apart and seal it as recommended by other consumers. this light for the size is very bright.
B00NX8EYFI|4|fine size i like it
B00JYJ86MC|3|Made very flimsey. The tin part in the middle holding the window together bends very easily. We are going to have to replace with stronger metal.
B006B2YI6S|5|Perfect fit, love it!
B00NLMQEDG|4|Miata MX-5 Cover (CC-341-S_MazdaMiataMXCJ).  It fit our 2011 SE PRHT MX-5 much better than I thought it would.  I would say the fit is actually good.  Pay attention to the label that marks the front end of the cover.  Our cover is basically used as a dust cover when the car is parked in the garage so I don't know how it would hold up outside in the sun and rain.
B0017K69MA|5|nice to reach in the back window
B0009TUGUG|4|Perfect fit for the little cover that is so easy to break on these lights.  Expensive for what it is, but still cheaper than buying a whole new light.
B000X20JKG|5|Perfect fit
B00122EENE|5|The review on here by &#34;Joe&#34; was 100% correct. I tried a less expensive sensor ($38) that was supposed to work, but it turned on the Check Engine light. I ordered this DENSO 234-9017 sensor and it worked perfectly.  The vehicle is a 2005 Honda Civic EX 2dr. Automatic with the 4cyl. 1.7L V-TEC engine.  P.S. There were no real part numbers stamped on the DENSO sensor. It did arrive in a Denso box and was sealed inside a clear plastic bag with 234-9017 stamped on the outside.
B00FH41ROC|5|For the price it's excellent with no obvious shortcomings other than weight. I have the previous model, the CL-16, and this is much improved. Better fit and less wind noise, and the ventilation is excellent (a weak spot of the CL-16). I find it easy to open and close the face shield also.
B000COVX3C|1|Were pretty weak when I installed them but they did work. 5 weeks later the tail gate is already falling closed. Just outside the Amazon 30 day return window. Quality is pretty bad on these too, the ends are all plastic and look very fragile.<br /><br />Not recommended! Still looking for a quality unit.
B004BZYKWO|4|Came on time and worked as it should have!
B00EEEB77I|5|Used it in Rome on a 100 degree day.  It was a godsend keeping me significantly cooler than without.
B002YM13U8|5|I truly believe in them. I live in heavy deer country and they work for me!!!!
B00471QLME|5|excellent idea to put a locking feature on these caps, I lost count as to how many we're stolen from my car
B0050EH4EG|3|We really loved this ice maker, but after a years  use it quit working.  Not sure what happened.  Lights are working and looks like it is working but no longer makes ice.  If anyone else has had this problem and knows how to repair, let us know.
B00CLBTHJ6|1|Took forever with delivery<br />Used them one time and they kept getting in way of belt rolling back up cheap quality<br />Now they sitting in my trunk
B00RIU09C4|5|GOOD QUALITY PRODUCT IT WAS WORTH THE PRICE CONSIDERING MY DRINKS WERE NOT SPILLING.
B000C9TB9A|5|It fits perfectly on 2001 Miata. The car is running. I wouldn't know how to evaluate the performance of this product.
B003CWB0A2|5|Very happy with this cover; fits like a glove
B0006Z9ST8|5|Worked perfect, very satisfied
B008O0ZIR8|4|Nice decal. Nothing fancy, but will work perfectly on a wall in my kid's bedroom. Colors are bright and the star is straight (someone else posted that their star was crooked). Fast shipping!
B00CTUSEMU|5|Quality Brand. Excellent
B00ELHNGRM|5|right oil for my cars and delivered with prime subscription so I change the oil on time.
B0010Z4MDK|5|Shipped promptly, arrived in perfect condition, relatively easy to install.  No complaints.
B00VLF9MD4|5|Fit as it should, best price on the internet. Used on my 1970 Monte Carlo.
B008CE0LD2|5|Easy to assemble, very solid, good safety reflectors on the back. Watch that your exhaust pipe does not aim directly at it.
B00AZOWSJM|5|Shipped on time and in good packaging.  It's installed and works fine.  Not to sure about the plastic simulated to look like a metal hose though.  I'll probably put the original white hose back on as it does't look as cheesy.
B003NU0EM8|1|Quick shipping, however I tried to get this to work on a normal flat surface and if still didn't latch let alone the are with the dent.
B00MOYJ0YW|5|Love these LED replacements! Makes my new truck more appealing. Easy to install and works flawlessly
B00S4HHVLW|5|easy to install
B002MWU9J6|5|I made the perfect choice when I selected and purchased this vest!  Very comfortable and sturdy.  Sizing is smaller than normal so order 2 sizes larger than your normal size.
B00EZUL6ZY|5|Product arrive days earlier and was exactly as described. A great value for the price!
B004FKYBU6|5|Love it.
B0096EA4XE|4|Bolted right up and worked shipping was questionable pretty beat up
B00OQ1F7PM|3|This unit will charge to 12.6 volts.  Mine has never said or displayed that it is fully charged.  I'm not sure if it is working properly.
B00KDOIEP6|4|Overall happy with the product, but after having them installed for a couple of weeks( installed same time as my HID headlight kit), one of bulbs has already burned  out.
B003EOVOD6|5|great fit thank you
B00HAP8S2K|5|Fits right, looks great, showed up on time.
B005FWWUNS|5|Nice item.  Works good, but the voltage sensor is too sensitive.  I will put a capacitor across the leads and it should desensitize the voltmeter.  The display has no way to change the contrast, but I found that if I tilted it by 45 degrees it was readable.  I am happy for what I paid.  the buttons are cheesy...
B004GC3QEK|4|Color is a little light but is good
B00PE59KLG|5|I love this frame! Durable and noticeable.
B003LIZ166|2|good glasses
B000BQQMSC|5|These mats fit my '04 Ranger XLT very well.  They are made of heavy material with a pattern of strong ribs and rim, which keep dirt, rocks, and general muck contained and easily emptied.  I expect that they'll be great at containing snow, slush, and water when Winter arrives.<br /><br />I would buy these mats again in a heartbeat!<br /><br />One note: Though the fit is very good, it is not a mat custom made for the Ranger.  That being said, I'd rate the fit at 95/100, and that suits me just fine.  Well worth the price.
B0009MZI4M|2|Did not work!
B008G3KA8A|5|Fits and looks great
B00HG76A9A|5|Great Oil
B001EY15D2|5|Perfect fit
B004QJH91E|5|Did the job with no leaks. It's noisy, but it works.
B000B6CVZU|5|Works, that is all I could ask for.
B00449NM58|2|wrong part
B0085XV9JA|1|I was looking for something a little larger.
B00068Y9KI|5|fits perfect...took a long time to arrive, didn't need it sooner, but wondered if I needed to be concerned.
B00QE5AQLI|5|Great product. Very useful as it does all it says. Already used it to jump-start my car and as a back-up battery for my iPhone 6(went from 50% to full charge in just a few mins). Glad I bought it!
B0045WBVUM|5|Awesome product, was comfortable right out of the box, inflated of course.<br />Stopped the pain in my legs and my rear end immediately. I was going to buy an expensive gel seat.<br />Tried a gel pad first, it did not help at all, felt like a rock after just a few miles.
B000BPUTJG|5|Installs easy and a definite improvement in the fuel economy.
B00QELULBC|5|Love and and the whole world!!!!
B005N6XH6K|2|Fitted small
B0021YZER2|5|Tried everything to remove the calcium deposits from the glass shower door.  Nothing worked until I used Driven Extreme Glass Cleaner.  The glass looks like new again.
B00AFW0SE6|4|I was looking for something that matched the profile of my 2011 F150 Lariat. This did the trick. The product was well packaged and arrived promptly. The installation was pretty straight forward. They use and existing hole in the hood to hold the hood shield tight as well as some 3M sticky tape to keep the middle from bowing out. You also get a couple of conical bumpers to place near the ends of the shield so that the wind won't push it against the hood at higher speeds.<br /><br />Be careful when fitting the shield over the hood front. I accidentally scratched the hood on each side while I was fussing with the hardware. The edges of the shield are sharp. The scratches rubbed out with a little compound. If I had to do it again, I'd tape the edges with masking tape during the fitting and remove the tape after. Also, the 3M tape doesn't match the outline of the hood so only a portion of the tape ends up getting pressed against the hood. I gave it a couple of good tugs after installing it and it was rock solid though so I'm not concerned.<br /><br />Once installed, it looks like the factory installed it. I like the subtle upgrade. It's not &#34;in your face&#34; but it adds a nice touch to the truck.
B004GW21V4|5|Works great.  Fixes the issue that all Jeep owners eventually run into.  The cheap plastic caps break down and you will end up with the bottom half of the plastic cap stuck.  This solid piece design hadn't been an issue.  This should be stock on all wranglers
B0018C85VK|1|THESE ITEMS FIT MY VEHICLE BUT DID NOT WORK... THE OLD ONCE WORKED BETTER THAN THESE...
B0058IMW9Q|5|Correct part, price is right, fast delivery,
B004QMJB80|4|This harness/belt set is what you should expect for the price. We have a higher priced belt set and the webbing is thicker and instills more confidence that they'll keep you in your seat and the hardware is heavier and anodized. The hardware on these belts look like $60 hardware.<br />Overall we're certain that these will do the job, we just feel safer in the high end belts.
B005JVFTTM|5|Easy to read large numerals.
B00KSOKO2C|5|Easy to install and they look great. Much better than factory bulbs.
B00CJUW3HW|5|Awesome
B004E3A7FC|5|Worked perfectly (installed over a month ago) and has my air conditioning back to the way it was.
B00HFDC90E|5|Very bright. Great product
B00FGFVO2M|1|Could not get them to contour to the body of the car. Whether that is user error... I'm not sure. Would have preferred something that adheres to surface.
B000FCFFE4|5|Works really well. I have been stopped by other Veterans just to say hello and compare what years we served. I get my Jeep washed often and the frame stands up to the automatic wash with no problems. I would recommend this product to my other Veterans .
B00BFD8ATY|5|Got here 3days early. Took me ten minutes to install. No problem item works great. stickers sucks tho,lol. Great product!
B008I1HHTK|5|The heated vest works wonderfully to keep my core warm. I usually turn it up to high for 10 minutes or so there get plenty warm and wear it around low to medium to stay comfortable. The battery fits in a small pocket on the inside but I don't really notice it as I wear the vest.
B001PXZZC4|5|Wonderful seat! comfort increased 100%. We were able to do 4 hours non stop on the bike after installing this item
B000CGDCZ2|5|Great replacement part, exact to the OEM replaced part on my vehicle.

B001V8U12M|5|Good companion to the jacks to save time setting it up
B00496LM4E|1|Cheaply made product. Other ones  I've bought have much more rigid ends to make it easier to insert and remove the filter.
B0000AYJOI|5|great unit - installed it in a New Holland backhoe in which the hour meter was integral with the tach. Saved the customer about 300.00-customer was happy
B00BMV8WI8|5|is looks great in my midsize truck.
B002WIFJL8|5|Very well constructed, very pretty!  Great product
B000Q0LYNG|5|Fixed shifting problem on 2003 Sierra 4L60e tranny. For $11 I replaced both of them while I was in there.1/2 the price of auto parts store.
B000S2UG8G|5|Fixed a Check Engine light problem on my 1996 Saturn SL2 right out of the box.
B00BWJ888E|5|Great thanks
B00KMM6A6Y|5|They really work! !! I've to use a load resistor for each bulb to stop the hyper flashing as the description mentioned that might happen. Very simple to install the bulbs and the resistors.
B00SBZRR8O|5|I LOVE THE EASE AND SPEED THAT THIS PUMP PROVIDES WHEN FILLING MY TRUCK--BOAT OR LAWN TRACTOR.NO MORE SPILLED GAS. WOULD RECOMEND ANY DAY.
B0009IQZFM|4|Does a good job on drying car, and is not $20 like some other drying cloths.
B00MJ0RQII|5|Buy it
B005CLMPPK|5|Super  easy  to  install ,it fixed  my broken  handle  and I  am up and  running  again
B000FQ0W1G|5|Loved it
B00C0XCHKG|4|Looks good and works like stock. Hardware fit as expected
B000CB35AY|1|Part was faulty, and caused Lexus LS400 to run badly after only 2 hours.  I had to pull it out and get the OEM part instead.
B003F294PC|3|Fell apart
B00L1S0JU6|5|This towel is great!  This towel is very absorbent.  We have two Harley's and normally when we wash them we have to use multiple of the small microfiber towels too dry them.  This towel dried both easily with scratching or leaving streaks. We could have probably easily dried our jeep also.  Highly recommend this towel for anyone who is picky about there car care.
B003PIO7JY|2|Okay, not sure long term how well it will work. The mounting points are very flexy.
B00SLLA0PU|5|Manifold hoses were a direct fit, just as good as origional equipment. Came with &#34;o&#34; rings as well. Work very well.
B004RZU3Q0|5|They work great
B002OPHSHM|5|All perfect
B000C8PCNK|5|Been looking all over for this.  Glad I found one.  Thanks
B007JXRUOA|5|Another decal that was shipped promptly and was the perfect size for my rear window on a Miata PRHT.  Easy to apply and exactly as represented.
B008JYXYNY|5|This is a life saver!  I purchased a 2012 Miata and because it is a convertible, there is no height adjustment for the seat belt as you would find in a sedan.  It was more than uncomfortable, it was bordering on painful.  This gadget works like a charm.  Thank you LooPo!!!
B00OKMWOFS|1|Windshield wasn't tall enough.  I'm only 5'7&#34; and the wind was hitting from my neck up. A lot of vibration from wind. I returned the windshield.
B001PN88NC|5|surves purpose
B007OW6MD6|5|OEM quality.
B00BAZBTX6|2|It looks excellent with it's icy bluish white beam, but its NOT brighter than standard bulbs.<br />Quality is good for 6 bucks, but not worth more than that.<br /><br />EVERY ONE WHO LOOKS FOR REALLY BRIGHT BULBS SHOULD PAY MUCH MORE FOR &#34;SYLVANIA SILVERSTAR ULTRA&#34; OR &#34;SYLVANIA ZXE&#34;.
B00MGTS1WW|5|Hold a lot and everything stayed dry in down pour.
B001FAO8I4|4|affordable, as expected. Works, gauge works, does what i need. best option for occasional use.
B00INCBT5C|5|Better than OEM !!!
B003TPGKJ8|5|Came faster than expected. This is my favorite oil.
B009S94RK8|4|My daughter bought these.  The picture makes them look bronze in color but she actually received the chrome like she wanted.  We were worried due to the bronze picture posted and no other color (chrome, black, etc.) shown.
B0000AYZ3O|5|Perfect fit.  I purchased for my 97 Mariah Z198SE Shabah which had a 2 piece housing.  The one piece fit with no issues and was simple to install.  Highly recommended.
B00BFJD4C6|5|Excellent add on it got rid of some cavitation I was having. Huge increase in throttle response.
B004JB3EQ8|5|Good item
B00KTIBY4Y|5|Item was exactly as expected. Great value for price.
B0056A50PY|1|No what I expected,  smaller than stated
B00TI9OFFU|5|Great cover fits perfect
B0038B4BT4|2|The light collects moisture inside the lens and does not seal right on the cab of the truck allowing water to get inside your vehicle. They look nice and are bright just cheap quality.
B000816KNC|3|it was pink so i didnt like it but it is very clear and if you want a specific color theres more of a chance you might get the oppisite color
B00773I1HW|5|Previously had one like it.  Item carried deep sentimental value.  This new one is just like it.  I'm happy now.
B0093N7NTG|5|Took about an hour or so. Works perfect and easily understood directions.
B000VJSSKE|4|Great oil, run engine smooth, quiet.

B00DBEMHL2|1|Very bad color sender is the desired color<br />Desired color orange color Sender White
B00FBQKUVM|5|Nice buy
B00E9HWSV4|5|This is a very good floor mat, and the price excellent
B000CMF5ME|5|These worked fine and mine were all brass.
B0015PKC5W|5|worked great
B00F58N6N0|5|Wow i love this rugged matts.  So worth buying!!!!
B000A6Z9LO|5|This light came as described and very well packaged with a excellent price .
B00IN40Y3S|2|i wouldn't recommend it i bought a set of these stickers for my laptop and they come off when i don't even touch them i have to stickers on the back side of my laptop next to the apple logo and one side says onste  because  the M and R came off and next to the track pad it says  Onter  so don't buy these for your laptop and if they don't stick to the laptop, what do you think these will do on a car in the rain?
B00RV2X4JE|5|looks good sticks well
B008ZYZOZO|5|Love that they came squished in vacuum
B009ZIMXLW|5|Made my truck really look like a platinum with just this simple touch.
B001AZUAQS|5|It is a well made key holder. Love it.
B00T3TQLKW|1|I bought two of these fans to keep my 1.8 liter Acura Integra cool.  They DO NOT move enough air to keep the engine cool.  The OEM fans moved WAY more airflow across the radiator than these cheap pieces of garbage.  I ended up putting my OEM fans back on the car and its cooling normally now, after buying a new motor for one of them.  I did verify the wiring was correct for as a &#34;puller&#34; since they are mounted on the back of the radiator.
B00MJ41EDC|1|Fitting is not good
B009PJJI8M|5|Not bad. Can't beat the price
B00RXXLJGG|5|its amazing,great for the lower back...its a must have item
B00ELNATDA|1|The magnetic backing is poor quality. Every time you open the diswasher door the decal falls off.
B00EVGMKCU|2|i thought the little lines was a measurements 2 it but were the actual product<br /><br />that might be my fault
B00UQ0X2XQ|5|Very bright! easily installed by the teenage boy and he loves it!
B00H6XPZN6|5|Works as advertised.  Great that they give you extra suction cups since we lost one the first day of use.
B00AZ4U15A|4|It fits no complaints
B00BSKTUXO|5|Works great. Saved me a couple hundred bucks.
B005VUQX32|5|It fit perfectly.  I had to remove some interior trim to get the old weather strip out and make it much easier to get the new part in. There is one piece of interior plastic trim just left of the dash that has clip that goes through the dash.  You need to loosen the parking brake bolts to get it out without breaking the part.  The GM service manual is no help on getting this part out.
B00UMR23OW|5|They work as expected,bright light,definatly better than oem bulbs..
B0015DMNIS|5|Love it wish I had gotten it a long time ago, already done 9 bearings with it in a month. Only problem is the bracket didn't fit well on 2 trucks both gm, but got it to work
B0045G09TC|4|Ordered a wallet chain and got a keyring chain...Still works but a huge loop at the end
B00QLW8NQY|4|While the covers for my configuration of screws to hold the frame in place required that I glue the chrome like 'heads' in place, I still think this frame classes up my beautiful Fiat w/o advertising a dealership unnecessarily.
B007GENYEW|5|Beautiful design!
B00VN3JWQG|1|the chain i got with this kit was not the right link size. it says it is a 520/98 chain mine was for some weird reason a 520/96 chain how that happen is beyond me have to order new chain now just to get my quad back on the trails. Thanks for the delay on my riding.
B004WMF854|1|Thought this was a great product but develop a flicking from the LED's. Spyder Tech. Support was not very helpful in resolving this issue with the LED's. All they suggested was to remove the front bumper and return the headlights to Amazon. Plus at one point they stopped answering my emails.<br />I was able to resolve the issue by purchasing  Dynamics Diode CANBUS Anti-Flicker Module and install the module in line with the 12 VDC to eliminate the flickering LED's. This added an additional $30 to the purchase but well worth it because I did not have to remove the front bumper. Plus I cannot say enough about the support given to me by the people a Dynamics Diode.
B00LEVN7GS|3|The strobes look good but once you turn your headlights on you can't hardly see them. And the wires are only 3 feet long so I had to splice them longer to run all the lights to all 4 corners of my truck.
B00II8HCZC|4|Quality product, just as pictured
B003Z9T33I|5|put this on and drove on a 5000 mile trip. works great
B00QXDF3LE|5|Perfect size I was looking for. Solid design, easy to apply.
B0026FCGEU|5|Exactly what I was needing.  Fast delivery.  Thank you very much.
B009X1UZ2A|5|Perfect
B002JFEETW|5|Great glasses!
B000CQOIR8|5|The hitch was a close fit . The outer bumper braces had to be removed and would not fit in the position that the instructions said it would . i also had to drill out two holes on the cross tube in order to bolt it in place . Not the most fun thing i have ever done but still wasn't to bad to mount on a Ford Ranger . Way more hitch than my dad needs to pull his boat . Well built but i wouldn't put it on a truck pulling a large trailer .
B00E7VFILY|3|Item arrived 5 days later than what I was told. The cup holder is the worst out of the three items I bought (door handles and place in front of the shift knob) for my 2014 dart. This product is a very loose fit in my stock cup holder, unlike what was advertised. Overall it's a decent product, just wish it was sized better.
B00XCKKEMY|5|Cool sticker. Well made and detailed
B00ZYTRQUY|3|This seems to be a nicely made can, but we are returning it because it is too wide to fit in our holder.  The description says the can is 14&#34; wide, and the main part of the can is, but it has a ridge on either side making it more like 14 1/2&#34; to 15&#34;.  If you do not need the can to fit in a holder, this should be perfect, but if you are needing it to fit in a standard can mount, it will not.
B003V3PZOY|5|Good for your car.
B00S11FZ32|5|arrived quickly and easy to install.
B005CLP92G|5|Good
B00E16LUSK|5|works great
B008HZOZ2E|5|Great
B004ZGWAOY|5|Item was exactly as listed
B00BS102A8|5|Cute and inexpensive.
B009X3TKPQ|5|Good smell
B00CHH5X92|3|McGard SplineDrive lugs listed compatibility with my model year Dodge Ram.  The McGard lugs are too narrow to hold on the center cover of my factory wheels, therefore I couldn't use the entire set of locking lugs and keep the center cover in place.  This was disappointing since the kits is for an entire lug replacement.
B005MZYY5A|4|ok
B00G2T6O30|4|Pros:<br />- Looks so much better than ezpass<br />- Suction cups stay put<br />- EzPass fits perfectly, no rattling<br /><br />Cons<br />- Initially was almost impossible to open, now after 2 months it randomly pops open while mounted. Not a huge deal but kinda annoying.
B001123W7Y|5|Went on my 06 Polaris Sportsman 800. Love it!! If you are looking for a good cargo container that secures to you 4 wheeler with very little hassle then this is it!. As always, shipped quickly! Great seller and item!
B00AIWLQRG|5|My daughter loves it on her truck!  Snaps into place and looks great.
B001HJR9XE|5|Simple easy to install anyone could do it
B00IXF7I9A|2|Back fenders fell off after a week of use. But I also live on a gravel road. Front ones are still in contact though!
B00K889FCI|1|Doesn't work as good as the reviews say it does, We didn't see any change in the headlights. This was tried on 2 different cars
B00LJDF5UW|5|Yay
B00062ZGO2|5|Easy install and improved the fuel economy
B001O7PNNM|5|this compound is amazing brought the shine back to a 14 year old car and removed minor scratches  works great with the DA power system  not sure how well it would work with just hand application
B00DJ4FGIK|5|I drained my 2012 Subaru Outback CVT fluid, refilled with this Valvoline Synthetic CVT fluid.<br />*Warning this can be dangerous, and I take no responsibility for any problems, accidents, failures etc.*<br />I drain a little less than 6 quarts, and filled only 5 quarts into the vehicle, and it started to spill back out. I had to plug the fill hole, start the vehicle and let the CVT fluid warm up, then with the electronic brake on, my foot on the brake, engine still running, I shifted into reverse, neutral, drive, a few times, finally back into park, to get the CVT fluid into the system. With the engine still running, I removed the fill plug and pumped the last of the fluid in. Subaru Outback org forum has better details and thats where I learned to buy this fluid, my local dealership won't sell it to regular customers. But I recommend you buy the gaskets for the drain plug and fill plug from the dealership. Also this disposable pump http://www.amazon.com/Bhbuy-Portable-Manual-Siphon-Transfer/dp/B00MIDZYWG/ref=sr_1_36?s=automotive&ie=UTF8&qid=1439232877&sr=1-36&keywords=fluid+pump was critical to pumping fluid into the CVT fill hole, as there is no room to angle the bottle into the fill hole. After doing this, I felt the transmission was slightly smoother, especially when I let it coast and the transmission doesn't down shift so harshly (weird, why would a CVT downshift? I don't know, but I could feel it.) [[ASIN:B00MIDZYWG Bhbuy Portable Manual Car Siphon Hose Gas Oil Water Liquid Transfer Hand Pump Sucker]]

B0007XTGCI|5|Great jack stands much more safer to use.  will be buying more of these in the future.
B00SM8R04Q|5|Worked right away with Torque Pro, so much easier than using my old obd usb hooked up to my notebook.  Was able to use the &#34;fast&#34; settings with Tourque Pro, which they say won't work on less compatible devices, so I was happy.
B008Y3PWLW|4|Work very well
B003PB9PN4|5|Worked great in my stump grinder. A lot less expensive than buying at the store.
B00SISKQW8|4|Long time to ship product is great make sure u peel off the sticker behind the logo and put it to the metal backing
B00IDIAXT4|1|This rear graphic is not discribed properly.  It is not Deep Dark Black like the picture.  When installed it has a slight black tint.  Please see the enclosed picture.

B00RM64QVY|1|I have a 2006 cbr 600rr this did not work with my twobro. No instructions came with it I had to fabricate more brackets the wiring is so cheap so I had too buy more lights and wire. Not worth it!
B001C90XD2|5|Excellent, see my EBC yellow pads review.

B008Y5C4AW|4|Look great
B000EDUTX6|5|Got of stove top cover quickly.  Looks a millions times better than our metal cover that came with the Atwood stove.
B000WJFF6S|5|I use these to change the front and rear tires on my ex500. The curved end on the large iron is especially useful for getting that last bit of bead over the rim, when mounting tires, although it still requires moderate effort. Having the three different sizes is useful, and the biggest iron strikes a good balance of leverage, and not being too beefy to fit into tight spaces.<br /><br />My rims are pretty scratched up after using these a few times, but I don't use rim protectors, so I'm not surprised.
B004TRKBOK|5|Hopefully I will never use it, but feel like it's a nice tool to have. Maybe if I am around a kid or pet locked in a car, I'll have the means<br />to save a life. Got it as a 2-pack and at an &#34;add-on&#34; price so I feel like it was worth it.
B00NEL6HK4|5|Great buy
B00D2HTIIS|2|Can tap leaks badly, the gauges work but I wonder about quality with such a poor can tap.
B000P70VMU|5|Works
B000N37E94|5|Worked very well, much better than the plastic alternatives!
B004QEM7HK|5|well made easy to use. cranks my boat up real easy
B0007RDVD4|4|Didn't expect it to be so big, its just too big for the task at hand
B003PERH9K|5|Great stickers, have been on my car for years and still look like the day I applied them.
B004ICWBFI|5|The quality of the graphic is top-notch.  I have purchased multiple emblems for my personal vehicles and for friends.  The quality has been consistent.  The free standard shipping is FAST and the seller ships quite quickly.
B000CC3EP4|1|With only one  support on hitch part, makes a very loose fit and no way to tighten it down.  Unless your hitch pin hole is the exact length of this hitch step support leg, you will not be happy with it.  The other design of a hitch step the has two legs that goes into the hitch you can lock it down with a locking hitch pin with anti-rattle feature.
B0000AYC87|1|WORTHLESS!  I was expecting a cap with a zerk fitting but instead got a cap with a rubber cover.  More useless than the caps I am replacing.  In addition--they cannot be returned!  What's up with that?
B00QVLQHAO|5|Received my Terapump today.  Put in a couple of rechargeable batteries and ran out to test it out on my riding mower.  It has had water in the gas tank for a long time now and I have dreaded having to take apart the gas hose to drain it.  I put an empty gas can on the top of the mower deck and clipped the drain hose to it, inserted the pump into the gas tank and switched on the pump.  Started pumping immediately and had it drained in about a minute.  I loved it!!!  Recommend it highly.
B007P9YXEI|5|AWESOME LOVE THEM QUICK DELIVERY
B005RYI7C2|1|this is just water, dont buy it
B00NHBYOA6|4|Better than I expected.  But no thermostat.
B0006IX7Y2|5|Great addition to my swer hose kit
B00OCEGONC|3|It would be better if it had fluid levels labeled on the side. Used this to change a vw tdi and it took an hr to 3.5 qts out.
B00JIJ4LWW|1|Didn't work for me and smells bad
B007DKPFNM|5|Timely and as advertised.
B004MEGXLU|2|Great quality t-bolt clamps, but the sizing is completely misleading. 2.75&#34; t-bolt clamp does not fit a 2.75&#34; coupler like you would think and is just barely too small. Other reviews indicate I'm not the only one to make this mistake. Please correct the listing to reflect how 99% of the rest of the car world understands what a 2.75&#34; t-bolt clamp is.
B0074EJ9EI|4|Going by steering wheel measurement, 1st ordered same item in small but it was clearly never going to fit, despite a few diff. warm up tricks. Ret'd that one and ordered a Med. (yes, size matters-sometimes).<br />Was able to install it in abt. 5 mins. by carefully using 2 slim flathead screwdrivers to pry one edge over the bottom of the wheel. No clue about product durability, but the wheel is no lo ger searing hot when I get in the car in Aug. in Tallahassee! Of note, I have mod.-severe arthritis in my hands and this cover is vastly more comfortable than the bare wheel, given the added diameter of the padded grip. Should we have any unexpected snafus over time, I'll let you know, but I do recommend this product.
B008CE0LIC|3|had one part bent, need to fix it and not that easy to put together
B0073MGJI0|5|Perfect replacement. Even had new clips for oil and transmission coolers.
B00WY5L09O|1|100% Totally Rip Off. Do not believe these Reviews. This was a $40 Rip off that I purchased at a Auto Part store. I promise this kit does not do what it says it does. It actually made them worse.
B000WJFF6S|5|Works
B004NEM6EC|5|Fit was perfect ,change took only a little while,work fine.
B00F6BAKHQ|1|Did not fit 2004 Jeep Liberty.  Dealership said it would.
B00AZ4TE8K|3|They're  a perfect  fit . I have  wanted  these for  years. They  do  the  job  they  are  intended  to  do and went  on easy. The  price  was way  less  than  an  auto parts  store. The only  thing  is  that  the  double  sided tape let loose  and  if I  had  not  noticed  it , I  know  that  the  wind would  take  it off,so I  have to  add better double  sided  tape  .
B00V337VNM|5|It looks good in my car. I will buy again.
B000EDUUIA|4|It works good if the wive could hit the same spot.  I will have to buy one more so she can hit the same spot.  Maybe a ball in the windshield....and then maybe add  flashing strobe lights, and then maybe add laser siren so she could hear when to stop.<br /><br />But the item works amazing if I get to drive the car.
B00IGZQGAY|5|Working great

B007UHPSCG|5|They work as expected

B00U7F7NDA|5|very goo
B000B68V6I|5|I generally like to keep 20 gallons of gasoline safely stored in my garage for emergencies and household use. This product has an effective automatic measuring design that doesn't spill and allows you to get the proper mixture into your fuel container without any guesswork. I've stored gasoline with this product for up to a year without any significant breakdown of the gas and with the ability to run it in my autos and lawn equipment.
B00C47ZBHE|5|Perfect fit.  Looks great
B00510GHE2|4|Hoping it was more permanent. Have to put on and take off so they won't get stolen. Fit perfectly. I do like them.
B004MC0BZG|1|It leaked air like a sieve. I ended up having to walk my bike down the sidewalks to the nearest gas station that had a compressor.
B000JFJMJ6|5|First review i have written...  i love this tool! you use the spot weld cutter first and this thing slices right on through. Truly worth every penny! I have beat the heck out of it and the blade doesn't have a dent yet. BUY ONE!!!
B00NLISSFM|5|Great, comfortable fit... looks great showing off my favorite brand!
B003FAF2W8|5|Fit perfect.  No problems.

B00G9ARJMC|5|Had no problems installing the rubber inserts. Works well. Good value for the price.
B00M5DR4AO|1|Before I ordered I checked to see if they would fit. A 2009 nissian rouge and it said yes ..but they don't ..so I waited for almost 3 weeks for nothing and I lost money and still missing a center cap
B00LATB2IE|3|I made a mistake I was supposed to get a white T20 which I did for my vehicle !!!!!!!!!!!

B000WJ95D2|5|Fits great,no problems.
B0055XHAVO|5|Love this mattress. It is super comfortable and very reasonably priced.
B00IQFDBTS|5|Item as described.  Fast shipping Thank you
B0089VA4ZS|5|This is a great value for such a hard to find object. Most auto parts do not carry this product, so it has to be ordered which cost more!  It comes with a rubber seal on outer edge this helps make a snug fit!  I will buy in bulk on next order.
B00AEH4S7A|5|I had to return this item because I totaled my BMW before it arrived. I have ordered this item before as my BMW logo would disappear periodically and it is a good product.
B00DRBGNH8|5|Sounds just right.
B00CC00ITE|5|Great for ryobi chainsaw

B00FQ0ROZS|5|They are bright...
B001O5LICO|2|super cheap construction have had it for a couple of years now, not worth it

B0076D5OI2|1|only worked one day
B009XOTRBM|5|Easy to install and kept my three bike rake in place on my travel travel.
B00DJBQ1SW|5|I recently purchase a 3/4 ton pickup.  But now the old ramps are too short.  I found these Titan 7.5 foot folding ramps and they looked like jus the ticket for my ATV. I knew I didn't want ramps with the bars because I occasionally have to load my lawn mower or BBQ.  The plate tops make it a breeze.  And you can walk up and down them, too, because they have traction!  They are very lightweight and easy to use.  I gotta say that I love 'em.
B00KN0UOEE|5|I've used 303 on my boat for years and the seats look just fantastic as well as the rest of the vinyl surfaces. I recently purchased a new truck with a powdered coated metal folding tonneau cover with a lot of exposed vinyl gaskets. There was a bit of confusion about whether it was wise to put in on there but the good people who make the stuff assured me it was safe but I needed to dry it completely so it wouldn't streak. Well, the first coating, I did have a bit of trouble but I figured that was well worth it to protect the cover from fading. Jump forward to the fourth application and now it is amazing easy to keep from streaking. I simply mist it, then rub it in and the top looks fantastic and I know it's being protected against UV rays. Yeah, some complain that you have to reapply it every couple or three weeks (depending on the rain) but it's so easy to do that that's no problem with me.
B007Q4MOGG|4|Took awhile to get but otherwise was good.
B004BT6N2K|1|horrible, horrible horrible!!!. bought this for my 2012 Nissan quest. amazon site says it does not fit bit piaa site it will fit. I also measured to make sure I have the same length and it is the same. the thing is installation is horrible!!!. design is horrible!!! I remove the old wiper blades with ease. when installing the new pia wipers, I noticed there was no clamp to hold the j arm of the wiper. I still tried to fit the blades on the arm with no avail. I was sweating inside my garage installing the wipers. I did get to fit it in but it came loose immediately because there was no clamp to hold it in place. waste of money. going to return.
B00G0PJ03W|5|Works great nice and bright  cable is better then most lights on here would buy another
B0030E9YWS|2|Description did not mention that larger numbers on the speedometer where in Km.
B00EC0Z05O|5|EXCELENT
B001XCBCQK|4|Works ok doesn't seem to tighten real right against the roof,and not sure of the quality yet but it keeps the dog in the back so I'm liking it.
B0024NSVLQ|5|Fit perfectly with my 2000 Honda CR-V. Great price too!!!
B007JSGR9Y|5|Good just what I wanted
B0013Y0VRE|4|Installed this windshield on a 2014 VN900C and it was just a tad short for my short 5'7&#34; self. I have to slouch a bit so that the wind doesnt hit me straight in the face. However, it does the intended job for the rest of me and keeps the wind and bugs from my body. It looks great and is pretty solid on the bike. At the end of the day, it comes down to looks vs practicality so it is an individual choice. Ride safe.
B0055DMZYQ|5|Nice looking box. I was impressed with the design and custom looking fit
B004U7N7YA|5|Perfect
B006BDWM4C|5|Ordered two.  both worked well.  I had them cut at home depot for no charge and they were easy to 'program' to the car.
B00N7KNIX6|5|cute
B005IUT7S8|1|I bought the kit and the cam sprocket was already chipped. Luckily I found one that fit in my garage but I can say I will be using a different brand only because that shows the parts could've been tossed around and not truly cared for.
B00563JQ9C|5|A+++++
B00Q8SJDJC|4|Very durable
B00EHKQIPA|4|Good replacement cover that fits just fine on my rangers 8.8 differential.<br />It came with a small round magnet glued on the inside; which i removed. first of all it wasn't glued in very good and the magnet wasn't very<br />strong. I didn't want to take any chances of it coming off and getting chewed up in the gears.
B00MOSXKFS|2|Lasted about 2 weeks and one of the emblems came off.
B00XR48BPC|3|i had to return this ... not for the BMW R1150GS As describe
B00EA0ZB7I|5|These replaced a set of Hella off road lights that were damage by a driver backing up into the jeep. I love the look of the lights with the low profile. The lights seem brighter that the Hella lights and look so much better.
B009J142M8|1|Part was &#34;catalogued&#34; incorrectly, so it did not fit application; even though it was stated it would fit in fitment area. I paid $60.00 extra for a 4 day &#34;rush&#34; shipping. BTW: this typically would be an over night shiiping. Had to send it back, lost weekend, vacation in Tahoe, and $60.00 to boot.
B0012DRW2I|5|Fits perfectly. It rolls up instead of accordion style folding.
B00CJUW3HW|5|We got this for our son who will be 10 in 2016...  It's for his first car!
B0028JQYPG|5|So far, no cars have fallen and crushed anyone, so, they have that going for them
B00T36ODKK|5|I install this unit 3 weeks ago its the BEST.
B004TOB6EW|5|This got good quality and really heavy duty and works great for hauling the sewage
B001O2ZT90|4|The gauge is too small. Could also do with finer steps in the gauge monitor.
B00LBIX48K|5|These worked great...and customer care was helpful and great...
B00GQ2TC14|5|Works good
B0029V9DRY|1|I used this for one trip. When I returned home the top had small holes, making it not water proof. However, Amazon was great in allowing me to return the item. I would recommend buying a hard case.
B00IIVUXLO|5|Just what I needed
B00IK2MNZK|5|Product worked perfectly on my Scott's edger. I didn't even have to adjust the carburetor. Engine started on the first pull. Thanks !
B00YDE2SKO|5|Great product for the price.  Used it immediately for my small child in the back seat.
B008A891KY|5|Girlfriend loves it, just what she needed too keep the heat down fits her Chevy Equinox windshield very well be sure too buy the jumbo or XL..
B00V33KPU8|5|works like it should.
B0006309MK|5|Love them. Easy installation and great quality. Put them on my 2001 Jeep Wrangler.
B00GWEWV5A|2|did not fit
B00B2AENZK|5|Direct fit for the factory replacement
B000JZYW14|5|ALMOST an exact fit. The pipe fit the exhaust manifolds perfectly and all the threaded bungs for the 02 sensors were in exactly the right spot. Minor adjustment on a stabilizer arm and I was back in business. Walker is a trusted name in exhaust system and have used them for years. This one was no exception. Would recommend for any do it yourself person.
B00029K01I|5|These were perfect.
B000C8Z8LG|5|Exact replacement for the one on the Ford Windstar I was working on. Good welds, quality material, and excellent fit. Another great Walker product.
B000EDOT8C|5|Terrific
B0073J97K0|5|Worked perfect on my 1983 V45 magna.
B000C57YMK|5|fixed the problem thanks
B00GTGU554|5|Really made a difference on the lighting in my truck
B009B5ROYU|5|Ordered these for a 2011 F150 Lariat with the 3.5L Ecoboost. At 70,000 miles I was getting some skipping when I floored it. Pulled the old plugs (pretty easy compared to my old 5.4 Triton) and put these in. They came gapped perfectly for my vehicle. Problem solved. They were delivered in a factory 4-pack along with 2 loose plugs. The loose plugs had the tips covered with a plastic shield so even though they were loose in the box, they arrived with no problems. Real quick shipping. The whole job took less than an hour and I was off and running.
B001M6VAHS|5|Just right!  Fit & function made the application easy and fast , price was reasonable also. My 1998 Dodge Dakota is ready for its next 75,000 miles.<br />very pleased.
B00JVHLS3G|1|bad item faded fast.... turned brown in color
B003Z9T33I|5|Perfect fit for my truck.  Took less than 5 mins for my husband to put on my truck.  Very easy to use as well.
B000BQYH6Q|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B0027ERH8U|5|What do you need to say.  Fit perfect.
B0041TNLYS|4|This fan appears to work great.  We had to return the first one that didn't work at all.  Vendor sent a replacement right away and we sent the defective one back.<br /><br />Docked them 1 star because of the defective one we received - due to the extra cost, time and trouble for us to remove and install twice.
B00826OVWW|5|Love it, nice to get two in one regular creeper and then a seat makes it far more useful,  wish they had a heaver duty covering, I can see it will tear easily so I'd better be careful good value, used it the first day
B004TO4036|5|Worked great on my '12 KLX250s when switching my gearing to 13/45
B00X04JRMU|5|This product is outstanding! I have used Aero Cosmetics products on aircraft for many years. This kit is the way to get started. Great directions on how to use the product.
B001DRJO56|5|I wanted to get something that offered more flow for my '11 F150 Lariat w/ Ecoboost. I didn't want to go with a cold air intake or a K&N because of the turbos. Heard about the Wix and decided to give it a try. Arrived overnight...wow! The filter material is significantly greater in the Wix than the Motorcraft that I had in the truck. Looks like it will offer better filtration and other reviews showed this to be a good filter. Fit was perfect.
B00CWHZ9Y6|5|Adds a clean look to the interior very happy with my purchase
B00RVDUVK8|5|Great Decals! They are good quality and look great on my vehicle. Thanks.
B001OMPJGS|4|Not sure that they're brighter, but definitely look better.
B001DDI3E8|3|doesn't stick out enough like a regular mirror and it moves.
B000I2079E|5|Like many, I grew up thinking WD-40 was the last word in loosening stubborn fasteners. I still keep a ubiquitous blue-and-yellow can around, to be sure, but when my to-do list for the day includes a nut that hasn’t budged in a while, PB Blaster is the first thing I reach for. Spray on, get a cup of coffee – the fastener will be loose enough for even the shortest of stubby ratchets to remove. It’s also a lot easier on your hands than WD-40.<br /><br />I couldn’t imagine my toolbox without it.
B00JA393Y2|5|Worked great on my MINI.
B007AORLC4|5|Nice way to adjust antenna direction for best reception. I use an iPhone app &#34;TV Towers&#34; to find local stations first so I know the real channel number.  Easy to install.  Better reception of distant stations.
B007ACZTGQ|5|This kit contains very high quality and rugged components. Definitely a cut above the local discount store's locking kit. I like that they are keyed the same AND that each of the three components gives its own set of two keys, making six total. Installing this kit has increased my confidence that my trailer may be stolen only by someone that is very, very intent on having it... and that is what insurance is for.
B00KGGTF9U|5|The product was delivered in time and is really good. I have tried many other sunshades for my car but they would never fit. Not only does this one fit my car it also helps keep the temp inside not from rising to high levels. All in all I am happy with this product.
B001BNASPM|4|great product.
B00HRXUNKA|5|I installed on my 2003 Saab 9-5. Went on easily and fit perfect.
B004UR2DRC|5|works great with the modifications my husband made. very sturdy
B004C443PS|4|I liked these a lot. They are great quality. The Velcro is very strong. Even with bending or moving of the wrist or hands in any direction, I was never worried they would start to come loose. I needed them for a costume for a show but I don't like costumes that look cheap so I buy all of the pieces separate and get the real thing. I was a jewel thief but I needed to still have my fingers free to hold on to the jewel and dance with my partner also. These looked great. My only down side was that they didn't really allow much bending of the fingers. It would be much harder to make a fist or clench your hands in these but they do have a great grip. I didn't drop anything so that's good! The knuckle holes didn't match up but I'm also a woman so I'm not sure how much that may have to do with it or with not being able to bend my fingers very well. Over all these are great. They do the job.
B000BUU5WW|5|Works great. Just got it and have only used it once, but seems to be good quality.
B00AMALSQ8|1|This thing I received is different than one on picture, it came already with scratches and dents, it does not have brake light switch and lever looks like it came for some other break cylinder. Reservoir cap screws are made of butter, they cant stripped same moment as tried to unscrew them.
B005I4DNP2|5|I've purchased two of these, one for the truck and one the motorcycle. They work great for wiring a more powerful horn.
B00D7T4LX8|4|This are good, but there not metal like they use to be.
B00RGZWIW0|5|Perfect size and compartments make it easy to organize stuff.  Keep road emergency tools, such as compressor, OBD, tire repair kit, battery jump pack, basic tools, umbrella, etc.
B009EQ85VM|5|love it!
B001BCLWFS|5|loved the low cost
B00DCG51Y4|5|Perfect fit.
B0072UGXSY|5|So easy to use and install i wouldn't buy any other brand and is easily tuned to any trailer for perfect braking!
B005DLQ9ME|5|Super great !!!!!
B002XL304W|4|A bit on the large side. This was to go on a 14&#34; camper/rv tire. I measured my tire twice before I bought it, then again after I received this and it was noticeable a bit oversized. When I need a new one again, I'll get the smaller size next time. I made this one work.
B001F799X6|5|This is an OEM product so it's a perfect fit. Works great. Much cheaper than buying from the dealer. Totally recommend to anyone.
B009PJJG1Q|5|Great product!
B0012BL8LG|5|Worked fine so far. But i have only used it once so far.
B0033WDDZ6|5|The installation was easy and it is a perfect fit. Took about 5 minutes.
B00USRF8M0|5|Very good.
B00ML7IELC|1|Didn't work. Returned for refund. 4 months now still no refund.
B000CB3X4W|3|It's a rubber strip. Installed and probably won't know of it's performance until Fall.
B004IVGA0G|3|would be better if it could hold a smaller pole
B0053HNVJW|5|Great product works well
B000HBM37A|4|Works fine!
B001TJ70ZE|5|Must have for a Jeep JK!
B00D39LZ36|5|SUPER
B00CIETVC4|5|They look great and no complaints.
B0031GV90K|5|Was as described, and works great. Price was low.
B00130N1H0|3|Worked GREAT initially, but key is getting difficult to use after just a short time. Will likely have to buy another one before too long.
B00VR8K4SM|2|The product itself get's five stars. The reason for the posted two stars is: the USPS shipping label applied to my order by LT Luxury was so unreadable, it required &#34;hands-on&#34; work at USPS to discern my address. A half shade lighter and this order would be sitting in a dead letter box somewhere within the USPS. #shippingfail
B00SR2DAF0|2|Wouldn't work on my bike
B001S8F7Q0|4|Sounds good on my 4.0 wrangler. Has loud deep sound at idle-1600 rpm then quiets down.
B00CUX5T2Y|5|Fit perfectly with no problems.
B0052PXO38|5|Easy to use. Works well.
B00KXKW6WC|5|nice item, easy to assemble, wish it had dust caps
B00DHJEV4W|5|Super
B00UGNBJOW|1|The vinyl part is not clear doesn't look right in car
B008G3IWTO|1|They are made of cheap plastic and broke within a month of use.
B00CBTRMZ4|5|Installation was quick and easy. I use this on my 26' SeaRay to keep both my starting and deep cycle batteries charged. Works excellent in that capacity. I did have to extend one set of leads to reach around to one battery but did so with some 12 gauge wire and solder less connectors followed by a generous taping with electrical tape and it works fine. One note....this charger does NOT like extension cords. Not even short, air conditioning type cords. If you try to use an extension cord, the unit will turn off almost immediately, so make sure you can mount it where you can plug it directly into an A/C outlet.
B003CGEQ5E|5|What can I say. Its a piece of metal that bolts to the frame. All the holes matched up perfectly.
B000E2CSVS|4|Good article.
B00K1C1WC2|5|great chocks
B001AM5Q10|4|Best shocks I ever bought.
B00GTEQXYS|5|I like these switches. They are great for the price and I have used many in box mods without a single failure. My customers like they way they feel. Use a light touch when soldering.
B00008RW9U|4|i gave it as a gift for my brother moving to California,  i'm sure it will come in handy with all the drought out there. very well made.
B001A0SGBY|5|Modified this to use as a side mirror when I took the doors off my Jeep.  Well made product.
B008KZKDYA|5|Great product
B000VKRQDI|5|I wanted to review this product after 1 year. The filter is an exact fit, takes a little time and maybe an upholstery tool (TEKTON 5873 Door Panel Remover).<br />Remove the weatherstripping closest to the windshield. Lift the plastic cover on the passenger side, and the housing that holds the element is under there. To my surprise, it was dirtier than expected for one year of mostly city street driving.<br />It works great, doing it's job to trap particles. The operation only takes around 10 minutes, start to finish.
B00QGJGP5I|3|bags swing back and forth.  Other then that, they do what their suppose to do.
B000C7TV5G|1|Doesnt come close to fitting. This radiator only fits a very small percentage of A body dodges and plymouths. Out of 8 darts and dusters I looked at that this radiator is supposed to be correct for, it fit NONE of them. Why they dont make one that fits the bulk of the A body cars is beyond me. Tech support told me that they didnt make one that fit a 2bbl 318 car and didnt seem to care beyond that. Spend another $50 on something else and it will drop right in, look better and you can still use your shroud.
B00PJPHEBO|5|This is my second review as the first adapter was faulty and was promptly replaced with a working product.<br /> I didn't bother to return the product as I thought that you get what you pay for and was not about to go through a return on a 12 buck diagnosis tool. I just left a 1 star and my issue. I was contacted a day later and the company had a replacement in my hand by the weeks end. The replacement works great and since it doesn't drop BT connection, I also broke down and purchased the full Torque Pro obd2 app and it does open other features that are great. I wish I had this back 20 years ago when I was a auto tech. I guarantee that 90% of anyone who owns a high end scanner will shelf if for the little elm 327 tool, period. I have fixed a friend's car who had just ordered a MAF sensor for over 150 bucks because the parts guy &#34;read the codes&#34; turned out if you have a vacuum leak between the MAF and the intake it will spit several codes, I looked down and saw an open hose that let it give false results. Plugged the leak and it runs like a champ.
B000CKJL94|4|Solid brake parts.
B00CLBTHJ6|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B00A2XD8SQ|1|Too small for my wheel
B000NCOKQK|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B00ZPMVKD4|5|This bulb was the perfect replacement that I needed- exactly as described. I found the light it casts to be very cool and not harsh at all, giving stark, sharp illumination without glare. I love tat these bulbs have a 56k hour lifespan, which realistically means I will never have to bother changing these lights again. At this price, that's pretty amazing and also good for the environment, since I'll be producing less waste. My only advice is to make sure you're getting the proper model number that you need for compatibility.<br /><br />I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.
B00TXVNX60|4|The cover fit my 2011CTSV fob well; however, I changed out the screw in part connecting the covered fob to a key ring. In my opinion, it was not a secure connecting device so I used a split ring to attach the key ring through the cover and fob. Shipping is old school slow but with my  modification and the  low price, four stars
B00T0U02AO|5|Perfect!
B003GCA3XI|5|Good product. The reservoir is made out of a cast metal instead of the factory plastic and looks much more reliable. The original pump bolted right in with the supplied screws and everything worked the first try. This motor may have more draw than the factory trim motor as it kept tripping the breaker in the outboard motor.
B005NLQAHS|5|This thing is amazing. Works perfect with Torque on my Note 4.<br />I'm telling everyone I know about this thing.
B00BP4DFWK|5|Very rich and clean glow. I have 2 installed as my reverse bulbs. Even though they're green I have no problems seeing while I back up. People comment about how good they look all time.
B001MXTOKQ|4|a bit on the large side, thought it was smaller in size
B002W2V19I|4|it's good to have use for my ID and I have a 05 BMW 745 LI thanks.
B00EYVR0OA|5|Good product
B007LQPCZO|5|Fit my 2015 F350 great and really protect the floors.  Glad I chose this brand and model.
B005VO2GRA|5|The price was right and the part was right.
B000BYCS78|5|awesome service, quick shipping, and description of product was right on.....installation onto my truck was quick and easy good stuff..
B00BUJ29CM|5|Worked perfectly
B0040IE734|5|Product is as advertised. Coating seems durable and has a nice flat almost satin finish.
B00B1G9788|1|Poor quality and darker than it appears on sight. Bulky. Hard to put on. Not worth the price, at all.
B002ZRQ4A6|5|Fits perfectly
B00F0QAOOG|1|Wear house deal and they were broken when I got them the wear house did not inspect them well before shipping or put them back for sale!
B00X4S6C1Q|1|I  get the mats, and they were cheap, and that is a kind word for them. An ironed on picture ( not stitched) on mats that wasn't even done well. You could see press marks around the edges, and some edges of the picture are already lifting.  I didn't even bother trying to send them back, what a waste of time and money this company has been. At least I get to grind my feet into the cheap mats when I think about how long (Two weeks !!) I waited for..... cheap mats.
B00029WYDU|5|I'm always running out of the cleaning solution before the oil solution.  So I'm glad that I can buy it separately.  Works great.
B00FDBQZCS|5|Good
B004NBO9Q8|5|Great deal ,
B0029TQDLA|1|Was not impressed hook broke off within first week
B007KOC1MO|1|WAST OF MONEY
B00EUUNJRM|3|It was good at first, but its not water proof. I have it mounted in my front bumper of my truck and after a month i noticed water in it and its now just corroding away. Most of the led's have rust on them. It still functions, but not as well. I would spend my money on one of the name brands instead. The reviews made it sound awesome, but after what I have seen, I rather just go spend a little extra for a name brand one.
B0011E2Y0I|5|Motul 600 is a great product.  I ran it in my car on a road course for a full weekend and my brakes never boiled or overheated.  The course was 3.1 miles long and my speed ranged from 40-120mph.  This is what I will run in all of my vehicles now.
B004YEIOGK|3|A little small than I expected. But good quality
B00XJN8ARA|4|It's pretty straight forward. My husband uses it for his budding PDR side business...more for the morons that keep knocking our car doors....he says it performs as any other at a better price that he managed to find it for. It contains 5 plastic tap down tips, non marring (no worse than the door that already gouged your paint for sure) and it hasn't flattened out yet. HE repaired a few already and used the pointed end..no problem. Hammer seemed sturdy and quality unlike some of the &#34;composite&#34; or cheap metal with plastic ends. I am unsure of the end materials but they aren't the cheap stuff he was afraid of. He would buy it again.
B00N0IHMXM|5|Does what it is supposed to do, fits my drill and the jacks on the camper.  Greatly simplifies the job and would be a must have for anyone who has leveling jacks.
B007V2D07U|5|Great fit and quality!
B002YKMCDW|5|Worked good!
B004UQIVPQ|2|Not entirely what its cracked up to be.  Did not remove grime off the paint surface, so resigned myself to the old standard of rubbing compound.
B00KMR3GT8|4|Very bright. I love the led pattern, haven't hooked up the reverse light yet but tested it and it seems bright. I like that the bar is flexible, makes installation a lot easier.
B0000AY2Z6|4|purchased on the recommendation of a family member who has a long commute weekly for work - and no AC!<br /><br />moves an incredible amount of air for such a low draw on a battery - if you are using it for just yourself it really helps on the 90+ day heat with high humidity in the south.<br /><br />the downsides of this particular unit:<br />1) feet/arms for hanging are poorly done and more or less worthless - our last trip 3 hours to and then back from the beach I ended up just holding it in my lap.  there was not a really good place to put it and it actually stay.  will figure something better out for the next trip to secure it somewhere<br /><br />2) price - for a box fan of this size and given what it does - seems like it should cost less<br /><br />anyway, for those with no AC in their vehicle or looking for something for recreational - this fan is an awesome option for the money!
B004GO5KVA|5|fit and looks great
B000CM3IEG|5|It's perfect
B000VKVXK0|5|worked perfectly
B00UW4DJF2|1|I wrote Brightech support months ago and have not received a response. The unit worked fine for a month before failing completely. I am rating 1 stars and awaiting a response.
B00DP5W532|4|good product they look of cheap quality but they do its job. it didnt line up properly with the body of the fenders but its ok. not a big difference.  using it for a 2007 gsxr 600.
B00YC28OUU|5|Timely delivery, seems well made, like they'll stand up to years of off-roading!! Came with the 4 handles and also 4 round holders for something... Not sure what these are for ..but thanks for the bonus pieces!
B00DZ35HES|4|So far so good. Beats pull staring my ATV!
B0002NIK34|5|Exactly as described. Tight fit on 2015 JK.
B00GBQIFH2|5|MIRRORS FIT PERFECTLY
B00KH2X8W8|5|This was so easy to re program.... I can't believe the local ford dealership wanted to charged $80 for this and to re program it. I was finished in less then 2 minutes. It was like a gream and it's been super helpful during our rainy season.
B00XMQ3HGS|4|I purchased this item based on other reviewers who stated this stainless steel trim would be better than the OEM plastic one which could break or crack. It looks good and I'm basically happy with it except that it doesn't lay completely flat on my bumper. The top part of the trim doesn't &#34;stick&#34;. The trim has a &#34;crease&#34; in it, so I had centered it on my bumper and lined it up with the &#34;crease&#34; on my rear tail, which places the trim flush against the back car lip. This would make the trim placement be closer to the front of the car, versus the rear lip of the car. Unfortunately, despite the very strong adhesive, it doesn't grip on the top side at all.  When the trunk is closed it doesn't appear that it would collect water, but it might stick better had it had been placed closer to the rear outside lip of the rear tail door. Once it is placed on the tail door outer bumper it cannot be moved, so be sure of placement.
B000COC1AG|5|Excellent product competitive pricing exact fit
B00CXZKMKS|5|Looks great on my welding helmet. Does not apply well to curved surfaces, but if you don't care too much, then it's fine on curved surfaces.
B0049GEAUC|5|I recently got into an accident (rear-ended someone) and smashed up the front of our only car. My husband, being the handy man he is, wanted to fix the radiator himself. This radiator was exactly as described and fit perfectly into the front of our Toyota Camry. I've been driving it for about 2 months now, including one long trip from Boston to D.C., and it keeps our car nice and cool. Highly recommend.
B00NPYXAWS|5|3 members of my family feel safer today. It arrived on time. My great grandchild now has more protection. We couldn't find these in our local stores. Quality and price were perfect. I do not know what you could possibly expect more in a device than this.
B00VR6Y0WK|5|Fast shipping great price
B00AFV7DI6|5|fit my 2014 ram and works great
B000CCFY5W|3|okay for a lot of vehicles, but not really intended for a 2000 Honda accord 4 cy..
B0006IX7WY|5|works great
B0006JLU22|5|I ordered 3, told a friend and ordered another, told another friend and ordered 2 more. The quality is good, easy to install and of course the price was right.
B008YFU3F0|5|Love them! Bright lights and I love how they look with my car
B00B5JJ5NI|5|Great paint, as far as paint from a can. You can also buy different tips for getting the pattern just how you want.<br />Even after a year outdoors, in direct sun, it is still nice and white.
B001OMKVHA|5|Nice scoop. I painted inside black to make it not see through which I thought looked better
B000BGHYJS|5|Shipped on time and in good packaging.  Installed it on my RV in 2 seconds.  This will stop any leakage for the main valves and the surprise when you uncap the drain cap from the end of the sewer line.
B00KX10Y5M|1|I bought this light a while back hoping it was a good light for the price,I finally put it on today and after 20 minutes it quit working. I'm very upset that out of everyone who says there's has no problems mine won't even turn on
B003Z9T24S|5|Good products
B0073T4AAW|4|Arrived fast and love the keyed locks until I needed to unlock my ice chest and the key broke in the lock and I had to cut it with some snips. They have great customer service and replaced the cable with keeping my same key code. It is hard to find something to secure the ice chest since you can not place strong chains in the mounting holes. I recommend this company.
B009OQ5G1Y|5|Bolted right on to my 04' Mazda 6. I like that it came with screws.
B002UCYRZU|5|I have never written a review on anything, but this product just saved us over $200!  Our house is old and the original owners used plexiglass as storm windows.  We recently went to wash our large living room window and scratched it in the process.  We called around to some window places and were told we couldn't fix the plexiglass.  We went online and found this product.  We thought we would give it a try before replacing our window.  It worked amazingly.  So glad we gave this a try before replacing the window!
B00M9ILEN8|5|Nice plastic. Fit well. Had to drill a couple holes bigger for ktm style screws. Air box cover on left side didn't fit as good as oem, but still worked. Shipping was quick, packaged nice and all around good deal
B006RW5NNY|5|I love the look it gives my truck
B00LFARNUO|5|Great item
B00WW75RZC|1|Getting what you pay for.<br />Frays instantly, and could only get my flat 8mm 5-wire LED wires about 7&#34; in 20 minutes before it got stuck. Mumbled profanities and an exaggerated throw into the trashcan ensued.<br />My cat was entertained by it at least, as it makes a great toy.
B00IO9C9QM|5|fit was perfect, quality was great.  shipping prompt and confirmed fitment prior to shipping
B004PQOT8Y|5|Bought mine for a Honda CM250C. Was a breeze to install and made the bike look allot better. I put mine on upside down as I dont have the rest of the bike ready for such low bars. Either way I really like the way the bike looks and sitting a bit more forward ont he bike.<br /><br />Got mine in black and it looks great!
B008N20AIY|5|Perfect
B008H5Y0VU|5|great fit & great price!!!1
B00F8KP9SA|4|only part that too a minute to figure out was HOW TO PUT THE BAR WITH ROUND HOLE PN THE TURN SCREW JUST NEEDS TO SLIDE OVER THE TOP NOT BOTTOM. other than that it was great took only a few seconds to do brake job
B000AM8BF4|4|It's charging.
B00KTHVE72|1|The inside design is different from my current one and have no use. Absolute waste of my money spending for the postage. You better have the variation in inside to be placed in with product display.
B0060A8Y0W|5|Perfect fit.
B0053O9EUA|5|Quieted down transmission , easier shifting. Neutral easier to find.
B00747MJ6U|5|Perfect
B00OG5AZ78|5|it was my above my expectation
B0006IX7YC|2|Ended up returning this item after it leaked so bad that it nearly flooded my bathroom.Good idea......  Poor design.
B0009V1WSE|4|Works perfect and great to have only one key for both locks.
B00B8ZI78S|5|Fits well.  This is a great item.
B002OQ8PV4|4|Good article.
B00B48AZWU|5|Fit perfectly on our 1996 Nissan hardbody pickup.  Long journey here from Asia but good price and quality product.
B009DK1NTU|5|Fit perfectly and came quickly
B00030BFQA|5|Good service and a good deal.
B004VLEM62|5|Replaced the passenger side bellow on my 2003 325xi a while back with a BMW OEM part. This Beck Arnley part fit just as well and seems to be of the same quality. Of note, to install this part, you will need to take off the tie rod end. The OEM part is designed to be installed without removing the tie rod.
B0082GG9FO|2|Were not the size I expected. Not happy with it, will keep it until I find the right replacement.
B00G3BRNNM|5|I swear by Royal Purple for all my car needs.
B00FFYM464|5|way earlier than expected! im in love!! they smell great!! im just worried about where to get the refills for them
B008CEU9PC|2|The seat covers did not work well for my vehicle. They were too loose in some areas and too tight on others. The company did work with me for a refund, but I was required to pay full return shopping.
B00CKCZNTY|5|Comfy
B00HDMEUCW|5|A must if you cart kids around for sports. Now they get my Happeseat dirty not my car anymore.  Then just throw it in the wash and repeat!
B009VI5TDU|5|After taking apart the primer housing to install another brand (Dorman 904-124 Primer Fuel Filter Seal Kit) which I purchased on Amazon for $15.55 I was disappointed to find that some of the Dorman seals didn't fit and were all poorly made. Unfortunately my truck was stuck till this seal kit arrived. These were perfect and I had my truck running in under a half hour. In this case you really get what you pay for - these are quality parts. Highly recommended.
B00R244E5O|2|I think I should have purchased the real product, rather than an imitation, because it just did not act like the original. It bubbles, doesn't stay adhered. Not recommended.
B001TAPLYA|5|Very satisfied, easy to install, looks good.  Light produced is acceptable.
B000S34PBY|4|good so far
B007IBIREA|5|Great
B00JHEOR2C|5|These are made from nice thick rubber.  They seem like good quality and installed without any problems.
B000GVBWY6|3|I installed this myself. Installation was simple, after doing some research and watching a couple of the youtube videos relating to the install of this ORK. The instructions that came with the kit was good, but watching the videos helped a great deal. I took the bike out for about a 30 minute ride and noticed a small oil leak at the line connection at the filter when I returned home. So I used thread sealant, waited the cure time and took the bike on a 2 hour ride a couple days later. Noticed a &#34;new&#34; leak at the diverter upon returning. when I disconnected the ORK and applied the sealant to the piping threads, I noticed that the oil was actually coming from a small hole just inside the unit and it runs down and out of the bottom screw (with the &#34;O&#34; ring in place) so I applied a small amount of sealant to the screw just before where the hole would sit once the ORK is secured in place and it worked. No more leaks. These are issues I had read up on in blogs that others experienced when installing the kit so I had expected it.
B00SZK212M|5|Very bright fog light
B00QW3IVEG|5|Awesome
B0002LAC6E|5|wonderul for dishes if cut into 3 pieces.
B00GOW6VAQ|5|Good product, good price, fast delivery.
B0058J4LK8|5|These are perfect. Easy fit, no issues, Clear enough to still smoke with Plasti-Dip.
B00BMVCMMA|4|accurate color match, easy to apply
B006QH552E|5|Excellent battery! And price for dependability.
B000G72UOQ|5|Got this because the &#34;jumbo&#34; size (generally 60&#34;x32&#34;) made by other manufacturers did not fit my minivan. It kept slipping out of place even with visors down. These fit! I like to place 1 panel on the passenger side in &#34;portrait&#34;. Then place the one on the driver side in &#34;landscape&#34; covering over the passenger side one to hold it in place. In my photo you'll see that one bends because it has to get under the rear view mirror mount. (This is the only point where the design that is 2 attached circles is better because it can get under the mirror mount easily.) Full coverage!
B00GBP80VY|5|Quality product, just as pictured. this is my third one I have bought great item
B004BPE7TA|2|I tried to find a way to get in touch with them, but had no results. When I opened the shrinkwrap around the plate, the whole thing exploded all over my floor. Crystals and colorplates went everywhere. I spent 15 minutes with a flashlight looking for all the pieces. I guess I'll have to glue them all in and hope the others don't fall out. I really liked this item, it was exactly what I was looking for.
B00GJX1NYE|5|Quality product, just as pictured
B00JKEKRKK|5|Great material and fit.
B00UCB5PXY|1|The mirror did not fit, it was smaller
B00PT423D4|5|Perfect fit!  Works great
B00KTHYCEO|5|I just bought a 2006 4Runner but it only had one set of keys. The dealer was more than happy to charge me $350 for another set. I purchased this, it arrived quickly and I saved a ton of dough. The instructions were easy and I programed it in less than 5 minutes. First try and I was done!
B00598LYWQ|5|I ran into my SUV door while moving my trailer and had a niced sized gouge (about 1/2&#34; deep by 2.5&#34; long).  This kit was perfect for repairing it.  With little effort, I was able to repair the gouge pretty well in a short period of time and at a fraction of the cost of going to a repair shop.  I'm fairly handy, but I think most people could use this product reasonably well.  The gouge repair itself is mostly unnoticeable (I could probably go back and add a little more Bondo if I wanted to) - although the paint color/finish is slightly different (but that isn't the Bondo's fault).  There was an adequate amount of product in the package and the kit was complete for doing the full repair (other than paint).  I have full confidence that the product will be durable - it seems very comparable to epoxy wood filler.
B001K9JO5C|5|Exactly what I needed.
B005RJ3GBE|4|good replacement for original key.
B005C5CY5W|5|The product came on time of was of high quality. So far it is functioning good. The Waverunner has only been used once, so far so good.
B0023VFB2G|5|On time and intact. Fit well, looks the same as factory. Can't beat half off dealer prices and a 10 minute install.<br /><br />Another review said the colors were a little off and they were, so I replaced the new bulbs with my old ones and the colors are the same.
B002P8TRAO|4|Its working perfectly, nice fit
B001QUDVWW|5|put in but was not the problem, rear pump split in half
B00IP7C328|5|Little more plastic that I expected but they work really well.
B0001XPC7C|5|The pictures are true to size and appearance. Great product! I hate having a messy car console with a bunch of spare change flying everywhere so this was a perfect solution. Would buy again or for a friend!
B00GDFBM6C|5|Great product!
B00757IGYS|3|This definitely stopped the wobbly antenna. However, there are a couple of local stations we cannot get now. Weird. We get all of the other stations, but we do not get the two closest ones.
B0069VY4LU|2|The appearance is very good, but installation is a nightmare, two hours and I only had one screw in place, so I took it off, to try another time.
B00308BTO0|5|Love this charm & so does my car!
B00HXJ5KEM|5|Excellent, well engineered all season mats.  Are genuine Kia products and a decent price that won't break the bank.  I really like the deep tread that traps the gravel so it doesn't stay stuck to the bottom of your shoes.  Edging is also well made as it is deep enough not to let fluids over flow.  The other thing I really love is that they all have attachments to secure the mats to the floor of the vehicle.  That is a huge bonus.
B004GFS2C8|5|did its job, fixed the crack in the windshield.
B000C2WF9A|5|I love this product and it fit perfectly on my 2013 Dodge Challenger. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. I have no complaints.
B001JT1CEE|5|Great colored wire!
B00EUUNJRM|5|Product is really good
B003V0GG18|5|I previously purchased these for my Mini Cooper. I like them so much I ordered these for my new Toyota Avalon Hybrid
B002E387KG|5|Fit on my 1995 gmc 1500 great price
B001BNFVFE|5|Great look very cool
B00164YVDQ|5|Nice replacement for stock black filler cap.perfect fit.
B000CQI1BC|5|outstanding i have no complain it is working very good
B003FY57DS|4|i have an older jeep. the plastic windows were getting dingy. i applied the raggtopp plastic cleaner and they look so much better.i highly recommend this product.
B00120KDGI|5|Easy to put on....work great.
B007V2BXVK|5|This is my fourth Covercraft heat shield. These fit perfect and work great. Superior craftsmanship.
B0090W09Q4|5|fit perfect and work good,thanks
B000CQQKGU|1|who ever welded this had to be drunk!  its crooked and im sending it back as it might tow my new trailer badly . reese is a brand name and very disapointed  in this quality
B00GYTEC14|5|Good thing I cleaned this thing out...does the job its supposed and fit my 08 enclave perfect.
B000NDL80K|5|A++++
B00J1TI0AI|3|Not exactly what I ordered but it will work. I wanted black but got a carbon fiber look grill. 2 of the 4 clips don't fit as they should so I will have to modify it to fit snug.
B008Y6V0BK|5|Good size. Came fast. Thank .
B000E7YP82|5|Worked Great.
B009DJQ1ZC|5|Item was exactly as described, and fit my Toyota RAV4 perfectly.  Have had it on my vehicle after installing it myself for about 5 days now, and the new muffler was exact match for the initial factory muffler.  No complaints, a happy customer who would look for this company to do business with again.  Will do an update about the quality of the muffler after a few months, and see how it holds up through a New England winter.  Thanks...
B00BTSI9DW|3|Purchased for an F-150, remote and transponder work fine. The quality of the key is not the best. The case has a large gap around edge of the remote portion and feels loose.
B0052SJVGY|5|I used this part on a 2012 Volkswagen Routan. This part would work on a 2009+ Volkswagen Routan and likewise a 2009-2013 (at least) Chrysler van and is part of the overall locking mechanism that the dealer will sell you. The original part lasted 55k miles for me with lots of locks and unlocks. The replacement process is a bit tricky, but can be done if you have researched it on YouTube and have a mechanical mind. Took me about 5 hours from start to finish, but the dealer wanted $1,500 to fix the door and I did it in less than $100.
B00AKWTGSK|3|Look nice, but are flimsy and seem to sit crooked on my pedals.
B000GU24J4|4|So far so good stays on nice bike stays dry
B00CFBV7X6|3|the pulley and the belt worked great.  The tensioner was not like OEM.  IT would require a separate tool to loosen the tension that I did not have so I could not use this part.
B000CII6JM|4|great stuff
B007IY8YK4|5|Its awesome<br />It fits my phone perfectly
B001DPDIG4|5|Love them!!!! They fit and look GREAT!!!!!
B00YIA2VH8|3|I find it doesn't flatten out when put in the window.  The shade has creases from being folded so it is shorter in length.
B007G4E770|3|Their are no instructions in English
B00C0SQUZE|5|Simple easy installation. 2&#34; hole slides in and locks securely.
B00NPIUFMM|3|Will not seat completely. Keeps working itself out of the socket till it falls out.
B00946SF7Q|2|Very light weight tin.  Just touch it and the plate is bent.  Mine bent in the wind on the car.  Not worth the price.  It pays to be able to see, touch and feel some products.
B000HLQB5K|4|Fit a 2008 LMM Duramax pickup.  Note that there is NO PUMP in this module; the Bosch injector pumps suck fuel. There is no electric or mechanical fuel pump near the fuel tank.  Be sure to get the AC Delco TR26 locking ring as the old one will most likely need to be cut off due to rust.
B003SG431U|1|Was very disappointed in the fit and the quality.
B00651CLCS|5|This is a great product
B00LAFLXB4|5|This is a perfect fit. Looks oem. Perfect for worn out or broken remote bodies.
B00AXOI7NA|3|The fit is okay. Easy to install, but don't stay put. They are very sticky in the summer, and ANY leather product such as a belt will leave a mark on the seat cover. It won't on normal leather. I thought based on the price and reviews they would be much better than something you can get a Walmart for under $30.
B00BCR5ZUA|1|These did not look or fit very well. They look cheap.
B001TZLV6M|3|I purchased this to go with the U-Pol Raptor Liner kit but unfortunately those specific bottles do not screw on this gun. I'm not sure what does because nothing is referenced as to what it will work with. It did a fine job spraying the liner but I had to use two hands the whole time to hold the bottle under the gun. Also this does not include the fitting to attach to the compressor hose. Have to buy that separate.
B002BHWZFI|2|Using it on the inside of my Gear VR headset and it only lasts a day at most until I have to reapply. When it does work it works quite well, though I have to reapply it each time I used the headset. And, yes, I have let it dry, applied several coats, etc. and still get the same short lasting result.  If you're looking for something that works AND lasts for more that a day then this is not for you.
B002UKS7QW|5|Good size, has lasted well through different types of weather.
B003TQEXSM|5|Excellent product fast shipping
B00KTIE7CA|5|great price, great color, great replacment, great service/install guidance!!!
B00ACW2WUM|5|Fit was perfect.
B00KY0B4FQ|5|it has been 3 weeks since I had my mechanic install this alternator. Everything is in fine working order. Glad I made this purchase!
B00BLZA7GK|5|Great product. Works on 2011 Scion tC.
B001EOYJSU|5|Sturdy hitch. Simple design. Just be ready to lay under your car and drill a couple holes and partially take off the exhaust. At least I had to with my Subura Forrester.
B002SINBRQ|4|Good gauge, pretty sure at this price you are not getting cooper core wires, but copper clad.  I'm pretty confident for that one time in 10 years I need to use this that won't be an issue.  Overall seems like a good quality.  The storage bag is flimsy and the zipper broke after one pull, plan on getting a bucket boss one or something similar if you want to keep it it a pouch.
B00RKN6342|5|Quick and easy to install looks better I expected
B000C1QOGQ|5|Works great
B00D1CQVIY|5|easy wire kit.  good instructions.  relay could be located in a slightly different location.<br />wires aren't long enough.  but not a real big issue
B00SZ1GLHM|1|This china part is not near the original part quality. It caught on itself operating and bent part of one arm to the point of unrepairable. I took the old part and welded the bad tooth to get the window working.
B00F536ABU|5|works as described.
B000F3RYGA|5|Looks like the only way to remove this without a key would be a blow torch.  I wonder what a sledge hammer would do to this?  Not willing to find out and hope I never have to.
B001GRXPT4|5|Good fit just need to make sure your drill battery is full b4 you start.
B00H7LPKKU|5|Used by my brother for lubing my farm equipment.  As a construction machinery mechanic he was very impressed!
B0049MCU12|5|Excellent product and delivery
B00ZVJ35XE|3|Double check that it will work for your vehicle.  It's an OK product for the price, it will keep your seats clean, but I don't think it will be very durable.
B00NFA8NRE|5|Great product. Easy install. Packaging is ok.
B0057088SE|5|Thank you
B0051NNIFU|5|Awesome cover and easy to install
B00R1DDPAQ|4|it is a nice key chane
B004GCANWS|3|Bumper looks great, although there was a problem with a few of the holes not lining up and had to drill them out to fit.
B002ZTI5YM|5|Great quality and a perfect fit.
B003UT3S6Q|5|Excellent product. Recommended to everyone.
B000CF6RX2|5|Very good window guards!
B00KGIDT54|5|Got it fits perfect, forgot to order gasket. Has to make 1
B00J62XIZM|4|Fit my 2014 ram 1500 quad cab perfect they are definitely not as strong as the ones from ram though but for the price they are awsome!
B00IS95BHW|1|Unfortunately there were no reviews to warn me about this product. It is a single piece of plastic with double sided tape to cover your existing gas door. I have a 2007 Ram 2500. The existing gas door has a hinged flap. If I stuck this over the cover I would never be able to access my gas tank. Useless for me. Not sure why anyone would want to eliminate access to fuel....
B001P2A6TW|4|Heavy duty.
B00R1J5O2M|5|Fits perfectly
B002SZSC5K|3|works well
B00KSDKWZ2|4|Nice fit and look but $14.99 would be a more resonable price for what it is.
B004HE563Q|5|Factory brakes for my vehicle. Fit perfect and are working just great. Very pleased with cost and delivery. Comes with clips for the slides.
B00JTUBTU2|5|great stuff
B00355MW0I|5|Works great, and now I can hang my roof panel securely and get it out-of-the-way.
B00CYLKBUM|5|Excellent. Fits both of my autos with plenty of room to spare. The rubbery backing prevents cover from sliding around when you get in the car. I tried another terrycloth cover sold at Amazon for $10 but it is only 46&#34; long which does not fully cover the seats.
B0093KV28C|4|Fits perfectly.  Amazing how dirty the cabin filter gets in 15,000 miles!
B002H5I17A|5|Love it! Threw my ol' K&N in the trash after this. Still scratching my head why i didn't do it sooner. Big difference over the K&N. BTW i had put this in my 02' F250 7.3l
B00KLKEWH6|4|It is well made replacement case for my old broken one. However the claim that this unit glows in the dark is slightly overstated.  But my main idea was to replace my old one that was well beaten down and for this price, I am happy with my purchase.
B001O2ZT90|2|Problem with fill tip fell apart
B0006MRRY4|5|Fits nicely in the end of my slinky sewer hose so I could add additional length, but more importantly it helps keep the end of the hose in the hole without adding extra diameter. Screws on easily. Very solid product.
B00M1Y3NL6|5|Atf4....great price
B00LKP3ZD8|5|excellent replacement for the factory plastic junk that comes on the bike
B00D9C2CDO|5|I loved this thing, I bought it because i needed some extra space for camping. It fit the mold perfectly, I have a 2012 GMC terrian and it fit nicely on my roof rack. I was able to fit the luggage of 4 people in the bag and also some sleeping backs and pillows. I'm very pleased.
B007F0RJ3O|5|This is a very nice trunk rubber cover. It fits my Prius 2011 really well and it is half or the price of other similar products. Really good quality rubber!
B000UK3RT6|5|This plug is going in my Yamaha vine 125cc
B00E5UCXL0|5|I've been wearing the same novelty helmet for decades but over the past couple years I've gotten tickets &#34;because we (police) are concerned for your safety.&#34;  The last trooper told me I no longer have an excuse for wearing a helmet thats not DOT because of the new Kevlar helmets. Well I went right to Amazon and bought one for me and one for my gal. These were inexpensive and turned out to be light and comfortable on long rides. The look is still goofy but not as bad as most DOTs. My usual hat size is 7 7/8 and the XXL fit me best if thats any help.
B00Y5HRHS2|1|Ball too large not comfortable when shifting
B000GTTDFI|4|Great set of bushings, sturdy and no play on the bars.
B010JRK79W|1|Don't waist ur money, they don't stick to the aluminum on the door frame, my wife almost lost them while driving in the highway.The ones of the back don't really fit they are short. It was a waste for me.
B0058J4RL6|4|Nice, bright LEDs.  Eliminates the frequent replacement of the incandescent CMHSL (3rd brake light) bulb, which has been the only part I've had to replace more than once in 8-1/2 yrs/155k miles of owning my 4Runner.  Would have been 5 stars if the fit was better.  Had to use some silicon to create a seal so that water doesn't come into the tailgate around the assembly.
B00U02PQR0|5|Excellent directions.
B00144D77E|5|Very good quality and good instructions on what everything was very easy to hook up worked great
B0091QKRD4|5|great helmet
B00XAX4B9A|5|Works great and easy to use!!!
B005OVCP4E|5|It's an OEM part that helped me out of a jam. I've had installed about 1&1/2 yrs now. Matched up with my vehicle mounts. Works great!
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Pretty bright but more of a beam like a really bright flashlight but still nice and they look cool
B007K22W7K|5|Look great on my car and it wasn't  too difficult  to install. Alignment was a little more  difficult  but not too terrible
B000IY8OKQ|2|it worked but the plugs felt cheap and the plugs did not seal the top of the engine 100% like my old ones. I chose NGK because I wanted premium spark plugs for my 99 integra. I didn't get what I thought I was getting. one of the spark plug rubber retainers slipped off. It probably wasn't glued properly. It still worked but not the NGK experience I wanted.
B004GZKV4K|4|fit and looks great directions were a little iffy though all in all satisfied with this product.
B00K8SG1NE|4|fitment was outstanding
B000IPAK9S|5|Excellent quality. Came priorty 2 day free shipping.
B00M8TB5HS|5|They come in quick and fit almost perfect!
B00DJBQ1SW|5|Awesome arrived early loaded my rider lawnmower mo slips going up the ramp dropped it off no slips down folded them up nicely and drove home where I drove a snowblower up for delivery no slips and dropped it off no issues. Light weight and stood the test. Folded up for easy storage.
B00DJBGB50|5|Exactly what I was looking for. I received the platform in a very timely manner.
B00BC3727S|5|After being extremely disappointed from a competitor's helmet, I can gladly say that this thing delivers! No mushroom head, FINALLY!<br /><br />I've got a big ole head (I usually wear a 2XL, although the XL fit me here), and most open face helmets look right goofy on me. Not this one! Sleek, low and looking cool. Thanks guys!
B006ZIE9LW|5|Great product, great quality!
B00RMHTRKS|5|Very useful, and it could save your life
B00A2VC9YC|5|It came in a timely manner and was very easy to program with the instructions! I have already recommended this to others!
B00BNFVQ6I|5|Excellent
B00KHUQAY8|4|It's very nice quality the only thing it was the wrong size
B00F9W60O4|5|Looks great on my ranger frends all want a set
B00MBPTEEK|4|Good looking decals, it is of course because its Jake
B00UR8960K|2|Pictures look nothing like they do online. Nowhere near as sharp/crisp. Colors are not bold. Images are blurry... I was pretty disappointed...
B00AQ4VOZA|4|Great
B000IZ4AD0|5|Good
B003BZD03K|5|Works great.  Easy to turn and seals up perfect
B008RAFJ38|5|I'm not the most artistic person when it comes to using silicone sealants, so I thought I would give the lube locker gasket a try.<br />Good simple installation instructions, 2 step torque sequence. No leaks, No mess. These gaskets aren't cheap, but they are great gaskets and<br />they can be reused.
B008R099CA|5|I purchased one pair and after I received and used them;  I ordered a second pair.  Great value.
B00SI6NXYS|3|Was purchased for a friend.  As far as I know she is happy with it.  It was received timely.
B00FZE2U72|5|Unique and funny
B00NB378EE|3|1st time I have used them so will have to wait and see.
B00CBQFE8Y|5|Worked perfectly, self-programmed after about 10-15 minutes of driving on a highway.
B00JIIZCM6|4|Great product.  Works well
B0055DNWAC|5|Delivered quickly. Fit perfectly on my 06 Polaris Sportsman 800. No complaints. Good transaction!
B0013LF3ES|5|as described works on the Pacific Coast
B002L1GWX0|5|Seems like this fixed my speedometer problem for the most part. Haven't got any speeding tickets since I put it in.
B00WXV07Z2|5|Beautiful light,  high and low beam....<br />I get alot of comments on how cool it is.<br />As for seller. . i had originally received wrong light,  (crap happens) but what was great,  was that the seller very quickly responded to my email,  and even quicker,  rectified the mix up.<br />I give the light and the seller 10 stars.
B00JM5ZGWG|5|They were very easy to put on my vehicle and looks freat
B006DDHZ1K|5|brought back the new vehicle performance @ 50k miles!
B00WAORNAY|2|two days after  mounting on car the rear drivers side blew off leaving the glue tape still on car

B003TFE81U|3|Once used, stretched and no longer fits on reel!
B009D4RPQ6|5|Adds a clean look to the interior very happy with my purchase
B00BR1R8N8|4|worked great .
B00CNEQZHS|5|Good quality, works great. Standard shipping was slow. Overall good experience.
B00ITF0P7G|4|Very nice product. However, our state registration sticker would have been obscured. Have to use on the front of car until next year when we can adjust the placement of our new sticker.  Just consider when purchasing.
B0041LN1L4|4|Hope I never have to find out how good it is.
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Very handy and worked perfectly for me keeping the GPS going on my motorcycle trip. I'll be getting another one for my other bike.
B00AWRZ8I0|3|high priced!!!!!!!!!! cheaper helmets are better quality
B0002Z9QWQ|5|I've been using these wiper blades for probably 10 years on at least 4 different vehicles of my own.  I've recommended them and installed them on all of my nearby family's vehicles also.<br /><br />I have never heard a single complaint from anyone.  In fact, everyone who has installed them has kept the same pair on their windshield for 12 months or more - I know this because I'm the one who eventually replaces them.  They all ask &#34;what was the name of those really good wiper blades you get again?&#34;  And I tell them... Which turns in to me eventually helping them buy and install them.<br /><br />I don't know why there are so many negative reviews for these blades.  If you choose to buy these, drive through a car wash then apply the applicator pad thoroughly to your windshield before installing the blades.  That's all I ever do and I've never had a problem and neither has my wife, mom, dad, or grandparents. I have no intention of ever buying another brand/style of blade.<br /><br />Feel free to check my review history if you think I'm just trying to sell you something.
B000C93ECK|3|I had the exact same problem as the other reviewer - the tailpipe was coming up way too high!!<br />Plus I bought the front muffler too (Walker 52171 Quiet-FlowSS Muffler Assembly) hoping that it will be hassle free install.  Had to go out twice to buy longer bolts and nuts to try and adjust it.  Not the ideal situation, because now it hangs too low in the mid section and rattles on the cross bar between the two mufflers.<br />My car is a Jetta 1998, and it was supposed to be the &#34;right fit&#34;.  Can't tell if the problem is with the actual Walker 54037 design, or if this is a replacement part - there were no branding other than a little sticker.  And it is Made in China! Don't know if that's the case for all Walker stuff.
B000C36BVC|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B0004ELKC4|5|I have a black Mustang GT and found that 303 works great on keeping the rubber lower plastic trim looking like new. It also makes it easier to clean
B000C9FUAE|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B001UYZ9JC|2|Has a nice sound.  Product didn't fit.  My friends and I had to cut and add a flex pipe because the angle was wrong and it was short.  Only getting a 2 based on price.  If you're not great with tools I wouldn't suggest getting this for your car.
B00CMIUW7O|5|Love this decal!
B00A19JNG2|5|Great Price
B00LNOK4E4|5|They look awesome! Thank you!
B00W4B4PVS|4|It worked just find once we found the instructions to program, which were not with the key fob!
B003ADGENQ|5|Very nice!
B00DJ5KE9U|5|It does take a while to charge up a dead battery. You'll need to be patient. It took me 48 hours to notice the status light changed. Dead battery hadn't been used for 2+ years.
B009LISBT4|5|Great price.
B00LH4MA3I|1|Didn't fit.... trouble  with frount fenders
B0031XULF2|5|Easy to lock and unlock.  Seems like it would be a total PITA to remove for a would-be thief.  Of course, no one has tried to steal my ATV yet so I can't really say how it would work.  I really don't want to find out.
B000GZBZOE|5|Fits good
B00HFX38U4|5|It is a great product one of the best tire gauges i have own
B0034G2IFC|3|will need to slightly modify your rad support. Dremmel small lip. small part.
B00L2T481K|5|Just as advertised.
B00029XC7M|5|Excellent.
B002ZS4QCS|5|Great
B00CEPV94U|5|Very easy to install. Works great on my 2005 Toyota Sienna.
B001TXWNLQ|3|Does not work at all.
B004BWU8H8|4|Made of heavy metal with a nice finish. Installs very easy with simple instructions. I plan on buying one more for the passenger side.
B0081SD3Z2|5|good product good price good buy,will purchase more of this item.
B00631E14Q|5|10/10 for the price,
B00Q8BGQ6C|5|Very bright excellent choice wouldn't hesitate to buy it again if I needed
B009MP9WAI|5|Ordered my second pair. First pair lasted me 2+ years before I wore a hole in the thumb from using the turn signal
B00CNEQZHS|5|So far they work great. perfect fit
B006P2K57K|1|This is false advertising at it's best, these are not xenon hid, they are yellow coated halogen lamps.<br />If they were HID where is the ballast and why do I see filaments in the capsules.
B00QW3H9NK|5|Fits in snug. About 20 min to install. Left upper side needs a little force to line up, but once lined up looks, flawless.
B00V337VNM|5|Look great, quick delivery
B00XIYASDO|5|This is vey unique and eye catching kay chain.<br />Awesome!!!
B00S7ONHH4|5|This tool quickly and easily solved my problem of resetting an SMS Air Bag dashboard light on my 2004 BMW 325XI sedan. I had replaced a faulty window regulator in my driver side door, and while performing that repair, I had temporarily disconnected and removed the drivers side airbag to avoid damaging it.  After I finished the repair, I realized that I had generated a fault code for the air bag that I was unable to reset using any of my other tools. The Lemur BlueDriver - It's a great product, but it could not read nor reset the airbag light. The Garmin EcoDrive - Another great product, but it could not read nor reset the airbag light. Another generic code reader also was unsuccessful in reading nor resetting the airbag light. The C110 scanner worked on the first attempt.  It does the job! The manual for the unit falls short of excellent, but the software menus on the unit are intuitive and were not difficult (for me) to understand (I  am not an auto mechanic).  The unit seems sturdy and well built.  The protective carry case is made of a durable nylon, has a zipper closure, and keeps the unit protected and neatly organized with its manual, software CD, and USB cable (used for upgrading the code).  Updated code and a PDF file of the users manual is available on the szcreator.com website.  The cost is very reasonable, considering it's a specialized tool with a color display, is well built, and most of all, it does things that other diagnostic tools I have cannot/will not do. Overall, I am very pleased with its performance, and have absolutely no regrets for purchasing it.
B00HTSCB1W|5|Good quality, exactly as described, like it so ordered another
B010MHV00O|5|This works well in my 2015 Outback with a 32-ounce HydroFlask. It's not a completely tight fit in the cupholder even using the sizing rings and non-slip strip, but it's close enough: it stays in place with a bottle in it, and doesn't rattle around when there's no bottle. The bottle does lean when cornering sharply (as shown in the demo video on the Bottle Pro Web site), but has never fallen out. Just don't expect to use it with a tall container that doesn't have a lid.
B00CZE12TM|4|Product works well.  It arrived quickly and easy to install.  One of the ballast was faulty, but customer service was good and exchanged quickly at no cost.  Light looks great and increases visibility.
B00823FSRC|4|Bought two of the solid tire version a bit ago and was able to use them this past weekend. The family absolutely loved them!, I'm stingy with 5 stars so for me 4-stars is a great review. I also would highly recommend the cart.  We have a couple of 14' kayaks and used these to haul the kayaks from our campsite to the lake. not a real far distance but a distance we would have to stop 3 or 4 times while carrying them. With the carts we made the trek in short order. The carts rolled easily over the campsite grasses, smoothly over a pea-gravel pathway, they bogged down on loose beach sand especially when loaded with extra gear (carried an easy-up with us for shade), but still manageable by my teenaged daughter,  then rolled well on more damply-packed sand.<br />Many reviews of the carts have expressed frustration with the smells from the tires of the inflatable version, these (the non pneumatic tires) didn't have an objectionable smell. we opened the boxes inside the house anticipating we might be taking them outside, but found there was not an unpleasant smell from them. I believe if kept within the specified weight, these will last for a long time.
B00KH8M40E|5|great replacement for the travel trailer.  had minor adjustment to the fitting that came with the assembly, but was not a big deal.
B00TR6I2H6|5|Items worked great.
B00NGEQYDE|1|Outer Foam came unglued at the seam after 2 weeks of being on bike. Now the inter foam is starting to come apart where it meats the rubber
B011BVEHYG|5|as described and worked for my purpose.  I used this in my new holland combine to plug in an aftermarket video camera system that I installed.  I cut off the standard cigarette lighter end and spliced my wires directly.  Works great.
B00651CLCS|2|Buy it for looks, toss it for reception. Degrades even the strongest signals in Tampa. Not sure how much the dual male nipple degrades the signal, or if designed to the wrong wavelength, but definetly weakens your reception. More static, and you can see the radio station strength setting flicker on the display. Will be looking for alternative with same premise, but without two piece application.
B0061R1KCI|4|These are a perfect fit for my '11 F150 Lariat. I like that they pop up when needed but stay down and out of the way the rest of the time. They were easy to install but one of the screws was defective (the top was only partially formed so you couldn't put a screwdriver to it). I went to the hardware store and bought a new screw for next to nothing. Not sure how these will hold up as water, ice and snow get into them but I guess I'll find out this winter. They look factory installed and I'm fairly happy.
B0044B0ZEW|4|Fits alright. A bit pricey compared to the aftermarket ones.
B005TTZADE|5|Could not keep the bolts tight on the fixed links from Rock Krawler. These did the trick.
B009F590L6|5|A Reese quality product, well made and a good price. The hardware kit made for an easy installation as well.
B004AQVFHW|5|Exactly as described. Fast Shipping. Thank you!
B000BZJ9Q0|5|This product met my needs. It is a fine product that fit my vehicle and is still working as i write this review. I would recommend this product<br />to anyone in need of it. It came by mail in just 3 days. Thanks Mike Mc
B003D2DX6U|5|Purchased this to replace a squeaky/grindy fan on a Flex-a-lite 678 kit that I installed on my truck ~6 years ago.  The install was pretty quick and painless.  I guess the old fan had been gradually increasing in volume over time, because I couldn't get over how -quiet- this thing sounded (at least, compared with the old fan) when I finally started the truck back up and turned on the AC.  Six years, from an electric motor that lives in a vehicle that spends a lot of time sitting (as this tends to allow accumulation of corrosion on bearing surfaces) in an area known for regular fog (also not very friendly to the bearings)?  No complaints, here, certainly
B005G0ZS9W|5|Awesome tail lights! It adds a nice touch to my Corvette showcar. Very pleased with look and style. KJM
B000BUU5YA|5|Got here just in time for my trip.  Worked like it was supposed to.
B00KAV9EDS|4|This works great for me. This is for personal use, I'm not a car mechanic. So for what I need it for it is great. It cleared the SRS light that I couldn't after I fix the problem on a Hyundai Accent.
B00B5OB7O8|3|THERE OK VERY EASY TO BREAK
B00IUWLZMW|5|Gre a T customer service.  First battery  led screen didn't work, they got me a new one asap and it's holding up well
B00GHSGRF6|5|Good
B000FAIFWU|5|It's a good product for the price.
B002SSKFGG|4|Works good, only problem was that I had to take the relay off the old one so I could use the wall switch. I thought this one came with it.
B00RDGUFPE|2|Great looking product.  Just didn't fit our 2015 Polaris Desert Edition.
B00PJPHEBO|5|This thing is great!! I can see exactly what is going on with my car.  I had an engine light on and was able to reset it.  I can monitor engine performance live wiith an app called Torque Pro.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
B00CXUF0XM|5|It was very eaay to install. Took abiut 45 minutes after reviewing Video
B000CINVA6|5|Spring time and all my windows got sprayed. Windows slide much easier. Always good to have a full can around. I like it better that other sprays. Seems to last longer at least on the windows.
B009X1X91O|5|Spicer is great quality. Haven't installed yet but I don't expect any problems
B00FN2P11S|4|quite a bit of work but fit nicely,  blocks hood emblem
B008P0WL0O|5|great...
B00G23Y37U|5|Great products
B0011Z98Q0|3|too bad doesnt have a cord or something to tied around when is very windy..
B0007WWUQS|5|fits jack perfectly gives the right lift
B00HNKYD0I|1|Horrible. It does not  stay on and leaves a horrible glue on. I hope the glue comes off...
B003NBFKDK|4|Helps for extra carriage, even when camping we carried our coolers on this.  Sturdy.  We bought the amigo hitch cargo carrier bag when we have to cover luggage so this carrier provides what we needed.
B00NO5PZZS|1|The pic shows 4 pieces and you get 2...
B00W2HW2L4|4|Very nice product. Worked as described. Would have given 5 stars but the product badges peeled off right way. Great shipping time.
B000CIKJMY|5|does the job
B000FW7V50|5|Use it every tankfull
B00OZ0SWC4|5|The lights meet my expectations. The reverse lights are very bright!!! Almost like having headlights on the back of my fifth wheel. I have to admit I wish the tail/brake lights had as many diodes as the reverse lights, but they are bright enough. They fit in a 4.5&#34; hole and the fit is really tight...I used a little liquid soap on the grommet and light to get the light into the grommet. Also, I was replacing Glo-Brite lights with a screwed in retaining ring and the grommet with these lights covers up the screw holes.
B0007D5DZC|5|Speedy delivery, products as advertised
B000UVUAFO|2|Does work that well and the scratches return. Would not purchase
B001FEOQQO|5|Installed on Kodiak 5500 RV chassis.  Stabilized the vehicle and improved the ride.  Highly recommend.
B00N3VYMJ8|5|After a rotator cuff and a torn bicep repair, this has helped to get my driving back. Now that I'm better, it's fun to use.  works really well..
B00AKXCLO0|1|Not white it's blue
B00KQSLBCW|1|Bought this from mister electric 9 months ago after the original finally gave out after 8 years. The new one has gone bad shorting out the whole bike , the wiring was backwards when i received it. Not HAPPY !!! The 1/2 star is for the prompt shipping of a junk part
B00IOT4RSA|1|Looks and feels cheap.  The free blink credit works on very few machines, since almost NONE work and are out of service here in San Diego.
B000E2CVEM|5|Nice and cheap!
