B00006AUIG|5.0|If you're looking for a blood-spattered hack fest, you will be sorely disappointed. However, if you want to see one smart, scary, chilling, freaky film that literally relies on the very last line of the movie to blow you over, this is it. There's a strong 'Shining' influence here, but it's no rip-off. Everything here is right--from the performances to digital photography, the locations to the script. The mental hospital, much like the Overlook Hotel, is one of the biggest stars here; And while you have to wait for the major carnage to ensue, it's worth it; And it actually means something. Remember when movies actually took time to build into something? This one does. Or at least to me. The last line still sends shivers down my spine everytime I watch...
B000BJ7BCK|3.0|What if there was a school for children with super powers? That is the premise for 2005's `Sky High', the live action family comedy from The Wonderful World of Disney.  <br />Will Stronghold is the son of the greatest Super Hero couple on the planet, the most anticipated new student at the secret super hero academy. The is only one small problem; Will has not developed any powers of his own, and has gone to great lengths to hide that fact from his well meaning, but ultimately egotistical father. If that weren't enough, Will also has to contend with living up to his father's reputation, falling in love, and meeting his very own arch enemy. What follows is an out of the ordinary mix of standard high school angst and comic book fantasy.  <br /> <br />Though the plot is a little thin and often predictable, the characters and tired clichés of most high school comedies are played for new laughs as the students are divided into cliques of `Hero's' and `Sidekicks' (though they prefer the term `Hero Support').  <br /> <br />The cast of teen's is comprised of many fresh faces, but the supporting cast includes in varying degrees, Kurt Russell, Kelly Preston, Bruce Campbell (Evil Daed), Kevin McDonald (Kids In The Hall), Cloris Leachman (Young Frankenstein), and Linda Carter who still looks like she could jump into her invisible jet and save the day as Wonder Woman. Dave Foley (New Radio) steals nearly every seen he is in as the long suffering side kick, er, Hero Support `All American Boy' to Kurt Russell's  `Commander'. <br />  <br />Most kid's under twelve will probably love this movie (my seven year old did), any kids older than that will probably find it a little too nice and cheerful. As far as good clean family fun, you really can't beat it. The language is clean, and the sexual content is limited to a few kissing scenes. <br /> <br />Overall Rating: B (solid) <br />Recommendation: Rent it, then decide if you want to buy it <br />
0792164903|4.0|Ahh - the perfect Halloween film!  Better than many of the old classics. This is Tim Burton at his best.  As a child, I loved the gothic tale of the Headless Horseman - and this rendition never fails to ring the bell.  Johnny Depp is well cast as the somewhat nervous, eccentric, but always ernest Ichabod Crane.  Christina Ricci is beautiful and Christopher Walken is perfect as the Horseman. Christopher Lee (Dracula) appears in a cameo role as does a noncredited Martin Landau.  Miranda Richardson is delicious and one might imagine that she thoroughly enjoyed playing her role.    While the film is gory - after all there are lots of heads being lopped off - it's not really scary.  I wouldn't recommend it for children under the age of 10 however - especially those with overactive imaginations. The old animated Disney version is better suited for the little ones.       The cinematography is marvelous - watch for the changes from the vibrant red Cardinal in the beginning to the near black and white motif in Sleepy Hollow. Superb fantasy, great score by Danny Elfman, and a thrilling ride through the forest.  Turn off the lights, get out the popcorn, and enjoy the fun. I'd give it 4.5 stars. As with all films today, this is best seen in widescreen (\\"Letterbox\\").
B00005UK1F|4.0|This album if you have not yet gathered consists of one peice of music. On some editions the peice has been split into tracks , but it is still just one peice of music. <br />   It starts off with some samples and acoustic guitars, light drums and clean vocals. This sets the mood for the album. It is a dark reflective peice of music, yet this is not doom metal, nor does it get particularily heavy or fast at any point. <br />  The Song is a series of passages and twists and turns. Passages are repeated and referred back to in various places so the listener can grab some sense of familiarality, and it ends much like it finishes. But inbetween there is many parts, some good riffs and some nice vocal parts, both clean and black metal inspired.  <br /> <br />   This peice however is not about choruses and riffs, it is about atmosphere and mood and it creates these very well.A dark reflective song it can engulf the listener as it evolves and changes, builds up to false climaxes and unexpected changes. <br />   It could be  perhaps more varied, yet like i said the peice sets a mood and it does so very well. Even so, there is a fair amount of textures and dynamics here, ranging from picked acoustic guitars, to double pedals and distorted guitars, to (original) clean vocal, to black metals vocals, to tense string-like riffs even to saxaphone solos and female scat singing. <br />  The lyrics are about the fall into insanity which add to the musical depth of the album. <br /> <br />this album is worth buying if you are into intelligent metal at all, opeth, agalloch, black metal, katatonia etc... <br /> <br />In short, this is not a novelty project, it is a complete peice as a whole (even though it is part 1 of a later sequal) with a varied soundscape and use of dynamics. Heavy at times, darkly beautiful at others. <br /> <br />worth hearing if you are into metal / rock / experintal or just have an ear for good music <br /> <br />thankyou
B00005JPAD|2.0|I don't know why Marty wanted to do a re-make of the Infernal Affair. <br /> <br />The first half of the movie was actually pretty decent. Unfortunately, the second half was a complete copy of IA part 1 with a bit of the IA part 3 injected in, down to a lot of the direct translation of the original dialogue. The ending for Matt Damon was a complete joke. <br /> <br />Get the original part 1 and 2, but forget about part 3.
B000GUJZ4G|4.0|Generally panned by critics upon its release, Point Break has gone on to enjoy something of a minor cult following among action film fans who enjoy its breathlessly choreographed action sequences involving daring bank heists, car chases, skydiving and, of course, surfing - one of the film's most important selling points. The film came along after Patrick Swayze's phenomenal success with Ghost and he went completely in the opposite direction with this film. Point Break also proved to be a warm-up for Keanu Reeves who would become a full-fledged action hero with Speed a few years later.<br /><br />Point Break trots out and downright revels in stereotypes: Utah is the all-American good guy, Pappas is the burn out cop and they are constantly being chewed out by their jerk-off boss (McGinley) for their screwball antics. Surprisingly, it's Swayze's Zen master/surfer/bank robber that doesn't fall into an easy stereotype and comes across as the most interesting, charismatic character in the entire movie. And you have to give the credit to Swayze and his oddly fascinating performance. There is a nice scene where he tells Utah his philosophy of surfing, \\"It's a state of mind. It's that place where you lose yourself and find yourself.\\" We find ourselves rooting not for Reeves' bland FBI agent but Swayze's thrillseeking surfer.<br /><br />Point Break is the epitome of a guilty pleasure: to dumb to defend rationally but with action sequences too cool to dismiss totally. It's a big, loud comic book of a movie and it knows it and has the conviction to go for it. But is it worth purchasing on DVD if you already own a copy?<br /><br />First up are eight deleted scenes that include more footage of Utah trying to surf. We also see him get more grief from his boss for his undercover work. There are other little bits of excised footage that doesn't really amount to all that much.<br /><br />\\"It's Make or Break\\" is a retrospective featurette. Busey, Petty and Swayze all contribute new interviews for this DVD and talk about their experiences making the movie.<br /><br />\\"Ride the Wave\\" examines the spirituality of surfing. The ocean is a double-edged sword - at once very beautiful but also very dangerous. This extra also takes a brief look at the surfer culture.<br /><br />\\"Adrenaline Junkies\\" examines the exciting stunts staged in the movie. Like his character, Swayze was into skydiving but the studio did not want him to do it. However, if you look at the first skydiving sequence, he really jumped out of the plane!<br /><br />\\"On Location: Malibu\\" is a more light-hearted extra as two of the Ex-Presidents (who were actual surfers) John Philbin and Bojesse Christopher take us on a mini-tour of key locations in Malibu used in the movie. They crack jokes and reminisce about key scenes.<br /><br />Also included are three trailers and a behind-the-scenes stills gallery.e new interviews for this DVD and talk about their experiences making the movie. <br /> <br />\\"Ride the Wave\\" examines the spirituality of surfing.

B000I0QK74|4.0|This is essentially the same release as the 2004 \\"James Taylor: A Christmas Album,\\" which was sold exclusively through Hallmark Stores and online for a limited time.  However, this one includes \\"River\\" and \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,\\" which may not have been on the Hallmark disc but WAS a bonus track on limited editions of \\"October Road\\" in 2002.  The track selection is all record company hocus-pocus.  The important thing is that this is James Taylor singin' some Christmas favorites, and if that doesn't put you in a more cheerful holiday spirit you're truly an incurable cold-blooded Grinch.  It's one of the best holiday releases I've ever heard by anyone, and I've been around since Christmas was invented, I think.  This is a can't-go-wrong purchase. Nice album cover shot, too. Nice scarf, JT.  Luv yah.
B0009P42VE|1.0|I am extremely dissappointed with amazon on this one.  This is not the dvd version of the film.  However, on all the links to it, it says \\"DVD\\".  When I received the item in the mail, amazon was very ambiguous in helping me with my return, and even told me that they would send the DVD version of the film.  Nonetheless, two days later, I received the same PSP version again.<br /><br />Great movie, it's in my top ten.  Amazon screwed up on this one.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|My first encounter with Yanni was on TV years ago when I stumbled upon his Live at the Acropolis sometime back in '98. Like most of us, I was channel surfing and stopped on PBS just when drummer Charlie Adams was doing his now-famous routine. Wow. I watched the rest of the segment and got on the phone to PBS and ordered a VHS tape (I did not have a DVD player) and just about wore out the tape from repeated viewings. <br /> <br />During one of my forays out to Vegas in '04, I happened to spot his opening night performance that was going to be held at Mandalay Bay. After much agonizing and hand wringing over the choices of Yanni,Mama Mia and going to din din at Paris, it was a no-brainer. I went to the box office and bought two seats for his show. <br /> <br />If you have never seen Yanni in performance, by all means catch a show if you ever get the chance. It might look good on VHS or DVD but in person, there is no equal. I do not know the names of all the performers but I will agree with the other reviewers in their comments. All of them did a great job that night. My favorite was Charlie Adams, the drummer, and he did not disappoint me one bit. There was a second set of drums on the stage floor that he came down to play and he opened up on his personal life which I feel added to the whole show.  <br /> <br />Of course, I have to mention the \\"girls\\"before I sign off. These are the gals that sang the Aria and other pieces during the performance. Where DO they get those voices? Truly mesmerizing. <br /> <br />The show length was over 2 hours and only 1 short break about 20 minutes after it started. Upon returning to the stage, Yanni went \\"full tilt\\" for the rest of the performance without stopping. Incredible lighting, killer sound and certainly a night that I will always remember. I saved the tickets from that night as a souvenier and I am not one to do that.. <br /> <br />Can you believe SIX curtain calls? Yanni responded to the first 5 with enthusiasm after much audience prompting, cheering, applause and whistles. He did not take the 6th as he indicated during his departure on the 5th---\\"Guys, I am tired, go to bed\\".. <br /> <br />What a night.
B000FTWB7G|2.0|It does not even come close to Fallen!!  True, Amy Lee's voice is excellent, but the band itself is lost in the background.  The music is so slow, lyrics good, but could use more fast music.  I like only three songs on this CD and I am afraid I will not play it like Fallen.  I wore out three copies of Fallen and to this day it is still one of my favorite cd's.  True, Amy Lee is beautiful and so is her voice, but what happen to the music!!!!
B000301YY8|5.0|Have had this cd since its debut and it's STILL my favorite out of ALL music I have. Was a fan from the beginning. If you are into the heart of a song, then this will satisfy on every level!
B000FFJ85I|5.0|Decemberunderground is one of the greatest cd's ever!!! I love all of AFI's music and bands do change there style to keep up to date.  Davey's style keeps the band going and his voice is great!!!  Jade's style with his guitar is his own!! Every song on this CD is excellent and you will never tire of it. Even if you have never heard of AFI, you will love this CD, give it a try!!!
B0002Y4T92|4.0|If you buy one video in the hope of learning some great guitar lick's Buy Crossroads Guitar Festival.The blues licks one can glean from watching Buddy Guy,Eric Clapton,and a great set by Joe Walsh are one of the best teaching videos i have ever seen.Slap this DVD on the player hook up your guitar and prepare to jam with the best blues players in the business.Claptons extended soloing with Doyle Bramhall JR on the songs Cocaine,I shot the Sheriff & Have You Ever Loved a Women are pure bliss to play along to.Other benifits for guitar players are the close up shots on most solo progressions and makes fingering of solos easier to learn, you will also notice the types of guitar amps and effects pedal's the players are using.<br /><br />I also agree with the other reviewers that more material should have been added, it could and should have been a 3 or 4 disc dvd set.David Hidalgo(los lobo's) and Jonny Lang & Jimmie Vaughan to name a few should have been given more time on this two disc set.<br /><br />That being said this is one of the best DVD's i have ever owned and has such great longevity, you simply will not grow tired of listening to this eclectic gathering of guitar greats.
B000H305U0|4.0|I cannot tell you how much I was impressed by this CD.  It definately is a must have for anyone who likes to bebop around in your car or working out.  Definately worth every cent.
B000088E6D|5.0|Michael Buble is simply incredible, and although I do own all of his CDs it's this one that I come back to time and time again.  This is the perfect CD to play while sipping a glass of wine or enjoying dinner with friends.  It's slow and sensual at times and then lively and fun.  I simply cannot say enough good about this artist or this CD.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Dear DVD-Producers, <br /> <br />excuse my terrible english...I'm from Germany. <br />So many people liked watching (and buying) the first series of EVERWOOD. <br />Most of them (me too) are starving to see the following seasons. <br />Why is it so hard to put the following season(s) on the market? <br />O.K., EVERWOOD isn't really the concept of todays smashing TV-Series, but look at the reviews here...no bad one. <br />Everybody who saw this fabulous show was faszinating on the warmhearted story, the nice characters and the respectful humour. <br /> <br />I don't want to put to many text here, but EVERWOOD has worldwide fangroup hoping that the rest this series will come soon. <br /> <br />In my opion all fans will pay a higher price to get this following seasons. <br />So, my dear producers, what are you saying? It is deal for you (money) and it is a deal for us (enjoying the most loveable show ever(wood))... <br /> <br />I hope you will see this review and take it under advice. <br /> <br />best regards from one really big fan <br /> <br />Wolfgang Schmidt <br />- Germany -
B000HCO840|2.0|This was a waste of money. Unless you really love fancy packaging and simply cannot live without the new comic book by Stan Lee (it's drawn like the originals), then you can go ahead and get this.    Most of the deleted scenes will leave you scratching your head. There were a couple that I just don't know how they didn't make the cut. The rest are simply fillers, and I actually felt the money being stolen from me as I was watching them.     THE ALTERNATE ENDINGS ARE NOT ENDINGS. They are post credit endings, that would replace or go along with the original. They last just as long. When I heard that this had THREE alternate endings, I couldn't wait to buy it. Man was I dissapointed.    I love the movie, but this is just about the most well produced and presented [..] I have seen. Get the regular version, you're not missing anything with this.
0312954468|5.0|River God is an epic story.  By the time you are finished you mourn for the loss of these characters in your life.  I am an avid reader so the length is only a positive for me.  I would recommend reading the Seventh Scroll as well.  I have read thousands of books in every genre, and I have to say this one is one of the best, if not the best, book I have ever read.
B000H305U0|5.0|This is probably the third greatest CD in the history of the world, behind Hasselhoff(just put them all under one title because they are all unreal) and Centerfield by John Fogerty. JT is just off tha hook with dance jams that make me breakdance like I won't get dinner if I don't slap the room around with a moonwalk. He also slows it down so you can come in high and tight with your sweet muffin. Squeeze the muffin turbo! I'm a great dancer, I know that is assumed, but this CD takes me to another level not seen since Boogaloo Shrimp tore the wall off the place in Breakin 2, electric boogaloo. I walked into my favorite club the other night, Frankendance, and \\"Sexyback\\" was playing on the system. I took off my sequin robe and it was Mcbowlerpimp cold lampin. I was doing moves that no one had ever seen or smelled before. I moonwalked in a rhombus pattern!! There was no name for that so we called it chunderwinkles. I was on fire, so they sprayed me down with an extinguisher and I kept going. I was getting women's numbers in the middle of dance moves. I know, you can't pull that off. Jabs had to grab a pen and paper because I couldn't keep up with all of the offers of love for the evening. I can take the game to levels not seen since Ricky Schroeder on Silver Spoons. I tell you this story to lay out my only complaint about this CD. JT didn't bring the \\"sexy\\" back. I ran a newspaper ad in July of 2003 declaring that I had decided to bring the sexy back. I was laying low for awhile and locked the sexy in a treasure chest like a pirate would have. I didn't think the world was ready for sexy with everything going on in the middle east. In July of 03, I figured I would take the sexy out of the box and bring it back. I brought it back at 10 lies in 03. It was front page news in the Syracuse paper the next day. Sexy was back. I'm OK with JT taking it worldwide, but I thought I would let everyone know what's up. Average and me were close when I was 4, but I moved 3 time zones from it the next year and haven't looked back.
6305535264|2.0|Firstly I am the a great Farrah fan...and am trying to complete my collection of ALL her work. So that is the only reason for purchasing this drivel. What a dissapointment this is... filmed at the height of the Sci Fi craze; Star Wars, Alien which it resembles at times but without the tension and fear...the story is slow and pedantic. The premise is not bad (two scientists working on a remote planet to save the world's food shortage peaceful existance is shattered by the arrival of a killer and his pyschotic robot) but there is no build up or character development at all. Harvey Keitel and Kirk Douglas are capable actors but one wouldnt say so from this drivel (Keitels voice is dubbed to add insult to injury) and Farrah...well...there is no hint here of the excellent character actress she would later become...but to be fair maybe she was only as good as the material she was given.
B000GG4XJM|4.0|We had to run a bunch of family errands on Saturday with Springsteen's Seeger Sessions in the car. The kids loved it. I guess I've raised them right as they recognized most of the songs. There are no bad versions of Erie Canal to the ears of my back seat.<br /><br />Also good, [...]daughter sang along with Bring `Em Home. Then, lacking a catchy slogan in the next track, made up her own lyrics about a \\"pretty princess.\\"<br /><br />Myself, I found the Boss' vocals often a bit affected for such simple material, his basic rock shout would have worked fine. Great band, though.
B00000ICN5|5.0|This is one of the finest blues albums to be produced in the past 25 years.  Right off the bat from the blistering 'Testify' to the classic 'Mary Had a Little Lamb' to the closing jazz influenced 'Lenny' you know this album is going to be something special.  SRV & TD are found here as a trio and you would be hard pressed to find a tighter band.  This album is a little more striped down and more bluesy then SRV latter works.  This and 'In Sessions' with Albert King are probably Stevie's best blues albums.
B000I0QK74|5.0|If you adore James Taylor then this is a must-have. His voice is velvet,his humor with Natalie Cole is adorable.In this world of negativity give yourself a break... pop this in,crank up the gas fireplace,sit back and find a small moment of joy.\\"Who Comes This Night\\" is an extremely good listen...the background singers evoke fond memories of days gone by...the strings uplift you.\\"Auld Lang Syne\\" will have you pining for friends that you almost forgot.If you normally find Christmas albums untimely and boring, this album is definitely worth a listen.
B000I0QK74|5.0|There's alot of people you like their regular music, but they come out with a christmas album and its just not up to par. Hardly the case with James Taylor- he never ceases to make wonderful music and take old songs and put his twist to it. This is one of the few Christmas albums that I love that is only by one person- it has such a mellow, stay at home with the family and fire type sound to it. You won't be disappointed!

B000EWBNMS|4.0|This is the only show I currently watch on tv.  I don't find anything else really worth watching and I'm glad to own this on DVD.  While it is a quality DVD release, what I find disappointing is that Arquette and Weber did not give any commentaries on the discs.  While some behind the scenes crew did, including the creator of the series, it would have been really nice to hear Arquette and Weber comment on some episodes.  Aside from that, it was a good DVD release.  Maybe they can get Arquette and Weber to do some commentaries on the third season DVD release.  I am currently watching the second season on DVD and as of yet, haven't come across any commentaries from them on that set either.
0066620996|5.0|Mr. Collins' \\"Good to Great' is a must-read for anyone who still compulsively follows the conventional wisdom regarding corporate success. His ideas are presented in the sort of accessible language that makes the book a pleasurable read; at the same time, many of the ideas are quite radical with regard to new thinking about outdated management practices. Theory is substantiated by empirical data, which results in concepts that are not to be ignored. <br /> <br />Steve Anello
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|In short, this is my new favorite CD to listen to while painting, driving, writing and working on any thing at all. I am writing my next novel as I listen to this work. The music puts me in a good mood to be sure. I oft cannot help but recall scenes from the movie while I listen to this soundtrack and so I can relive the movie even when I am too busy to get a warm cup of something wonderful and put my feet up to watch it for a couple of hours. I adored the movie, even though it differed from my expectations: better in some ways, a little lacking in others (though it gets better and better with every viewing) and it has not replaced but only added to my other 5 hour BBC P&P movie miniseries. More Jane Austen is always good. The only thing lacking in this soundtrack are one or two missing songs that I loved from the movie. But then again, and after all, I cannot truly complain, for there is so much ear candy in this modern work of classic genius. This is truly a must have.
B00004WLXZ|5.0|Before her death in 2003 at the age of 101, filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl would have you believe she had no affiliation with the Nazi party when she was asked by Adolf Hitler to document the momentous four days leading to the 1934 Nuremberg rally. However, it's obvious from her concurrently celebrated and reviled 1935 propaganda film that she was mesmerized by Hitler's oratorical skills judging from the dynamic way she has captured his undeniable charisma. She shows a remarkable deftness in editing techniques and camera movement and placement that remains the gold standard among documentarians. Riefenstahl succeeds in making Hitler a larger than life figure to the masses without resorting to editorial commentary to validate what is obvious from the images.<br /><br />The film begins with Hitler's arrival in Nuremberg by personal aircraft where he is greeted by enthusiastic throngs of Nazi supporters. In fact, the first third of the film focuses primarily on civilian support of Fuehrer and then transitions to the opening of the Reich Party Congress where we see familiar historical figures, such as Rudolf Hess and Joseph Goebbels, speak. This leads to the third day of activity with rather unsettling shots of Hitler Youth as they prepare to greet Hitler from the rows of teepees in which they have camped. Her discriminating use of close-ups is most striking here when we see tow-headed Aryan boys hypnotized by Hitler's speech. The film ends with the startlingly choreographed rally with the famous shot of Hitler, flanked by Heinrich Himmler and Viktor Lutze, walking down an emptied aisle to place a wreath at a WWI memorial (a shot replicated by George Lucas at the end of the first \\"Star Wars\\"). The climax is designed to be celebratory as Hitler leads the masses toward unity under the Reich with his fanatical delivery.<br /><br />Like D.W. Griffiths' \\"Birth of a Nation\\", it is difficult to defend the intended messaging behind such a trenchant film, yet it is criminal not to recognize the powerfully cinematic sense with which Riefenstahl imbues her work. The 2001 Synapse DVD contains a good though not outstanding print transfer. However, there are two worthwhile extras - the extremely informative commentary track from historian Dr. Anthony R. Santoro (which I recommend you switch on immediately to fully appreciate the individual personalities and historical details behind the rally) and a short Riefenstahl made at the following year's rally to celebrate the Wehrmacht (the German army), \\"Day of Freedom\\". There is little use in attempting any sort of objectivity about this film as it was intended to evoke strong emotions with the sole goal of solidifying the Reich in a country still feeling weakened from WWI. In this respect, Riefenstahl succeeds admirably.to recognize the powerfully cinematic sense with which Riefenstahl imbues her work.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|As a firm fan of the 5 hour BBC 1995 P&P miniseries, I went to this movie version with some skepticism, but found that it was much better than I expected even while it seemed to lack somewhat for me in some respects. THE P&P is hard to live up to! All in all though, I enjoyed this movie version immensely and went back to see it again right away. In and of itself, it is a delightful version of the story and even compared, it stands up on its own as another interpretation and look at the characters and events of this prima Austen work. The more I watch this movie (as a pick me up at home alone or with family or friends, with my feet up and a favorite something to nibble or sip on), the more I adore it. Let's face it; we can get our P&P fix faster/easier: in 2 hours instead of 5! (I still MUST watch the 5 hour version regularly as well.) This film version has a grittier, lowlier feel (perhaps a more realistic one) at the Bennet's and beyond, plus a more opulent contrast at Pemberly and related. One key detail that impressed me greatly was how I did not like Darcy nor see any attraction to the man at the beginning (how could HE be Darcy?!), but over time, he became more and more sympathetic (even appearing a pathetic figure at times: pitifully sunk in unrequited love - which pulled fully at my feelings to cheer him on in Elizabeth's direction) and attractive as the character - and this was as it should be. The performance of this actor made me want to see more of his work (and I have since seen him do extremely well in another role as a spoiled drunken dandy in `The Way We Live Now'.) The world needs more of this type of `old fashioned' movie.
B00003JRCQ|2.0|I love Jane Austen's works, and Persuasion, for me, comes next in line after Pride and Prejudice.  I think the story is more gentle and you really see a transformation in Anne.  The movie, however, I just didn't like.  The characters weren't portrayed well and I thought the movie was boring.  Anne in the movie had pretty much the same look on her face the whole movie which drove me nuts.  The guy who played Capt. Wentworth i thought was too angry most of the time.  I really couldn't enjoy this film because I couldn't get over the bad acting.  I'd love to see Persuasion redone with hopefully a better result.  My advice: read the book and skip the movie.
B00004W3L3|5.0|\\"Misplaced Childhood\\" is Marillion's third album, originally released in 1985. It's a concept album, and every track is special, I think.    Marillion are a neo-prog rock band, one of the 1980s groups who were really inspired by the sounds of classic progressive rock. Their sound is probably closest to \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\" era Genesis, I think. \\"Lord of the Backstage\\" on Misplaced Childhood sounds a little like a cheerier \\"Lost in NYC\\", for instance. The production though, is understandably more 1980s though. Marillion's lead singer, Fish, sounds a lot like Peter Gabriel in his angrier, charged moments, actually. It's not like the similarity comes out of impersonation, well I don't think so. Fish is definitely singing from the heart, and the tone of his voice seems to come pretty natural to him. He's Scottish, and during the spoken word parts of the album (like the start of \\"Bitter Suite\\") you can hear his accent. When he starts singing again though his accent quickly disappears. The contrast is a little weird, but it doesn't really matter.    The album is one continuous piece of music. That's not to say it's on long song. It's more like the tracks change in time with the rhythm, if that makes sense, so as one song ends, you are thrown into the next one on the next beat. While a couple of tracks (\\"Psuedo Silk Kimono\\",\\"Blind Curve\\",etc) work best in the context of the album, most of the tracks make good stand alone tunes. \\"Kayleigh\\" was actually a hit single in England, in fact, while the name Kayleigh went on to be really popular in Britain thanks to this song. I looked on Marillion's myspace site, and there are lots of girls named Kayleigh wanting to be their friend. Kind of funny.    There's a couple of themes running through this concept album. There's the breakup of Fish's longtime girlfriend and his desire to write a song for her, there's the haunting presence of a child-like figure, and the intense experience of life on the road and in the public eye. In \\"Childhood's End\\", one of my favorite tracks, Fish (or the character he portrays) realizes that all the joys of childhood are still there in his heart, and no breakup or touring is going to steal it from him if he doesn't want it to. He says to himself, regarding his ex, \\"she's got to carry on with her life/and you've got to carry on with yours\\", then with the final song \\"White Feather\\" encourages the listener, more or less, to be true to themselves. I'm not sure if this was how the concept was meant to be, but that's what I get out of it.    The booklet of the remaster's fairly good. It contains liner notes by Mark Wilkinson (who drew the cover of the album) describing the making of both the album and of the cover. There are also lyrics, and pictures of the sleeves of the singles, which go along with the themes of both the album and the cover artwork.    Overall, it's a great concept album, a great 1980s group, and a good addition to any prog rock collection. A lot of progressive rock fans, when suggesting Marillion albums to newcomers, often say \\"Script for a Jester's Tear\\", their first album. Though there's some great tunes on that album, I'd say this one would be a little better to start with. It was for me, for quite a few reasons. Every track is quality, the lyrics are particularly thoughtful, and it contains Marillion's biggest hit. Definitely worth a listen. Recommended.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Firstly, please disregard the Amazon review of this holiday CD. For Sarah McLachlan fans... this is the CD we have been waiting for since we first heard her angelic voice in the 80s. Sarah has given some of our favorite holiday songs a unique twist that brings me back to those first intimate concerts where Sarah, a piano, a guitar, back up, and 30 to 40 fans made for a magical night of Solace. The duet between the piano and the etheral voice of Sarah on \\"Wintersong\\" and the patent Mclachlan style reminiscent of Fumbling Towards Ecstacy on \\"In The Bleak Mid-Winter\\" are reason enough to buy this CD. In \\"River\\" we once again see how Sarah's appreciation for Joni Mitchell and her writing shine in her rendition of this beautiful holiday track. \\"Silent Night\\" is pure light and reminds me of her early work on the Touch album. Amazing! So... for all of us who have played \\"Song For A Winter's Night\\" over and over again during the holiday season and longed for more... here it is. Thank you Sarah. Thank you.

076790592X|5.0|This book was definitely one of those works where you can identify with what they are going through, yet you still have something to learn. I am a cargiver for a lady who has a disease almost identical to that of ALS (Lou Gehrigs) and the symptoms he describes in this book are ones that I am facing everyday I work with her.  <br />This book also brought back the feelings of when my grandfather passed away of cancer a few years ago. The things I wanted to tell him and also the things I wished he could have told me were unimaginable.  <br />All in all, I am carefully still going through this book, outlining all of the passages I want to remember.
0385720920|3.0|Certain books are page-turners which have stories that lead you into emotional states that give you a visceral release, but that doesn't describe this book.  In spite of frequent lewdness of the subject matter, this book is more about a description of a philosophy than it is about the actual characters portrayed.  The situations described in the book are there to serve the components of that philosphy (Life is less about living then finding something to do while waiting to die...), not a story-line, which is my view on why they often seem a bit stretched (ie. Dr. Paige Marshall demanding sex from Victor in exchange for her curing his Mother). <br /> <br />That said, I found this book to be very interesting and humorous because of it's dark insights.  The type of irreverant observations and flash-back style of story-telling reminded me of Kurt Vonnegut's writing in many instances.  However, I found myself often stopping after a few chapters because the negativity in this book becomes a bit overwhelming after awhile.   <br /> <br />If you don't prefer to read all about the weakness and inneffectiveness of humanity, you would do well to stay away from this one.  To me it represents a viewpoint, nothing more. <br />
0064471047|4.0|The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis was a great children's book. The adventures of Lucy, Edmond, Susan and Peter started when they had to move to their grandfather's house due to a war going in London. As they were playing a game of hide and seek they stumbled upon the magical world of Narnia. There they joined forces with the great leader Aslan and together overthrew the evil white witch. I have read this book as a younger kid and just now and there was a big difference in the way I read it. As a kid it was a lot more magical and I couldn't put it down I just had to read it. Now it might be the fact that this is the second time I have read this but it wasn't as good this time around. I had more wonder in my eyes I guess as a kid. I would recommend this book to everyone but I do truly believe kids will enjoy this book more than adults.
B00001OH7X|5.0|It's hard to pinpoint which of Bowie's albums deserves the title \\"greatest\\"...there was a period from 1970 to 1980 where pretty much everything he released was an instant classic.  From the timespan between \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\" and \\"Scary Monsters\\", the man could do no wrong. <br /> <br />\\"Lodger\\", the last piece in Bowie's Berlin Triology(following \\"Low\\" and \\"Heroes\\")is probably Bowie's most overlooked album, which is a shame as it's one of his best.  Beautiful compositions such as \\"African Nightflight\\" and \\"Move On\\" easily stand alongside the more sonically groundbreaking tracks of \\"Low\\" and \\"Heroes\\", while more straightfoward numbers such as hits \\"D.J.\\" and \\"Boys Keep Swinging\\" lend a pop aspect to \\"Lodger\\" that the previous Berlin trilogy albums lacked at times.  Just as it is more accessible than the previous Berlin albums, it is also much darker in its subject matter(Just take a glance at the cover art, where Bowie appears to be lying dead/incapacitated on the sterile floor of a morgue). <br /> <br />Another plus: \\"Lodger\\" lacks the meandering instrumentals that, in my opinion, weighed down \\"Low\\" and \\"Heroes\\" at times.  It's not that those instrumentals were bad...just that they sound REALLY dated nowadays, and distracted from the otherwise solid cohesiveness of those two albums.  \\"Lodger\\" wisely skips out on the instrumentals in order to make room for another batch of great songs. <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  Just as arty as \\"Low\\" and \\"Heroes\\", but with more pop appeal relevant to more casual fans.  Probably a good starting point for those wanting to get into Bowie's music.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|This is my first true exposure to The Muse and I have to say I am just blown away by their sound.  I just love the vocals and the way that the cd just naturally flows from one song the other.  If you are a fan of British alternative music then I would highly recommend this cd.
B00001OH7N|5.0|This is the album where Bowie first hit his stride.  After a forgettable and debut and the well-intentioned but lackluster(except for the title track) \\"Space Oddity\\" album, Bowie roared back with \\"The Man Who Sold The World\\". <br /> <br />After the folky, mod-ish wankery employed on his first two albums, Bowie hit hard with what is easily his heaviest and most challenging album.  This album is pretty much straightfoward heavy metal by the standards of 1971, at times sounding more like Black Sabbath than the man who belted out \\"Space Oddity\\" two years prior.  In fact, considering the small market for metal at the time, this album could very well have served as a strong influence for a number of bands who would define the genre more percisely during the coming years.  The guitars are heavy (Mick Ronson destroys on this album)while Bowie sticks mostly to acoustic guitar for ambience (although they are so quiet at times, the album probably would have not suffered without them).  The drums are killer, and the bass (played by the album's producer, Tony Visconti) is competent.  In fact, the backing band is rumored to be responsible for composing most of the music on this album, leaving the lyrics to Bowie. <br /> <br />The greatness of this album lies in its individual songs, however.  \\"Width of a Circle\\" is a standout, as is \\"All the Madmen\\", \\"Saviour Machine\\", \\"She Shook Me Cold\\", and pretty much every other song on the album.  The title track was famously covered by Nirvana on their \\"Unplugged\\" set years ago...they did the song more than justice, but I still perfer the original found here.  The lyrics are awesome, and set the precedent for what would be covered by Bowie's later Ziggy Stardust and Thin White Duke personas, with lots of references to Nietchze, Crowely, and supermen. <br /> <br />Keyboards and synthesizers add positively sinister tones to a number of tracks, employed to greatest effect on \\"She Shook Me Cold\\" and \\"Saviour Machine\\".  Surpirisingly, synths and keys are featured very prominitely on this album, a heavy metal album from 1971! (Bowies was several years ahead of his time, here). <br /> <br />A classic album, and the first taste of how awesome Bowie had the potentiol to be.  He would spend the rest of the decade cranking out genious albums at an astounding, inhuman pace. <br /> <br />Bowie would never be this heavy again until 'Tin Machine\\" in '89 (which sucked, incidentally).  So, if you want to hear Bowie rocking out at the peak of his abilities, this is pretty much the only place to get it.
055358202X|5.0|*********DO NOT LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS.************************ <br /> <br />After reading the reviews, I actually dreaded reading this book and put it off until now thinking it would be another Jordan book. (I preordered this from amazon back in october). But in reality, this was actually a very good book. I do not understand how the first reviewer gave this book two stars. This *is probably the weakest of the four so far, but by no means is it bad. It's still Martin writing here. I would give this book maybe 3.8 stars compared to the others. But I would also definitely give this book 5 stars relative to all others. I mean it still does not fail to blow away the competition like Hobbs and almost all others. <br /> <br />Many people complained that some of the points of view were superfluous but I have to disagree. Each and every character played a part and advanced the story, except for maybe Brienne's view. Yes, some of Cersei's chapters were fairly tedious especially near the beginning, but they improve later on. Brienne's chapters were also not terrible if you like her character like I do. Of all the views, I'd say Arya's were the most tedious to read since she's practically part of a cult the entire book and it's kinda preachy. But not bad. Martin must've been drunk when he wrote about Aerys Oakheart. The prologue was fairly boring also, but there's a rather intersting twist in the end that corresponds to it. And yes, Martin did write a 'half a hundred' a half a hundred times but it didn't really bother me. Jaime's chapters were exciting as usual. Samwell grows on you. All in all, none of the chapters were blatant filler like some people claim to be. <br /> <br />All in all, I was shocked at how the book abruptly ended especially since i thought the book was 750 pages long. It's actualy ownly about 689 pages with the rest being appendices. All in all, it did end in several cliff hangers and I am EAGERLY awaiting the next book. <br /> <br />I read A LOT of sci fi, including hobbs, cornwell, herbert, Dragonlance, Eddings etc and I'd still rank this among the best books i've read. It's not nearly as fast paced as Swords but it's not by any means a bad read. I think people were just angry that the 'main' characters were ommitted. But it's inevitable that new characters have to introduced since they are killed off so often. <br /> <br />I actually feel ashamed now that I thought Martin would be another Jordan. Keep up the good work. Dance should be a blast! I can't wait. My expectations are renewed.
020161622X|5.0|Andrew Hunt and Dave Thomas present what are humbly referred to as `tips' towards better software development. In principal, these two guys present a well put together argument that software development is a craft meant to be honed by craftsman (thus the secondary title, `from journeyman to master'). Truly, these two understand what it is to be an egoless developer destined for greatness and have captured the essence in a concise set of rules to follow. <br /> <br />Most notably is the DRY axiom (don't repeat yourself) which, although simple, encompasses so much that is bad in software projects on many levels that it leads the book off as a key tip (and is referenced further in as well). Others including understanding orthogonal code and ubiquitous automation are equally as pivotal. These authors clearly understand their terrain and think the way you want your developers to think. <br /> <br />On rare occasion, one of the tips provided seemed oddly out of the realm of what I would consider \\"key, generally applicable advice.\\" An example was the blackboard or clue bag concept seemed a little off base for a book on programming and didn't provide me with enough concrete strings back to the rest of the tips to make me understand why it was included. <br /> <br />The book includes helpful cross-references allow similar subjects to be quickly found when there is topic crossover (happens a lot). The pull out in the back with the tips quickly provided for reference re-enforce how simple it really is and reminds one that we can all improve. Also, there are lots of references to other good material as a launching point for anyone choosing to make software development their profession. <br /> <br />Overall, a must-have book for the professional developer regardless of domain or technology. Ranks up there with `The Mythical Man Month' and `Code Complete' as a classic. <br />

B000HA4WT8|4.0|The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift is about a 17 year old kid named Sean played by Lucas Black. Sean loves cars and he loves to race them but it's too bad he can't get away from the police like Brian O'conner (Paul Walker) because he's already been caught twice and is on his way to a third strike. Sean ends up wrecking his car in a race against a high school jock who was racing to keep his girlfriend. Sean gets caught and instead of going to jail he goes to Tokyo to live with his father.<br /><br />What you have here in Tokyo Drift is a new beginning for The Fast and The Furious series. Vin Diesel is no Oscar winning actor but he made The Fast and the Furious good, you can't lie and say it doesn't need him. Since Diesel won't come back and even with help Paul Walker can't give the film what it needs why not change everything but still keep the idea of being Fast and Furious. The film seems to be trying to start something new just like the original film being the first of its kind. The only material I've been able to view Japanese drifting is in the anime Initial D and this film. Both show different views on the style of the people who drift in Japan. One similar thing is that everybody's cocky and sure of their skills and everyone lives and breathes drifting. I have to tell the truth because I truly think this film is up there with the first one, I'm not saying it's better but this nicely done and has an original story just like the first film.<br /><br />Although the cast may sound weak I had a little faith in Lucas Black and little faith in Bow Wow. Bow Wow is actually a talented actor and does a nice job supporting Lucas. One thing I hated was that the writers just had to add the hot girl that is in the middle of two guys. She has to choose between the guy she is supposed to love because his family saved her life and the new guy she's supposed to hate because he's an American. You think that people would get tired of that stuff by now, when will someone surprise me with something different. In the first Fast and the Furious it was Brian chasing Toretto's sister, in the second Brian was chasing Monica (Eva Mendes), and now you have Sean who's chasing Neela.<br /><br />I have plenty of positive things to say about this film. I really liked this story even though it was getting too close to being another one of those teen movies. I love the drifting and the way it was filmed; I had doubts about the whole drifting idea. I thought drifting would be fun to do but boring to watch and I was wrong because it was hot. The slowed down scenes to show just how close these cars come to hitting the wall and spinning out of control is amazing. What I loved most about this third film is that there is a perfect blend of action throughout the film. There's not too much talking and not enough action or too much action and not enough of a story. The city was beautiful, lots of lights, cool buildings, and plenty of color. The characters are all written well and actually have deep stories. There's not as much NOS used and not as much speed as the first two movies but this movie is still very exciting. I don't think I can stress enough on how great the drifting is and how beautiful the cars are. Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift is entertaining and hopefully there will be more from the series like this one.urprise me with something different.

B000GYI32M|2.0|The only reaosn this show gets more than one star is because at the very least you can see that money is spent on it. the presentation is solid.  however,  if i wanted to watch (let alone buy) a series which is centered around a bunch of wanking rich kids i would walk around at the highschool i graduated from 7 years ago.  its all the same uninteresting [...] that people escape come graduation time senior year.  ive listened to scattered episodes from several seasons as background noise after whatever i was watching before it, but the show itself is aweful.  like i said, a bunch of rich kids with nothing to gripe about, griping about nothing. bottom line: [...] happens. you either get passed it, or you dont.  maybe my take on it is skewed by living (born and raised) in santa barbara CA which is about 2 hours north of the (real) OC, but is riddled with the same kinds of rich-kid problems.  i would rather kill my time watching grass grow than sit down and actually watch this kind of dribble.  do yourself a favor: read a book rather than buying the DVDs of the OC

B00005JPAM|5.0|F. Scott Fitzgerald famously wrote, \\"Let me tell you about the rich. They are different from you and I.\\" For the House of Windsor, that difference is magnified a hundredfold. Trained fastidiously to be the living representatives of a thousand years of British history, cocooned from everyday life by their station and privilege, the members of the Royal Family adopted a becoming public dignity and reserve that served them well in the dark days of the London Blitz. Unfortunately, that reserve doesn't play so well in the democratized Britain of the Information Age, which makes them appear cold and unlikable while simultaneously blowing the cover off the times when they, shall we say, strain against the bonds of royal protocol.  Stephen Frears' \\"The Queen\\" masterfully depicts the event that finally brought home to the Royal Family the power of the media and the people--the tragic death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in the late summer of 1997. Remembering Diana as a selfish, neurotic troublemaker, Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren), Prince Philip (James Cromwell) and the Queen Mother (Sylvia Syms) have no conception of how beloved she was by the people, simply because she possessed the common touch the rest of them so conspicuously lack. Ensconced in luxurious isolation at Balmoral Castle, they maintain a starchy silence that new Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) recognizes immediately as a public relations catastrophe. Peter Morgan's superb screenplay details the frantic efforts of Blair to get the initially uncomprehending Elizabeth to reach out to her grieving subjects. While Philip and the Queen Mum pressure Elizabeth to stand her ground (Philip mocks the list of mourners at Diana's funeral as \\"a chorus line of pop stars and homosexuals\\"), Blair's anti-monarchist wife Cherie (Helen McCrory) urges him to let the Royal Family hang itself publicly as \\"a bunch of freeloading, anachronistic nutters.\\" This is one of the most involving stories of political machination ever put on film, and extraordinarily courageous in that it portrays still-living heads of state in ways that are sometimes far less than flattering (will Prince Philip dare sue?). All the performances are a resounding affirmation of the glories of British Rep (and in this I include Cromwell, the one American ringer in the cast). But the film stands or falls in its portrayal of Elizabeth, and with the wonderful, fabulous Helen Mirren playing her, it not only stands but soars. Mirren won the Best Actress Award at the Venice Film Festival for her performance, and if there's any justice she should start rehearsing her Oscar speech. Mirren is one of the great living masters in portraying deep emotion behind a dignified facade, and \\"The Queen\\" gives her an unprecedented opportunity to do just that. (Mirren's Elizabeth gives us the textbook definition of \\"noblesse oblige:\\" standing at the gates of Buckingham Palace, reading the placards that essentially accuse her of being Diana's murderer, she makes the slightest grimace of sorrow, then turns to the assembled crowd and smiles.) \\"The Queen\\" is simply one of the best films to come out of Britain in the last decade. I would love to see a double feature of this film and \\"The Madness of King George\\"--in which Mirren played Queen Charlotte, the consort of George III. The House of Windsor might rebel at such an event, but the rest of us would be in for a treat.ever put on film, and extraordinarily courageous in that it portrays still-living heads of state in ways that are sometimes far less than flattering (will Prince Philip dare sue?).

B0007OCG56|4.0|Perhaps one of the great travesties of a film like this is the failure in marketing.  James L. Brooks makes serious movies that have a few laughs.  If we zoom in on his past films, we see the heavy detail given to the characters.  Spanglish is a character piece with some very obvious themes.  It's not very funny, but it's not supposed to be.  Fans of Sandler's slapstick comedy may be a bit taken by the understated performance here.  Moreover, they might be surprised by the fact that he isn't the \\"star,\\" as previews might suggest.  Rather, this is an ensemble piece driven by Paz Vega, who plays a Mexican immigrant who works as a housekeeper for Sandler's family in the film. Vega is brilliant, but Sandler quietly steals the show in a performance that shows his range as an actor.  He's neither comedic, as he is in comedies like \\"Big Daddy\\" or \\"The Wedding Singer,\\" or terribly manic, as he was in the quirky comic-drama \\"Punch Drunk Love.\\"  Rather, his performance is understated, honest, and very precise, as a hard-working father trying to find peace within his family. <br /> <br />The film's success relies heavily on how the characters play off each other, especially to Vega, whose entrance into the lives of everyone around her affect them and her.  It is about the communication or lack thereof between the characters.  Brooks brilliantly illustrates that language, in the literal sense, does not neccessarily equate with successful communication.  It's also not the only way to communicate effectively.   Brooks drives the point home in a very moving scene between Sandler and Vega and in the ending that may dissapoint some viewers.  It should at least illicit some discussion. <br /> <br />The film's only failure is only in what people may make it out to be.  It is, in contrast to what many viewers may see, not about the experience of Mexican in a foreign society.  While there are scenes that illustrate the displacement of cultures, the film is more interested in the idea that culture is important in terms of honesty and showing who you truly are.  Some have criticized this film as white washing the Mexican American experience, and while the film is not an ideal illustration, that's not what it intends to be.  These aspects merely serve as a springboard for a film that has much  bigger ideas that speak to a much broader audience, whatever langauge they speak.  <br /> <br />
B00004XMV6|5.0|For the longest time, I've steered clear from this movie because I once overheard my mother say to her friend,<br /><br />\\"Oh my God, I had to walk out in the middle of this filthy movie because it had no respect for food...\\"<br /><br />That was sometime in 1987.<br /><br />A few years ago, I thought I'd be rebellious and watch the movie anyway.<br /><br />Hell, my mom didn't have to know.<br /><br />Plus I was definately old enough...<br /><br />On the contrary to my initially biased impression, this movie, for some reason wasn't as blatantly \\"filthy\\" to me as how my mother described.  Rather, it was an interesting story about a woman captivated in a torturous love affair that was ever so consuming - and how she managed to free herself from an addiction to a numb lover who was equivalent to a cruel child.<br /><br />In other words, I really liked it. :)<br /><br />And for the record - I still have no problems eating strawberries.<br /><br />Then again, who with 20/20 vision can say \\"No\\" to pre-surgery Mickey Rourke??
B000HCO83Q|3.0|I am reviewing this movie not from a purely film critic's point of view, nor am I a rabid X-Men comic book fan. No, I am more of a longtime fan of the 1990s Fox Channel cartoon series. With that bias-ness in mind, I have to say, even in animated form, this movie still wouldn't work.    Having followed the cartoon series for more than four years, it more or less covered the popular themes of the comics such as the creation of Sentinels, each X-Men's roots of origins, the Savage Lands, the Phoneix/Dark Phoneix saga. Whatever Bryan Singer had built up as a momentum for the 1st two movies, Brett Ratner prematurely \\"[...]\\" it all in this movie. I know that Ratner was brought in as a last minute replacement, and the core of the problems lies with the script and the Fox executives behind it.    Seeing that all franchises should end as a trilogy (Star Wars, Indiana Jones), in all their infinite wisdom, the Fox executives decided to throw every possible thing they got in this final movie in the franchise, thus \\"The Last Stand\\". Too much cooks doth spoil the broth, as the saying goes. Let's take a closer look at the casting:  1. Halle Berry looks better here, I admit. But does she have to be the central character now? Let's face it, she can't act here.    2. Kelsey Grammer as The Beast. Wonderful casting choice. Unfortunately, he participated in just one battle. We need more \\"beast\\" moves and fight scenes here!    3. Alan Cumming not returning as the cheeky German Nightcrawler? Uh-oh...not a good sign.    Even though I am not the final authority on the X-Men comic universe, but I can safely vouch for the fact that the Dark Phoneix subplot was treated with an utter sense of contempt and disrespect. The Dark Phoneix saga should provide the backdrop for an entire X-Men movie! The pacing is so uneven, as if Ratner couldn't wait to get to the action sequences. Talk about ADD! He's worst than a high school kid on speed. He should be injected with Ritalin.     With a reported budgetof US$210 million dollars, I don't see where the money had gone to. The subtitle of the movie states it is \\"The Last Stand\\". The last battle at the end was alleged to be an all-out war as advertised and stated by the characters in the movie. To me, it's just a mere skirmish. An all out X-Men war would involve Magneto, X-Men combined with Cable, Bishop, etc. against Apocalypse in a futuristic setting. Now, that's really \\"The Last Stand\\"!     I'm sorry, Fox executives. If you are going to piss that sort of money on a hack like Ratner, while curbing Singer's creativity and balking at his lower than original budget, you have lost a creative pool of talent and a franchise at the same time.    Oh yes, I forgot to mention that this movie should be known as The Wolverine and Storm Show.    P.S. Angel was never in an X-Men uniform in the movie at all. Never. I nearly died laughing when I saw the cover of the DVD.
B00006878K|5.0|A lot of Albert King's stuff has been turned into dull blues-rock cliches, but you can't blame him for that.  This album is an incredibly satisfying experience.  The songs are all well-written and arranged perfectly.  Albert King may not have been the most versatile guitarist, but his playing always sounds good and he knew what to play and when to play it.  Crosscut Saw and Personal Manager have two of the greatest guitar solos I've ever heard (I also like Albert's habit of saying things like \\"Watch this\\", \\"heads up\\", and \\"Woo!\\" during his solos).  The Hunter is catchy like the flu.  I Almost Lost My Mind is one of the prettiest blues songs you'll ever hear.  If you like blues you will love this album.
0515141429|1.0|Short sentences.  Incomplete.  He likes them.  Loves them, really.  Six word limit.  Good for some folks.  Not for me.  No short attention span here.  How about you?  I shrugged.  Why did I finish it?  Dunno.  I shrugged.<br /><br />If that type of writing appeals to you, then this is the book for you.  It drove me crazy.  The main character, Jack Reacher is really not very likeable.  The plot is predictable and not very interesting.  It just plods along in short, incomplete sentences with everybody shrugging.  Blah!
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I am from Scotland, and this show is a great change to all the rubbish we get over here. It's is so down to earth and realistic, without being boring. The characters are so very well developed and real - not a single one of them is false or pointless - they are all a part of the story. I started watching this show when it was halfway through the 2nd season on ITV and just had to buy season 1. Then when I went back to college, I couldnt watch it anymore. I miss it so much, and really want to know everything that happened! I need this to come out on DVD or I will never get the chance to see it - please can this show's seasons 2-4 be released on DVD?????

0802130208|4.0|I am sad to admit that I'd never heard of this book until I was loaned it by a roommate, but fortunately it was well worth the wait and one of the best literary surprises I've read recently. The main character, Ignatius J. Reilly, is a larger than life, disheveled and slightly deranged man who haunts the French Quarter of New Orleans and the rest of the cast, each an absurd caricature in their own right, mingles with each other in very funny and unexpected ways.  <br /> <br />While the characters and their hijinx certainly propel the story along, just as imporant as the people who inhabit New Orleans is the city itself, with its quirks and originality on full display. It is a wonderful and loving reminder of the pre-Katrina hedonistic, lively New Orleans, but at same time the author does not hide the racism, segregation and other problems from which they city also suffered. This was one best depictions of a place I've ever read.  <br /> <br />Finally, the author also does a brilliant job of pacing the story and bringing everything in it full circle, just as Ignatius had been predicting all along in his discussions of Fortuna. It was a very clever trick that can not fully be described, in a short review, but alone makes this story worth reading. <br /> <br />A Confederacy of Dunces is a fantastic, lively, and hilarious book which is loose and frenzied, but it is written with fantastic structure. I would highly recommend it for people who like a good laugh, New Orleans or enjoyable fiction, but also people who enjoy reading books through an academic lens. It is very well crafted, but also a lot of fun.
B0000VAFNQ|4.0|In this thriller, Vampires are at war with the Lycans {werewolves}, who were kept as slaves until in a very Romeo and Julet scenario, Elder Vampire \\"Viktor\\" slays his own daughter in front of her werewolf lover who goes on to wage a battle to avenge her death.  Here, The Vampires are aristocratic libertines presiding in opulent lairs while the Lycans are more or less street thugs residing under the city.<br /><br />Subsequently, the Lycans formulate a plan to mix vampire and werewolf DNA to create a master warrior who would destroy the vampires once and for all. Lucian, the leader of the Lycans, sets his sights on a mortal named 'Michael' to be transformed into this champion for them. It is seen that this warrior represents the \\"son\\" \\"Lucian\\" never had, who himself falls in love with 'Selene', an attractive lycan-hunter, which stirs contention with Kraven, lord of the Vampire castle who stands as vampire ruler, whose reign is less than acceptable to Emperor Viktor, once he is awakened by Selene and becomes aware of the potentially dangerous situation brewing with the Lycans, which can effectively end their existence.<br /><br />Armed with silver nitrate bullets, Selene and a handful of vampires go forth to decimate these werewolves, before they reach them and tear them to pieces. One of the more gorey scenes involves a massacre within a train.<br /><br />Confused by the changes he is experiencing and impelled by his growing fascination with this shadowy underworld as well as an infatuation for Selene, Michael returns to the castle where he was kept prisoner after being kidnapped by Selene, and eventually is captured by Lucian, wherein his resident geneticist \\"Singe\\" begins experimenting to complete the matamorphosis into the Vampire-Werewolf synthesis.<br /><br />Viktor wages elegantly with the furious amalgamated warrior, and in an unexpected twist, Selene goes sword to sword with Viktor, ending with a most interesting strike.<br /><br />The film is repleat with enjoyable dark environments, leather-clad accoutrement, impressive transmogrifications, an original and compelling plot, with constant action-adventure {not horror}, in a general \\"Buffy\\"/VanHelsing-like vain, although the premise is superior to those presentations. Feral monsters versus regal creatures, preserving the story within the shadows, devoid of any pretentiously daylighty \\"heroic\\" characters, which is appreciated.clad accoutrement, impressive transmogrifications, an original and compelling plot, with constant action-adventure {not horror}, in a general \\"Buffy\\"/VanHelsing-like vain, although the premise is superior to those presentations.

B000001DYA|5.0|My friend recommended this album to me about three years back. I wasn't totally oblivious of this group, I had heard of \\"Summertime Blues\\" but then again, even my grandma has heard of that one. So I got the CD in prompt fashion (thanks, amazon) and put it in the 'ol player...\\"What the $#@&*?\\"<br /><br />Was my friend serious?<br /><br />This group sounded muddy, warbled, and totally off their nut. But my friend insisted, \\"You gotta listen to them like you're there with them, man...\\"<br /><br />\\"Okay, dude, you're almost 40...stop drinkin' the frickin' bong water...\\"<br /><br />But I did and I'm glad that I didn't make this CD a $15.00 coaster. They're loud, crude, fuzzy, and a total delight. Maybe I was the one that was drinking the tainted H20 because this album really kicks.<br /><br />My personal favorite songs on this album are:<br /><br />1) Out of Focus<br /><br />2) Second Time Around<br /><br />3) Summertime Blues<br /><br />I decided to put this CD in my wife's CD alarm clock. At 5:45 AM, Blue Cheer just wailed us both out of bed. All my wife could say was, \\"What the $#@&*?\\"<br /><br />Yeah, man...it's that good.
B0000AFX64|1.0|this is the cut down version of the 3 hour pilot that universel released in theaters after the show went belly up in '78. if you buy the whole series you can skip this pointless rehash that isn't that good or very well thought out.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis Presley died too young; but his music and his gift to us will live forever. This CD boasts a whopping 30 number one hits recorded by Elvis. This is not merely an introduction to Elvis or a standard retrospective of his work; this CD is also a celebration of Elvis' talent and the wonder of Elvis sharing his artistry with all of us.<br /><br />The CD starts off with the classic \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" and moves into \\"Don't Be Cruel.\\" These songs offer great musical arrangements and the sound quality is excellent. The Jordanaires are backup vocalists on \\"Don't Be Cruel.\\" The Jordanaires back up Elvis on other famous songs on this CD including \\"All Shook Up;\\" \\"(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear;\\" \\"It's Now Or Never;\\" and \\"Return To Sender.\\" These songs are very popular to this day because they address universal issues of passion, desire and heartache.<br /><br />Other great songs on this CD include \\"(Now And Then There's) A Fool Such As I;\\" \\"Hound Dog;\\" \\"Jailhouse Rock;\\" \\"Suspicious Minds\\" and \\"Burning Love.\\" Indeed, there isn't a single loser in the bunch on THIS album; these are all number one hits that prove Elvis was \\"The King\\" of rock and roll.<br /><br />The songs are also presented in chronological order so you can understand how Elvis' music and talents evolved over time--a nice plus!<br /><br />The liner notes are wonderful. Peter Guralnick contributes a fine essay about Elvis' career; and there is a short story about the history of each song on this CD. Ernst Mikael Jorgensen presents another insightful essay as well about the making of the CD. You get the release date and the recording date for each song; and the song credits exist as well. There's even a section describing Elvis merchandise for sale--very extensive!<br /><br />There's the bonus track entitled \\"A Little Less Conversation\\" recorded originally by Elvis in 1968 and presented here in a dance mix format. The newer dance music mix version of this song is different from the rest of Elvis' work on this CD so this bonus track will be something you will either like or not like. You can listen to the Amazon sound clip if you wish.<br /><br />Overall, this CD of huge number one hits by Elvis Presley proves that Elvis was--and is--the king of rock and roll. Nobody could touch an audience quite the way Elvis could. When Elvis said \\"I don't sound like nobody\\" to someone at the Sun recording studio all those years ago he really meant it. There will never be another Elvis; and we were extremely fortunate to have him entertain us with his singularly beautiful music. If you like this CD I recommend other Elvis CDs including ELVIS 2ND TO NONE and The 50 Greatest Love Songs. Thank you for everything, Elvis! We will always remember you fondly!on this CD so this bonus track will be something you will either like or not like.

B0002V7ODI|4.0|Let's be blunt, the movie is, in essence, a little lumbering and flawed and has a rather odd climax. The beginning is overlong and vaguely too fantastical, but once you realize this is a very different world, a comic book really, and normal rules don't apply, it can be forgiven. In fact most of the flaws can be forgiven because of Ron Perlman and what he brought to the picture.<br /><br />This is one of few movies I've ever gone to see on the opening weekend, possibly the only one. And I did so because I was already a fan of Ron Perlman and it was great to see him in a leading role, even though he's covered in makeup. Perlman is the best thing in this movie; he is perfect as Hellboy. He swaggers through it as if he'd always been a leading man. Delivering one-liners with ease and to perfection, battling monsters through subterranean sets and city streets, and giving a great comedic performance as well as a very emotional one that makes you just love the big red oaf. A great feat considering the extensive makeup he had to act through.<br /><br />And the makeup and prosthetics are the best of its kind I've ever seen. There's movement and expression in the lips at times that you would think would be impossible. You might at first think that the lips are rather stationary and unexpressive, but if you just pay attention you'll see that there is a lot of movement and subtleties to it. Rick Baker should be praised for his work in this, it's amazing.<br /><br />Doug Jones is awesome as the body of Abe Sapien. His movements are truly beautiful. And David Hyde Pierce as the voice is perfect. Abe is a very interesting and neat character that I wouldn't mind seeing more of. And his makeup is as amazing or even more so than Hellboy's.<br /><br />John Hurt is great in this, as is Jeffrey Tambor. Everyone in this does a great job. But Perlman's performance as Hellboy really holds the movie together. His character stands out and speaks to the audience better than any other.<br /><br />If you liked X-Men or Spider-Man don't expect a movie as well polished and put together, but you should be able to enjoy it and the more overt comic book feel of the movie. And unlike the aforementioned movies there is quite a bit of light humor throughout Hellboy that should garner some laughs from most anyone.<br /><br />Hellboy isn't perfect, I would have changed some things, but I had fun watching it and in the end, especially for a movie of this type, I think that's what matters most. In fact I like it more now, after seeing it again, than I did when walking out of the theater.<br /> <br />If you liked X-Men or Spider-Man don't expect a movie as well polished and put together, but you should be able to enjoy it and the more overt comic book feel of the movie.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|The music contained within this CD is simply brilliant, particularly when compared for what passes as commercial music these days.Dylan's songwriting and vocals are superb and his production efforts are flawless. The band is in top form and the mix is spot on.This project,as most of Dylan's recorded work, will stand the test of time. My only criticism is the absence of any acknowledgement for songwriting inspiration. Certainly at least a \\"tip of the hat\\"is deserved by Big Maceo Merriweather for his influence of Worried Life Blues for Someday Baby. Same goes for Hambone Willie Newbern as it relates to Rollin and Tumblin. Perhaps, we'll have to wait for the next chapter of Chronicles to acknowledge these artists.
B00008DDXC|4.0|Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is the type of movie that will be around forever. So far the two Harry Potter movies have been excellent movies in which spirit of the books by JK Rowling has been captured and expanded upon.<br /><br />Chamber of Secrets is about Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) second year in Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry and something is attacking the students. The fact that these students are of mixed parentage, one being a muggle(non-magical and the other being a witch or wizard) leads to a very unstable environment at Hogwarts.<br /><br />Directed by Chris Columbus and written by Steve Kloves this movie packed with the details that Rowling weaves throughout her book. The score by John Williams is excellent and well suited to the movie. Roger Pratt's cinematography is amazing. There is flashback to an earlier time at Hogwarts by way of a magical Diary that is brilliantly lit and shot in a sepia tone that looks just like the color of old paper.<br /><br />Kenneth Branagh gives a great performance that should have gotten more attention at award time. Jason Isaacs owns the role of the villainous Lucius Malfoy. His costuming and look are very well matched with that of Draco Malfoy, a nemesis of Harry's. Shirley Henderson as a ghost is also very good and steals her scenes. Returnees Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, and in particular the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore are very good. Christian Coulson does a good job as the mysterious Tom Riddle.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint (Ron) are very good in this movie and have their characters down. Watson in particular is excellent.<br /><br />Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets in an underrated movie that is a must see.
B000IFSDZQ|4.0|The scope of this project is almost breathtaking: This box wishes to include all the highlights of Roxette's career and at the same time include enough rarities to make it interesting for the dedicated fans (who are probably the ones who are going to turn up buying it in the end). The first question one must ask is then, does it succeed? And the answer will remain unanswered for a time yet, cause I really don't know. It's not a bad attempt, that's for sure - even decidedly better than what one could have feared for. And still, there are some inclusions, I'd muself label as forgettable, while some tracks I consider career highlights are nowhere near this box. But considering a list including 78 tracks plus a DVD featuring 23 acoustic live cuts plus a staggering 37 (!) music videos, the line has to be drawn somewhere, and no matter what the selection had been, any fan would have some favorites left out. I will go through the tracks from different era and also comment on demos and B-sides.    - PEARLS OF PASSION -    The band's first album was at best forgettable (with the exception of the undeniable Soul Deep, that would later show up on Joyride), and what's included here is, with the exception of said song, well - forgettable. I would have been perfectly happy had this album not been represented here, but well - it *is* a part of their career to be fair - it's just a sad thing that quality tracks from later albums is dragged in beside this dodgy material.    - LOOK SHARP -    The Hit Singles are here, of course - The Look, Dressed For Success, Dangerous, Listen To Your Heart. This was where it started, for real. In case you wonder, Dangerous is included in the original album version as on the Pop Hits record (I might have preferred the single mix as on the 95 Don't Bore Us compilation, but never mind that). Look Sharp was not a very good record - it had some really brilliant songs, and it had some not so brilliant songs. The reason why it became a success was that they were fairly successfull in choosing only the great songs for singles. Exception was Chances, which is blissfully omitted from this collection. Other highlights from the album was Cry - oddly included in a Demo version here, where I'd say the original version was perfectly fine (I suspect they chose the Demo to have an 'unreleased' song on this CD) - Sleeping Single and then I Could Never Give You Up, which didn't make it into this collection. Paint was never a favorite of mine, but apparantly somebody thinks different about this, since it's included (why not take the more pleasing rockier live version?), but to be fair, it's a fairly good track, and better than what remains from the CD. Also, we get the somewhat rare track The Voice, an outtake from the album, but deffinitely one of the better tracks of the era, and all in all, I think the Look Sharp era is well represented here.    - JOYRIDE -    Joyride remains one of the best pop records ever, and is represented here by a staggering 9 of it's 14 tracks (not counting Soul Deep also re-issued on that record!). And mind you, it's not one too many - actually, they could easily have included Small Talk and Physical Phasination as well. What is included, however, is a nice mix of single favorites - Joyride, Fading Like A Flower, Big L, Spending My Time - and lesser known tracks arguably of superior quality - Watercolours In The Rain, Perfect Day and (Do You Get) Excited?. A worthy testimony to a legendary album. Also included is the terrific outtake from that album, The Sweet Hello, The Sad Goodbye (that this track didn't make the album seems unbelievable).    - TOURISM -    This is perhaps where I feel the collection starts to fail slightly. Admittedly, included are a worthy share of ballads - The Heart Shaped Sea, The Rain and Never Is A Long Time are all classic tracks (albeit none of them were released as single). Silver Blue, a track that goes back to the early days of Look Sharp, is also a worthy inclusion (albeit it would sit better with the Look Sharp tracks!), and of course lead singles How Do You Do! and Queen Of Rain here. Left out, however, is the delighting Cinnamon Street - which was turned down by many fans, but imo. featured some wonderfull vocal harmonies between Per and Marie - and also the beautiful So Far Away, for me the highlight of that album. Even more strange is the omision of Fingertips - a very underrated track imo. (I prefer the original version, but the 93 version was even out as retail single), and none of the versions is included. Instead we get the dodgy Come Back (Before You Leave) that sounded dated already when it came out on the original record, and probably takes the price as worst Roxette album cut post 1991. Also, a bit dissapointingly, they didn't try to restore the FULL into to Heart Shaped Sea (which, on the original record was faded in under audience applause - bummer!) - but only included the part which had no audience on the original recording (but it has some intro, as opposed to the version on the Almost Unreal single). And speaking about Almost Unreal, that track is of course also included here.    - CRASH! BOOM! BANG! -    Another record that I feel doesn't get it's full attention here. Included are the four singles C!B!B!, Vulnerable, Run To You and Sleeping In My Car, and also a couple of none single tracks - The First Girl On The Moon and I'm Sorry. All worthy inclusions - but single track Fireworks is, again, omitted, as are the rock anthems I Like The Sound Of Crashing Guitars and Harley's And Indians (arguably not the bands best works, but very time typical). Even worse, album highlights Place Your Love, What's She Like and Go To Sleep are all left out.    - DON'T BORE US (GET TO THE CHORUS) (Greatest Hits) -    Included from this set is all four new songs, which is a treat - the rocking She Doesn't Live Here Anymore was left out from previous compilations, as was I Don't Want To Get Hurt (probably the best of the set). Ofcourse, June Afternoon and You Don't Understand Me is also here.    - HAVE A NICE DAY -    This album is one of my favorites, and I'm pleased to see this album get a great representation here - a full 11 tracks, albeit three as demos (are they better than the original? I don't think so, but be that as it may). All included tracks are worthy - the full album was in fact worthy! - but I truly miss I Was So Lucky and Crush On You, two of my favorites - especially the latter is a fan favorite, and is inexplicably left out! To have the album described as \\"not very succesfull in it's final shape\\" in the liner notes also annoys me!    - ROOM SERVICE -    And then, with this collection, the box misses the mark completely. Of course, the singles are there, but the only none-single tracks included are Jefferson - not a great track, but passable - and Little Girl, which imo is way below their usual standard. Left out are brilliant tracks like Try (Just A Little Bit Harder) (a classic love song), Fool (great rock song with lots of hit potential), Make My Head Go Pop (powerpop with even more hit potential - the greatest hit single never released?), It Takes You No Time To Get Here (great Gessle-lead ballad) and the album highlight, My World, My Love, My Life. Very dissapointing.    - BALLAD HITS AND POP HITS -    All 4 new songs from this collection is included, as well as 7 of the 8 tracks on the bonus CDs (Makin' Love To You is curiously omitted). Thus, all in all 37 of the 38 tracks spanned on those CDs are included in this set, and one cannot help wonder why they didn't include the last track. They didn't wan't to make the old set obsolete perhaps?    - B-SIDES, DEMOS, and PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED TRACKS -    This is where the set should exhel to draw in the old-time fans, and I generally think the set falls short on this point. The collection includes several B-sides, but many are left out as well - I personally miss the tracks Crazy About You and Entering Your Heart, which Ifind much better than many songs included here. One could think that it would have been reasonable to include these tracks rather than some of the tracks on the bonus CDs from the old collections - albeit admittedly, all those tracks are top class.    There are also numerous Demos on the set - many of them, however, of album tracks from the regular CDs. The band must have found the Demos better than the released versions, but in general, I disagree with this. Most of the Demos are very like the normal versions of the songs, however. There are a number of Demos of none-album tracks as well - some of them have been released as B-sides. Seduce Me, All I Ever Wanted and New World stands as the real keepers of these, and Love Spins is also a fair track (albeit it sounds as a leftover from the very early days). Curiously, the muched hyped demo of the new track Myth to me is totally bland and completely uninspiring - much better fares the outtake from Don't Bore Us, Always Breaking My Heart, which I had seen nowhere before, and which is a nice and rocking song. Also, fans will be delighted by the odd demo of Anyone merging into a completely different track called I Love How You Love Me. Very interesting.    I do miss a host of previously unreleased tracks among the demos, however.  Bad Moon (this was actually a Marie Frederiksson demo, but it should be here because it is such an amazing track), Always The Last To Know, I Do Believe and Do You Wanna Go With Me are amazing tracks, that I simply cannot believe didn't make the cut. Older tracks released as B-sides (for instance, One Is Such A Lonely Number) would also have been natural to include. I could excuse lack of completeness, if they had selected only the best material, but they have not! Much of the excluded material is much better than several things here. But also keep in mind, as I said in the beginning - one man's favorites won't match the next man's.    - THE DVD -    The DVD includes the complete MTV Unpluggedshow plus the full set of 37 Videos. The latter is not that impressive, since a DVD including 35 of these was released in 2001, and then another in 2003 including the same 37 videos - and the new video for One Wish is *not* included. The MTV show is a nice treat, however, especially since the band had to fight with MTV for the rights of the complete show, some of which has not been seen before. Roxette might not be the best live band, but this show has many nice moments - stand out moments are the covers of I Never Loved A Man (The Way I Loved You) (Marie's voice is amazing here!) and Heart Of Gold, and then in the previously unreleased bonus tracks, we get killer takes on Spending My Time, The Heart Shaped Sea, Cry, Watercolours In The Rain and Perfect Day. As a side note, it should be mentioned that the DVD is double-sided, which is a bit confusing at first (the MTV show is on one side, and the Videos on the other).    - COMPILATION ARRANGEMENT -    The songs are arranged strictly chronologically, and I'm not sure I feel this is the best way to sort things. The trick of splitting Ballads from Pop songs in the previous compilation set might have resulted in monotoneous CDs, but I think it turned out excellently - and I'm not sure I wouldn't have preferred a recollection of that approach in this set. Something like Disc 1 - Ballad Hits, Disc 2 - Pop Hits, Disc 3 - Ballad Favorites, Disc 4 - Pop Favorites, Disc 5 - Rarities and Demos, + DVD.        - ON THE BOTTOM LINE -    In spite of all my objections, I think this set does a good job of presenting the band through their career. Newcomers will deffinately be pleased by what is included, and the casual fan will find this a great introduction to fasets of the band they didn't know. The dissapointed ones will probably be the hardcore fans, that will not find as much new and rare material here as they could have hoped for. That being said, the collection probably does a good job of settling in the middle land between what would be best for all parts - the question is then, whether it's a good solution to refrain from doing what's best for some parts in order to try to please all.    OVERALL GRADE: 8.5 / 10.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like \\"The Phantom Menace,\\" I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was \\"How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?\\" rather than \\"How entertaining is this film overall?\\" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.<br /><br />Critics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps I'd have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many classic children's movies, like \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and \\"Mary Poppins,\\" are so successful partly because they're so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most children's movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they're based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children's book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That's why it's easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.<br /><br />As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don't have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It's as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, \\"Adventures in Babysitting\\"), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don't. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that's exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry's two best friends are flawless.<br /><br />I had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children's delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry's swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like \\"Home Alone\\" and \\"Mrs. Doubtfire.\\" Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors' faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely ingiving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.<br /><br />But much is left out. Harry's caretaker Uncle Vernon, a prominent character in the book, is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren't in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the following--\\"Professor McGonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffbox--points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers\\"--find no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nine-and-three-quarters, though the way the kids disappear into the wall isn't as mysterious as I had visualized, and the sorting hat is there, minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.<br /><br />Not that I'm blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen, and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary (eight hours, maybe?), like a BBC miniseries, the film might have been a masterpiece, but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.<br /><br />The problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowling's series, in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary \\"muggle\\" world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules, history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books, not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works, is a large part of their charm. Take away these details, and you're left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.<br /><br />Although the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended (something I've never seen happen before, though I don't go to the theater that often), some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didn't have that problem, but, as I said, I wasn't really trying to get involved in the movie's story. After thinking about it, it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books, and this is without a doubt the very same story.<br /><br />The answer, I think, is that the books portray much of Harry's anxiety in trying to succeed in school (for if he's kicked out, he'll go straight back to his horrible uncle) and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesn't tap into these anxieties enough, so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match (other than that he survives in one piece) and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning, which in the book is almost secondary. Harry's adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting, but as they are presented to us in the film, there isn't enough tying them all together.<br /><br />What we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children's series, but it doesn't entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little, to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the book's delights to the screen. In its current form, it's almost like a preview of the book.

0060234814|5.0|The popular children's book The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis, teaches biblical messages through a dramatic and intriguing plot. It all begins in WWII when a mother sends her four children off to the country to live with a professor for safety. The children were very curious and often spent hours playing hide and go seek, which lead to them discovering many new rooms and parts of the mansion. One day the youngest girl, Lucy, hid in a coat wardrobe. She walked to the very back of the closet where she revealed a new land. It was snowing and right away she discovered an odd creature. Lucy eventually went back through the wardrobe and tried to explain her discoveries to her brothers and sisters but none of them believed her. Finally Lucy was given the opportunity to prove her tale and her siblings peter, Edmund and Susan followed. Once they all entered the land they were told by a creature named Tumnus that the queen would want to kill them if she ever found them. This is because they were human and threatened her power. The rest of the novel is a biblical parallel to basics tenants of Christianity. The good and evil were always at war and at one point the Lion was slain. He rose from the dead and was able to overthrow evil. This is directly related to what the bible teaches. I believe this a great story. At a young age it has a fascinating plot with magical creatures and a powerful ending. At a more mature age is has vast symbolism that still allows for an easy read, without lacking in complexity. I think the characters in the new land are remotely bizarre but I enjoyed that if left me wondering about their personality because it lacks the usual stereotypes that are often placed on everyday characters. I couldn't tell whether the character was sympathetic or an antagonistic until I kept reading. Overall I highly suggest reading this book. When the final page is read it will leave you thinking. It's a quick read with deep meaning.

B000H30B2C|4.0|First, i like this movie. It's not one of the best but it was marvellous and good making. <br />For the rest, good or bad...just remember...if a director decide to make a movie it's for twoo reason :  <br />- first: it's was a contract with a studio and he make a movie for the studio ( verry calibrate ) and for the audience. <br />- second: it's for him because he has the power and the finance...and he make a movie for him, for his pleasure not for the public. <br />In every case, a movie is never made for the demand of the public. <br />For many years, Peter Jackson dream about to make this movie, it's was his vision and he was not interested about \\"what think and what hope the public\\".
B00005JPAD|4.0|After getting some uncalled for flack recently for his films \\"Gangs of New York\\" and \\"The Aviator\\" director Martin Scorsese returns to those gritty mean streets he seems to know oh so well. How odd it is then to find out that the film did not come from Scorsese's imagination. Instead it is a remake of the 2004 Hong Kong action/thriller \\"Infernal Affairs\\". But, that doesn't really matter because Scorsese takes the material and makes it his own.<br /><br /> \\"The Departed\\" is going to get some unfair comparisons with \\"Infernal Affairs\\" from devoted fans of the original. I never like to do that. I also don't like when people compare the book to the movie version. Both pieces of work exist within their own world. They are seperate from each other.<br /><br /> Leonardo DiCaprio (the recent favorite of Scorsese, whom in my opinion needs to find a new muse already) plays Billy Costigan, who comes from a poor working class family that mostly consist of family member who were on the wrong side of the law (depending which side of the law you're on). He has managed though to work his way up and become a cop.<br /><br /> Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan, who appears to be the exact opposite. Sullivan is one of those people who probably got straight \\"A's\\", stayed at home and studied while you were out playing baseball and was a loner. He too has become a police officer who is well thought of and clearly on a successful path.<br /><br /> These two characters never share a great amount of screentime together in \\"The Departed\\" but their impact on each other is apparent throughout the entire film.<br /><br /> Costigan is told by one of his superior officers Oliver Queenam (Martin Sheen) that because of his background he is not really \\"police material\\". Queenam flat out tells him you will never make it as a cop. So Queenam tells Costigan he has a special assignment for him. He wants Costigan to go undercover and get into Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) inner circle where the Boston Police have been trying to arrest him for years.<br /><br /> \\"The Departed\\" soon takes on one of Scorsese's favorite themes, childhood loyalty. Sullivan, back in his youth, became very friendly with Costello and now as a cop has turned into a crooker officer. How will the Boston police ever catch Costello?<br /><br /> The performances in \\"The Departed\\" are all pitch perfect. DiCaprio and Damon, who get top billing, are not just the only two worth watching. Even supporting characters like the ones played by Alec Baldwin and just so it's not all all boy's show, Vera Farmiga as Madolyn are both enjoyable to watch. But, perhaps the most memorable performances is the one given by Jack Nicholson. Rarely has an actor relished playing a villian moreso. The sheer exuberance of his performance makes the screen come alive. This isn't the Jack of recent films like \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" and \\"About Schmidt\\". Jack lets loose here and plays the role with the same spirit he did the Joker in \\"Batman\\". I would even go as far as saying every performance here deserves to get an Oscar nomination.<br /><br /> Some people may ask is this film as good as Scorsese's other films? That's a stupid question. Who cares? It seems, according to the reviews and box-office numbers (this marks Scorsese's highest box-office debut) people are responding well to this film. It is a powerful, well made gangster film that is about more than violence. As I said it is about loyalty and who we choose to give that loyalty to. This is one of the best films of the year! In fact the movie is so good I'm sure Scorsese will lose another Oscar race, just as his best films always do.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: One of the year's best films. \\"The Departed\\" finds Scorsese going back to the gritty mean streets of his past and makes this remake a work of his own.

B000002P2V|3.0|By 1978, The Who, and much of their musical generation, had became increasingly irrelevant as new tastes (punk and disco both featured here) and old age arrived. Except of course to the fans who refused to grow up, demanding the same songs repeatedly, listening to the dinosaur rock stations and paying big bucks to witness wealthy old men pretend to be angry 19 year olds.<br /><br />Well, before that ignominious collapse was complete, Pete and the gang produced a couple of pretty good collections of rock and roll. And this is my favorite of their post opera LPs. I have always felt Trick of the Light and Guitar and Pen were wonderful songs, among the band's best, well-written lyrics coupled with (not married to) effective music. I haven't heard them in years, and they are as good as I remember.<br /><br />So, who's reading this to decide if the purchase is worth it? If this is, by some bizarre chance, your first look at The Who, by all means, go elsewhere. They produced much that still sounds fresh and vibrant today. Someone who had the LP and is wondering if it is worth the cost to get the \\"extras\\"? Well it is fairly cheap and the extras are fine. Nothing spectacular (and having to get through not just one, but two versions of Love Is Coming Down, among the most unpleasant songs they ever recorded, is a major liability) but good enough. Someone who is looking to capture some of that spirited youthfulness? Well, as the last angry snarl fades, I'm left with a feeling of \\"this part of my life is past.\\" I've had enough. This is not great music, not great production, not great writing.
0679422714|5.0|A very engaging book, I read it daily until I finished it.  Though it was a biography of Mao, it was also a well researched, very revealing look at how Communism (the Maoist version in particular) works.  Mao made Hitler look like an amateur (as did Stalin) yet there are those who still defend him.  Its amazing to me that no one can defend Hitler without being marginalized as a nut (and rightly so) yet people who defend Mao and Communism in general are seen as having a valid point of view.  This book makes that impossible to continue to do.  Everyone should read it in my opinion.  The world will see more men like Mao and as the saying goes, if we don't understand history we're doomed to repeat it.
B000HCO840|3.0|You pay an extra $10-15 bucks for the Collector's Edition and what do you get? A lame comic book and a cardboard box that starts to fall apart the moment you open it.  The DVD is exactly the same as the standard edition.  There is no extra bonus material or extra disc.  This is just a marketing gimick to suck more money out of you.  Don't fall victim to it.
B000093BDX|4.0|\\"Sounds Of Summer\\" is better than the collections \\"Endless Summer\\", \\"Made In The USA\\", and \\"20 Good Vibrations\\", among others. And yes I have owned them all. This is attempting to be the equal of \\"The Beatles 1\\" and \\"Elvis 30 number ones\\", and of course it succeeds. 75 minutes of 30 Beach Boy hits, everything from \\"Surfer Girl\\" to \\"Kokomo\\". And it sounds great too. This is perfect for the casual fan, because it not only gives you the biggest of hits, but minor gems like \\"Don't Worry baby\\", \\"Come Go With Me\\", and \\"I Can Hear Music\\" also. Overall, it's the obvious choice for your first or only Beach Boys disc. And if you think this is just \\"oldies\\" music, guess again.
B000AMPZF8|3.0|This album has a few terrific songs, such as \\"New Born\\", \\"Bliss\\", \\"Plug in Baby\\", and  <br />\\"Feeling Good\\". Unfortunately, it also has it share of filler songs which are a bore to listen to. It is easy to hear now that this was a band that was devoloping their style at the time. Their sound would be fully realized in their next two masterpieces, \\"Absolution\\" and  <br />\\"Black Holes and Revelations\\".  <br /> <br />Matt Bellamy is an excellent singer, but overdoes it at times. I typically would not mind this until I hear a song like \\"Micro Cuts\\", where he decided to sing the entire song in a vibrato-soaked falsetto voice. It is like listening to a guitar player play 32nd notes for five minutes straight. Just because you can do it, does not mean you necessarily have to. <br /> <br />This album is three stars because I heard their full potential in Absolution and BHAR first. If I heard this when it first came out in 2001, it would have been at least 4 stars. However, this is still a very solid album, and it still towers above all of the musical diarrhea that is coming out of mainstream radio and T.V. these days.
B00004RYZT|5.0|The main editorial review is way off.  For one, Du Hast means 'you have'.  Two, Heitare Mich means 'marry me'.  Three, Bück Dich ('bend over') is NOT on the DVD version, regardless of the censorship.  So if you are looking for that live performance, you need to purchase the VHS version of Live Aus Berlin.  Also, don't even look at the main review, because it's obviously a one-sided opinion made by someone with no taste for this type of music.  Look at the customer reviews, which are written by people who appreciate the music.  Having the DVD reviewed by someone who doesn't like the music is like having the KKK commenting on the Family Matters sitcom; it's not happening. <br /> <br />As for what I think, if you like Rammstein, you need this.  Period.  I have shown people who were saying \\"I hate Rammstein, they suck, they have no talent\\" and have had them say to me \\"Holy crap, that's got to be the best live show I've ever seen anyone perform.\\"  So do yourself a favor, and pick this beast up.
B00005JOQS|4.0|Director Bryan Singer (X-men 1 & 2) restores Superman to the silver screen after 19 years utilizing the latest technology to revive the by now 73 year old legend for today's audiences. Singer's adaptation is very true to the late 70ies/80ies films featuring Christopher Reeve. One might even say it's yet another part of the series. The titles are very much like the classic films, even John Williams's famous Superman theme is featured prominently throughout the film and Brandon Routh could be some secret offspring of Christopher Reeve. Kate Bosworth makes a wonderful Lois Lane and best of all Kevin Spacey absolutely rules as Lex Luthor. <br /> <br />In the film Superman returns to Earth after a five year quest through space to learn the world has moved on: Lois Lane has won the Pulitzer Prize for an article entitled \\"Why The World Doesn't Need Superman\\" and has pretty much forgotten all about her savior. In his Clark Kent guise Superman gets his job back at the daily planet, but he struggles to overcome the obstacles he faces in Lois Lane's life: Aside from her anger for leaving without a word she now has a son and a fiance. Superman's arch rival Lex Luthor has successfully conned himself out of his double life sentence and is plotting once again sinister schemes to rule the planet. Only in time does Lois Lane realize that the world does indeed need Superman and so does she.... <br /> <br />The entire film has been shot digitally using Sony's/Panavision's new Genesis camera; the first camera that features a 35mm sized chip for image capturing. Keeping the chip film-sized enables filmmakers to use the wide variety of lenses out there for tradititonal 35mm film cameras and guarantees the same depth of field as we know it from film. Visual effects have increased by leaps and bounds since Richard Donner's 1978 installment yet they also command respect for their efforts back in the day. <br /> <br />All in all Superman Returns is an honest, solid, very well done Superman film, that truth to tell might have benefitted from a little more action here and there, but other than that a valiant effort, a definite DVD to buy!
B000063DI8|4.0|I believe that the argument that this is a good album but not up to Maiden's standards so it receives a lower score is ignorant at best.  The same people who complain that albums like The X Factor are too soft and don't rock enough complain that this album is all shorter, more rocking songs without enough variation.  Choose an argument.<br /><br />I happen to enjoy both albums.<br /><br />Tracks like Tailgunner and Public Enema are what you'd expect from Iron Maiden, upbeat and rocking with high powered guitars, loud and exciting bass lines, Nicko's unclonable drumming, and Bruce's soaring vocals.  These songs contain everything Maiden fans love about the band.  At the same time, No Prayer For the Dying is one of my favorite's on this album because of it's ability to be more emotional than most of this album.  There is more beauty in this one, it really is an underrated song.<br /><br />Mother Russia is another song that many people overlook, this is a really interesting track with it's Russian feel to it.  It may only be 5:30 long but it feels as epic as anything Maiden has written.<br /><br />I feel there is no need to comment on Bring Your Daughter...To the Slaughter because you either enjoy the tongue-in-cheekness of it or despise it, I personally think that there is nothing to dislike about the track.

I can't stop watching the first-fourth seasons!! <br />Lorelai and Rory Gilmore are mother and daughter (only 16 years apart in age) and they are best friends. They live in a small town called Stars Hollow, and they know everyone in their town. Lorelai's parents, Emily and Richard, live in the nearby town of Hartford.

0679422714|4.0|Mao: The Unknown Story is one of those books that is hard to believe. It is hard to believe someone caused the death of so many millions of people, yet little is known about it. It is hard to believe Mao did not care if over half of the earth was killed in a nuclear war as long as he became a dominant world leader. It is hard to believe that Richard Nixon's visit to China was responsible for our withdrawl from Vietnam, the entrance of China into the UN and the security council, and that Nixon traded prestige by his vist (and subsequent votes in the US) for assistance in the modernization of Chineese arms. Ping pong for respect of a terrible tyrant - a poor trade.<br /><br />Yes, this is not an easy read, but a necessary one. How could a mad man play politics so well and succeed in torturing, maiming and killing so many of his own people? Unbelievable! How could someone cause the many years of starvation his people just to become a world power? This is a story that had to be told as most of us would never suspect something so terrible.<br /><br />Just as \\"The Killing Fields\\" is a difficult but necessary film to watch, so is this book. We must know the history to avoid it in the future.
B000301YY8|2.0|I agree with the other reviewers that find his voice annoying.  I hate that he yodels the last syllable of EVERY word.  Just because you CAN do that doesn't mean that you should.  I have no problem with men singing in high voices.  Dexter Holland of the Offspring, Michael Jackson (Don't laugh at me), Freddy Mercury, and Ozzy (back in the day at least) have high male voices...but they don't sound like THIS.  I'm even partial to Colin Meloy of The Decemberists.  \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic (another high-voiced singer) did a much better version of one of these songs called \\"You're Pitiful\\".  I highly recommend you check it out.  My two-star rating is based only on the simple acoustic instrumentation (which I enjoy).
B00028HBKC|5.0|I LOVE this movie So much!  I don't care what kind of trouble Mel Gibson is going thru in his personal life, this movie is really a masterpiece!  It really gets across how much our precious Lord really did suffer for us!  This film makes me want to cry, scream, but mostly it makes me want to CHEER!  And I did!  When I saw it in the theater, and it went off, I yelled \\"NO!!! DON'T GO OFF NOW!!!\\", but it did.  At least we Christians know the rest of the story-WE WIN! PRAISE OUR LORD JESUS!
0618680004|5.0|At last somebody coherently vocalizing all my doubts about the existance of some kind of supreme being. I guess I'd have called myself an agnostic before I read this book, out of sime kind of respect for others faith. No longer; I'm now athiest and proud of it. Why should I pander to others imaginary friends? <br /> <br />The book?  <br />A logical and self consistent critique of the \\"reason\\" behind beliefs in a god figure. Even if you don't accept the premise of the book I'd still recommend you read it, if only to see how the other side thinks.
B000H5U65C|5.0|Mastodon may very well have become the pinnacle of all modern metal with their newest album \\"Blood Mountain.\\" Now of course Mastodon has been ahead of the game quite some time. 2003's \\"Remission\\" was a crushing frenzy that showed the band's technical and innovative approach to song writing, while still hinting at greater things to come. And with 2004's \\"Leviathan,\\" greater things did come. Not only was it a bold move made in the act of creating a concept record about Moby Dick, but Mastodon further expanded their technique, adding atmospheric and melodic elements to their sound in favor of creating something completely original and different from what they had done before. So how would they follow with their much anticipated third full length album \\"Blood Mountain?\\" As if they weren't already masterminds, this record further solidifies Mastodon as the premier innovators in today's metal world. From start to finish \\"Blood Mountain\\" is nothing short of a masterpiece, and if this is the kind of evolution and song writing we can expect Mastodon to expand upon in the future, I can only ask myself, \\"Where and what is next?\\"    Not enough can be said about how impressive the song writing is on this album. Like before stated, Mastodon have an uncanny ability to write epic songs. This means songs which sport buildups, peaks, gradual shifts, intense moments and resolutions. There's never a second that feels out of place or forced, something which is hard to say about most music of the same type. Whether tracks begin overtly heavy or calmly subdued, you always have the feeling that \\"the best is yet to come in the song.\\" And usually it is. Not to mention the fact that all songs are basically free from the \\"verse, chorus, verse\\" writing style, it makes most of the pieces even more impressive. Saying that this record should be listened to front to back is almost a given since both of the previous records the band has produced are of the same nature. However there isn't a moment that feels like it doesn't belong; the flow of the album is absolutely perfect. Constantly twisting and turning, just like climbing a mountain. You start off thunderous, moving forward towards your destination, then for any number of reasons you might vere off and rest for a bit, before going full force to the top again. And finally, the finale, reaching your destination at the top should bring you peace. Mastodon does an excellent job of bringing this to life through the record's structure and its concept.    I hate to sound over-pretentious or giving too much high praise, because we all already know how impressive Mastodon is right? Instead let's talk about the direction the band went for musically on \\"Blood Mountain.\\" Although not as crushing or heavy as much of the older material (most of the bellowing vocals are gone this time around, which isn't bad at all), \\"Blood Mountain\\" still keeps a heavy atmosphere fully intact. The opening tune \\"The Wolf Is Loose,\\" the rocking \\"Hand of Stone\\" and \\"Siberian Divide\\" might be the most outwardly heavy of the bunch. There's much more of an emphasis on melodic crooning of sorts, and the vocal style is actually much more suited towards the musicality of the disc. Like I said before, nothing feels forced or predictable. Brann Dailor, who has been my favorite metal drummer for quite a while now, is back at it with his wonderfully wild approach to writing drum patterns to the songs. No piece of his set is left untouched during the course of most any track, and just listening to this guy play is one of the highlights of the disc. Let's not forget the guitar duo of Brent Hinds and Bill Kelliher though, because these two have written more than their fair share of memorable points for the record. There's still the technically-challenging riffery in place on numbers like \\"Circle Of Cysquatch\\" \\"Bladecatcher\\" and \\"Capillarian Crest,\\" but the atmospheric dabblings of \\"Sleeping Giant\\" and \\"This Mortal Son\\", as well as the subtle acousticstrums on the closer \\"Pendulous Skin\\" might be the most impressive pieces. Troy Sanders, aside from his excellent vocal work, also finds plenty of spots to shine throughout most of the record. Along with the ingenious lyrical concepts that the band continues to dream up, it's hard to see anyone overtaking their position at the premier metal innovators.    \\"Blood Mountain\\" is a record that from first listen, will draw you in. Whether it's just intrigue about how well the songs are crafted, the interesting lyrical concepts running through the disc, the excellent musicianship or the perfect flow the album maintains, something about \\"Blood Mountain\\" will captivate you. Mastodon has done exactly what I hoped they would do this time around, and that was expand their sound even further. They sure are making it hard on themselves, seeing as how every record they release is even more impressive than their previous outing. You almost wonder how they will continue to do this. But if \\"Blood Mountain\\" is any indication, it seems Mastodon is more than ready to tackle that challenge again and again in the future.
B000FTWB7G|3.0|After listening to the previews, only one phrase enters my mind, \\"Where's all the fast-paced rock songs that i am so used to hearing from them?\\" <br /> <br />I actually think they sound a little like Muse with the long held high notes. I'm actually having second guessed to buying this. Sure Amy Lee's voice is beautiful and the lyrics are so pretty but the actual track is a little ...ehh.
B000HCO840|5.0|I loved this movie and cannot understand why anyone who is truly a sci-fi fan could not love this movie.  It was action packed with great special effects and a very well thought out plot.  This combination is almost impossible to find in movies today.  Nothing, since the Terminator II can compare to this movie.  Hats off to everyone involved in this fantastic production.  For those of you who can not apppreciate a gem sci-fi such as this, stick to something you know.
0743454537|4.0|My book club picked this book, and as each of the other members finished the book, they reported to me how much I was going to hate the ending (I'm sort of known in my book club for hating the endings of books).  As I got further and further into the story, which is poignantly written, I saw no good outcome for the ending.  Maybe I was so focused on the obvious endings - without giving anything away - whether Anna would win or lose the lawsuit and what the possible outcomes of each were, but I didn't think the ending was at all predictable, sappy, or \\"Lifetime\\" like.  I really think this was the only way to end the book without being sappy or predictable. <br /> <br />The only thing I didn't like about the book was the resolution of the relationship between Julia and Campbell.  I just didn't buy it.  I'm not a horribly romantic person and I don't believe you can remeet someone years after having a relationship with them and immediately be back \\"in love\\".  I would've been much happier if that story arc remained more open.   <br /> <br />I loved all the reasons Campbell gives for \\"Judge,\\" the dog.  Particularly, \\"I'm a lawyer.  He chases ambulances for me.\\"  But, my favorite character was Brian, who seemed to understand the points of view of everyone and to be truly empathetic.  As I was reading, I looked forward to the portions from his point of view. <br /> <br />I look forward to reading more books by Ms. Picoult.
B00007GZQI|2.0|I had looked forward to seeing this movie for quite a while, being a big Sellers fan and a Ringo/Beatles fan - as well had heard through the grapevine that this was supposed to be a fun and interesting movie. It is neither. Perhaps you could rate it a curiosity - if you happened to be a fan such as myself. The idea of the film would seem to offer great opportunities for both Sellers and Starr to shine, but the script and story (what there was of it) fails to deliver on the promises it alludes to. One strange setting after another ends anti-climatically, which in turn quickly leads to a sense of frustration at a great missed opportunity. It really does seem that they \\"wrote\\" it as they went along, if there was anything written at all. And one tired anti-establishmment cliche after another gives good example why professionals instead of hippies should run with the good ideas in order to see them well executed.

B000BYA5G4|3.0|I like Nicholas Cage movies, although the Weatherman is not what I would classify as a movie, more like a huge train wreck, were bodies and all were caught on film and then labeled as the Weatherman.  More or less, most his Nick Cage's movies are pretty good.  He is a good overall actor and is one of the few men that can handle the lead role in a movie and be basically the sole good character in an entire production such as I felt was the case in 8mm.<br /><br />I wanted to see Lord of War when it came out in the theaters, but since I never got that chance I had to wait until it came out on DVD and lets just say that I'm glad that I waited and didn't pay 8 bucks, and instead rented it for $3.99 at Blockbuster.  Not to say that Lord of War is a bad movie, because it isn't, but what I think really hinders most of Cage's movies is that they are one-dimensional.  The development of the storyline of LOW is good and pretty basic.  And action scenes are decent, but what really gets me about this film is that it jumps around from one story line to the next.<br /><br />At one point in the movie Cage's character is selling his first machine gun in the bedroom of a hotel, the gentlemen buying the gun from Cage takes the gun out of the case and holds it to Cage's head, as if we to display that is a very dangerous business to be in.  I think that is a given, considering that it is illegal arms dealing and every body that are going to encounter in this business is breaking the law of every country throughout the world that has a legit government.  The next thing you know Cage is at a worldwide conference of arms, and arm smuggling.  What struck me is how he went from small time, one gun at a time dealer to rubbing arms with the big wheels of the business just like that.  I would have liked a little bit more detail of how you become the Lord of War.<br /><br />Of course, just like in any business contacts are the most important aspect and that is defiantly true it the arm running business as this movie plainly shows.  But I believe that there is not enough detail in the movie of how the relationships are started, maintained and carried out in a business, which could land you years behind bars throughout most of the world.  Cage is simply too cool throughout the movie in a business that probably gets a lot of people killed each year.  And to me that coolness factor played well in a movie like Matchstick Men, when the stakes were relatively low(a few million dollars) versus this movie where he played the middleman by selling weapons that killed thousands of people in many countries throughout the world.  To me, this movie needed a leading man more like out of the Harrison Ford type, rigid, rough, strong and could be a totally nice guy that would blow your brains out if he needed to.  The type of guy that you could trust if you were going to make a deal with him, but that you would not mind taking out because he was a totally jerk and you didn't care for him in the first place.<br /><br />LOW is a three and half star movie that could have had better story development, character development and perhaps could have been rolled into two movies considering that the subject of the movie is a large one.  But then again, how many other movies are about American men of Russian decent selling gun on a worldwide level?  Not many, and that is why I think a better job could have been done making this one.m running business as this movie plainly shows.

078322947X|3.0|You have to admire Friedkin for the way he tackled this project. He was in awe of the French thriller \\"The Wages of Fear\\" (1953) and challenged himself to do an original retelling of the story. He refused to borrow the best elements of that classic and just took the basic storyline; totally altering its film-making style and carefully excising the very elements he most admired in the original-substituting his own ideas and avoiding any hint of taking the easy way out. Even insisting on a title that reflected not the film but the process of transforming the original into something very different; and it was a two year $22 million process. This was his masterpiece (he had earned the chance with two big hits-\\"The French Connection\\" and \\"The Exorcist\\") and he wanted \\"The Wages of Fear\\" to be his inspiration, not his blueprint. <br /> <br />So instead of a subtle off-camera explosion, \\"Sorcerer\\" graphically illustrates the event. Instead of a languid first half character study he shows short action-oriented background segments. Instead of an undefined location (filmed in the south of France it could be anywhere from the Middle East to South America) he titles his locations and sets the main story in Venezuela (filmed in the jungles of the Dominican Republic).  <br /> <br />And on the most fundamental level the claustrophobic closeness of \\"The Wages of Fear\\" (its most unique and pervasive element) is replaced with a distanced perspective. Tight shots become wide shots, interior scenes are brought outside, a bigger budget transforms intimacy into scale. While you especially admire Friedkin for taking this risk, it is unfortunately the film's fatal flaw (at least comparatively). Without the tight shots in the truck cabs and the evolving relationships between the characters, there is little to identify with and no real point of view established. Because the motivations are superficial, the reactions are unconvincing and the suspense less involving.  <br /> <br />What is leftis a good action picture without the basic themes and extreme dimensionality of the original.  <br /> <br />Four desperate men lack the funds to escape Porvenir, a backwater village in South America. Nilo (Francisco Rabal) is an assassin from a Central American city, Kassen (Amidou) is a Palestinian bomber, Victor (Bruno Cremer) is a white collar criminal from Paris, and Jackie (Roy Scheider) is a small time American hood fleeing a mob contract. When a revolutionary group sets fire to an oil rig, the company offers big bucks to anyone who will drive a load of very unstable explosives 200 miles to the wellhead; where they will be used to blow out the fire. <br /> <br />Amidou was Friedkin's only first choice for a part, the other three parts were offered to actors who turned them down and he was forced to settle for this cast.  Which could  be one reason that Friedkin pulled back his camera and minimized the acting component of the film.  <br /> <br />For some reason a great deal of time is spent filming the men repairing two junked trucks, getting them ready for the expedition. Then they are off and the superiority of \\"The Wages of Sin\\" begins to really show. In that film an early obstacle is a hairpin turn that requires the trucks to back up. What happens to the first truck sets the viewer up for the difficulties that the second truck will have. In \\"Sorcerer\\" Friedkin substitutes a more elaborate bridge, but the sequential technique does not work nearly as well. <br /> <br />There is some astonishing cinematography in this part of the film, and a gripping musical score by Tangerine Dream.   It would be nice to have it available in the original widescreen format. <br /> <br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
B000GFRJ58|5.0|This is a 5-star album. Period.  And while I lobbied for a decent remaster, I certainly never expected all this.  They did a very good (not great) job of remastering, and you get your choice of conventional CD stereo, Dolby DVD stereo or Dolby DVD 5.1.  No DTS, unfortunately.  I know I'm picking nits, but I don't find the 5.1 mix all that alluring.  First, the sound is anemic, requiring much more volume and amp power to get a decent listening experience.  The mix lacks punch and high end and is not at all realistic, e.g. the drums are all in the right front channel, kind of a throwback to the \\"2-track\\" stereo mixes of the 60s.  Also, some of the vocal tracks are different, which is OK, I guess, but off-putting and not as good as the finished vocal tracks.  It's one of the most curious, and disappointing surround sound mixes I've heard.  I don't know how the stereo master can be so much improved from the previous LP and CD releases, yet the 5.1 mix sound so different and disappointing.    But, honest, I'm not complaining.  You don't have to listen to the 5.1 mix, it's there if you want it, and I'm well pleased with the stereo mixes. The CD stereo remaster seems a bit better than the Dolby DVD remaster, but they are close.    At any rate, I am glad they finally remastered this classic album, and the extras are very much appreciated.
B000H305U0|4.0|I never have a problem telling people that I never liked N Sync.  The only 2 songs that I ever liked that they did were \\"This I Promise You\\" and \\"Gone\\".   It even took alot of convincing from a friend of mine that liked music to buy \\"Justified\\".  He told me that the CD had a r&b feel to it although N Sync strictly did pop music 99.9% of the time.  Once I purchased \\"Justified\\", I was impressed by Mr. JT, as Timbaland called him on \\"(Oh No) What You Got)\\".   My favorite tracks ended up being \\"Last Night\\", \\"Take It From Here\\", \\"Still On My Brain\\", \\"Like I Love You\\" w/Clipse, and \\"Cry Me A River\\" as well as, \\"(Oh No) What You Got\\".   <br /> <br />I read an article on mtv.com talking about how the Neptunes would not be producing any tracks on Justin's 2nd CD, so I was a bit worried until I heard that Timbaland was handling the majority of the production.   The mtv.com article also talked of how Justin's 2nd CD had a Prince feel to it.  So when I read that, I was assured since Prince is one of my favorite artists that Justin would have atleast a decent 2nd CD. <br /> <br />The first single from \\"Future Sex/Love Sounds\\" is the Timbaland produced \\"Sexy Back\\".  I wasn't sure what to think of the track when I first heard it, but after a few listens the track has definitely grown on me.  If you hear this track at a party even the guys on the wall will do a two step to this song.  What ends up being the best song, in my opinion, on \\"Future Sex/Love Sounds\\" is the 2nd single featuring TI entitled \\"My Love\\".  The intro of the track actually starts at the end of \\"Sexy Ladies\\" which is a bit weird, because if the intro and the track was Track 4 things would work out better.  Timbaland and Justin go back and forth rapping and then the midtempo track starts shortly thereafter.  If anyone thought Justin's career would end with \\"Justified\\", they will be sadly mistakened when they hear this track.  TI has a nice verse on the track as well.  The title track will have you thinking you'reback in the 80s just like \\"Sexy Back\\".  Justin must have been listening to CDs like \\"Purple Rain\\", \\"1999\\" and \\"LoveSexy\\" by how his lyrics are so sexually suggestive.   However, Timabaland produces another banger and Justin makes things work.  \\"What Goes Around\\" is a nice track as well.   After a few listens, you will definitely think that the song is \\"Cry Me A River Part 2\\".   Justin seems as if he is telling the same woman that you did me wrong and now karma is coming back to get the particular female.  The interlude after the track works as well as it finishes up the track in a nice fashion as Justin sings and you can hear Timbaland in the background saying \\"What Goes Around Comes Back Around\\".  \\"Sexy Ladies\\" will have you looking for one of your Morris Day and The Time CDs like \\"What Time Is It?\\" and \\"Ice Cream Castles\\".   This track has an 80s funk feel to it and once again things work out pretty well.   Timbaland speeds up the pace on the phrenetic \\"Love Stoned\\".  Things will seem crazy to you at first but by the end of the track you'll be sweating on the dance floor anyway.  Timbaland and Justin work the same formula on \\"Future Sex/Love Sounds\\" that the Neptunes and Timbaland had on \\"Justified\\".   A 360 degree turn from anything that Justin ever did on any N Sync CD.  Justin and Three 6 Mafia form a Tennessee connection on \\"Chop Me Up\\".  Timbaland provides a nice track and even adds some lyrics to this midtempo banger.  He even goes as far as chopping and screwing up part of the hook, which works since Three 6 Mafia are on the track.  Justin is able to express how he feels about a particular female and Timbaland and 3-6 are there to lend an assist as well.  Timbaland slows the pace down on \\"Until The End Of Time\\", which has a Prince ballad written all over it.  When you hear the song you will immediately think \\"International Lover\\" or \\"When 2 R In Love\\".  Some Prince fans may not like Justin's slow jam sounding that close to a Prince track but things still work for me and I think most JT fans will like the track as well.  Justin takes a break from the sexiness to get serious to a Timbaland track on \\"Losing My Way\\".   Justin talks about issues that are going on in the world as he describes different scenarios that anyone in the world could be going through.   The great Hezekiah Walker and The Love Fellowship Choir even end up ending the song, which becomes very powerful by its end.   The album's surprise gem has to come from Rick Rubin, yes the same great Rick Rubin who worked with early Def Jam acts like The Beastie Boys and LL Cool J, producing a stellar slow jam in \\"All Over Again\\".  When I looked at the album credits and saw that he produced this track I was in disbelief.   Any time you hear a Rick Rubin jam in any form of rap or r&b music you never expect to hear anything like this.  Justin's lyrics go well with the track and hopefully down the road this track will be a single. <br /> <br />The only faults that I have with Future Sex/Love Sounds are some of the songs don't stand up with the best songs on the CD.  The Will I Am produced \\"Damn Girl\\" is a decent track, but compared to the rest of the CD it doesn't measure up, in my opinion.   The same can be said with \\"Summer Love\\" and the Snoop Dogg featured, \\"Pose\\".    Also, if you are a fan of \\"Justified\\", you will find yourself wishing that there were some Neptunes tracks on here to differentiate the songs that Timbaland produced.  In some ways, many of the songs sound similar and may be a negative effect on how some people think of \\"Future Sex/Love Sounds\\".  I see that many people are talking negatively about the interludes.  However, I feel that the interludes do an excellent job enhancing the songs, eventhough the interludes do make the tracks longer. <br /> <br />Overall, I am a fan of \\"Future Sex/Love Sounds\\".  I appreciate the fact that Justin is using his solo CDs to perform the sound that he likes the best which is rhythm and blues.  If you are a fan of r&bmusic, it doesn't matter what race you are to be able to perform it.   Justin shouldn't receive any backlash because he is a white artist performing r&b music eventhough he did alot of pop music with N Sync.  If you are a fan of Justin Timberlake and you enjoyed \\"Justified\\", then you should also pick up \\"Future Sex/Love Sounds\\". <br /> <br />James' Top 5 <br /> <br />1) My Love w/TI <br />2) All Over Again  <br />3) Sexy Back <br />4) Future Sex/Love Sound <br />5) Until The End Of Time   <br /> <br />
B000DN6ZGC|5.0|I agree with alot of these reviews! I won't be so detailed with my review, but i'll say, I was hesitant about buying this CD, but I a glad I did! Her sound reminds me of Sade and Norah Jones. I really like it!
B00000K3UU|4.0|If there is one thing that Adam Sandler does well, that's comedy, and Big Daddy is just that: a good comedy. <br />The movie brings to the screen the story of a good-hearted though rather lazy and immature young man who in an effort to save his relationship attempts to impress his girlfriend by adopting a five-year-old boy!    <br />Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.   <br />The setting, the plot, and the dialogues are all good, though what was the point of incorporating a homosexual couple into this movie?  It came out of the blue and served no purpose whatsoever, except to taint the overall mood. <br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment. <br />
B0002DB0FO|5.0|When this show went off the air I, as well as many others, was devastated.  This is acting at its best.  I love the unfolding and nuance of the relationship between Amy and Ephram.  It is so sensitively written. You will welcome them into your home and heart.
B00005JP5J|2.0|Everyone else I have talked to who has seen this movie thought it was hilarious and loved it. I thought it well done but very distasteful.    Self-absorbed neglectful parents; sad, angry, ignored son desperate to escape his dysfunctional family; invisible daughter who is left by her oblivious parents to spend way too much time with her foul-mouthed, heroin-snorting, porn-loving grandfather; middle-aged gay uncle mourning the loss of his opportunistic boy-toy by trying to commit suicide; this movie has all the ingredients of a great comedy!     Yes, there are a few funny bits, but I left this movie thinking it a scathing inditement of the child porn - sorry I mean child pagent - industry and the parents who prostitute their young daughters into it.
B00004YKUY|4.0|When Journey came out with their 1996 \\"Trial By Fire\\" album, the fans were hopeful to see the Journey that they remembered was back for good.  Unfortunately, that was to be the last album with lead singer Steve Perry (read my \\"Trial By Fire\\" review to about this transition period).<br /><br />Jump ahead five years to 2001 and enter new lead singer Steve Augeri and drummer Deen Castronovo.  Steve Augeri is no Steve Perry - he doesn't have the range - however, I've seen the \\"new\\" Journey twice in concert and he does a nice job of filling that role.  Even he admits in interviews that he's \\"riding the crest\\" of the former lead singer.  He is very humble and feels privileged to be in the group.<br /><br />With that said, what about former drummer Steve Smith?  Apparently he left the 1996 reunion when he found out that Steve Perry was no longer in the group.  His replacement was a buddy of Jon Cain's and Neil Schon's from the Bad English years.  Deen does a nice job of drumming, but lacks the fine technique and touch that Steve Smith put into his playing.  Steve Smith is an incredible jazz drummer.  It is this reviewer's opinion that those techniques help to \\"round out\\" and not limit a drummer's playing, giving the musician a larger palette to draw from.<br /><br />The album, on the whole, is very good.  There's a lot of music on it - fifteen tracks!  It is very apparent that they are drawing from the past; it's almost as if \\"Departure\\" meets \\"Trial By Fire.\\"  There is very little of the big synths associated with \\"Frontiers\\" and \\"Raised on Radio,\\" and more acoustic piano and organ.  The song structures are less pop and more rock-sounding - one would almost think that Gregg Rollie had a hand in writing a few of the tracks.  Songs like \\"Higher Place,\\" \\"I Got A Reason,\\" and \\"To Be Alive Again\\" all lean back to the \\"Departure\\" days, but with a new sound.  \\"Livin' To Do\\" is a ballad written by Neal Schon about his recovery over his father's death.  This song is so well done it could have been included on the \\"Dream After Dream\\" soundtrack.  Then there's \\"Kiss Me Softly\\" that sounds like it came off of Schon's solo album \\"Electric World\\" - another well done tune.<br /><br />There's always a downside to an album and this one has its share of duds.  There are too many sappy ballads, all attempts at revitalizing their success with \\"When You Love a Woman.\\"  Tracks 2, 5 and 9 are just filler.  Having heard their most recent album, \\"Generations,\\" I can review this album with hindsight. Tendencies towards the \\"new sound\\" rears it's ugly head in \\"All The Things\\" and \\"Nothin' Comes Close\\" (please read my review on this album for further information).<br /><br />All in all, it's one that I would recommend to any Journey fan.  If you're a diehard Steve Perry fan, you probably won't like it.  However, if you're a diehard Journey fan, you won't be disappointed.  Remember...

B000FTWB7G|3.0|I realize that I will probably be shouted down for saying anything disparaging about this album, but I have to be honest.  This album was a disappointment for me.  Let's talk turkey here.  I'll start with the good.  Amy has a great voice and it can really get under your skin and stay with you.  I loved her voice on Fallen, however here she has stretched herself to a new place and is doing things I think she simply wasn't ready for in the past.  The songs are well written and most of them stick in your head and are worthy of repeat listening.  If you are an Amy fan then I have no doubt you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br />So, what's my problem with it?  First off, what made Fallen so great was the rawness of it.  It was unpolished and unapologetic about it.  It made the album very in your face and deeply personal to the listener.  The songs were held up by Amy's voice and some really cool guitar riffs.  The lyrics were dark, haunting and deliciously beautiful.  Everything the second album is not (for me).  The new album is way too polished and way, way over produced (I have no doubt the record company had everything to do with that).  In spite of her much better vocal work (technically) I found a lot of her new techniques kind of cliche and put a lot of distance between her and the listener; much less personal and much more mainstream.  The guitar work is, well, kind of boring; not nearly as crunchy and erratic, once again too main-streamish.  A powerful tool in music is the ability to use dissonance in your work.  It can add a lot of impact to a piece.  It is WAY overused here.  Too much dissonance and then it becomes overpowering and takes away from the flow of your song.  I was simply unhappy with a lot of the songs and the ones I do like just don't have the same \\"feel\\" as Fallen and I found my mind wandering when playing the album. <br /> <br />Overall I am unhappy with the new album, especially considering how long I waited for it.  It seemed like it tookf-o-r-e-v-e-r to finally see the light of day.  Now, that it's here I'm sad that the sound of Evanescence has changed so much.  Amy kicks serious behind, but I think that 50% of the creative genius of the first album walked out the door.  I'm still a fan and I'm not sad that I bought the album, but it will get very limited listening time after spinning it four or five times.  Part of my problem is that in getting bored waiting for this album to hit the shelves I stumbled upon a huge untapped market of great metal/gothic/whatever type bands with powerful female vocalists.  I got spoiled by some of the HUGE, HUGE talent out there; bands like Within Temptation, Stream of Passion, The Gathering, Beseech, Xandria, Mortal Love, Ambeon to name a few and even some more technical bands like Nightwish, Nemesea and whole slew of others.  If you get bored and want some other bands in your repetoire, then I recommend checking some of them out. <br /> <br />Most importantly though, I am in no way saying that The Open Door is a bad album.  I am also in no way dissing Amy.  I am simply sharing my limited viewpoint and nothing more.  So, try to keep the flames down to a minimum.  ;)

If you have a passion for science fiction mystery or just science fiction in general this book is for you. Those of you who have seen the movies like I,ROBOT, Blade Runner, or Metropolis will find yourselves wrapped up in this enticing view of not only our planets future but also the future of life in this galaxy. The obviousness of this whodunnit is very subtle throughout the story and you will find yourself smacking your forehead when you realize what actually happened in the end.

B000G7PMD2|5.0|To write a review for any DT album is a very difficult task to me, because in my opinion Dream Theater is the best band I've ever heard, simply the best and therefore sometimes I feel I could not be very objective on my opinions because I really love this band.    Every album is the best but never better than the other ones they realeased that could not happen `cause they are very different one from the other, so it happens with every live album they released now SCORE is the 5th live album by DT and to be honest when I read the track list I was a little bit sceptical but inside of me I truly believ I was going to like this album so I wait fo its realease, now I been listening to Score for over a month and I still have no word to describe this masterpiece.    Let me start by saying that on March 06 Dream Theater performed at the National Auditorium in Mexico and believe me is the best concert I have ever attend to (includind the other Mexico's performances), I was at 1st row and I could feel the music as I have never before it was the perfect concert and to me it could never be repeated, just the best day of my life and for that reason I really wanted a Live album of this tour, I really believed they played pefectly and James sang as he has never befored... flawless, believe me it was so perfect that even my wife (who is not a DT fan as myself) was banging with their music, it was mindblowing simply perfect, the track list, the mood, their attitude, their performance everything was over the top and for that reason when I read the track list of Score I was a little bit dissappointed, because to me the Mexico's track list was perfect so I wanted to be repeated on the Score album... that doesn't happen not even close and today I love this set list because in Score you can hear (and see) how DT has evolved through the last 20 years...    Something that for me was perfect is that they don't include for the 1st time a Pull me under version, it's not that I don't love thissong I really do, but it appears on every DT live album, so now it is a perfect change; the combination of songs is one of the best of all the live albums, and let me tell you the preveously unreleased songs are becoming favorites to me, Another Won, Afterlife, Raise the Knife is so great, is really unblelievable they did't realeased this song yet..    Th perfomances are as usual impressive but I am going to concentrate on James's voice, it was unbelievable, in Mexico he sang flawlessly and believe me one of his best nights but in Score he was even impressive, I believe he is singing as never before, in my opinion he sounds better than in studio if you really apreciate the way he sangs then you're gonna love this album, about Jordan, John, Mike & John Petrucci what can I said that hasn't been said before, they are simply geniuses and in Score theY prove it again    The Orchestra part... well what can I said when I first read that on April they will play with an orchestra I was so excited I knew already it will be so breathtaking an yes it was so nicely blended it seems like those songs were composed to be played with orchestra it was really beautiful but the important things was that every song was even more powerful than the studio version so they were arranged mastefully.    In Score you will find songs that weren't released or it would be very difficult to have such as Innocence faded, Another won, Afterlife & Six degrees on its enterity and believe it worth the time for them to be relesead they sound incredible.    My top 5 of this album would be:    1. Octavarium (the petrucci's solo an the end worths the whole album the live and studio ones)  2. Raise the Knife (One of my DT favorites at this moment)  3. Six degrees (The end is so impressive)  4. Sacified Sons   5. Root of all Evil, Metropolis, The Spirit carries on, AfterLife (so difficult to chose only 5¡¡¡¡¡)    Again its hard to tell if this is the best DT live album I really have mixed feelings about this but afet a month of listening everyday in my IPOD, in my car, in my house and on my PC I think that yes this si simply the best live album, not because the tracklist or the band performance (which is flawless on every album, except for James who sound tired on some songs on the other albums) or the orchestra, simply because for the first time you can hear James singing perfect, flawless and that gives the extra point to make SCORE the best live album on DT's careers.... Obviously I am waiting for the next albums to come..    Once again DT gave us a masterpiece Score is so great, if you like DT go and buy this album it worths every penny you pay for, it is a 10 STARS ALBUM.. what a way to celebrate¡¡¡¡¡

B0001XALTG|5.0|Being Scottish, maybe I'm biased but this is a brilliant, laugh out loud funny , film. I looked at its reviews on the US Amazon site just to see what the Americans made of it - especially the accents. They're really not that \\"thick\\" as many reviewers state - I think even viewers from England understood them. <br />Also, Trainspotting is intentionally funny; our sense of humour is not the same as yours though. Don't even think of reading the book if you found the accents unintelligible - its full of colloquial Scots (not Scotch - thats the drink).Theres also many even more gruesome scenes in the book than in the film. <br />
B0002V7ODI|4.0|Comic book movies is another trend in Hollywood that's slowly starting to die out. Like horror movie remakes and ultra-gory new ones to the CGI-animated ones, Hollywood always goes to what's the next big thing. Granted there is the occasional oddball that completely gets a cult following but you mainly see a trend and familiarity. When X-Men became a surprise hit, everything got bought up. Turns out though that Hellboy was actually a pet project for years by Guillermo del Toro, director of films like Blade II and the recent Pan's Labyrinth. Upon watching the film, you get the feeling that it's not outright terrible like Daredevil, it's just you were almost hoping it'd be a tad better.<br /><br />In 1944, Nazis in Germany have been interested in the Occult and they're planning on bring forth a creature from a portal that can turn the Earth into an apocalyptic wasteland. They're stopped in time but something gets through: a small devil-like red creature with horns, a tail and a big right arm. He grows up, named Hellboy, with the help of Dr. Bloom and his friend Abe Sapien, a fish/humanoid-like creature. He harbors a love for his former flame Liz which gets threatened when the FBI sends over an agent named Myers to watch over him. Of course it isn't helped that Rasputin and 2 others want to again bring forth the Apocalypse.<br /><br />It's strange that I actually haven't found an outright terrible comic book movie(oops, almost missed Batman and Robin, sorry) but even lambasted ones like Daredevil, Hulk or Fantastic Four had some likability. For all their faults, whether it's casting the main lead(Daredevil) to unnecessary scenes(Hulk) to just general okayness(Fantastic Four), they were at least films that I didn't felt like I demanded my money back. Hellboy is similar in that it's actually a pretty solid comic book film. It feels like a comic book film and not just a world that so happens to have superheroes. Ultimately the big problem with the film is that it doesn't seem to go beyond its limitations. Sure it's got creatures and such but the film doesn't really reach the heights of the best of previous comic book movies it just sits there.<br /><br />Where the film does excel as well is in its casting in particular Ron Perlman who always tends to play those brash mouthy types. Well it fits with Hellboy. Unlike brooder Batman or squeaky clean Superman, Hellboy smokes cigars and has a very sarcastic attitude. Everyone else is fine but either Selma Blair was the wrong choice for Liz or she just wasn't given enough to do. Points for casting David Hyde Pierce has the voice for nerdy Abe though. The only thing that is slightly disappointing is Rasputin as a villain is just not as threatening as he should be.<br /><br />Unlike some directors who prefer to leave film in that mystery place where making a film shouldn't be explained and dissected but experienced, del Toro loves DVD apparently so the disc is quite packed with no less than 3 commentaries, a documentary longer than the movie as well as branching options and a neat but kind of pointless booklet included. I always find it fascinating to watch how enough special features can change your appreciation of a movie and you get a better understanding of Hellboy when you watch them.<br /><br />I actually blind-bought Hellboy so who knows how you'll react to it but I didn't feel I wasted my money, which is quite the rarity lately. It may not be Superman or X-Men 2 but at least it's an entertaining movie.n't seem to go beyond its limitations.

B00005JMJG|5.0|The title of this film is taken from a poem written by Alexander Pope entitled \\"Eloisa to Abelard\\".  Pope based his poem upon the lives of two real people who were involved in an illicit affair.  The poem is written from Eloisa's point of view and illustrates the conflict the woman has between her deep love for Abelard and her devotion to God.  The movie takes it's name from the lines, \\"How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot!/The world forgetting, by the world forgot./ Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!/Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.\\" in which Eloisa wonders what it would be like if she had never fallen in love with Abelard and had the affair erased from her life.<br /><br />That idea, of being able to erase one's memories, is the plot structure in which ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND revolves.  The film stars Jim Carrey as Joel Barish, a shy man who usually keeps to himself but who thought he had found the love of his life in a woman named Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet).  Clementine is everything that Joel is not and the two individuals discover that not only do they complement each other, but that they complete each other as well.  However, after a particular messy argument, Joel receives a notice that Clementine has had all memory of him erased from her mind.  Joel tries to force the relationship afresh and fails. He realizes that he cannot live knowing that the love of his life has no memory of him and decides to have the procedure done himself.  While undergoing the memory-erasure, Joel begins to remember all the good times he had and everything about Clementine that made him fall in love with her in the first place.  He then tries to fight the erasing by hiding out with Clementine in other memories in his mind.  Think of a bizarre and quirky IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.<br /><br />That might sound very confusing and that's not even taking into consideration that's not how the plot of the movie takes place because we see the story in reverse (kind of like MEMENTO) from the time Joel and Clementine had their last argument until they first met.  Of course, the movie actually begins more towards the end rather than the beginning and ends at a new beginning.  The film also has a small subplot about the Dr. in charge of the procedure (Tom Wilkinson) and one of his employees (Kristen Dunst).  Despite the labyrinth structure, ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is one of the best romantic movies of the past decade.  It's a very honest film, full of emotion and heart.  It doesn't sugarcoat the hardships and sometimes seemingly dullness that a relationship can bring, but illustrates that the good times far outweigh all of that and that even if they didn't, those difficulties are important because they make us who we are and help us to become better people.<br /><br />Besides the story and wonderful script (written by Charlie Kaufman), ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is notable for a couple of other reasons. First, the movie is one of Jim Carrey's best performances ever.  Carrey has given some Oscar-worthy performances before (THE TRUMAN SHOW, MAN ON THE MOON) but his performance as Joel is his best to date.  If you had never seen Jim Carrey perform before, you would never know that he became famous because of his comedy--you would think he was a Shakespearean-trained actor.  He should have been nominated for a Best Actor Oscar here, too, but wasn't.<br /><br />Secondly, the film is a great example of how a movie with a lot of special effects can be made without using a lot of CGI.  All of the bizarre scenes were created using good old fashioned tricks through manipulation of the camera, set, props, editing, or lighting.<br /><br />ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is one of those films that people are either going to love or are going to hate.  I enjoyed the film immensely.  It stayed in my head for weeks.  Both the story and filmmaking are inspiring.  But that's just me. Maybe you'll hate it. If that's the case, you might want to visit Lacuna Inc.<br /><br />The DVD includes an informative making-of featurette (explains how some of the best stuff in the movie wasn't really scripted), some deleted scenes, a conversation with Carrey and director Michael Gondry, a Lacuna infomercial, a music video, and a commentary.visit Lacuna Inc.

B000089RVX|2.0|I got this CD because I loved their radio hits \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and \\"My Immortal.\\" While those songs are beautiful, they are not representative of the rest of the album. Although I tried and tried to get into this CD, the hard rock teen goth style just isn't my cup of tea, and the lyrics are too depressing. If you are a fan of bands such as Linkin Park or Seether, you might enjoy this. However, if you only like \\"My Immortal\\" and \\"Bring Me To Life\\" because of Amy's powerful vocals, you'd be better off listening to Tori Amos or Sarah McLachlan.
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|Thought I'd check into System of a Down recently since somewhere in them, they have an ability to put their finger on what's wrong with America(and in some cases, the whole lot of us monkeys). They managed some able commentary in \\"Violent Pornography\\" on the twin phenomena of how we degrade ourselves with cheap consumable sexuality in our social lives and take it in on TV as well, and it doesn't seem to matter if anyone is getting exploited(including ourselves) while we indulge. It's a non stop disco, who cares if we all suck? Just keep dancing and screwing and ogling...and now a word from our sponsor. Stay tuned.  <br /> <br />That song was interesting enough to make me buy Mezmerize. <br /> <br />Wrong move. <br /> <br />This CD is terrible, with the exception of the above song and maybe two others. I'd heard snippets of System over the years and always considered this Serj fellow's voice to be the signature of the band. That voice has been replaced mostly on Mezmerize by the principal songwriter and guitarist's voice. To put it mildly, it's a double sin to backseat Serj's operatic and sarcastic sneer of a voiceto anyone-and then on top of that consider an acceptable subsitute the mewling, tinny voice of Daron the guitarist.  <br /> <br />One last thing, many here complain that this album is too political. I say huh? This wasn't political enough...a band as seemingly astute and able enough to communicate politics in music as these guys are has, I daresay, a responsibility to be as frickin' political as possible. But this is crap as a political statement, a few melodramatic throwaway verses on \\"BYOB\\" and \\"Sad Statue\\" and that's all you really get that is political, which is inexcusable given what is going on in America's name today. <br /> <br /> The rest of the disc is incomprehensible and lame. If this band has anything else to say, it had better reconsider releasing empty product like this in the future, because they have gotten their last dollar from this sucker...and many others, judging from the large number of pans this CD has gotten. <br />
0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins puts forward one of the great concepts in business...and in life...that getting the right people in the right situations is the best staple of great leadership.  Collins' message can be applied to any situation (business, sports, education, etc.).  He has an engaging writing style and uses a wide variety of companies to illustrate his central theme of leadership as leading to great success.  Collins also illustrates the great importance of a humble leader, one who gives of him/herself for the betterment of the system as a whole.  This was a fascinating read, and you will close the book with a great deal of insight into how you run both your professional and personal life.  A terrific, terrific read.  In fact, I have gone back and begun to read Built to Last, which is actually the prequel to Good to Great.  I honestly could not recommend this book more than I do.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Congratulations to Al Gore for taking on a subject largely regarded as anathema by the US political establishment. In both the book and dvd, the information is presented starkly but in a nonetheless straight forward format. For those already with an interest in global warming, most of the issues raised will probably be what you have already come across but nonetheless be prepared for some new information or insights. For anyone who has yet to examine the scientific concerns on global warming, then this is a very good place indeed to start. Some have criticised the inclusion of Al Gore's real life experiences. I, however, think that they actually complement the information that is being put across. Yes the science is still unsure on many of the issues, however, it IS becoming increasingly apparent that C02 emissions from industry, petrol engines etc are contributing to driving global temperatures upwards. That said, there is truth though that global warming is a natural event because thanks to analysis carried out on ice samples from the Greenland permafrost, thousands of years old, we have a clear record of many natural warming cycles going back millennia.<br />The question we have to ask ourselves is do we really need to be adding to this natural process to the point of endangering our environment and even our existence?<br /><br />Increasingly powerful hurricanes and storms like Katrina will become more common. As ice flows shrink, there will be corresponding rises in sea levels, and more heavily populated areas will experience the horror that hit New Orleans.<br />However, I would like to add some new scenarios into the already troubling possibilities:<br /><br />Firstly, Science has established that thanks to the reduction in the use of CFCs we are seeing an improvement in the Ozone hole over the Antarctic. However, scientists are now concerned that heavy C02 releases in the northern hemisphere could cool the upper atmosphere to the point that new holes in Ozone layer open up over the Arctic, bringing the danger of UV rays with them as they do so...<br /><br />Secondly, before the age of the dinosaurs, there was a period known as the Permian. The end of this period saw the biggest ever mass extinction that this planet has ever seen, where upwards of 90% of all life perished. It was thought that the killer was a meteorite bigger than the one that took out the dinosaurs. Recent science has found that there were in fact two killers, and neither was a meteorite.<br />The first was massive volcanic action in the region of Siberia which was so huge that it raised global temperatures by 5C. This killed off many species of life. However, once the seas had heated up by 5C, then this was  the key that released the second killer from its confinement - Methane Gas. Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gasses in existence and releasing large quantities of it into the atmosphere will cause warming on a greater scale than that caused by emissions of C02.<br />Surrounding the coastlines of all continents are huge pockets of methane that are stored in the ocean floor, and have come from millennia of decaying organic matter rolling off the continents and into the sea. These deposits are called Methane Hydrates. What happened is that after the temperatures rose at the end of the Permian, the sea temperature rose by 5C, causing the Methane Hydrates to release vast quantities of Methane into the atmosphere. This promptly raised global temperatures by a further 5C, killing off virtually all marine life and even more of the life on the land.<br /><br />So there you have it folks. A temperature rise of 10C caused the greatest mass extinction that this world has ever seen. And here we are, contributing our own gasses to a warming cycle..... despite the fact that there are huge quantities of Methane Hydrates just offshore (just ask the oil industry as to the hazards they create for offshore drilling). Scientific tests have shown that if water temperature in the oceans rises by 5C then the Methane Hydrates will release all their gas......<br /><br />As the song says \\"Something better change...\\"he Methane Hydrates will release all their gas......    As the song says \\"Something better change...\\"

0307346609|2.0|i whole heartedly agree with daniel b. below. nowhere near as fun as the zombie survival guide, which i loved. too much left wing politics, not enough zombies.  <br /> <br />on the other hand, you have to expect some explanation/point of view from the author as to why he's writing zombie fiction in the first place, and max gives you that, like it or not. at least he took his stand. <br /> <br />i don't care about this book, but i hope they make the 'survival guide' into a movie somehow. maybe a 'crocodile hunter' docudrama type treatment. it was hilarious.
0307346609|5.0|This was an amazingly good zombie book. I started reading last night at 10 o'clock and finally had to put it down at 3 in the morning. I got up at 8 am, started reading again and didn't go to work until I was finished. Yes, I am a slow reader, and yes this is one of those books that sucks you in from the first page and which you can't put down, not for sleep, work, pets, or family. I knew from the moment I read the first few lines of the introduction that this was going to be a great read. One of my favorite experiences is when a book grabs you by the throat from the first page and this novel delivers that experience in spades.<br /><br />The story is told as a series of vignettes of personal experiences during the initial plague outbreak, the Great Panic that followed, and the slow recovery over ten years as humanity battles back. If you have ever read any Studs Terkel you already know this is a powerful and compelling way to tell a story. My hat is off to the author because he does something I haven't seen in any other zombie book through these vignettes...he fully explores the how the plague would start, sputter and lurch, and then spread just like all diseases do. He also fully explores world-wide ramifications and tells the stories of individuals from many countries so you see how the zombie plague was dealt with in all areas of the world and on all continents. He deals with political, economic, environmental and military issues in a startling cohesive and plausible manner. This book isn't the typical 'zombies take over the world in two weeks and there are only seven people left' fiction...no, this feels like what it could actually be like in a very believable manner. The sheer realism of this book makes it stand out in this genre.<br /><br />The individual stories are poignant, convincing, and compelling. I like zombie books but this was by far the best I've ever read. If you're in the mood for reading about zombies then this is the book I would recommend first. It's going on my shelves as an all-time favorite and as one I recommend to others.first. It's going on my shelves as an all-time favorite and as one I recommend to others.
B000BB1MI2|1.0|I could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's \\"performance\\" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.  The final result is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to, much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio $$$.
032147404X|5.0|This is a wonderful book for beginning and intermediate photographers who want to know the tricks of the professional photographers out there.  Although this book could be useful to those with pocket digital cameras, I believe this book is best suited to owners of DSLR Camera's. <br /> <br />The chapters of the book are as follows: <br /> <br />1. Pro tips for getting really sharp photos. <br />2. Shooting flowers like a pro. <br />3. Shooting weddings like a pro. <br />4. Shooting landscapes like a pro. <br />5. Shooting sports like a pro. <br />6. Shooting people like a pro. <br />7. Avoid problems like a pro. <br />8. Taking advantage of digital like a pro. <br />9. Taking travel & city life shots like a pro. <br />10. How to print like a pro and other cool stuff. <br />11. Photo recipes to help you get \\"The Shot\\". <br /> <br />I found the chapters to be laid out in an easy to understand format and each chapter builds your knowledge for future chapters.  This book is also small enough that I can shove it into my camera bag or backpack as reference material for those times when I just can't remember which aperature setting or lens I should be using to get \\"The Shot\\", as Scott calls it. <br /> <br />Overall, I can't see anyone except for professional or advanced photographers being disappointed with this book.  At $15-20 for the book you really can't go wrong.
B000GY729M|5.0|There are enough reviews already covering all the viewpoints out there about this album. I, for one, think it is absolutely amazing. What I want to discuss is the Best Buy Bonus CD. I think the 2nd track on this bonus disc, \\"Daddy's Eyes\\", is unbelievable and would have been one of the best songs on the album. Those of you who have heard it please comment about it. I want to see what you think.
1596912367|5.0|Restless is the story of a mother who has concealed her true identity from her daughter.  Chapters alternate between WWII and contemporary Oxford.  The characters are complex and the settings detailed and evocative.  I loved this book and read it in one sitting--I wish it had been longer.  I love William Boyd's novels--he has a historically detailed imagination and knows how to tell a story.
B00005JO20|5.0|I  am going  to tell you about King King or K-K.  The main character is Jack.  It takes place in a cave and in the past.  I liked the movie.  I liked it because it had fighting.  I also liked it becasue it has a big gorilla and because it had shooting.  If you like animals you would like this movie.  I give this movie a thumbs up!
B000EHSVQ4|4.0|\\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is about the story of Balian (Orlando Bloom) going to Jerusalem in an attempt to find forgiveness for himself and his wife who has committed suicide. That much is revealed early on, the rest of the movie is about the moral choices he makes to save the people and city of Jerusalem from idiot religious zealots within, and the Muslim army running out of reasons NOT to break the peace. It's a pretty long movie, so if you like epics then you should be pleased with this. There are also plently of bloody battle scenes if that's your thing, and the movie is pretty void of any comedic moments or characters. So basically, if you want a serious, fairly historically accurate film with lots of fight to death scenes and moral dilemmas then this is a movie worth checking out.

0609610570|2.0|Funny that a book about execution doesn't get it accomplish. The authors have a lot of experience and I am sure are good at leading and executing. However, the book does not get to the point. The authors ramble about their managing experience and almost 300 pages to transmit few ideas.
0307346609|5.0|This is my first ever Zombie book. I've seen the George Romero movies, and had serious nightmares about \\"Bub\\" coming to get me back in the 80s.<br /><br />This book is just simply awesome. It's totally entertaining. Brooks interviews survivors from all over the world. It's actually quite creative of him to have his characters explaining what happened in the Zombie outbreak in the part of the world, whether it's Yonkers, Israel, China, Japan, the U.S. Midwest, Cuba or North Korea.<br /><br />I enjoyed hearing the Zombies referred to by many names according to whom was reporting. My favorite was the name \\"Zach\\" given to them by the military in NY. It was reminiscent of what they called the North Vietnamese back in the 60s & 70s, \\"Charlie\\".<br /><br />He is extremely intelligent in regards to the many particular cultures & their mores throughout the world.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B000DN6ZGC|5.0|I first heard of Corinne Bailey Rae on SNL last week, I just happened to change the channel just as she was beginning her song.  I immediatley fell in love with her style of music. The very next day I ran out to buy the CD.  She will for sure be collecting Grammy's.
6305807930|4.0|This is one Argento film that you have to see several times.  When I got into Argento, this film was almost impossible to find (especially in its uncut version), and even when the DVD came out, I couldn't find it anywhere for rent.  So I bought it, and I've watched it twice.  The 2nd time, it really hits you.  It's a completely surreal, image driven film.  If you try to make sense of it, it won't work.  The imagery is everything, and it's outstanding.  There's not one frivolous frame in the entire film.  It's fantastic to look at.  It's not Argento's best work, but it is certainly one of his most fascinating films.  The soundtrack by Keith Emerson works very well too (I'm a massive ELP fan).  The performances are adequate, but that's not really important here.  It's a shame Argento hasn't made a decent film since 1987.  He really has some talent....
B000002GKT|4.0|How many albums cause the hair on your arms and neck stand up?  Crank this up and if you are a fan of hard bluesy rock you'll know what I'm talking about.  As a kid raised on Bluegrass, my first dose of  <br />Lynard Skynard produced a similiar reaction. Rock a man!
0307237699|5.0|In a world where people struggle mentaly battered by all sorts information, problems, and pressure it is rare to expect true hope from a politician. Barak Obama eloquently delivers that hope in this book.Most of us want him to do more than write a book. We HOPE he would be our next Commander-in-chief.
B000F3TBIO|5.0|Am trying to work out how to describe this record but I can't think of anything better than a genre based around how the soundtrack would be on a quality porn movie, not that I'd know, but it's sort of like a very slick, sexy grindy sound which is really seductive.  Might sound silly but what he has acheived is a loungey sort of feel, with a very sexy sort of sound - lots of huge bass and beat noises and so on.  Definitely not the sort of thing radio will flock to, but not a revisiting of the rock or heavier stuff he's done with FNM or Tomahawk etc... <br /> <br />What I like about it is he is making a lot of experimental sounds (and he does a lot of the music himself - proving his musical talent aside from being a majestic vocalist) but at the same time making enjpoyable well balanced songs.  Which is fairly rare to really push a boundary but not overstep it in parts - ala Mr. Bungle. <br /> <br />A lot of great music on it - 'Mojo' for me really shines as it's accessible - a little bit like a couple of the FNM songs, but only structurally and is blessed with Mike at his vocal best, is powerful and well done.  It's probably the best example of the record but there is a lot of stuff good also.  It's also not song after song of the same stuff - he's all over the place with sound but it holds together really well from track to track. <br /> <br />Similar to an underground record a few years back which Sigue Sigue Sputnik boss Tony James was promoting and played on called 'Fin de Seicle' which wasn't as heavy as Peeping Tom but had a really sexy feel to it. <br /> <br />Terrific listen
0679720200|4.0|This book is rather strange. There is a very distinct writing style, and Camus paints a very vivid picture of everything that is going on.<br /><br />The plot itself is at first completely bewildering. The book starts out with the death of our main character's mother, and then moves with startling speed to completely different things, and before you even realize what's happening, there's a baffling trial.<br /><br />The thing that troubled me most about the story was the trial itself, because knowing how silly the arguments are, one can get extremely frustrated, and I found myself quite angry at the book.<br /><br />It was the ending that I truly enjoyed. It was a very solid, satisfying ending, making the overall reflections easier. This is certainly a good book; not perfect, not incredible, and, in fact, often very confusing. Overall, though, it's an interesting book to read, and when I was done, I found myself thinking about all sorts of things, because the book really does make you think. It's not perfect, no, but it is thought-provoking. And while some people cannot stand it, others love it dearly. It's a book worth reading.
0975991477|5.0|After 20 years of researching a variety of potentially transformative subjects and theories, I believe this is the most hopeful and significant material I've yet encountered.  I'm especially excited about what this could mean for society. <br /> <br />The connection between personal wellbeing and societal wellbeing is clear, and therefore this material's relevance to human evolution is greater than even the revolutionary models of reality described by quantum physics.  Actually, like most great advancements, it incorporates and builds upon many such related discoveries that preceded it. <br /> <br />In the societal context, Lipton's work implies that current concerns like war, climate change, and peak oil are merely symptoms of a far more basic condition native to the individual and which he identifies.  This high degree of applicability gives it the rare potential to be truly world-changing. <br /> <br />Although its message isn't especially novel among enlightened philosophies (the timeless, interconnected nature of self, wherein thought literally creates reality), the modality it describes is, not to mention the obvious benefit of scientifically demonstrating how the process actually works in people and thus how it might be manipulated for personal growth, which is a first in the many attempts to quantify this idea (including quantum physics!). <br /> <br />More on the how-to techniques can be found in complimentary research called Psych-K being done by an associate of Lipton's, Rob Williams.  In fact, the two are strongest when taken together. <br /> <br />Although I'm not saying Lipton (or Williams) is a messiah, I do believe his work could turn out to be the much-anticipated trigger that will inspire a cascade of spiritual awakening among a sufficiently wide population to successfully inaugurate the next stage in our evolution (before we destroy ourselves, that is).  It will certainly contribute to that effect.  I consider it a large part of a rapidly buildingcrescendo in our understanding of ourselves. <br /> <br />It's clear that modern civilization is in a sink-or-swim race against the clock--on many fronts, rapidly converging--and if we don't redefine ourselves soon we're going to lose that race.  Cultural institutions like government and big business will fight to the death to preserve their outdated and increasingly dangerous practices, since those feed the environment that created and sustains them. <br /> <br />That institutional intransigence--our collective thinking based on how we see ourselves, a la Lipton--is the major cause of these threats to our survival.  And since our institutions are just collective expressions of ourselves, it's up to the individual to transform our culture(s).  That's only logical, since we all know the maxim about change beginning at home. <br /> <br />So far, I see no better, more naturally appealing vision of what we can be--and how to make it happen--than Lipton's.  He's translated a long-respected philosophy into something we can actually incorporate into our lives.  Both his and Williams' information have come on scene at just the right time (or just in the nick of time), but that also means that the time for change is now.  Thankfully, you can't help but be transformed by this material, and Lipton's is the natural starting point.
068987474X|4.0|My nephew is 21, a college senior, and last week his mother yelled at him because he keeps getting a certain ringtone on his cellphone.  She yelled because that ringtone is reserved for the girls he no longer wants to see, but who keep calling him constantly anyway.  His mom yelled because she thought he should be honest with them, but he \\"just can't be that mean\\" to them.  He prefers to tell them (the few times he answers) that he's \\"too busy\\" and then he never calls them again.  And you know what?  Very few of them take the hint - they continue to pursue him fruitlessly.  They need this book -- STAT.  If you keep calling, texting and emailing a guy and he never answers or is \\"too busy,\\" he's not really busy or scared or too shy or confused about his feelings - he's just not that into you.  Believe me, Behrendt is onto something.  When my nephew wants to date a girl, nothing stops him from seeing her.  It's that simple.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|Tridd says that 2 retailers (Best Buy and Walmart) will be the only ones selling the 3 disc version but this Amazon page clearly states that the set has 3 discs. So, is the one Amazon is selling a bonus set? According to an official KISS website, Walmart will include the Largo 77 show, Best Buy will include the 1st night from Detroit 76 (3rd night is already part of Kissology set) and all other stores will have NYC 77, so I'd like to know if Amazon is one of the \\"all other stores\\" or if what is posted on Amazon's website is a misprint. <br /> <br />Regardless, I've already pre-ordered mine, and if I have to I will buy 3 sets to get the 3 bonus discs.
B000HCO8IQ|4.0|After making both one of the most hailed and one of the most controversial albums of 2004, Scissor Sisters had to find a new path for their much anticipated sophomore album TA-DAH. You have to feel some sympathy for the quirky band considering how do you supercede or surpass a gay concept album the quality of SCISSOR SISTERS.  Sure TA-DAH once again affirms the sexuality of the majority of the band through glamorous pop things, but it is nowhere near the level of SCISSOR SISTERS.  With that said, TA-DAH is consistent and nearly as good as SCISSOR SISTERS, though it isn't as exciting.  Here you don't have the \\"gay-concept\\" think as heavily as ingrained as the debut and the listener must rely on the pop, dance, electronic arrangements more as opposed to the lyrics such as \\"t*ts on the radio\\" or \\"I left My heart in San Francisco/ at a motherf**king disco\\".  While there may be no hit the size of \\"Take Your Mam\\", the Sisters have definitely still got it, if not to the same exciting level as they did before.<br /><br />The album starts off strong with the Elton John co-penned \\"Don't Feel Like Dancing\\", which would've sounded equally at home in the 1970s on a Bee Gees album.  It features great songwriting and immaculate falsetto by none other than the band's quirk, flamboyant, STUNNING, frontman Jake Shears.  The album continues to look upward with the consistent, though not as catchy or infectious second track \\"She's My Man\\".  What is interesting and unique about \\"She's My Man\\" is the fact that the chord changes aren't incredibly predictable and the switch of tonal center (keys) makes for an even more intriguing listen.  it is quirky, but it is quirky in good ways.<br /><br />\\"I Can't Decide\\" is track of brevity, but it is one of the very strongest on the album with the exception of \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancing\\".  The track feels incredibly like a \\"cabaret\\" performance, yet the novelty-dance feel here is incredibly potent. \\"Intermission\\" later on will feature that same \\"cabaret\\" feel, but it doesn't quite come over as potent as \\"I Can't Decide\\".<br /><br />\\"Lights\\" has nice funk-soul production with a bumping-beefy bass line with Shears's Bee Gee reminiscent falsetto sitting on top.  However, the track isn't as alluring as one would hope it to be, but it is above par if nothing else.  It is \\"Land Of A Thousand Words\\", this album's \\"Mary\\" (my favorite track from SCISSOR SISTERS), that is one of the show stealers. There is an obvious slackening of pace along with beautiful orchestration and vocal work here. It is simply amazing.<br /><br />After the \\"take it for what it is worth\\" \\"Intermission\\", The Sisters return strong with \\"Kiss You Off\\", which isn't quite as strong as say \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancing\\" or \\"I Can't Decide\\", but is strong enough to be better than most of the tracks on TA-DAH!.  After \\"Kiss You Off\\" things begin to die and feel like filler as opposed to hits.  However, even on the Scissors debut, the end of the album was dull with the very best at the forefront.  With this album being no different in this regard, you can't help but to see that SCISSOR SISTERS simply had more obvious hits while TA-DAH doesn't quite make the cut.  That isn't to say it doesn't have strong tracks, but not with the exception of the few mentioned trump any of their previous material.<br /><br />Still, Scissors are one of my favorite new bands and it is ashamed they can't be embraced more.  However, in my eyes, this album receives 3.5 stars.\\"cabaret\\" feel, but it doesn't quite come over as potent as \\"I Can't Decide\\". <br /> <br />\\"Lights\\" has nice funk-soul production with a bumping-beefy bass line with Shears's Bee Gee reminiscent falsetto sitting on top.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|firefly <br /> <br /> <br />I stumbled upon this series purely by accident, and it was one of the happiest mistakes of my life. I mis-remembered the recommendation of a friend and ordered the Firelfy DVD set along with the movie, Serenity (not to be confused with the first part of the first DVD, also called Serenity. That two hour segment was originally created to be the series pilot, although it wasn't aired that way.) <br /> <br />What a surprise! At first, the premise seemed pretty silly, cowboys in space and all that. The thing is, the show is so well written, so well acted, and so well shot, that by 10 minutes into the first episode (part one of Serenity, the two hour pilot), I was hooked. I consider it the freshest, most original, interesting and well done TV series I have seen to date. <br /> <br />Okay, we have two war veterans, Malcolm and Zoe, trying to get out from under the heavy, oppressive society of the \\"Alliance.\\" They buy an old spaceship (Firefly class) and gather an interesting ensemble cast for the crew. What happens from there is a series of misadventures as they try to make a usually dishonest living among the outer, less \\"civilized\\" planets, while trying to stay one step ahead of the facist Alliance. They meet and deal with all manner of strange situations, wild and crazy people, in space, all the while cracking wise, shooting straight, and saving the day (well, mostly.........in their own kind of awkward, very human, way). Amazingly, the odd mix of the old west, space travel, high tech mixed with low, as well as a Blade Runner-ish mix of Chinese and American culture really works. It shouldn't, but it does, and it quickly begins to feel very real and very comfortable. <br /> <br />As a fan of Babylon 5, Stargate, Star Trek, Doctor Who, and Farscape, I think that Firefly easily stands its ground as one of the best TV series ever made, Sci-fi or otherwise. (No wonder it was cancelled.) From the first few minutes of the first episode, you can feel the chemistry. It is compelling. I watch it over and over, and have lost count of the number of times I have seen it. (and, yes, I can sing the theme song..........next step is getting out the guitar and learning to play it.) <br /> <br />Be sure to get the feature film, Serenity, when you get the Firefly series, it caps the story and ties up a few of the many loose ends. (Of which, there were many, which would have led to many years of wonderful stories with great writing and great cast, and coincidentally, large advertising revenues and happy fans. Made perfect sense to cancel it. A completely sane decision. Really.) <br /> <br />The innovations and unique features are far too many to mention. I heartily encourage you to buy both Firefly and Serenity and enjoy some really great, highly entertaining story telling. If you're not sure, then rent it first and then buy it. There is a lot to love about it. Shiny.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|I'll be honest the first time or two I listened to this CD, I didn't care for it too much outside of a couple of tracks, namely the single \\"Call me When You're Sober\\" and a couple others that I don't remember. I think because of their previous album \\"Fallen\\" I was thinking there were going to be some catchy tunes and such. There isn't. I think this is why this album grew on me.<br /><br />This is a much better album than \\"Fallen\\" in my personal opinion after multiple listenings. Like I said, there is no catchy tunes here like \\"Bring me to Life\\" or \\"My Immortal\\" but there are some great songs here. I would have to say I pretty much like every track on here.<br /><br />Now, back to their fist album. The reason I didn't care for this one was because they had a couple of great songs but they had a crapload of filler. I would say there were three songs on that album that were great and the rest of it I could do without which is why several times when listening to it, I tend to eject before the end of the CD or maybe to the last track because I do like that one.<br /><br />Anyways, my point is that \\"The Open Door\\" is a good album throughout with not much filler. There isn't a standout here but I think in this case it is good because most of the songs are good. I would say if there was a standout on the album it is the final track \\"Good Enough\\" which is in my opinion, Amy's best ballad to date. This song has great piano and her lyrics and songwriting is great here. Also, probably the other reason why I dig this one over the other tracks is that to me it sounds very similar to a Fiona Apple song and I'm a HUGE Fiona Apple fan, but I think Amy pulls it off.<br /><br />To conclude, I definitely reccomend this CD to all people who are fans of Evanescence's first disc but I think this album has the potential to open up more of a fanbase because it is much more consistent than \\"Fallen\\".
B000EHSVS2|5.0|Not only is this arguably the best docudrama ever made, it is damn fun to watch, as George C. Scott brings the legendery Commander of the European Theater of Operations to life in a mesmerizing performance.  In fact, I think it is pretty hard to imagine Patton without Scott's bearing, as he quickly became synonymous with the role, even though he turned down the Oscar at the 1970 Academy Awards.<br /><br />The film doesn't so much chart Patton's life as it does make him a captivating symbol of American hubris.  Old Blood and Guts is considered by many to be America's greatest war hero, and Schaffner puts Patton on a grand stage.  We see Patton at his most combative, his powerful oratory skills which in many ways voiced American foreign policy, even as political leaders soft pedaled it.  While the movie is definitely not a political tract, it has these undercurrents and is well worth watching again, especially in a time when we see so much bluster and harsh rhetoric coming out of the White House.<br /><br />The DVD package may not meet some persons high definition standards, but the movie has been digital enhanced and there are plenty of extras.  You won't be disappointed.
B00005NKKV|4.0|Sound of Silence is Simon & Garfunkle's 2nd album, but the first of four great ones! Sound of Silence, the albums title track, is contained here in its original format (Paul Simon remixed this track for the Mrs. Robinson Soundtrack) and is possibly one the duos best songs. The album it self lacks the strong song writing that would shine through on the next three albums, but it is filled with plenty of gems. The Leaves that are Green (also the original mix), Kathy's Song and April She Will Come are all worth buying this album.
B00005JPAM|5.0|Monarchs have always faced threats to their thrones. So much so that royal history, burgeoning with fiendish conspiracies, violent plots, and gruesome assassinations, sometimes reads like a slasher novel. A few recent films have fully exploited this theme. 1998's \\"Elizabeth\\", starring the should-have-won-an-Oscar-for-this-role Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth I, revolved around an assassination attempt that included the queen's lover. On a less violent theme, Judy Dench, in \\"Mrs. Brown\\", depicted Queen Victoria's \\"trist\\" with a Highlander that had all of England alight with scandal. Has a new \\"threatened queen\\" genre emerged? Apparently so. Enter a rare film about a living monarch who finds her crown imperiled in an astonishingly novel way. For once Her Majesty can watch the drama she lived reemerge in celluloid - not that she probably wants to. Though the film sports a prosaic title, \\"The Queen\\", it boldly explores uncharted territory. Here the Queen, reigning in the late twentieth century hinterland between monarchy and non-monarchy, finds herself attacked by her own people. And she, much like the great-great-grandmother she shares with her husband, was not amused.<br /><br />The film opens as Queen Elizabeth II sits for a regal portrait. Her world unfolds as the royal portraiteer dotes on his imperial subject. Then, in a \\"we're not in Kansas anymore\\" flash, the newly elected Tony Blair explodes onto the screen. The now ex-Prime Minister receives voluminous coverage for a movie entited \\"The Queen.\\" One memorable early scene shows Blair bowing on one knee as the Queen inquires as to his desire to serve the nation. He answers \\"yes.\\" That probably didn't give too much away. Both figures, Sovereign and Prime Minister, share the spotlight and their disparate worlds collide after catastrophe strikes.<br /><br />News of Princess Diana's death soars over England. Actual news footage, now almost ten years old, gets woven with dramatization. The late Princess appears often. Tony Blair issues a eulogy almost immediately. But the royal family remains eerily silent, holed up in Balmoral, their Scottish getaway. The Duke of Edinburgh, depicted here as rather heartless and crass, shows more concern for hunting stags than the furor around the dead Princess. He even takes Diana's sons hunting as a diversion. Prince Charles, divorced for a year from Diana, remains the only one moved. He flies to France to bring the body of his ex-wife back to England. As the tension rises the film depicts him as nervous, fidgety, and fearing assassination. Regardless, he cannot alter his mother's public stoicism towards the tragedy. The Queen Mother provides some comic relief. When someone shows concern over photographers intruding on their son's hunt, she says nonchalantly, \\"if there's a photographer he could be the first kill of the day.\\"<br /><br />Soon bundles of flowers and messages of grief crowd the gate of Buckingham Palace. But no one's home. The flag, supporting royal traditon, remains lowered in the Queen's absence. Icy silence from the palace sours the public. They begin speaking out against the monarchy. This causes a drastic change in Tony Blair. He suddenly sees the interdependence of the Queen with his own station. In phone call after phone call he pleads with her to do something. She resists even after he gives her a vital statistic: one in four people now favor abolishing the monarchy. Que the Threatened Queen leitmotif. Princess Diana now seems to upstage the royal family even in death. Elizabeth II convinces herself that \\"this mood\\" will pass.<br /><br />It doesn't. Slowly the idea that her people hate her sinks in. Bowing to pressure, the family inspects the bundles of grief displayed outside of Balmoral. They soon return to London and face the dense Buckingham crowds. Here the Queen sees what her public indifference has wrought. She reads \\"They don't deserve you\\" and \\"They have your blood on their hands\\" on some of the flowers. Here begins the Queen's transformation, criss-crossing with the Prime Minister's. Diana's death irreversably changes them both. Finally, probably more in deference to her public than to the dead Princess, the Queen finally issues a public statement.

0451169514|5.0|When I first read this book, upon finishing it I immediately proceeded to rip it's 1000 pages up into several tens of thousands of little pieces. That was how much the story affected me. It disgusted me, it disturbed me, it ... moved me. After brooding about it for a few weeks it occurred to me that any writer that could move me to do something like that has really messed with my head, and if that's not the mark of a great writer I don't know what is. I then had to go out and buy another copy and read it again.<br /><br />Amid all the horror that Stephen King has unleashed from the darkness of his imagination, this has to be the most disturbing, disgusting and, at times, offensive work he has ever set to paper. Forget the movie... this is high octane writing which will leave you gasping for breath. With this book and \\"The Tommyknockers,\\" Stephen King has proven that he is not just a great horror story writer, but a GREAT writer... period. Buy it, read it.
0743298020|4.0|This book was recommended by Amazon since I had read all the Dan Brown books (DaVinci Code, etc.)I figured I would give it a shot. <br /> <br />The story is easy enough to read in the beginning. However, later chapters confuse the reader because both stories are being told in present 1st person text. There are times when I started a chapter and the author referred to \\"I\\". Several times I had to read a few back pages to find out how the story was being picked up. <br /> <br />Basically, you have an author who has been asked to complete the biography of another author. The main character refers to herself as \\"I\\" as would be natural. However, when the second author is telling the tale to the biographer, she also uses the \\"I\\" during her historical accounts. I'm sure this was done on purpose to illustrate that, while the women are completely different, they share issues that run much deeper than conversation. <br /> <br />Setterfield has written a very tight book about an intriguing cast of characters. No one is running for president or trying to take over the word in this novel and the simplicity is very appropriate to this tale. <br /> <br />I'll wait and see what the topic is if she writes again. If it intrigues me I would have no hesitation to pick it up and enjoy the tale. I guess my hope is that the author's world broadens enough for her to present a more visionary tale.

B00001U0E1|5.0|This is, in my view, a funny, well-acted look at what might have happened to Will Shakespeare if women were to act in his plays way back in the day...one of them might have looked like Gwyneth Paltrow, and they might have fallen for each other. Perhaps one has to be open to Shakespeare, interested in acting, attracted to the England of 400 years ago, and have a patient ear for archaic English dialogue to really love it. If that describes you, don't miss this one.
B000BONX1S|4.0|My daughter got this doll for her first Christmas when she was [...]  She is [...] now and still sleeps with \\"baby\\" every night.  All 3 of my nieces also have this doll and loved it as well.  It's a nice size, slightly smaller than most, and has a soft body.  My daughter doesn't like to have clothes on her dolls, so my complaint is that the soft body is (was) white.  It's filthy.  I have machine washed it 2X, though I don't recommend.  It's hard to get completely dry, and the material at the connections has weakened and has had to be sewn.  The body shape has turned into a \\"pear,\\" but my daughter doesn't seem to mind.  The good baby powder smell is still there.  Worth the cost.

B00005O438|3.0|My grandma told me how scary she found the movie about 20 years ago, when my mom brought it home and said they should watch it. She knew I was into horror but I couldn't find the movie in the store. I bought the book which I thought was great and very well-written, percieving the story from the eyes of each character, including the dog during his change from mild-mannered and housebroken to rabid and terrifying.<br /><br />Well, the movie was a rather large letdown. The movie itself is a great example of the old saying \\"Don't judge a book by it's cover.\\" On the cover is a very sinister looking dog with blood red eyes. The dog in the movie doesn't look like that at all. The dog looks just messy and wet, with bloodstained fur and foaming at the mouth. It's not really as scary as it may sound (except when the dog jumps at the window. That freaked me out a little bit). The blood effects were pretty good but the mess with the affair wasn't as well done as in the book. The ending was perhaps the biggest disappointment, though, because it doesn't have the shocker the book did.<br /><br />Final Word: Decent, but definitely could've been better. If you liked this, check out the book as well as other Stephen King movie adaptations, especially Carrie and Misery.<br /><br />** 2.5 stars out of 5 **

0743487486|5.0|For me, the book started in the middle since I'm already aware of the damage of the traditional parenting style in our society.  I understand why he wrote what he did in the first part of the book, though, since a lot of it is news to a great deal of people. <br /> <br />What I loved the most about his book is the issue of respect.  He emphasized that a great deal, which I feel is the cornerstone of healthy parenting.  I also really enjoyed that it was conversational in tone rather than a drab, textbook style tone.  A lot of what he says is truly common sense, which is what I see is the irony of it all.  We all know how to unconditionally love, but a lot of us have been conditioned by our society to parent in a certain way.  Having to have a book like this in our society shows that a good deal of parents need to be washed clean of their conditioning, so their true loving selves shine through.

0061139378|5.0|Ah, the English. Known for Toffee, the Beatles, and one of the rare modern-day monarchys, they are also known for another thing:Scaring the bejeeze out of small children. <br />    It started with Grim's Fairy Tales, and is kept up by folks like Roald Dahl and now, Mr. Gaiman. This book is creepy. REALLY creepy. I have always enjoyed horror in my movies and my books since I was really small. However, I can sincerely say that, had I read this at any age under 16, I would STILL be afraid of the dark. Some of the imagery in this book is so good that it just sticks in your head and shows up at strange moments (3AM when the heater comes on, for example).  <br />     Mind you, it's a GREAT book. Just don't let anyone (child or otherwise) read this who is even a bit skittish.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Though this maybe a Christmas-ssy, Holiday album, dont expect a Jingle Bells or such on this CD. <br />This is indeed a \\"VERY\\" Sarah cd. <br />refelected in the choice of the songs and the treatment. Very mellow and bittersweet. <br />So if thats ur thing (probably is if u into Sarah's work), dont look further and go for this CD. <br />My favourites gotta Happy Xmas (war is over), River and the best of all..the new Sarah song, \\"wintersong\\". Its a loveley sentiment and a simple yet amazingly beautiful song. <br />Among the traditional stuff that she has covered, \\"The first Noel/Mary Mary\\", had my jaw scraping the floor. Its a very unexpected treatemnt she has given it.Only wish she had taken more such bold chances with the other tracks too..but all in all...great CD...now just waiting for a brand new original material cd and a tour! <br />:-)
B000FTWB7G|5.0|This is the best album of the year hands DOWN! This album allows you to go on Amy's odyssey through all of her struggles. And pain this is one of the most emotionial albums I ever heard in my life. This is better then Fallen noone wants to admit that. But it is the new producers she has is even better then Ben Moody. Amy brings so much passion and emotion to her music. Like you is probably the saddest song on the CD. I can relate because I had someone pass away this year. This album I urge you to buy. You wont be disappointed. Hope to see more from Evanescence. This is truly amazing and beautiful music. Thank you AMY!
B00007FOMP|5.0|This is considered the first concept album ever released by Motown, but it did not come out of the blue. Other producers had tried before Gaye: Holland-Dozier-Holland attempted to create a sort of \\"love concerto\\" in The Supremes's \\"I Hear a Symphony\\"; Norman Whitfield began to experiment with the idea in The Temptations' \\"Cloud Nine\\", and Frank Wilson almost made it a year before Gaye with the Four Tops' \\"Still Waters Run Deep\\", and he even tried to reproduce the soundtrack of a musical with \\"Diana Ross & The Supremes Join The Temptations\\", with \\"overture\\" (a terrific version of Gaye's hit \\"Try It, Baby\\"), and grand finale included. Marvin Gaye not only came with the stronger album from a thematic point of view (war, drugs, poverty, unemployment, racism, religious faith, ecology, politics), but also because of its urban-drama feel, --later found in Stevie Wonder's \\"Innervisions\\"--, and its lyrical proto-funk musical treatment. For the first time the session musicians known as The Funk Brothers, and the resident backing vocalists The Andantes were given credit on a Motown album, and Gaye had full control of his production. A great album that conveys one of the most intense moments of the United States cultural life.
B00000DOZB|4.0|Following on the heels of an album many attribute to the collapse of progressive rock ('Tales from Topographic Oceans' in 1973), Yes sought to heal the gap it had driven between its fans--some loved 'Tales,' and others thought it was bombastic and (a classic pun) over the edge.  Critics saw 'Tales' as an opportunity to do something they had been waiting to do forever: demonstrate to the mere common man their birthright superiority by collectively dashing the whole of progressive rock into oblivion. <br /> <br />They successfully destroyed the further exploration and cultivation of the art form, but not the spirit of its followers.  It was in this climate, though, that Yes's 1974 release, 'Relayer,' was somewhat ignored and shunned.  The band did not succeed outright in reuniting its fans (three years later, the release of 'Going for the One' came much closer to this ideal) with 'Relayer,' but they did set down a truly progressive album, ripe with fresh ideas and a totally new direction for the band. <br /> <br />This new direction was fostered somewhat by the recent lineup changes (the exodus of drummer Bill Bruford after 'Close to the Edge' and keyboardist Rick Wakeman's departure after 'Tales').  Drummer Alan White was called in for 'Tales,' and to fill Wakeman's shoes, Swiss-born keyboardist Patrick Moraz was commissioned well into the 'Relayer' project.  White, now a seasoned member of the band, gained the confidence to give his best performance on 'Relayer.'  And Moraz, a fresh addition, offered a completely different playing style than Wakeman.  While Wakeman was steeped in classical, Moraz was much more influenced by jazz. <br /> <br />Now that I have given the facts, it's time for the evaluation segment.  I must respectfully disagree with many of the reviewers of this album in that I personally do not like Patrick Moraz's work.  Considering the matter at length, I find the parts about the album I consistently dislike are the keyboard lines.  The synthesizerprogramming is universally awful; most of the time it sounds like helium escaping from a balloon.  Also, Moraz uses almost all synthesizers, the Mellotron is often swallowed in the mix, and the Hammond organ is almost nonexistent.  The latter two are things I miss from the band's earlier albums; even Tony Kaye on the very early albums was proficient in the usage of the Hammond organ.  The Hammond, I believe, was integral to the band's sound.  And Rick Wakeman's classical sensibilities kept his contributions within the bounds of reason, whereas Moraz's work is rather grating and irritating.  Finally, Wakeman's synthesizer programming--though sometimes staid--had a warm and organic feel to it, something which I sorely miss on 'Relayer.'  While it is true that this album is indeed one of noticibly less absolute structure than the previous efforts, and while certainly its sound is rougher and harder, I think some sort of solid base was needed, and the keyboards would have been where I would have placed it. <br /> <br />As far as Alan White, I agree with most people (including Bill Bruford himself): He just doesn't quite measure up to Bruford, though he is very good.  Of course some of that may well be the somewhat flat production of this album (which was recorded in some sort of mobile studio), but it seems as though the life and breath the drumming had when Bruford was at the sticks has vanished in favor of a more \\"backseat\\" style of drumming.  The remarkable thing about Yes is that, on the three albums from 1971 ('The Yes Album') to 1972 ('Fragile' and 'Close to the Edge'), no member of the band ever served simply as background.  Most bands subjugate the rhythm section to a mere continuo, but not Yes.  Each member of the band stood out at some point or other in the music.  White, for all his efforts, sort of fades into the background in a way that Bill Bruford never did. <br /> <br />The remaining members of the band perform brilliantly as ever.  Jon Anderson's vocalsare truly first-rate, Steve Howe gives what is perhaps his most daring technical performance all throughout the album, and Chris Squire's trademark Rickenbacker--muted a little in this album--is present as ever.  Overall the musicianship of the band is sterling, perhaps better than at any point or lineup in the band's existence.  I will never dispute that 'Relayer' is the most technically-advanced Yes album, and I will venture to argue that it is the most technically-advanced album in all of music. <br /> <br />But technical skill, dazzling as it may be, is not everything in music.  <br /> <br />As far as the album itself, I wouldn't proclaim as some have that it is Yes's greatest achievement.  On the whole, it's somewhat less musical than most Yes music and a great deal denser and harder to appreciate.  It's also somewhat darker lyrically than the generally sunny material put out by the band in the past.  The first track is by far the best, and the next two just don't strike me as anywhere near as brilliant as some people find them.  In fact, I find the second track nearly unlistenable, especially the frenzied \\"Cha cha cha!\\" part near the end.  It is for the comparatively lacking status of these two tracks, along with the awful keyboards, that I only give the release four stars.  There is brilliant material on 'Relayer,' but I believe some of it could have been presented and developed much better. <br /> <br />For the most part, the entire album is a clear departure from the earlier releases.  It does not entirely lack structure as some people might at first believe; rather, the structure of each track is held together much more loosely then in the conventional sense and mostly by the format of the song, not the actual music itself.  This will take some acclimation, and all through this album one perceives the opposing forces of greatness and insanity battling it out, each with the ultimate goal of prevailing.  Throughout, a tenuous balance between the two is upheld. <br /> <br />I will now comment exclusively upon the first track, \\"The Gates of Delirium.\\" <br /> <br />This song will take a great deal of listening in order to appreciate.  Most people who first listen to it will find themselves wishing it to be over around about the ten-minute mark.  Of all the Yes I have sampled (everything from the debut up through this album, and then some of their later material), \\"Gates\\" by far took me the longest time to like.  And, unlike any other Yes song I have ever heard, I utterly hated \\"Gates\\" the first three or four times I tried it.  It is the wildest, most cacophonic piece of music ever recorded, I venture to say. <br /> <br />So why did I keep listening to it?  Well, I did spend a decent amount of money on the album, and if I had just left it on the rack collecting dust, all I would have had to show for it would have been perhaps one of the prettiest album covers Roger Dean ever produced.  Also, I refused to believe something that appealed so little to me could possibly have generated so much acclaim among progressive rock fans.  Obviously the music was very difficult to get into, and I decided to confront the challenge with repeated listening. <br /> <br />I won, so to speak, because I have discovered the magic of this track.  The comparison that is made most often is between \\"The Gates of Delirium\\" and \\"Close to the Edge.\\"  My opinion on the matter has changed with repeated listening to both, and I must now submit that I honestly cannot decide which of these phenominal epics is better.  I suppose it depends upon the day on which you ask the question, so for all practical purposes, to me it's a tie. <br /> <br />\\"Gates\\" carries the listener through one of the most engrossing musical journeys ever composed.  The basic story is that of a war, and then the silence which follows the fighting.  The story is told through both the words and the music, which is a trademark facet of Yes music since 'Close to the Edge.'  The ending sequence, excised as the single \\"Soon,\\" is breathtakingly beautiful.  It only really shines with all its might when absorbed just after the brain-shattering cacophony of the \\"War of the Instrumentalists\\" that comes just before it in the music.  After that intensity, one feels as though he had actually been part of the battle, and now that it's over, the sun is shining down in vivid shafts through the clouds.  And, up in the sky, the gates of Heaven are opening and spreading eternal warmth and beauty over the war-torn landscape.  The delirium of war is replaced with the glimmering, soul-fulfilling advent of inner peace.  It will give you chills. <br /> <br />For the benefit of those viewing this particular item's page with intent to purchase this particular edition of the album, you should know that 'Relayer' was re-remastered in 2003 by Rhino Records.  The Rhino edition comes in a digipack with slipcover and includes bonus tracks.  The original 1990 set of Yes albums are known to have poor sound quality, so you would be much better served to get the Rhino edition. <br /> <br />All in all, this album is experiencing a revival insofar as appreciation.  And I believe it deserves it; it was underrated in the beginning, and it is now finally seeing its due.  However, I would recommend 'Relayer' to only a very select group of people.  Devoted Yes fans (or is it Yesfans) probably already have this album in one form or another, and if not, what are you waiting for?  I would definitely not start with 'Relayer' if you are new to the band or to progressive rock in general.  'The Yes Album' (1971), 'Fragile' (1972), and 'Close to the Edge' (1972) (and in that order) would be your best bet.  If you like what you hear, you will (eventually) like 'Relayer.'  Basically, this is a fans' album.  Casual listeners probably shouldn't waste their time on this one.  I'm not trying to be condescending; I'm just trying to save you some time and money.
B000HEYVOU|5.0|This is hands-down the absolute favorite book of the children in the \\"parent and me\\" class where I work.

B00005HEGB|5.0|There were two albums released by Yes in the year 1972--the stellar `Close to the Edge' and this earlier effort, `Fragile.'  Yes--at this point consisting of Jon Anderson on lead vocals, Bill Bruford on drums, Steve Howe on guitars, Chris Squire on bass, and the newly-recruited Rick Wakeman on keyboards--had just scored a decent breakthrough with their third album, `The Yes Album,' in the previous year.  They had actually broken the charts in America, and they had finally reached and fortified what would be their characteristic sound in the years and albums to come. <br /> <br />So where does `Fragile' fit into all that?  The original nine tracks on `Fragile' are widely considered quintessential progressive rock, a template from which myriad later acts would spawn.  From start to finish, `Fragile' plays like well-oiled machinery (even with its occasional catches and blips), and its main material--the longer suites, mostly--demonstrates the level of maturity the band had ultimately achieved by this time in their collective career.  Oh, and `Fragile' also brings to the table a little something called \\"Roundabout,\\" which may well be the band's most famous song ever. <br /> <br />What are we waiting for?  The songs (in detail): <br /> <br />1. \\"Roundabout\\" - Well, well.  Do I really need to comment upon this one?  Unlike many popular, therefore overplayed songs, this one just doesn't get old.  Play it as many times as you like, and it still captivates.  Right from the onset, with Steve Howe's guitar harmonics, one can hear the innovation and compositional brilliance of the band.  And as the introduction moves on into the body of the piece, an irresistible lick makes itself heard again and again, though it never grows tiresome.  The middle section of the piece, with its fantastically arranged vocals, inspires pure awe, and the soft and pensive section which follows adds a much-appreciated dynamic contrast.  The Mellotron flutes are particularly nice, though of course they only play a few poly-chords.  What follows is one of Rick Wakeman's most spectacular solo escapades (though of course the one in \\"Close to the Edge\\" is his supreme solo effort), a repetition of earlier parts of the song, and the riveting conclusion, replete in layered, overdubbed vocals and presented with minimal backing to enhance the effect.  A simple flourish by Steve Howe ends the piece in understatement.  In a word, stunning. <br /> <br />2. \\"Cans And Brahms\\" - This is Rick Wakeman's showcase song on the album (each member gets a chance to show off in solo).  It's not bad, though it's not original.  It's basically an arrangement of various Brahms melodies, played on slightly unconventional instrumentation.  The work demonstrates for all to see Wakeman's peerless technical ability, but I do wish he (or the band in care of him) would have come up with something original.  Still, though, it's short enough that it goes by before it overstays its welcome. <br /> <br />3. \\"We Have Heaven\\" - This is Jon Anderson's chance to shine.  Here, in a vivid, multilayered arrangement, he sings a bunch of nonsense, albeit in impressive fashion.  Though I respect the tremendous skill required to have laid down such a track, I personally find this work insufferably annoying and repetitive.  It did not make it onto my iPod. <br /> <br />4. \\"South Side Of The Sky\\" - Ah, here we are with the second of the epic pieces.  This one is a great deal darker and more angular than \\"Roundabout,\\" and its lyrics allegedly deal with a failed Antarctic expedition where the explorers end up dying.  Though with Yes, you can never be sure.  Even so, this song is a true masterpiece of instrumentation, beginning with a brumal blast of synthesized Antarctic wind (apparently previous editions of the album also included footsteps, which have now been moved to the end of the previous track, where I have never heard them because I can't stand to listen to the third track to completion), and--in that weirdYes-esque manner--it rocks.  The middle section is a dark, piano-dominated piece of disjointed yet substantial clockwork, culminating in a neutral vocal section which might be representative of the gates of heaven opening for the doomed explorers.  After a return to the motifs from the beginning of the song, the work ends on a fadeout into the same howling wind with which it began. <br /> <br />5. \\"Five Per Cent For Nothing\\" - It might take you longer to read this description than it would for you to listen to the song.  It's really that short--around 35 seconds or so.  Bruford's showcase, it's a little drum pattern, repeated twice, with instrumentation from the rest of the band thrown in for good measure.  I guess they figured 35 seconds is about five percent of a song, so that's how they arrived at this title.  It makes a nice little introduction to the next track, so it works. <br /> <br />6. \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" - This is the infamous pop monster that, nonetheless, maintains the progressive feel so integral to Yes.  It's pleasant to listen to, and it's one of the shorter of Yes's full-band involvement songs up to this point.  The beginning line, with Steve Howe's expert guitar work running in parallel across the stereo field, is a sound to behold.  Once Chris Squire enters the fray, things get really interesting.  This song has one of the most enduring bass lines ever conceived, even among Yes songs.  Squire is among the most innovative of bassists, and his trademark, treble-heavy tone really helps the mood of this piece.  And, of course, Jon Anderson is up in the stratosphere singing away about nothing.  But then, Yes is music where, though very pretty in their own right, the lyrics are unimportant.  Anderson's lyrics paint pictures of emotion, they don't broadcast it of their own volition.  In this he was one of music's greatest poets. <br /> <br />7. \\"The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus)\\" - Here's a shocker: All the instrumentation that isn't drums is performed by Chris Squire's bass.  What an original concept!  If only the band had expounded upon what they had discovered here, they could really have come up with some interesting material.  Even so, this is by far one of the most interesting of tracks from `Fragile.'  \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" segues into this track, so \\"The Fish\\" is akin to a separate movement of the previous track.  Oh, and yes, they do sing the words \\"Schindleria Praematurus\\" at the end of the song.  Why?  I don't know.  Obviously it's the Latin name for a fish, but as to why it was chosen to name this song, I have no clue. <br /> <br />8. \\"Mood For A Day\\" - It's Howe's turn up to bat, with this showcase song.  I never though much of \\"Clap\\" (often mislabeled \\"The Clap\\" to the horror and extreme annoyance of Steve Howe), and I suppose that holds true for this song as well.  Steve Howe is a brilliant guitarist, probably one of the two best in the history of the art, and were I myself a guitarist I might find this track wholly more interesting.  As a keyboardist, I probably listen to \\"Cans And Brahms\\" a great deal more than most `Fragile' listeners.  There's nothing wrong with \\"Mood For A Day;\\" I'm just not qualified to evaluate it objectively. <br /> <br />9. \\"Heart Of The Sunrise\\" - Ah.  Bliss.  Here we have the ultimate closer to an exemplary album.  Beginning with a bang with an intriguing instrumental jam, this theme is then explored for two-and-a-half minutes before the song begins, very softly, yet never relenting until it reaches its climax.  And what a climax it is!  Anderson sings a high D (the one just above tuning A-440) which, when immersed in a chord is nothing special, naked and at the high point of a song is nothing short of breathtaking (even though he doesn't hold it and it sounds a little forced).  Jon's voice can go much, much higher, but this particular note is so well placed that it says, commandingly, that the listener has arrived at the ultimate climax of the song. <br /> <br/>It's just too bad that this isn't really the end.  There is a return of that energetic instrumental jam, then a pregnant silence.  Then, after about six seconds or so, a reprise of that ghastly third track, \\"We Have Heaven\\" bursts out of nowhere and fades out the track.  The idea was brilliant, but since I hated the song the first time, I really wasn't particularly thrilled to hear it again, especially tacked on to one of the best songs on the album.  At least that pause is long enough to where I can just skip the ending.  I considered altering the track before putting it on my iPod (basically removing that ending section), but I couldn't bring myself to desecrate a progressive rock masterpiece in that manner, even if I don't agree with the way it was arranged. <br /> <br />Overall, I would recommend `Fragile' to just about anyone, particularly those new to Yes.  In this instance, there is nothing wrong with this release that would make it \\"for newbies.\\"  On the contrary, this album offers a vivid picture of just what made Yes the masterful progressive rock band it was, in a manner that is akin to on-the-job training.  This album was made to make music, not to indoctrinate or placate fans.  That, in part, is what makes Yes so special: They made music first, and radio-friendly music only if it turned out that way. <br /> <br />Thank God for `Fragile,' or there might never have been a `Close to the Edge.'
B0000CGV00|5.0|Helene Grimaud is somewhat of an enigma and also a maverick. For one thing she loves wolves and helps sponsor a wolf sanctuary. Also she is exceptionally attractive and has a very strong personality which comes through even in recorded performances. But Helene Grimaud is also a very good pianist for whom artistry is as important as technigue, and she has an abundance of both. Buy any performance by Grimaud and you will probably be very favorably impressed by it even if it differs in subtle ways from performances by other pianists. I purchased this CD primarily to hear Grimaud's performance of Beethoven's Fantasy for Piano, Chorus, and Orchestra (often called simply the Choral Fastasy) -- an unusual, but very impressive, work which I love and which served as a precursor for the finale of Beethoven's 9th Symphony. As I expected Grimaud gives a very satisfactory performance of this work as well as of Beethoven's Tempest Sonata. Since I am not a fan of 20th century music, I can't comment knowledgably on the other two works on this CD. You may find them quite impressive, but even if you don't Grimaud's performances of the two works by Beethoven (especially the Choral Fantasy) are worth the quite reasonable purchase price. Incidentally, Amazon also offers this collection, entitled Credo, in a hybrid CD which will play on regular CD players but give even better sound if you are fortunate enough to have a Super Audio CD player -- the finest sound currently available in my opinion. Highly recommended.
B000002J1F|5.0|There were two albums released by Yes in the year 1972--the stellar `Close to the Edge' and this earlier effort, `Fragile.'  Yes--at this point consisting of Jon Anderson on lead vocals, Bill Bruford on drums, Steve Howe on guitars, Chris Squire on bass, and the newly-recruited Rick Wakeman on keyboards--had just scored a decent breakthrough with their third album, `The Yes Album,' in the previous year.  They had actually broken the charts in America, and they had finally reached and fortified what would be their characteristic sound in the years and albums to come.    So where does `Fragile' fit into all that?  The original nine tracks on `Fragile' are widely considered quintessential progressive rock, a template from which myriad later acts would spawn.  From start to finish, `Fragile' plays like well-oiled machinery (even with its occasional catches and blips), and its main material--the longer suites, mostly--demonstrates the level of maturity the band had ultimately achieved by this time in their collective career.  Oh, and `Fragile' also brings to the table a little something called \\"Roundabout,\\" which may well be the band's most famous song ever.    What are we waiting for?  The songs (in detail):    1. \\"Roundabout\\" - Well, well.  Do I really need to comment upon this one?  Unlike many popular, therefore overplayed songs, this one just doesn't get old.  Play it as many times as you like, and it still captivates.  Right from the onset, with Steve Howe's guitar harmonics, one can hear the innovation and compositional brilliance of the band.  And as the introduction moves on into the body of the piece, an irresistible lick makes itself heard again and again, though it never grows tiresome.  The middle section of the piece, with its fantastically arranged vocals, inspires pure awe, and the soft and pensive section which follows adds a much-appreciated dynamic contrast.  The Mellotron flutes are particularly nice, though of course they only play a few poly-chords.What follows is one of Rick Wakeman's most spectacular solo escapades (though of course the one in \\"Close to the Edge\\" is his supreme solo effort), a repetition of earlier parts of the song, and the riveting conclusion, replete in layered, overdubbed vocals and presented with minimal backing to enhance the effect.  A simple flourish by Steve Howe ends the piece in understatement.  In a word, stunning.    2. \\"Cans And Brahms\\" - This is Rick Wakeman's showcase song on the album (each member gets a chance to show off in solo).  It's not bad, though it's not original.  It's basically an arrangement of various Brahms melodies, played on slightly unconventional instrumentation.  The work demonstrates for all to see Wakeman's peerless technical ability, but I do wish he (or the band in care of him) would have come up with something original.  Still, though, it's short enough that it goes by before it overstays its welcome.    3. \\"We Have Heaven\\" - This is Jon Anderson's chance to shine.  Here, in a vivid, multilayered arrangement, he sings a bunch of nonsense, albeit in impressive fashion.  Though I respect the tremendous skill required to have laid down such a track, I personally find this work insufferably annoying and repetitive.  It did not make it onto my iPod.    4. \\"South Side Of The Sky\\" - Ah, here we are with the second of the epic pieces.  This one is a great deal darker and more angular than \\"Roundabout,\\" and its lyrics allegedly deal with a failed Antarctic expedition where the explorers end up dying.  Though with Yes, you can never be sure.  Even so, this song is a true masterpiece of instrumentation, beginning with a brumal blast of synthesized Antarctic wind (apparently previous editions of the album also included footsteps, which have now been moved to the end of the previous track, where I have never heard them because I can't stand to listen to the third track to completion), and--in that weird Yes-esque manner--it rocks.  The middle section is a dark,piano-dominated piece of disjointed yet substantial clockwork, culminating in a neutral vocal section which might be representative of the gates of heaven opening for the doomed explorers.  After a return to the motifs from the beginning of the song, the work ends on a fadeout into the same howling wind with which it began.    5. \\"Five Per Cent For Nothing\\" - It might take you longer to read this description than it would for you to listen to the song.  It's really that short--around 35 seconds or so.  Bruford's showcase, it's a little drum pattern, repeated twice, with instrumentation from the rest of the band thrown in for good measure.  I guess they figured 35 seconds is about five percent of a song, so that's how they arrived at this title.  It makes a nice little introduction to the next track, so it works.    6. \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" - This is the infamous pop monster that, nonetheless, maintains the progressive feel so integral to Yes.  It's pleasant to listen to, and it's one of the shorter of Yes's full-band involvement songs up to this point.  The beginning line, with Steve Howe's expert guitar work running in parallel across the stereo field, is a sound to behold.  Once Chris Squire enters the fray, things get really interesting.  This song has one of the most enduring bass lines ever conceived, even among Yes songs.  Squire is among the most innovative of bassists, and his trademark, treble-heavy tone really helps the mood of this piece.  And, of course, Jon Anderson is up in the stratosphere singing away about nothing.  But then, Yes is music where, though very pretty in their own right, the lyrics are unimportant.  Anderson's lyrics paint pictures of emotion, they don't broadcast it of their own volition.  In this he was one of music's greatest poets.    7. \\"The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus)\\" - Here's a shocker: All the instrumentation that isn't drums is performed by Chris Squire's bass.  What an original concept!  If only the band had expoundedupon what they had discovered here, they could really have come up with some interesting material.  Even so, this is by far one of the most interesting of tracks from `Fragile.'  \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" segues into this track, so \\"The Fish\\" is akin to a separate movement of the previous track.  Oh, and yes, they do sing the words \\"Schindleria Praematurus\\" at the end of the song.  Why?  I don't know.  Obviously it's the Latin name for a fish, but as to why it was chosen to name this song, I have no clue.    8. \\"Mood For A Day\\" - It's Howe's turn up to bat, with this showcase song.  I never though much of \\"Clap\\" (often mislabeled \\"The Clap\\" to the horror and extreme annoyance of Steve Howe), and I suppose that holds true for this song as well.

I considered altering the track before putting it on my iPod (basically removing that ending section), but I couldn't bring myself to desecrate a progressive rock masterpiece in that manner, even if I don't agree with the way it was arranged.    I feel I must point out to those who are viewing this particular page with the intent of purchasing the item listed that, in 2003, Rhino Records re-remastered most of the Yes catalogue, including 'Fragile.'  The Rhino remasters are generally deemed superior in sound quality to the Atlantic set from 1994; additionally, the Rhinos sport bonus tracks, and all albums (except for 1980's 'Drama') with Roger Dean artwork come in digipack/slip cover enclosure.    Overall, I would recommend `Fragile' to just about anyone, particularly those new to Yes.  In this instance, there is nothing wrong with this release that would make it \\"for newbies.\\"  On the contrary, this album offers a vivid picture of just what made Yes the masterful progressive rock band it was, in a manner that is akin to on-the-job training.  This album was made to make music, not to indoctrinate or placate fans.

Thank God for `Fragile,' or there might never have been a `Close to the Edge.'
B000HCO840|4.0|I dont get why people didnt like this movie, although its not better than the second its still very good, it has that sense of closure that a final chapter should have. But i have to agree in the misuse of the character Angel, he appeared in all marketing media, but in the movie he is useless. The two deaths worked for me as the whole movie, its not perfect but it was a good conclusion....    Now onto the DVD    I dont understand why they didnt work on a better one, no featurettes, mainly deleted scenes whick i like, and the trailers, which i also like to see, but it would have been nice to have a documentary or something... even the hostel dvd had one.    I bought the special edition (expecting like most people for extra features) and even if it has a atractive package (which i actually like although it looks fragile), its the same movie, the comic book i havent read but i liked the comic book that came with Batman Begins De Luxe Edition, so its pretty sure i will like it.....    Video and sound quality great.... only complain, no extra features like most movies.    In a last note: Some people complain about a lack of character development, what did you expect, you had two films developing them, the last one its about the action.... although the new mutants should have a little more time on screen.
B00000DOZ7|5.0|The year is 1971, and Atlantic records has reached a critical, if unspoken, decision in regards to the promising British band Yes: If the band's third studio attempt follows in the wake of the past two, then the label has no choice but to drop the band.  This sort of ultimatum abounds often in the music business, as bands fail initially to meet sales expectations.  It happened with Kansas after their third album, 'Masque' (1975), much in the same way it happened with Yes earlier in the 1970s. <br /> <br />Luckily, neither band surrendered to the tremendous pressure generated by their precarious contract positions, and both bands produced successful albums when it really counted. <br /> <br />What follows is a description of Yes' triumph, 'The Yes Album.' <br /> <br />Something clicked in the group between the previous 'Time and a Word' release and this one.  That something, many believe, was the exodus of Peter Banks and the inauguration of supreme guitar talent Steve Howe.  The lineup, then, stood as follows: Jon Anderson on lead vocals, Bill Bruford on drums, Steve Howe on guitar, Tony Kaye on keyboards, and Chris Squire on bass, with Howe and Squire contributing their backup vocals where needed.  Howe brought to the table something the band sorely lacked: a lead guitarist.  Banks was decent at what he did, but he was not strong enough by any means to carry the band.  Steve Howe, however, was a master of his instrument, and it really shows on this album--previously almost unheard, the guitar takes the center stage as the solo instrument par excellence on 'The Yes Album.' <br /> <br />On top of his game also was every other member of the band.  Tony Kaye, while never even close to Rick Wakeman (who would succeed Kaye on the following year's 'Fragile' release), evolved into something of a competent keyboardist on this album.  At very least he left behind the cheesy, dated, '60s style organ registrations in favor of the timeless, distorted Hammond sound that definesclassic and progressive rock.  Bill Bruford stopped playing like a typical, generic drummer, and began asserting himself for the truly innovative magician he is.  Chris Squire finally dropped once and for all the psychedelic wah-wah effect, turned up the treble on his Rickenbacker, and what do you know: The celebrated, trademark Squire bass sound was born.  And Jon Anderson sang better than ever, both clearer and with greater tonal accuracy.  Also, and perhaps most prudently, Anderson made the transition from writing pedestrian lyrics to painting images with words and poetry, while relying on the music itself to complete the pieces and affect the flow.  This high-brow, esoteric lyrical content--the meaning of which is completed by the instrumentation--is one of the defining qualities of Yes, and is one of the many reasons why Yes is both a musicians' and an intellectuals' band. <br /> <br />That having been said, the \\"sixth member\\" of the band, producer Eddie Offord, really saved the day on this album.  He sculpted what we now identify as the \\"Yes sound,\\" that extremely clean and precise timbre that is unique to the band.  Everything that needed to be warm and analog (Steve Howe's guitar and Jon Anderson's vocals, for example) is presented richly, and everything that needed to be well-defined (Bill Bruford's drums and Chris Squire's bass) stands out in the mix.  And everything that was there just for accompaniment (sorry, Tony) was parried into the mix nicely, where it is neither swallowed nor oppressive. <br /> <br />The music on this release is a departure from anything the band had ever attempted before it.  Gone is any shred of the Beatles, bereft is the album of any covers, and we can all fondly say goodbye to the awkward arrangements and poor final production that plagued the previous releases.  This album sets the stage for the prolific and magnificent work the band would produce through and including the 1977 'Going for the One' release.  On 'The Yes Album,'the band had finally found its core sound and its comfort zone.  'The Yes Album' is dominated by four long epic suites, which are all structured in a similar manner.  And yet, within each distinct work, there is myriad experimentation and instrumental musing.  However, there is an underlying structure that keeps the work from passing beyond the realm of interest.  The two shorter works, including a showcase by Steve Howe, serve as intermissions in a sense between the larger, grander works. <br /> <br />Now for a detailed description of each track: <br /> <br />1. \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" - Right from the onset, with the bass/drum pattern, one knows he or she is hearing something grand and spectacular.  This pattern is repeated twice, and then the distorted Hammond organ overlays this bass/drum pattern as it perpetuates and modulates keys.  Enter Steve Howe, with his trademark guitar, which those listening to the album in 1971 heard for the first time.  He plays a virtuosic passage right over this growing bed of instrumentation, and in that instant a band is born. <br /> <br />The piece meanders gloriously through numerous vocal and instrumental escapades, never waning in interest or intensity.  There are quiet passages, long solo passages, and intense, layered vocal passages.  The lyrics seem to mean very little, even after one listens to the song many times, but there we have the magic of Yes: The lyrics don't have to mean anything at all, so long as the bond between them and the music remains sound.  And Jon Anderson was a master of engineering this bond, and the results are positively beautiful.  Ladies and gentlemen, this music is the definition of progressive rock: It transcends the here and now and the mundane, and transports the listener to a world where the rules don't always apply, and where all that matters is the music. <br /> <br />2. \\"Clap\\" (NOT \\"The Clap\\") - This is Steve Howe's showcase tune.  It's a live track, recorded in a very warm-sounding and reverberant location.  I am not a guitarist, and by virtue, I tend to become bored with these sorts of things.  It is the same with \\"Mood for a Day\\" on the next release, 'Fragile.'  It is such that I am not qualified to really evaluate this song musically, though of course in the technical sense it is dazzling.  Steve Howe, in my opinion, is one of the two greatest guitarists in the history of the art.  Therefore, he has every right to be rather annoyed that people keep calling his song \\"The Clap\\" (even the record producers!). <br /> <br />3. \\"Starship Trooper\\" - This song is structured a little differently from the first epic.  This piece comes in three distinct movements, \\"Life Seeker,\\" \\"Disillusion,\\" and \\"Wurm\\" (Wurm is a glacial valley in Europe and might be the genesis of the name of this movement, the instrumentation of which indeed conjures images of fjords and such).  The tale is again told through cryptic poetry bound to its music, and the first movement is anchored by Squire's trademark bass and Howe's indispensable electric guitar.  The second movement begins abruptly with Howe's frantic acoustic guitar strumming and a different vocal melody.  An innovative bridge returns to the first theme before the final movement, an instrumental, begins.  This movement gains in intensity before a truly phenomenal, forward-miced Howe solo rips into the open musical space and crowns the fadeout. <br /> <br />4. \\"I've Seen All Good People\\" - This is the infamous single from the album, and behind \\"Owner Of A Lonely Heart\\" and \\"Roundabout,\\" it is probably Yes's most well-known song.  A double-movement work, the song begins with the skeletal sounding \\"Your Move,\\" possessed of an insistent thumping double-strummed bass note, anchored by the bass drum.  The heavy vocal harmonies that begin this piece are a capella, and the instrumentation is mostly acoustic (there are even recorders).  Just before the climax of this movement, Tony Kaye plays what is probably the most significantpassage of his entire career with the band when his massive, distorted Hammond enters perfectly on cue to produce a positively gravitational effect.  At the end of this sequence, there is a swell on the organ until it seems as though one's head might explode, and then a ringing silence.  Then begins the second movement, an energetic rocker called \\"All Good People.\\"  The same words, \\"I've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satisfied I'm on my way,\\" are repeated over and over again, the music building in intensity, until the final fadeout, where the band--complimented by that blasting organ--sings the phrase in a continually descending tonality each time until the fadeout is complete. <br /> <br />Despite this rather orgasmic description of the song, of the four epics on this album, this one is my least favorite.  I will always remember it affectionately as the first Yes song I ever heard and wanted to own, and that is perhaps why I don't like it so well as I did in the past: I believe I am simply tired of it.  And of the four epic tracks, this is the only one you will ever hear on the radio anymore.  And so progressive rock dies a little more by the hands of the media conglomerate who have, since about 1974, acted in concert to achieve just that end: the death of progressive rock. <br /> <br />They will never succeed. <br /> <br />5. \\"A Venture\\" - This is the second shorter track from the album, and another I am not really qualified to describe.  It could be because I really don't like it very much that I am unable to comment.  Certainly this would contribute to an explanation for why I don't even remember how it goes, only that I never liked it.  I vaguely remember that it had a pastoral feel and that it was piano-dominated.  Kaye actually wasn't a bad keyboardist overall, and in any band other than Yes he would have seemed very good.  When among giants, however, a mere mortal--no matter how tall--just doesn't measure up.  A good effort, nonetheless,on a rather substandard song. <br /> <br />6. \\"Perpetual Change\\" - This is the sixth and final epic on the original album.  It basically follows the same form as the others, and includes many of the same elements that make the other three great.  The beginning is a very intense introduction, akin to the one on the later \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" on `Fragile.'  Then, in an almost jazzy fashion, the actual sung part of the song begins very softly, building gradually to the words \\"perpetual change.\\"  This pattern repeats several times throughout the song, and then a completely new section (the chorus) begins, with Jon Anderson singing up in the stratosphere as he usually does, the melody triumphant and uplifting.  After this sequence from the first theme to the chorus is repeated twice, a totally new section begins in stark juxtaposition.  This section, an instrumental, makes use of some advanced panning and other studio trickery, and it brilliantly weaves themes from the entire song together.  A return to the pattern from before, and then a unique fadeout sequence complete this piece, a very strong finish to a very strong album. <br /> <br />For the benefit of those who are viewing this item's page with the intent of purchasing this particular edition, I feel I need to inform (or remind) you that Rhino Records re-remastered most of the Yes catalogue in 2003, 'The Yes Album' included.  The Rhino remasters are generally considered superior in sound quality to both the 1994 Atlantic remasters and the original 1990 set; additionally, the Rhinos include bonus tracks and come in digipack/slip cover cases (for albums with artwork by Roger Dean, excluding 1980's 'Drama'). <br /> <br />Overall, this is where I would recommend new Yes fans to start with the band.  Everything you need to get a solid impression of what the band was all about is right here.  And yet, this album doesn't have training wheels; there's nothing less impressive about this album then, say, `Fragile' or `Close to the Edge' (all right, nothing really compares to `Close,' but that's a given).  Basically, this album is the most accessible of the first three classic Yes albums, and it's where the band really found its characteristic sound.  It's always a good idea to start at the beginning, so I would start with `The Yes Album,' then go from there.  And, on a broader scale, I would recommend this album to just about anyone in the world, really.  There are some things that were just destined to be classics.  `The Yes Album' is one of them.
B000FQJAIW|3.0|I was excited to hear that the original cuts of \\"Star Wars\\" would see an official DVD release and was just as profoundly disappointed to learn that the quality wouldn't be much better than the bootlegs floating around since they're both essentially copies of the laserdisc version. I can live with the grain and print damage but the lack of anamorphic enhancement is as baffling as it is inexcusable. The films are still great fun, but the handling of the original cuts in this \\"limited edition\\" release is at best a lazy cash-in and at worst a cynical one. <br /> <br />All the people who say \\"there was no 16x9 in 1977\\" don't seem to realize that hundreds of movies released before 1977 are available on DVD in anamorphic widescreen. And many of those have visual effects that look far more dated than the original \\"Star Wars\\". 16x9 enhancement is all about the home video presentation, it has nothing to do with how the film was shot.

Gone is any shred of the Beatles, bereft is the album of any covers, and we can all fondly say goodbye to the awkward arrangements and poor final production that plagued the previous releases.  This album sets the stage for the prolific and magnificent work the band would produce through and including the 1977 'Going for the One' release.  On 'The Yes Album,'the band had finally found its core sound and its comfort zone.  'The Yes Album' is dominated by four long epic suites, which are all structured in a similar manner.  And yet, within each distinct work, there is myriad experimentation and instrumental musing.  However, there is an underlying structure that keeps the work from passing beyond the realm of interest.  The two shorter works, including a showcase by Steve Howe, serve as intermissions in a sense between the larger, grander works. <br /> <br />Now for a detailed description of each track: <br /> <br />1. \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" - Right from the onset, with the bass/drum pattern, one knows he or she is hearing something grand and spectacular.  This pattern is repeated twice, and then the distorted Hammond organ overlays this bass/drum pattern as it perpetuates and modulates keys.  Enter Steve Howe, with his trademark guitar, which those listening to the album in 1971 heard for the first time.  He plays a virtuosic passage right over this growing bed of instrumentation, and in that instant a band is born. <br /> <br />The piece meanders gloriously through numerous vocal and instrumental escapades, never waning in interest or intensity.  There are quiet passages, long solo passages, and intense, layered vocal passages.  The lyrics seem to mean very little, even after one listens to the song many times, but there we have the magic of Yes: The lyrics don't have to mean anything at all, so long as the bond between them and the music remains sound.  And Jon Anderson was a master of engineering this bond, and the results are positively beautiful.  Ladies and gentlemen, this music is the definition of progressive rock: It transcends the here and now and the mundane, and transports the listener to a world where the rules don't always apply, and where all that matters is the music. <br /> <br />2. \\"Clap\\" (NOT \\"The Clap\\") - This is Steve Howe's showcase tune.  It's a live track, recorded in a very warm-sounding and reverberant location.  I am not a guitarist, and by virtue, I tend to become bored with these sorts of things.  It is the same with \\"Mood for a Day\\" on the next release, 'Fragile.'  It is such that I am not qualified to really evaluate this song musically, though of course in the technical sense it is dazzling.  Steve Howe, in my opinion, is one of the two greatest guitarists in the history of the art.  Therefore, he has every right to be rather annoyed that people keep calling his song \\"The Clap\\" (even the record producers!). <br /> <br />3. \\"Starship Trooper\\" - This song is structured a little differently from the first epic.  This piece comes in three distinct movements, \\"Life Seeker,\\" \\"Disillusion,\\" and \\"Wurm\\" (Wurm is a glacial valley in Europe and might be the genesis of the name of this movement, the instrumentation of which indeed conjures images of fjords and such).  The tale is again told through cryptic poetry bound to its music, and the first movement is anchored by Squire's trademark bass and Howe's indispensable electric guitar.  The second movement begins abruptly with Howe's frantic acoustic guitar strumming and a different vocal melody.  An innovative bridge returns to the first theme before the final movement, an instrumental, begins.  This movement gains in intensity before a truly phenomenal, forward-miced Howe solo rips into the open musical space and crowns the fadeout. <br /> <br />4. \\"I've Seen All Good People\\" - This is the infamous single from the album, and behind \\"Owner Of A Lonely Heart\\" and \\"Roundabout,\\" it is probably Yes's most well-known song.  A double-movement work, the song begins with the skeletal sounding \\"Your Move,\\" possessed of an insistent thumping double-strummed bass note, anchored by the bass drum.  The heavy vocal harmonies that begin this piece are a capella, and the instrumentation is mostly acoustic (there are even recorders).  Just before the climax of this movement, Tony Kaye plays what is probably the most significantpassage of his entire career with the band when his massive, distorted Hammond enters perfectly on cue to produce a positively gravitational effect.  At the end of this sequence, there is a swell on the organ until it seems as though one's head might explode, and then a ringing silence.  Then begins the second movement, an energetic rocker called \\"All Good People.\\"  The same words, \\"I've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satisfied I'm on my way,\\" are repeated over and over again, the music building in intensity, until the final fadeout, where the band--complimented by that blasting organ--sings the phrase in a continually descending tonality each time until the fadeout is complete. <br /> <br />Despite this rather orgasmic description of the song, of the four epics on this album, this one is my least favorite.  I will always remember it affectionately as the first Yes song I ever heard and wanted to own, and that is perhaps why I don't like it so well as I did in the past: I believe I am simply tired of it.  And of the four epic tracks, this is the only one you will ever hear on the radio anymore.  And so progressive rock dies a little more by the hands of the media conglomerate who have, since about 1974, acted in concert to achieve just that end: the death of progressive rock. <br /> <br />They will never succeed. <br /> <br />5. \\"A Venture\\" - This is the second shorter track from the album, and another I am not really qualified to describe.  It could be because I really don't like it very much that I am unable to comment.  Certainly this would contribute to an explanation for why I don't even remember how it goes, only that I never liked it.  I vaguely remember that it had a pastoral feel and that it was piano-dominated.  Kaye actually wasn't a bad keyboardist overall, and in any band other than Yes he would have seemed very good.  When among giants, however, a mere mortal--no matter how tall--just doesn't measure up.  A good effort, nonetheless,on a rather substandard song. <br /> <br />6. \\"Perpetual Change\\" - This is the sixth and final epic on the original album.  It basically follows the same form as the others, and includes many of the same elements that make the other three great.  The beginning is a very intense introduction, akin to the one on the later \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" on `Fragile.'  Then, in an almost jazzy fashion, the actual sung part of the song begins very softly, building gradually to the words \\"perpetual change.\\"  This pattern repeats several times throughout the song, and then a completely new section (the chorus) begins, with Jon Anderson singing up in the stratosphere as he usually does, the melody triumphant and uplifting.  After this sequence from the first theme to the chorus is repeated twice, a totally new section begins in stark juxtaposition.  This section, an instrumental, makes use of some advanced panning and other studio trickery, and it brilliantly weaves themes from the entire song together.  A return to the pattern from before, and then a unique fadeout sequence complete this piece, a very strong finish to a very strong album. <br /> <br />Overall, this is where I would recommend new Yes fans to start with the band.  Everything you need to get a solid impression of what the band was all about is right here.  And yet, this album doesn't have training wheels; there's nothing less impressive about this album then, say, `Fragile' or `Close to the Edge' (all right, nothing really compares to `Close,' but that's a given).  Basically, this album is the most accessible of the first three classic Yes albums, and it's where the band really found its characteristic sound.  It's always a good idea to start at the beginning, so I would start with `The Yes Album,' then go from there.  And, on a broader scale, I would recommend this album to just about anyone in the world, really.  There are some things that were just destined to be classics.  `The Yes Album' is one of them.
0780629450|1.0|I love \\"Hamlet\\"--that is, all except Kenneth Brannagh's version which is ponderously directed and embarassingly cast with box office draws of the day like a fumbling Jack Lemmon, a heavily accented Gerard Deparidieu and a seriously lost Billy Crystal. Ye gods, I walked out of the movie theatre during the Ghost's story. I rented the video when it first came out, hoping that my initial response had been wrong. But again I couldn't watch the whole thing. I tried to watch Charleton Heston as the Player King and all I could hear was Cecil B. DeMille!<br /><br />In the leads, Brannagh is too thin-lipped and Pilsbury-dough-boyish to play the Dane, as are the unintentionally funny Julie Christie and Derek Jacobi, too plump and docile for Gertrude and Claudius. Only the always remarkable Kate Winslet is able to transcend this boorish production.<br /><br />Those that love this version don't realize that the Elizabethan actors spoke their lines incredibly fast in front of an Elizabethan audience who were used their speed-of-light-delivery. The tempo of this Hamlet is dirge-like from beginning to end. Ho-hum...<br /><br />So, if you're wondering why this version hasn't been transferred to DVD re-read this review and be glad. Check out the Russian Hamlet and even Mel Gibson's take has greater passion.
B00000DOZV|5.0|After the unexpected success of the first Phil Collins-era album, 1976's 'A Trick of the Tail,' the British progressive rock band Genesis knew they needed something of at least equal caliber in order to maintain the sudden increase in the size of their fan base.  Very rarely is it that a band will record and release two full-scale albums within the space of a year (fellow British progressive rock band Yes did it in 1972 with 'Fragile' and 'Close to the Edge,' and the American progressive rock band Kansas did it in 1975 with 'Song For America' and 'Masque').  There is good reason for this: Often times, the quality of the second release suffers both from the lack of time devoted to its composition and production, and from comparison to its predecessor (incidentally, this was true of Kansas, but not of Yes).  Fortunately, this is not the case with 'Wind & Wuthering,' which was released in the last week of 1976 in the United States and in the beginning of 1977 in Britain.  In some ways, 'Wind' is a more mature and well-developed musical statement than 'Trick.' <br /> <br />Let's explore that statement.  The most apparent difference between 'Trick' and 'Wind' is in the overall mood of the collective whole of each album.  'Trick' is eclectic musically, whereas 'Wind' is somewhat contiguous.  Specifically, 'Wind' has an autumnal or brumal cast, facilitated by the collective prowess of the band but most apparent in the treatment of keyboardist Tony Banks's Mellotron passages.  On 'Trick' the Mellotron had a more vibrant, unfiltered tone.  On 'Wind,' however, the Mellotron is bathed in reverberation and processed to silky smoothness; this lends a distant, more desolate tone to the majority of the album.  Also significant is the inclusion of icy, neutral male background vocals.  On 'Trick,' the Mellotron 8-Note Chorus was used for this effect.  On 'Wind' this chorus tape set is never used.  Instead, the background vocals (particularly prominent in the closing track) are usedexclusively. <br /> <br />There are other differences, though.  Steve Hackett's contributions are much less noticeable on this album than on previous efforts.  Much of his playing is buried beneath Banks's synthesizers, and Hackett's normally integral songwriting offerings are more sparse.  Furthermore, the band outright rejected some of his submissions, which led in part to his exodus from Genesis after this album (they would be terribly crippled by this--it seems Hackett was even more important to the band than former frontman Peter Gabriel, who left before 'Trick'). <br /> <br />Finally, and perhaps more importantly, the lyrics on 'Wind' are, on the whole, much darker and more mature than those of 'Trick.'  There is also a much greater degree of social commentary on this album, and some of it is more literal than the clever allegory and allusion found on 'Trick.'  Neither approach is necessarily better than the other; indeed, the difference heightens the value of both albums symbiotically.  Even so, it is worth mentioning that 'Wind' seems almost like a culmination of an artform and the sunset of an era.  And, in many ways, it was.  Apart from the quasi-progressive stylings of 'Duke' in 1980, 'Wind' was the last truly progressive album Genesis ever released. <br /> <br />The track listing, along with my comments: <br /> <br /> <br />1.  \\"Eleventh Earl Of Mar\\" - This is one of my favorite tracks on the album.  The organization of an album is important--a band will try to place the most initially appealing figures first so that prospective listeners will be captivated right from the onset.  Genesis excels at this sort of thing, and they were no less successful with \\"Earl.\\"  An intriguing and worm-like synthesizer/organ theme repeats itself several times, with Hackett's guitar joining in for good measure.  The opening sequence moves toward a dramatic swell on the Mellotron strings, followed by a chord shift.  A hint of things to come appears first on the Hammond organ, and is confirmed when Collins enters with a brilliant drum fill. <br /> <br />The song consists of three distinct parts: The first includes the introduction and the main A and B sections, each of which is a unique and dynamic listening experience.  The second part is a soft, pensive moment that contrasts the first part beautifully.  The final part is a reprise of the first section, along with a conclusion (which harkens back to the introduction, expanding this theme and ending on the decay of a massive chord). <br /> <br />Lyrically, this song seems to tell the story of a child who loves his father despite the man's neglect of his son.  The father is called to fight in a bloody and impossible war, and while he is away, he thinks about his son and some very tender moments they had spent together.  At several intervals the son begs his father to promise that he will return alive from the battle.  Perhaps these instances are also memories.  Unfortunately, it is apparent that the father perishes in the battle, and the son's last cry to his father is unanswered, raw, and anguished. <br /> <br />2.  \\"One For The Vine\\" - This is a return to the Genesis epic format.  At exactly 10:00, this is one of the longest Genesis songs ever recorded in the Collins-era.  Musically, this one is very interesting--it begins softly with Hackett's guitar and Banks's piano.  The lyrics are performed in a very straightforward sort of manner, though the rhythm is often unusual.  On the choruses, the first ever instance of the heavily chorused, treble-heavy effect used with wild abandon on Collins's voice in the 1980s appears.  Perhaps this is to facilitate clarity, considering that Collins had at this point still not effectively mastered proper announciation.  Aside from all this, a standout feature of this selection is the highly energetic solo section in the middle, which seems to induce involuntary movement in all those who listen to it.  It seems almost impossible to control the impulse to just get up and move around when this section is playing; it's very uplifting and musically appealing. <br /> <br />Lyrically, this song is the first of the social commentaries, and it deals with the messiahdom expressed by organized religion.  The story is brilliant: A fellow who is part of a group who enter battle in the name of a divinity suddenly loses faith and leaves the charge.  He wanders into a mountain settlement, where he is instantly seen as \\"he the chosen one\\" by the natives.  The fellow at first accepts this treatment, until he realizes this is exactly that from which he fled.  At this moment, he leaves the settlement and comes upon a stream, where he can explore himself through introspective.  As he returns to the plateau, he notices another large group of soldiers.  He then glimpses one who leaves the group--he recognizes it as himself.  And so messiahdom is cyclical. <br /> <br />3.  \\"Your Own Special Way\\" - I'm sorry--this song is an embarrassment.  It is close to the worst thing to carry the Genesis name, I believe (though of course nothing is worse than \\"Whodunnit\\" from 1981's 'Abacab').  \\"Way\\" is a disgusting, sappy pop ballad.  What's more, it isn't a particularly good one, either.  And it certainly doesn't belong on a progressive rock masterpiece such as 'Wind & Wuthering.'  Finally (I really am giving this one a beating), though I would have to check the chronology to see which is the original source, this song sounds too much like \\"Endless Love\\" for there to have been a conincidence.  It's quite obvious that one or the other was derived from whichever of the two came first. <br /> <br />4.  \\"Wot Gorilla?\\" - This is an instrumental that has never been counted among Genesis's finest.  Aurally it seems to have a jungle cast, but this seems forced.  It certainly isn't a bad piece of music, but Genesis has done much better instrumentals (\\"Los Endos\\" and \\"Duke's Travels/Duke's End\\" come to mind, as well as the seventh and eighth tracks on 'Wind'). <br /> <br />5.  \\"All In A Mouse's Night\\" - This track reflects the tongue-in-cheek humor of 'Trick,' particularly \\"Robbery, Assault And Battery.\\"  Incidentally, \\"Mouse\\" and the latter song share the same track position on their respective albums.  However, \\"Mouse\\" presents its story in a much darker, serious fashion.  This, in part, contributes to the humor through irony.  Musically, this song flows nicely, following a song form similar to that of the first track on the album.  The song ends with a beautiful instrumental section that fades into oblivion in a stately, measured, understated manner.  Hackett's guitar finds some rare glory in this section. <br /> <br />Lyrically, this song tells the story of a mouse that finds itself in a house where it is suddenly discovered by the owners.  It escapes persecution, only to almost literally run into the cat.  Assured of itself, the cat taunts the mouse long enough for an object to fall upon the cat's head, thereby allowing the mouse to escape yet again.  The cat then comes up with a tall tale to excuse his failure to catch the mouse.  The words may or may not have hidden meaning; perhaps the humor is solely derived from the juxtaposition of such a silly, prosaic tale with the mood of the music to which it is set. <br /> <br />6.  \\"Blood On The Rooftops\\" - This song is a dark, brooding masterpiece.  The Mellotron is used expertly to achieve just the proper effect, the synthesizers compliment the mood perfectly, and Hackett shines more brightly than at any other point in the album with an inspired, naked acousitc guitar solo at the beginning of the song.  Such delicacy, coupled with such unbridled power and drive, are heard in quantities approaching those on 'Wind' virtually nowhere else in the music world, and this is exemplified by this song.  The choruses are some of the most chilling, riveting moments on the album, and they, along with the remainder of the song, epitomize the aural character of the entire 'Wind& Wuthering' release. <br /> <br />Content-wise, this one is pretty straightforward.  This song deals with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the constant coverage offered by the media.  The song also hints at the impersonal aspect of this coverage and how it is proliferated in similar fashion all across the world.  Classic symbols like rain and blood are used to support a somber tone in this song, which is one of Genesis's finest achievements. <br /> <br />7.  \\"Unquiet Slumbers For The Sleepers...\\" - This is the first of two conjoined instrumentals on the album, both of which derive their names from the final sentence in the Emily Bronte novel 'Wuthering Heights' (incidentally, this is also the source for the name of the album).  This instrumental is very soft and pensive; it is also the shorter of the two.  The synthesizer program used for the melody is hauntingly gorgeous, almost like a cross between whistling and a beautiful soprano voice.  This track segues into the second instrumental in the sequence. <br /> <br />8.  \\"...In That Quiet Earth\\" - This is often cited as one of Genesis's finest instrumentals.  It is more animated than the previous track, is composed of several different sections, and is a keyboard workout for Tony Banks.  The synthesizers used here are varied and intricately-entwined.  There is a sense of movement about this work, a sense that it is not the end but a means to an end.  And, in that respect, such a sense proves correct.  This work segues into the final track on the album. <br /> <br />9.  \\"Afterglow\\" - There are many wonderful songs on 'Wind,' but there are some days when I consider \\"Afterglow\\" my favorite.  There is so much to be said in this song, and it accomplishes it with so small a footprint (4:12) as to intensify the already electric quality of the music.  The song moves along at a slow, stately, inevitable pace.  Phil Collins's vocal is delivered with a bastion of emotional output rarely matched by other vocalists.  The melody, a simple one, is soul-fulfilling.  It's a song to sing at the end of all things, when one's world has come crashing down around him.  And the ending sequence, with its myriad intricate layered vocals, is ethereal and breathtaking.  The impact of these icy sustained phrases, comprised entirely of the word \\"Ahh!\\", is simply unparalled.  It's the perfect ending to the album, the setting of the sun, the end of an era. <br /> <br /> <br />So, above all, this album is one of Genesis's finest.  There are occasional weak moments, but on the whole it is a masterpiece.  It is especially impactful when taken alongside 'A Trick of the Tail,' as these two albums compliment one another perfectly.  Each is what the other is not, and together they run the gamut of symphonic progressive rock.  I would recommend this album to fans of Genesis from all periods (both Gabriel-era and later Collins-era); it will require some acclimation, particularly for later Collins-era fans, but it is very much worth the time.
B00007M8S9|5.0|The year is 1971, and Atlantic records has reached a critical, if unspoken, decision in regards to the promising British band Yes: If the band's third studio attempt follows in the wake of the past two, then the label has no choice but to drop the band.  This sort of ultimatum abounds often in the music business, as bands fail initially to meet sales expectations.  It happened with Kansas after their third album, 'Masque' (1975), much in the same way it happened with Yes earlier in the 1970s. <br /> <br />Luckily, neither band surrendered to the tremendous pressure generated by their precarious contract positions, and both bands produced successful albums when it really counted. <br /> <br />What follows is a description of Yes' triumph, 'The Yes Album.' <br /> <br />Something clicked in the group between the previous 'Time and a Word' release and this one.  That something, many believe, was the exodus of Peter Banks and the inauguration of supreme guitar talent Steve Howe.  The lineup, then, stood as follows: Jon Anderson on lead vocals, Bill Bruford on drums, Steve Howe on guitar, Tony Kaye on keyboards, and Chris Squire on bass, with Howe and Squire contributing their backup vocals where needed.  Howe brought to the table something the band sorely lacked: a lead guitarist.  Banks was decent at what he did, but he was not strong enough by any means to carry the band.  Steve Howe, however, was a master of his instrument, and it really shows on this album--previously almost unheard, the guitar takes the center stage as the solo instrument par excellence on 'The Yes Album.' <br /> <br />On top of his game also was every other member of the band.  Tony Kaye, while never even close to Rick Wakeman (who would succeed Kaye on the following year's 'Fragile' release), evolved into something of a competent keyboardist on this album.  At very least he left behind the cheesy, dated, '60s style organ registrations in favor of the timeless, distorted Hammond sound that definesclassic and progressive rock.  Bill Bruford stopped playing like a typical, generic drummer, and began asserting himself for the truly innovative magician he is.  Chris Squire finally dropped once and for all the psychedelic wah-wah effect, turned up the treble on his Rickenbacker, and what do you know: The celebrated, trademark Squire bass sound was born.  And Jon Anderson sang better than ever, both clearer and with greater tonal accuracy.  Also, and perhaps most prudently, Anderson made the transition from writing pedestrian lyrics to painting images with words and poetry, while relying on the music itself to complete the pieces and affect the flow.  This high-brow, esoteric lyrical content--the meaning of which is completed by the instrumentation--is one of the defining qualities of Yes, and is one of the many reasons why Yes is both a musicians' and an intellectuals' band. <br /> <br />That having been said, the \\"sixth member\\" of the band, producer Eddie Offord, really saved the day on this album.  He sculpted what we now identify as the \\"Yes sound,\\" that extremely clean and precise timbre that is unique to the band.  Everything that needed to be warm and analog (Steve Howe's guitar and Jon Anderson's vocals, for example) is presented richly, and everything that needed to be well-defined (Bill Bruford's drums and Chris Squire's bass) stands out in the mix.  And everything that was there just for accompaniment (sorry, Tony) was parried into the mix nicely, where it is neither swallowed nor oppressive. <br /> <br />The music on this release is a departure from anything the band had ever attempted before it.  Gone is any shred of the Beatles, bereft is the album of any covers, and we can all fondly say goodbye to the awkward arrangements and poor final production that plagued the previous releases.  This album sets the stage for the prolific and magnificent work the band would produce through and including the 1977 'Going for the One' release.  On 'The Yes Album,'the band had finally found its core sound and its comfort zone.  'The Yes Album' is dominated by four long epic suites, which are all structured in a similar manner.  And yet, within each distinct work, there is myriad experimentation and instrumental musing.  However, there is an underlying structure that keeps the work from passing beyond the realm of interest.  The two shorter works, including a showcase by Steve Howe, serve as intermissions in a sense between the larger, grander works. <br /> <br />Now for a detailed description of each track: <br /> <br />1. \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" - Right from the onset, with the bass/drum pattern, one knows he or she is hearing something grand and spectacular.  This pattern is repeated twice, and then the distorted Hammond organ overlays this bass/drum pattern as it perpetuates and modulates keys.

There are quiet passages, long solo passages, and intense, layered vocal passages.  The lyrics seem to mean very little, even after one listens to the song many times, but there we have the magic of Yes: The lyrics don't have to mean anything at all, so long as the bond between them and the music remains sound.  And Jon Anderson was a master of engineering this bond, and the results are positively beautiful.  Ladies and gentlemen, this music is the definition of progressive rock: It transcends the here and now and the mundane, and transports the listener to a world where the rules don't always apply, and where all that matters is the music. <br /> <br />2. \\"Clap\\" (NOT \\"The Clap\\") - This is Steve Howe's showcase tune.  It's a live track, recorded in a very warm-sounding and reverberant location.  I am not a guitarist, and by virtue, I tend to become bored with these sorts of things.  It is the same with \\"Mood for a Day\\" on the next release, 'Fragile.'  It is such that I am not qualified to really evaluate this song musically, though of course in the technical sense it is dazzling.  Steve Howe, in my opinion, is one of the two greatest guitarists in the history of the art.  Therefore, he has every right to be rather annoyed that people keep calling his song \\"The Clap\\" (even the record producers!). <br /> <br />3. \\"Starship Trooper\\" - This song is structured a little differently from the first epic.  This piece comes in three distinct movements, \\"Life Seeker,\\" \\"Disillusion,\\" and \\"Wurm\\" (Wurm is a glacial valley in Europe and might be the genesis of the name of this movement, the instrumentation of which indeed conjures images of fjords and such).  The tale is again told through cryptic poetry bound to its music, and the first movement is anchored by Squire's trademark bass and Howe's indispensable electric guitar.  The second movement begins abruptly with Howe's frantic acoustic guitar strumming and a different vocal melody.  An innovative bridge returns to the first theme before the final movement, an instrumental, begins.  This movement gains in intensity before a truly phenomenal, forward-miced Howe solo rips into the open musical space and crowns the fadeout. <br /> <br />4. \\"I've Seen All Good People\\" - This is the infamous single from the album, and behind \\"Owner Of A Lonely Heart\\" and \\"Roundabout,\\" it is probably Yes's most well-known song.  A double-movement work, the song begins with the skeletal sounding \\"Your Move,\\" possessed of an insistent thumping double-strummed bass note, anchored by the bass drum.  The heavy vocal harmonies that begin this piece are a capella, and the instrumentation is mostly acoustic (there are even recorders).

When among giants, however, a mere mortal--no matter how tall--just doesn't measure up.  A good effort, nonetheless,on a rather substandard song. <br /> <br />6. \\"Perpetual Change\\" - This is the sixth and final epic on the original album.  It basically follows the same form as the others, and includes many of the same elements that make the other three great.  The beginning is a very intense introduction, akin to the one on the later \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" on `Fragile.'  Then, in an almost jazzy fashion, the actual sung part of the song begins very softly, building gradually to the words \\"perpetual change.\\"  This pattern repeats several times throughout the song, and then a completely new section (the chorus) begins, with Jon Anderson singing up in the stratosphere as he usually does, the melody triumphant and uplifting.  After this sequence from the first theme to the chorus is repeated twice, a totally new section begins in stark juxtaposition.  This section, an instrumental, makes use of some advanced panning and other studio trickery, and it brilliantly weaves themes from the entire song together.  A return to the pattern from before, and then a unique fadeout sequence complete this piece, a very strong finish to a very strong album. <br /> <br />Overall, this is where I would recommend new Yes fans to start with the band.  Everything you need to get a solid impression of what the band was all about is right here.  And yet, this album doesn't have training wheels; there's nothing less impressive about this album then, say, `Fragile' or `Close to the Edge' (all right, nothing really compares to `Close,' but that's a given).  Basically, this album is the most accessible of the first three classic Yes albums, and it's where the band really found its characteristic sound.  It's always a good idea to start at the beginning, so I would start with `The Yes Album,' then go from there.  And, on a broader scale, I would recommend this album to just about anyone in the world, really.  There are some things that were just destined to be classics.  `The Yes Album' is one of them.
B00005K1ZG|5.0|The year is 1971, and Atlantic records has reached a critical, if unspoken, decision in regards to the promising British band Yes: If the band's third studio attempt follows in the wake of the past two, then the label has no choice but to drop the band.  This sort of ultimatum abounds often in the music business, as bands fail initially to meet sales expectations.  It happened with Kansas after their third album, 'Masque' (1975), much in the same way it happened with Yes earlier in the 1970s. <br /> <br />Luckily, neither band surrendered to the tremendous pressure generated by their precarious contract positions, and both bands produced successful albums when it really counted. <br /> <br />What follows is a description of Yes' triumph, 'The Yes Album.' <br /> <br />Something clicked in the group between the previous 'Time and a Word' release and this one.  That something, many believe, was the exodus of Peter Banks and the inauguration of supreme guitar talent Steve Howe.  The lineup, then, stood as follows: Jon Anderson on lead vocals, Bill Bruford on drums, Steve Howe on guitar, Tony Kaye on keyboards, and Chris Squire on bass, with Howe and Squire contributing their backup vocals where needed.  Howe brought to the table something the band sorely lacked: a lead guitarist.  Banks was decent at what he did, but he was not strong enough by any means to carry the band.  Steve Howe, however, was a master of his instrument, and it really shows on this album--previously almost unheard, the guitar takes the center stage as the solo instrument par excellence on 'The Yes Album.' <br /> <br />On top of his game also was every other member of the band.  Tony Kaye, while never even close to Rick Wakeman (who would succeed Kaye on the following year's 'Fragile' release), evolved into something of a competent keyboardist on this album.  At very least he left behind the cheesy, dated, '60s style organ registrations in favor of the timeless, distorted Hammond sound that definesclassic and progressive rock.  Bill Bruford stopped playing like a typical, generic drummer, and began asserting himself for the truly innovative magician he is.  Chris Squire finally dropped once and for all the psychedelic wah-wah effect, turned up the treble on his Rickenbacker, and what do you know: The celebrated, trademark Squire bass sound was born.  And Jon Anderson sang better than ever, both clearer and with greater tonal accuracy.  Also, and perhaps most prudently, Anderson made the transition from writing pedestrian lyrics to painting images with words and poetry, while relying on the music itself to complete the pieces and affect the flow.  This high-brow, esoteric lyrical content--the meaning of which is completed by the instrumentation--is one of the defining qualities of Yes, and is one of the many reasons why Yes is both a musicians' and an intellectuals' band. <br /> <br />That having been said, the \\"sixth member\\" of the band, producer Eddie Offord, really saved the day on this album.  He sculpted what we now identify as the \\"Yes sound,\\" that extremely clean and precise timbre that is unique to the band.  Everything that needed to be warm and analog (Steve Howe's guitar and Jon Anderson's vocals, for example) is presented richly, and everything that needed to be well-defined (Bill Bruford's drums and Chris Squire's bass) stands out in the mix.  And everything that was there just for accompaniment (sorry, Tony) was parried into the mix nicely, where it is neither swallowed nor oppressive. <br /> <br />The music on this release is a departure from anything the band had ever attempted before it.  Gone is any shred of the Beatles, bereft is the album of any covers, and we can all fondly say goodbye to the awkward arrangements and poor final production that plagued the previous releases.  This album sets the stage for the prolific and magnificent work the band would produce through and including the 1977 'Going for the One' release.  On 'The Yes Album,'the band had finally found its core sound and its comfort zone.  'The Yes Album' is dominated by four long epic suites, which are all structured in a similar manner.  And yet, within each distinct work, there is myriad experimentation and instrumental musing.  However, there is an underlying structure that keeps the work from passing beyond the realm of interest.  The two shorter works, including a showcase by Steve Howe, serve as intermissions in a sense between the larger, grander works. <br /> <br />Now for a detailed description of each track: <br /> <br />1. \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" - Right from the onset, with the bass/drum pattern, one knows he or she is hearing something grand and spectacular.  This pattern is repeated twice, and then the distorted Hammond organ overlays this bass/drum pattern as it perpetuates and modulates keys.  Enter Steve Howe, with his trademark guitar, which those listening to the album in 1971 heard for the first time.  He plays a virtuosic passage right over this growing bed of instrumentation, and in that instant a band is born. <br /> <br />The piece meanders gloriously through numerous vocal and instrumental escapades, never waning in interest or intensity.  There are quiet passages, long solo passages, and intense, layered vocal passages.  The lyrics seem to mean very little, even after one listens to the song many times, but there we have the magic of Yes: The lyrics don't have to mean anything at all, so long as the bond between them and the music remains sound.  And Jon Anderson was a master of engineering this bond, and the results are positively beautiful.  Ladies and gentlemen, this music is the definition of progressive rock: It transcends the here and now and the mundane, and transports the listener to a world where the rules don't always apply, and where all that matters is the music. <br /> <br />2. \\"Clap\\" (NOT \\"The Clap\\") - This is Steve Howe's showcase tune.  It's a live track, recorded in a very warm-sounding and reverberant location.  I am not a guitarist, and by virtue, I tend to become bored with these sorts of things.  It is the same with \\"Mood for a Day\\" on the next release, 'Fragile.'  It is such that I am not qualified to really evaluate this song musically, though of course in the technical sense it is dazzling.  Steve Howe, in my opinion, is one of the two greatest guitarists in the history of the art.  Therefore, he has every right to be rather annoyed that people keep calling his song \\"The Clap\\" (even the record producers!). <br /> <br />3. \\"Starship Trooper\\" - This song is structured a little differently from the first epic.  This piece comes in three distinct movements, \\"Life Seeker,\\" \\"Disillusion,\\" and \\"Wurm\\" (Wurm is a glacial valley in Europe and might be the genesis of the name of this movement, the instrumentation of which indeed conjures images of fjords and such).  The tale is again told through cryptic poetry bound to its music, and the first movement is anchored by Squire's trademark bass and Howe's indispensable electric guitar.  The second movement begins abruptly with Howe's frantic acoustic guitar strumming and a different vocal melody.  An innovative bridge returns to the first theme before the final movement, an instrumental, begins.  This movement gains in intensity before a truly phenomenal, forward-miced Howe solo rips into the open musical space and crowns the fadeout. <br /> <br />4. \\"I've Seen All Good People\\" - This is the infamous single from the album, and behind \\"Owner Of A Lonely Heart\\" and \\"Roundabout,\\" it is probably Yes's most well-known song.  A double-movement work, the song begins with the skeletal sounding \\"Your Move,\\" possessed of an insistent thumping double-strummed bass note, anchored by the bass drum.  The heavy vocal harmonies that begin this piece are a capella, and the instrumentation is mostly acoustic (there are even recorders).  Just before the climax of this movement, Tony Kaye plays what is probably the most significantpassage of his entire career with the band when his massive, distorted Hammond enters perfectly on cue to produce a positively gravitational effect.  At the end of this sequence, there is a swell on the organ until it seems as though one's head might explode, and then a ringing silence.  Then begins the second movement, an energetic rocker called \\"All Good People.\\"  The same words, \\"I've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satisfied I'm on my way,\\" are repeated over and over again, the music building in intensity, until the final fadeout, where the band--complimented by that blasting organ--sings the phrase in a continually descending tonality each time until the fadeout is complete. <br /> <br />Despite this rather orgasmic description of the song, of the four epics on this album, this one is my least favorite.  I will always remember it affectionately as the first Yes song I ever heard and wanted to own, and that is perhaps why I don't like it so well as I did in the past: I believe I am simply tired of it.  And of the four epic tracks, this is the only one you will ever hear on the radio anymore.  And so progressive rock dies a little more by the hands of the media conglomerate who have, since about 1974, acted in concert to achieve just that end: the death of progressive rock. <br /> <br />They will never succeed. <br /> <br />5. \\"A Venture\\" - This is the second shorter track from the album, and another I am not really qualified to describe.  It could be because I really don't like it very much that I am unable to comment.  Certainly this would contribute to an explanation for why I don't even remember how it goes, only that I never liked it.  I vaguely remember that it had a pastoral feel and that it was piano-dominated.  Kaye actually wasn't a bad keyboardist overall, and in any band other than Yes he would have seemed very good.  When among giants, however, a mere mortal--no matter how tall--just doesn't measure up.  A good effort, nonetheless,on a rather substandard song. <br /> <br />6. \\"Perpetual Change\\" - This is the sixth and final epic on the original album.  It basically follows the same form as the others, and includes many of the same elements that make the other three great.  The beginning is a very intense introduction, akin to the one on the later \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" on `Fragile.'  Then, in an almost jazzy fashion, the actual sung part of the song begins very softly, building gradually to the words \\"perpetual change.\\"  This pattern repeats several times throughout the song, and then a completely new section (the chorus) begins, with Jon Anderson singing up in the stratosphere as he usually does, the melody triumphant and uplifting.  After this sequence from the first theme to the chorus is repeated twice, a totally new section begins in stark juxtaposition.  This section, an instrumental, makes use of some advanced panning and other studio trickery, and it brilliantly weaves themes from the entire song together.  A return to the pattern from before, and then a unique fadeout sequence complete this piece, a very strong finish to a very strong album. <br /> <br />Overall, this is where I would recommend new Yes fans to start with the band.  Everything you need to get a solid impression of what the band was all about is right here.  And yet, this album doesn't have training wheels; there's nothing less impressive about this album then, say, `Fragile' or `Close to the Edge' (all right, nothing really compares to `Close,' but that's a given).  Basically, this album is the most accessible of the first three classic Yes albums, and it's where the band really found its characteristic sound.  It's always a good idea to start at the beginning, so I would start with `The Yes Album,' then go from there.  And, on a broader scale, I would recommend this album to just about anyone in the world, really.  There are some things that were just destined to be classics.  `The Yes Album' is one of them.
B00005LK1N|5.0|There were two albums released by Yes in the year 1972--the stellar `Close to the Edge' and this earlier effort, `Fragile.'  Yes--at this point consisting of Jon Anderson on lead vocals, Bill Bruford on drums, Steve Howe on guitars, Chris Squire on bass, and the newly-recruited Rick Wakeman on keyboards--had just scored a decent breakthrough with their third album, `The Yes Album,' in the previous year.  They had actually broken the charts in America, and they had finally reached and fortified what would be their characteristic sound in the years and albums to come. <br /> <br />So where does `Fragile' fit into all that?  The original nine tracks on `Fragile' are widely considered quintessential progressive rock, a template from which myriad later acts would spawn.  From start to finish, `Fragile' plays like well-oiled machinery (even with its occasional catches and blips), and its main material--the longer suites, mostly--demonstrates the level of maturity the band had ultimately achieved by this time in their collective career.  Oh, and `Fragile' also brings to the table a little something called \\"Roundabout,\\" which may well be the band's most famous song ever. <br /> <br />What are we waiting for?  The songs (in detail): <br /> <br />1. \\"Roundabout\\" - Well, well.  Do I really need to comment upon this one?  Unlike many popular, therefore overplayed songs, this one just doesn't get old.  Play it as many times as you like, and it still captivates.  Right from the onset, with Steve Howe's guitar harmonics, one can hear the innovation and compositional brilliance of the band.  And as the introduction moves on into the body of the piece, an irresistible lick makes itself heard again and again, though it never grows tiresome.  The middle section of the piece, with its fantastically arranged vocals, inspires pure awe, and the soft and pensive section which follows adds a much-appreciated dynamic contrast.  The Mellotron flutes are particularly nice, though of course they only play a few poly-chords.  What follows is one of Rick Wakeman's most spectacular solo escapades (though of course the one in \\"Close to the Edge\\" is his supreme solo effort), a repetition of earlier parts of the song, and the riveting conclusion, replete in layered, overdubbed vocals and presented with minimal backing to enhance the effect.  A simple flourish by Steve Howe ends the piece in understatement.  In a word, stunning. <br /> <br />2. \\"Cans And Brahms\\" - This is Rick Wakeman's showcase song on the album (each member gets a chance to show off in solo).  It's not bad, though it's not original.  It's basically an arrangement of various Brahms melodies, played on slightly unconventional instrumentation.  The work demonstrates for all to see Wakeman's peerless technical ability, but I do wish he (or the band in care of him) would have come up with something original.  Still, though, it's short enough that it goes by before it overstays its welcome. <br /> <br />3. \\"We Have Heaven\\" - This is Jon Anderson's chance to shine.  Here, in a vivid, multilayered arrangement, he sings a bunch of nonsense, albeit in impressive fashion.  Though I respect the tremendous skill required to have laid down such a track, I personally find this work insufferably annoying and repetitive.  It did not make it onto my iPod. <br /> <br />4. \\"South Side Of The Sky\\" - Ah, here we are with the second of the epic pieces.  This one is a great deal darker and more angular than \\"Roundabout,\\" and its lyrics allegedly deal with a failed Antarctic expedition where the explorers end up dying.  Though with Yes, you can never be sure.  Even so, this song is a true masterpiece of instrumentation, beginning with a brumal blast of synthesized Antarctic wind (apparently previous editions of the album also included footsteps, which have now been moved to the end of the previous track, where I have never heard them because I can't stand to listen to the third track to completion), and--in that weirdYes-esque manner--it rocks.  The middle section is a dark, piano-dominated piece of disjointed yet substantial clockwork, culminating in a neutral vocal section which might be representative of the gates of heaven opening for the doomed explorers.  After a return to the motifs from the beginning of the song, the work ends on a fadeout into the same howling wind with which it began. <br /> <br />5. \\"Five Per Cent For Nothing\\" - It might take you longer to read this description than it would for you to listen to the song.  It's really that short--around 35 seconds or so.  Bruford's showcase, it's a little drum pattern, repeated twice, with instrumentation from the rest of the band thrown in for good measure.  I guess they figured 35 seconds is about five percent of a song, so that's how they arrived at this title.  It makes a nice little introduction to the next track, so it works. <br /> <br />6. \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" - This is the infamous pop monster that, nonetheless, maintains the progressive feel so integral to Yes.  It's pleasant to listen to, and it's one of the shorter of Yes's full-band involvement songs up to this point.  The beginning line, with Steve Howe's expert guitar work running in parallel across the stereo field, is a sound to behold.  Once Chris Squire enters the fray, things get really interesting.  This song has one of the most enduring bass lines ever conceived, even among Yes songs.  Squire is among the most innovative of bassists, and his trademark, treble-heavy tone really helps the mood of this piece.  And, of course, Jon Anderson is up in the stratosphere singing away about nothing.  But then, Yes is music where, though very pretty in their own right, the lyrics are unimportant.  Anderson's lyrics paint pictures of emotion, they don't broadcast it of their own volition.  In this he was one of music's greatest poets. <br /> <br />7. \\"The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus)\\" - Here's a shocker: All the instrumentation that isn't drums is performed by Chris Squire's bass.  What an original concept!  If only the band had expounded upon what they had discovered here, they could really have come up with some interesting material.  Even so, this is by far one of the most interesting of tracks from `Fragile.'  \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" segues into this track, so \\"The Fish\\" is akin to a separate movement of the previous track.  Oh, and yes, they do sing the words \\"Schindleria Praematurus\\" at the end of the song.  Why?  I don't know.  Obviously it's the Latin name for a fish, but as to why it was chosen to name this song, I have no clue. <br /> <br />8. \\"Mood For A Day\\" - It's Howe's turn up to bat, with this showcase song.  I never though much of \\"Clap\\" (often mislabeled \\"The Clap\\" to the horror and extreme annoyance of Steve Howe), and I suppose that holds true for this song as well.  Steve Howe is a brilliant guitarist, probably one of the two best in the history of the art, and were I myself a guitarist I might find this track wholly more interesting.  As a keyboardist, I probably listen to \\"Cans And Brahms\\" a great deal more than most `Fragile' listeners.  There's nothing wrong with \\"Mood For A Day;\\" I'm just not qualified to evaluate it objectively. <br /> <br />9. \\"Heart Of The Sunrise\\" - Ah.  Bliss.  Here we have the ultimate closer to an exemplary album.  Beginning with a bang with an intriguing instrumental jam, this theme is then explored for two-and-a-half minutes before the song begins, very softly, yet never relenting until it reaches its climax.  And what a climax it is!  Anderson sings a high D (the one just above tuning A-440) which, when immersed in a chord is nothing special, naked and at the high point of a song is nothing short of breathtaking (even though he doesn't hold it and it sounds a little forced).  Jon's voice can go much, much higher, but this particular note is so well placed that it says, commandingly, that the listener has arrived at the ultimate climax of the song. <br /> <br/>It's just too bad that this isn't really the end.  There is a return of that energetic instrumental jam, then a pregnant silence.  Then, after about six seconds or so, a reprise of that ghastly third track, \\"We Have Heaven\\" bursts out of nowhere and fades out the track.  The idea was brilliant, but since I hated the song the first time, I really wasn't particularly thrilled to hear it again, especially tacked on to one of the best songs on the album.  At least that pause is long enough to where I can just skip the ending.  I considered altering the track before putting it on my iPod (basically removing that ending section), but I couldn't bring myself to desecrate a progressive rock masterpiece in that manner, even if I don't agree with the way it was arranged. <br /> <br />Overall, I would recommend `Fragile' to just about anyone, particularly those new to Yes.  In this instance, there is nothing wrong with this release that would make it \\"for newbies.\\"  On the contrary, this album offers a vivid picture of just what made Yes the masterful progressive rock band it was, in a manner that is akin to on-the-job training.  This album was made to make music, not to indoctrinate or placate fans.  That, in part, is what makes Yes so special: They made music first, and radio-friendly music only if it turned out that way. <br /> <br />Thank God for `Fragile,' or there might never have been a `Close to the Edge.'
B000002J1B|4.0|Following on the heels of an album many attribute to the collapse of progressive rock ('Tales from Topographic Oceans' in 1973), Yes sought to heal the gap it had driven between its fans--some loved 'Tales,' and others thought it was bombastic and (a classic pun) over the edge.  Critics saw 'Tales' as an opportunity to do something they had been waiting to do forever: demonstrate to the mere common man their birthright superiority by collectively dashing the whole of progressive rock into oblivion. <br /> <br />They successfully destroyed the further exploration and cultivation of the art form, but not the spirit of its followers.  It was in this climate, though, that Yes's 1974 release, 'Relayer,' was somewhat ignored and shunned.  The band did not succeed outright in reuniting its fans (three years later, the release of 'Going for the One' came much closer to this ideal) with 'Relayer,' but they did set down a truly progressive album, ripe with fresh ideas and a totally new direction for the band. <br /> <br />This new direction was fostered somewhat by the recent lineup changes (the exodus of drummer Bill Bruford after 'Close to the Edge' and keyboardist Rick Wakeman's departure after 'Tales').  Drummer Alan White was called in for 'Tales,' and to fill Wakeman's shoes, Swiss-born keyboardist Patrick Moraz was commissioned well into the 'Relayer' project.  White, now a seasoned member of the band, gained the confidence to give his best performance on 'Relayer.'  And Moraz, a fresh addition, offered a completely different playing style than Wakeman.  While Wakeman was steeped in classical, Moraz was much more influenced by jazz. <br /> <br />Now that I have given the facts, it's time for the evaluation segment.  I must respectfully disagree with many of the reviewers of this album in that I personally do not like Patrick Moraz's work.  Considering the matter at length, I find the parts about the album I consistently dislike are the keyboard lines.  The synthesizerprogramming is universally awful; most of the time it sounds like helium escaping from a balloon.  Also, Moraz uses almost all synthesizers, the Mellotron is often swallowed in the mix, and the Hammond organ is almost nonexistent.  The latter two are things I miss from the band's earlier albums; even Tony Kaye on the very early albums was proficient in the usage of the Hammond organ.  The Hammond, I believe, was integral to the band's sound.  And Rick Wakeman's classical sensibilities kept his contributions within the bounds of reason, whereas Moraz's work is rather grating and irritating.  Finally, Wakeman's synthesizer programming--though sometimes staid--had a warm and organic feel to it, something which I sorely miss on 'Relayer.'  While it is true that this album is indeed one of noticibly less absolute structure than the previous efforts, and while certainly its sound is rougher and harder, I think some sort of solid base was needed, and the keyboards would have been where I would have placed it. <br /> <br />As far as Alan White, I agree with most people (including Bill Bruford himself): He just doesn't quite measure up to Bruford, though he is very good.  Of course some of that may well be the somewhat flat production of this album (which was recorded in some sort of mobile studio), but it seems as though the life and breath the drumming had when Bruford was at the sticks has vanished in favor of a more \\"backseat\\" style of drumming.  The remarkable thing about Yes is that, on the three albums from 1971 ('The Yes Album') to 1972 ('Fragile' and 'Close to the Edge'), no member of the band ever served simply as background.  Most bands subjugate the rhythm section to a mere continuo, but not Yes.  Each member of the band stood out at some point or other in the music.  White, for all his efforts, sort of fades into the background in a way that Bill Bruford never did. <br /> <br />The remaining members of the band perform brilliantly as ever.  Jon Anderson's vocalsare truly first-rate, Steve Howe gives what is perhaps his most daring technical performance all throughout the album, and Chris Squire's trademark Rickenbacker--muted a little in this album--is present as ever.  Overall the musicianship of the band is sterling, perhaps better than at any point or lineup in the band's existence.  I will never dispute that 'Relayer' is the most technically-advanced Yes album, and I will venture to argue that it is the most technically-advanced album in all of music. <br /> <br />But technical skill, dazzling as it may be, is not everything in music.  <br /> <br />As far as the album itself, I wouldn't proclaim as some have that it is Yes's greatest achievement.  On the whole, it's somewhat less musical than most Yes music and a great deal denser and harder to appreciate.  It's also somewhat darker lyrically than the generally sunny material put out by the band in the past.  The first track is by far the best, and the next two just don't strike me as anywhere near as brilliant as some people find them.  In fact, I find the second track nearly unlistenable, especially the frenzied \\"Cha cha cha!\\" part near the end.  It is for the comparatively lacking status of these two tracks, along with the awful keyboards, that I only give the release four stars.  There is brilliant material on 'Relayer,' but I believe some of it could have been presented and developed much better. <br /> <br />For the most part, the entire album is a clear departure from the earlier releases.  It does not entirely lack structure as some people might at first believe; rather, the structure of each track is held together much more loosely then in the conventional sense and mostly by the format of the song, not the actual music itself.  This will take some acclimation, and all through this album one perceives the opposing forces of greatness and insanity battling it out, each with the ultimate goal of prevailing.  Throughout, a tenuous balance between the two is upheld. <br /> <br />I will now comment exclusively upon the first track, \\"The Gates of Delirium.\\" <br /> <br />This song will take a great deal of listening in order to appreciate.  Most people who first listen to it will find themselves wishing it to be over around about the ten-minute mark.  Of all the Yes I have sampled (everything from the debut up through this album, and then some of their later material), \\"Gates\\" by far took me the longest time to like.  And, unlike any other Yes song I have ever heard, I utterly hated \\"Gates\\" the first three or four times I tried it.  It is the wildest, most cacophonic piece of music ever recorded, I venture to say. <br /> <br />So why did I keep listening to it?  Well, I did spend a decent amount of money on the album, and if I had just left it on the rack collecting dust, all I would have had to show for it would have been perhaps one of the prettiest album covers Roger Dean ever produced.  Also, I refused to believe something that appealed so little to me could possibly have generated so much acclaim among progressive rock fans.  Obviously the music was very difficult to get into, and I decided to confront the challenge with repeated listening. <br /> <br />I won, so to speak, because I have discovered the magic of this track.  The comparison that is made most often is between \\"The Gates of Delirium\\" and \\"Close to the Edge.\\"  My opinion on the matter has changed with repeated listening to both, and I must now submit that I honestly cannot decide which of these phenominal epics is better.  I suppose it depends upon the day on which you ask the question, so for all practical purposes, to me it's a tie. <br /> <br />\\"Gates\\" carries the listener through one of the most engrossing musical journeys ever composed.  The basic story is that of a war, and then the silence which follows the fighting.  The story is told through both the words and the music, which is a trademark facet of Yes music since 'Close to the Edge.'  The ending sequence, excised as the single \\"Soon,\\" is breathtakingly beautiful.  It only really shines with all its might when absorbed just after the brain-shattering cacophony of the \\"War of the Instrumentalists\\" that comes just before it in the music.  After that intensity, one feels as though he had actually been part of the battle, and now that it's over, the sun is shining down in vivid shafts through the clouds.  And, up in the sky, the gates of Heaven are opening and spreading eternal warmth and beauty over the war-torn landscape.  The delirium of war is replaced with the glimmering, soul-fulfilling advent of inner peace.  It will give you chills. <br /> <br /> <br />For the benefit of those viewing this particular item's page with intent to purchase this particular edition of the album, you should know that 'Relayer' was re-remastered in 2003 by Rhino Records.  The Rhino edition comes in a digipack with slipcover and includes bonus tracks.  Though I have not personally compared the two, the sound quality of the 2003 edition allegedly far outstrips that of this 1994 Atlantic edition. <br /> <br />All in all, this album is experiencing a revival insofar as appreciation.  And I believe it deserves it; it was underrated in the beginning, and it is now finally seeing its due.  However, I would recommend 'Relayer' to only a very select group of people.  Devoted Yes fans (or is it Yesfans) probably already have this album in one form or another, and if not, what are you waiting for?  I would definitely not start with 'Relayer' if you are new to the band or to progressive rock in general.  'The Yes Album' (1971), 'Fragile' (1972), and 'Close to the Edge' (1972) (and in that order) would be your best bet.  If you like what you hear, you will (eventually) like 'Relayer.'  Basically, this is a fans' album.  Casual listeners probably shouldn't waste their time on this one.  I'm not trying to be condescending; I'm just trying to save you some time and money.
B000002J1C|5.0|The year is 1971, and Atlantic records has reached a critical, if unspoken, decision in regards to the promising British band Yes: If the band's third studio attempt follows in the wake of the past two, then the label has no choice but to drop the band.  This sort of ultimatum abounds often in the music business, as bands fail initially to meet sales expectations.  It happened with Kansas after their third album, 'Masque' (1975), much in the same way it happened with Yes earlier in the 1970s.    Luckily, neither band surrendered to the tremendous pressure generated by their precarious contract positions, and both bands produced successful albums when it really counted.    What follows is a description of Yes' triumph, 'The Yes Album.'    Something clicked in the group between the previous 'Time and a Word' release and this one.  That something, many believe, was the exodus of Peter Banks and the inauguration of supreme guitar talent Steve Howe.  The lineup, then, stood as follows: Jon Anderson on lead vocals, Bill Bruford on drums, Steve Howe on guitar, Tony Kaye on keyboards, and Chris Squire on bass, with Howe and Squire contributing their backup vocals where needed.  Howe brought to the table something the band sorely lacked: a lead guitarist.  Banks was decent at what he did, but he was not strong enough by any means to carry the band.  Steve Howe, however, was a master of his instrument, and it really shows on this album--previously almost unheard, the guitar takes the center stage as the solo instrument par excellence on 'The Yes Album.'    On top of his game also was every other member of the band.  Tony Kaye, while never even close to Rick Wakeman (who would succeed Kaye on the following year's 'Fragile' release), evolved into something of a competent keyboardist on this album.  At very least he left behind the cheesy, dated, '60s style organ registrations in favor of the timeless, distorted Hammond sound that defines classic and progressive rock.  Bill Bruford stopped playing like a typical, generic drummer, and began asserting himself for the truly innovative magician he is.  Chris Squire finally dropped once and for all the psychedelic wah-wah effect, turned up the treble on his Rickenbacker, and what do you know: The celebrated, trademark Squire bass sound was born.  And Jon Anderson sang better than ever, both clearer and with greater tonal accuracy.  Also, and perhaps most prudently, Anderson made the transition from writing pedestrian lyrics to painting images with words and poetry, while relying on the music itself to complete the pieces and affect the flow.  This high-brow, esoteric lyrical content--the meaning of which is completed by the instrumentation--is one of the defining qualities of Yes, and is one of the many reasons why Yes is both a musicians' and an intellectuals' band.    That having been said, the \\"sixth member\\" of the band, producer Eddie Offord, really saved the day on this album.  He sculpted what we now identify as the \\"Yes sound,\\" that extremely clean and precise timbre that is unique to the band.  Everything that needed to be warm and analog (Steve Howe's guitar and Jon Anderson's vocals, for example) is presented richly, and everything that needed to be well-defined (Bill Bruford's drums and Chris Squire's bass) stands out in the mix.  And everything that was there just for accompaniment (sorry, Tony) was parried into the mix nicely, where it is neither swallowed nor oppressive.    The music on this release is a departure from anything the band had ever attempted before it.  Gone is any shred of the Beatles, bereft is the album of any covers, and we can all fondly say goodbye to the awkward arrangements and poor final production that plagued the previous releases.  This album sets the stage for the prolific and magnificent work the band would produce through and including the 1977 'Going for the One' release.  On 'The Yes Album,' the band had finally found its core sound and its comfort zone.  'The Yes Album' is dominated by four long epic suites, which are all structured in a similar manner.  And yet, within each distinct work, there is myriad experimentation and instrumental musing.  However, there is an underlying structure that keeps the work from passing beyond the realm of interest.  The two shorter works, including a showcase by Steve Howe, serve as intermissions in a sense between the larger, grander works.    Now for a detailed description of each track:    1. \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" - Right from the onset, with the bass/drum pattern, one knows he or she is hearing something grand and spectacular.  This pattern is repeated twice, and then the distorted Hammond organ overlays this bass/drum pattern as it perpetuates and modulates keys.  Enter Steve Howe, with his trademark guitar, which those listening to the album in 1971 heard for the first time.  He plays a virtuosic passage right over this growing bed of instrumentation, and in that instant a band is born.    The piece meanders gloriously through numerous vocal and instrumental escapades, never waning in interest or intensity.  There are quiet passages, long solo passages, and intense, layered vocal passages.  The lyrics seem to mean very little, even after one listens to the song many times, but there we have the magic of Yes: The lyrics don't have to mean anything at all, so long as the bond between them and the music remains sound.  And Jon Anderson was a master of engineering this bond, and the results are positively beautiful.  Ladies and gentlemen, this music is the definition of progressive rock: It transcends the here and now and the mundane, and transports the listener to a world where the rules don't always apply, and where all that matters is the music.    2. \\"Clap\\" (NOT \\"The Clap\\") - This is Steve Howe's showcase tune.  It's a live track, recorded in a very warm-sounding and reverberant location.  I am not a guitarist, and by virtue, I tend to become bored with these sorts ofthings.  It is the same with \\"Mood for a Day\\" on the next release, 'Fragile.'  It is such that I am not qualified to really evaluate this song musically, though of course in the technical sense it is dazzling.  Steve Howe, in my opinion, is one of the two greatest guitarists in the history of the art.  Therefore, he has every right to be rather annoyed that people keep calling his song \\"The Clap\\" (even the record producers!).    3. \\"Starship Trooper\\" - This song is structured a little differently from the first epic.  This piece comes in three distinct movements, \\"Life Seeker,\\" \\"Disillusion,\\" and \\"Wurm\\" (Wurm is a glacial valley in Europe and might be the genesis of the name of this movement, the instrumentation of which indeed conjures images of fjords and such).  The tale is again told through cryptic poetry bound to its music, and the first movement is anchored by Squire's trademark bass and Howe's indispensable electric guitar.  The second movement begins abruptly with Howe's frantic acoustic guitar strumming and a different vocal melody.  An innovative bridge returns to the first theme before the final movement, an instrumental, begins.  This movement gains in intensity before a truly phenomenal, forward-miced Howe solo rips into the open musical space and crowns the fadeout.    4. \\"I've Seen All Good People\\" - This is the infamous single from the album, and behind \\"Owner Of A Lonely Heart\\" and \\"Roundabout,\\" it is probably Yes's most well-known song.  A double-movement work, the song begins with the skeletal sounding \\"Your Move,\\" possessed of an insistent thumping double-strummed bass note, anchored by the bass drum.  The heavy vocal harmonies that begin this piece are a capella, and the instrumentation is mostly acoustic (there are even recorders).  Just before the climax of this movement, Tony Kaye plays what is probably the most significant passage of his entire career with the band when his massive, distorted Hammond enters perfectly on cue to produce a positively gravitational effect.  At the end of this sequence, there is a swell on the organ until it seems as though one's head might explode, and then a ringing silence.  Then begins the second movement, an energetic rocker called \\"All Good People.\\"  The same words, \\"I've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satisfied I'm on my way,\\" are repeated over and over again, the music building in intensity, until the final fadeout, where the band--complimented by that blasting organ--sings the phrase in a continually descending tonality each time until the fadeout is complete.    Despite this rather orgasmic description of the song, of the four epics on this album, this one is my least favorite.  I will always remember it affectionately as the first Yes song I ever heard and wanted to own, and that is perhaps why I don't like it so well as I did in the past: I believe I am simply tired of it.  And of the four epic tracks, this is the only one you will ever hear on the radio anymore.  And so progressive rock dies a little more by the hands of the media conglomerate who have, since about 1974, acted in concert to achieve just that end: the death of progressive rock.    They will never succeed.    5. \\"A Venture\\" - This is the second shorter track from the album, and another I am not really qualified to describe.  It could be because I really don't like it very much that I am unable to comment.  Certainly this would contribute to an explanation for why I don't even remember how it goes, only that I never liked it.  I vaguely remember that it had a pastoral feel and that it was piano-dominated.  Kaye actually wasn't a bad keyboardist overall, and in any band other than Yes he would have seemed very good.  When among giants, however, a mere mortal--no matter how tall--just doesn't measure up.  A good effort, nonetheless, on a rather substandard song.    6. \\"Perpetual Change\\" - This is the sixth and final epic on the original album.  It basically follows the same formas the others, and includes many of the same elements that make the other three great.  The beginning is a very intense introduction, akin to the one on the later \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" on `Fragile.'  Then, in an almost jazzy fashion, the actual sung part of the song begins very softly, building gradually to the words \\"perpetual change.\\"  This pattern repeats several times throughout the song, and then a completely new section (the chorus) begins, with Jon Anderson singing up in the stratosphere as he usually does, the melody triumphant and uplifting.  After this sequence from the first theme to the chorus is repeated twice, a totally new section begins in stark juxtaposition.  This section, an instrumental, makes use of some advanced panning and other studio trickery, and it brilliantly weaves themes from the entire song together.  A return to the pattern from before, and then a unique fadeout sequence complete this piece, a very strong finish to a very strong album.    For the benefit of those who are viewing this item's page with the intent of purchasing this particular edition, I feel I need to inform (or remind) you that Rhino Records re-remastered most of the Yes catalogue in 2003, 'The Yes Album' included.  The Rhino remasters are generally considered superior to the 1994 Atlantic remasters; additionally, the Rhinos include bonus tracks and come in digipack/slip cover cases (for albums with artwork by Roger Dean, excluding 1980's 'Drama').    Overall, this is where I would recommend new Yes fans to start with the band.  Everything you need to get a solid impression of what the band was all about is right here.  And yet, this album doesn't have training wheels; there's nothing less impressive about this album then, say, `Fragile' or `Close to the Edge' (all right, nothing really compares to `Close,' but that's a given).  Basically, this album is the most accessible of the first three classic Yes albums, and it's where the band really found its characteristic sound.  It's always a good idea to start at the beginning, so I would start with `The Yes Album,' then go from there.  And, on a broader scale, I would recommend this album to just about anyone in the world, really.  There are some things that were just destined to be classics.  `The Yes Album' is one of them.
B000083OGN|5.0|There were two albums released by Yes in the year 1972--the stellar `Close to the Edge' and this earlier effort, `Fragile.'  Yes--at this point consisting of Jon Anderson on lead vocals, Bill Bruford on drums, Steve Howe on guitars, Chris Squire on bass, and the newly-recruited Rick Wakeman on keyboards--had just scored a decent breakthrough with their third album, `The Yes Album,' in the previous year.  They had actually broken the charts in America, and they had finally reached and fortified what would be their characteristic sound in the years and albums to come. <br /> <br />So where does `Fragile' fit into all that?  The original nine tracks on `Fragile' are widely considered quintessential progressive rock, a template from which myriad later acts would spawn.  From start to finish, `Fragile' plays like well-oiled machinery (even with its occasional catches and blips), and its main material--the longer suites, mostly--demonstrates the level of maturity the band had ultimately achieved by this time in their collective career.  Oh, and `Fragile' also brings to the table a little something called \\"Roundabout,\\" which may well be the band's most famous song ever. <br /> <br />What are we waiting for?  The songs (in detail): <br /> <br />1. \\"Roundabout\\" - Well, well.  Do I really need to comment upon this one?  Unlike many popular, therefore overplayed songs, this one just doesn't get old.  Play it as many times as you like, and it still captivates.  Right from the onset, with Steve Howe's guitar harmonics, one can hear the innovation and compositional brilliance of the band.  And as the introduction moves on into the body of the piece, an irresistible lick makes itself heard again and again, though it never grows tiresome.  The middle section of the piece, with its fantastically arranged vocals, inspires pure awe, and the soft and pensive section which follows adds a much-appreciated dynamic contrast.  The Mellotron flutes are particularly nice, though of course they only play a few poly-chords.  What follows is one of Rick Wakeman's most spectacular solo escapades (though of course the one in \\"Close to the Edge\\" is his supreme solo effort), a repetition of earlier parts of the song, and the riveting conclusion, replete in layered, overdubbed vocals and presented with minimal backing to enhance the effect.  A simple flourish by Steve Howe ends the piece in understatement.  In a word, stunning. <br /> <br />2. \\"Cans And Brahms\\" - This is Rick Wakeman's showcase song on the album (each member gets a chance to show off in solo).  It's not bad, though it's not original.  It's basically an arrangement of various Brahms melodies, played on slightly unconventional instrumentation.  The work demonstrates for all to see Wakeman's peerless technical ability, but I do wish he (or the band in care of him) would have come up with something original.  Still, though, it's short enough that it goes by before it overstays its welcome. <br /> <br />3. \\"We Have Heaven\\" - This is Jon Anderson's chance to shine.  Here, in a vivid, multilayered arrangement, he sings a bunch of nonsense, albeit in impressive fashion.  Though I respect the tremendous skill required to have laid down such a track, I personally find this work insufferably annoying and repetitive.  It did not make it onto my iPod. <br /> <br />4. \\"South Side Of The Sky\\" - Ah, here we are with the second of the epic pieces.  This one is a great deal darker and more angular than \\"Roundabout,\\" and its lyrics allegedly deal with a failed Antarctic expedition where the explorers end up dying.  Though with Yes, you can never be sure.  Even so, this song is a true masterpiece of instrumentation, beginning with a brumal blast of synthesized Antarctic wind (apparently previous editions of the album also included footsteps, which have now been moved to the end of the previous track, where I have never heard them because I can't stand to listen to the third track to completion), and--in that weirdYes-esque manner--it rocks.  The middle section is a dark, piano-dominated piece of disjointed yet substantial clockwork, culminating in a neutral vocal section which might be representative of the gates of heaven opening for the doomed explorers.  After a return to the motifs from the beginning of the song, the work ends on a fadeout into the same howling wind with which it began. <br /> <br />5. \\"Five Per Cent For Nothing\\" - It might take you longer to read this description than it would for you to listen to the song.  It's really that short--around 35 seconds or so.  Bruford's showcase, it's a little drum pattern, repeated twice, with instrumentation from the rest of the band thrown in for good measure.  I guess they figured 35 seconds is about five percent of a song, so that's how they arrived at this title.  It makes a nice little introduction to the next track, so it works. <br /> <br />6. \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" - This is the infamous pop monster that, nonetheless, maintains the progressive feel so integral to Yes.  It's pleasant to listen to, and it's one of the shorter of Yes's full-band involvement songs up to this point.  The beginning line, with Steve Howe's expert guitar work running in parallel across the stereo field, is a sound to behold.  Once Chris Squire enters the fray, things get really interesting.  This song has one of the most enduring bass lines ever conceived, even among Yes songs.  Squire is among the most innovative of bassists, and his trademark, treble-heavy tone really helps the mood of this piece.  And, of course, Jon Anderson is up in the stratosphere singing away about nothing.  But then, Yes is music where, though very pretty in their own right, the lyrics are unimportant.  Anderson's lyrics paint pictures of emotion, they don't broadcast it of their own volition.  In this he was one of music's greatest poets. <br /> <br />7. \\"The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus)\\" - Here's a shocker: All the instrumentation that isn't drums is performed by Chris Squire's bass.  What an original concept!  If only the band had expounded upon what they had discovered here, they could really have come up with some interesting material.  Even so, this is by far one of the most interesting of tracks from `Fragile.'  \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" segues into this track, so \\"The Fish\\" is akin to a separate movement of the previous track.  Oh, and yes, they do sing the words \\"Schindleria Praematurus\\" at the end of the song.  Why?  I don't know.  Obviously it's the Latin name for a fish, but as to why it was chosen to name this song, I have no clue. <br /> <br />8. \\"Mood For A Day\\" - It's Howe's turn up to bat, with this showcase song.  I never though much of \\"Clap\\" (often mislabeled \\"The Clap\\" to the horror and extreme annoyance of Steve Howe), and I suppose that holds true for this song as well.  Steve Howe is a brilliant guitarist, probably one of the two best in the history of the art, and were I myself a guitarist I might find this track wholly more interesting.  As a keyboardist, I probably listen to \\"Cans And Brahms\\" a great deal more than most `Fragile' listeners.  There's nothing wrong with \\"Mood For A Day;\\" I'm just not qualified to evaluate it objectively. <br /> <br />9. \\"Heart Of The Sunrise\\" - Ah.  Bliss.  Here we have the ultimate closer to an exemplary album.  Beginning with a bang with an intriguing instrumental jam, this theme is then explored for two-and-a-half minutes before the song begins, very softly, yet never relenting until it reaches its climax.  And what a climax it is!  Anderson sings a high D (the one just above tuning A-440) which, when immersed in a chord is nothing special, naked and at the high point of a song is nothing short of breathtaking (even though he doesn't hold it and it sounds a little forced).  Jon's voice can go much, much higher, but this particular note is so well placed that it says, commandingly, that the listener has arrived at the ultimate climax of the song. <br /> <br/>It's just too bad that this isn't really the end.  There is a return of that energetic instrumental jam, then a pregnant silence.  Then, after about six seconds or so, a reprise of that ghastly third track, \\"We Have Heaven\\" bursts out of nowhere and fades out the track.  The idea was brilliant, but since I hated the song the first time, I really wasn't particularly thrilled to hear it again, especially tacked on to one of the best songs on the album.  At least that pause is long enough to where I can just skip the ending.  I considered altering the track before putting it on my iPod (basically removing that ending section), but I couldn't bring myself to desecrate a progressive rock masterpiece in that manner, even if I don't agree with the way it was arranged. <br /> <br />Overall, I would recommend `Fragile' to just about anyone, particularly those new to Yes.  In this instance, there is nothing wrong with this release that would make it \\"for newbies.\\"  On the contrary, this album offers a vivid picture of just what made Yes the masterful progressive rock band it was, in a manner that is akin to on-the-job training.  This album was made to make music, not to indoctrinate or placate fans.  That, in part, is what makes Yes so special: They made music first, and radio-friendly music only if it turned out that way. <br /> <br />Thank God for `Fragile,' or there might never have been a `Close to the Edge.'

0786868694|4.0|I love to cook and I have an absolute fetish for cookbooks. This one satisfied those loves perfectly. I've tried about five of the recipes so far and they are wonderful, probably because her recipes make no attempts at being low-fat or healthy. I love her writing about the food--it's down-to-earth, sexy, and practical. The photography is gorgeous and the layout of the book into categories like \\"Party Girl,\\" \\"Comfort Food\\", etc give the book added character instead of the regular divisions like \\"Starters,\\" \\"Desserts,\\" etc. This book isn't for the constant health food fiend, or even for the beginning cook (though the recipes really aren't difficult, some are quite involved).

B000HA4W4S|2.0|i really, really, reallllly wanted to like this album, but, even after multiple listens, the majority of the tracks here just seem like filler.  i fell asleep halfway through the record.  it's a shame that the bonus tracks steal the show here [\\"transistor\\" and \\"making ladies\\" especially].  it's almost as if they were trying too hard to sound fresh... when all they had to do was let their new york roots grow out.  the packaging seems very gimicky.  i like that they took risks with this one, but sadly, it doesn't work.  *cringe* despite my opinion of this album however, the scissor sisters ROCK and more power to 'em.
0307346609|5.0|Max puts the zombie novel shambling down a on a new path with this book.  I like the fact that Brooks goes old style with his zombies. These are the old Romero zombies- they don't get you by using machine guns (ugh), or being lightning fast, or magical powers- they get you by sheer numbers.  The one spin that Max goes for is how such a monumental disastrous \\"plague\\" that almost wipes out humanity actually brings people together.  It is one of the few books that actually has a \\"happier\\" under lining theme that when it gets down to it people almost everywhere eventually drop what divides them and unite against a common enemy.  Not saying this is a silly Hollywood action movie (it would make a fine mini-series) just that some of the zombie fiction has been sooooo bleak it is nice to see how Mr. Brooks takes all the clichés and literally lets us see some light at the end of the dark and scary tunnel.  Of course with some social commentary he doesn't forget to have good scares, exciting and well written action, fascinating characters, and good zombie gore   Highly recommended not just to zombie fans but those who like a good scare and a little more.
B00005JMUA|5.0|The second part of Tarantino's martial arts epic is quite different from the first in many aspects. It begins with more revelations about what happened to the massacre at the small chapel and goes on with the revenge taken by the \\"bride\\". This time though the bad people have some nasty surprises for the heroine who faces the most desperating situation that you can imagine. I really enjoyed the flash-back to the heroine's training as a student of a cruel but wise Chinese master of martial arts and the fight with the one-eyed opponent had a very deserving and surprising finale. Bill has also some aces up in his sleeve but not the ultimate one which the \\"bride\\" applies in the end. A powerful and more philosophical film than Part One. The end is a triumph of love, as simple feelings of the kind that ordinary people experience, overcome and transform the highly trained killer.
0451529308|5.0|This may sound ridiculous, but I was bound and determined to hate this novel. I had managed to avoid it all my life, but was recently assigned the text in a graduate class on the \\"Study of the Novel.\\" I consider myself a feminist, and a somewhat cynical one at that, and was sure this was going to be too \\"Pollyanna\\" for my literary tastes. I stand corrected!<br />I absolutely fell in love with Jo's tomboyish headstrong character and furthermore, I must confess that next to Dolores Price (from Wally Lamb's \\"She's Come Undone) and David Copperfield (Dickens' own), Laurie has become one of my all-time favorite literary characters.<br />There are a lot of overly religious maxims being spewed forth in the first half of the book, but it was not enough to detract from my overall enjoyment. And while the book is \\"light hearted\\" in many respects, there are many serious topics worthy of graduate level discussion, such as the suppression of feminine anger and utilization and importance of self control, inner versus outer appearances, Victorian expectations of behaviors across classes and genders, and the cause and effect of the absence of the \\"father\\" for the sisters, as well as Laurie.<br />My overall literary experience has been greatly enriched by having read this book and I recommend it to all who have not yet had the pleasure of reading it. Of course, I especially recommend it to those skeptics out there, like me, who think they already have the whole thing pegged for \\"fluff\\" :)<br />Alcott's \\"Little Women\\" is, without question, an American masterpiece and deserves to be on the shelves with the \\"Huck Finn\\"s and \\"Great Gatsby\\"s.
0307341542|4.0|Summary, no spoilers.<br /><br />This is the story of Camille Preaker, who works as a reporter for a newspaper in Chicago. She has been assigned to cover the story of a possible child serial killer in a small town in Missouri. She was given this story mainly because this small town happens to be her hometown.<br /><br />We know that Camille is a physically beautiful, but very troubled young woman. We know that she does not want to go home, and throughout the course of this disturbing novel we find out why.<br /><br />I found this to be a very interesting story, and a page-turner which is high compliment. This book does an excellent job of showing the repercussions of child abuse, and what life is like in a small town.<br /><br />The only reason this book did not get 5 stars is the mystery aspect. I cannot say more without a spoiler, but I found that part of the resolution improbable for a variety of reasons.<br /><br />Still, this is a suspenseful, *different* book, and I think that the character of Camille Preaker will stay with me for a long time. I would definitely give Gillian Flynn another try.
080017948X|5.0|Bill Murray's, (since his tenure on SNL) acting career has moved from good to the astounding, a great stand-up in his own right, the actor has pushed his own boundaries, and in the early days, taking on projects way beyond his talent, i.e., The Razors Edge, however, as the years move on, the man continues to entertain us with his particular style of humour.<br /><br />Most of his eighties films, Stripes, Ghostbusters, et al, are truly funny films, even after twenty years since their initial release, they continue, no matter how many times you've seen them, bring out at least a chuckle. All are hilarious, but Groundhog Day (1993) stands out because it touches on themes that matter: love, kindness, selfishness, selflessness; a sense of community and, for the most part, the value of living in the moment, that is, the life long mission of improving self and those around us.<br /><br />In the end, though, it is about reaching one's full potential, examining one self, and living an authentic life.<br /><br />Taking this even further, at the risk of sounding too sentimental, Groundhog Day is a Romantic comedy with a twist.<br /><br />The story is about a cynical Phil Connors, a weather man who has seen it all before, arrogant, self absorbed and a little nasty. After his first day in Puxatawny, he awakes to a Nietzschean nightmare, the notion of eternal occurrence, where our existence is a circle, repeating the same situations, meeting the same people, experiencing similar events forever until finally, perhaps, the merry-go-round stops and you're allowed to get off.<br /><br />But how do we stop the merry-go-round, the endless same life lessons, hitting us in the face, over and over again?<br /><br />Well, really, according to Groundhog Day, the solution is authenticity and love.<br /><br />It is only when Phil realizes who he actually is, following Plato's suggestion, \\"Know thy Self\\", and pursues his true aspirations and the one he truly loves, that the merry-go-round-stops, and life becomes truly worth living.<br /><br />Groundhog Day is my favourite Murray film because the script, story and direction was created for him and he rose to the occasion, making this film one of the greatest Romantic comedies in the last twenty years.merry-go-round-stops, and life becomes truly worth living. <br /> <br />Groundhog Day is my favourite Murray film because the script, story and direction was created for him and he rose to the occasion, making this film one of the greatest Romantic comedies in the last twenty years. <br /> <br />
B000002JSJ|3.0|I love Jimmy Page, but I don't care what he says: I feel Presence was duly rated back in the days, and has become now way overrated! I also love some of the compositions, but the production is brutal and the sound, ugly. It cannot hold a candle to albums such as III, IV, Houses or Graffiti (even if you segregate from this one only the fresh material), because all of these records, and esp. IV, have lushness in balance with the power, plus a high dose of musical imagination in the writing and of inventiveness in the production. I was not at those '77 tour shows, but I have no doubt that Presence did well as live material, if I can rely on the Knebworth DVD. However, as an actual studio LP/CD (I judge here from both the original US album and the remastered CD version), well good chunks of it simply suck... AND - and this is no small issue - Robert Plant's voice is badly shot nearly all over! Granted, Mr. Plant had just went through some very sad, personal ordeal and so was physically unfit. But this does not change anything to the fact that he should not have recorded the sub-par performances included here. In parts, I find him atrocious (\\"Royal Orleans\\", where he barely hits the notes)... To think that they had delayed releasing \\"Houses of the Holy\\" for an eternity just because they didn't like the printer's color rendering for the LP cover job... Why did Page chose to write this heavy, gritty RnR material for Robert to sing at that time, and thus to carry so painfully the Zeppelin torch and legacy is beyond me...    I realize the stripped-to-the-bone production was probably purposeful (punk movement `round the bend). But did Page really designed his guitar parts to be THAT buried down in the mix (and conversely the bass guitar to be so loud)? On \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\", you can barely hear him, as drowned out in the bass sound as he is!    As a fan of Led Zeppelin, you do need to get this one. But be warned and don't pay premium!
B000024D4R|5.0|It's so hard to call any album perfect, but few come as close as this one. Maybe the Beatles, or Dylan can compare to the mastery of artistry, mood, flow and pacing that makes this album feel so right. If an album could melt in your mouth, this one would.

B00003BDXG|5.0|Natural Born Killers took a stab at the media, penal system, and American culture so deep that it still has not recovered. Oliver Stone has always made risqué films, and has always in my personal opinion put his heart and soul into them. Films such \\"The Doors\\", \\"Platoon\\" and \\"Nixon\\" which all captured some degree of humanity and subculture do not even hold a candle to this phenomenal work. The infusion of animation, pop culture and askew directing make this story (written by Quentin Tarantino) one of epic proportions.  <br /> I may be going a bit over board when I say this, but to me this is the best love story since Romeo and Juliet, except this one is much more bloody and sadistic. You have two unusual human beings, one was brought up by an alcoholic sex addict father that rapes and pillages every chance he gets along with a mother that lets it all happen, and the other is brought up by a physically abusive father and a mentally abusive mother. The two have a lot in common; mostly rage and anger but also a longing for someone to love them. Because of these factors the two go on a homicidal spree across the country.  <br /> Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory Knox (Juliette Lewis) tear through Route 666 in a frenzy of murder and lust until they are picked up at a convenient store by Detective Scagnettie (Tom Sizemore) and some of his police pals. The two maniacs were almost forced into the store after being bit by rattlesnakes in the desert. Then they go to prison and the real fun begins. Don't worry I won't spoil it for you. <br />  The sex and violence formula plays out for these two twisted heroes, until of course their eventual capture and demise. While the viewer is unsure whether or not to root for these apocalyptic crusaders, they do triumph in the end.  <br /> The extras that accompany this flick are wonderful, especially the deleted scenes and the alternate ending. When Ashley Judd is in the courtroom being cross examined by Woody Harrelson, welllets just say that should have been put in the movie instead of just being an outtake.  <br />
0385337388|2.0|I was turned onto this book by a friend of mine who is a doctor who told me that I would love it because it's very similiar to Catch-22.  So instead of giving you the whole rundown on the plot, I'll focus on why his statement was true and false.<br /><br />When I discovered Catch-22, it absolutely rocked my world.  I had never found myself in a story that was so crazy, contradictory, confusing, yet exhillerating.  Since then, I've tried numerous authors who employed the same \\"absurdist\\" approach to their novels.  Vonnegut, Robbins, Brautigan, Pynchon etc., and yet none of them have ever really satisfied me in the same way.  Add Samuel Shem to that list.  To say this book is \\"similiar to Catch-22\\" is a vast understatement.  While reading it, I felt like the author read Catch-22 and said \\"hey, i can do that, I'll just move it to a hospital setting.\\"  The first problem is that although the setting is certainly \\"crazy\\" and nerve-wracking, stress-full (like a war setting), it doesn't have the same \\"fun\\" feel as Heller's crazy warzone.  A war is a terrible place to be, but while reading Catch-22, it was like a funhouse that you don't want to leave.  I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.  In HOG, like many of the terns, I just wanted to get out of the hospital and go to sleep.  The strange actions of both the doctors and the patients seemed contrived.  It's hard to explain why but it simply missed the mark.<br /><br />The second problem is that the main characters, while interesting, aren't quite \\"compelling.\\"  I don't feel like I know Dr. Basch, and I certainly wasn't rooting for him the way I like to when I'm reading a novel.  I tried to get through this book but only made it about half-way (which is rare for me to give up on one).  That's not to say that this book is terrible.  There are some good characters and some funny, interesting scenes, but all in all, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't in Med School.
0767817664|5.0|\\"Fright Night\\" stands the test of time as an entertaining and often surprisingly disturbing scare-fest from the mid 80s. A teenaged boy discovers to his horror that a vampire master has moved in next door, with his creepy half-human sidekick. Can the teen convince his friends the threat is real, and recruit famed movie \\"vampire killer\\" Peter Vincent to help dispatch the demonic creature? You'll have fun finding out. Highly recommended for Halloween party viewing - I watch it each year with a group of friends, and we have a blast every time. Well worth the modest purchase price. Five stars!
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Too long have I waited for a Christmas album from this glorious artist. Her voice and the production of her music is well suited for this kind of sound.<br /><br />One thing great about Sarah's music is that I often find myself so anxious for the entire thing that sitting through one track is nearly unbareable. And not because the track is unbareable at all, but because I'm just so yearning for more no matter what. Her music is simply beautiful in every sense of the word. And I feel that Mrs. McLachlan captures the spirit of the season better than anyone since the days of the Rat Pack.<br /><br />Some may argue that this album is too sad for the Christmas season, but if you dig deeper, the music is not about the sadness but the comfort. These songs are very comforting during a season that to some is depressing. I recently lost my grandmother. She was an amazing woman who loved her family and Christmas as well. In fact, we had a Christmas tradition where she would come to our house on Christmas Eve and my sister and I would open our gifts. And this will be my first Christmas without that and I am fearful of it. But this album is making it easier for me, to get rid of the anxiety now and to find the comfort in the season.<br /><br />My favorite songs are \\"River,\\" \\"Song For A Winter's Night,\\" \\"In the Bleak Mid-Winter,\\" and \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas.\\" Each song is wonderful, though. And each person will undoubtedly find their own favorite that will easily relate to their comfort. I would have loved a cover of \\"Somewhere In My Memory,\\" but we can't always get what we want.<br /><br />Concluding, if you're a fan of Sarah McLachlan, Christmas music or just beautiful music period, make sure this album is in your collection. The only negative is that at the end you'll be begging for more.
034544678X|4.0|Patricia McConnell is probably best known the co-host of Wisconsin Public Radio's \\"Calling All Pets.\\" But she has also written a series of books. \\"The Other End of the Leash\\" is probably the best known. As an ethologist specializing in canines, she brings a different, professional viewpoint to people's relations with their pets.<br /><br />Her point is simple: dogs and humans both communicate, but because we are very different animals, we often misread each other's nonverbal cues. The nonverbal greeting signals for a human, for example, are threat signals to a dog. What she does is help dog owners learn to send the nonverbal messages they intend to their dogs, to speak to dogs in the nonverbal dialog that dogs understand.<br /><br />It's an important, even critical point, in dealing with dogs. Mixed signals, unintended signals and the wrong signals can confuse a dog, and even trigger hostility and attack. It's especially important for stranger dogs. Her points can help you a lot in dealing with dogs.<br /><br />But what this book isn't is a primer on training your dog. It's a guide to dog behavior, it's not a book on how to train your dog. Make no mistake, Dr. McConnell's insights can be of immense help to you in training and dealing with dogs. A dog that is relaxed and comfortable, that isn't getting the wrong nonverbal signals, is easier to train. But it's not a training book.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, sometimes Dr. McConnell repeats her points a few extra times. Perhaps it is a consequence of dealing with difficult dogs and difficult dog owners for a long time. But that's a minor annoyance. This is a valuable useful book to anyone with a difficult dog or any dog owner who wants to understand his or her dog better.<br /><br />Recommended.
1580084621|5.0|I lived in Thailand for seven years but didn't try to cook Thai cuisine until I moved back to the U.S.  I love all ten of my Thai cookbooks for different reasons, but this is the one which transformed my technique.

B000H0MKOC|2.0|So many critics heaped so much praise on this movie, I came to it with high expectations. But I was very disappointed.  <br /> <br />Its idea of making a lobbyist for a tobacco consortium the \\"hero\\" of the film held promise. This could have been an opportunity to satirize a lot of the political correctness that has been surrounding the whole subject of smoking and health and big business. But I don't think that promise was even remotely fulfilled in this film. <br /> <br />What I saw was essentially (and no doubt inadvertently) just another dreary public service ad like the ones that lamely try to convince people not to smoke. The ads on TV pander to teens with slogans like \\"Smoking stinks\\" or \\"Smoking isn't cool.\\"  In this movie the clichéd message is conveyed by having anyone who ever smoked die. The Marlboro Man, played here by Sam Elliott painted in embittered wasting purple hues - dies. When our lobbyist hero needs to talk to Mr. Big of the tobacco consortium, played by Robert Duvall, our hero can't because, of course, the Duvall character has - died.  I expected a lot more of this movie than such obvious lecturing.  <br /> <br />In addition to its overall failure though, I found this movie to be made up of many little failures. It's a series of non-sequiturs, loosely cobbled together.  The disconnect starts early with the lobbyist's opening monologue when he says, \\"Manson kills; I talk.\\"  <br /> <br />Later, he gets kidnapped by some unidentified group, and is plastered over with nicotine patches. He survives this assault, but his system is left so compromised, he can never again take even one puff of a cigarette without risking death. I'm not aware of any medical consequence like that. Nevertheless, when he later defies Doctors' advice and takes a puff, he does pass out with near-fatal anoxia. This and a dozen other scenes are not funny exaggeration - they are simply ridiculous, random insertions. <br /> <br />The writer's/director's lack of any coherent vision for this film becomes plainer yet if you watch the DVD extras, such as the deleted scenes. One of these shows the lobbyist coming down the steps of the Capitol after having delivered a rousing speech on freedom of choice before a Congressional Hearing Committee. As he pauses on the Capitol Building steps, his son (about 12-years-old?) takes a cigarette out of his pocket and starts to light up. His father, glancing over in alarm, slaps the cigarette out of the boy's hand. What was supposed to be the point of this scene - that the father is a hypocrite and is willing to override any \\"freedom of choice\\" argument when it comes to HIS son who is smoking? But why would such a young boy even be carrying cigarettes to such a formal occasion in the first place and why would he choose that most public moment to flaunt his smoking habit? It doesn't make sense! But the writer/director didn't axe this scene on the basis of logic. They say in their commentary that they loved the scene, but were forced to cut it simply for reasons of pacing.  <br /> <br />The DVD commentary overall reveals how flimsy and illogical this whole project was. That commentary degenerates into what is essentially just a round of good old boy jocularity and mutual admiration. The men involved in this project congratulate each other on every point. They praise the tricky brilliance of making the blinds in one scene into the shape of enlarged cigarettes. This touch is absolutely undetectable to the viewers, and would be meaningless even if evident.  <br /> <br />Then the actors and director repeatedly laud Christopher Buckley, who wrote the book on which this script is based. I can't help but think his father William's reputation for verbal cleverness got transferred to Christopher, unjustifiably at least in the case of this film. Because really, this movie is just blowing smoke.  <br />

B000H0MKOC|2.0|Why do I punish myself like this. First of all I read the book by Christopher Buckley because I really like his writing. Occasionally while reading it there was a slight movement of my lips that could be interpreted as the very beginning of a smile. Chris, old buddy, you really let me down with this one I thought when I finished it.<br /><br />One day in an inexplicably strange mood I decided to buy the DVD. Let me say at the onset that I totally love black humor. Perhaps I thought that maybe the screenplay would include some great black humor. I don't know. I do know that while watching the movie my lips began to move again. A laugh? No, a yawn.<br /><br />First of all the anti hero of the story is a shallow, empty person who has only one talent: the ability to spin, and he is quite good at that. I kept saying to him as I watched him: \\"Go away, get out of my living room.\\" Mind you I can tolerate evil characters; Shakespeare created a lot of them, and some of them are deliciously evil. But this guy? He's a cipher that is so concscienceless that he takes his young son with him on his travels so that he can learn the trade of being a facile liar. Son becomes quite proud of dad. Our hero is so hated by the public (including, perhaps, most of the movie audience) that he is kidnapped and plastered from head to toe with nicotine patches. I kept thinking \\"die, die.\\"<br /><br />Most of the humor in the movie concerns listening to spin. Don't we get enough spin in our everyday life? Why is this funny? No one in the whole movie has a soul, neither the tobacco executives, the hollywood agent, the pretty lady newspaper reporter (who beds our spinmeister so that he will reveal all), the liquor industry spokeslady, the NRA spinner, or the young son. This undoubtedly is part of the message to us, but I can't quite understand the concept of let's show a bunch of shallow people, and do it in a very shallow way. Yes that surely will make us all laugh.<br /><br />The humor too subtle for me? Well I do like black humor that does come crashing down on me, but I do think this flick is farce without the funny. Kind of a downer to get hit over the head with both the book and the movie. Maybe I'll go cheer up by watching \\"Freeway\\" with Reese Witherspoon again. That oughta do it.humor too subtle for me?

Rex & Marc Bolan influence in a few songs, which is always welcome. This is easily one the best albums of the 90's. The melodies are so strong, it's really beyond words. This is classic \\"Brit Pop\\" at it's peak. Buy this cd, and play it loud.
B00000AFWW|3.0|I bought this album and then forgot about it for quite a long time.  Then after loading everything I owned to my iPod I rediscovered Hole.  I think that there are quite a few really good tracks on this album and some that really shouldn't have made it.  On the good list are: Celebrity Skin, Dying, Playing Your Song and Petals.  On the bad list are Awful and Hit So Hard.  The rest of the tracks are listenable but not spectacular. <br /> <br />It is worth owning, but it is not fantastic
B0009P42VE|5.0|after all these reviews they still haven't corrected the problem. I thought i made the mistake of ordering the wrong format, but after checking and double checking the listing, i realize it's not me - it's them.  I sent the stupid PSP version back and hope they get me the right version.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|Expectations are a funny thing. It was expectation that made me buy this album as soon as it was in stores, and it was the same expectation that led me to feel -- at first -- a little disappointed.    Disappointment in music is nothing new, especially if you pay too much attention to critics. If an album's too much like the one before it, they're in a rut. Too different and they've lost their way. Daft Punk managed to turn a lot of critics on their heads with \\"Discovery\\", most that gave it middle of the road reviews have since changed their tune, thankfully addmitting that Homework Part 2 would have been too simple. But still many were and still are uncomfortable, mislabelling the fleshing out of their sound as going mainstream. I'm sure I would have tired of One More Time if I actually listened to the radio, but if you tune into Top 40 you get what you deserve.    When \\"Human After All\\" landed, you could cut the anticipation with a knife. A lot of the negative reviews I've seen branch off from a literal interpretation of the title before it even saw light. People everywhere were looking forward to a more vibrant, living, breathing Daft Punk. We might be treated to that in another few years, we might not. It's not important. Daft Punk did the classy thing and decided not to make another Discovery. They made new fans with that album, and that's great, I can't think of another act that deserved a bigger fan base more than them. When I first heard their latest, I couldn't find the heart. I fell into the trap of assuming they took the easy way out, and cooked some passable beats to get an album out.    But time makes fools of us all, and it didn't take too long for me to fall in love with \\"Human After All\\". Like Rollin' & Scratchin' and Short Circuit before them, the songs here have no immediate bells and whistles, and I won't lie; if you don't have patience for good music the slow burn of these songs will mean nothing. That said, this is definately the third album thatDaft Punk needed to make. We've all heard the stories by now about how little time was spent crafting them, but that's expectations getting in the way again.    Daft Punk have gone from amazing underground act, to shining stars of French house, and back again; deeper, darker, more subtle. This album grew on me, but I can't promise everyone will feel it. What I do know is that if you want to hear some very nice ideas, with a distinct Daft Punk vibe, then this is an essential album.    Key tracks:    + Robot Rock  + The Prime Time Of Your Life  + The Brainwasher
B0000A98ZP|4.0|I dont know what its like to have gone to school in the 1980's or have gone to school in the United States but I can still relate to this movie. This movie could have been set anywhere and in any decade and it would still tell the same story, only fashion and accessories would be different. Everyone has seen this movie by now and everyone has an opinion on it and most will say it is a really good movie. I would say that it deserves to be called a classic by now. It may not be a laugh out loud comedy or very dramatic and does move a little slow at times, but it delivers its message loud and clear and keeps you engaged throughout the whole movie. It gains momentum as it moves along and by the end, after experiencing all the emotiions you will feel satisfied.<br /><br />Being a small cast, all your attention is focused on the individual characters. The 5 students are all completely different from one another and all are brilliant. Each actor plays their part perfectly. While there is a large age gap between them they are all convincing as teenagers fighting there own demons. They will all probably be most remembered for this movie, with the exception of Emilio Estevez, but special mention must go to Judd Nelson who I believe is the biggest star of the film. His part was originally intended for either Nicholas Cage or John Cusack who would have also been great, but I'm glad Judd got his chance to prove his acting capabilities.<br /><br />It is a shame the DVD lacks many special features. All you get is a trailer and cast bios, I was desperately seeking an audio commentary, or at the very least production notes, however there are some interesting facts noted on IMDB.<br /><br />A teen movie for the 80's generation, anyone born after the film was made will probably not like it, but for others who grew up around or just after it will probably agree this movie is indeed a classic.<br /><br />7.5/10
B000FC2FVA|5.0|Having followed Phoenix's discography along with Air, Tahiti 80, Zoot Woman, and a long list of other French bands that I found from links that traced back to Daft Punk, I suddenly find them in a class higher above -- and all their own -- compared to many of their ilk.    This is an amazing album, from start to finish. Previous releases \\"United\\" and \\"Alphabetical\\" were fantasic albums, too, but their ambition outweighed their purpose. That sounds like it might be a good thing, and in many ways it was, but the frailty of \\"their sound\\" meant that the textures were always shifting, different from song to song, in a way that kept them from feeling whole.    With \\"It's Never Been Like That\\" Phoenix have found their legs to stand on, and developed a sound that manages to evoke all that they've ever been, but at the same time remain completely themselves. This isn't mood music, or something to leave in the background. This is joyous, celebratory, \\"sing along with your window rolled down\\" driving music.    This album is rock and pop, get up and dance, sit down and nod. It's everything music should be, played with breathless enthusiasm, yet somehow seeming effortless. Though I risk over-selling it to the point of disappointment, I'm willing to take that risk. These songs will plant their hooks into your brain, and you won't want them to leave.    Key tracks:    + Consolation Prizes  + Courtesy Laughs  + Sometimes In The Fall
B000H7JD4K|5.0|This is the best Iron Maiden album since Bruce returned. It is simply miles above &#34;No Prayer for the Dying&#34;, &#34;Fear of the Dark&#34;, not to mention the Blaze-era albums. Heck, sometimes I find it even better and less &#34;dated&#34; thatn &#34;Seventh Son of Seventh Son&#34;, &#34;Somewhere in Time&#34;..<br /><br />Although the songs follow the usual trend of being long and repeating choruses, they are very good, well crafted, with very good lyris. THE LONGEST DAY is my favorite one.<br /><br />The production is raw, but crisp enough, strong and with a lasting impact. Just lsiten to this whole album in your headphones, and you will know what I mean.<br /><br />How could I know that a Maiden album released in 2006 would become my favorite Iron Maiden album...
B000H7JD4K|5.0|I was hoping for a good return by the veterns. I was pleased and beyond. Dance of Death was an average album. It had a few moments but nothing compared to this cd. The rich melodies and twin guitar use is awesome.Yes the production isn't as clean as it could be. But that didn't hamper it to much for me. I know people are going to compare this to anything they have done in the past and say that (killers, number of the beast 7 son ..etc) is better. Well the 80's was the metal age, but old bands can still write good material. True some of it might get recycled but isn't that what all music becomes? Riff's are recycled or manipulated a little. <br />Beware..the beast has returned!
B00005BL2A|5.0|Depeche changes with each album and their changes are always good. They explore new areas of sound. This album is certainly different from Violater or SOFAD or even Ultra.  <br />The \\"Dead of Night\\" sounds a little alien and certainly the beat is irregulary and heavy. I love how after a few listens I start to crave the sound. Lovetheme is an unusual short song without any vocals.  There is the normal split on DM albums of fast and slow songs. Breathe, Goodnight Lovers (who doesn't sing along to this song!), and When the Body Speaks are all slower songs that fill the listener with relaxed feelings and a mixed happy and sad emotional state. There are more upbeat songs lik Dream on and I Feel Loved that make the listener want to move in the way that DM so amazingly does.  <br />Songs from this album weren't played on the radio as much as songs from other albums because this album doesn't have the immediate grabbing popularity of songs that make the radio. I, personally, am sick of popular radio and its search for faddish and similar songs. However, listening to the Exciter CD a few times straight convinces me that there is as much depth in the album as in any other of their albums. Any DM fan should own a copy of the CD and will enjoy it. If you are new to DM start with one of their more mainstream ablums and discover the unique style that is DM.
B00003CXA6|4.0|There is no questioning this film is done very well. That said, it should be pointed out that it may not be for everyone. If you are not a fan of cliches, stay away from this. There are TONS of monologues that go on for long periods of time with epic music in the background, and maybe not everyone can handle that. Most of the performances are incredible, my favorite happens to be Jeff Daniels. One performance that doesn't do it for me is Martin Sheen. He shares a lot of scenes with Tom Berenger and it seems like Berenger is the one keeping those scenes afloat. C. Thomas Howell has a steady part but you won't recognize him as the kid from the Outsiders. Great battle scenes, especially the big one in the open field at the end.
0156027321|4.0|Although I had a bit of trouble getting into the first 3rd of this remarkable novel, my persistence was rewarded with an incredible book, which leaves so much open to interpretation and discussion.  The story of a boy who is shipwrecked, and forced to live on a lifeboat with a tiger for months, it is also the story of our world, our lives and our families.  One can't help but wonder about the nature of truth and meaning of our coexistence.  In short, it's an impressively rich and meaningful literary journey.  Well worth your time.
B00005JP87|5.0|I haven't seen many good movies lately but this one was the exception. An awesome movie that has the atmosphere, the actors and plot to keep you involved. Highly recommended!
B000BHN7DE|5.0|I first viewed Anastacia about 15 years ago on MTV a talent show if you will. She placed in second which was a joke. Anatacia has the \\"WHOLE\\" package!!! I live in Florida and she is Hot here. It is to bad that the rest of the USA does not play or carry her music. She by far is a True Diva! This CD is \\"outstanding\\" as well as her others were. This is the best of Anastacia and has new releases that have not been released in the USA. It is a double CD and is simply more than I could have asked for. The first CD is the best of her singles and some new songs, the second is if you will a dance mix of her singles which again I will say is \\"outstanding\\" My Compaion and I had the Pleasure of seeing her live and I have yet to see another female artist give what she has in the pop world. When comes to great muics for dance and Love this is it! I only again wish that the USA would treat this Diva as she should be instead of her having to cross seas to become a HOT Female Artist. Anastacia has the Voice, look, body, personality and the presentation to out any female pop artist out today in the USA! I look forward to her next release knowing it will be better than that last as each one is. Oh this comes so wonderfuly packaged with a huge book like carrier. With words to each of her songs and some wonderful pictures of her. If you even think you like Her this is a Must have! <br /> <br />Joey C. <br />& <br />Jimmy W.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|I love this movie.  How can you not with such hilarious diologue?  One of my most favorites is when Yzma outlines her first plan to get rid of Kuzko.  Ending with a hilarious \\"I'll smash it with a hammer!\\"  But diologue aside, there's so much more to this movie.  The characters are so wonderfully individual, from self-absorbed Kuzko, to evil Yzma with her \\"secret lab\\", to dim witted Kronk with his shoulder angel and devil<br /><br />(Secondly, look what I can do.<br /><br />Um, I don't see how that...<br /><br />No, no.  He's got a point.)<br /><br />Over and over agian, this movie will keep you laughing.  Watch, and enjoy.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|I had read enough and seen enough about this movie to know what to expect.  I admit it could be confusing at times knowing what year I was in, but the movie did a good job of giving you hints to figure it out without having to spell it out across the bottom of the screen (think Sixth Sense). The most obvious was the length of Sandra Bullock's hair.  It was longer when she was in the past, and shorter during her current situation.<br /><br />I say keep an open mind and just enjoy this for what it is worth.  There are too few \\"feel good\\" movies these days, so I appreciated seeing a movie that wasn't bloody or full of embarassing humor and curse words.  I was even enlightened when Sandra asks, \\"What if you lived your whole life and there was no one waiting?\\"<br /><br />So what (or who) are you waiting for?  Ignore the critics and see this movie for what it's worth...for what it may be worth to you.
0767847431|1.0|One of THE MOST boring pieces of garbage I have EVER seen. My wife couldn't stand it either. Even the kids were yawning and went off to do something else. All connected with this absolute schtoonker should be ashamed. The \\"plot\\" moves more slowly than a crippled snail, and the characters are completely unengaging. Even at close to half way through the film, I couldn't have cared less about any of them. I should also add that the movie starts in the middle...of something...I know not what, though, nor do I care. The props are idiotic---the \\"amulet\\" that looks like a piece of tin foil, the idiotic mask one character wears constantly, the ship figurehead that \\"comes alive...\\" Ho-hum and hee-hee, except that the film is not even funny! It's just plain BAD.    DO NOT WASTE YOUR VALUABLE TIME. I ended up fast-forwarding to see if there was ANYTHING worth watching in this dead dog, and BELIEVE ME, there is NOT!    (I see that only one other person gave this movie just 1 star. I would have given it 0 stars, if that were possible. It appears that nearly all the reviews are from Harryhausen fans. I guess if one is a Harryhausen \\"connoisseur,\\" one might view the film differently. I can certainly say that I liked the Sinbad film where Sinbad and his men meet the cyclops. That movie moved along at a decent pace, at least, and had some real action to it. But this one? While the \\"Kali fight\\" so many reviewers mention may be engaging, the viewer should not have to agonize through a great many minutes of completely insipid plot and idiotic dialogue to finally get to see it. I am actually writing this review while my wife snores on the couch from watching this film. I suggest the \\"good\\" parts be cut out of this very flawed flick, to be made part of a Harryhausen retrospective, and the rest of the movie be chucked in the trash.)
B00023GGFI|5.0|That day in 1969, I bought this album, put it on my hi-fi, and found out what blues guitar was all about. This is one of a handful of albums that I always have kept close at hand and updated. I saw Winter live in 1970 in Columbia, SC. He had then picked up Rick Derringer and was touring about the South with The Allman Brothers. I will never forget the sight of Winter thrashing about the stage his fingers a blur of white lightening: His pale skin and white hair were so exaggerated because he was otherwise totally dressed in black. What a show that was. Until this album was released, I thought I had heard what rock/blues guitar sounded like via the albums of Cream, Hendrix and the like...but for my money, if it's pure, nasty, sliding blues guitar you want, you won't do much better than this album. It's a classic sounding as good today as it did 37 years ago; it's truly one of a kind. This is definitely an album for anyone who loves the blues and wants their collection to be complete. This is a no brainer...
B000GIXEIG|3.0|As a fan of Beowulf I really wanted to love this film. Turns out it was okay, and thats about it. Slow in spots, and it did not really follow the book all that much. I think \\"13th Warrior\\" did a better job than this newer film as being closer to the original story.
B00006IU73|5.0|I have to say I wasn't prepared to love this cd as much as I do but I'm thrilled to have found a great band sailing through the stagnant ocean of modern mediocrity that I can look forward to following for years to come.  Everything about this album is admirable.  The songs are well-crafted, the vocals are superb, the guitar and drum sounds are phenomenal and this band has discovered the secret to all famous groups that came before them.  Dynamics.  Every song packs an emotional punch and a musical surprise around every corner.  The only dip in the road through this cd is the jarring instrumental halfway through but it doesn't last long enough to completely ruin the entrancing mood.  Too bad FM radio isn't the innovating influence on the general populace that it once was or Porcupine Tree would be world-reknown superstars by now.  This incredible collection of tunes proves it beyond a doubt.
B000HCO8IQ|5.0|So rarely do I buy a CD that I find myself listening to over and over again without getting sick of it. This is the first CD in many years I've been able to play repeatedly, loving it more each time I hear it.  <br /> <br />This is music that makes you feel energized.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This seems to be Miyazake's most personal work, clearly a serious design. It is set in an imaginary time which blends the time of the ancient gods (Shinto style, gods of place and nature) with the settlement of humans and the coming of metalworking and war. The world is not in balance, and a distant conflict between industry and nature has wounded one of the gods of the forest, which is then killed by a sentry boy as it rampages into farmland he guards. The evil controlling it transfers to him, beginning a slow takeover, and he must journey to the origin of the conflict to find a way to cure himself and incidentally, as he will learn, to try to restore balance. But this is not a simplistic tale, he finds there are other characters in play, and there is good and evil in everyone, and no easy balance. The Princess (Hime) of the story is a mysterious human who has been raised by wolves (which are themselves powerful forest gods, a little reminiscent of the Amerindian Coyote myth), who becomes both his ally and his enemy. The story is not easy to understand. It has many Japanese mythic elements but even then, it is a work of Miyazake's unique imagination, and is not intended to be simple or to have a clean resolution.<br /><br />The animation is spectacular, and unusual, with new elements even for Miyazake and marks a new departure for style which you can see continued in his next film, Sen to Chihiro - more nature, more wild, more jamming on elements from Japanese myth and folklore. And, continuing the trend to be more personal, concerned with ethics and character, and less sci-fi. There are at least half a dozen well developed characters threaded through the story, and their animation is wonderful in displaying subtle character.<br /><br />The original Japanese soundtrack has some amazing singing and draws upon some of the best talent available for voices - in Japan, Miyazake is universally known and this was a masterpiece carefully crafted. Japanese television documented a lot of the production. The English translation drew on some good talent but they seem not to have \\"gotten it\\" quite so intensely as the Japanese crew.<br /><br />If you haven't seen Miyazake, give it a try (but maybe look at Sen to Chihiro first, or even Laputa or Kiki's Delivery Service, for easier and lighter introduction to his work). Some say he is the Japanese Disney, but I don't like that. His work has a depth and sophistication that goes beyond Disney cute. There is no other animation like it. This is truly an adult work: children might like some of the visuals, but I doubt that many kids below teen age will have any idea what it is all about, and even adults will get more out of this each time you see it again.cumented a lot of the production.

0375831002|5.0|Wow. Where do I begin? <br /> <br />This was simply the best book I've read all year. It may very well be the best book I have ever read. I will even venture to say it was better than To Kill A Mockingbird (one of my absolute favorite books). It was better than The Kite Runner. It was better than The Sparrow... and Atonement. Well, you get the idea. <br /> <br />I don't know if I've ever felt such emotion from the printed word. It moved me beyond description. Every single page (and quite possibly every sentence) was a gem. I've been sitting here, thumbing through the book, re-reading highlighted passages and entire chapters. There are so many quotes I could share in this review, but I think they're best read in the context of the story. <br /> <br />\\"Death\\" narrates the book and tells us of how he came to know the book thief. While a bit unconventional for a narrator, he is eloquent and, ironically, an ultimately benevolent and compassionate soul. I came to care as much for him as I did Liesel, Rosa, Hans, Max, and Rudy, each of whom is so distinctly drawn that I was left with a sense of deep love and tenderness for their individual roles in this story. <br /> <br />The Book Thief is the tale of a young girl, living with her new foster parents in Germany at the beginning of World War II. It's a story about a Jewish man in hiding. And it's story about German citizens refusing to follow along like sheep, standing their ground and showing love and compassion toward their fellow human beings. <br /> <br />This is a love story. Love of a family. Love of a stranger. Love of a playmate. Love of reading and books. <br /> <br />It's a story about courage. <br /> <br />And it's a story about death. <br /> <br />The Book Thief is an extremely emotional and draining narrative (how can anything about the Holocaust not be depressing?). I sobbed as the last pages drew closer. It's as moving as Schindler's List and The Pianist. But... I think it's worth the tears. It was just so damned good. I can't remember the last time I was so affected by a book. <br /> <br />The Book Thief is classified as a Young Adult novel, but I believe it crosses over to contemporary fiction quite well. The young protagonist (Liesel) is reminiscent of Scout (To Kill a Mockingbird) and Griff (An Unfinished Life) and I doubt I'll ever forget her or her story. The dialogue is marvelous and the pacing is consistently steady, with just enough tension to keep the pages turning (and not as predictable as I thought!). I wonder if this will ever be taught in high school English classes. It should be; it's so powerful and, I would think, suitable for that age group. (It maybe even be good for junior high school students, although perhaps they're too young to really get much out of it.) <br /> <br />This is definitely one to read again, slowly savoring the lyrical prose now that the final outcome has been revealed. Unless something else knocks my socks off (The Thirteenth Tale, perhaps?), I've found my #1 read for 2006. Absolutely phenomenal and achingly beautiful.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Just wanted to add my voice to the chorus of people who only heard of Firefly after the original TV series was cancelled.  I actually didn't even hear of the show until after Serenity (follow-on movie) was out on DVD.    The 14 episodes you'll find in this \\"Complete Series\\" DVD are TV at its finest.  The basic premise is simple:  It's 500 years into the future, but essentially, society hasn't changed all that much.  Captain Reynolds and his crew call the ship Serenity their home.  They go from planet to planet looking for jobs, legal and illegal, trying to stay out of the reach of \\"The Alliance\\", which has a penchant for telling people what to think and how to live.    The show isn't really science fiction and pretty much defies categorization.  What it does have is a great cast, exceptional writing, and very good character development.    However, due to mismanagement at 20th Century Fox, the show never had a chance to succeed.  The original pilot was aired LAST after the decision to cancel the show had been made.  Episodes were shuffled, it skipped weeks between airing...  This meant people were watching each episode lacking the proper context.  The show essentially got torpedoed so badly that creater Joss Whedon has announced he would never work with 20th Century Fox every again.  Why no other network has picked up the show, I don't know, but there are whole websites dedicated to this show where I'm sure you can find the answer.    I was fortunate enough to be able to watch the show from start to finish, as Joss intended it.  I stayed up til 4am several times, always wanting more.  But with each passing episode, there was a sense of sadness to know that I was that much closer to the end.    If ever anyone needed evidence that the executives at Fox are horrible, this is it (Research how X3 was made for additional evidence).  Why studio executives continue to green-light mindless reality TV shows instead of quality content such as Firefly will remain a mystery.I don't even watch TV anymore.  I haven't watched a TV show on a consistent basis since X-Files, or maybe ER when it was still decent.  But if Firefly were to make it back on TV, I would clear whatever evening it was on to watch it.    I just hope that we haven't seen the end of Firefly, and that it will return in the form of additional TV episodes or more movies.
B000GY729M|2.0|Don't flatter these boys. There are about 3 catchy songs....the rest may have as well been recorded in a bathroom. <br />Let's just say their record producer worked wonders on \\"Hot Fuss\\" <br /> <br />...and oh god...watching the lead singer try to sing on Saturday Night Live was extremely painful. <br /> <br />...what a dissapointment...
B000E5KJHA|5.0|This movie looks simply amazing! The color, texture and detail provided by HD-DVD are superb, this is a showcase title for the format. First a word about my setup, which is nice but far from optimal. The HD-DVD player is connected via HDMI to a Sanyo PL-Z4 projector, with an approximately 140\\" picture thrown onto a light beige wall. The room has little in the way of light control so we watch movies in the evening when there is less ambient light leaking through opaque cloth shades. Hardly the ideal environment to view a movie for most home theater afficionado's but my family and I thoroughly enjoy watching titles no less for it. <br /> <br />Now about the title - there are no compression artifacts or mosquito noise to be found anywhere. None. I also bought this title on SD-DVD and have watched on an upscaling DVD player, both on a 57\\" crt bigscreen and the projector, and there are a distracting number of the aforementioned artifacts and mosquito noise in both cases. They're most noticeable on large surface solid colors, of which there are many in this movie. You'll see them \\"dance\\" and shimmer on SD-DVD, not so on HD-DVD.  <br /> <br />The colors are bold and bright when appropriate, but what really struck me while watching the title were the drabbish gray scenes such as the snow-covered streets of the town with the factory looming in the background. You can make out more detail, without any obvious edge enhancement problems found in the original SD-DVD version. The lights from the townsfolk dwellings were suffused with a soft glow in this latest version, not a ringed mess. <br /> <br />The story itself is not necessarily an improvement over the original, rather its told from a slightly different perspective, giving more insight into Willie Wonka's character, and updating the other kids (Violet, Mike Teavee, etc...) to reflect a newer generation of youngsters. Mike feels a bit weak, he's portrayed as a videogame crazed violent kid in the sequence that introduces hischaracter, then sort of disappears into the background the rest of the movie. Veruca and Violet by contrast are more prominently featured, and you'll develop more antipathy towards their characters by their actions throughout the movie. Augustus also suffers a bit but since he's the first to get ousted from the party, it's logical that he won't be as fully developed as a character. His romp through the initial scene whilst in the factory is pretty good however. <br /> <br />Overall I'd give this 5 stars not only as a visual and audible feast for HD-DVD owners, but felt the movie was a great update to the original and stands on its own merits, even in SD-DVD presentation.
B00005B36H|5.0|Everything about TOOL is great.  They are just geniuses.  Everything from the guitar, the baseline, drums, vocals, is good, everything!  definetively worth checking them out! <br />It took me a while to get used to their long intros and outros, and their style, but after many listens it just gets better and better. <br />Best songs in the album for me are Lateralus, Parabola and The Grudge.
B00005JP87|5.0|This is one of Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti's best films ever! It catches you from the very beginning and leads you through a web of illusions all in the name of love. The movie starts near the end but then goes back to the beginning to tell the story which is a little confusing but all makes sense in the end. It also keeps you wondering throughout the whole thing what's real and what's an illusion and then grabs you in the end with the truth that was there the whole time. I highly recommend this movie!
B000G09OEC|5.0|Muse broke out internationally with their stellar third album \\"Absolution,\\" after two albums of just-as-good-but-not-well-known work.<br /><br />Now they've returned with \\"Black Holes and Revelations,\\" a simmering symphonic rock tapestry that expands their sound into darker territory. It's also more electronic in nature, but the core of the band still lies in their magnificent, haunting rock'n'roll and classical arrangements.<br /><br />It opens with a rippling keyboard melody, which blooms out into a soaring guitar melody and lots of blippy electronica. That feeling only grows as Matthew Bellamy starts to sing of death, damnation, and corruption. \\"You behold/And beholden for all that you've done/And spin/Cast a spell/Cast a spell on the country you run/And risk/You will risk/You will risk all their lives and their souls...\\" Political? Sounds like it.<br /><br />Muse heads towards more pleasant territory in the bittersweet, yearning \\"Starlight,\\" as well as soft mournful balladry, and wistful pop that blossoms out into spare, sizzling electro-rock. Bellamy shows the beauty in the bleakness when he sings, \\"During the struggle/They will pull us down... Let's use this chance/To turn things around/And tonight/We can truly say/Together we're invincible.\\"<br /><br />But the heart of Muse is still in rock'n'roll, like Led Zeppelin fronted by Beethoven. They still specialize in walls of embroidered sound, like elaborate rock tapestries. They play symphonic rock that sweeps all over the board, explosive bass-laden rockers, and fast-paced violin rock that ends with a whisper.<br /><br />Muse hasn't abandoned their sound in order to go mainstream, even after making it big on this side of the pond. Their music is still dark, lacking in hope, and meditates on wastelands, glaciers and how \\"There's no justice in the world/And there never was.\\" In case you were wondering, this is not fun music.<br /><br />Don't be worried about the electronica. Muse only really goes dancy on one song: the twisted love song \\"Supermassive,\\" which has a hypnotic dark beat. The rest of the time, it's just another instrument in the mix. Alongside the typical rock instruments, Muse adds in cascading piano and violins, as well as a glorious trumpet and some gypsyish acoustic guitar.<br /><br />Matt Bellamy has that soaring, angsty voice that would sound emo if it weren't so powerful. As it is, his pipes are strong enough to soar over the complex hard-rock, but can also drop down to a soft ballad. \\"You'll have to set us free/Watch our souls fade away/Let our bodies crumble away/Don't be afraid/I will take the cold for you...\\"<br /><br />Muse score another win in their dark, powerful fourth album, full of spacey electronica and sweeping hard rock.

B000H0MKOC|5.0|`Thank You for Smoking' is one of the funniest and freshest comedies I've seen in a long time.  It's smart and witty and capitalizes on its assets brilliantly, leading Aaron Eckhart to what has to be is greatest performance to date (a Golden Globe nod should be a lock at this point).  As Nick Naylor, Eckhart is smart, effective and confident as the voice behind big tobacco.  He's so into his job that he even goes as far as to somewhat promote smoking to his son's elementary class.  Nick regularly meets with his fellow lobbyists (David Koechner & Maria Bello) for lunch, donning the name MOD squad (merchants of death), where they discuss and or compete for the greatest death count. <br /> <br />When Nick becomes involved with a reporter (Katie Holmes at her most delicious...screw you Tom Cruise) things slowly spiral out of control, and as his son (Cameron Bright) becomes all the more interested in his fathers line of work Nick begins to wonder if he's really setting the right example for his son.  He goes from shameless to selfless by the end of the film, but he does it all with his confident yet cocky demeanor.  The film was a riot, I mean utterly hysterical from start to finish (Rob Lowe was brilliant as the Asian obsessed motion picture tycoon...I mean that whole Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones discussion was priceless), and it was original enough to deem itself worthy of multiple viewings.  A wonderful surprise...highly recommended.
B000GFLKF8|5.0|Spike hit the mark on this tense and complex thriller. The perfect bank heist, with the cops and bank officials all twirling in their tracks, except for one man, the one whose secrets are at risk. Good performances by Denzel, Jodie and cast and some nice surprises at the end. I've watched this movie twice and not been bored for a moment. Great Job!
B000A7Q2DM|3.0|its not bad but its not the best.  i used to love 30 seconds to mars when their second cd came out, but by the time i had listened to it a couple of times i was awfully tired of jared leto being so loud on the songs' choruses.  he just gets so monotonous. <br /> <br />other than the loudness and same old sound that jared leto gives to some of the choruses, they are allright.  not bad but its not the best. <br /> <br />props to the drummer though, i love his work in the album.
B000069KGM|5.0|o.k. we all know the cr*p that Chicago would come to be known for in the 80's...<br /><br />Luckily, I'm just old enough to actually remember when tunes from the first few Chicago albums were still playing on pop radio (I was VERY young... but I remember - - 25 or 6 to 4 and Saturday In The Park in particular.)<br /><br />This said, listening to this album is really exciting when you realize it was the roots of a revolution, something completely new, very experimental, different - - groundbreaking.  In many ways a product of its era (very message oriented, experimental and political) at the same time the music came from so many different directions...  and so much was happening.  10 years later what went wrong - - all theories aside (including Kath's tragic death) my guess is that it had every much to do with the changing of an era, than anything artistic... How sad!  If you can associate with this album then, you were \\"with it\\", today you're probably VERY out of place with a world that has changed... No one is asking Questions 67 or 68 anymore (and the drugs that the group wrote about in a later album are no longer hip.)  As for words like \\"Liberation\\", talk of revolution - - and philosophical ponderences about the superficialities of daily life... forget it.  - - as for the other elements - - college appealing Jazz/Rock, a guitar hero who was even respected by Jimi Hendricks and two great lead vocalists... not to mention a tight but unique and highly experiental rhythm section - - not as \\"superficially\\" technical as Blood Sweat and Tears, but very deep and adept a creating a sound that definitely had its roots in psychadelic rock and Jazz, but was borrowing from everything from pop to Varese - - oh and all the hair... wow... its almost as if the ALBUM is as alive as ever when you listen to it, but the world has foresaken its truths.<br /><br />Though listening to this album only drills in the tragedy of the big sell out (*at the expense of not becoming a starving oldies group) - - the truth is that in its early years Chicago was a machine that could created its own brand of chart friendly yet politically and musically heavy rock and pop music.  - - The idea of a band being both \\"experimental\\" yet being a pop power house - - now that's something to be amazed about (of course, it was the trend with most of the groups of the era but these guys managed to hang in through the '70s and keep on doing long after Woodstack.)  Will it happen again?

0743442539|5.0|Le Carre is probably the best spy storyteller out there; and no doubt \\"The Spy Who Came from the Cold\\" is his finest hour. <br /> <br />This is not your typical James Bond fireworks and action packed waste of time. Here we deal with flesh and blood spies with their troubles and tribulations and ultimately with the morals of it all.  <br />Le Carre takes us inside the mind of a spy and the ongoing inner battle of what he is supposed to do and what is right to do. It is superbly done; maybe because le Carre was a spy himself. <br /> <br />This is a bittersweet book; but a must if you love the spy genre. Just be prepared for a change of pace, <br />
B000AL730O|2.0|i bought this record i don't know why. i heard a few tracks and thought it sounded ok. <br />i listened to it once and it sounded so blase. i don't really know what i expected. i have add so sometimes lyrics don't really matter-- the rocking of the music does, which may be why i like jazz so much, because it doesn't have words. neither here nor there. <br />any way: and yes i know this isn't really much of a review: i think this is a record the casual observer may pick up for whatever reason and thrust aside. i think this is one that one must make a conscious effort to listen to and appreciate for what it is. <br />first listenl-- not impressed. but give it a chance. <br />
B000066C1N|5.0|Wow, this soundtrack is every bit as thrilling as the movie itself. Bryan Adams is an incredible singer, and Hans Zimmer is an amazing composer. Both guys are total geniuses in the field of music. There isn't a single song on this soundtrack that I don't enjoy listening to. This music definitely makes you feel like you're out in the old west, racing with the horses, soaring with the eagles, chasing the very wind itself. It's like you're really there.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, the only people who don't like this soundtrack have never listened to it.
B000002GIE|5.0|The S/T first effort by one of the most talented rock bands of the 80s/90s. Though not their best album (by far) this record showed the song-writing prowess of this incredible band, and displayed the potential that would come to fruition on their later releases. Many dismiss this album, and the song-writing, as sophmoric and immature, even cheesy. I disagree. <br /> <br />Extreme has always had the ability to write and compose songs that seem simple, even shallow on the surface, but that have much deeper meanings, and are themed much more seriously upon closer examination. Wind Me Up, Play With Me, and Flesh N Blood are examples of this, though they delve into the sexual double entrende. But this concept is displayed most strongly on the emotional ballad Rock A Bye Bye. On the surface seemingly just a play on the lullaby Rock A Baby, this song tackles the difficult issue of abortion, but from the fetus' point-of-view. Extremely (pun intended) powerful and moving. <br /> <br />Sure there are a lot of 80s metal riffs and standards here. But when you look at these songs closely you can see much more at work than first meets the eye, something the band would use to the fullest on their next two albums.  <br /> <br />And, of cours,e they took a huge risk by including a song (Watching, Waiting) based on Christian theology. The song is very powerful and the vocals are arranged very well, as Nuno (guitarist) sings this song as a duet with Gary (lead singer). <br /> <br />This is a must have for any Extreme fan, and is strongly recommended for those drawn to the 80s metal (hair band) sound, but that want that sound with a little more depth than traditionally provided by these types of bands.
0312995423|3.0|The National Security Agency's new and mighty code-cracking computer, TRANSLTR, has been working on a single puzzle for so long that the top cryptographer at \\"No Such Agency\\" (as it's nicknamed) can't believe her eyes when she sees its time elapsed counter. Her boss, Deputy Director Strathmore, has called her in on a Saturday because he trusts his protege to help him obtain the algorithm's pass-key without letting anyone else know what's going on. This algorithm, called Digital Fortress, is billed by its creator - a disgruntled and idealistic former NSA employee - as the only uncrackable encryption code ever written. Strathmore has fed it into TRANSLTR to test that claim. He must have the pass-key to carry out his plan for Digital Fortress, assuming it really can't be broken.<br /><br />The story that flows from this setup has a rapid pace, plus plenty of twists and turns. While the characters aren't deep, their behavior makes sense within the framework provided. My only disappointment consisted of one enormous continuity error, and I obviously can't be more specific in a review without giving too much of the plot away. It didn't spoil the book, but it did have me saying a rather loud, \\"HUH?\\"<br /><br />Enjoyable overall, with a satisfying resolution at the end.
B000HT386M|4.0|I knew CLICK would be funny and it was. It had plenty of the gags, plays on words, physical comedy, and potty humor. But it had so much more than Adam Sandler movies usually have, also.    Right now, I would say this - If you love all the above things that make you chuckle about Sandler's movies like Happy Gilmore that's okay. Those are laugh out loud funny movies. But is that all you want? Maybe you don't want to see more than that. That's okay. Take or leave this movie.    If you want all that and much more - you have to see this movie. It had plenty of laughs but it was certainly not a straight up comedy. It had much meaning - and it was a surprise. It drove the point home that we all are chasing so many things like money and than we lose touch with everything else. This was a moving experience for me. Will it be for you? I don't know. But will it be a movie with a lot more than you bargained for that makes you think? Definitely.    I could say so much about this movie - I like it more and more actually after seeing it. This movie may appear to be another \\"Chistmas Carol\\" (Scrooge), or even another \\"Bruce Almighty\\" but its not at all. (i.e. movies in general where the main character goes thru some quirky incident to have a great alterted view of life). This movie works in so much of a new, fresh, and believable way. When I was watching - I really didn't know if this this man was going to make it out without a tragic life.    Bottom Line: If you want Happy Gilmore and nothing else. Fine. Don't watch this movie. If you are open to a Sandler comedy that goes further in meaning than Big Daddy or 100 first dates - buy this DVD now.     *** I wanted to ammend to my original review. Everything I said earlier is absolutely true. However, looking back, the reason that I gave this  four stars instead of five was because I was turned off by some of the crude humor and cursing. These things did lower the enjoyment of CLICK!***

B000E994KE|5.0|Reviewgium - Volume I, issue II<br /><br />Amorphis has returned with a new singer and consequently, a heavier and more vigorous album. Eclipse has a very refined and well-produced sound with strong, melodic songs, and powerful vocals.<br /><br />The album starts with an eerie synthesizer intro that leads into the driving beat of \\"Two Moons,\\" a song rich with pounding riffage and heavy, gritty vocals. \\"House of Sleep\\" follows quickly with a catchy, melodic guitar rhythm, and delivers great vocal harmonies throughout. About 2/3 into the song, an ethereal keyboard/synthesizer duet segues into one of the album's many clever key shifts. As \\"Leaves Scar\\" begins with a soft airy melody, it seems you are going to get a little break from the action...but no...a heavy riff begins and ushers in a nice, brutal death vocal verse, eliminating any doubt that Amorphis is fooling around with this album. Adding to the brutality is the explosive \\"Perkele,\\" and almost highlandish \\"Brother Moon,\\" as well as the album highlight \\"The Smoke.\\" Things slow down, but do not lessen in intensity, with the songs \\"Under a Soul and Black Stone,\\" and \\"Same Flesh,\\" and the album finishes off with the fundamental rocker \\"Empty Opening\\" and somewhat inconsequential bonus track \\"Stone Woman.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend this album to new listeners and older fans alike. Whatever edge and intensity Amorphis may have lost with the last few albums, they have regained with Eclipse. Again, it is more refined and a better quality album soundwise than say, Elegy. Take that as you will.
B00022MUTU|5.0|I love these headphones I've had them for about a week and listend to them about 2hrs each day so I know what they're capable of. They are extremely comfortable and adjust automatically to fit your head (nice feature). Sound clarity is excellent I found that I could hear sounds in songs that I was unable to before. I listen to many different genres of music and I can say that the 240's are great for anything. It has just enough bass for rap and techno, and enough clarity and power for metal. If your budget is around $100 for headphones I would highly suggest these they do everything you could ask of them. They also come with a 2 year warranty. THE ONLY NEGATIVE THING I can say is that they come with a crappy cord, I would much rather of had a spiraled cord. Thankfully the cord is detachable so I will be buying a better cord for them. So if your in the market for these I would say, buy them.

B00001X591|3.0|Hogwood, Manze, Bernardini : with a list a stars of baroque music like this, I was thinking that I will hear some firework ! Unfortunetely,it is not the case here. It'not the fault of Hogwood. He has his usual ardour. We can feel his energy. No, I think the main problem is the composer, Tomaso Albinoni, himself. He does not authorize madness in exhibition, in virtuosity demonstration, and alas, in excess. <br />So the (beautiful) violon of Manze stay as good as gold ! The latter try to put, in the concertos number 1, 4, 7 and 10 , the maximum of energy he could in the spirit of the music written by the composer; but we stay on our appetite. <br /> <br />The oboes of Bruine and Bernardini, which have a huge place in this program, are sweet but not astounding.  <br /> <br />The slow movements are very beautiful.  <br /> <br />So, this music is pleasant but do not expect virtuosity here.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|Reviewgium - Volume I, issue IX<br /><br />Like them or not, it looks like Pearl Jam is not going anywhere. I will forego all allusions to the \\"x-fans\\" who no longer like the band simply because they cannot seem to deal with the fact that Pearl Jam will probably never again release another album identical to Ten or Vs. in style or potency. However, their eponymous eighth studio album is probably the closest thing to such a return as has been seen in quite some time.<br /><br />Leave it to the radio to take the worst songs from the album and turn them into hits. Of course I am speaking of \\"Life Wasted\\" and \\"World Wide Suicide,\\" two mediocre songs that provide a somewhat inappropriate start to the album, and almost turned me off to the album upon my first listen. But fortunately I continued to listen, because there are some classic Pearl Jam gems that follow. \\"Comatose\\" has a very Vitalogy feel to it, reminiscent of \\"Spin the Black Circle,\\" but not in a repetitive way. The upbeat \\"Severed Hand\\" and \\"Unemployable\\" are definitely album highlights, and are currently vying as my favorite songs of the album. \\"Marker In the Sand\\" has a kind of classic rock groove to it, as does the more mellow \\"Parachutes.\\" Pearl Jam continues to fit in political overtones into their songs, as seen in \\"Army Reserve\\" and the slower, more subtle \\"Gone.\\" \\"Come Back\\" is very slow and seems to drag on...not a particularly great song, but around the 4:00 minute mark, there is a really great guitar interlude that makes the song worth listening to. Like \\"Comatose,\\" \\"Inside Job\\" also has an older Pearl Jam vibe to it, once you get past the long intro.<br /><br />Unlike the last two Pearl Jam albums, this one contains better musicianship, more variation, and better constructed songs. The singing is better, the guitar work is better with more soloing, it is just much better over all. This album is probably the best since No Code and definitely gets my recommendation, but you have to give it a chance. If you can get past the first two songs, it is a rewarding and enjoyable album, with songs that translate very well live--which I can say from experience. I almost feel like I am skimping them by giving a 7.5 rating and not something a bit higher, because the album seems to get better upon multiple listens.ance.

0393327655|4.0|This is a provocative book - intentionally so - that hits the mark pretty much dead on.  Harris argues with patient reason and considerable humor that we, as a nation and a global culture, have suffered terribly as a result of our deeply ingrained religious baggage.  He argues persuasively for us to free ourselves of these persistent belief systems in order to rise above the intolerance and ignorance they too often promote.  Most readers will be challenged, and many offended, by these arguments, but they will find it difficult to rationally refute them without lapsing into defenses of their preconceived belief systems.  I found the book weakest in its stretch to address consciousness, and to contrast mysticism with religion, but these are relatively minor quibbles that detract only somewhat from the broad suite of empirical evidence Harris brings to the table (augmented with over 60 pages of supporting notes).  The sooner we turn the corner on the road Harris lays out, the better we will all be in the long run.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|As a die hard Rush, Queensryche, Jethro Tull, et al fan, I've been worried about who would be filling this musical void as they get further and farther between recordings.  Even though DT has been around, I never seemed to get into them - Until I heard 'As I Am' from Train of Thought.  Considering the first album I purchased was Black Sabbath - Paranoid, I was really into the heavy sound of this recording mixed with the technical wizadry that DT has been known for.  Then came the Live at Budokan DVD where I saw the amazing musicianship for the first time.  Now, with the release of Octavarium and the Score DVD (The Root of All Evil is now one of my top ten favorite songs), I'm hooked.  For an old headbanger, you really can't get too heavy when you add in quality singing and complex arrangements.  DT's got another fan thanks to Train of Thought.
B000EULJLU|3.0|Reviewgium - Volume I, issue V<br /><br />After yet another long hiatus, Tool returns to claim another multi-million dollar paycheck, and then most likely formulaically disappear for another five years or so, resurfacing once again when their overly-exuberant and more-than-gullible fanbase goes overboard with breakup rumors and the like. It's a continuous and predictable cycle. 10K Days seems to indicate to me that Tool has passed their prime and are now beginning a downward slope. Sure, we get the typical complex and multi-faceted material, as they continue to push the boundaries of just how progressive and creative a mainstream rock band can be. Yet, while 10K Days can be considered original material, there is really no distinguishing quality to the album that makes it a unique entity, as were the previous Tool albums. Maybe this seems a bit harsh of a judgement, but for a band that takes huge breaks between albums, it should be expected that they could and would conjure up material that is more interesting and spell-binding than what was unveiled here.<br /><br />That aside, there are some very good tracks on the album, particularly the riff-laden \\"Jambi,\\" the dramatic epic title track, and the sinister \\"Right In Two.\\" Of course, \\"Vicarious\\" and \\"The Pot\\" have experienced major radio success, but I would hardly consider them album highlights. The first is an obvious radio/chart hook, and the latter an odd, detached tune with a somewhat uncharacteristic vocal line, providing a sound that-while unique-does not really fit in well with the rest of the album. Besides that, it is not a great or even good song by any stretch of the imagination. \\"Wings for Marie\\" was really the first track to spark my interest upon my initial listen. The brooding melody may be a bit boring for the radio masses, but there is an element of classic Toolish mystery that I cannot help but enjoy. This of course extends into the song's sequel, the title track. At over 11 minutes, it may be a bit too drawn out for the casual listener, but the more patient listener will appreciate the gradual and dramatic crescendo that continues to build, experiencing a minor climax just about at the halfway point of the song right after a delicious vocal moment that blends with the instrumentation so well, it is almost a difficult task to distinguish between the two. The crescendo continues, climaxing in full at about the 8-9-minute mark with a series of driving chords. Then the song dissipates like ripples in the water to a solemn ending. \\"Lipan Conjuring,\\" Lost Keys,\\" \\"Intension\\"...typical ambiguously introspective Tool filler material that may provide a contribution to the album on a whole (albeit a negligible one), but still does not feel necessary. However, \\"Lost Keys\\" serves a purpose in that it is an intro to \\"Rosetta Stoned,\\" an interesting, enigmatic track that provides some much-needed evil energy to the album.<br /><br />As far as my recommendation goes, let me just say this. This is probably Tool's worst album to date. As a fan, I still like it to an extent, but I am not blinded by Tool's gimmicks. They have a set and cyclic plan for their career, and it is fulfilled every time they release an album. Are they overrated? Well, that is a touchy question, and if they are, it is not necessarily their fault. They are not gods; they are not geniuses, in the strictly musical sense, that is. What they are and always have been is a mainstream-focused band that just happens to have clever song-writing and artistic abilities that set them above the ocean of generic popular bands that comprise a major slice of the mainstream pie. They are geniuses in that they are able to draw fans not only from the mainstream masses with their radio hits, but also from all branches of the seamy music underground: fans who thrive on deeply over-analyzing the albums on a whole. This is why Tool will always win, and the sub-par 10,000 Days has proven it.a bit too drawn out for the casual listener, but the more patient listener will appreciate the gradual and dramatic crescendo that continues to build, experiencing a minor climax just about at the halfway point of the song right after a delicious vocal moment that blends with the instrumentation so well, it is almost a difficult task to distinguish between the two.

0143034901|4.0|This is indeed an immensely luxurious and brilliantly written read.  However, and this may be due to my limited critical faculties; I felt that it suffered somewhat due to the writer's brilliant and seemingly limitless imaginative skills.  Shouldn't a well written and absorbing work take one effortlessly from beginning to end without the writer's hand being obvious as he changes gear? And Carlos Ruiz Zaf&uuml;n changes gear and opens new vistas at every turn, going off at yet another tangent with, as Stephen King so rightly says on the cover blurb; \\"Where even the subplots have subplots\\".<br /><br />At one stage, somewhere in the middle of this 506 page novel, I almost gave it up. This was not only due to the difficulty in keeping up with the twists of direction the novel made and the ever increasing flow of new characters walking in and off the pages, but mainly because I thought I could feel the writer's imaginative processes at work and that he himself had lost his way and had distanced himself from his story's original theme.<br /><br />However, I'm pleased that I stayed with it, for somehow he performs the impossible and ties up all those loose ends with charmed, lyrical and wise writing.  There are many times in this novel when the writing and insights into the human experience are so very good that you yourself mentally confirm them with an acknowledging .... Ahh.<br /><br />Bottom line (pun intended) ... well worth the effort.
B000HCO840|2.0|As a DVD collector, I was more than willing to fork over the extra ten dollars to pick up the X-Men: The Last Stand Collector's Edition. Unforntunately, I have never been more disappointed.  <br />Don't get me wrong, the movie is pretty good, and worth picking up, but the Collector's Edition is definitely not worth the money. The only difference between it and the regular widescreen version is a fancy box and a mini-comic book. No extras, no special features disc, nothing. Really, who would pay ten bucks for a comic book? Don't let the pretty packaging fool you; the regular version has all the same material on it as the collector disc. I hope this will help someone save a little money.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|Reviewgium - Volume I, issue XII<br /><br />Pink Floyd mainman David Gilmour returns with his third solo album, his first in over twenty years. Light a candle in the dark, lay back, let go of all your worries and burdens, and go to a place where life's hassles melt away and nothing matters except for the moment you are in. Full of pleasant soundscapes, textured instrumentation, and excellent vocal harmonies, On an Island can take you there if you just let it.<br /><br />The album starts with the atmospheric soundscape \\"Castellorizon,\\" overlain with a melodic guitar solo and orchestration that flows gently into the title track, a harmonious triumph featuring guest appearances by David Crosby and Graham Nash. The elation continues on in the mystifying song \\"The Blue,\\" which contains some truly melting lap steel soloing. The pace picks up a bit with \\"Take a Breath,\\" with its simple yet entrancing acoustic guitar riff, giving an edge of adventure to this isolated getaway. \\"Red Sky at Night\\" is a saxophone-led segue that leads you placcidly into \\"This Heaven,\\" a song which adds an element of fun and enjoyment to the journey. After you've had your fill of bread and wine with that someone special, sit back on your patio and let the pristine night air of \\"Then I Close My Eyes\\" and \\"Smile\\" take you even deeper into that carefree paradise you have found. \\"A Pocketful of Stones\\" is my definite favorite track. It starts off simple with an airy orchestration, easy piano melody and vocal line, but Gilmour's vocals just really reach a whole other level right about at the three-minute mark, and the song ends with a perfectly-placed guitar solo, making this one of the most gorgeous songs that has graced my ears in quite a while. As we know, good things do not last forever, but the final track \\"Where We Start\\" kind of gives you the spark of hope that maybe...just maybe...this will last forever. Maybe everything will be all right in the world. \\"We walk ourselves weary, just you and I, there's just this moment...\\"<br /><br />I'll get right to the point: David Gilmour sounds just as good vocally and on the guitar as he did 30 years ago. His vocals and guitarwork on this album just further the long-running fact that he is one of the greatest rock musicians that has ever been. Although the album may slightly remind one of Pink Floyd at times, it is obviously not as dark, gloomy, or mysterious. As opposed to the music typical of x-bandmate Roger Waters, who always seems to have a message to relay, there is no deep meaning or philosophy to anything in On and Island. And none is needed: it delivers exactly what it promises. There is also a special edition with a bonus song called \\"Island Jam\\" which is pretty much just that: an instrumental jam based on the other music of the album. It is a good compliment to the album, but not entirely necessary if you cannot find it. I recommend this album to anyone and everyone. Even to those people who think that everything about music needs to be complex and contain a deep message of some kind. Take a vacation from that for once, and enjoy the stripped-down beauty of this musical paradise. Light a candle in the dark, lay back, let go...d I, there's just this moment...\\" <br /> <br />I'll get right to the point: David Gilmour sounds just as good vocally and on the guitar as he did 30 years ago.

0618680004|2.0|I have read about the first 80 pages of this so far and I remain unimpressed. The criticisms against religion used so far have all been rehashed long before Mr. Dawkins was born. Voltaire and especially Thomas Paine rolled out many of them. Thomas Jefferson and America's founding fathers are also quoted much too much, evidence, to me, that Dawkins uses the old rhetorical trick of appealing to authority. Why should an Englishman quote Jefferson who was engaged in armed rebellion against the lawful authority? Why does he set up so many straw men to knock them down?<br /><br />These straw men include Swinbourne, an English theologian, who seems to be rather dense. Bertrand Russell, the philosopher, has always struck me as a lightweight but Dawkins is happy to haul him in. Ditto Einstein.<br /><br />A scientist, if such he is, should use scientific methodology (and I know later chapters will prattle on about evolution). But complex systems must be explained by  simple premises or axioms. Euclid famously had only five such axioms, one of which was redundant. Dawkins seems to abandon the reductionist sciences and concentrate on the complex one of evolution. But evolution has only been with us for a little over 150 years and the flawed system of the Greeks was with us a lot longer. Evolution is deterministic and we should be past that in science. I would say God plays dice but Dawkins would object to my use of that word.<br /><br />I object to Dawkins labeling ethnic conflicts - the north of Ireland, Israel/Palestine, Iraq, the war of the Yugoslav succession as being religious as they were ethnic, political conflicts where outside political powers fuelled the fires.  Dawkins massages the data there to fit his agenda, which is not very scientific and is quite sloppy.<br /><br />So, is God a delusion? Maybe but Dawkins goes about it the wrong way. Much of the book is quite funny as there is plenty of scope to display undergrad witticisms here. But Dawkins, as a scientist, should be above that. He chides Euler for cheating Diderot. But maybe Dawkins cheats us by rhetorical sleights of hand that belong more in the Oxford Union than in what should be a serious, scientific book. Less quips and more science please.<br /><br />I have read many of Dawkins' popular books and they do seem a little on the light side, what with memes and the continual mantra of Darwin's brilliance. I am glad I bought the book but I wish it had a more coherent framework to it. He has divided up the book into handy chapters and the chapters into sub sections. It is easy to read but he jumps from America's founding fathers to orbiting teapots to Commons' jokes at Oxford. He is also a tad too fond of quoting his friends quoting him. Trivial criticisms perhaps but a lot of the book is trivial. A more turgid, pedantic and comprehensive rebuttal of religion might have been a better project than this one which s aimed at the general public, which Dawkins seems to despise when they believe in religions other than his.that.

0739340131|5.0|I bought this book on CD to listen to on my last drive from Florida to North Carolina and was so happy I did. The story was great and the fact that each charater (almost) was a different person really made all the difference. After listening to many books on CD with the reader changing their voice for different charaters-sometimes badly- this was a delightful change. I was sorry when it ended!
B00000099Y|5.0|This CD has been in my 1000-disk collection for a decade.   <br /> <br />I have listened to it more times than half of my entire music collection combined.    <br /> <br />I have probably listened to it 50 times as much as my next most-played disk. <br /> <br />I doubt the next decade will be any different. <br /> <br />
B00005JKJA|3.0|There are undeniably interesting set-pieces in this film as there are also undeniably awful ones. Lynch, presumably presented this one as an oblique head-scratcher and it is. I'm not convinced, as some viewers seem to be, that it means anything. Each inpretation seems to present holes of their own. All in all, cinephiles should find more than a scene or two to enjoy as long as one loses all expectations that there is any guarantee of relation to the rest of the film.
B00005CDNF|5.0|Updated Review - 2014<br /><br />Released in 1975, ABBA's third album showcases Bjorn and Benny's songwriting genius and Agnetha's and Frida's glittering vocals. It also spawned several songs that would become international hits.<br /><br />ABBA's previous albums featured Bjorn in many of the lead vocals. However, both men finally realized that a contributing factor to ABBA's appeal laid with the combined voices of the 2 women since they were, by far, the better singers. From 1975 onward, it would be the 2 girls who would be their featured vocalists with Bjorn having one or two solos per album.<br /><br />ABBA (1975) is a consistently great album. From start to finish it offers tunes that are melodic with soaring harmonies and since Agnetha and Frida sing most of these songs (Bjorn has 2 solos), the album as a whole, benefits from their strong vocal performances. One of the biggest international hits to emerge from this album was \\"Mamma Mia\\" which became the quartet's second chart-topper in the UK and topped the charts in several other countries. The single also became a medium-sized hit in North America where it peaked at #32 in the US and #20 in Canada. The infectious melody and charming vocals would make this one of ABBA's most cherished songs. Another international hit included here is \\"SOS\\" which features Agnetha as lead vocalist. This gorgeous song is not only infectious but it overflows with emotion (thanks to Agentha's vocals) and the chorus with its harmonies is fantastic. \\"SOS is arguably one of their best songs and a personal favorite of mine. \\"SOS\\" became ABBA's second biggest international hit (after \\"Waterloo) at the time. It reached the Top 10 in several countries including the UK (#6) and Canada (#9) and the Top 40 in the US (#15). Another ABBA gem included in this album is \\"I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do\\". The song was only a mild hit in the UK where it peaked outside the Top 30 but was a much bigger hit in other territories including North America where it reached the Top 20 (#15 US, #12 CAN).<br /><br />Hits aside, there are several other songs in ABBA (1975) that are worthy of your time such as \\"Hey, Hey, Helen\\" which features solid, more grittier vocals by the girl, \\"Bang-A-Boomerang\\", the Bjorn lead track \\"Rock Me\\", the gorgeous \\"I've Been Waiting for You\\" and the under-rated \\"So Long\\".<br /><br />There are several re-mastered versions of this album. The earlier re-mastered edition featured several songs taken from ABBA's previous albums, \\"Ring Ring\\" and \\"Waterloo\\" and 2 new bonus tracks; \\"Crazy World\\" and \\"Folk Medley-Pick a Bale of Cotton/On Top of Old Smokey/Midnight Special\\". The later issue only has the latter two as bonus tracks. There is also the deluxe edition which is much pricier but if you can find it, it is recommended. It features a bonus DVD with previously unreleased television performances.<br /><br />When you compare this album to ABBA's later ones such as \\"Super Trouper\\" and \\"The Visitors\\", you can clearly see how their music evolved. ABBA in the mid 70's was almost a completely different band. During this time they were content in creating pop songs that were perfectly crafted, enjoyable and well sung. Lyrically, they were not as meaningful as their later pieces but in this stage of their career, they were just having fun and that is clearly evident in this album.<br /><br />Highly Recommended0 (#15 US, #12 CAN).

B00005JLEU|5.0|A beautifully realized excursion into a magical world. My attention never wavered as I was struck by one completely unfamiliar concept or scene after another. Often fantasy works leave me a bit cold with the Shakespearean posturing and ambiguous dangers that any variety of spells can be used to bail out of but, this matter-of-fact tale of wonder needs no pretensions and achieves majesty quite easily.
B000EGDC14|3.0|If there's anyone else who found some things that were likeable about Black Cherry, but felt wholly disappointed to have lost the beautiful, haunting quality of Felt Mountain, despair further. This rehashing of 80's pop mixed with modern techno continues, inticating that the fame Goldfrapp found through Black Cherry has spurred them to continue the same sound. Unfortunately it appears that the enchantment of Goldfrapp's first CD won't be repeated, as its soft melodies never captured public interest the way Black Cherry did.
B000002GB2|4.0|This was the major label debut for Styx, who had released 4 albums on Wooden Nickel/RCA with moderate success; the breakthrough that A&M records wanted would come later.  This album, however, is a very good album that was much more successful in Canada than the United States. \\"Suite Madame Blue\\" was, in the late 70's in Montreal, as essential a party song as \\"Stairway To Heaven\\".  \\"Lonely Child\\" and \\"Lorelei\\" were also outstanding songs and \\"Light Up\\" was a concert favorite for years.  The sound is rather dated today, and they probably had more emphasis on synthesizers on this album than any other; but when you place the emphasis on the songs in their pure form, this is clearly one of Styx's best efforts.

B000002UAU|5.0|My title says it all.  As a music historian, the release of this album is one of my top 10 moments in the history of recorded music, because it did something that only a handful of other albums ever did - it changed the entire industry.  Until 1967, albums by \\"youth-oriented\\" artists were rarely more than collections of singles and never seemed to have much flow or continuity - in other words, nothing more than miniature greatest hits collections.  But on June 1 of 1967, the Beatles changed everything.  Other artists were expanding their horizons as well - the Beach Boys had released Pet Sounds, a bold experiment of sounds mixed with songwriting we had never realized was possible from a young artist.  But the mammoth success of Sergeant Pepper would make other albums like this marketable - and it would lead to other recording stars to become artists as much as entertainers.<br /><br />What makes Sergeant Pepper so stunning?  Strong and detailed songwriting, diversity of style, outstanding musicianship and a bold desire to experiment.  The sense that it was also a \\"concept\\" album led to much more as well, and what better concept than an autobiography?  This just adds to the legend.<br /><br />Here's a different spin, though, on why this album is the legend it is.  It's the simple unity of the group, which in several ways reached its peak at this time in their history.  They were drawn together by the dissolution of their personal relationships, as well as the absence of privacy in their lives (read the lyrics to \\"Fixing A Hole\\").  Keep in mind, as well, that a mere 9 months earlier, they had completed their final tour together.  Now, they were enjoying their time together more than they had since their pre-fame days; this reflects in \\"A Little Help From My Friends\\", \\"Getting Better\\" and \\"Within You Without You\\".  They experimented with drugs together, producing \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\" and \\"A Day In The Life\\".  And they dreamed of a better life through \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" and \\"Lovely Rita\\".<br /><br />No doubt, this is one of the most analyzed albums of all time and will continue to be for ages to come.  And the biggest reason of all is that there wasn't an album by pop stars before it that truly NEEDED to be analyzed.  Nothing was the same after this album - which is why Rolling Stone named it the greatest album of all time.

B000009HF2|5.0|Way back in the dark ages of 1976, when I was significantly younger, this album was played everywhere.  The album went to number one on the charts and became the biggest selling live album of all time up to that time.  The album was eventually certified 6 times platinum.<br /><br />The album generated three songs that climbed into the heights of the pop singles chart.  \\"Baby, I Love Your Way\\" reached #12, \\"Do You Feel Like I Do\\" reached #10, and \\"Show me the Way\\" reached #6.  Though these songs are generally mellow, there are heavier elements in the 14+ minute album version of \\"Do You Feel like I Do.\\"  In addition to vibrant elements is the electronically modified voice of Peter Frampton.  The voice modification was a bit of a gimmick, but it fit the song and helped give the album an exuberant frat rock ending that was a part of the charms of the album that kept it at the top of the charts for weeks.<br /><br />The three songs released as singles are standout songs on this CD.  However, there are other songs that are just as fun.  \\"Something's Happening\\" sets the tone for the album with its bouncy, optimistic music and lyrics.  The pace stays fast with \\"Doobie Wah,\\" where Frampton clearly enjoys his vocals and his guitar.  \\"It's a Plain Shame\\" is arena rock at its best.  The first significant change is the ballad \\"All I Want to Be (Is By Your Side).\\"  The pace slows down and Frampton charms his audience with a love song.  \\"Wind of Change\\" is done acoustically and makes a nice change before moving back into faster, harder music.  \\"I Wanna Go to the Sun\\" is the third longest song on this CD as well as being one of the best songs on this album.  I think this song would have done well had it been chosen to be a single.<br /><br />The album takes a brief instrumental interlude with \\"Penny for Your Thoughts.\\"  The guitar on this instrumental is well-played and is short enough to give your brain a rest without being boring.  I do wish the audience noise was reduced during the instrumental.<br /><br />The previous instrumental was a prelude to the rocker \\"(I'll Give You) Money.\\"  This song is a great arena rock song and has nicely executed hard edges to it.  \\"Shine On\\" also keeps to the harder side of rock and maintains a nice pace and is yet another enthusiastic song.  \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" is the second longest song on this CD and is a marvelous interpretation of the Rolling Stones song.  I like covers that bring something new to a song, and Peter Frampton's cover, which adds blues, changes the pace, and has an extended instrumental portion, is unique and enjoyable.  The end of this song has a lot of wailing guitar in a 70s style that is fun for classic rock fans to hear.  The next to the last song on the CD is a beautiful ballad.  \\"Lines on My Face\\" is another song that I think would have made a great single.<br /><br />Live albums rarely sell well on average.  However, occasionally a live album will come along that strikes a chord with the listening public.  \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\" is and album that was perfect for its time and its sales made the album legendary.  While other live albums have surpassed this album in sales, this album remains a great album with a marvelous array of music.  The only thing better than this album is the two disk version, which has even more music on it.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this album to fans of classic rock, arena rock, frat rock, live albums and Peter Frampton.

B000002GB9|4.0|Fuelled by the crossover success of \\"Come Sail Away\\", Styx moved from a modest level of success to stardom with \\"The Grand Illusion\\".  This is the point in Styx's career that has aged the best - several of the songs, notably \\"The Grand Illusion\\", \\"Miss America\\" and \\"Man In The Wilderness\\", still sound fresh today.  Were it not for the weak \\"Superstars\\" and \\"Fooling Yourself\\" (the most dated sounding song on the album), this album would border on 5 stars.  A&M records was becoming impatient with the band and was wanting a bigger seller from the band after \\"Crystal Ball\\".  It remains remarkable to me to this day that the band found a huge breakthrough with the album that - to this point - was the farthest from having a top 40 focus.  For Styx - success was no longer a grand illusion.
0393312836|5.0|This book was way ahead of it's time.  A story of Alex and his gang who was set forth on a mission of ultraviolence.  The book painted a picture of what could happen to kids in a world where violence is toned down to the point where it becomes \\"daily activity\\".  It also gives descent insight into the mind of an Antisocial.  Using a conglomeration of Russian, German, and made up words, Burgess even created a slang talk that enhances the uniquness of this story.  Very cool book, one must pick it up, quick and easy read.
B000002GBB|4.0|After \\"The Grand Illusion\\", Styx now felt the pinch to deliver another multi-platinum album.  It delivered what, in many ways, is their best album.  Tommy Shaw delivered two of Styx's best-known songs, \\"Blue Collar Man\\" and \\"Renegade\\"; James Young delivered another working man's classic with the superb \\"Great White Hope\\"; and Dennis de Young delivered three of his better songs, the cathedral organ showcase \\"I'm OK\\", the biting \\"Pieces of Eight\\" and the hard-rocking \\"Queen of Spades\\".  It's not perfect - but it was an outstanding response to the pressure they must have been feeling.
B0002ZYE1Y|3.0|While I understand how these elements can work (metal guitars, thick drums, orchestral elements, operatic vocals, traditional instruments...) I'm not sure they're used to full effectiveness here. There are a few exceptions to this such as the track \\"The Siren\\" which not only gives each element its own space, but also has some geniune creativity. The big drawback to these guys is their obvious love of everything Hans Zimmer and Trevor Rabin among the other new-world orchestral/electronic/tribal drums/rock elements of film composers. The problem with this is that they don't really create any truely unique music other than perhaps their first go-arounds. I'd like to hear some more interesting ideas in the way of differing chord changes (something other than the boring as anything being touted as solid music in the nu-metal category) and please put and end to the overly used fifth chord finger runs by the keyboardist (this is perhaps the single most annoying element); there is much more dynamic and interesting \\"finger exercises\\" to do on the keyboard than just this. It is to bad that the band fired the lead female singer as she was the most unique part of their band and set them apart from other similar acts such as Epica, Within Temptation, After Forever... Personally I think it would be really interesting if someone like the truely stunning metal band Mastodon, who just can't seem to find their vocal quality yet (which is probably why they have so many \\"guest vocalists\\"), looked at Tarja to maybe do something on their next album (they do seem to be mellowing slightly in their vocals so this could be an advantagious direction). Couple that with say the orchestral stylings of Kronos Quartet... possibilities are endless. I guess what I'm saying is that there is only really one true talent in this act and she's been kicked out of the band. Of course the rest of the members are good musicians but Tarja needs to be placed with some true original musicians, not some Zimmer-with-heavier-guitars wannabes. A perfect example of this is \\"Ghost Love Scene\\" which is this amalgam between \\"The Neverending Story\\" by Limahl (from the movie in the 80's) without the super poppish elements that then flows into a three chord that repeats twice chorus Zimmer rip-off. There are dozens of far more musically interesting directions that this chorus could've gone off on that could've heightened the emotional content and listener's response. I will say this though, the middle orchestral section is quite good; filled with bombast and even some Orf inspired moments of overwhelming crunch. And although the song has these more insipid leanings, it is rather powerful, even with what is there.  <br /> <br />If nothing else, it's nice to hear a live orchestra behind the effort. it really does add the weight that samples still cannot accomplish even with the most expensive of sets.
B000002GB4|3.0|30 years after its release, this album is now only remembered for its exceptional title track.  Upon its release, Styx fans who had loved the band's previous release,  \\"Equinox\\", felt initially that the band was slowly selling out.  The band had been playing with commercial sounds before, but the lyrics were becoming bubblegum on songs like \\"Put Me On\\" and \\"Mademoiselle\\".  At the same time, the title track, the solid \\"Jennifer\\" and the closing track, \\"Ballerina\\", showed some rawer emotions from a band that had generally been known for its working-class style until now.  \\"Crystal Ball\\" is certainly not a disaster for the band; it was simply a so-so step on their journey to arena rock superstardom.
B000GIXEIG|4.0|This movie is a visual masterpiece. The cinematography deserves an award.<br /><br />I also liked that the story was told not as a simple hero tale but as an exploration of the origins of enmity, the consequences of our actions, and the fruits of vengeance.<br /><br />Some reviewers have complained that the rough language is anacronistic for Dark Age Europe; I beg to differ. Most of the curse words we currently use are of Dark Age/Mediaeval origin, although some of them were not necessarily as stigmatized as they are today. Anyone reading Shakespeare will come across them, too. Such words are perfectly scripted for these warriors and heroes, and, yes, the Queen, as well.<br /><br />I'll admit, the accents did throw me off a little; but honestly, a Scottish accent is not really very far removed from Scandinavian - they have common heritage and an ancient history of intermarriage and intertrade. As for the American actress Sarah Polley as the witch, it did seem a bit anacronistic, but accents really don't signify much of anything, especially when we're talking about accents none of us were around to hear. Beowulf was a Geat and Hrothgar a Dane, so it's right that their accents differed. And the witch was neither Geat nor Dane, so it's also right that her accent differ from them both.<br /><br />The departure from the details of the \\"original\\" epic does not bother me. I'm not a literary purist, and I believe a living story is a story that can be adapted and retold as the storyteller sees fit. After all, that's how the tale was told by the Northern skalds in the years before it was written down in one form and petrified. And the heathen tradition in which Beowulf is firmly rooted (despite Christian overlays) is indeed a living one.<br /><br />The fact that the movie does not include Beowulf's later exploits is not a defect; it is the reason the movie is called \\"Beowulf and Grendel\\", as the focus is on that particular episode in the hero's life, and in particular on the nature of the relationship between the two titular characters.

The hall is brand new. In fact, the first time we see it is in the blessing ceremony for opening the newly-constucted hall. This would seem to be a major factor in Grendel's violent rampage: the Danes have moved into new territory and created a mead-hall and township on the border of Grendel's land... land that used to be on the distant outskirts of the kingdom, between Danish civilization and the trolls' wilderness (hence the original run-in with Grendel's dad). The Danes' expanding territory and capital-relocation now creates the circumstances of their demise at the hands of the troll, who previously dared not venture into Daneland to take his revenge but sat nursing his hatred for the intervening years.

0307346609|5.0|World War Z is along the lines of Romero's Dead Series, a horror entertainment with a social commentarial theme. WWZ takes us through the reasons the zombie virus was able to take hold and its really issues that plague our present day society. The War In Iraq, our busy lifestyles, our government's inability to prevent disaster, or at least lessen it's impact, along with the ambiguous attitudes of politicians, and the squandering of public support.  <br />WWZ takes us through the war's history, through the voices of characters from around the world, from China, India, and the U.S. just to name a few, and we are able to see when desperate times really called for some very desperate measures in order for society as a whole to survive, not the attempt to save every single person in any given country. From the Great Panic, to Total War, the Homefront, the eventual reclamation of the world, and the after effects are all chronicled here in the voices of those who bloodied their hands, and devised the plans in order to save humanity.  <br />The book really shows the human condition, our prevelant ability to fight amongst ourselves while the whole world goes to Hell in the literal since, even including the very best in human nature with the very worst, and the alienation of those trying to the very best they can, or the only thing they can to stop the threat, eventhough it may be unpopular. <br />If your a lover of good Zombie fiction, do not pass this one by, this is a very valid interpretation of an Undead War, well as real as one could get. Hopefully the movie rights have already been decided and this slice of Zombism is on its way to the big screen.  <br />The book rightfully pays homage to the original zombie mind of George A. Romero, who took a clumsy, dimwitted monster and turned it into a horror phenomenon the world had never seen, a vehicle for displaying the wrongs and issues in the world.
1401300901|1.0|What a brilliant idea! A guy leaves behind 10 envelopes for his grieving widow to help her over the months following his death. Unfortunately, the writing style of this author is so abysmal that I wonder how on earth she ever got published. Every no-no of creative, good-quality writing is included: long-winded, meaningless dialogue; adverbs by the thousand and Tom Swifties (A guy thinking a girl might sleep with him: \\"I might be onto a good thing there\\" he said cockily.Good grief); absolutely no characterisation, story goals, or regard for grammar.  <br /> <br />Another unintentionally hilarious sentence of very many: \\"He opened the door in his boxer shorts and she stormed past\\".  <br />Where the book tried to be funny it comes across as merely childish, though there are one or two genuinely amusing places. <br />Almost evert paragraph begins with a name or personal pronoun. Even the 15 year olds in my creative writing class can write better than this. Where were the editors when this book was being processed? <br /> <br />As an author, I am often asked how easy it is to get a book published and although I say good writing is no guarantee of acceptance; I also point out that poor writing rarely stands a chance. Clearly I was wrong.  <br />Only the story line makes this book worth anything and it's a sad, sad indictment on our publishing industry that this author wasn't sent home to learn how to do it justice. <br />
B00000K19E|5.0|\\"The Matrix\\" is literally the BEST movie I've ever seen!! I don't know how many times I've seen it: on cinema, on TV, on VCR. Sorry, I don't have a DVD (must be the last person in the Matrix who doesn't!). So why is the movie just GREAT?<br /><br />I guess its the combination. There's really heavy philosophy, astounding special effects, intruiging music, a lot of kung-fu and yes, a lot of completely unmotivated VIOLENCE!!! And, there's no sex. Thanks. Can't stand that in a cinema, I mean really...<br /><br />Best scene: Morpheus is held in custody by the Secret Police. Neo and Trinity has to save him. Catch: the HQ of the Secret Police is guarded by like 1000 cops. Does the rescue mission succeed? Well... Let's just say \\"we need guns, lots of guns\\". And that chopper that collides with the skyscraper...Oh MAAAN!<br /><br />As for the philosophy, being the philosophical type (seriously, I don't take kung fu lessons, not even from Mr. Miyagi), I relished in that too. The Warchowski brothers have succeeded in creating a very clever, almost genial, indeed almost too clever, Gnostic or Hindu-Buddhist allegory. It's all there: the \\"machines\\" who keep humanity in thrall are the Archonts or the Asuras, the Matrix is maya or the world of illusion, Neo is a Gnostic or Tibetan Messiah who acquires superhuman strength when realizing that the world is just an illusion. And yes, the humans who don't want to be saved by Morpheus and his commando group, people like Cipher, well...that's us! \\"Ignorance is bliss\\".<br /><br />And in case you missed it, the movie also contains a really bad joke. Cipher is called \\"Mr.Reagan\\" and wants to \\"forget everything\\" and \\"be someone important, like a movie star\\". This is a reference to Ronald Reagan, the former movie actor and US president who eventually turned senile. Although I didn't fancy Reagan, this joke is...well, a bit low.<br /><br />But despite that, I nevertheless give this movie 5 stars. Indeed, I would give it 10 stars if possible. \\"Wake up...wake up...wake up\\"!!!if possible. \\"Wake up...wake up...wake up\\"!!!  <br />

B000000W5F|5.0|Tattoo You is in my opinion the most underrated Stones ablum and comes very close to living up to their legendary string of studio ablums between '68-'72.  I still think of the ablum in LP format, the two sides possessing very distinct personalities (kind of like Sticky Fingers)  Side A marked by the legendary opening riffs of  Start Me Up, the very enjoyable Hang Fire, Neighbors, and a keith classic and outright great rock song, Little T&A.  Side B is soft and ballad oriented, but continues to grow on you the more you listen to them (similar to many of the tracks on Exile).  This is a great Stones ablum.
0618680004|5.0|While I partially agree with one reviewer who said Dawkins' book was preaching to the choir, I think that it can serve as a very valuable tool for those agnostics out there who can't decide if there is a god or not, or who have decided to take Pascal's wager.  Dawkins clearly  refutes practically all arguments for belief in a supernatural being, including two of the favorites, consolation and inspiration.  Of course, like another reviewer, I can't really see any devout devotee of a religion reading this without a gun to his/her head, because those people are already convinced that they are right, or are simply unwilling to consider the possibility of other realities. <br /> <br />The book was very readible and entertaining and is a worthwhile addition to any critical thinker's library.
0060887303|5.0|I have to say I absolutely loved this book! Since I'm not a teen, I enjoy reading the more scandalous books like The It Girl and Private (by Kate Brian) series. Pretty Little Liars is like a Deperate Housewives for teens in book format. It has all the mystery, secrets, betrayal, and friendships the show has. I highly recommend reading this book and I cannot wait until the sequel comes out next year!
0876852630|5.0|Factotum by Charles Bukowski is not so much a conventional novel as it is a collection of vignettes.  It chronicles the life of Henry Chinaski, author Bukowski's alter ego, as he drifts from job to job in the America of the 1940's.  While his contemporaries are overseas fighting the Germans and the Japanese, Henry remains stateside with a 4F draft classification given him because of unspecified mental health issues.  Henry is not proud of his draft status nor is he ashamed.  To him it is simply another reflection of who he is.  And that attitude is emblematic of the unapologetic tone that characterizes this unusual book from beginning to end.    Though most of the vignettes transpire in Los Angeles, Chinaski's experiences in several other American cities, including but by no means  limited to New York, New Orleans and Miami, are also included.  Just as fish must swim and birds must fly, Henry Chinaski has to do the things he has to do.  What are these mandatory activities?  Quite frankly they are drinking, shacking up with various women and writing...in roughly that order.  The countless menial jobs he takes and rapidly loses are of no interest to him whatsoever.  He views each of them as a diabolically cruel imposition on his time.     Factotum is a fast, easy read containing numerous interesting scenarios, some funny, some tragic, almost all profane.  At no time does the author offer up any apologies for his alter ego's lifestyle and therein lies the book's major strength.    The recently released Matt Dillon movie, though set in the present day, is very true to the novel's unflinching tone.
0689859368|5.0|The Spiderwick Chronicles is a tale about 3 siblings, Jared, Simon and Mallory. The children, along with their mother, move into an old and battered estate, only to find secret creatures milling about everywhere.<br /><br />This book is a wonderful read for all ages. It is filled with an exciting adventure, riddles, mysteries, fun creatures, and a story you will remember. I can't recommend this book enough.
B000G759LW|2.0|I just don't get all the praise for this cd.  I approached this project very enthusiastically and was very disappointed.<br /><br />Granted, Christina can sing - she has a very powerful voice but I find each song to sound alike and starting with her same range roving wail.  It gets old fast.<br /><br />If I heard this cd and didn't know the title, BACK TO BASICS would never have entered my mind.  A true homage to the greats of the past this is not.  I expected a tour de force selection of more modern turns at old time styles putting Christina's range and ability to use.  That this is not.<br /><br />It is a mishmash of songs and now I rarely play it.  Also, the song to her fans was very self gratuitous.  Should have been so much more.
B000GPIPSS|2.0|I appear to have a differing opinion then other reviewers<br />here, but this is what I saw:<br /><br />I just picked up the 75th anniversary edition of Dracula &<br />was a bit surprised at what I found in comparison to the<br />Legacy box set of a couple years back. Amazon's listing<br />states that \\"as befits one of the legendary titles of Hollywood<br />history, Dracula looks noticeably cleaner and brighter<br />than in its previous DVD releases, and the soundtrack<br />also seems improved.\\" Based on that I thought it would<br />be an upgrade.<br /><br />First the good news: I prefer the original audio track<br />over the Philip Glass. It was quite muffled on the<br />Legacy box & is improved on the new 75th edition.<br /><br />Now the bad news: On my system (Pioneer 578 DVD &<br />Toshiba 32\\" CRT; component video connection) the<br />picture quality was MUCH better on the Legacy box! On<br />my system, the Legacy box is sharper with more detail,<br />& most importantly much less video noise. The Pioneer<br />has a tendency to exaggerate video noise in Black &<br />White pictures with a poor s/n ratio, but this is<br />pretty extreme. As an example, the dark parts of the<br />first theater scene in chapter 7 where Lugosi is entering<br />the theater are more video noise then picture. The<br />Legacy box has a few more scratches on the film, but<br />if I had to choose it would definitely be the Legacy<br />box version.<br /><br />On the positive side, in my opinion despite it's flaws,<br />Dracula is probably the best American horror film of all<br />time. I also really enjoyed the new 95 minute documentary,<br /> \\"Universal Horror\\".
B00003Q43A|5.0|5 stars all the way.  It's silly, way too silly to be taken seriously, but that's ok.  No one is looking to change the world here.<br /><br />Well casted, well scripted, well acted, and well produced.
B000088E6D|5.0|While we've heard them time and time again - Buble takes the classic standards and adds his own twist. No, maybe there is nothing terribly new going on - but he didn't mutilate the music either.  Relaxing - Just lovely.
B000001FKY|2.0|I was so hyped to get this album when it was released.  After the double shot High & Dry and Pyromania, Def Leppard could do no wrong in my eyes.... Then they released Hysteria.  Very polished, very slick, very pop.  The metal was gone and so was I as one of their fans.

B00009P1O0|5.0|Okay, I may have found my new favorite Neil Young record, or maybe it's my second favorite to After the Gold Rush. Eh, who cares? It's excellent, and an easy 5-star. Shame on Geffen for leaving this one unreleased for so long!!<br /><br />It's hard for me to pick a favorite on this one, which is interesting because I'm certain of what the best song on every other Neil Young album I own is. The debut? The Loner. Everybody Knows This is Nowhere? Down by the River. After the Gold Rush? Southern Man. Harvest? Needle & the Damage Done. Tonight's the Night? Title song. Zuma? Cortez the Killer. Rust Never Sleeps? Powderfinger. In this case, though, I'm split between three: Walk On, See the Sky About to Rain and Vampire Blues.<br /><br />Walk On is probably the most familiar number, being included on Decade. It's a rant against the world. Neil was pissed off during the recording of the album, and here he lashes out at the tabloids, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Geffen Records, Crosby, Stills & Nash and his newfound stardom. It may seem like a three-minute pop song to those not familiar with Neil. But he likes irony, so it's far from. See the Sky About to Rain is another environmentalist tune a la After the Gold Rush. Similar to that song, you can tell two things: a disaster just happened, and another is on the way. Most would rage away on a song like this. But Neil, accompanied by just organ and pedal steel, proves he's a master of understatement, among many other things. Vampire Blues is (obviously) a blues song, with Neil's snarling chorus \\"I'm a vampire, babe\\". Lyrically, the song seems to be about high gas prices, something that's especially relevant today. The closing Ambulance Blues has the best lyrics on this album, very vague and hard to follow but well written and obviously angry, as the famed \\"Pissin' in the Wind\\" (a reference to Blowin' in the Wind, perhaps?) line proves. Though I disagree with its pro-Manson lyrics, Revolution Blues is a good rockin' tune, and if you know Finu Lanu you know he likes good rockin' tunes! For the Turnstiles is also good lyrics though I find banjos a headache. The lengthy title track is also cool - in fact the only mistake is Motion Pictures, a song that gets nowhere fast. But this one's great. It took me ages to find a copy (even while it was out on CD, mind you!), glad I finally did!know he likes good rockin' tunes!

0446310786|4.0|This is another of those books that everyone tells you how wonderful and incredible it is. I read it, and... okay. It's a book. And a not-bad one at that. But is it amazing? Is it the greatest, most thought-provoking book of all times? Is it truly just overrated?<br /><br />We have a story where it's almost as though the narrarator is not the main charactor, but rather, her father is. The story seems much more about Atticus than Scout, but that is a matter of interpertation. It's a story about racism, injustice, and thinking about all of that. Atticus is a man who goes against what the rest believes, and though he \\"fails\\", he knows that he has succeeded by making people think about the issues they are facing.<br /><br />So we've covered the topic. It's an interesting topic. And the book itself has some wonderful parts, but for the most part it drags on and on. So many people love this book and tell you how wonderful it is. I know that I was expecting something a bit more, and not this rather simple book. I found that a lot of the book was confusing and strange, and this did not make reading easier.<br /><br />While, yes, this book must have been surprising and different, it's not absolutely amazing. It's good, but perhaps a bit overrated. If you've been hearing how good it is, don't be surprised if you feel that the book is good, but not the best book of the 20th century. If you do think it's incredible, that's also understandable. Different tastes, after all. The writing style is simple, the plot drags sometimes, and parts just didn't make sense. While I'm impressed that this was written at the time it was written in, let's put things in perspective.<br /><br />I do like this book, I just think that it's not a \\"classic\\". \\"Classics\\" are books like \\"The Count of Monte Criso\\", or \\"Crime and Punishment\\". Perhaps it's a \\"modern classic\\", like Steinbeck or others. But I don't think it's a classic (as most of the tags for this book are: classics, classic literature, classic...).<br /><br />I rate this a four because I feel that it's something everyone should read (if for some odd reason you didn't read it in high school). Whether you like it like so many others, dislike it as many teenagers who are forced to read it do, or merely feel that's it's good, but overrated, like myself, it's worth reading, not just to find out where you fit, but also to try to see and understand why it is much loved. I myself have only just realized that everyone loves this for the fact that it tackled such social issues. It's worth reading, but not everyone should expect to find it a brilliant classic, but rather, just a good old book. I was a bit disappointed when I read it, so just understand that there's a possibility that you won't find it incredible.<br /><br />I urge you to read it, but just don't be disappointed because you were expecting something bigger and more like the rest of the \\"classics\\".because I feel that it's something everyone should read (if for some odd reason you didn't read it in high school).

B0000507R0|5.0|I first became aware of this album in the early '80s, and have enjoyed it from moment one.  It's really a seminal piece in the world of classic progressive rock, and should be in every prog-rock lover's collection. <br /> <br />I recently - and miraculously - came across a new copy of this DVD-Audio.  When I put it in, I was blown away.  The fidelity is beyond words; it's like a brand new album only recorded yesterday! <br /> <br />It's too bad that DVD-Audio is all but on the way out, and that this title is out of print.
B000CPGZHA|5.0|I've seen 4 Kylie Shows.  This one makes the other 3 seem like nap time.  This show is the best tour I have ever seen.  It's flashy, but in an effortless way.  Almost like this tour was more about ideas based on what Kylie wants more than what the audience would want.  She starts out with a Moulin Rouge theme that is super flashy and glamorous.  Next was the Disco Dive section.  After that she has a Homo erotic men-together-in-the-locker-room theme that is perfect for preserving her gay appeal, (not to mention that the dancers are almost naked).  She also has some Chicago influence and then comes the Space Age Kylie.  Her singing is stronger than any of the actual tracks she has recorded.  Then there is the set itself, it's amazing.  There are many beautiful colors and pieces that go every which way.  It is very nice.  I would pick up this DVD as soon as you can.
B00005JKNC|2.0|While most will argue that The Majestic was an opportunity for famed director Frank Darabont to pay homage to the infamous films of Frank Capra, this critic felt it was more an opportunity for Darabont to successfully clich&eacute; every recycled element in Hollywood cinema with the sole purpose of making us feel sympathetic to an unimaginative character.  The Majestic tried too hard to keep the audience's attention.  The Majestic tried to hard to give us a fictional town where realism was taken from the same page as Pleasantville.  The Majestic attempted to give Jim Carrey the opportunity to win an Oscar, but as we learn from Jack Nicholson, one sometimes cannot just calm the face to fully embrace a dramatic role.  My point is that The Majestic tried too hard, thus forcing the film to transform from a sentimental piece of nostalgia, to just sheer rubbish.  While Darabont tried to capture the spirit of 1950s Hollywood in this film, what in fact occurred was simple one dimensional characters that we cared nothing for, events that took place that seemed misplaced from reality, and emotions that escaped honesty forcing us to sit through two plus hours of pure, 100% uncut, Darabont drivel.<br /><br />Take a brief moment and go through the internet to watch the trailer to this film.  Just as I write this review, I find myself looking at what I thought this film was going to center around to suddenly realizing what Darabont actually gave me.  To be utterly frank, this is not a film about a theater.  Sure, one would assume from both the poster as well as the trailer that it may be about a man suffering from amnesia goes to a small town to rejuvenate an independent theater.  As a man who dreams of similar ideas (sans the amnesia), I was ready to enjoy this feature.  I was even willing to give Carrey a chance because he had proven to me over time that he could handle a meatier roll.  Alas, when the final credits finally did run for this film, I did not see The Majestic as the film that was promised to me.  I was expecting an American version of Cinema Paradiso, but instead found myself with more recycled Hollywood mumbo-jumbo that I could wave a stick at.  The story was profoundly old, with Carrey doing nothing to re-establish his character.  As I look back at his performance, he didn't grab anything by the horns, he didn't push his character to the limit, what he attempted to do was gain audience support by being less comic/zany and more \\"human\\", but for me you could see right though his performance.  In a year worth of decent performers making their mark in Hollywood, Carrey's performance of Peter Appleton was about as transparent as a ghost and will not remain relevant through the test of time.<br /><br />As I sit here and nitpick this film, I begin to realize that The Majestic was not the best that Darabont has to offer.  I would argue that The Shawshank Redemption was a pure moment of cinematic intelligence, and that perhaps when Darabont joins forces with Stephen King, the work is pure film magic, but when it comes to creating other work, it just seems to fall into the pan of lest resistance.  My major issue with this film was the surfacing of smaller issues like Carrey's nonchalant performance, the ridiculous nature of the town of Lawson (and the clich&eacute; characters that seemed to inhabit the streets), and the over-played ending speech which seemed like a cut-and-paste of nearly ever other \\"courtroom\\" drama ever produced.  It just felt uncreative from beginning to end.  There were hardly any surprises or moments that had you gripping your seat with anticipation.  Darabont played it safe, but the final result ended up being a jumbled mess of already used clich&eacute;s.  I wish I could list them all for you, but as a man who has seen his fair share of movies, I could count the beats with my eyes closed in this film.  I knew when he was going to crash, I knew there was going to be a love interest, I knew Carrey would be facedwith emotion, and I knew that eventually he would have to defend himself to everyone that we found our eyes surrounding.  I knew these events were going to happen, and I am sure that anyone that has seen more than two films in their lifetime would see the same.  Creativity, imagination, and energy are three core elements needed to make a film go from average to cult-remembering ... but The Majestic had none of these traits, so it falls into the wayside of being found in a dollar bin within the year.<br /><br />As I read my lines for this review, a name seems to resonate deeply within these words that utterly describe why this feature failed.  I use the word \\"fail\\", because it was not a memorable to any extent.  The acting was laughable and the story was as generic as Grade-A cheese, and while others may blame Carrey or the writer for such errors, this critic blames Frank Darabont.  I see that he was trying to redefine an era of cinema, but why, as a man who loves movies from the 1940s, is this film so terrible to view?  I do not believe that Darabont was able to capture the raw nature of the period.  I don't believe that Mayberry is on every corner and that every film made in the 50s represented this fake life.  He over dramatized the smaller events while completely missing his mark on the bigger moments.  This film could have benefited from a small war scene, or possibly from a visitation from Luke himself near the end.  I just needed something to spark my interest more than what was presented here.  I felt cheated from this film because it gave up midway through and did not push the limits of filmmaking.  While I don't expect that with every movie Hollywood releases, there is a level of expectation with a Darabont film which wasn't included here.  Mediocrity is what paid the Darabont bill in this feature.<br /><br />Overall, I wasn't impressed with this film in any way.  The cinematography wasn't even worth mentioning because it was so far below the level of mediocrity I found myself deeply sleeping instead of enjoying the clich&eacute; moments that Darabont had to offer.  Again, I cannot state that if you have seen two films ever in your life, you have already seen at least 8/9ths of this film.  That is about the level of creativity and excitement provided.  If you are a die-hard Carrey fan, I still don't think that you will find any excitement or enjoyment from this feature.  Carrey doesn't go crazy, but maybe he should have for the audience members that were nearly asleep.  What a poor, sad excuse for a film!<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****and I knew that eventually he would have to defend himself to everyone that we found our eyes surrounding.

This film could have benefited from a small war scene, or possibly from a visitation from Luke himself near the end.  I just needed something to spark my interest more than what was presented here.  I felt cheated from this film because it gave up midway through and did not push the limits of filmmaking.  While I don't expect that with every movie Hollywood releases, there is a level of expectation with a Darabont film which wasn't included here.  Mediocrity is what paid the Darabont bill in this feature. <br /> <br />Overall, I wasn't impressed with this film in any way.  The cinematography wasn't even worth mentioning because it was so far below the level of mediocrity I found myself deeply sleeping instead of enjoying the cliché moments that Darabont had to offer.  Again, I cannot state that if you have seen two films ever in your life, you have already seen at least 8/9ths of this film.  That is about the level of creativity and excitement provided.  If you are a die-hard Carrey fan, I still don't think that you will find any excitement or enjoyment from this feature.  Carrey doesn't go crazy, but maybe he should have for the audience members that were nearly asleep.  What a poor, sad excuse for a film! <br /> <br />Grade: ** out of *****
B00005JKJA|5.0|I think this ultimate movie is definitely for collection. Instead of renting it again and again to unlock the mysteries just buy the lock and take your time solving the puzzles and save $$$ too. It's not a \\"theater movie\\". It's a home +couch+ solitary movie.<br /><br />These clues are helpful only if you have watched the whole movie :)<br /><br />In the beginning the movie zooms into a sleeping woman which means the coming up things are dream (dream of Diane (in dream her name is Betty) which she would only \\"dream\\" in real life):<br />1. The car accident of Rita (real life Camellia; girl friend of Diane) which was almost similar to that one night in real life of Diane when Camellia broke her heart breaking up with her and announcing her marriage with a movie director. It was no less than a worse accident for Diane, which she wanted Camellia to experience. So there is Rita only survivor of a bad car wreck.<br />2. In real life Camellia is a vamp so Diane dreams Rita/ Camellia with lost memory. That makes Rita very innocent and loyal to her the opposite of real life.<br />3. In real life Camellia is helping Diane getting movie roles but in the dream Betty (real life Diane) is helping Rita.<br />4. In dream Betty is full of life and acting talent but in reality Diane is just opposite.<br />5. In reality Diane had come from Canada to her Aunt place where she is living; so she dreams about going to her aunt house where she meets Rita.<br />6. The director in the dream is the one Camellia is going to marry and once in a party Diane overheard the director saying \\"I get the pool and you get the pool man\\", which she dreams later. She dreams lot bad for the poor director.<br />7. She also dreams that there has been lots of conflict going on between director's and producer's choice to cast the lead actress. This shows the competition between Diane and Camellia in real life. Camellia is the director choice.<br />8. The hit man is the one she hired to kill Camellia.<br />9. The cowboy is still a puzzle; he appears 3 times in the movie.<br />10. Betty and Rita discovering a body (of Diane???) is also puzzle.<br />11. The restaurant scene with the scary guy is still a puzzle to me.<br />12. The Silencio club part of the movie is a hint for the viewers and gives Betty the puzzle box for which she has the key.<br /><br />When Rita unlocks the blue box, the reality starts:<br />1. Diane is in horrible condition as she missed Camellia.<br />2. She knows that Camellia has been murdered because the hit man has returned her the blue key.<br />3. She is so paranoid that she kills herself.<br /><br />So basically Diane who lost her GF (Camellia) and had her murdered is dreaming a better world till the Silencio club part of the movie. When she wakes up she realizes her mistake and kills herself.e movie.   10. Betty and Rita discovering a body (of Diane???) is also puzzle.  11.

0807014265|5.0|This is an easy to read book, which managed to make profound points about life, pain, and fate.  I enjoyed reading the first part of the book and learning about what it was like to be in such a hellish place (a concentration camp), and yet still being able to be positive about life.  What more can I say than its an excellent book?
B000BW7QWW|5.0|`Serenity' is the coolest sci-fi movie in years, it always being in the top DVDs here proves that in itself. If you love the TV series `Firefly', but haven't seen this movie, you are really missing something. The story is truly and simply amazing. The characters are back with just as much attitude as they had from the series.<br /><br />The special effects and look of this movie are grade A and look fantastic. There are many scenes that are really just breathtaking. The movie also has a lot of action, but it also has a very deep storyline that keeps it from ever being dull. There are both surprises and revelations in this movie that will keep you talking for long time. This movie isn't something you will forget any time soon. I definitely recommend this movie, even to those who have never seen the TV series. It will make you a fan for sure. And if you are already a brown coat (Firefly fan), you will become even more of one. I just hope we see another movie in the future!!
B000021Y77|4.0|For me, this movie got off on the wrong foot when it posed a question and left us hanging for the answer.  It basically asked us what the one question in life is, and what that answer is, then suggested that both the question and answer were obvious, and left it there without providing its answers.  I could have done without that bit of annoying stupidity.<br /><br />The annoyance factor from that nonsense was strong enough to detract from my enjoyment of the next few minutes of colorful cartoons.<br /><br />To my surprise, the movie got better.  After a dismal beginning it became absorbing.<br /><br />The main characters are Lola (young German girl with vivid red hair), her worthless, immature and moronic boyfriend Manni (who you hope will die), and her rich and philandering father.  You kind of root for Lola to achieve her goal of saving her boyfriend from execution, but then again, you'd kind of like to kill her boyfriend yourself.<br /><br />Manni was entrusted with a wonderful opportunity in life, the opportunity to complete a drug deal and give the proceeds to the boss.  This will help him climb the ladder of success in crime.  What an enterprising young man.  He does complete the deal, but then he stupidly leaves the fortune on a train because he sees some cops entering the train and he stupidly just gets up from his seat, without the money bag, and leaves.  Dumb bunny.<br /><br />He then telephones Lola and whines and panics to her.  She swears she will help him.  His solution is to rob a supermarket and get the money that way, to avoid being executed for not producing the drug money.  He gives her a narrow time frame to show up and help him, because he is on a narrow time schedule himself, due to meet up with the drug boss.<br /><br />That is the background of the film.  Lola wants to get the money from her father, but that doesn't work.  Her attempts to help the witless and extremely annoying Manni do not succeed, and we have a sad ending for our two heroes.<br /><br />Next thing you know, the happy couple is in bed together, and alive.  None of this happened.  Was it all a dream?  Lola is asking questions about Manni's love for her.  They are idiotic questions, but he is patient with them.<br /><br />Presto.  The scene starts to play out again.  Lola has another chance to help her idiot boyfriend out of the same jam.  This time she does it a little differently and the outcome is also different, but still not very satisfying if you are actually rooting for Manni, which I was not.<br /><br />Once again, the happy couple are alive and well, despite the ending to episode two, and they are in bed having another philosophical discussion.  This time it is Manni with the questions.  Guess what.  The scene is redone for us.  Take three.  Can Lola make things work this time?<br /><br />Other reviews on this site say that we are shown \\"cause and effect\\" based on different strategies and decisions that Lola makes.  No we're not.  We're just shown different stories.  It's a little like the tv series Quantum Leap, if you remember that one.  There was more cause and effect in Quantum Leap than there is here.  In Run Lola Run, freak accident or dumb luck determine the outcome as much as any cause and effect.<br /><br />The fact that the third outcome is happier for the dubious couple than the first two outcomes seems to be telling us that Lola finally got it right, but if you use even half your brain you will realize that some very improbable things were happening all along and this is just a fantasy with no moral, no cause and effect, just an interesting story.<br /><br />So, what is that one question that everything boils down to, and what is its answer?  The question seems to be, umm, that life gives you the opportunity to interact with your environment, and it's up to you how it all comes out.  Maybe not.  I don't know what the hell the question and answer are, that are supposed to be so obvious that they don't even have to betold to us.<br /><br />In the end, the script writer needs to get hit over the head with a frying pan for that idiocy at the beginning, and Manni needs to be whipped with a wet noodle to knock some sense into him.  I'm sure that torturing him appropriately would help his maturity and character development.<br /><br />This is the only movie I can think of where the idealized happy ending would include the successful completion of an illegal drug deal, followed by a warm pat on the back given by the drug dealer to his brain dead protege.<br /><br />Lola is actually playing Manni's mommy.  Manni is a crying, whining, stupid baby getting himself into a jam and then putting it all on mommy to fix, and demanding that she fix it within a specified very limited time frame, and she has to run to do so, to save her idiot baby, and he petulantly blames her if she doesn't perform the miracle, or at least show up, in the allotted time.  Being stupid and amoral, Manni is a waste of skin and bone.  But mommy helps him and loves him anyway.  That's what mommies are for.<br /><br />Oh, and if there is a cause and effect to this movie, the moral would be that you need to ask a higher power for help, and you need to not rob supermarkets. Gamble instead.  Get lucky instead, one way or another.  The moral is - get lucky!  Don't you know that if you just ask the heavens for help you will win the lottery?  But if you try to rob a supermarket you will not be happy.  Thank you for that wonderful bit of philosophy.  Very deep.  At least an inch and a quarter deep.y don't even have to be told to us. <br /> <br />In the end, the script writer needs to get hit over the head with a frying pan for that idiocy at the beginning, and Manni needs to be whipped with a wet noodle to knock some sense into him.

0307341542|5.0|When we heard that Gillian Flynn, the preeminent TV critic in the English language, and the mainstay of ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY, was writing a novel, we were terribly excited.  When was the last time such a brilliant cultural critic had written a novel?  The excitement was something close to the buzz years back when Dame Rumour had Pauline Kael writing a novel!  (Alas, if Kael actually wrote one, it has never appeared.)  You'd have to go back further for a parallel, back to the days when Renata Adler or Susan Sontag could write cutting edge criticism with one hand and turn out blissful souffles of fiction with the other.  One Flynn fan advanced the case of James Agee, widely known as the top US film critic in the 1940s, who gave us the ineffable A DEATH IN THE FAMILY.  And now our own Gillian Flynn has produced a DEATH IN THE FAMILY for the 21st century, a hardboiled saga of a family in trouble big time!<br /><br />Led by Camille Preaker, an investigation into the deaths of two little Missouri girls churns up buried secrets from Camille's past.  Not only is she right out of the psych ward, but her body is carved up into words, for Camille is secretly a \\"cutter.\\"  A beautiful, sexually driven woman, Camille never met a knife she didn't like, and her body tells the tale.  In times of stress the different words on her body speak to her in special ways.<br /><br />Her stepfather, Alan, is a laissez-faire type of chap, an ineffectual, football playing plutocrat with no visible interest.  His wife, Adora, is always perfect and wears her hair in the Norwegian style of Liv Ullmann.  Her house is always perfect, as is the four foot high replica dollhouse she has given her youngest daughter, Amma.<br /><br />Amma is \\"barely thirteen\\" but already knows all about drugs, heavy drinking, sexual activity, bullying, meanness, snobbery, deceit, and most of all, how to get your own way and how to focus attention on oneself.  What she can barely remember is that 13 years ago, little Marian, her sister, died a tragic death in the hospital, too weak to continue living.  Ever since that day, the family has been in remission.<br /><br />The tiny rown in Missouri where they reign is dominated by a pig factory in which animals are cruelly slaughtered, under the fascinated gaze of little Amma, who exhibits a cruel streak sometimes.  She loves to watch the sows diem giggling while \\"the sow's eyes rolled up into her head.\\"  but big sister Camille is apt to cut her slack, since it is dull for a young, bright girl in a Southern hamlet like Wind Gap.<br /><br />Camille finds herself torn between two men--cute boytoy John, who's sort of like \\"John\\" on DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES--a little young, but too beautiful for Camille to resist--and a \\"cute cop\\" called Richard, a Kansas City profile trying to help the hicks solve the two-girl murder.  All of the teeth have been mysteriously plucked from the girls' mouths after death.<br /><br />There's a mystery surrounding the man who was Camille's father.  With that and the teeth thing, you won't find a wink of sleep for however long it takes you to finish SHARP OBJECTS.<br /><br />Thoroughly hard-edged, not to say repellent, SHARP OBJECTS is the kind of book Susan Sontag went to her grave wishing she could have written.  It may not be as good as Agee's A DEATH IN THE FAMILY, but it's miles better than Renata Adler's SPEEDBOAT.  People say that Gillian Flynn's real mother is nice as pie.  Too bad for her, because nobody who reads SHARP OBJECTS will ever entirely believe that.  It's too real!e Marian, her sister, died a tragic death in the hospital, too weak to continue living.

B000HWZ4A2|5.0|Comparisons to Ayn Rand's novel can be made but the cinema and the written word are two different mediums. The gist of the story is intact in this film. The film's strength lies with Gary Cooper's performance as architect Howard Roark and the dialogue of his interaction with the film's other characters. Cooper's delivery at his trial is a screen classic. Patricia Neal and Kent Smith give very good performances. Max Steiner's score is one of his best.
0345440757|5.0|I can't recommend this book enough. When people say babies don't come with owner's manuals, I say they haven't read The Baby Whisperer. Friends and family were shocked, SHOCKED that both of my kids slept through the night at 8 weeks, fell asleep on their own, and napped beautifully. I was able to interpret their cries and movements so I could anticipate their needs. I   and my babies were happy and content.  <br /> <br />The key to it all is the EASY plan. Eat, activity, sleep, which means time for you. Babies crave routine so they know what to expect and this book offers that. Yet, Tracy does not recommend clock watching.  It's flexible.  <br /> <br />If you are pregnant or have a newborn, I highly recommend this book. I followed it and was so pleased.
0743298020|5.0|I just finished The Thirteenth Tale and it's a good thing I did.  I couldn't do anything else until the story ended!  This novel is a murder mystery, a gothic thriller, and a right good ghost story all rolled into one.  It's a dual story about a famous, though elusive, writer of popular fiction (Vida Winter) and a reclusive keeper of antiquated books (Margaret Lea).  The two come together to reveal the truth about both of their lives and put to rest the ghosts they both keep in their closets.<br /><br />During the first couple of chapters, I thought it might be yet another story about introverted, fatalistic and self-absorbed women (ho hum and yuck), but as soon as Vida Winter began the final tale of her life, I was hooked.  The ins and outs of the story are complicated and include scandal, insanity, obsession, love, hate, murder, lies, truth, dark characters, dark secrets, tragedy, triumph,...  Honestly, what more could a reader ask for?  There were a few moments of confusion about which character was telling which story, but if you will continue reading all of the questions are answered in due time.<br /><br />I appreciated the fact that the author didn't feel compelled to spell it all out and talk down to the reader.  I like being left to decide for myself about some things and I especially like an author who doesn't tie up all of the loose ends, but leaves it to the reader to make some assumptions on his own.  I was surprised when I read that this is Miss Setterfield's first book.  I will anxiously look forward to her next offering.

B000HCO8IQ|5.0|I first heard the Scissor Sisters' music when a friend of mine played me a couple videos of theirs.  At first, I thought it was Fleetwood Mac (please note, I was listening and not paying any attention to the actual video).  When I heard it was a relatively new band, one with such a distinctively retro sound, I immediately became interested.<br /><br />I wasn't the least bit disappointed.  TA DAH! is one of the best records I've heard in a long, long time.  It is pop; it is rock; it's retro, jazz, funk, techno, electronica, ragtime, even a tad bit country (there are some country licks in \\"I Can't Decide,\\" and I dare anyone to say otherwise).  The Scissor Sisters have brilliantly combined so many different styles of music into one flawless, funk-filled sound.  With catchy, sometimes brutally-honest lyrics, and melodies you can't help but enjoy, TA DAH! is a purely brilliant record (the fact that Sir Elton John sits in on a couple pieces he co-wrote doesn't hurt matters either).  I defy any music lover to pass up this wonderful opportunity to hear so many sounds merged into one; TA DAH! is truly a great listening experience.  And, if nothing else, it's simply fun!
1400032717|4.0|Having never read or heard of Mark Haddon, I picked up his book \\"The Curious Incident\\" solely because I had previously worked with a young man diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome. I was curious to read how one would depict the world as seen by a person with the disorder, as I constantly felt both alienated and inadequately prepared to deal with a child whose view was so different from my own. <br />Haddon's character Christopher instantly grabbed me with his quick, simple narrative style, and repeatedly crushed me through his inability feel some of the emotions that most of us consider vital to our identity as people. Haddon's ability to detach himself from real-world relationships and examine them from such a unique point of view is extraordinary and he thus imparts on Christopher a tragic quality that will deeply move you, whether or not you have known an Asperger's child. <br />If the book taught me anything, it was to appreciate these strange, everyday occurrences that we call relationships. Our ability to feel love, anger and despair and, more importantly, our ability to recognize and empathize with those feelings in others, is truly a blessing and one that, as Christopher demonstrates, we should not take for granted. <br />
B000002TQV|5.0|I remember going to a R.E.M. concert in Phoenix AZ circa 1994, waiting for ticket prices to go down just before the show while the warm up group played.  That group had had one hit, Creep, but despite glowing reviews of their new album, I couldn't be bothered.  A few weeks later Fake Plastic Trees arrived to me via a promo CD.  I thought it was fantastic and decided to buy The Bends and check out the hype. <br /> <br />Suffice to say those few bucks I saved before the concert were not well worth it.  The Bends turned out to be one of my all time favorites (OK Computer is good, but in my books nothing compared to The Bends, which has a more White Beatles Album feel as opposed to the Pink Floyd feel of Computer).  Planet Telex was an immediate sign of the album's greatness.  High & Dry actually became a minor hit in the States but is one of my least favorites.  The range of songs, both texts and performance, is from rage to pure beauty, adding up to a set of pop melodies without a dull moment. <br /> <br />This album has aged remarkably well and although I haven't been a fan of their recent work, I still would like to see Radiohead perform live to partially rectify my mistake years ago.  <br />
B00005N6KG|5.0|I had a pair of this style headphone that came with my cassette-Walkman back in 1990. They lasted until a few years ago when the plastic that held them on to the [then] metal headband broke during a move. I had really enjoyed them and they were my only headphones for the 12 or so years.     I held off replacing them since I was just getting married and my fiance had a ton of various headphones from Rio's and portable CD players and such, all of which (headphones) were more modern looking, around the ear, rather than over the head types. Well, after a few years I'm fed up with all those junk headphones. The Rio headphones are garbage, another pair of Jensens with the wrap-around ear style were equally crappy. A pair of Sony's that had a clip to attach around the ear sounded good, but they were the type that sat over top of the ear and they just sat there too loose and therefore lost any bass response unless I pushed them up against my ears with my hands. Then I got a set with a Creative Muvo most recently. They were the in-ear bud type. I've always hated these as they always slip out of my ear or cause discomfort after just a few minutes. They didn't really sound all that good anyway.    The only pair I would use was a pair of Sony's that came with an MP3/CD player from a few years back. They sounded pretty good but they were for a private setting only because they looked stupid, like ear muffs. So I finally sprung for these.    I am very satisfied as these sound great. There's not as much bass as you might get from bigger, over the ear types, like a pair of wireless headphones I have at work, but these sound great and look great. They fit better than the previous model from 1990 I spoke of too. I use these mainly for travel and exercising and I'm confident they'll meet my needs for years to come, and if they break by some carelessness on my part, they aren't expensive to replace.    Update 12/14/06:  Just got an ipod shuffle gen. 2. These headphones are still far better acoustically than the  ones that came with the ipod. The downside is that they aren't nearly as compact, especially since the ipod itself it super-tiny. I don't know what kind of ears people need to have for those ear-bud type, but they just don't stay in.
B00000K19E|4.0|Well, I guess it is old now but I am always surprised how much I like this movie the more times I watch it.  First time I concentrated on the hand to hand combat too much but if you can get past these guys playing patticakes with eachother, this is a great movie.  The scene where Keanu and Fishburne spar is still hilarious and the set looks like it came straight form 'Fist of Legend' but it is still fun.  I lked his training sequences overall.  The whole computer world never really appealed to me but it's a ton of fun trying to figure things out.  The shootouts are great and all of the acting is top notch.  Even Keano Reeves is pretty likeable.<br /><br />There are 2 commentaries but the making of was a look into something that is as interesting as it gets.  Getting a glimpse of Woo Ping set up his action is great and even better trying to figure out what goes on in this guys mind.  I hope we get a new special edition one day with a long piece on him.
B000GRUS22|5.0|Like some other reviewers, the more I listen to this CD the more I like it. I found it to be a good CD to listen to for relaxation and exercising the imagination. Few tracks are memorable, but I felt it was all worth it for Goodbye Milky Way and Sitting on the Moon. I really like how Enigma creates a different sound and mood for each of their albums. I know of some music artists who never do that, and each album they come out with is predictable and the same. With Enigma, I always look forward to their releases because I know they'll have some new surprises.

0743298020|5.0|Margaret Lea, the narrator of The Thirteenth Tale is a solitary, intelligent woman, with a true passion for the written word.  However, true to the gothic styling of the story, she has her own compelling secrets to discover.  She is commissioned to compose the dying Vida Winter's (the world's best selling and most peculiar{?} author) biography...or has she? <br /> <br />It is the telling of Vida's tale that literally sweeps the reader into the book's passages, the joys of storytelling, the purity of weaving trails that lead to wondrous, disturbing paths. <br /> <br />Setterfield's characters are from another era, yet so completely belong not only to each other, Setterfield eagerly and vividly allows them to be embraced by us, her readers, so fulfilling, so rounded, so lovingly odd in the most flawed way that truly, at some level you can't help but escape into this world.  It is truly a world of books, twins, dark houses, snowy nights, strange persons, and odd backgrounds, really all terribly...yummy! <br /> <br />A world that curls and spirals its way with extraordinary texture to an neat albiet somewhat confusing ending, a conclusion unforseen, perhaps even somewhat...grasping?  Still it doesn't hinder the dazzling worth of one of the best books of the year!
B00003CXMG|5.0|`Almost Famous' is one of those films I had been dying to see and just never got around to.  Then the other night it was on Bravo and I figured I had time, I might as well watch it.  Let me say that I'm glad I can finally say I've seen it, and what a wonderful experience it was.  Despite my feelings about the lack of talent young Patrick Fugit has, he's quickly offset by the other talent on the screen.  Kate Hudson delivers the best performance here with her Penny Lane, groupie extraordinaire who follows her favorite band `Stillwater', the same band that William (Fugit) is traveling with in order to write an article for a rock magazine.  Penny is such a free spirit, and she's so devoted to the music she loves that you're instantly drawn to her.  Billy Crudup also does well as the bands lead singer and Penny's crush, and Jason Lee is hilarious as the lead guitarist.  As I'm sure all have read that this is a fictional tale based on Cameron Crowe's younger years as a reporter for Creem and Rolling Stone and so as the director Crowe makes sure that the film has those personal touches that lift it from sheer entertainment and create a realistic and homey feel throughout the film.  I loved it, and I'm sure that everyone else will too.  The film is just so happy and free you can't help but enjoy every minute of it.

If you read the chapter dedicated to Nero, you'll be even more shocked because Nero was always fascinated by his uncle Caligula (he was a son of Caligula's sister Agrippina who later became a wife of Claudius who adopted Nero and made him the heir for the title and the power of Roman Emperor). Anyway, Nero made Caligula his role model and managed to surpass his uncle's' notorious fame.<br /><br />The movie is ifamous for the plentiful scenes of real sex, including incest, necrophilia, rape, and orgies. The movie also includes quite nasty and gruesome scenes of torture, executions, murders, and humiliations but all of the events have been recorded in the historical documents that still exist.<br /><br />I don't think of the movie as a masterpiece or even a good movie for all of its 2.5 hours. It actually reminds the life of real Caligula. In his childhood and youth, he was adored by Roman people and especially by the army and he was a promising young man. When he grew up as a heir to the cruel and suspicious Tiberius, he had to hide his feelings and go through many humiliations in order to survive. Shrewd Tiberius said about his adopted grandson that \\"never humankind knew the better slave and the worse ruler than Caligula\\" and that he was rearing \\"a viper for the Roman people and a Phaethon for the world.\\"<br /><br />When the young man finally received an access to the absolute power it had absolutely corrupted him. It is also known that soon after becoming head of Roman Empire, Caligula suffered an illness and as the result of it, he became incredibly nasty, cruel, and suspicious man who had indulged in the worst acts of debauchery, cruelty, and sadism. The movie follows this pattern. I still think that it is an interesting movie with very good actors. Not every day you can see porn with Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole, Sir John Gielgud, and of course, Mr. Clockwork Orange himself, Malcolm McDowell.t is an interesting movie with very good actors.

B0001XAPX8|2.0|I sat through this entire film even after my wife begged me to turn it off and then stormed out of the room to watch TV in the living room.  She was bored to tears and felt that the premise was unbelievably stupid.  Little did she know, I completely agreed I just have this thing about only seeing part of a movie.  I had to finish it, even if I knew I was gonna hate it.  To me the idea that Anthony Hopkins could be a black man is so unbelievable that I couldn't even begin to concentrate on the meat of the film.  I understand that the novel is acclaimed and everything, and everyone, even critics feel that this film is loyal to that novel, but if that's the case then the novel can't be that great.  If they had chosen another actor I could have believed it maybe, I mean, I have light skinned black friends and I know they could pass for white, but when they tell you their black you can see the features...Anthony Hopkins is whiter than I am...and there's no way I could pass for black so Hopkins is out.  Really if it weren't for the excellent acting on the parts of Hopkins, Kidman and Harris this movie would have no redeeming qualities.  So here you have it, young black man looks white, realizes it's easier to just play white then be who you are, he disowns his family to live his life easy, he becomes a teacher and now in his 70's he's accused of being racist by the people who think he's white so he starts an affair with a much younger woman whos drunk husband wants to kill them both, and he does, and then his secret is exposed to this guy who wants to write a book about him.  I just had such a hard time getting over the idea that some idiot thought Anthony Hopkins could be black that I can't even see this movie for the good that it is.  I'm sorry; this review is probably so tainted it's not even funny.  For all I know this is a great movie, I mean even the premise is something I would normally really enjoy it's just so hard to get over...I'm rambling...never mind.  Like Isaid, I really tried.
0143036556|4.0|Jared Diamond is a highly respected scholar who, like Bernard Lewis and Karen Armstrong, is able to write serious books that convey a wealth of knowledge but are also a pleasure to read. This is in contrast to the many dry, dull tomes written by some others in academia. In this aspect, \\"Collapse\\" is a success. But, unfortunately, it just doesn't rise to the extremely high standard set by his previous title, \\"Guns, Germs And Steel,\\" one of my favorite non-fiction books.     I most enjoyed the middle chapters which discuss how environmental problems can lead to societal breakdowns, as was the case with the collapse of the Mayan Empire and the extreme violence committed by Hutus against Tutsis in Rwanda. I also think Diamond does a capable job of explaining many of the major environmental problems, such as deforestation, global warming and human overpopulation, facing us in the 21st century. However, Diamond comes across as too much of a politician, rather than a scientist, in his writings on environmental issues. For example, he seems to be trying to please everybody and offend no one when discussing the negative environmental effects caused by the poor practices of certain logging and mining companies. Obviously, economic needs and environmental concerns must learn to co-exist. And, of course, good \\"corporate citizenship\\" should be applauded when it occurs. But, since Diamond is a dedicated environmentalist who understands the science behind the \\"web of life\\" and the importance of preserving it, he should have been less timid and mealy mouthed in his explanations. He also failed to emphasis the fact that other species have an intrinsic right to exist as part of this \\"web of life\\" of which we humans are only a part of rather than separate from. In other words, preserving the wholeness and integrity of the bio-sphere is more important than short term human convenience. \\"Deep ecology\\" is an essential concept to understand when discussing the environment. Jared certainlyunderstands this but prefers to stay in shallow waters, apparently because he doesn't want to upset his anti-environmentalist critics. I would hope for more courage on his part.    \\"Collapse\\" is still a book worth reading. But it seems a little weak willed and not close to the level of his outstanding \\"Guns, Germs And Steel.\\"
B000001E29|5.0|First off, to the best of my knowledge there is no commerically released cast recording of The Black Rider. The music on this album is arranged differently than that from the stage show, and all the main vocals are by Tom Waits. <br /> <br />That being said, this is easily Tom Waits's most underappreciated album. On a first listen, it can be intimidating; even die-hard fans of Real Gone may have trouble getting through tracks like \\"Oily Night\\". The lyrics are, let's face it, terrifying, and if you're not expecting it, it's rather jarring. <br /> <br />The thing about the album is that once you hear it, you just have to hear it again. It crawls into your head and just won't get out. It's easy to see why The Black Rider has a cult following. It's seductive and entrancing, and it just won't let you go.
0618680004|5.0|There is a challenge in reviewing a book of this sort - being \\"objective\\".  Customers want reviewers to stand aside from prejudices when they assess an item's value as a purchase.  It's a stance nearly impossible with this book - few people are indifferent to their perceived gods.<br /><br />That is the point of this effort - most people are \\"religious\\", some violently so in its name.  Why should either circumstance hold among Homo sapiens - \\"wise man\\"?  \\"Wise\\" men figure prominently in this book, even when their wisdom - whether through ignorance or manipulation - is misunderstood by others.  Einstein's words about \\"playing dice\\" are trotted out and examined.  The famous \\"Pascal's Wager\\" about the usefulness of \\"denying God\\" is scrutinised [was Pascal making a joke?].  Scientists of many stripes, particularly three in Dawkins' own Britain, are cited with their logic, if any, carefully dissected.  Religion and the idea of a god permeate our society and Dawkins wants to examine the real roots of that phenomenon.  In this stimulating study, which will fail to reach those who need it most, the author of \\"The Blind Watchmaker\\" and other fine works spells out why the notion of \\"God\\" is untenable.  He accepts the capitalised version because it's the one his readership accepts.<br /><br />After explaining why the many and various arguments supporting the idea of \\"God\\" are based on false or illogical premises - the author must explain why the notion persists.  One reason, he insists, is the \\"hands-off\\" approach to the subject that has been so widely accepted.  \\"It's bad form to question religion\\".  Dawkins dismisses such timidity as unworthy of the scientific enterprise.  If we can investigate an unseen force that can be measured, such as gravity, why must we pass over one that cannot manifest itself?  If this god is \\"everywhere\\", why weren't the Ten Commandments engraved on the Moon?  There must be another answer, and Dawkins, as an evolutionary biologist, supplies one.  However, readers are here cautioned by Dawkins that an understanding of natural selection is the prerequisite.<br /><br />Having already disposed of the \\"traditional\\" [in the Western world, at least] arguments such as \\"it's just there\\" or the \\"argument from design\\", about the existence of a deity, Dawkins provides a two-pronged evolutionary basis.  The first, and most compelling, is the training of children.  \\"Honour thy parents\\" makes no distinction about whether parental advice and direction is valid.  Our primate heritage ties the young to their parents longer than other species.  There's a vast span of time to provide both valuable and worthless material for their retention.  What is retained, is due to the second of his two reasons, the \\"meme\\".  The meme, units of information retained by the mind and passed on have featured largely in Dawkins' views on religion.  Cognitive studies have shown that information planted early tends to remain in place and guide later behaviour.  Religion is far more often \\"passed down\\" than it is \\"picked up\\" in later life.<br /><br />The \\"faithful\\" are often quick to point out that in religion rests \\"morality\\", \\"comfort\\" and the roots of what we consider \\"beauty\\".  Dawkins skilfully demolishes each of these contentions.  \\"Morality\\", already a vague term, is hardly exemplified by what religion sources provide.  Intemperate and massive slaughters, hypocrisies at wholesale rates and misogynist examples that make the reader shudder with disgust.  \\"Beauty\\" is a topic at which Dawkins shines best.  Long an advocate of the beauties in Nature science has revealed, he extols the wonders science has demonstrated to us.  We often have difficulty dealing with those fascinating, if normally hidden, aspects of nature because we didn't evolve to perceive them.  We live in a narrow zone of perception, which Dawkins calls the \\"Middle World\\".  We see only a small set of light frequencies.  We hear in a limited range of sounds.  We can't detect \\"colours\\" by smell or see the magnetic fields used by porpoises.<br /><br />To those who already accept the idea that lack of evidence for any deity renders the concept implausible at best [such as this reviewer], there won't be much new in this book.  People consider it sufficient to \\"declare\\" there are gods without feeling the need to \\"demonstrate\\" them.  All of the phenomena attributed to a god have been examined and shown to have natural causes.  Even the beginnings of life are well enough understood to forecast confidently that \\"life\\" will emerge from some laboratory, as Dawkins points out cogently.  The zoologist is even able to handle questions of cosmology with better than layman's skills, as he outlines the various concepts currently under investigation.  None of these theories needs a deity to either start the universe or regulate it.  This is a formidable examination, redundant aspects or not, deserving the widest possible audience.

0307346609|5.0|Max Brooks' shamblingly good World War Z made this zombie-genre-fan want more, more, more. This \\"oral history\\" chronicles the stories of many who fought in and survived the zombie wars. If any one of their stories were expanded into a full-length novel, I would snap it up. I'm sure he's already been asked, but I must add my voice to the clamor: Please, Max Brooks, if you  have a third zombie book in you, write one that follows a protagonist from start to finish so we can go even further into the scary, creepy, wonderful world you've created.<br /><br />For those of you who haven't read World War Z, if you're a fan of works on the undead, you must add this book to your library. One of the things that makes it so eminently readable is that Brooks manages to make the war seem factually credible, and he uses momentum and deft characterization to carry the reader along at a smoking-fast clip. I couldn't put this book down until I was done reading it, and like a zombie who can't get enough human flesh, I wanted more of Brooks' storytelling.<br /><br />It's a rare treat to find a well-written story about the walking dead, and this book fills the bill in a most delicious way.

My favorites, among York (Gary Cooper) are Pastor Pile (Walter Brennan), York's mom (Margaret Wycherly), and 'Pusher' Ross(George Tobias).

B000275R6S|4.0|I have owned this watch for almost 2 years and it has far out-lasted other 'budget' watches I have owned.  It keeps good time and the glass has resisted scratches and breakage.  The strap ('bracelet') is the literal and figurative weak-link though; the links stretch and I have repeatedly had to repair it.  Great value for the money overall.
B000023VR6|4.0|Standout tracks: THE WATCHER, F**K YOU, STILL DRE, BIG EGO'S XXXPLOSIVE, WHATS THE DIFFERENCE, FORGOT ABOUT DRE, THE NEXT EPISODE, ED-UCATION(Eddie Griffin is a damn fool LOL!), SOME LA N***AZ, HOUSEWIFE and THE MESSAGE(tight tribute to his brother). Filler: Lets get high(wack plus Ms Roq cant rap for s**t), Ackrite(Hittman is Bizarre Jr!)and Bang Bang(never felt it). Bottom line: Dre sophomore album is the highlight album of 1999 but it is not better than The Chronic by a longshot. The Chronic was a milestone album that has yet to be topped plus none of his guest features busted sloppy rhymes but on this on Hittman and Ms Roq bring this album down a star. Hittman's style is buttcrack and Ms Roq is too wack to be a female clone of anybody. This album would be even better than it is now without Hittman on every other track. Dr. Dre is a genius and im sure he can pull it off again but he needs to keep the wack guests off his next one. The production is superb and the other guest appearances do this album some justice.
0743298020|5.0|Ms. Setterfield has written a book lover's book, with a wave of her pen acknowledging Rebecca, Jane Eyre, Scheherazade and countless Gothic heroines. This book has it all: strange family members, incest, rape,sadism, murder, madness, secrets and lost children. Quickly, the plot. A biographer is hired by a well known, much loved author to tell the truth about her life. The author, Vida Winters, has outwitted one interviewer after another by sharing marvelously inventive and utterly untrue  stories about her background.  Now dying, she feels compelled to tell the truth. Margaret, a bookish young woman and reluctant biographer, has secrets of her own.   <br />Together, these two weave a compelling story that goes first one way and then another. The answers are all there but not spoon fed.  My home is in shambles, dinner was perfunctory, but I read the book in one night. <br />I had no choice.
0596101996|5.0|I'm a technical trainer, and we've decided to distribute this book as part of our Ajax courseware.  We've reviewed many other JavaScript books, but we keep coming back to this one. <br /> <br />Suffice to say - its an excellent Core javaScript coursebook by itself (the first 220 pages).  But the latest 5th edition is also a great resource for other Web 2.0 relevant topics:  Ajax/Remote Scripting, CSS, Event handling, DOM scripting, ...  The fifth edition also includes comments related to the just-release Internet Explorer 7. <br /> <br />Add in another 100+ page Core JavaScript reference section <br /> <br />Plus another 240+ page Client-Side JavaScript Object reference section (classes, methods, properties, and event handlers...such as XMLHttpRequest, Document, Window, Event) <br /> <br />And it all adds up to one thick/heavy book that deserves to be on your bookshelf... <br /> <br />My only complaint - the reference section has changed. Previous editions would tell you specifically which browser versions are applicable.  In this edition, the author chose to tell us what standard provides the specification.  Ex:  \\"ECMAScript v1\\".  IMHO - I wish the reference section consistently showed both bits of information ALL the time:  the specification standard, and the browsers which support it.

B00004LN16|4.0|Stiff Upper Lip is a good AC/DC album, it's not a great AC/DC album. <br /> <br />It kills me when people say that AC/DC have sounded the same since 1973 on every album they have done.  Nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br />I have always thought that each AC/DC album has a sound and a feel and a story in it's own and that a track off each album would be totally out of place on another album.  For instance, can you image Shake a Leg on Stiff Upper Lip?  Or Ballbreaker on Back in Black? <br /> <br />It doesn't work.  Stiff Upper Lip has its own kind of rough, bluesy feel to it.  Brian's voice sounds different, the tones and the guitars sound different.  It's good but not great.  The standouts... <br /> <br />1. Stiff Upper Lip- Pretty rocking song.  Has a good attitude.  It's fun. <br /> <br />2. Hold Me Back and Can't Stand Still.  Very odd rolling songs.  They sound a lot alike.  Again, these songs could NEVER have been on Back in Black.  I have heard that Brian sang Can't Stand Still in one take, that's why they all clap at the end.  I don't know if that's true, but it's an interesting song. <br /> <br />3. Satellite Blues- This one is an instant classic.  I LOVE this song.  This song could have been done back in the days of Back in Black and if it were on that album I think it would be as popular as You Shook Me All Night Long. <br /> <br />Everything else is ho hum.  Not good, not bad.  Better than most bands out there.  I am really hoping AC/DC put out a killer album with their new release, whenever that is.  I hope they don't turn into the new G&R and suffer from the Chinese Democracy syndrome.
0780626966|5.0|I haven't got this box set yet but will have it soon. So my review is based on Nightmare On Elm Street part 1.  <br />The movie is what you get when superb acting, great special effects, an awesome director and a chilling story meet. The result is an amazing movie. I can't get enough of it. Only seen parts 1 and 2 so far and part 2 isn't really part of the series so I'm not reviewing it. Part 2 is not a bad movie if you disconnect yourself from the rules of what Freddy movies should be. But this review is not for part 2 so back to part 1.  <br />Everything about the film is amazing, the lighting, the acting, the music, the direction, the story, the pace, everything. I think there are not that many perfect movies, especially when it comes to horror, and this one is perfect. <br />I can probably name a dozen perfect movies, but not in the horror genre, and that is what makes me like this movie more than any other. Because I always liked the idea of horror movies, but they never lived up to my expectations. But with this series it's as if it were made for me, well and everyone else who loves horror flicks. But my point is that most horror films are in a real world, and Nightmare On Elm Street films are in a dream world, or should I say nightmare.  <br />The other thing I can't get over about this movie is the soundtrack, it's awesome and has an absolutely horrifying theme song. I've never heard a more frightening theme song. The other songs are also great, like when Nancy is attacked by Freddy in her bath tub, now that's amazing. That is my favourite scene in the movie, has such a panicy feel that will leave you absolutely blown away. I love it.  <br />The cast is very likable and believable (very important in making a good movie). <br />Well, my other favourite movies are Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure (not Bogus Journey), The Terminator, Cyborg, Bloodsport, The Running Man, The Predator, Commando, Red Sonja, T2 (never T3), Unstoppable (Wesly Snipes), New Jack City, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, The Golden Child, Big Trouble In little China, Showdown In Little Tokyo, Cyborg Cop, and all of Bruce Lee's films (not so much Green Hornet), and there's probably more but just can't think of em right now. Oh yeah, Princess Bride aswell.
B00005Q2RZ|5.0|If you haven't purchased \\"Gold\\" yet and you love Ryan Adams, or maybe are just starting to get into him, I would suggest shelling out the few extra bucks for the gold in the bonus CD.  \\"The Fools We are as Men\\" is probably one of my top 5 RA faves, and \\"Rosalie\\" is awesome too.  Of course, it goes without saying that \\"Gold\\" itself is a classic.  Don't think, just buy.
B0009VRHLK|1.0|Vincent Gallo, indulging himself in more ways than one. A road film which feels pieced-together as it goes, a bit like THE RAIN PEOPLE, but without any of that film's minor-key beauty and mystery. If you've seen BUFFALO 66, you'll wonder what happened to Gallo's brilliant scene-making, his exquisite stylistic touches, his perfect-pitch dialogue and the oddball beauty of the characters' interactions. BROWN BUNNY, in contrast, feels like an exercise that fell flat. It might have made a nice short film, I suppose, say, ten minutes at the most.
B000F3T7RE|5.0|I've been through this collection three times so far and am delighted with it in every aspect. True, I haven't picked up the scores yet, which would add a great deal, but even short of that I can recommend this performance both from an acoustic and aesthetic point of view. And the music, of course, speaks for itself. Big bonus which shouldn't be is that the discs are pressed (burned?) in numerical order 1 through 15 so you don't have to keep switching discs like you do with, say, the Alban Berg Beethoven integral.<br /><br />Can't think of a single complaint, and I've tried! OK, there is one. I'm afraid that the notes that accompany the recording are pretty uninformative. A little historical fact followed by vague and misleading metaphorical descriptions are about the sum of it. True, Shostakovich scholarship is just beginning so there is little to draw on, but still...
B00008BRDX|4.0|Although The Police's second album, Reggatta De Blanc, doesn't receive  the recognition of their other albums, it is a very underrated release and their best album next to Zenyatta Mondatta. Sting's tenor and bass playing were in fine form, Stewart Copeland's drumming continued to be very creative, and Andy Summers' distinctive guitar work was more upfront than on their future releases. Even though none of the songs hit the U.S. Top 40, the melodic \\"Message in a Bottle\\" and the sparse \\"Walking on the Moon\\" have now become timeless classics and continue to receive steady rotation on classic rock radio. While these songs are top notch, several tracks like the power-pop of \\"It's Alright for You\\", the solemn piano-driven \\"Does Everyone Stare\\", and the driving instrumental title track are just as good. In fact, the best track on the album is the seldom played melancholy love song \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You.\\" Other strong tracks include the reggae tracks \\"Deathwish\\" and \\"Bring on the Night\\", the frantic rocker \\"No Time This Time\\", and the humorous \\"On Any Other Day\\", which is the only Police track to feature a lead vocal from Copeland. All told, Reggatta De Blanc is a great album that would pave the way for the Police to become international superstars. Highly recommended.
B00005JP9V|5.0|Children of Men just came out today in Spain and it is fantastic.<br /><br />The story line is totally original and the acting is superb.  Clive Owen is captivating as a man caught between his sorrow from his past and the hope for a new world future.<br /><br />The basic premise is set in the year 2027 and 18 years ago women mysteriously stopped being capable of having children.  Society has started to crumble because all hope of the future has disappeared.<br /><br />Owen's character (Theo), an ex-activist, is pulled into an underground \\"terrorist\\" group that has found something that will bring hope to the world; but hidden agendas and distrust are threatening to pull the only hope left apart.<br /><br />The cinematography and set designs are top notch, and with a supporting cast that includes Michael Caine and Julianne Moore- it only takes a great story to that next level of excellence.<br /><br />Also the soundtrack is really well chosen and they use the music to great effect in some scenes; for example King Crimson's \\"court of the crimson king\\" is especially effective.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />January 5th.<br />I thought I would add that I just saw the movie for the second time today.  The visual poetry and thought provoking ideas have stayed quite strong in my mind since I last saw it in October.  The second time around the movie stirred up just as many thoughts and emotions as the first.<br /><br />As some of the other reviewers has mentioned this is a very real feeling science fiction. The problems of tomorrow in this film seem to align itself with many of the issues that we are burying ourselves in today like our growing dependency on chemicals (many with unknown side effects), or the waste that we put in our environment, and last and certainly paramount, the decreasing faith we have of anything beyond our sciences in which we measure reason, and rely upon.<br /><br />Children Of Men has become one of my favorite movies.  And I hope that anyone with a thirst for thoughtfulness gets a chance to see this brilliant movie.nt movie.

What was with the rocks and urinating on the door??  I found myself rooting for Grendel. Of the 33 people in the theater, 10 got up and left half way through.  This was a story of great heros, not neurotic children.  Too bad Gerard Butler's career has come to this. I hope the Beowulf saga ends here and no attempt is made to do a sequel as discussed in the director interview.  I would have been ashamed to put my name on this piece of work.
B0000029AP|5.0|A rough and tumble, powerhouse rock n' roll band, Aerosmith was America's answer to British Rock. 'Toys in the Attic', released in April 1975, may not be their greatest album (that would be the follow-up 'Rocks'), but it's pretty darn close. Building their success the old fashioned way as the late John Houseman would say (They earned it!), Aerosmith were the ultimate road warriors, playing America's high school gyms and social halls while worrying if they were about to get the axe from their own record company and they came to the symbolize hard rock excellence in the 1970's. The anthems are well known and probably overplayed for some on classic rock radio. \\"Sweet Emotion\\" will always be in my top three...the into, the outro, the sleeze, the sass...man its all there, including the voice box guitar! \\"Toys\\", the song, opens the album with primal urgency, kind of like Boston's own \\"Immigrant Song\\". \\"No More No More\\" is as good as it gets; lyrics (being on the road has got to be bitch!), arrangement, production - all flawless! \\"Round and Round\\" is Sabbathesque, as heavy as Aerosmith would ever get! \\"Walk This Way\\" bugs me now but it is still one of the most inflential songs of the last 30 years (rock and rap anybody). \\"Adam's Apple\\" is more my style, back when Cain was Abel! (check out the live version from 'Pandora's Box' with Joe \\"F'n Perry saying \\"this is hard work\\" before he launches into the riff!). Whatever drugs the band was doing, an oh my were they aplenty, they seemed to help them create this timeless material. An although Mister Tyler may not remember \\"You See Me Cryin\\" (that story is hilarious in the book \\"Walk This Way\\"), Aerosmith enthusiasts will never forget the merry-go round in 1975, the year that America threw her hat into the ring of hard rock greatness.

0805080120|5.0|I loved this book.  I've read several books on linguistics; but this has to be the best of the lot.  It's so fun to read that I didn't want to put it down.  (I even found myself laughing out loud several times while reading it.)  In addition to being fun to read, it's very informative.  I took a couple of linguistics courses in college, have read a number of books on the subject, and have studied the rudiments of several languages; but I think I've learned more about language from this book than I learned in all of my previous studies.  If you're a student of linguistics, foreign languages, or English grammar (or even if you have only a passing interest in these subjects), you've got to read this book.<br /><br />The purpose of the book is to explain how and why language changes over time:  How did we get from simple \\"me Tarzan\\" grunts to the complex linguistic structures of languages like Latin?  Why is the English spoken today so different from the English spoken only a few centuries ago?  How are the various languages of the world related to each other -- and how do we account for the similarities and differences between them?  In order to answer these questions, the book takes us on a fascinating (and fun) tour of language; delving into the often mysterious world of grammar, usage, and phonetics; shedding some much-needed light on everything from the multiple declensions of Latin, to the 3-consonant root system of the Semitic languages, to the seemingly bizarre discrepancy between French spelling and pronunciation, to the importance of word order, to why a \\"father\\" is actually a \\"pater\\", and how a \\"pod\\" became a \\"foot\\".  If you're into language, you won't be disappointed with this book.  It's very insightful.
0060574216|4.0|This book not only explains the differences between men and women but also gives strategies to each sex for dealing with those differences. For example men and women have different values. Men tend to value competence and accomplishments while women tend to value relationships. Women tend to express their caring by offering unsolicited advice that is often causes men to feel incompetent. Women need to express how they feel about their problems, while men interpret this as blaming them for their problems. Men often need time alone to solve their problems while women interpret this as not caring. If everyone practiced the methods in this book the sexes would get along much better. The book, however, is at times dry reading.
0156030306|4.0|This book is about a 32-year old retarded man, Charlie, who is made smart through surgery.  Scientists had previously tried this surgery on mice and though the mice got smarter, they rapidly declined.  Finally a mouse comes along that seems to stay smart (Algernon), and the scientists decide it's time to try the surgery on a human.<br /><br />Charlie is selected as the best candidate for the surgery, and he wants very much to be made smart.  The surgery appears to work, and Charlie becomes smarter every day.  Eventually, Algernon, the mouse, begins to decline. This worries everyone that the same thing will begin to happen to Charlie.<br /><br />What's interesting is that Charlie has become so smart that he is now smarter than the scientists who made him that way, and he begins to search for his own cures so he will not decline like Algernon.<br /><br />The book is written as a series of journal entries.  The grammar, spelling, and punctuation greatly improve after Charlie's surgery. Charlie is really a lovable character in the beginning series of journal entries.<br /><br />This is a good book with an interesting story to tell.  At the peak of Charlie's \\"smart period\\" the book becomes a little tough to follow, but overall it was fun to read.
B000CNFC76|1.0|This is a tired and threadbare tale that once again attempts to show the inherent nobility of the poor but honest working class versus the aboslute rottenness of the idle wealthy.  Why Disney feels that audiences want to be force-fed any more of this liberal clap trap is beyond me, but judging by the number of positive reviews in this forum, perhaps the studio is right: there's always a market for a trite, predicatble story in which the stuffed-shirt aristocracy gets its come-uppance from a working class underdog. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, neither the rich nor the poor in this story are very are  very likable, and it's hard to feel much empathy for any of them as they plod through life.  Viewers will do well to heed the advice given by Ouiment's 10-year old caddy, Eddie: \\"Keep your head down.\\"
1400032717|5.0|This book is partly a mystery, but mostly it's a vividly painted portrait of the view from someone else's head.  Christopher is our narrator, and he is wonderfully candid and frank with the readers as he takes us all on a journey through discovery.  A dog has died mysteriously in his neighborhood, and he wants to find out who did it.  Along the way, we discover more about the adults in his world than even he knows, since he lacks the ability to read expressions or fully understand what's going on around him the way a \\"normal\\" person would.<br /><br />My only complaint with this marvelously crafted book is that there is not a single point in the story that actually tells the reader precisely what is wrong with Christopher.  Had I not come to Amazon and read about it thoroughly before making the purchase, I never would have realized that Christopher is autistic, and my enjoyment of the book would have been lessened considerably.<br /><br />But since I had the fortune of not going in blindfolded, I was able to thoroughly enjoy this story, and if Mark Haddon ever decides to write more about Christopher (a novel in which he \\"finds a wife\\" as he says he will do after University would be particularly fascinating) I will be there with bells on, eager to read it!
0784011176|4.0|Like most artsy films, The Piano is a visual experience.  And, because it's an artsy film, it will be hard for me to explain why I liked it so much. As previously stated, the visual aspect of the film is mesmerizing and amazing: it's a great experience.  What gives this film it's strength is its visual expressiveness: meanings are shown through movements, gestures, expression, and of course, music, not words.   <br /> <br />I did not know of the feminist controversy surrounding this film before I saw it, but now that I know about it it still doesn't affect the way I see this film.  I don't think the point of the film is to make one see her as a strong or weak woman for choosing to do the things she does in her relationships with her husband and his neighbor George, but to see that her will is in control at all times.  She does what she wants; all the choices she makes are the choices SHE made.  As long as that continues to be true, she is still in control of her life, and that makes her a strong character.   <br /> <br />Performances are strong as well, especially Anna Paquin's character.  Holly Hunter as the proud, passionate Ada, Harvey Keitel as the desiring neightbor, and Sam Neil as the sadly pathetic yet pitiable husband, round off the rest of the powerful cast in this powerful movie.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|The great thing about this album is that being a Christmas/winter album, it feels authentic, and not like some lame way to cash in on a holiday.  This is mainly because it was released in October, which makes it stand out, and also just because the music is so good.  \\"Wintersong\\" is full of great, wintery tunes.  Heck, the cover of Joni Mitchell's \\"River\\" is worth the purchase alone, but the whole thing is great.   <br /> <br />So, be sure and put this on when the snow is falling, and the chestnuts are roasting, and all that good stuff.  It'll make the bitter cold feel that much warmer.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|If you're a person who can't be bothered to raise up from your \\"lazy-boy\\", put down the beer, and think for a minute... don't see this movie - because it gets you thinking, whether you like it or not. You can't NOT care about global warming. If you are informed enough about the issue, you'll know at what critical state, this little planet we call home, is in.  <br /> <br />This movie is very well made and intelligently set up to raise interest for the viewer in this issue, whether he has any opinions or preconcieved notiotons forehand about the issue of global-warming or not. <br />Al Gore is a man with great concern about the enviroment we live in, and is very dedicated to informing people around the world about what is actually going on and what state our planet is in, and also where we are heading if we keep going in the same direction in coming years. <br /> <br />This movie is NOT all; boring facts and blackboard graphs and numbers and so on... As many people might think of films covering issues of such great seriousness. It has very captivating scenery filmography and portrays various beautiful natural spots from around the planet and beyond. Al Gore presents the information and his researched facts in a very interesting, humorous, charismatic and personal way.  <br /> <br />This is a must see film for people living on this planet! Go see it, think it - and do your part!!!

0307237699|5.0|As the acknowledged rising star of the Democratic Party, Barack Obama has done an admirable job in maintaining the precarious balance between being a media lightning rod and a largely unproven senator out to establish his record. While it may speak to the current vacuity in the party's leadership, Hillary Clinton aside, Obama certainly cannot be underestimated for the political acumen he has displayed during key high-attention moments like his keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. He wrote an insightful personal memoir over a decade ago before entering politics, \\"Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance\\", which I read a couple of years back and thought was quite lucidly written if rather guarded in exploring his racial dichotomy.<br /><br />What came across in his first book was a unique voice, and even though he sticks primarily to politics this time out, his voice remains consistent, at least on the written page, and that's what makes this such a magnetic read. He has a personable way of tackling topics as diverse as foreign policy, religious faith and the U.S. Constitution without the taint of pandering that media-hungry pundits and other politicians seem to enjoy. There is no denying that Obama is an instinctive consensus builder and that quality may have alienated those who label him a centrist. However, we understand the genesis of this commitment through his journey to reconcile his own racial identity. The irony is that in this book, the senator presents a series of policy statements that hold a clarity in purpose lacking among his Democratic brethren while concurrently replicating the successful Republican approach of linking political beliefs to values. The senator's topics are broad-based as noted by the chapter titles - Politics, Opportunity, Faith, Race - but he doesn't lose himself in polemics within the text.<br /><br />Take for example, the chapter entitled \\"The World Beyond Our Borders\\" where Obama intertwines the political history of Indonesia with his own childhood there. This provides a logical springboard to explaining his increasing awareness of U.S. foreign policy and once elected to the Senate, his first trip to Iraq which leads to a broader discussion of Bush's current Iraqi policies. All his chapters start with a personal journey that brings a grounded authenticity to his own policies rather than what could be perceived as naïve rhapsodizing of what our democratic process should ideally be. Just by reminding us of the value and relevance of the Constitution, Obama already has a jump on most of his colleagues in the Senate. Whether he is seriously considered Presidential material in 2008 (or more likely in 2012) or sinks under the weight of the media hype, this is a most worthwhile insight into Obama, a conscience-raising activist who is admittedly undergoing a gestational period as a political leader on a global scale.the political history of Indonesia with his own childhood there.

0385512058|4.0|I found this book quite inspirational. Although I love spending time with people talking and getting to know them better, I've always been leery of the concept of \\"networking.\\" It brings to mind a picture of an insincere jerk working the room, brown-nosing the people who can help him get ahead and ignoring everyone else.<br /><br />This book changed that idea. Keith Ferrazzi helped me realize that networking actually means building the kind of relationships I deeply enjoy--long term relationships of mutual benefit, founded on mutual esteem and shared interests. I've already put several of his ideas into practice with great results.<br /><br />For example, he suggests recontacting anyone you meet within 24 hours of meeting them. In the past, I would have thought this to be too much--a bit of a wearing out your welcome kind of thing. But since I have started it, I find most people are glad for the recontact.<br /><br />He suggests speaking deeply to just two or three people at an event, rather than constantly looking over the shoulder of the person you are speaking to for someone better to talk to. I found this quite useful, because I was doing it anyway, but felt a bit guilty about not talking to more people at an event.<br /><br />He has the common sense idea of researching a person you would like to meet before meeting them, so that you will have something to talk about when do meet.<br /><br />Ferrazi empowers you let others help you. I am starting up a non-profit organization, and I find it very difficult to ask for donations, yet our work cannot go forward without help. Through stories of his own experiences, he helps the reader realize that giving others a chance to help is blessing for them, and not an imposition.<br /><br />He has some good ideas about what to do when meeting people for the first time, and I love his idea of keeping a list of people you hope to meet someday. He offers a good plan for keeping the relationships alive with long-term contacts too.<br /><br />His ideas about establishing relationships at conferences are right on, especially his suggestion to make a presentation of your own, and to help out with the conference as much as possible to gain access to those that will be there.<br /><br />The only complaint is that there does seem to be a bit more self-congratulation and name-dropping than necessary, but it doesn't keep the essential ideas from being true.<br /><br />This has become one of those books that I reread frequently as I seek to assimilate the valuable contents it has. I highly recommend it to anyone who could benefit from widening their network of friends and who would like to learn how to make mutually beneficial relationships with anyone.-term contacts too.  <br /> <br />His ideas about establishing relationships at conferences are right on, especially his suggestion to make a presentation of your own, and to help out with the conference as much as possible to gain access to those that will be there.  <br /> <br />The only complaint is that there does seem to be a bit more self-congratulation and name-dropping than necessary, but it doesn't keep the essential ideas from being true. <br /> <br />This has become one of those books that I reread frequently as I seek to assimilate the valuable contents it has.

B0007P3582|2.0|As I've stated in many reviews in the past, how many times must people who don't even listen to the music attempt to 'review' a product? It's highly annoying when someone degrades a product, because of preconceptions on it, without even delving into it, and listening to it yourself. If you've added something constructive to the arguement of why this music is horrible, then fine; I can see where your opinion derives from. If you're a narrow-minded metalhead who spends all day eating Twinkies and listening to Meshuggah in his mother's basement, a Game fan who can't see that both Game and 50 are highly overrated, or an underground head who doesn't accept any album that's not crafted by 7L & Esoteric, then why even bother wasting your time reviewing an album you've never personally listened to? I hate 50 Cent as much as the next person, but I won't bring cheap quips to a product I have no prior knowledge of, and call it a review.    That being said, 50 Cent's The Massacre is a failure of an album; not an abortion, but most definitely a failure. While it does admittedly have more substance than something released by Dem Franchize Boyz, 50 Cent, who was average at best to begin with, had descended even further down the abyss that is his career. Only the production and a few shining spots save this from one star territory.    The production on this album isn't nearly as strong as on The Game's documentary(hence the reason i rated that one star higher; both Game and 50 Cent are excruciating lyrically), but on the spots that the production does shine, it glimmers brightly. \\"My Hood\\" is like the sequel to \\"What Up Gangsta,\\" from GRODT, \\"Candy Shop\\" has a hypnotizing beat provided by Scott Storch, \\"I'm Supposed To Die Tonight\\" is like \\"Many Men\\" Pt. II, \\"This Is 50\\" carries another great beat, \\"Outta Control\\" is Dr. Dre's superior outting on this album(and only one of two tracks), \\"Piggy Bank\\" is another hard beat from Needlz, and \\"Get In My Car\\" is a nice piece of productionhandled by the vastly talented Hi-Tek. Unfortunately, only half of the album exceeds musically; and only on two tracks does 50 Cent show any promise lyrically.    \\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\" is a nice concept song coming from an artist who is very formulamatic; and the aforementioned \\"I'm Supposed To Die Tonight\\" is just as well written as anything 50 Cent's ever penned. I'm not sure if that's actually a compliment, but it is better than mediocre.    This isn't a balanced album; in fact, it's highly uneven, and is definitely leaning on the 'wack' side of the scale. GRODT was only slightly better though, and if you're an actual fan of 50, I'm not sure why you dislike this album; it's not like he's drastically changed in the time between releasing albums. If you hated 50 before, then this is just more ammunition for your arsenal.
0684824906|4.0|Lincoln has been the focus of seemingly endless analysis, yet Doris Kearns Goodwin offers a fresh and illuminating perspective.  By focusing on the men around the president, Goodwin portrays Lincoln as a remarkable judge of human character, a consummate conciliator, and a man of remarkable wit.  Goodwin obviously writes well, although her spotlight on so many players does confuse the reader a bit.  She is a talented historian, and this is another solid piece of work.
B00004TX5F|5.0|The Baroque era was definitely a strange one!  Yet for all it's \\"Baroque-ness\\", it still finds in the modern audience a sense of understanding and connectedness that continues to echo through the centuries.  Perhaps this is why this vivid tale of the castrato and his yearning to reconnect with his humanity touches us so deeply.  And while it is true that there are fictionalised portions of this film, Gerard Corbiau has achieved a wonderful balance between the actual events and the practicalities of story-telling, to deliver a sumptuous drama imbued with all the depth and soul that such a tale demands.    The performances are quite stunning.  Criticisms of Dionisi's lip-synching have been overrated - by a criterion of how affected one's enjoyment of the film is by it, it barely rates a mention.  He really did a wonderful job, and given that we longer have access to the castrato voice in its eighteenth century prime, the technology behind creating its other-worldly quality is actually rather remarkable.  I give this film a solid 5 out of 5, for what is a grand example of excellence.
0618680004|3.0|I once believed there could be no God and probably would have read this book with enthusiasm; however, when my little girl was born, I knew she hadn't \\"evolved,\\" and that I was somehow connected to a power that helped me to create her.  Dawkins is way too emotional, and far too spiritless.  I graduated from Oxford, but I have maintained a sense of reality that we are not alone.  People who want to read this book probably also suffer from a fear of God that has been rationalized by institutionalized religion.  Religion is not faith.  Religion is not God. For a better understanding of God(so you'll have no delusions) read Wayne Dyer, Andrew Weil, Rayna Gangi, even Deepak Chopra.
6305127697|2.0|The acting was good (really liked the kid, especially watching him switch back and forth like that; always enjoy Frances McDormand's performances). The story line was good - the suspense was fun, the depth of the characters made it really interesting. The ending - well - not so incredibly surprising as they would have you believe.     WARNING: SPOILER ALERT==SPOILER ALERT==SPOILER ALERT==SPOILER ALERT==SPOILER ALERT==SPOILER ALERT==SPOILER ALERT==SPOILER ALERT    I had started to speculate that maybe the kid was faking the little Multiple Personality Disorder piece. But the psychological tension steers you away from that suspicion - until that 'twisty' ending - when it turns out that the kid isn't dissociative, he's just an evil sociopath.    What I found truly sad was the last line of the movie: \\"hey, love hurts!\\" Upshot of the story: The cynical, arrogant lawyer finds his soul, and his heart gets broken. The end. I just hated the ending of this movie. There was no meaning to it. The moral of the story was that it just doesn't pay to believe in anything. It could have been a great movie, if the ending hadn't been so bleak and pointless.
B000HKDB72|5.0|I'm not often ever moved enough to write up a review on a new artist because being a child of the 80's, and usually stuck there, I too often snub new artists as rip offs from prior bands. Too many new bands lack originality, or just flat out lack talent. The problem these days with music is that a cd is released with one or two really good songs and the rest with filler. God, I miss the days when I'd buy a cd and it was brilliant from beginning to end. <br /> <br />Finally, alas, a new band that has really come through 100%. Originality? I'd have to say yes, sure there are many influences but the Fratellis have somehow crafted their own style. And what's present here that is usually missing these days? EXCELLENT MELODIES! This is such fun music to blare in the car and sing aloud to. Another incredible feat is that each song stands on its own. With each track, it's like a new story different than the one prior to it. How drab it is to listen to a cd and feel as if you just listened to one long boring track. Definitely not the case with Costello Music. <br /> <br />I've seen in other reviews this band being compared to others...in my opinion, they have a lot more going for them. Any band that can come up with truly catchy melodies these days are a true gem. A flash of the late 70's punk era, mixed with a splash of the Clash and Madness with some odd musical dashes of the 50's. What a mixed feel it is, but really a nice one. I guess that's what makes it sound fresh, new and original. Common ingredients but an entire new outcome.  <br />
B000F48CD8|5.0|The Raconteurs is the supergroup comprising Jack White of the White Stripes, and friends Brendan Benson, Jack Lawrence and Patrick Keeler, the latter pair from the group The Greenhornes.<br /><br />With 10 songs clocking in at 33.7 minutes, each song stands out, from the opening retro rock/pop sound of the charming `Steady as she goes', the grittier rock sound of `Hands', the middle eastern/cowboy sound of the brilliant `Broken toy soldier' (with snarling vocals), each song is dizzyingly diverse in sound.<br /><br />There are the ballads; `Intimate secretary', Together', `Call it a day', and the Beatlesque `Yellow sun'.<br /><br />`Level' is a rocker with a screeching, distorted sound, `Store bought bones' with racing guitars and a catchy refrain.<br /><br />Closing is the epic `Blue veins', a reaching seventies sounding rock ballad.<br /><br />Too brief, but brilliant!!! Definitely one of the best albums this year.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|This movie is brilliant.  It is one of the most romantic movies in years.  I personally like it after seeing it.  For the story, it is so good because this movie fills with ups and downs, from the scene of the falling in love to the death of one of the main character's father.  It's all-good.  For the acting, it is fantastic.  As everybody remembers, this movie sees Reeves and Bullock film together in the same movie since \\"Speed\\" 12 years ago.  I think since I watched \\"Speed\\", they are no doubt that the best to play lovers again since that explosive movie.  For the direction, the movie has a very logical direction.  For the visuals, it is okay and the lake house scenes are fantastic.  For the music, this is the best part in the movie because all are fantastic and romantic.  All music that the movie selects suits that movie.  This is the same as the sound effects.  So, this movie is so brilliant and it is totally recommended.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I got John Mayer's debut `Room for squares' after hearing and falling in love with the brilliant song `Neon'.<br /><br />`Continuum' is his third and best yet studio recording. Rock, tinged with jazz and blues best describes this.<br /><br />From the retro soul sound of opening track (and US top 20 hit) `Waiting on the world to change', the brilliant, almost brooding `I don't trust myself (with loving you)' (my favourite), the sunny `Belief' with poetic lyrics about the consequences of holding blindly onto one's belief, every song is brilliant!!<br /><br />`Stop this train' is a more downbeat, almost folk sounding song with Mayer's voice as smooth as silk. `Slow dancing in a burning room' is a lovely, downbeat blues-ey song with excellent guitar work.<br /><br />`Dreaming with a broken heart' is a tender piano driven ballad, `In repair' a lovely organ sprinkled ballad, while the brief `I'm gonna find another you' takes the album out on a slow, retro blues note (and a very soulful vocal performance too).<br /><br />Songwriting, vocals, and production are top notch. A classic!!!

B000FTWB7G|4.0|Though their first major label release 'Fallen' was fair to me, I felt Evanescence could do no wrong with their next release. With 'The Open Door', they did better than right. <br /> <br />Amy Lee's personal issues and personality is all over this project in spite of the song writing infusions of guitarist Terry Balsamo. Without Amy Lee this band is not unique; with her she brings a vocal presence that very few in music can match. Dare I say vocal charisma? How else do I describe it even on the album's weaker efforts such as 'Lithium' and 'Lose Control' other than her ranges cover her own mistakes. <br /> <br />The arrangements are very strong, particularly on the energy tracks: of course the best of them all the released single 'Call Me When You're Sober': a glaring indictment of Lee's relationship with ex-Evanescence lead guitarist and songwriter Ben Moody. Though the whole album itself focuses on Lee's demons at is relates to Moody, 'Sober' does what first release singles should always do: summarize the absolute theme and power of the entire album; it does so with a little too much weight in technoinstrumentals that all the nu metal types just overuse. <br /> <br />What keeps it from five stars is, like with 'Fallen', I find Amy Lee in the wrong musical genere; her voice talent can do better things than nu/goth/death pop metal. And her voice alone could make any song creepy when she chooses, so it made little sense to me that the instruments had to be so creepy sounding as well. Still, this is a lot stronger effort than 'Fallen', and unfortunately for the rest of the music industry this is the best stuff I've heard all year.
0618680004|2.0|Richard Dawkins's book gives good evidence for the God of the Bible, when it affirms the improbability of a complex God, composed of multiple physical elements of an highly improbable combination.     There is no such God in the Bible. That's only Dawkins imagination.     The Bible postulates an eternal, spiritual and triune God, not a complex physical God.     God is the Creator of matter and energy and the one directing it's improbable combination to form material objects and life.     God is not a highly improbable combination of multiple parts pre-existing matter and energy.     Galaxies, stars, planets, Earth, life and human beings are.     God directs the inprobable combination of matter and energy to create material objects an life through information.     In the case of life, we are dealing with coded information. All observations tell us that coded information has always an intelligent source.     Mutations introduce noise in pre-existing coded information. That's why they are overwhelmingly deleterious and cause many diseases and even death.      Mutations and natural selection degrade and reduce the coded information in the genomes.     When Richard Dawkins speaks about the sins of the people mentioned in the Bible (v.g. Noah, Abraham), he is only corroborating the biblical teaching  according to which we all are sinners. Only God is Holy.     Holyness requires moral clarity and the will and power to punish sin. Both individually and collectively.     Dawkins seems very surprised and schocked at individual and collective punishment in the Old Testament, to a childish degree.      But history is full of individuals and nations that were punished for their sins. That is not something we see only in the Old Testament.     Germany was bombed, divided and occupied after trying to exterminate the people of Israel. The Palestinians are right now suffering the same fate, because they overwhelmingly share the same extermination goal. It's sad, but it is true.If we take seriously what the Bible teaches about collective punishment of nations, we could avoid some further suffering.     This is probably not politically correct. But things are what they are.     The standards of justice and love are established by the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, weather we like it or not. They are not established by the UN General Assembly nor by the UN Security Council.      But God is not only Holy and Just. He is also love.     That's why he sent is Son, Jesus Christ, to die for our sins and rise again with an evertlasting body, free from corruption, decay and death.      Jesus death on the cross combines justice and love. 100% justice, and 100% love. That's God mathematical formula. It works pretty well.     There is no scientific, technological or mathematical way to deal with evil and punishment.     In the XXI century, in our sophisticaded scientific societies, crime and punishment are all around, nationally and internationally.       There is stronger empirical and historical evidence that Jesus rose from the death 2000 years ago, than that life originated from inorganic chemicals by chance, 3,8 billion years ago.       In fact, Jesus is called the Creator of Life and The Word. And life is dependent on codified information.     In all known cases (v.g. books, computers, mobile phones, ATM's) codified information has always an intelligent source. There are no kown exceptions.     DNA has codified information with a quantity, quality, density and complexity that far transcends human scientific and technological capabilities, for which there is no plausible naturalistic explanation. ~    Even Richard Dawkins acknowledges this.     So, the only reasonable and empirically sound conclusion is that the codified information we find in DNA could only have had an intelligent source.     That's why all naturalistic attempts to explain the origin of life (v.g. prebiotic soup, RNA world, hidrothermal fountains, mud, rocks, ice, space) keep failing.    Coded information is alawys evidence of intelligence. And in DNA there is plenty of it.
B000006MV8|5.0|A masterpiece, timeless even at inception. And considering the history of Badfinger, it's even more precious; listening to it transports me to a time and place like no other music.  <br /> <br />Song after song, expertly-crafted, gorgeous power pop at its finest. Yet as a total work, it is so much more...there always was this odd, old-soul patina about it, like a dream in an abandoned ballroom with the faint, shimmery strains of some orchestra long past..a tinge of almost prescient sadness for what would soon befall the band. <br /> <br />Whenever I hear \\"The Name of the Game\\", it makes me cry. Every time. I am among those who know this is a crown jewel of its genre. Pete, Tommy, and now Mike...you left too soon, never realizing how you touched us all. Thank you for what you left behind.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|I was concerned at first about this record because most artists who do as well as Evanescence did with their most recent record have a tendency to fall into a slump with thier next record.  The Open Door, however, has no such problem.  I find myself likeing this record more than I like Fallen, the first five songs in particular made me downright euphoric.  This is a terrific album, and I highly recommend it.
0465011047|5.0|Anyone who doubts that North Korea is an \\"Axis of Evil\\" needs to read this book. Kang gives a straightforward first-person account of his life inside an aquarium called North Korea, where there is only fear, propaganda, corruption, prisons, hard labor and starvation. He gives us his memoir of enduring all these hardships and his astonishment at the freedoms of South Korea, which present him with new challenges. If you want to know the truth about North Korea, it doesn't come much closer than this first-hand experience.
B000244FDW|4.0|A very nice rendition of the novel; the BBC does great work!  The sets are nothing to its 1995 successor, but the respective scores fit each.  Here, the music is very homey and \\"small-ish\\" to fit the image, and music for Collins is hilarious; in the 1995 version, the energetic score fits the opening scenes wonderfully.  Plus, this DVD beats the 1995 DVD on sound quality, hands down. <br /> <br />Jane (Sabina Franklyn) is terrific and I prefer her Jane, although I like Harker's; it is puzzling, though, when she beats on Darcy for snubbing Lizzy when Jane is supposed to think well of everyone. Mrs. Bennet is less shrill than her '95 version. Interesting interpretation of Anne (she likes Lizzy).  Mrs. Gardiner is done *very* well.  Lady Catherine feels truly like a rude *noble*woman, like she was born into her title.  Judy Parfitt's performance is, for me, the best. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the major drawback of this version is that the other side characters are not as good, and many are just plot-movers; in '95 they're fuller characters.  Mary's too hurt about being snubbed.  Charlotte is oddly very happy about Collins and de Bourgh, rather than contentedly resigned.  Moray Watson's Mr. Bennet doesn't work and is probably furthest from the novel.  He's far too severe and looks mad all the time and thus makes the lines of \\"sarcastic humor\\" seem harsh.   <br /> <br />The Bingleys are all right here, but it's hard to top '95's catty (and orange) Chancellor and the adorably eager Bonham-Carter.  Col. Fitzwilliam here is too stiff and serious, although he looks the part; he just doesn't measure up to Calf's '95 Fitzwilliam, who is the guy to a T (except Calf is too good-looking). <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />But it is a truth universally acknowledged that the success of a \\"P&P\\" version rides on its Elizabeth and Darcy, and this is where this one succeeds. <br /> <br />Elizabeth Garvie *is* Elizabeth physically--slight of figure, pretty, light brown hair.  The character,oddly, is a bit over eager; Darcy's criticism of Jane (\\"she smiles too much\\") works for this Lizzy.  She smiles so much during the Hunsford proposal that when Darcy accuses her of incivility he comes across as oversensitive.   <br /> <br />She also seems to care too much what Darcy and the others think; in this version, her desire to go home when Jane's sick seems motivated by how upset she is because of her hosts' behavior rather than the novel's reason of not wishing to be an improper guest who overstays her welcome. She also seems to fall harder for Wickham than the novel indicates.   <br /> <br />Even so, Garvie captures Lizzy on other levels.  She's funny and impertinent, just like Lizzy is supposed to be.  Her teasing Bingley is beautifully done, as in the novel, and her line that marrying Mr. Darcy would no doubt scare Anne is hilariously delivered, as is her conversation with Charlotte about Collins' hat.   <br /> <br />IMHO, the main problem with this Lizzy is a little inconsistency, and it seems more the inconsistency in the lines than with Garvie.  Besides caring too much what others think, she gets over Darcy's revelation about Jane and Bingley too quickly, and the Pemberley scene is done poorly (more on that later).  But all in all, still terrific. <br /> <br />My only objection to David Rintoul is that the novel doesn't make Darcy *that* uptight; Rintoul doesn't smile even a tenth of the times the novel says Darcy does.  At times he's so stiff and emotionless one wonders if Skynet didn't just send Terminators to 1984.  Still, Rintoul carries Darcy admirably and (at the risk of being pelted with rotten veggies) is a handsomer Darcy than Firth.  When he and Elizabeth are engaged and he finally smiles, it's beautiful, and it's all Darcy.  Much, *much* preferred to Macfayden's 2005 kicked-puppy looking Darcy. <br /> <br />Garvie and Rintoul carry the major scenes beautifully.  Whoever did the shot where we first hear Elizabeth play and sing is brilliant; everyone stands stock still, and we see only Darcy moving between them, watching her.  It's powerful in its simplicity.  Some of the voiceovers of Lizzy's thoughts are annoying, but some are good; one nicely supplies the ultimate paradox of how Darcy supplied objections to Jane for Bingley but loves Lizzy so much he can't help but bypass them for Lizzy. <br /> <br />Some complain '95's Ehle and Firth are too old.  If it's young-looking we're going for, I still prefer Garvie and Rintoul (whatever their ages) over Knightley and Macfayden, even if Rintoul wasn't that young when he did Darcy.  Garvie and Rintoul carry the relationship more closely to the novel. <br /> <br />As completely enjoyable as Garvie and Rintoul are - and they are *well* worth the 4.5 hours - my favorites are still Ehle and Firth.  Darcy isn't entirely stiff in the novel and smiles quite a bit even in the first half.  Firth makes these tiny, unconscious smiles, and he shows hurt and delight far better even with the proud mask.  Ehle may not look the part, even with her wigs, but she conveys Lizzy's spirit the best - that sweet, pert confidence is always there, and until she discovers Darcy's true nature, it's very clear she doesn't care for his good opinion.  It's also far clearer when she's simply being polite and when she's truly happy; she doesn't use the same smile for both. <br /> <br />As for the visit to Pemberley: I'm no wet-shirt-maniac (I don't get it: he's fully clothed and the shirt doesn't even stick to him), and purists can say what they will about that 1995 dip in the pond :) , but that innovation does a far better job of explaining why Darcy doesn't receive the Gardiners and Lizzy properly the first time he sees them; he's half-dressed.  In  this version he sees them, he's unbelievably cold, and then suddenly he reappears all charming.  It's like two different Darcies.  Also, Ehle's Elizabeth is more consistent.  She's mortified she's going to seem a gold-digging floozy, so she rushes to leave; Ehle conveys her dismay brilliantly.  In the 1980 version, Lizzy's embarrassment is confined to a short voiceover, but she doesn't leave and otherwise looks perfectly content, all in sharp contrast to her condemnation of her sisters' flirty behavior with the officers.  The awkwardness of their first meeting after the Hunsford refusal is also done far better in the '95 version than in its '80 predecessor.   <br /> <br />Still, a fabulous version and a must-see for a \\"P&P\\" fan.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|Ok Evanescence is a band that had huge success with their debut release a few years back and that success was well deserved as that release was indeed stellar.<br /><br />When Ben Moody the bands guitarist/songwriter decided to split after that release and subsequent tour, many thought the success of the first release would be be hard to repeat since one of the main songwriters was no longer around. Well the search was on to find a replacement for the now departed Moody. However the bigger question was, who would write the songs along with Lee, and how could they duplicate that sound. Sure Amy had a hand in the first release as far as songwriting goes, but Ben was the main man.<br /><br />So after a few years of waiting it's here, the new cd with new guitarist from a band that has much to prove even after all their success the first time out.<br /><br />How well does this stack up overall to the first cd? Well it's more atmospheric than Fallen. It's less commercial sounding than Fallen and it's not as catchy as Fallen. However overall I'd say it's a better effort in many ways. The sonic wellness is all good in The Open Door. It has many sweet sounding chords and melodies that flow along wonderfully. As I stated before, it's not chalked full of instant hits, but it's a better sounding more cohesive effort. It's just a well rounded release that proves that Evanescence has life after Ben Moody. Will it sell as many copies as the first one did? Probably not, but is that really all that matters? This release is a better cd than the first one period.<br /><br />Atmospheric metal?, probably not!, a good sounding cd with an edge to it is pobably a more appropriate title for this effort.<br /><br />Easily a 4 out of  5
0691126887|4.0|I just got the book and in short, was very impressed.  The book fills in the gap in the taxonomic order not covered in the famous Birds of South America Vol. I & II by Ridgely and Tudor.  The book is small and compact (5\\" X 7.5\\").  The illustrations are great...a bit crowded on some pages (as can be expected with the size), but overall are visually appealing and birds are identifiable (unlike other Princeton Illustrated Checklists I've seen recently).  The book is just that though, an illustrated checklist.  Each bird is illustrated on one side with a corresponding paragraph describing the bird and habitat on the opposite side. Each species has a small range map next to the text block as well.   <br /> <br />The only errors I've seen so far is that some birds are do not have a numerical label, matching their illustration with their name/description on the other page.  These are few in occurrence and don't pose too much of a problem, but obviously overlooked by the editors.  One other thing, some of the birds, particularly some of the hummingbirds, have been painted as you may see them in a shaded forest (without any iridescence)...thank God the Velvet-purple Coronet doesn't always look like that! <br /> <br />Overall, this is a great book to add to your collection or to use in the field if that sort of thing is lacking where your going.  Its a bargain and recommended.
B000GCFO0I|1.0|I was hyped up for this film after reading all the rave reviews on Amazon but afer 40 minutes of this film I had to turn it on..the first film I have done this in years. I cannot for the life of me understand how the film scored so high. It's a pity I have to give it even 1 star!
0375422307|5.0|I loved this book! The art is simple, yet powerful. The story, informative, heartwarming and compassionate. And all done by one person, which is not all that common. I actually FELT for the characters, I felt like I knew them. That's a sign of great storytelling.<br /><br />This book was recommended to me by Scott McCloud. I have to say, one of the better graphic novels I've come across yet.

1401302378|3.0|If you became hopelessly depressed after reading \\"The Winner-Take-All Society\\" by Frank and Cook, then \\"The Long Tail\\" will provide you with some solace. Nothing ever reaches its logical conclusion, and economic rewards will not aggregate to the top ad infinitum. The ability to make an infinite number of copies of the \\"best\\" song or movie or book contrasts with the infinite shelf space available on the internet. \\"The Long Tail\\" demonstrates why that shelf space will be a highly democratizing force. People are always looking for something new, and the traditional, monopolistic channels (or gatekeepers) are under siege, even now.
B000F4LPJ6|3.0|I'm not sure what all the fuss is surrounding this movie. Sure, it is violent, but the violence itself was nothing more than slightly-creative killing with computer-added blood splashes. Really. Lots of gunshots, stabbings, but considering that all the kids were wearing explosive neckbands, you'd think there'd be \\"heads-a'-poppin.'\\"  <br /> <br />..but no. <br /> <br />In fact, though the countdown of deaths throughout the movie was a nice touch (adding to the \\"game\\" feel), the directors didn't spend much time exaggerating death or making it outlandishly violent. Rather tame by other Japanese films' standards. So, if the violence isn't the pull of this movie, then what is? <br /> <br />There is a small undertone of loyal friendship and personal justice interwoven to the story. While it's a bit far-fetched and poorly acted, it exists. Even the \\"bad guy\\" of the film comes off as being a little sentimental at the end. It doesn't work in the film, but it was possibly an attempt to make the movie more mature than it was coming off as. <br /> <br />Purely a fantasy movie due to the content and story, I had hoped the violence and the atmosphere were also more creative. This could have been an ultra-violent bloodbath, but for some reason, the directors chose to keep the violence simple and try to make us sympathize with certain characters. Unless you've got a keen eye and a knack for memorizing Japanese names, you may find yourself confused as to who you're supposed to \\"root for\\" and who you are supposed to dislike. (These kids look a lot alike.) <br /> <br />I give the film a solid three stars because it was interesting, but it was very, very weak in many parts. Violence was weak, story was underachieving and the ending was probably more sappy than it was poignant.  <br /> <br />Though it would have been a throw-away shockfest, I would have prefered it to be an all-out killing spree movie. At least that way, it would have made more sense. <br /> <br />
0060786523|5.0|This is a great book....I've read it twice, once over about two weeks while traveling, again over 6-8 months, & loved it both times.  But part of what made it so good the first time is that I didn't know the outcome....Unfortunately some Amazon reviewers have seen fit to give away the ending.  So if you want the full experience, stop reading the reviews right now (hopefully it's not too late) & just read the book.  It won't disappoint you.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore has made what is a moral issue also one that is interesting and touching.  His call for us to ACT TODAY to protect our planet is so compelling no one with a heart can ignore it.  Even the most selfish of human kind .... yes, yes, I mean the Bush people and all the politicians - should see they can benefit from it and hence there no reason NOT to act on it.   <br /> <br />TAKE ACTION TODAY AND SPREAD THE WORD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000HEWEEY|5.0|Forbidden Planet deserves all of the praise accorded it by my fellow reviewers. Please allow me to submit for your viewing pleasure a brief list of things to watch for during this film.<br /><br />We are all familiar with producer Irwin Allen's TV series like Lost in Space and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.  Many of the cool design features in these TV series were lifted directly from Forbidden Planet.  I don't know if this was Allen's idea or that of his production designers.  Here are a few items to watch for and compare  in his TV shows.<br /><br />In Forbidden Planet we see the first use of a saucer shaped U.S. space craft, (called  cruiser C-57-D) which inspired the design of the Jupiter 2 in Lost In Space.  The \\"Astro-gater\\" on board said saucer, a glass domed device with a moving mini-saucer inside it to simulate the ship's position in space, is copied for the same purpose in the Jupiter 2- it is the cool floor-standing machine in the middle of the main deck!  Notice the landing gear of the saucer incorporates steps inside each of the legs- and so do the Jupiter 2's.  Robby obviously inspired the robot on the same show, not to mention the \\"freezing tubes\\"  for crew suspended animation; and the Robinsons even have outdoor forcefield projectors just like the ones in Forbidden Planet!<br /><br />In the TV series The Time Tunnel, the overall design of the whole complex, with it's view of a canyon-deep, multi-story underground city, is lifted directly from the same construction of the Krell.  The wide-shot used in Tunnel's first episode, of the tunnel itself, is a matte shot using the same artistic style as that in Forbidden Planet.  Look at how the lights are handled as they give us a disappearing perspective.<br /><br />Forbidden Planet is also famous for it's sound-music track which exclusively used  the Therimin electronic sound instrument, used earlier to great spooky effect in The Day the Earth Stood Still.  But did you know that the device was invented in Communist Russia in the 1920's?  When the inventor, Therimin, would come to the U.S. to demonstrate it in concerts, he conducted espionage against our country on behalf of the NKVD, Stalin's spy agency.  Nice guy, huh?<br /><br />An almost \\"sister\\" film, is Universal's big budget blockbuster This Island Earth, which features several design elements in common with Forbidden Planet:  More plexiglass \\"freezing tubes\\", a saucer shaped ship and a tram ride to show off the marvels of the alien civilization.<br /><br />Irwin Allen had no monopoly on borrowing from Forbidden Planet, either.  Whether by design or accident Star Trek may have done the same thing.  Leslie Nielsen's crew scans the planet Altair 4  for structures and other signs of civilization just as the Enterprise uses it's 'ship's sensors' to do the same thing.  When landing his ship Leslie Nielsen looks into microscope-and-viewer type instruments in much the same way Spock uses his science bay station on the bridge of  the Enterprise.<br /><br />Have any of you ever noticed  how many of the set pieces and props turned up in other studios production's and even TV shows?  Look for things like the Krell power gauges and the crewmen's uniforms on programs like The Twilight Zone, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea and many, many other \\"B\\" sci-fi pictures made after 1956.  I recall that the flying saucer that lands on Agnes Moorhead's roof in one episode of Twilight Zone is the miniature of the U.S. space cruiser from Forbidden Planet.  She takes an Axe to it !  (Fortunately you can tell in that shot that it is a different model that is shown chopped up- thou shalt not mess up a rented prop!)<br /><br />I'm sure many of you can find even more things copied from this wonderful, ground-breaking film which have been used in other productions.

B000E33VWW|3.0|Phillip Seymor Hoffman gives the performance of a lifetime.  He has the character down.  It may not always be 100% accurate, but it is spectacular.  <br /> <br />However, the movie the dull and slow.  It plods along with a snails pace.  There is no reason why movies like this should be paced like this.  Keeping people's interest is key.  Anyone who has seen Ray knows you can keep a story going and not get bored.  <br /> <br />It's not a bad movie, but it expects you stick around just for Hoffman and that just doesn't cut it. <br />
0780627024|5.0|This is an awesome film!!! The whole concept is totally ingenious. The effects of black and white and color together on one screen is absolutely remarkable. Qualtiy is top notch, as is sound and visual effects. Acting is superb and casting is perfect. Tobey Maguire is luscious in this film and gives a shining performance as a young man from a broken home, with  an unhappy life, who escapes reality engrossed in the black and white fantasy world of classic television sitcoms. A time when life was much easier, and everything was perfect without modern hardship. One day he finds himself and his sister thrown into the sitcom world of the 1950's, where he knows every line by heart and can act the part with perfection. Don Knotts, Reese Witherspoon (whom I usually don't care for), and a great cast of dozens, give outstanding performances in their roles. Not your typical movie. You'll be amazed by the special effects that mix color with black and white. A terrific fantasy film that yes is a bit silly in places, and very serious in others, but all comes together to make a great film unlike any you have ever seen before. I highly recommend \\"Pleasantville\\" to anyone who hasn't seen it. Hilarious comedy, a great look back at yesteryear with a flair. Back to the Future meets Leave it to Beaver? Well, you decide. Three thumbs up!
0060887303|4.0|Everyone has secrets. Rosewood, Pennsylvania is no different from any other town in that regard. Spencer, Aria, Emily, and Hanna all have their own secrets that they'd prefer remain that way. These are secrets that only one person knew: their best friend, Alison, who vanished four years ago without a trace.<br /><br />The girls, now high school juniors, have drifted apart. They're all living in the same perfect part of suburbia and going to the same school, but they've become very different people. Soon, though, something happens that rocks their world. All four of them are getting mysterious messages regarding their secrets, signed by the mysterious \\"A.\\" Could that be \\"A\\" as in Alison, the only one who knew their darkest secrets? Of course not. She disappeared four years ago. She's gone. Right?<br /><br />PRETTY LITTLE LIARS is a suspenseful, fairly well-written story that will have readers anxious for the next part of this four-book series, due out in the Spring of 2007. The story seems like it would work well on television--it leaves readers wanting more. The story is nothing profound or deep, simply entertaining. Still, it's enough to keep you occupied for an afternoon.<br /><br />The characters sometimes seem rather two-dimensional, but that could be due to the number main characters to get to know. Written in third-person, the book would have benefited from an alternating a first-person point of view; but the way Sara Shepard chose to write the novel works well enough to keep the story flowing nicely. PRETTY LITTLE LIARS is something to look for if you want to be entertained for a few hours, but it's not going to win any awards.<br /><br />Reviewed by Jocelyn Pearce<br /><br />10/20/2006<br /><br />3½-BOOKS on WUAT; 4-STARS on Amazon
1400043662|5.0|I have read a few other books by Murakami (Norwegian Wood etc), and this book is just as compelling and moving. The state is dreamlike and captures the reader immediately. It's sad, bittersweet, frustrating, lamenting & hopeful all at the same time.  <br /> <br />It takes the reader into another world. I couldn't put this book down! <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book. <br /> <br /> <br />
0307346609|3.0|A fun read that has a bit of difficulty maintaining a tone. Is this serious, sometimes its very serious, at others a bit comicbooky - as the narrative of war against the undead unfolds we have some rather uneven snap shots - but the highs definitely outweigh the lows. Recommend reading for Zombie or survival fiction enthusiasts.

B000E97Y6K|3.0|This was an entertaining movie, a lot of typical Holloywood stuff.  Good acting and cgi, but the story had to many huh?s and in some scenes, I had a feeling that there must have been something cut out.  ie why didn't the giant bats attack Kong at any other time in his life, were they jealous of the girl?  Whatever!  Guess they had to maximize the budget on cgi.  I like Peter Jackson's movies beacuse he's a great director and movies Look Great.
B0002S94OS|5.0|i say real metal because honestly, this is some of the realest metal i have heard in years. the biggest problem i had with Ashes of the Wake and Lamb of God in general when i first got into them was the vocals. i thought real metal contained only clean vocals and such, but after a few listens i realised that is not true. many times i have wrecked my voice attempting to immitate the dry, throaty croak that is Randy Blythe's vocals. and the reason i have done so is because YOU CAN ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND THE WORDS. most times with vocals like this you have to go and read the lyrics somewhere to understand them at all (New American Gospel...) but not here. almost every word can be easily understood.  <br /> <br />the one thing that truely makes this album stand out is the insane guitars. Adler and Morton do an excellent job here. these arent just your average CHUG CHUG guitar riffs found in a lot of metal these days, they contain variety, skill and in some cases, speed. on some occasions i can even hear traces of the seemingly long forgotten art of THRASH. all this aside i have to say that the riffs on this album are some of the most catchy and addictive riffs ive heard in modern metal. this doesnt go to say that this album is soft. this is, by far, the heaviest stuff ive listened to in a long while.  <br /> <br />PS, there are even a few GUITAR SOLOS thrown in.(One Gun) Good guitar solos at that. <br /> <br />the drums dont exactly stand out on here, but they dont need to, they keep the pace perfectly in every song. the bass can actually be heard rumbling in the background of a few songs which makes the rythm section that much better. lyrics found here are, as im sure you probably know, are very political. this kind of thing has never bothered me, but if you are one who doesnt like political issues brought up in songs, you probably want to look elsewhere.  <br /> <br />the things mentioned above lead me to believe that lamb of god is one of the leaders in modern metal. theyve got real talent, especially in the guitar section. this is how metal should sound these days. there are no bad songs on this album, they are all heavy yet unique, which makes 2 albums in a row with all great songs. <br /> <br />HIGHLIGHTS- Laid to Rest, Now Youve Got Something to Die For, The Faded Line, Break You.

B00008CLOA|5.0|I bought this album just because it was a SACD.  I have a SACD palyer with a great sounding stereo system to match.  This is an awesome album!  It sounds super on my system and I listened to the Dark Side of the Moon for what \\"seemed\\" like for the first time!<br /><br />My one quick word of advice would be to buy this album because you have the SACD setup and can truely enjoy the benefits of this format!  Don't buy it and put it in your car cd player or boombox, please!!!
B000001FI7|3.0|My brother hipped me to this CD a long time ago.  He was listening to it and I wanted to know who it was.  He told me, so I went out and got it. I liked it then and while listening to it a few nights ago, I remembered how much I still like it.  I can't even describe what kind of music this is and how wonderfully strange the lead singer's voice is.  Heck, I still don't know anything about Portishead except for the fact that I really like this CD and Glory Box is my favorite song here.  I call it the cheeba-smoking music.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|The buzz I remember from this when it was a theatrical release was how Natalie Portman's nude scenes were cut. Aparently they also cut the interesting and engaging dialog also. This could not have been any worse if they cast the teletubbies as the 4 characters as the actors. For the guys out there the strip club scenes did not have any nudity. Not that a film needs nudity, but this was a symptom of the pollitically correct crowd ruining a film. Not at all believeable acting. This film should be banned as a terrorist act. <br />I hated it, and threw out my copy, rather than sell it and subject someone else to it.
B0000797IO|1.0|. . . of about 50 minutes i'll never get back.  the movie is 93 minutes, but around minute 53 I decided I was so bored and didn't care what happened.  Like another review, I agree that characters were insulting and borderline offensive.  not quirky or interesting.  they're acting like people in big cities think people in small towns who work in dollar general type places act and think like that.  and did i mention it was boring?  so mind numbingly boring.  there are so many more movies that successfully accomplish what I assume this movie was attempting.  i can't be bothered to think of examples, because i'm working on regrowing the brain cells i lost watching this.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|The first - but hopefully not the last - movie based on the groundbreaking series of video games, \\"Silent Hill\\" is an utterly riveting, horrific, eerie, and pyschologically and conceptually deep film, one that may take multiple watches to really 'get' all the facets within it, particularly if one isn't familiar with the games. <br /> <br />   An adopted little girl named Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) is plagued by violent night terrors and sleepwalking in which she seems to be frantically searching for something.  She's unaided by conventional medicine, and after one night's nightmare-driven excursions nearly prove fatal, the girl's mother Rose (Radha Mitchell from \\"Pitch Black\\" and \\"Man On Fire\\") decides to seek out what her daughter screams for in her sleep - 'Silent Hill!!' - and upon discovering that Silent Hill is the name of an old town, heads off with Sharon in search or relief for her daughter, in what form she doesn't even know.  Her husband (Sean Bean, of the criminally under-noticed \\"The Dark\\" as well as \\"Lord Of The Rings\\", \\"Equilibrium\\" and \\"Flightplan\\") fears this is just going to do more harm than good and takes off after them. <br /> <br />   Upon arriving in the abandoned town, Rose becomes separated from Sharon and with the help of a policewoman attempts to find her, and the true terror begins.  Silent Hill is a town like no other, of which multiple versions exist concurrently, and which sometimes shifts between them.  It's a place of nightmares and monsters - brought to life with amazingly disturbing imagery and visuals - and the ancestral home of a Very twisted, corrupted version of religion.  And many of its old secrets focus right on the little girl. <br /> <br />   To touch briefly on the psychological and conceptual depth of the movie, I'm going to have to give away more than I normally do, so I'll preface the rest of this with <br /> <br />  *WARNING: SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD** <br /> <br />  Okay, there's a lot here open to interpretation, so the way I see some of the things toward the end of the film isn't neceasrily how everybody else is going to see it (and a lot of it is just hinted at, hopefully for possible expansion should they do a sequel), but there seem to be an awful lot of strange and fascinating undercurrents here. Basically - it never states this outright, but this is my take - there are places on Earth where if enough human cruelty and hatred comes out, it can open the door for those things to draw 'entities' or states-of-existance to come into contact with our world.  But this is a really interesting part - the demon Pyramid Head, from a certain point of view, seems to have come to empathize with the innocent more than with the cruel, and to be acting as an avenger of certain victims in the town's history.  That's not to say Pyramid Head is a 'good guy' rather than the 'bad guy' of the game, but it raises questions.  Can a demon come to feel compassion?, for example.  This goes with the whole flow of the video games, which has brought in questions of basically 'what horrors can twist the good into the abominable?', and has also played with the flip side of the equation. <br /> <br />   If there is a sequel, I don't know whether this angle will be followed up on, or whether it'll be left stand as an 'even the most evil can have some occasional virtue in there' thing without taking Pyramid Head from his 'terrifying villain' role, but either way has its merits.  \\"Silent Hill\\" is chock-full of revenge, evil characters, blood-ripping/bone-crushing horror, and the most ghastly visual imagery, and it's also loaded up under the surface with themes of love, compassion, and justice.  There's a strong interplay between characters, as with the games - you're never playing just a character out to save their own skin in the video games, there's always something of a group dynamic where there's someone your character is out to protect, and simultaneously where your character needs to take a chance on trusting other, possibly duplicitous, characters as well. <br /> <br />  It all combines brilliantly, and in this case gives us one of the best movies of the year.  A true great.
B00007J5VN|3.0|I love the widescreen transfer, several bonus features, and the Dolby Digital 4.0 encoding, BUT the film is missing over a minute of a key scene!

0743298020|5.0|The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield is a nicely paced novel in which the author, clearly a reader [much like those of us reading this book and writing these reviews], gives us an evocative journey and peek into several different, yet similar lives.  The ode to Brontë's Jane Eyre and  du Maurier's Rebecca are evident very early in this novel.<br /><br />Th joy of reading, and the numerous references to some of the classic novels that this great book paid homage to, displays the author's clear joy of books and reading/writing.  Her joy comes through in this wonderful book.<br /><br />The primary heroine of this novel, is a wounded lonely bookseller who writes biographies about people she has never met.  She is recruited by the mysterious Vida Winter [maybe it was Ms. Winter's home, but she reminded me of Agatha Christie] to wrire her biography.<br /><br />Thus the relationship begins between the two, and the first of many tales and lives are laid bare.  There are interesting characters, secrets, and enough mysteries in this novel to keep the reader hooked until they have read the last page.<br /><br />Very well-written.  An excellent read.<br /><br />I highly recommend this fine novel.
B00008EY9G|5.0|A group of seemingly unconnected characters become stormstayed at a remote motel, where one by one, they begin to disappear.  Sounds familiar but promising; while the promise is more than fulfilled though, the familiarity is not, as a classic kind of idea gives way to one of the most original and twist-filled movies around.  It's astonishing how cavalier the treatment of this movie was when it first came out, regarding its genuinely shocking ending - I had the misfortune of inadvertently reading the ending in a small ad prior to its DVD release!  Even with advance knowledge of the outcome, though, it was still astounding - I can only imagine how jaw-dropping it must be to witness it not knowing.  Fantastic suspense; great characterization as played by a cast of well-knowns including John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Rebecca DeMornay and Ray Liotta; excellent production values; and total non-telegraphing of the plot combine to make \\"Identity\\" one of the greatest mystery shockers of all time.  If you don't know the ending, do yourself a favor and see this one as soon as possible - the turns are some of the most unexpected ever.  Even if you do know the gist of it, don't hesitate to see it - it'll still deliver many times over.  Indispensable for fans of mystery, drama, horror, or thrillers.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|You knew going in this was not a movie for kids.  You knew the jokes would be offensive, sexual, crewd, and at times totally over the top.  Not sold yet?  Well that just about covers the opening credits.  This movie is no-holds-barred gutter humor with enough intelligence to not be insulting by the final credits.  HOWEVER, it is not for everyone and if South Park makes you uneasy, move along.<br /><br />I found the movie hilarious.  I think they tried to offend everyone and the Kim Jong Il bits are spot on...especially in light of current events.  The mocking of Hollywood celebrities was priceless...look for Matt Damon, Tim Robbins, Alec Baldwin and Janeane Garofolo to meet unglorious ends.<br /><br />For the real sicko's out there - you know who you are - the directors cut is a must.

The heading for this item still incorrectly states that it is a two (2) disc set. It does not mention that it is in some stange format no one in their right mind would buy. You can imagine my surprise when I opened the case and found what looked like some kind of strange contraceptive device. Don't order this!

B00005JPBP|5.0|Review: Christopher Nolan uses the skillful magician's art of misdirection in the powerful drama \\"The Prestige\\". Using a magician's slight of hand to direct the audience in this intricate story about the rivalry between magicians Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) set in turn-of-the-century England Nolan constructs a drama that deals with themes as old as Shakespeare's \\"The Tempest\\". The less you know about the plot of the film outside of what I've described the better as the film will unfold its mystery just as the best magician's tricks do with showmanship and a sense of awe. ***<br />Featuring a number of stunning performances everyone from Jackman & Bale to Michael Caine & David Bowie as Nikola Tesla one of the first men to harness the power of electricity shines in the film. Although Scarlett Johansson lights up the screen time Rebecca Hall (\\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\") as Borden's long suffering wife has the better, showier part in the film and makes the most of it.<br />***POTENTIAL SP0ILERS HERE GO NO FURTHER IF YOU WANT TO BE COMPLETELY SURPRISED BY THE FILM***<br /><br />Nolan constructs his story in flashback as we see Rupert Angier die during one of his tricks and Borden put on trial for his murder. Weaving back and forth in time Nolan paints devastating pictures of two very different driven men who use misdirection as the seeds of their lives and how that ultimately costs them both in tragic ways.<br /><br />***END OF SPOILERS***<br /><br />Based on science fiction and fantasy writer Christopher Priest's novel of the same name Nolan and his co-screenwriter/brother Jonathan Nolan (who co-scripted \\"Memento\\") do a marvelous job of keeping the audience orientated as to when the flashbacks that we are seeing took place. Since the film is less than chronological skipping back and forth (using the marvelous conceit of diaries that both magicians have kept about their rivalry, magic tricks and experiences) audiences will be very involved in putting the pieces of this puzzle together. As the tagline suggest you should watch this entertaining, clever and ambitious drama very closely as there hints throughout the film that will lead clever audience members to the conclusion before it takes place. That doesn't make the film any less satisfying however as it is a good example of modern filmmaking that doesn't place technique above content. The leap of faith necessary for the conclusion of the film will put some people off--after all it is played as a straight ahead mystery thriller for most of the film but it's precisely this unusual twist that makes the film so vital and entertaining. Certainly Nolan's dark film won't be for everyone but neither was \\"Momento\\" or \\"Insomnia\\".<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"The Prestige\\". Featuring a number of powerful, confident performances, a terrific script based on a top notch novel and sharp direction by Nolan the film continues to suggest he is one of our most talented film directors working.

0307346609|4.0|Zombies as a genre fit overwhelmingly into a visual medium, and there have been quite a few great zombie movies, \\"Night of the Living Dead\\", \\"Sean of the Dead\\", \\"28 Days Later\\",  as well as some fun zombie graphic novels, \\"Marvel Zombies\\".  Zombies are simple creatures that translate well to visuals with their sole moviation of kill, eat and infect. In \\"World War Z\\" Max Brooks takes on the zombie genre in the form of an intelligent oral history from the survivors of the global epidemic. Each chapter is the story told from a different survivor and organized chronologically from the start of the infections in China, throught the rise of zombies globally, the human resistance, and eventual human triumph. How do you translate the zombie genre from their success in the visual mediums into prose form? Mr. Brooks does exceedingly well by telling the human side of the horror story.<br /><br />Reading \\"World War Z\\" in kind of like flipping throught the cable news channels - getting the headlines and human interest stories. This is the story of humanity falling apart, in gritty detail. The zombies are a gimmick. The unknown horror that descends upon humanity could have easily been the avian bird flu, or some new virus, the true horror is in the human denial, lack of communication between nations, and the Great Panic that spreads like wildfire. Mr. Brooks has a keen eye for real world current events, the geopolitical, social and economic that he inserts into the novel. We're a step into the future, experiencing something unknown and this story feels so real because it is so well anchored the real world.<br /><br />The story becomes it's most terrifying when, \\"The monsters that rose from the dead, they are nothing compared to the ones we carry in our own hearts\\". What will we do to survive? How far will we go? What would we do to save humanity from extinction, and how would we live with our actions and sacrifices? These are the diverse stories of the human resistance and courage to fight back. As with the better zombie movies, this books tells us more about ourselves than the enemy. It's social commentary as horror-action fiction. Recommended.ourage to fight back. As with the better zombie movies, this books tells us more about ourselves than the enemy.

B000H7JD4K|4.0|I won't bother with a song by song review since there is enough of that from other reviewers...    If I had to take only one of Iron Maiden's last three albums with me on a long road trip this would be it.    I was dissappointed with Dance of Death, and while I rejoiced at the news of Bruce and Adrian rejoining the band for Brave New World, I thought that BNW only had a handful of standout songs.    AMOLAD is a stand out album.  It's rocks and is pretty solid from start to finish.    Let's face it, every ablum (especially new metal/rock albums these days) will probably only have 2 or 3 really good songs that you like, but you still buy the album for those songs anyway.    The more I listen to AMOLAD the more I want to listen to it.  It seems to deliver something new each time I play it.  This is something most of my newer metal purchases have not been able to do for me.    AMOLAD has a progressive sound, and doesn't attempt to cash in on previous, perhaps more critically acclaimed efforts such as Number of the Beast, or Piece of Mind, but then again, if all these guys did was pump out one galloping song after another then people would probably just brand them as being a slave to formula.    I think there is a lot of power in these songs.  Lyrically the songs are as thought provoking as any of their classics; the guitar work is fluid although I am still a little dissappointed that after 3 albums using the 3 guitar lineup I still can't really distinguish between their current 3 part guitar arrangements and their previous 2 part guitar arrangements, say for example from Piece of Mind where they seem to have used pre-recorded guitar rythm parts for their twin guitar solo efforts so it sounds like there are more than 2 guitars playing.    So while the 3rd guitar is not pre-recorded on AMOLAD it sounds as though at could have been. I would have liked to have heard some undeniably 3 part guitar arrangements which is ultimately why I have given this album 4 stars.    The base and drums are on the money.  Bruce has matured as a singer over the years and he does an excellent job of creating themes and weaving contrast into the songs by blending melody and urgency.    I think AMOLAD could have been the successor to Powerslave.  It has a lot of deep heavy riffs.      But don't expect to find any \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\" or \\"The Trooper\\" gems here.  Give it some time, this may turn out to be an unexpected classic album.      If you are a Maiden fan you should definately have this ablum in your collection.
0618680004|3.0|I found this book to be a passionate espousal of Athiesm, \\"absence of belief\\" <br />and a strong denunciation of \\"blind belief\\". The book is correct in its  <br />denunciation of Christian theology's insistence on faith or blind belief but <br />its strong advocacy of Athiesm leads to logical inconsistencies and flaws.  <br />Moreover, Richard Dawkins' treatment of Dharma systems and matters related <br />to India are seriously flawed at best and exhibits double standards at the  <br />very worst. I will cover these three issues sequentially. I will finally deal  <br />with my philosophical disagreement with Dawkins' entire approach. <br /> <br />I. CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY AND BLIND BELIEF <br /> <br />The book's strongest part is its strong criticism of the \\"blind belief\\" <br />approach advocated by Christian theology. Those parts should be required <br />reading in the western world.  <br /> <br />II. ADVOCACY OF ATHIESM AND LOGICAL FLAWS <br /> <br />The book is replete with logical flaws. I found them every few pages. I can  <br />only point out a few of them: <br /> <br /> Let us start with what Dawkins admits at the bottom of page 109: <br />\\"This argument, as I shall show in the next chapter, demonstrates that God, <br />though not technically disprovable, is very very improbable indeed\\". <br /> <br />God is NOT technically disprovable. What is the implication of this statement? <br />It means that Athiesm is ALSO a blind belief or faith system since athiests <br />can not be 100 % certain that their position that God does not exist is right. <br />Thus Athiesm is also exactly like Christian theology with its insistence on  <br />blind belief. Dawkins should either give 100 % proof of Athiesm or not try to <br />sell Athiesm instead of Christian theology. One shouldn't substitute one brand <br />of snake oil with another brand. <br /> <br />The illogic of Dawkins shows up in specially stark terms in Chapter 5 where he <br />discusses the roots of religion. I had to smile at the sheer illogic of using  <br />Darwinian theory in this area. Why is it illogical? It is illogical because  <br />since all religions are centered around the concept of God and God is not  <br />technically disprovable, Darwinian or any other scientific theory can never  <br />disprove the idea that these religions are derived from the Divine.  <br />Application of Darwinian theory in such a region of man's behaviour is a wild  <br />goose chase and it shows in the number of speculative attempts by Darwinians. <br /> <br />I could give many more examples of illogic but that would be just repeating <br />my point that Dawkins wants to substitute one set of blind beliefs for another <br />set of blind belief. Absence of belief (page 278) is also a belief! It is <br />in fact not true that Dawkins has no belief as can be seen by his comment on  <br />page 15, \\"I am only calling supernatural gods delusional\\".  If this is not a <br />blind belief then what is belief?  <br /> <br />III SHODDY SCHOLARSHIP <br /> <br />Dawkins writes on page 13 that \\".. if the word God is not to become  <br />completely useless, it should be used in the way people have generally  <br />understood it\\". Then on page 33, Dawkins accuses Hindus of sophistry , \\"His  <br />polytheism isn't really polytheism but monotheism in disguise. .... Lord  <br />Ganesh the elephant god, and hundreds of others, all are just different  <br />manifestations or incarnations of one God\\". <br /> <br />I found this behavior of first brushing aside the Hindu definition of the <br />Ultimate Reality in page 13 and then accusing Hindus of sophistry completely <br />unacceptable and unfair. It is completely unacceptable to not define God as  <br />Hindus do when describing Hindu ideas of One God. Dawkins does not tell the  <br />reader how Hindus do define God or Ultimate Reality. When Hindus talk of  <br />manifestations of one God they do not mean that this \\"one God\\" is a Personal  <br />God outside the universe. I will allow Sri Ramakrishna (1836-1886) the most  <br />prominent Hindu spiritual figure in the modern age to describe the nature of  <br />Ultimate Reality (bhakta means devotee): <br /> <br />'No one can say with finality that God is only 'this' and nothing else. He <br />is formless and again He has forms. For the bhakta He assumes forms. But He <br />is formless for the jnani, that is, for him who looks on the world as a mere <br />dream. The bhakta feels that he is one entity and the world as another.  <br />Therefore God reveals Himself to him as a Person. But the jnani - the  <br />Vedantist, for instance - always reasons, applying the process of 'Not this, <br />not this'. Through this discrimination he realizes, by his inner perception, <br />that the ego and the universe are both illusory, like a dream. Then the jnani <br />realizes Brahman in his own consciousness. He can not describe what Brahman <br />is. <br /> <br />Do you know what I mean? Think of Brahman, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss <br />Absolute, as a shoreless ocean. Through the cooling influence as it were, of <br />the bhakta's love, the water has frozen at places into blocks of ice. In <br />other words, God now and then assumes various forms for His lovers and reveals <br />Himself to them as a Person. But with the rising of the sun of knowledge, <br />the blocks of ice melt. Then one doesn't feel any more that God is a Person, <br />nor does one see God's forms. What He is can not be described. Who will <br />describe Him? He would do so disappears. He cannot find his 'I' anymore. <br /> <br />If one analyzes oneself, one doesn't find any such thing as 'I'. Take an <br />onion, for instance. First of all peel off the red outer skin; then you find <br />thick white skins. Peel these off one after the other, and you won't find <br />anything inside. <br /> <br />In the state a man no longer finds the existence of his ego. And who is there <br />left to seek it? Who can describe howhe feels in that state - in his own Pure <br />Consciousness - about the real nature of Brahman? There is a sign of Perfect <br />Knowledge. Man becomes silent when It is attained. Then the 'I', which may be <br />likened to the salt doll, melts in the ocean of Existence-Knowledge-Bliss <br />Absolute and becomes one with It. Not the slightest distinction is left.' <br /> <br />-  Sri Ramakrishna <br /> <br />(REFERENCE: The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna by M translated by Swami  <br />Nikhilananda) <br /> <br />Another example of shoddy scholarship is when he dismisses Buddhism as an  <br />ethical system or philosophy of life (page 38). If Buddhism is a mere ethical <br />system or philosophy of life, then what is the meaning of nirvana? <br /> <br />IV. DOUBLE STANDARDS <br /> <br />I am not going to criticise Dawkins for quoting from Nehru. Nehru's claims  <br />(pages 45 and 46) can easily be seen as false. Nehru speaks of organised <br />religion, dogmas etc. How can this be said of Hindu dharma when it is not an  <br />organised system (no church, no organised priesthood) and has no dogma? I <br />can't blame Dawkins for Nehru's illiterate comments. <br /> <br />I did, however, find Dawkins' double standard rather disconcerting. Dawkins <br />claims in page 260 that the killings during Indian partition are religious <br />killing. On the other hand in page 303 he writes,\\" The action of these four <br />young men have been nothing short of a disaster ..... for the whole Muslim <br />community in Britain, which now faces a backlash\\". So Dawkins has no problem  <br />in arguing that the muslim killing of 52 people in Britain ensured that  <br />muslims face a backlash in Britain. It is difficult to see on the other hand  <br />why Dawkins advances a monocausal explanation for Hindu muslim violence during <br />partition. He completely ignores the long and bloody history of muslim  <br />violence in India. Did it occur to him that Hindus are tired of muslim  <br />violence on them for the last 1000 years? According to some estimates muslims  <br />killed 80 million Hindus in their long 700 year rule. Their rule can be summed <br />up by this quote: <br /> <br />\\"If the revenue collector spits into a Hindu's mouth, the Hindu must open his <br />mouth without hesitation\\" <br /> -- Qazi Mughisuddin legal officer of Sultan Alauddin Khilji  <br /> <br />(REF:ELLIOT and DOWSON, The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians;  <br />The Muhammadan Period ( 1876-77)). <br /> <br />Even in modern times Pakistan has ethnically cleansed Hindus so that Hindus <br />now form a miserable 1% of its population. Kashmir valley is now 99.9 % muslim <br />which has been achieved by driving out half a million Hindus who are living a  <br />miserable life in refugee camps.  Bangladesh is slowly driving out Hindus. The <br />recent violence in India was due to the burning to death of 59 Hindu in a  <br />railway carriage in Godhra, India. Given this long history of muslim violence  <br />I don't understand why Mr.Dawkins expects no backlash but is very quick to  <br />expect British backlash against muslims for only 52 deaths. Surely even he can <br />see the double standard here! <br /> <br />There is another issue here that also reeks of double standard. That issue is <br />not the fault of Dawkins but merely shows the insensitivity of Western <br />authors and publishers. It irks Hindus that their Gods are written with small <br />g while the Christian One God is with capital G. <br /> <br />V. PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREEMENT <br /> <br />My main philosophical disagreement with this book is that it is written on a  <br />belief-no belief axis. Of course, no-belief is also a belief. It is not  <br />correct to replace one set of blind beliefs for another set of blind belief. <br />What is needed is to go beyond belief. One must use some method whether third <br />person empirical (science) or first person empirical (meditation, japa etc) <br />totest the God hypothesis. A life lived entirely on blind belief is not worth <br />living.
B000AWYOGE|2.0|\\"Dark Water\\" is the 2005 remake of the hugely successful Japanese movie, \\"Honogurai mizu no soko kara\\", released in 2002. American remakes of Japanese movies have had varying degrees of success - The Grudge and The Ring, risible sequels notwithstanding, had plenty more good points than bad ones, helping them to stand out from the mire of flash-flash-bang-bang 'horror' movies that Hollywood has deemed fit to release over the last few years. <br /> <br />Remakes are a tricky thing to get right: if it goes wrong you end up with what might essentially be a decent movie but is shunned by all and sundry because it's not enough like the original - or else too similar. Gus Van Sant's 'Psycho' immediately springs to mind - a great cast, beautiful direction and an extremely faithful remake which was shot down by critics and the public alike. <br /> <br />Which brings us to the first thing I noticed about \\"Dark Water\\", it's a very, very faithful remake of the Japanese movie, with some truer references to Koji Suzuki's 1998 short story 'Floating Water', which spawned the original film. Jennifer Connelly's character is developed more, we see more reasons for her apparent psychoses and the nature of her relationship with her ex-husband is further developed. Similarly, Ariel Gade as daughter Ceci is a more well-rounded, fully-realised character than Ikuko in the Japanese movie. None of this characterisation spills over into overstatement, either, which is a nice thing. <br /> <br />The script is really very good, there's a minumum of schlocky dialogue and next-to-no verbal diarrhoea or monologing, making this movie a refreshing change from so, so many of Hollywood's recent failed attempts at horror - \\"Omen 666\\" and \\"Silent Hill\\" immdiately spring to mind as stellar examples of lousy scriptwriting.  <br /> <br />On the acting front, Connelly and Gade give powerhouse performances as the mother and daughter duo plagued by the supernatural, and I must say, Ariel Gade's performance isone of the best given by a child actor in recent memory. Supporting cast turns are amply provided by the always-watchable John C. Reilly and generally so-so Pete Poistlethwaite. Dougray Scott turns in a great performance as Connelly's ex, his scenes towards the end of the movie make the character more human and more three-dimensional than his Japanese counterpart.  <br /> <br />Direction is competent, and, in places, very effective. Walter Salles' use of a very desaturated palette and lots of angular shadows lend a real sense of visual isolation to the movie, and, on the whole, \\"Dark Water\\" is a visually very pleasing movie. <br /> <br />So why only two stars? Well, I am sorry to say it, but \\"Dark Water\\" is just not frightening. It does not achieve what it sets out to do, it does not scare us. And that's a big, big shame, considering that most all of the other elements are very solid. Sadly, no amount of decent acting, good direction and a plausible script can save this movie from the fact that it's lost so, so much in the translation from East to West. What made \\"Honogurai mizu no soko kara\\" so wonderful was perhaps the ambiguity of the characters, their emotional unavailability providing plenty room for the audience's imagination to manouevre. In fleshing the characters out more, \\"Dark Water\\" removes that ambiguity, and leaves us with a very black-and-white retelling of a story where the grey areas should provide the thrills. <br /> <br />Disappointing, but you might enjoy it as a rental?

B000HEWEE4|5.0|An extraordinary movie, The Lake House, brings to the screen the story of a man and a woman who somehow manage to communicate through letters (and fall in love with each other) even though they are two... years apart!  <br />It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.   <br />Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!  <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!  <br />In short, The Lake House is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! <br />
B0000844I8|5.0|Straight up, I love \\"Stargate\\", and that is why I gave this a 5 star rating. I have been a big fan of the movie for ages and still consider it to be one of the best movies made ever.<br /><br />In this package, you get both the original theatrical release and the extended version of the movie. I question the use of \\"Ultimate\\" in the edition description, as the extended version adds very little to the story. In some cases, I agree with the decision to cut the scene from the theatrical release, such as the first scene of the ancient Egyptian lad running towards the huge pyramid ship. While the extras are great, they do not add all that much to the original movie.<br /><br />The Extra Features, on the other hand, are very interesting and worth a look at. I enjoyed them a lot, almost as much as the movie itself.<br /><br />\\"Stargate\\" is still one of the science-fiction greats that successfully blends history and science-fiction in one effective plot. It is a great movie with wide appeal, full of action and adventure. It is a bit predictable in some respects, but these are of small concern overall.<br /><br />This edition is very good for those who have not got a \\"Stargate\\" DVD, but for those who have already got one, it will add little to your experience of the movie.
B000003JA7|5.0|Call it what you like, this album is progressive because Jethro Tull married multiple musical styles on one album. The album is conceptual because the entire song is actually multiple songs married into one song by a variety of transitions and interludes. There may be an occasional unevenness in the transitions, but in general the whole thing works, and is a unique work of rock music.<br /><br />Early progressive rock was born in fits and starts. Tracing back, some of the earliest identifiable elements of progressive rock show up in some Beatles' songs. The Moody Blues provided more definition to progressive rock, and created the first progressive rock albums, though their progressive rock was on the lighter side and was much less daring than King Crimson, whose \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" established how cutting edge progressive rock could be. By 1972, progressive rock had a better-defined face, and that face was readily identifiable on albums such as \\"Fragile\\" and \\"Close to the Edge\\" by Yes, \\"Foxtrot\\" by Genesis, and \\"Thick as a Brick\\" by Jethro Tull. There were quite a few other progressive albums released by 1972 and numerous other artists used progressive elements in their music, but the albums listed above were among those that helped to define the limits, or lack thereof, of progressive rock.<br /><br />As serious as some of us like to believe this album is, it is a satire. This album pokes fun at issues contemporary to 1972, which somehow remain somewhat contemporary to now. Some examples: the drive to push society to cater to the needs of the \\"average\\" person rather than helping the above-average person develop their skills; the debate over war and the need for war; helping others to build their country and then having them go to war with you; people who live on the dole rather than being some useful part of society. The list is quite extensive, and much of the tone is sarcastic, often caustic, if you can discern the meaning.<br /><br />To match the extensive nature of the album lyrics are musical styles that range nearly as wide: there are catchy pop-like tunes; there are folk-classical influenced portions; there is a dirge in the second track; there are faster rock portions; even a bit of pomp and circumstance. I haven't even covered half the range of styles. At the very least, Jethro Tull wasn't afraid to commit their feelings of the moment musically to an album. Artistically their vision on this album is as expansive as any other group I can recall. Add to this broad range of styles sound effects and bizarre transitions and you can tell that not only did Jethro Tull use everything, they also threw in the kitchen sink.<br /><br />This album became a nearly instant classic in 1972. It vaulted to number one and for a while made Jethro Tull one of the biggest groups in rock, though their music was far broader than rock. The album was also anti-establishment (a term that hasn't been spoken since at least the early 70s). Though portions of the counter-culture lyrics are relatively plain, substantial other portions of the lyrics are subtle, nearly cryptic, and manage to poke fun at numerous institutions and philosophies. Some messages are so cleverly phrased and subtle that you could call Jethro Tull progressive rock for intellectuals, though you need not delve that deeply into Tull's lyrics to enjoy them.<br /><br />By the way, the phrase \\"thick as a brick\\" is slang for \\"stupid\\". I think Ian Anderson was already poking fun at those that wouldn't have the foggiest idea at what he was attempting to do with this CD, and already having a big laugh in preparation for the reaction after the album was released. The reaction was mixed. Many critics hailed it for its \\"message\\"; others derided it for being counter-culture and musical garbage. Likely many people ascribed deeper meanings to it where there were none, and missed the meaning where there was some. At the end of it all was Ian Anderson and Jethro Tull, laughing,because they knew from the beginning that all of this was their art, which has to be interpreted by each person in their own way, and one person may see something that another doesn't, which ultimately means that while there are some clearly common elements, you don't want to make too much of the meanings. They are what they are, and they may be different for you and me. Isn't great music grand?<br /><br />Note that there are numerous versions of this CD, with varying availability and price.  You should survey the versions available to determine which version best meets your needs.<br /><br />Five stars for one of the best progressive rock albums to ever be released, and for music to be intellectually stimulated by.laughing, because they knew from the beginning that all of this was their art, which has to be interpreted by each person in their own way, and one person may see something that another doesn't, which ultimately means that while there are some clearly common elements, you don't want to make too much of the meanings.

B00006DEFA|5.0|Music apart, and in so far as human behaviour is concerned; this movie describes, without a sense of annoyance, the vicious innovations of man's cunning and cleverness, consolidated mainly in the person of Antonio Salieri.   Interesting to see Salieri, in neat costumes and ingratiating in obvious feline way, set himself to captivate the emperor's attention and please `his friendly enemy' Mozart.   Perhaps the main source of competition between Mozart and Salieri was related to who would be able to win Da Ponte's librettos before the other. Of course the movie tells us that Salieri contrived to get rid of Mozart and blocked his advancement from becoming the Emperor's Kapellmeister.   Five main events are not shown in the movie:  1)Mozart's claim that Salieri tried to poison him (this was never proved).  2)The two notorious pupils Mozart taught, Beethoven and Sussmayr.  Beethoven was a great admirer of Mozart and later used him as a   model (Piano concerto No 4 - G major - and Mozart's K503 - C major - is one example)  3)In his last days Mozart composed his unfinished masterpiece (and never will) `The Requiem' that he discussed with Sussmayr (not Salieri). However there is no proof that Sussmayr was actually able to complete Mozart's Requiem.  4)In Mozart's presence Salieri was brusque and even harsh in manner to Constanze (Mozart's wife), behaving like he was the only man in the Royal Family.  5)Mozart's friendship with Hayden (They both were members of the same Masonic Lodge)    Nevertheless, this movie inspires you with so many sentiments that one feels the loss of Mozart is like the loss of one's soul.
B0002K6Z0C|5.0|It's hard for me to believe that it has been more than 20 years since this album was first released. I remember when MTV made such a big deal when the \\"Thriller\\" video was first shown, playing it to what was then and may still be the biggest audience MTV has ever had. The hype was incredible, with a \\"making of\\" video and interviews with Michael Jackson, dancers, and Vincent Price.<br /><br />\\"Thriller\\" continues to fight for the title of the biggest selling CD of all time with the Eagles' first volume of greatest hits. While the musical influence of \\"Thriller\\" has been significantly less than that of many other works, it remains an excellent collection of pop music and marks the peak of Michael Jackson's career.<br /><br />When I reviewed \\"Welcome to My Nightmare\\" by Alice Cooper, I stated that anything with Vincent Price in it is likely to be good. The title track fits that statement perfectly. Vincent Price is superb, with an incomparable laugh to help finish his monologue. Vincent Price has such a wonderful voice for speaking roles such as the one in \\"Thriller.\\" The title track is a wonderful, almost campy song. The horns and beat were perfect, middle-of-the-road pop. While the song is campy, the mildly dark elements helped mark a transition in Michael's music to darker, angrier themes.<br /><br />Another song which has some of these same dark elements is \\"Beat It.\\" The video highlighted well that this song was a theme song for the pent up emotions and frustrations of teenagers everywhere. A fast song with a theme that would readily fit into a modern version of \\"West Side Story,\\" the elements of this song made this song one of Michael's angriest songs of the time and hinted at things to come.<br /><br />As if \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Beat It\\" were preludes, the third song with dark elements in it is \\"Billie Jean.\\" While the song has an easy beat and relatively simple musical elements, the words are dark. Billie Jean is telling Michael that he is the father of her baby. Michael denies that he is the father, and further says that it was just a fling, but mostly to himself; he's not talking directly to her.  This song is a sobering song given that most of the remaining songs on this CD are love songs.<br /><br />Most of the other songs on this CD deal with women and relationships. Most were classics the instant they went onto this CD, some more so than others. The duet with Paul McCartney, \\"The Girl is Mine,\\" was recorded when Michael and Paul were the best of friends.<br /><br />The electronic instrumentation and the complex vocals of \\"Human Nature\\" were musical high points in the 80s that few others were able to approach much less match. \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\" is a musically simpler song, bordering on bubble gum, but Michael Jackson was unstoppable at this point, and the song has such a good beat that it's hard to ignore. \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something'\\" also received a lot of airplay back in the 80s.<br /><br />Many albums re-released on CD add all sorts of extras to add value to the CD.  In many cases the extra material works.  There are several versions of this CD that add a lot of extra material.  However, the extra material on those versions distract from the artistic achievement of \\"Thriller.\\"  This CD is one of the few pre-CD era albums where the album itself was so good and sufficient that extras are unnecessary.<br /><br />\\"Thriller\\" is unassailable. Even if you are usually not a Michael Jackson fan, you can appreciate the art of this music from an incredibly creative period for Michael. \\"Thriller\\" is the only Michael Jackson CD I own, and I do not play it often, but when I do, I fall into the incredible talent Michael has, and remember an era that seems to be receding all too quickly into my past.her, and further says that it was just a fling, but mostly to himself; he's not talking directly to her.

B000094HMU|5.0|Leona Mitchell is one of the very few `Sopranos' able to drive the message home, particularly in this recording.   Placido Domingo warm voice is superb although, at times, I felt the music was a bit higher than the voice. (aria Nessun Dorma - None shall sleep -was magnificent)  The duo (Liu-Calaf) \\"My Lord: Listen and Don't cry Liu) ... how could one avoid crying!!   The performance of the ministers Ping, Pong and Pang and the way they `absorbed' their roles made me feel they were playing on the original site in Beijing.

0142000663|5.0|Steinbeck's work shows us the grit, pain, tiredness, disappointment, and failure of humanity.  He did it by bringing us into a story by telling it to us.  Secondary to that he showed us the story.  Yes, he was a great story teller and he obviously had a voice of his own.  Interesting thing is his books made great movies but they still remained top sellers for decades.  \\"Grapes\\", is still up there with the best Amrican writers.<br /><br />It might take a while for some readers to get into the pace.  Steinbeck doesn't write like many of the current best sellers.  So if your expecting a drop dead crises on every page, a cliff hanger with every turn - forget it.  Steinbeck's novels pull us in and keep us there because we feel what is happening to the characters, not because we have to know what happens next.  What a master!<br /><br />Who can review Grapes of Wrath and say something new or different and still be relevant?  Not me, and not a lot of others either.  This is a five star read and I thought so decades ago when I first looked at it.  I appreciate it even more now.
0345420128|5.0|The techniques in this book may seem a little too simple...but they work! I was on day eight of my 'dream journal' when I had my first intentional lucid dream. I didn't get to fly to the moon or become one with the universe, but I did realize that I was dreaming. Unfortunately my 'Woo-Hoo' response kicked me into a waking state. Hey, it's a beginning, and with that one experience the book paid for itself. Definitely worth the price.

B000002MY3|1.0|Until a listen of this cd I never truly understood anguish, pain, and authenticity.  Morrisette is an artist of the highest caliber.  Reaching inside the depths of her soul to produce music that allows mere mortals a glimpse into the heart of genius.  Thank you Alanis for having the courage to put the struggles of growing up in suburban Ottawa as a provincial Tiffany child star into this masterpiece.  The realism of those mean streets that you survived only serve to make your art more credible.  Even the name Jagged Little Pill (and Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie too) is charged with an energy that is free from all posturing and posing.  The best that music has to offer. NOT!!!!!!!!

It gives a strong nod to Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre, so if you liked those books you may like this as well.  But the plot is not copied from those books, it's just written in a similar style.  The Thirteenth Tale will sit nicely beside my Jane Austen and Bronte sisters, and I would welcome more books by Ms. Setterfield.

B000A2H812|5.0|Gogol Bordello's latest album has two layers.  The first layer is aparent after a fitst listening, the second takes a while.  One of the first things that drew me to this band, and probably what gets most people hooked on them, was the fusion of sounds they produce.  I'm a big fan of bands like Flogging Molly, bands who manage to fuse their ethnic heritage along with good ole' punk rock.  The eastern gypsy music (as well as reggae, flamenco, and whatever else they decide to throw in) adds a fun twist on what would normally be considered simple, three-chord-or-less rock.  The music is just so fun that everytime I hear it, I want to jump around the room like I'm at some crazy wedding (note: \\"Dogs Were Barking\\" is exactly this)!  However, after I calmed down, I started listening to what Eugene Hütz was singing (some call it screaming, but screw them).  What wasn't in Hungarian (or Ukranian, I'm not very good with Eastern European languages) was very smart, politically-charged comments on culture and where one belongs.  Songs like \\"Immigrant Punk\\" and \\"Underdog World Strike\\" are near-brilliant critiques about how Americans handle culture.  Although there are some songs that are just for fun (\\"Start Wearing Purple\\" and the mostly-instrumental \\"Not A Crime\\" and \\"Mishto!\\"), this album is packed with brilliant social commentary backed, or perhaps masked, by wonderful hip-shaking musical variety.  I true pleasure to listen to!
0671646788|5.0|I recently came across the title as cited by several different people as a book that was important in their life, and I'm grateful that I did.

It is not new, and a few of the examples given will be dated. That doesn't lessen it's messages in anyway.
B000HT386M|4.0|A CHRISTMAS CAROL....ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE...CLICK.  Yes, all three have one thing in common:  they all show their heroes what their lives could have been like had they made different choices.  CLICK certainly isn't the kind of classic the other two films have become, but for entertaining its audience, CLICK manages to click.<br /><br />Adam Sandler obviously trying to hone his dramatic skills stars as Michael Newman, a workaholic whose drive for achievement is alienating him from his family.  Kate Beckinsale is his lovely wife whose patience and endurance are wearing thin.  Sean Astin is the speedoclad jock who has taken Sandler's son under his wing; David Hasselhoff is his egocentric and self-centered boss; Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner are his warmhearted youthful acting parents.  And Christopher Walken is the mysterious Morty who supplies Sandler with a remote control that can control his life.  He can fast forward past arguments, turn off the volume of his dog's barking, etc.<br /><br />The movie's first half is the expected slapstick, lowbrow humor with lots of sexual and flatulent references, and it's pretty funny; the movie segues however into a dramatic look at how things change when Sandler keeps fast forwarding past important events just so he can reach his goal to be Hasselhoff's partner.  Wonderful makeup effects by Rick Baker heighten the reality of this section of the movie, and it almost has a real bummer of an ending...almost.<br /><br />I enjoyed CLICK and was impressed with the overall performances.  Sandler is to be commended for taking artistic chances, and CLICK enables him to do so.
B000HIVO64|3.0|After living with \\"The Information\\" for two weeks, I've come to the conclusion that we are now in The Age of Beck II. Beck II is just like Beck I, except that Beck II is largely depressed, humorless and apparently convinced that slicker production can make up for a lack of enthusiasm. Does Beck still want to be a recording artist? Does the job still make him happy, or is he only going through the motions?    If, as some reviewers believe, this is Beck's \\"Scientology Album,\\" it's pretty clear the \\"church\\" isn't making him happy either. He sounds miserable here and unlike on \\"Sea Change,\\" the misery makes no point and serves no purpose. I don't think he's recovered from whatever inspired \\"Sea Change\\" even if he thinks he has. There is NO humor here, just a lot of expert, but ultimately tedious craftsmanship. On \\"1000 BPM\\" he briefly uses his hustler voice from \\"Hollywood Freaks\\" and all I could think was: \\"Man, 'Midnight Vultures' was a PARTY. This is a funeral.\\" I mean, what can you say when the most radio-ready track on the album, \\"Nausea,\\" has a message that basically comes down to: \\"Life's a bitch and then you die\\"?    There are some good moments, especially \\"Elevator Music\\" and \\"Cellphone's Dead,\\" which is the only track that really gets the hip-hop/electronica merger that is (apparently) the goal of the album. But after a few listens it's very hard to care about much else here. There is also the standout bad track \\"Strange Apparition\\" which I have to believe was recorded while being held at gunpoint by a crazed Dave Matthews fan. Never has Beck sounded less like Beck, though he comes close on the endless final track, which sounds almost exactly like William Orbit in places.    Beck I is my favorite living American recording artist; here's hoping Beck II gets a new therapist and a new producer, in that order.    Oh...and if you haven't heard \\"Guero,\\" pick up a copy immediately. Though I think Beck II also made \\"Guero,\\" under the heavy influence of the Dust Brothers he put together an album that is both sophisticated/professional-sounding and lots of fun that gets better every time you hear it. It's no \\"Odelay\\" (and despite what 10 million critics have written it doesn't sound ANYTHING like \\"Odelay\\") but it is a damn fine record.
0525948023|5.0|This guy must have been smoking plenty in order to create his lofty and interesting theories. He has developed his ideas from his first book \\"The power of now\\". It's very entertaining for a student of zen buddhism to learn about Tolle's ideas and thoughts. For a thoroughly understanding of this text you will benefit learning about zen. Steven Hagen's \\"Buddhism Plain and Simple\\" is an excellent source that strips out Buddha's teaching into it's core, without BS.
0743424425|5.0|I decided to pick this book up after watching one of my favorite movies \\"The Shining\\" by Stanley Kubrick based on this book. There are a lot of things that I found strange and unexplained in the movie and I thought 'Maybe if I read the book they will be explained.' I definitely felt that the book was able to go into much more detail, very scary, I didn't want to read it alone. There are a lot of things the book is able to describe that would not have been believable or frightening if they tried to put it into the film. There is also a lot of character description, it really builds on Jack's past with alcholism which really helps you understand his character more. It was a great book.
0393061434|5.0|I just read the book iWoz. If you are a Mac-head, or just a computer geek who is intrigued by the origins of the PC industry, this  book is definately a must-read. It gives a great, human approach to the subject of Steve Wozniak, inventor, and the people in his life who helped draw him out and create the Apple I, the computer that really signified the true arrival of small, affordable computers for the masses. The prose is written in a very informal and relaxed style, as if Steve is sitting across from you and telling you his story himself. I found it very engaging. I am a very tough critic, but this is definately a book I will read again.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It's well written, it has moments of great comedy, but still holds a really involved and meaningful plot. I think this is a movie that has a little something to offer everyone who watches it. Very pleased with it all around.
0805076476|4.0|I saw fight club on TV before I even knew it was a book, and when I started reading it I thought knowing the ending would ruin the book. But it was the complete opposite. I liked the book even more because I was able to pick on little details I would have only seen on a re-read. The movie and the book are very similar because it's a short book, so not much had to be cut out.  <br /> I would highly recommend this book, Chuck Palahniuk has an interesting writing style where he will start with the end of a chapter and then use the rest of the chapter explain how they got there. The other notable thing about Chuck's writing style is the dialogue, and how important quote marks are, people will think something while having a conversation and then move right on to saying something else and its easy to get lost with something someone said and what they thought. Other than that a great quick read that's fascinating.
B000007MVM|5.0|Syd suffered from schizophrenia. Although I have never seen it written in so many words, it seems obvious. Schizophrenics come in many shapes and sizes. Some have loose associations and switch easily from subject to subject. A common characteristic of speech in many schizophrenics is \\"clanging\\", making nonsense rhymes like \\"clang, bang, sang\\" and the like. There is a certain disorganization of thought that can make conversation with someone with this condition challenging. Often, people suffering from schizophrenia are drawn to hallucinogens, possibly because it can actually make them feel \\"normal\\". <br /> <br />I think I just described \\"The Madcap Laughs\\" in trying to describe schizophrenia. Associations are loose, rhymes are nonsensicle, flights of ideas spray scattershot around. Like \\"The Beautiful Mind\\", the line between genius and schizophrenia is murky. To see the connections that the rest of us are incapable of often takes psychopathology in some form. <br /> <br />One final thought: Did Syd lose it because of hallucinogens? I doubt it. The hints of schizophrenia often appear before the psychotic break, often starting in the late teens to early twenties. He was schizophreniform well before the drugs, as can be seen in earlier Floyd tunes. <br /> <br />PS Syd's diabetes was likely caused by his antipsychotic meds, so the cure for his genius killed him. How ironic.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|If you \\"love\\" love stories the way I do, this bittersweet tale of two people from totally different worlds will surely melt your heart (if it doesn't you better make sure it's still ticking).  Seriously, it is an excellent movie with an excellent plot and EXCELLENT performances by Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson.  They make Ester Hoffman and John Norman Howard come to life.  GET AND ENJOY!!! (please bring a box of tissues to the room your watching it in and no popcorn cause it's bound to get soggy!!!!)
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Well done compilation.  Civil War holds up and is just one of the many examples that Axl could write a lyric. \\"did you wear a black armband when they shot the man who said peace will last forever \\"  I don't need your civil war !! <br /> <br />Amazing !!
B000FTWB7G|4.0|The only song I don't like is \\"Call Me When You're Sober.\\" I almost didn't buy this CD because of that song, thinking the rest would be like that awful song (an obvious bone they threw to the radio Gods). It is completely out of place with the rest of the CD. The rest of the CD is really great. Amy's voice is in top-form. The heavier songs remind me they are still the Evanescence I know and love, and the more melancholy songs are hauntingly beautiful. There is a tremendous layering of sounds on this CD (in a good way). There is a different take than what was heard on Fallen. Every band borrows a little from somebody, and this CD has percussion and sonic effects reminiscent of Tori Amos's \\"To Venus and Back\\", and some of the bass and guitar work reminds me a lot of The Gathering's \\"How to Measure a Planet?\\" I'm a fan of both, so it doesn't bother me! This CD is an outstanding follow-up to their debut. I think if they tried to make \\"Fallen Part 2\\" they would have failed. This is one of the best CD's of the year, no doubt about it.       <br />
B0001YRVN4|5.0|These films look really good cleaned up, only thing George shouldn't of changed/added was the Greedo/Han scene in episode 4, the Han walking over Jabbas tail scene in episode 4, and the change to the end scene in episode 6 at the end where yoda, obi-wan, and anakin are all standing together smiling at luke. Replacing the old darth vader with the actor from episode 3 was just plain out dumb.
B000002IAZ|4.0|For a band who was together for such a short time they put out some classics. Who knows what they could have done, but they did produce some of the best bands to come out of the 60s and 70s. This contains the very best of what they did in two short years. All the best ones are here.
B000087DRK|5.0|Initially the lyrics are scary fun and so clever. Am I allowed to think this is funny? Of course. But they are so very non-PC... And what do they really mean by this? Then I sang \\"Don't say motherf*cker, motherf*cker\\" and \\"Rah rah rah rah rendezvous with ANUS -- ANUS!\\" about a hundred times along with Hank von Helvete and it was just words that didn't bother me to say anymore. Am I getting coarsened and stupidified?  <br /> <br />I don't care. It's really all about a cranking, rolling juggernaut of pop rock punk borrowings composted, smoked and blasted out in a totally familiar and yet inventive new format. Hormonally driven fun fun fun with unusual twisty gorgeous chord changes that are so stupidly simple and brilliant. And then Euroboy plays his fantastic riffs. This record pours power into me.
B0000089FS|5.0|seriously, it is good stuff man just get blazed and sit back and let your mind try to eat it
0880796863|3.0|In my opinion, the book was written in very vague, complex, language.  There is no way to describe the disappointment. Tarot \\"experts\\" have raved about Waite being THE guru of Tarot.  Personally, it was like reading Old English.   <br />It is so uninformative it is useless.  Many pages are dedicated to giving the history of the art of Tarot.  Waite describes the Ancient 10-card spread and the mat provided in the set is very beautifully and artistically done.  However, I have found other spreads less time consuming and equally revealing.  Most do not have an hour to dedicate to one reading and months to learn the process.  There are numerous Tarot card decks out there that are pleasing to the eye and less difficult to handle.  I wish that I had read the poor reviews this set has received.  I would have made a better choice.  I hope this is helpful and the reader will opt for another source of Tarot information and a different deck.  Save yourself a headache and keep looking.  I could not recommend this set to anyone.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|I'm not sure if I'm in the minority in this, but I think this is the best work the boys have ever done. It starts out with a great hard rocking track and just whisks you away to incredible stories and grand epics in the entire disc. I just saw them perform the entire CD live, and its incredible too. If you are a TRUE Maiden fan, I think you will LOVE THIS DISC!!!!
B0006U4UAU|4.0|Which is true, but it's even better when they make it their own and not just simply recycle the same beats over to us as if we wouldn't know.  Being heavily influenced by some of the best stuff out there, LCD Soundsystem has created a very broad album in the fact that it encompasses many different genres while still staying within one track!<br /><br />There's nothing marvelously deep or enthralling here, just some really good fun, making beats and dancing too them.  And that's how this album should be taken as.  You want to have fun and you want to dance?  Throw in some LCD!  There's nothing here you really can't groove, jam, and rock out too.  It's got it all, I wouldn't be surprised if you found these tracks playing in all kinds of different discos.<br /><br />I myself being more of a rock fan, really enjoy the friendly usability of this album.  I'm not completely ignorant on what is what when it comes to dance pop, electro, or synth pop and all that.  I have my share of albums on all sorts of genres.  And surprisingly this album will be one of them that bridges many of them.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you're into grooving, feel loose and just want to chill or have a party at your flat.  After it's over, you can put on some Daft Punk, and then they'll really be playing at your house!
B000H305U0|1.0|A heinous crime has been committed here ladies and gentlemen, and the victim is music in general, which has been completely shattered by the junk spewing out of this man's mouth.  <br /> <br />I understand perfectly well that every human being has his/her own tastes. But for the life of me I cannot understand how music like this gets popular. How a song like Sexy Back got to #1 on the charts would be a perfect case study for a large group of sociologists. This song is all special effects and zithering; if these were turned off, Justin's voice would resemble more closely the sound a certain orifice makes after consuming a three-bean salad. I remember a record producer saying once that he could make a cactus into the next popstar, and though I thought it was humorous at the time, I now realize that he really wasn't joking at all. <br /> <br />Why is it that every popstar nowadays wants to forge some sort of phony youth where they were trapped in a violent ghetto? Have these people ever been within 50 miles of a REAL ghetto? Apparently it's somehow considered heroic to have peddled drugs to children, shot, maimed, or killed others, and general behaved as a degenerate sadist (see that scumbag 50 Cent's life for a perfect example). Things that are uncool are working hard in school, saving money for your future, saying no to illicit drugs, and generally trying to make a positive contribution to society. Have we sunk so low as a society where it's cooler to have been a criminal than to have lived your life honestly and gained everything through ability, merit, and hard work?  <br /> <br />Which brings me to a wider problem; what the heck is going on with the music industry? Take one look at the local top 40 to see what I mean. There's not a single shred of artistic value in there. It's all the same garbage, copied over and over, and sold to the idiotic masses who swallow it all and make these dreadful embezzlers tons of money. It's a pitiful joke.
B00064WSNW|5.0|My first exposure to the 80's incarnation of King Crimson was in the early 80s when I bought Beat after seeing and MTV News bit about how the classic progressive rock group had defied history by maintaining the same lineup for two albums in a row.    I probably just lost a lot of you with a sentence that seems incoherent but yes, at one time MTV did acknowledge a wide variety of music.  Bear with me.    Raised on FM radio and just beginning to scratch the surface of prog rock with Rush I was thoroughly underwhelmed by King Crimson's effort which sounded poppy and more than a little like Talking Heads.    Fast forward 20 years and I had read glowing reviews of Discipline, the KC album recorded prior to Beat.  I decided to give it a listen.    I was thoroughly amazed.    Discipline is almost transcendent- it not only captured what was happening in music at that time but looked forward to what music could become as well as standing as an example of what King Crimson as a band is all about.    If you want to understand Yes, listen to Close to the Edge.  If you want to understand Rush, listen to Moving Pictures.  If you want to understand King Crimson, listen to Discipline.    When you have soaked this record in you may say to yourself, \\"I just heard  pure music- music that exists outside time.\\"    Or you may say to yourself, \\"I know why Bill Bruford left Yes to be a part of this.\\"    Or you may say to yourself, \\"I know why Robert Fripp told Bruford after Close to the Edge, 'I think you are ready for King Crimson now.'\\"    Or you may find yourself paraphrasing the words of the protagonist of Indiscipline:    I do remember one thing.  It took hours and hours but..  By the time I was done with it,  I was so involved, I didnt know what to think.  I carried it around with me for days and days..  Playing little games  Like not listening to it for a whole day  And then... listening to it.  To see if I still liked it.  I did.    In short, this album is King Crimson at their finest: less a band than a laboratory to create music that defies definition as it hits you on the intellectual, emotional and visceral levels.    Buy it.
0446677450|1.0|I found his advises similar with what I knew since my childhood (save money, invest to bring you more money, don't spend much, real estate is good, etc). It does not give tips on what \\"rich\\" people know (at least I suspect they would know more). Like how and where to get valuable information. How to buy stocks, what to look for, nothing of that. May be inspirational book for some, a poor kid who became rich... Tells 100 times the same things, annoying at some point. <br />The good part is that it encourages you to save and invest, by saying it over and over again... But that you know, right? Otherwise you would not look on Amazon to buy this book... :) <br /> <br />Maybe a 1-2 stars, gave 1 because it is too highly rated.

B000HBK3MM|3.0|I purchased this CD on the strength of \\"Put Your Records On\\", which is my pick me up song at the moment. Inspiring. Fun. Positive.  I didn't know what to expect from the rest of the CD. Well, it's inspiring, fun and positive. It's enjoyable. I can put this record on (pun intended) and it's great mood music.  I love her voice...I must say that I don't play this as much as my Amos Lee CD \\"Supply and Demand\\", but I am reminded of just how good this CD is whenever I pop it in my CD player.  I'm looking for and expecting great things from this artist. \\"Call Me When You Get This\\" and \\"Till It Happens To You\\" are 2 of my favorites. Buy this one if you are looking for a unique sound..a stand out.
B00000IMTF|5.0|But, unfortunately I can only give it five. This album is a classic, right up there with Machine Head. \\"Tarot Woman\\" is an awesome opener. \\"Run With the Wolf\\" rocks along and is one of those songs that just gets stuck in your head. \\"Starstruck\\" is pretty good too. \\"Do You Close Your Eyes\\" isn't quite as good as the rest of the album, but excellent none the less. The real highlight of the album is \\"Stargazer.\\" Wow. Wow. WOW. It left me stunned and speechless the first time I heard it. An epic in its own right. \\"A Light in the Black\\" is a great finisher for Rainbow's best album. Long Live Rock and Roll is a close second to this one. Rising is an essential must-have in any rock collection, especially for Deep Purple fans and people who don't own it. Verdict: Buy two.
1881273156|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone whether dating or married. This book looks at love from a different yet inspiring perspective.

0792844793|4.0|This movie glues you to your seat through out its play time; but only for the first time. Its not for repeated viewing.  I bought this movie because i found it in the \\"top 100 hollywood movies\\" list. I don't think i am going to watch it again for another year.The movie is good but its overrated. So rent it and enjoy it and get rid of the Blue Velvet. I also bought this movie because i heard lot about \\"the weiredest\\" Dennis Hopper, but i think thats his normal state and does what he always do - GOES CRAZY.
1401302378|3.0|The big thing these days seems to be science writers like Malcolm Gladwell coming up with best-sellers that, charitably put, are very light on facts and very long on sometimes outlandish assertion. Chris Anderson, editor in chief of Wired magazine, joins the parade with his silly - yes, silly - claim that businesses like music and movies are no longer driven by hits, but by the \\"long tail.\\" That it is the thousands of titles that people buy or rent infrequently. Somehow, according to Anderson, the idea of web merchants making a zillion titles available and some of those titles being sold or rented once or twice will be the \\"transformation . . . coming to just about every industry imaginable.\\" Uh, no it ain't. Nowhere in the book does Anderson factor in the reality that someone pays for the production of all those videos and music tracks that rent or sell infrequently. Nor does he account for the reality that not every web merchant can acheive the volume of an Amazon or eBay. In other words, Anderson has discovered the obvious: if you make 30,000 movies available for rental, let's say, through a Netflix, many of the cult titles and dogs will be rented. Anderson pounds on this \\"long tail\\" effec while glossing over the fact that the neighborhood video rental store won't carry 30,000 titles. The profits from the occasionl rental of the 30,000th item on the list won't match the cost of acquiring and keeping it in stock in a store, while it makes little difference to a Netflix.<br /><br />  Anderson also plays fast and loose with his facts. In fact, Anderson sometimes simply omits facts that might undermine his argument. Lee Gomes, of The Wall St. Journal, did some homework and discovered that \\"By Mr. Anderson's calculation, 25% of Amazon's sales are from its tail, as they involve books you can't find at a traditional retailer. But using another analysis of those numbers -- an analysis that Mr. Anderson argues isn't meaningful -- you can show that 2.7% of Amazon's titles produce a whopping 75% of its revenues. Not quite as impressive.\\" Thus the traditional retail store's emphasis on big movers is smart merchandising.<br /><br />  Overall, this is just another over-hyped pseudo-science book that takes a very narrow view based on few facts, ignores any embarassing discrepancies and proclaims itself as an earth-shattering discovery. For those who are aware of how statistical data can be manipulated, this is indeed a very humorous book. For marketers, however, it is an essentially useless tome. Anderson's enthusiastic, breezy style, even though it is ultimtely ill-informed and almost dishonest, does make for interesting reading. Just don't take what's here too seriously.<br /><br />Jerryles produce a whopping 75% of its revenues.

1400034779|3.0|I have to admit that I didn't really expect to like this book (or the others in the series).  This is the type of book that reviewers describe as `delightful' and `charming' and `wonderfully witty'.  I usually prefer crime fiction that is `gritty,' and `violent,' and brimming with `dark twisted humor'.  But I have come to appreciate the simple pleasure of the Number 1 Ladies Detective Agency.<br /><br />These books are classified as mysteries which can be a problem if the reader is expecting to read an actual mystery.  This novel does include a fair amount of detection (not much mystery and very little violence) however later novels in this series appear to abandon crime solving altogether, focusing instead on the everyday lives of the central characters.<br /><br />These novels are a pleasure to read and are certain to make you smile, but they lack substance.  This particular novel reads like a series of short stories strewn together.  Mma Romotswe solves her first cases quickly with the exception of the principle case in the novel (concerning a kidnapped boy), a case that she works on intermittently thoughout the novel.  Mma Romotswe makes some huge leaps in logic to solve this case.  The thin bit of evidence she does find (by luck rather than deduction) leads her to a man who may have kidnapped the boy but in the end it turns out that the evidence wasn't connected to the crime at all, making Mma Romotswe's deductive reasoning something of a fluke.<br /><br />Of course, this novel (and the others in the series) aren't really about solving crimes.  They are about life in Botswana and the lives of the people in Mma Romotswe's life.  Smith tells a story that is charming without being overly sentimental.  This novel may not be dark and twisted, but it isn't syrupy sweet either.  Personally, I could have done without the chapters focusing on Mma Romotswe's daddy and his life in the diamond mines, which felt like it belonged in a separate book, but all in all, these novels (and this one in particular) are simple pleasures to be enjoyed., these novels (and this one in particular) are simple pleasures to be enjoyed. <br />
0525476881|5.0|John Green has done it again! An Abundance of Katherines is lighter than Looking for Alaska, but the characters are just as engaging and the action, in some ways, more believable.  <br /> <br />Colin, the lovelorn prodigy; Hassan, the chubby, devoutly Muslim but also devoutly modern and lazy sidekick; and Lindsey, keeper of Archduke Franz Ferdinand's grave and heir to the local tampon-string factory/dynasty--they're all the kind of characters you can't get enough of. And the humor is the kind that will make you laugh out loud in the middle of the library and have to apologize to the librarians and the guy next to you who is researching the effect of a burgeoning cetarian-based economy on the Federalist/Anti-Federalist debates of the late 1700s and would not read a young adult novel if his tenure depended on it. <br /> <br />One thing, though--this book is as good a \\"roadtrip/buddy movie/high school males bonding\\" book as I've read in a long time.  So why does the cover scream \\"chick lit?\\"  Note to publisher: get new marketing department.  Note to male readers: ignore the cover and buy the book.

B000001FV1|5.0|1973's Shootout at the Fantasy Factory was Traffic's follow-up to 1971's excellent and classic Low Spark of High Heelded Boys.  While Shootout is not nearly as well known as a Traffic album, it's still an excellent disc.  Only 5 songs on here, but they are all great! <br /> <br />The album opens up with the storming title cut, which has fuzzed out multi-tracked guitars from Steve Winwood over a cookin' groove from the rhythm section of David Hood, Roger Hawkins, Rebop, and Jim Capaldi.  The centerpiece of the album has to be the next track, the 14 minute Roll Right Stones, which has some truly excellent chord changes along with great singing from Winwood to go along with his piano and organ playing.  Evening Blue is a plaintive ballad driven by acoustic guitar that's very pretty.  Chris Wood's Tragic Magic is a jazzy, funky instrumental showcasing his stellar ability on woodwinds.  And the closing track, Sometimes I Feel So Uninspired, is a slow burner that is actually pretty uplifting given the rather dour tone of the title.   <br /> <br />All in all a fantastic album and if you're a fan of Traffic's \\"classic\\" albums (Mr. Fantasty, Traffic, John Barleycorn Must Die, Low Spark) then this is one you should definitely check out.
0679745203|4.0|This is one of the most beautifully-written novels that I've ever read. The characters are interesting and you feel for all of them, whether you intially like them or not. It's probably better than the film and the descriptions and prose certainly top the movie's visuals, as good as they are. The only problem with the novel is the conclusion. The finale feels rushed, incomplete and just strange. It doesn't really fit with the rest of the novel and is quite jarring.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|\\"Cry Baby\\" is the coolest movie since Grease that deals with this time period. The songs are good and the actors in the film are really excellent. I'm a fan of Johnny Depp, and he came through in this movie and him in a lead role set in the 50s worked! This movie is not only a movie that takes place in the 50s, but it feels like a movie that was made in that decade as well. Everything that was big in the movies during that time are seen and used in here. I really enjoyed how this film also dealt with issues people had then and the way people acted and thought.<br /><br />I also love the music, classic Doo Wop. So if you love movies like Grease, then you need to see this movie. It's not entirely a musical like Grease was, but it still has a few songs in it. But to hear music from this time makes this movie even more real.
B000HCO83Q|1.0|If you're expecting the magic you saw in the first two movies, pass on this one and save yourself some money. <br /> <br />This movie is a total dissappointment for fans or anyone who has seen and enjoyed the first two movies.  The plot is dumb, character development for dozens of new mutants is completely absent, and it's a complete special effects blur with no imagination. Prime example, a new mutant whos \\"special power\\" is puking black ooze on his victims...(sort of like some people I knew in college who drank too much Yagermeister)? <br /> <br />Bottom line: I wish I'd never seen or purchased this movie.
B00005JNQA|4.0|The Interpreter, I thought, was a very interesting story about assasination plots within the U.N. and whehter or not people can believe the threat as true. Nicole Kidman gave a great performance as the lead character in this movie. It's not flat acting seen, but just the personality of the character who is very stressed out at this point of the movie. Sean Penn also did a great job as the agent trying to figure out the truth. It being filmed in the U.N. makes this film really unique and realistic, especially with the protestors outside that add an extra touch to this film. Overall, this movie is worth seeing. It may not be the greatest movie created, but it is still a very interesting one if you like good drama and stories about the government.
038560940X|3.0|I Just finished this book after a 3 day marathon read. I bought it on a whim after readng the jacket, which had no synopsis. I found that I was slightly put off by the fact that this was a Holocaust novel written from the perspective of a child. I eventually got over that and got sucked into the story. It is a very easy read, sometimes TOO easy considering the subject matter. Overall this book was very well written. It approaches a very difficult subject with compassion and sensitivity. My only caution... do not read this book if you're looking for an in depth Holocaust story.
B000GY729M|3.0|Definitely not as catchy as Hot Fuss but so different, it makes you want to listen. Not so sure why Flowers pretends he can't sing because you can tell he's got a great voice...he just chooses not to use it very well.  <br /> <br />Musically, it's a bit confusing - a bit of a mess, really. That being said, I do like all the strings they use. And there are also some good, groovy, transporting moments - ones you wish they'd have delivered on more fully. But they make this album worthy of a listen all the same. These guys are great musicians. <br /> <br />P.S. Those that likened them to U2... nice try, but no.
0618680004|5.0|Just finished reading The God Delusion and thought the book is wonderful reading.  Some of the science/probability speak at the first part of the book required double reading but as I stayed with the book it became better and better.  He is a formidable intellect and an eloquent writer - not to mention very funny in places (the peerless stinker).  Dawkins appears to be one of the head honchos in the atheist's \\"think tank\\" so to speak.  I would also recommend Sam Harris' book Letter to a Christian Nation.  Harris' arguments are extremely compelling and he writes in a very accessible language.  Dawkins writing is more on the literary and scientific side.  Both are great books. <br /> <br />Am surprised at the negative reviews and suspect that old adage that \\"emotion is the enemy of logic\\" and that many are clouded by their own feelings about religion and hurt by this criticism \\"The more you defend yourself, the more guilty you become.\\"  Nonetheless, I strongly recommend Richard Dawkin's British TV documentary The Root of All Evil - a fantastic documentary that every thinking person should see.
B00065JTBA|5.0|This is such a great box set with four discs that at first take sometime to get used to, but once you do, they're very addictive.  I workout to these CD's all the time for the last year and haven't got sick of them.  I listen to it in my car as well to get my mind off of LA traffic!    You won't get this music with new CD's and if you own all their studio albums and enjoy them, this is the perfect addition because, one can easily get sick of a studio album, but this is four discs and a dvd.. It's 14 months later and I'm still listening to it almost daily.    A definite for any true Bon Jovi fan, it captures the Bon Jovi spirit throughout the last 20 years so well with some songs that surprisingly did not make it on their released albums.      Lots of strong songs and it is very hard to believe than many of them didn't make onto the studio albums.    I have so many favorites on this box set (you can listen to the amazon samples):  Letter to a friend from CD-4 Uplifting classic Bon Jovi style  Nobody's Hero CD-4  Acoustic  Satellite CD-3  Garageland CD-2  Starting all over again CD-2  Radio Saved My Life Tonight CD-1 Became so popular that Bon Jovi regularly plays it live in their concerts  Open All Night CD-1 - Quinessential Bon Jovi goodness here     I saw Bon Jovi live in Los Angeles and I became a greater fan.  Best live band I've ever seen.    Once Bon Jovi was asked how do they define their music, they said:   \\"three minutes of optimism\\".  This is what their music is all about and you feel that coming through every song.  It lifts me up even when I'm down and out.
B000000W5L|4.0|I too am mystified by all the hype about this being one of the greatest albums of all time. It's very good and it rocks in spots, but it sounds like it was recorded in a cheap mobile home with a small tape recorder. This album features however more of a versatile look at the Stones as they cover not only rock but blues, soul, reggae and pop in many different styles. If you love the Stones, they can do no wrong. I really like them, but overall I don't think there as many memorable songs as their other albums and the sound seems tinnier than their previous albums. But this newest remastering on their newer CD sounds punchier and bolder than ever before.
0060760710|5.0|We LOVE this CD set!  I bought it 2 years ago for my daughter to listen to for naps and bedtime, and now at age 5 she's STILL asking for it every night. <br /> <br />I like the fact that both CDs are over an hour long, she likes that there are several stories on each CD to keep her attention.  The plots aren't too complicated for her to follow, but they do force her to pay attention and focus on the cd, which is key for naptime. :)  Stephen Fry's voice is wonderfully soothing to listen to, and he does a great job of distinguishing between the various characters -- key for books on CD!   <br /> <br />As she's gotten older Caroline has begun to appreciate some of the silliness that is Paddington, but the stories are nicely entertaining even without that element.  We parents don't mind listening to Paddington in the car when we're on trips.  All in all, I say this CD set is well worth this money, it's one that will really grow with you!!
B000002OX7|5.0|For someone like myself who was born in '72 (just a year after this album came out), let me say this: these guys really knew how to BOTH whoop it up and rock on, which are just two of the reasons why I LOVE THIS ALBUM.   Not to mention (sorry, no offense to any of you die-hard rockers out there), but the Who can also really improvise non-stop, and at the same time, whoop the pants off the Beatles and Stones, which for me, personally, makes this album an absolute must-have (not that I have anything personal against those two, for that matter.)  I just cannot help think the music on this CD is, without a doubt, WAY MUCH MORE PHENOMENAL.  =-)
B000EHRVP6|1.0|What rubbish.  I'd been looking forward to watching it (everyone said I should and that I'd like it) for such a long time and finally got to see it today and a)I wasn't even scared, b)it was stupid and c)it was time wasting (I could go on and on but I won't). <br />If you enjoy watching people getting their fingers and eyes cut out and off, then you'll probably enjoy this.  There is not one good thing to say about this movie and I'm sorry for that.  I had high expectations but this didn't deliver.  Don't waste your time on this junk. <br />
1594481938|5.0|Four very different, yet incredibly similar, people meet on New Year's Eve while attempting to commit suicide by jumping off a skyscraper in this novel that could easily have been titled As I Laying Living. Like Faulkner's work, this novel is modernist, existential, complicated, and emotionally powerful as it exams mortality. Nick Hornby is an amazing author, and this novel is probably just as good as his masterpiece About a Boy. He has an amazing ability to capture so many different, true, and poetical voices around a nearly surrealistic experience, creating a startling truth I rarely read from any other author. Hornby's books are deeply moving (both incredibly humorous and deeply sad) because (paradoxically) they have a quality of rejecting any form of predictability, sentimentality, or sappiness. This book is a beautifully perfect example of Hornby's ability. Ironically, through showing despair, he is able to show a passionate love for life. It's perfectly not unrealistic. The problems are not wiped away; there's no simple or perfect solutions and happy endings. And because of that, the novel is more beautiful and powerful, and life seems much more wonderful. Grade: A
B00005JPBP|5.0|With Christopher Nolan directing, the acting skills of Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Hugh Jackman, David Bowie (yes, the singer), and the lovely Scarlett Johansson, you can't go wrong. Even Gollum (Andy Serkis) himself shows up. Not to mention the outstanding sets, costumes, plot, and dialogue throughout the picture. While I did like The Illusionist, The Prestige has it beat in every category but the musical score. The whole theater I saw it with seemed very happy when the movie was over. They didn't stop saying \\"WOW\\" every couple of minutes towards the end of the film. The twists keep coming. If you haven't seen this film yet, get going as soon as you finish this sentence.
B000FFJYCU|3.0|GRAND PRIX is really a simple story.  American racecar driver Pete Aron lets ego get in the way of team driving and causes a wreck with his partner's car, subsequently sending his partner, Scott Stoddard to the hospital.  Aron has to find another car manufacturer to race for and does, a Japanese businessman who is convinced Aron is going to be the winner he needs.  Meanwhile, Stoddard's wife, Pat, leaves him because she can't deal with all the risk her husband is taking, but she takes up with Pete.  French champion, Sarti, gets involved with an American woman who's writing magazine pieces on the sport.<br /><br />John Frankenheimer created a unique look and feel for GRAND PRIX when he did the movie back in 1966.  One of his later movies, RONIN, starring Robert De Niro, used a lot of the same fast-paced action.  James Garner (MAVERICK, THE ROCKFORD FILES) stars along with a cast of international stars and Grand Prix racers.<br /><br />Although the movie still seems to be hailed by a lot of race enthusiasts, when you watch it as a movie and not an homage, it's three hours long and you start to become conscious of the chair because there's no deep emotional commitment on part of any of the characters.  Still, the movie tends to draw the viewer in hypnotically, moving quickly from scene to scene with plenty of local color and character changes.  It's very watchable.<br /><br />GRAND PRIX is definitely for the Formula One race fans, and a chance for a serious film student to step back 40 years and watch a master at work. James Garner fans will want to pick this one up as well because Pete Aron is an iconic Garner-type hero.
B00005UEAR|5.0|Concept album or not (I've read both sides), this is simply an amazing piece of work.  The title track is so freaking deep that I had to read the DTFAQ to even remotely appreciate it.  Another underrated track is \\"The Great Debate.\\"  These guys simply don't make an average album.  This band is amazing and this may well be their best work.  Of course, you could probably write that about any of its albums.
0618680004|4.0|As in books of this sort, I, as an atheist, agree with the precepts, and would think that others would correctly and logically arrive at similar conclusions. However, my wife, a born-again christian, discounts the same arguments. There is no logic and qualitative or rational thought to one who has accepted the god/religion stance. Why debate? Is anyone's mind ever changed on this subject? No. I almost feel it is genetic! Really.
B000002PCS|5.0|this is a timeless piece...a timeless love...at a point in their live's that was timeless....amust see for alll, especially the romantic at heart.
B000AWYOGE|5.0|I finally got around to watching this movie and was quite pleasantly surprised. Yes, it's not really all that scary, but to equate it to such drivel as Ring 2 is absurd. The acting is excellent, and the sound, score and cinematography provide the perfect atmosphere for this psychological \\"thriller.\\" As a psychological study I think it succeeds brilliantly, despite the lack of heart-stopping frights. If you watch the bonus features, you will learn what the creators intended, and I think they were spot on. I really enjoyed this film.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|Keanu and Bullock, together again... This time it's a romance with a time travel-ish twist: the couple fall in love through correspondence only, and they then realize that they are offset from each other in time by two years. It's the first film in a little while that's made me want to read Jane Austen: Persuasion, in this case. Both characters carry the film well, and they continue to have great chemistry together. The storyline could have fumbled under the weight of its Macguffin, but didn't. Of course, I have a weakness for time-travel type stories, but this film was definitely enjoyable.
B00005JPB4|4.0|Majestic and gripping, the key battle scenes of Iwo Jima bring it all back home the horrors of heroism.  Unsanitized, we get the true grit of unselfish men like Hank Hansen (Paul Walker), Mike Strank (Barry Pepper), and Ralph \\"Iggy\\" Igorski (Jamie Bell). 'Flags of Our Fathers' does a great job of showing the sweep and precariousnous of American forces capturing the famous desolate island in the Pacific.  Interspersed are scenes glorifying the men who were in the famous picture, capturing the turning moment when the American flag was unfurled on the top of Iwo Jima.      Ira Hayes (Beach), Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford), and John \\"Doc\\" Bradley (Ryan Phillippe) stand in front of multitudes and smile, giving words of encouragement for people to buy war bonds to help win the war.  They reluctantly take credit for the brave flag raising because it is expediant, they are  ordered to, and they are in the famous second flag raising that became the center of the historic picture.  Their dilemma is understandable.  Everyone feels uncomfortable at a cocktail party when one receives a compliment in front of others that one feels one doesn't deserve.  Multiplied by exponents, you understand their disposition.  Gagnon steps up to the plate and means it when he tells the multitudes that the dead men they left behind are the real heroes.  Everyone takes this as modest words, and their military promoter, who needs them to fit the bill, won't have it any other way.  We see that other men who showed more military guts went up to plant the flag, and many of them were killed.  Hayes, Bradley, and Gagnon replaced the flag when a politician demanded to get the first raised flag as a symbolic prize.  Near the end of the movie, one of the elder \\"Doc\\" states that heroes are created because we need them.  While many of the men like Sgt. Strank laid down their lives for others, everyone contributed to the impossible.  The featured three men were casualties of their reputations and the shadow ofthe contributions others made, especially the Native American, Ira, who went back to the war front.  All three men had a different fate, but the hurt of the secrets remained.      'Flags of Our Fathers' is a magnificent film, but it spends too long trying to define heroes and dwelling on the dilemma of heroes who lived sincerely to promote a good cause:   Fighting to defeat tyranny at war with allegedly smaller contributions and with fundraisers at home.  It is good to hear and see the true story in all its ramifications, but after all is said in done, they are all heroes for heeding their nation's call when freedom itself was in danger of extinction.  The first actual flag raising electrified the troops and brought their morale up to a real victory.  The photograph changed the morale of the nation and still retained the truth it was meant to elicit.  It was a self-fulfilling prophecy, even if it was shaky on the details.  Great performances are given all around, and the dynamic duo, Clint Eastwood and Paul Haggis ('Million Dollar Baby,' director and writer, respectively) deliver another hallmark movie.
B000J103PC|4.0|I've been to and fro on Northwest so often recently, that I'm running out of movies to watch while in transit. So, I had been avoiding watching this film, until this most recent trip. I was pleasantly surprised...it wasn't as bad as I thought it might be. The film centers on two characters, played by Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep. MS does a fantasic job of playing the editor of a fashion magazine similar to Vogue, who is very much the dragon lady you might expect. AH does a great job of playing a young graduating journalist who falls into the fashion world as MS's assistant, and suffers accordingly, but then goes through a transformation that she doesn't really understand is going on at first, and then later is very unhappy with. I was expecting vacuous, but this film wasn't that.
1416524800|5.0|I am yes one of those fans of Da Vinci Code who was just dying to read something else by Dan Brown. First, naturally I turned to Angels and Demons which was very impressive and encouraged me to find another one of his novels. I worried how well his stories would be without Robert Langdon in them from A and D and Da Vinci- but this novel surprised me.<br /><br />It actually is quite strong like the other two, and keeps you as always guessing and searching for the answers; keeping you pretty much at the edge of your seat. I myself actually thought another character was behind the deceit done in this novel (I won't give anything away) but I was plain wrong- that is the mark of a good mystery. The ending for me was not obvious and the plot was carried out in an thrilling way. The characters as well were quite strong and memorable and I definitely found myself caring about certain people in this novel and how they would end up.<br /><br />The only thing is that this is not his most exciting story he has written to me. Da Vinci's and Angels and Demons' plots were more exciting- but some may love this plot a lot more than Da Vinci- it's different for everyone. Deception Point was nonetheless interesting and, as said, always kept me guessing and thus not being able to put the book down.<br /><br />All in all Deception Point is a very well- written, entertaining read. Dan Brown did it again.<br /><br />4.5/5

0553381407|2.0|As a counseling psychologist, I read this book hoping to better understand the nature of this issue. I think Dr. Forward has a greal deal of experience and knowledge about the subject, and there are some helpful sections in her book. I feel, however, that the tone and way in which she delivers her information comes across as self-promoting, at best, and is presumptious and harmful, at worst. Through the vignettes and therapeutic dialogues, Dr. Forward paints herself as an expert who knows what people should think, react, and behave regarding this matter. I am concerned for the general public because Dr. Forward is so absolute and dogmatic about how people should approach this situation and \\"heal.\\" At no point in her book does she qualify her statements or advice, which I feel should have been addressed. While the advice in the book may help many people, I would like readers to know that she does not take into account cultural, ethnic/racial, social, economic, or other personal differences that could influence how you perceive, respond, and relate to \\"toxic parents.\\"
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|This comeback CD is simply incredible.  The arrangements are new, imaginative and a break away from the Eagles standard sound without sacrificing the spirit of their older style.  The musicianship is suberb and the new arrangements are so fresh and yet oh so familiar.<br /><br />When bands do a comeback, they often resort to cliche playing and rest on their past popularity.  In this DVD, the Eagles maintain all that was best about their past and take it to a new level of mature musicianship.<br /><br />This DVD brought back a lot of great memories and dazzled me with briliant musicianship.  I played in my own band for 11 years and I really appreciate everything that is offered here.
B00005JLEU|5.0|There are so many great movies bye hayao miyazaki but this is one of my favorites.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I am a HUGE Eagles fan and musician.  I own most of the Eagles albums and a couple of thier videos.  As a musician, I have a critical ear and I must say that this concert ranks with the very best of what they have done.  In this DVD you get thirty songs all done with extreme attention to detail.  The arrangements are phenomenal and the musicianship is top notch.  For the money, this concert is a steal and a must have for any Eagles fan.
B0000CBHOI|1.0|Scorcese is not your guy. This review covers disk one only. Scorcese is a great director no doubt. He's also presented some fantastic clips from the period. But his understanding of the blues is so warped by the search for authentic African origins that you have to wonder whether he's ever read anything about the subject. An unintentionally hilarious classic of clueless romanticism. Reminded me of another Italian-American director's tribute to the cult of phony authenticity, the Corleone village scenes in Godfather I and II.
B000HBKCDC|4.0|Great CD. However, I can only give it 4 stars as Diana Krall doesn't sing on the final track only plays the piano.
B000GIXEIG|1.0|Being bored and offended at the same time is hard to manage - but this film manages.  It is lacking in story lines and acting and I would advise anyone not to waste money buying it.  If you want to wait and rent it, then you will have invested less.  Just make sure to get another film to watch after you get bored and quit with this one.
B000002H72|5.0|I LOVE this cd! It is everything music should be.<br /><br />All of the emotions, textures and hooks are there. There is something for everyone. There are pretty songs, melodic ones, surf tunes, ugly bombastic stuff and riveting rythmic stuff. It's got it all baby!<br /><br />The Pixies, unintentionally,  started alternative music. They did not try to emulate any type of music. They just played from the heart with contributions from everybody. The drummer POUNDED away at the skins, the female bassist played rudimentary riffs that were mixed right up front yet she sang like an innocent school girl, the singer sang nice but also screeched his guts out and the guitar player made his Les Paul scream in a variety of different ways. They all contrubuted and each bandmate was indispensable.<br /><br />Standout tunes are<br /><br />\\"Here comes your man\\" a bubblegum tune so catchy it could have been featured on 1970's Am radio,<br /><br />\\"Debaser\\" a bizzare opening track that lest you know that you will not be in for a smooth ride(I love how Frank Black just slurrs the lyrics),<br /><br />\\"I bleed\\" a funky, dance dub song,<br /><br />\\"La La Love\\" a pretty yet strange ode to affection<br /><br />and my favorite \\"Number 13\\" which sounds like a blue print for the soft/hard style that Kurt Cobain perfected with Nirvana.<br /><br />I write a lot of reviews and rarely give 5 stars because not all cds can be perfect. This cd is! It does not hit you right away but rather it needs to sink in. This, back in the day, was art and the Pixies hit a bullseye.
B000002U9W|5.0|Released in 1970, this excellent album showed the band developing the symphonic approach to their music that they started exploring on A Saucerful of Secrets (1968) and brought to its fullest expression on Wish you Were Here (1975).  However, the experimental tendencies that characterized their music of the 1960's were also present too, albeit in the form of found sounds rather than bizarre effects generated on the electric guitar and other electronic manipulations.<br /><br />The lineup at this point is the classic incarnation of Pink Floyd and included Roger Waters (bass, vocals); David Gilmour (electric/acoustic guitars, vocals); Rick Wright (Hammond organ, piano, mellotron); and Nick Mason (drums). Joining the band for the first time however, was a choir and a full symphony orchestra (including a ten piece brass ensemble) that was initially directed by Ron Geesin (who would also collaborate with Roger on The Body - 1970).  Ron however, cracked under the pressure and the orchestra was eventually directed by John Aldiss.  Syd fans may want to take note of the fact that he (Syd Barrett) apparently wandered into the studio during the recording sessions.<br /><br />The nearly 24 minute multimovement suite Atom Heart Mother is one of my favorite lengthy compositions by Pink Floyd (along with Echoes and Shine on you Crazy Diamond).  This is a fantastic work that opens with a plodding gloomy theme that Dave referred to as a \\"theme from an imaginary western\\".  The addition of an orchestra; loads of brass and the choir add quite a lot to its epic, sweeping grandeur.  Although the band members have been quoted as saying that they did not care for this track that much, I think it is just fantastic.  The other \\"half\\" of this album (I used to own this on vinyl) consists of Roger's pastoral, acoustic track If, with great spacey Hammond work from Rick; Rick's adventurous piano-led Summer 68', which (somewhat) restates themes from Atom Heart Mother, complete with the brass sections; Dave's soft acoustic and spacey piece Fat Old Sun; and finally, the other epic on the album Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast (13'00\\").  This last composition is a collage of found sounds encountered in the kitchen while making breakfast (dripping water, a match being struck, frying food etc) that are alternated with loosely played sections by the band.  Again, this was another piece that the band did not care for every much, indicating that it was more or less \\"thrown together\\", but something that I like very much.<br /><br />The reissued CD is actually very nice and features a re-designed booklet by none other than Storm Thorgerson along with the original lyrics.<br /><br />This album is significant in that the elements of the classic Pink Floyd sound were finally in place.  Very highly recommended along with Meddle (1971).  Before I forget, The Amazing Pudding was the original working title for Atom Heart Mother.acoustic and spacey piece Fat Old Sun; and finally, the other epic on the album Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast (13'00\\").

B00000D9TQ|5.0|I have never wrote a review but i felt compelled to do so on this album. I am only 23 years old, but i remember every single one of these, from listening to the radio in my dads truck. If you want a blast from the past, and awesome music too boot, THIS IS THE CD!
0345323882|4.0|This book was quite entertaining and it helped me to understand what caused the films \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"Total Recall\\" to come about. Because of this historicity*, it is a must-read. <br /> <br />Otherwise, I didn't buy the idea that all insect and small-animal life on planet Earth could ever be destroyed by a nuclear war, especially when humans were left alive to walk around in the radioactive dust. I was especially disappointed with the final scene, when the hero comes home and his wife admiringly watches him lay down to sleep without first showering off the caked dust that was all over him. <br /> <br />*I started to use the word Historicity after reading the author's other book \\"The Man in the High Castle\\" which is about San Francisco in a world where the Germans and Japanese won WW2 (Dick has a penchant for San Francisco).
B000HCO840|3.0|My rating doesn't go for the movie, it was really good, 4-5 stars for x-men fans (other than it doesn't follow the real x-men story). But there's not much reason to but this special edition. the only difference between this and the non-special edition one is that this one comes with a comic that has stan lee's five favorites. the dvd has no other special features, it is actually the same as the non-special edition, just in a bigger cardboard sleeve.
B000EBEHR2|1.0|Perhaps i'm just a jaded, long-time fan of Placebo but this album is basically a catchier version of \\"Without You I'm Nothing\\" with the electronic influence of \\"Black Market Music\\" and \\"Sleeping With Ghosts.\\"  Placebo has always written catchy pop songs, but at least with \\"BMM\\" and \\"SWG\\" you could tell that Placebo was trying to experiment with their sound and evolve.  That is no longer the case here.  This is Placebo at their most formulaic and predictable.  You can easily guess the tempo changes during and between songs and I often guessed the lyrics three lines in advance during the latter half of the album.  There is that little variety in lyrical and musical content.  They seem resigned to write simple, catchy, easily marketable pop songs that make it easy for DJs to remix for nightclubs.  What's worse is that this album might have at least been listenable if the lyrics hadn't been so horrible and corny.  With this album they've become a dark, broody version of the Backstreet Boys.  Who cares if they can play their own instruments if they are simply rehashing themselves?  They've obviously gone as far as they can possibly go as a band and if they had stopped with \\"WYIN\\" I would still be able to respect them.   Not that \\"BMM\\" and \\"SWG\\" are bad albums, but \\"WYIN\\" is obviously their best effort.
B00005JOYM|2.0|While I was on the edge of my seat when I saw \\"United 93,\\" I kid you not--I nodded off half-way through \\"World Trade Center.\\"  It was that boring.  I could not get into the characters due to lack of development.  This was not the type of movie I was expecting.  Who would've thought Nicolas Cage would be under rubble for 3/4 of the movie?  One minute he's waking up.  Then he's in the police station.  And finally he's being knocked down by rubble in the World Trade Center.  I thought this movie was going to show you the chaos of what it was like to be in the World Trade Center that horrific day.  And how the police officers like Cage risked their lives to bring some order into the chaos.  Instead the action in the World Trade Center happened so quickly--it seemed more like a movie about what happens after an earthquake than anything else.  Because Cage is under rubble for 3/4 of the movie, there was nothing else Stone could show except the police officers' families.  This showed how sterile Hollywood has gotten.  The family stories were more like something you would see in a made-for-TV movie.  I momentarily woke up from my snooze and saw a little boy climb into the family car against his mother's wishes because he feels it may be the last time he'll see his father.  This is a perfect example of a cliche.  After I saw this movie, I mentioned to the people I saw this movie with how I longed for the daring and innovative films from the '70s.  Today the movies have gotten so commercialized.  Even the independent films have gotten jaded.  For an indie film to do well--it has to either be about violence (\\"Pulp Fiction\\"), sex (\\"Brokeback Mountain\\") or a dysfunctional family (\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\").  Nothing new under the sun.  Quick.  What was the Best Picture last year?  In 1972 it was \\"The Godfather.\\"  In 1974, it was \\"The Godfather, Part II.\\"  In 1977 it was \\"Annie Hall.\\"  Who will remember the Best Picture winners for this decade?
B00005JPBP|5.0|Never has the world of illusion been as cleverly portrayed as it is in Christopher Nolan's \\"The Prestige.\\" Much like a real magic show, it's filled with enough twists and turns to render even the most astute observer completely powerless. It's almost as if the film is daring the audience to guess the outcome, knowing full well that they won't even come close. It's manipulation to the extreme, and it makes the film's main question, \\"Are you watching closely?\\" all the more absorbing. How interesting that I allowed myself to fall for such trickery, especially since I usually don't like to be tricked. I can't recall the last time I enjoyed being this manipulated by a story; even the well-crafted \\"The Illusionist\\" didn't lure me in as deeply.    Maybe that's because \\"The Prestige\\" takes the illusory aspects one step further, first by telling the story out of sequence, second by including an intense rivalry. Taking place in London between the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the plot concerns two magicians: the sly Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and the consumed American Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman). They follow a three-act formula used by all magicians. As described by the illusion technician Cutter (Michael Caine), they are as follows: act one is The Pledge, in which a magician displays an everyday object; act two is The Turn, in which that everyday object is made to do something extraordinary, such as disappear; and act three is The Prestige, in which the object reappears, dazzling an audience too afraid to applaud at the end of act two.    The problem is that they follow this formula even when they're offstage, with one relying on his showmanship skills to outdo the other. As the film progresses, their antics get increasingly ugly, especially in Angier's case. How did such hostility come into being? It directly relates to Angier's wife, Julia (Piper Perabo), who died as the result of a failed magic trick. Both Angier and Borden were initially employed asaudience plants for a magic show, one that included Julia as the magician's assistant. The finale involved her being dropped into a locked water tank with her wrists and ankles tied. The tank was then covered for a short length of time. When the illusion was working successfully, she could slip out of the ropes and free herself. For the audience's perspective, it looked as if she magically transported out of the tank.    Her safety depended on the rope itself; in order to escape, a special knot had to be tied, one that would allow for easy loosening. After a while, Borden found that tying the same knot was too predictable; he wanted to tie a knot that looked more complex, as if to say to the crowd that she wouldn't be able to escape as easily. Only he and Julia thought the idea was worth a try, and because of that, we don't know for sure whether or not it was actually attempted. All we do know is that one night something went horribly wrong, and ultimately, Julia drowned in the tank. Even Cutter--who always waited offstage with an axe in case of such an emergency--was too late to save her (too bad CPR didn't exist in those days; there might have been a chance for her).    After the accident, the two men go their separate ways and star in their own magic shows. But for Angier, this doesn't mean that he's gotten over the whole mess; from his point of view, Borden is directly responsible for Julia's death. What's worse, Borden has a wife named Sarah (Rebecca Hall) and a daughter named Jess (Samantha Mahurin). Why does he deserve the family that Angier will never have? This ignites a vindictiveness Angier had never known before, a seething, white-hot vindictiveness that drives him into obsession. He's determined to ruin Borden's reputation, first by discovering the secrets to his greatest illusions, then by making them better. The trouble is that Borden refuses to give any of his secrets away; being a magician, he's committed to preserving the mysterious nature of an illusion. This goes double for The Prestige, which is always the most impressive act of a magic show.    A series of payback attempts are set into motion, most of which involve one man disguising as a spectator and volunteering during the other man's show. Several tricks are ruined, some people get hurt, and everyone comes away feeling humiliated. Cutter involves himself purely as an effects wizard and manager, rigging Angier up with the latest and greatest magic-making gizmos. But when he appoints a new assistant for Angier--Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson)--the stakes are raised even higher. After an initially harmonious relationship, Angier shows his true nature by ordering her to become Borden's assistant; hopefully, earning the enemy's trust will give her access to valuable information. But it soon becomes clear that she has her own agenda, specifically when it comes to her affair with Borden.     And this brings to light a fairly intricate subplot. While Sarah has yet to discover the truth of her husband's infidelity, she's known right from the start that he often behaves differently, despite his constant professions of love. \\"There are days when you mean it,\\" she says, insinuating that on other days, he's more in love with his magic tricks. It seems that with Borden, it's one evasion after another, with any attempt at personal discussion met with silence and vagueness. \\"Secrets are my life,\\" he says simply; it's a line that initially seems forgettable but ultimately takes on a wealth of significance. By the end of the film, the audience will come to understand just how important this subplot is.    They will also come to understand how deep a hole Angier is digging himself into. He's become aware a new illusion called The Transported Man; the magician enters a door on one side of the stage and immediately exits through another door on the other side of the stage. Borden has been praised for performing this trick, and because of that, Angier just has to learn the secret. And it seems as if he will; Because of Olivia, he now has possession of Borden's coded diary, one that can only be deciphered with a specific keyword (incidentally, Angier is also keeping a diary). This keyword leads Angier back to America, specifically to Colorado. In a remote mountain area, he meets the reclusive Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) and his assistant, Alley (Andy Serkis), both of whom are working on a top-secret electric device.    This device may be the key to upstaging Borden and his Transported Man trick. I'm afraid I can't say how. I'm also afraid I can't say what the device actually does. I can say this: watching it work is both awesome and frightening. A central metal sphere shoots lightening bolts in all directions, all of which gain in intensity when an object is placed in the machine's center. It's both respected and feared, like all new inventions are. But the role it ultimately plays is too important for me to describe, especially since it's part of a trial subplot that's woven throughout the film.     How does it all come together? What of Angier, Borden, and Cutter? I shouldn't even be hinting at these questions, for I fear that I've already said too much. Like a live magic show, \\"The Prestige\\" depends on secrecy in order to be completely effective. It also depends on your willingness to be fooled; many times I thought I had things figured out, and many times I was proven wrong. Almost every plot point in this film is turned on its head, and they go in directions I never expected them to go in. Maybe the loose structure is partially responsible; if the story does in fact follow the magician's three-act formula, then each act is probably not where it should be. The Prestige may be at the beginning. Then again, it may not be. Are you watching closely?
B00005JKJA|5.0|David Lynch has never been known to make movies for the masses. it seems like, you either love his work, or you hate it. This movie is a prime example. I have never seen a reviewer with mixed feelings about Mulholland Drive. Either you think it's garbage, or you think it's genius. I happen to be in the latter group. I will freely admit, it took two viewings for me to fully 'get' this film. and even now, a couple of years after i saw it for the first time, i am picking up subtle 'clues' and aspects to the film. that is rare in this day and age of 'cookie-cutter' hollywood movies. The plot is far too complicated and twisty to get into, and frankly has been gone over with a fine tooth comb already on this site. But, i will point out that one of the main highlights of this film for me, was the performace by Naomi Watts. She literally plays two different characters...completely different from each other, but the same. She is able to convey more emotion with just her facial expressions towards the end of the movie, then some actresses can with their entire body. This movie is a revelation on many levels. One of the best movies ever made. Period.
B000002KHB|5.0|Deep Purple had already created hard rock history when in the Spring of 1972 they released their most famous album, 'Machine Head'. 'In Rock' set the template, 'Fireball' expanded their sound and now the final album of this majestic trilogy put the quintet into the stratosphere. The story of the recording of this landmark lp is as legendary as the music and was perfectly captured in the band's most famous song, \\"Smoke on the Water\\". The riff has been both celebrated and villified as either genius or stupidity, but it is not the sole reason for the song's brilliance. \\"Highway Star\\" had been unfairly kicked to the curb by weight of comparison, when this is the more electrifying of the two tracks and is easily the greatest driving song ever! \\"Space Truckin'\\" and \\"Lazy\\" are so cool it's stupid. \\"Pictures of Home\\" round out this gallery of greats with its ethereal rhythms and great lyircs (plus another superb solo from Ritchie). Five virtuoso musicians at the peak of their powers as songwriters, producers (ably assisited by fellow legend Martin Birch) and performers. Blackmore cemented his reputation as hard rock's master soloist and his partner in crime, Lord, made the organ a true metal instrument. \\"Leo\\" and \\"Never Before\\" are okay, good songs but not classics ('Never Before\\" was the 1st single, kinda lame...)but the aforementioned other five take no prisoners. Ironically, 'Machine Head' is my least favorite of the three but that doesn't affect the respect that this disc demands. 1972 was still early in the history of what is today called heavy metal, but Zeppelin, Sabbath and Purple had almost said all that there would be to say....until Priest! One more classic to go and a live album to boot before the unravling of delicate personailites (Blackmore and Gillan) would destroy the band.
B000000HSU|5.0|This is a great album, but get the PVC Records release which is available on CD, the reason being that the Caroline re-issue has been sped up making HR sound like a chipmunk and the bass guitar and floor tom seem non-existent.  I don't know what the reviewer down below is thinking--with Rock for Light you get blazing furious hardcore assault with some reggae tunes where the extremely overhyped I Against I doesn't come close...If you like 80's rock mixed with hardcore than get I Against I...If your full of testosterone and you just wanna go nuts, then get Rock For Light!!!!!!!
B000GCFO0I|1.0|I won't go into detail but I just had to write that this is one of the worst movies I have ever had the misfortune to sit through. Everything about it is bad. The acting, script, directing, just plain awful. Steer clear!!!
032147404X|5.0|Since I'm offering an opinion (and review) on the book, The Digital Photography Book, I think a brief look at my background may give what follows a bit more veracity. I am an enthusiastic advanced amateur photographer with roughly 40 years of experience that includes a goodly number of awards and published photos. I shut down my wet darkroom a few years ago and have happily traded film and silver-based images for electrons, pixels and ink jet printing.  <br />Enough about me; now let's look at the latest book by Scott Kelby (of National Association of Photoshop Professionals fame): The Digital Photography Book.  <br />This is a different kind of animal in the world of self-help photography books. The author describes the experience of reading the book as having your good friend--who also happens to be an expert in digital photography--standing besides you while you're taking pictures. <br />The book lives up to Scott's description--complete with the frequent interjection of his quirky sense of humor. (Warning, watch out for the first page of Chapter One.) <br />I don't feel this is a book for complete novices--either in photography or in the use of digital equipment. Scott assumes the readers already know the basics of how their cameras work (what and where the controls are) and have used their cameras long enough to know what else they want to learn to take better photographs.  <br />Another reason some basic knowledge of photography is necessary to get the most from this book is that Scott doesn't shy away from including the terms in common use by digital photographers today: ISO, white balance, focal length, lens aperture, etc. He also assumes the readers have the desire to move up in the ranks from point-and-shooters to at least competent amateurs. Therefore, Scott includes numerous suggestions about photographic gear he feels can help any photographer take better pictures--and, although he breaks his suggestions down by price range, much of the gear still comeswith a hefty price tag. <br />A look at the chapter titles also confirms that Scott was not writing a teach-everything book for all readers. The 11 chapters include specialized topics, such as, Shooting Flowers like a Pro,  Shooting Weddings Like a Pro, Shooting Sports Like a Pro and Taking Advantage of Digital Like a Pro. For me, the final chapter, Photo Recipes to Help You Get \\"The Shot\\", was the best part of the book. This is where Scott puts everything together and takes his readers into the field to practice what they've learned. <br />So, do I like The Digital Photography Book? More importantly, do I recommend it? Yes, to both of these questions; but, as I mentioned above, to get the most out of the book, the reader should have at least point-and-shoot digital experience and a basic vocabulary of photographic terms. <br />One final note. The book can be read front to back, or chapters can be sampled at random to learn just the techniques each reader needs. At the offered price, I think The Digital Photography Book definitely has a place in a well-rounded photographer's library. <br />
B000GFLAI0|5.0|It shouldn't even be an option to rate a Dylan release as anything other than 5 (or more).<br /><br />All that is said here in support confirms this...he is in a class of one...alone...the only of his sort in our era.<br /><br />What else is there to say?
B0000029DD|5.0|I bought JB in 2001. When i listened to his CD for the first time, I couldn't feel his genius at all. I think it was because I was too young then and JB's musics are not easy-listening songs for beginners. After a few months I was hooked by his hypnotising voice suddenly, just like hitting by a thunder. JB was great in guitar and songwriting, but his mysterious voice is the essence of his music. He could express two contradictory feelings at a time, the vulnerabless and invinciblity. This feature makes him an inimitatable genius. Evert geniune artist has his own realm, like JB.
0783219695|5.0|There's little to say about this movie, since I assume that people interested in buying this item have seen it already. But the amount and quality of extras that this DVD has is just breathtaking. To say the least, Disc 2 has the IMAX version of the film, which at the time of this writing is not documented here in Amazon. The IMAX version is, well :), a shorter version of the film (1h55' versus the 2h20' of the regular) in an aspect ratio of 1:66. So if you were unsure as to buy the Widescreen or FullScreen versions, I suggest buying the Wide, since you will get (sort of) a full screen version in the IMAX one present on Disc 2.    Then there is this documentary \\"The conquest of space\\" which is rather dull, \\"The astronauts story\\" a very short but interesting clip, the excellent \\"making of\\" and the juicy commentary by Jim Lovell, pinpointing  hits and misses of the film compared to the real thing.    At $9.90, how can you NOT buy this jewel?
B00003CXB4|5.0|I was a rather big fan of \\"The Lion King\\" when I was a kid. I saw the movie a couple of times in the cinema, I'm pretty sure, I had the comic, and I used to draw the characters in a notebook or two. I saw it on DVD just now, for the first time in quite a while, and its still as good, I think. <br /> <br />The story is set on the African plains, where Mufasa the Lion King rules over the beasts. He has just had a son, an heir to this throne, Simba. He is an energetic and curious one, this cub, and his uncle Scar intends to take advantage of this. He wants to be the King of the beasts, and to do so he'll need both Mufasa and his son killed. He has a plan, and forging an unnatural alliance with the hyenas of the neighbouring territory, kills Mufasa and drives Simba out into strange and distant country, where he is rescued by Timon the Meerkat and Pumbaa the Warthog. As he grows older, Simba learns a lot of things, unlearns a lot of it, and eventually faces his destiny, that he is King of the beasts and that order and balance must be restored to the savannah. Will he be able to confront his uncle Scar and take back his Kingdom? <br /> <br />I quite like the look of this film. It's traditional animation for the most part, with a hint of computer effects in some scenes (the wilderbeest stampede, for instance). It's colourful, it's details, and the bad guys are curiously angular looking. As for the plot, it holds together nicely too. There is a tiny hint of pop culture-isms, (Timon and Pumbaa dressing up in Hawaiian gear as a diversion, a few of the hyenas jokes, etc) and it's all right in small doses. It's handled better than a lot of kids features these days, which are often just wall-to-wall impersonations of suburbia and media. There are a few songs in the film too, penned by Tim Rice and Elton John, including the hit \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\". I'm not the biggest fan of song and dance numbers in animated features, but they're done in such a way that it never getstoo sickly. I don't think so, anyway. <br /> <br />Worth a look for kids and fans of Disney.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|First of all the sound tracks on that dvd is amazing specially for those possesing an home cinema with dts decoder,the sounds effect are incredible. But the movie in itself is quite entertaining and with lots of effects and with a good plot.What to ask more ? so just buy it you won't be desappointed
B00005JPB4|4.0|I decided to check out \\"Flags Of Our Fathers\\" today because it seemed interesting to me. (I love movies with violence). It's a movie going back to when America was involved in the World War II back in 1944. The main part of the movie is based on a story telling of events that the characters were going through while fighting the Japaneese Army, and also it is sort of around an Iwo Jima controversy of who was apart of planting that flag and how the characters end becomming \\"heros\\" to the public. There are a lot of war scenes in this movie that shows alot of blood, head and limbs being blown off. So parents, if you are highly offended by violence towards you and your kids, I recommend that you don't come within 10 feet of this movie.<br /><br />As for anything bad. The only part that got annoying was the consistant flashback into the war scenes throughout the movie, so at some points it was a little hard for me to keep up with whats going on. Other than that, this is an enojoyable movie. It was based off the origonal book \\"Flags Of Our Fathers\\" (I'm not fully sure if it is based on a true story). I believed that Clint Eastwood and Stephen Spilberg did a very good job with this movie. If you like war movies with a lot of action, I highly recommend this movie to you.<br /><br />C. Infamous. Peace!
B00005JPBP|3.0|Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Borden (Christian Bale) are apprentices  working for stage magician Cutter (Michael Caine).  One night, tragedy strikes the act; Angier's wife dies on stage and Borden is blamed.  The two strike out on their own, each gaining in reputation while trying to destroy the other.  Borden gets a wife, child, and mistress (Scarlett Johansson), while Angier goes to scientist Tesla (David Bowie) in search of the ultimate illusion.<br /><br />This film is often compared with \\"[[ASIN:B000K7VHQ4 The Illusionist]],\\"  which is also about a performing magician at the turn of the 20th century, but this movie isn't nearly as good.  The actors do their job (Caine and Johansson are the best; Bale has an oddly 21st century hair cut) and the period is recreated nicely, but I didn't care about or like anyone.  The story  was endlessly confusing, and ultimately based on something that is impossible.  The reveal makes you say, \\"Oh,\\" instead of \\"OH!\\"  Dialogue is often mumbled, and I wasn't even sure of the two main characters' names for a long time.  Their appearance and personalities are too similar; neither stands out as a \\"hero.\\"  It would have been much better had it been told chronologically, but scenes are in random order, which is irritating.  We know the ending from the beginning, so there is no build-up of tension and the magic isn't fun.  Disappointing.
0060977493|4.0|Ms. Roy is a very unusual writer. What an extraordinary look at cast, politics, love, loss, and culture. I can not say that I love Ms. Roy's writing, but her story is powerful and a must read. My wife however loves her writing. Ms. Roy takes analogy to a new level. As in other books that I have read on India, this book provides a glimpse into culture, love, and loss and will challenge your sense of justice.
B00099BPP6|4.0|As a 24 yr. old rock-and-roller, I checked the cassette tapes of this recording out of the library in 1966 out of curiosity. As somebody completely new to opera, I just tolerated the music enough to keep listening. Then came the Act II quartet which blew me and then my wife away. We almost wore the borrowed cassettes out.  <br /> <br />We eventually turned into multi-decade season ticket holders and love the entire world of opera, but Rigoletto remains our favorite. In our minds Rigoletto is the operetic standard, a \\"perfect\\" balance and meshing of drama, technical fireworks, lyricism, melody, emotion, memorable characterization, solos and duets, ensemble pieces, choral and orchestral music. When this recording became available on CD, we rejoiced and bought it to add to our collection of two other Rigoletto recordings. <br /> <br />We were lucky starting our life-long love affair with opera with this 1964 recording. Renata Scotto is in perfect voice. Carlo Bergonzi as the Duke is warm, lyrical, and seductive. Dietrich Firsher-Dieskau as Rigoletto also has a warm, lyrical voice, unusual for Rigoletto but beautifully heartbreaking. The chorus of courtiers plays a critical starring role in Rigoletto and the La Scala chorus is superb as always, as is the direction by Rafael Kubelik. The sound quality is fuzzy by current standards, hence the 4 star rating, but is very acceptable for casual listening such as in an automobile.  <br /> <br />If you don't have any other recordings of Rigoletto, I'd recommend the recording with Joan Sutherland, Luciano Pavarotti, Sherill Milnes, and the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Richard Bonynge, for the excellent sound quality and poweful performances. However, you can't go wrong with this recording, especially for the price.

B000H305U0|1.0|Finally we got this album, but it was not up to what I anticipated.  Overall it was just disappointing vocally and musically.  Probably won't be playing this one much.  Very disappointed in the lyrics too.
0425163407|2.0|Then you'll probably like this story.   <br /> <br />My wife and I read books together and I'd sworn off Cornwell after Hornet's Nest (which on TV Cornwell admitted was some warmed over college material - and it showed horribly).  The Scarpetta character (in some books) is unbelievably emotionally ultra-hyper (going from confident to terrified every time Marino knocks on the door).   <br /> <br />In this book she was mercifully level headed almost ALL the time!  What a relief.  And there was a real story.  I'm not really a fan of her work over the last 10 years but there's almost enough lab details here to satisfy.  Sure wish she (Scarpetta) would learn to delegate - imagine the top lab expert for her state and she has to go to every crime scene and move bodies herself!   <br /> <br />Anyway don't start here with the Scarpetta series - but if you already like the character, this one is a B+.  Compared to other crime novels in general, it's still a C- in my estimation.
B000H0MKOC|4.0|Aaron Eckhart has to be one of the most underrated actors today.  He makes another flawless performance in \\"Thank You For Smoking\\" - a comedy about tabacco, spin control, and public perceptions.  \\"Smoking\\" does a great job of showing how today's PR departments and \\"Spin Doctors\\" operate and just what their MO is exactly.<br /><br />Young Cameron Bright (Running Scared, X-Men 3) shows why he is a promising young actor in doing a superb job of playing Eckhart's son.<br /><br />The one funny thing about this movie - there is not one single scene with someone smoking a cigarette.<br /><br />Watch it - you will not be dissappointed.
B000GRUS22|3.0|Michael Cretu (aka Enigma)offer's up his sixth album in sixteen years. I own all of them, and was there when \\"Sadness, Pt. 1\\" hit the airwaves in America back in 1991. Since that time, each release has varied little in style. Cretu is certainly a good producer, and each Enigma release has demonstrated this. Cretu is also a classically trained musician, though I don't really hear this reflected in any of his Enigma albums. He has given us solid new age/ambient/electronic music for meditation, relaxation and escape.<br /><br />Perhaps \\"A Posteriori\\" should be a farewell--a time to close up shop. Cretu seems to just spin his wheels, particularly on his last three Enigma albums. If you pressed me to give you what I think are the best Enigma albums I would tell you 1993's \\"The Cross Of Changes\\" and 1996's \\"Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!\\" Creatively, those two releases are song for song solid. I don't think Cretu has topped his crowning achievement which is the song \\"Return To Innocence\\", which, by the way, is repeated here with the similar sounding \\"Goodbye Milky Way\\".<br /><br />\\"A Posteriori\\" has everything: slow, medium and fast tempo tracks filled with atmospherics and otherworldliness. Two tracks come with complete lyrical structure: \\"Invisible Love\\" and \\"Goodbye Milky Way\\".<br /><br />This issue at hand with \\"A Posteriori\\" is whether Cretu has pushed his creativity at all. \\"A Posteriori\\" sounds like all of his other Enigma albums with little variation. Cretu is similar to other new age/rock artists like Mike Oldfield, Deep Forest, B-Tribe and Enya, but I think Oldfield is the only one who has continued to shake up his sound and try different things over the years.<br /><br />So, bottom line, if you like Enigma (as I do), you will enjoy \\"A Posteriori\\", but if, like me, you want Cretu to try something new, this isn't it. As I say with many established artists, what do they have to lose by trying something different after all these years?
B000HCO83Q|4.0|X-Men 3 - the somewhat final chapter in this above average trilogy.  While I throughly enjoyed this movie (after the first X-Men movie came out, I pre-judged it thinking it would be horrid, not the case at all) I do think that this movie missed its potential. <br /> <br />I liked the addition of all the new characters, but I believe it may have prevented some of the story development.  After watching \\"Last Stand\\" I would really like to see a 4th X-Men movie, but believe there will only be spin-off movies (Wolverine, Magneto).  Plus some fairly major characters die so I think they'd be forced to do a pre-quel. <br /> <br />Anyway, this is a good movie that you should definately see, especially if you saw the first two.  Enjoy.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Yes, this comment will enrage many.  That said, I believe that this work comes out ahead of Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit in terms of its importance to music in the last twenty years.  When asked that \\"If you were trapped on a desert island question...\\" I always think of OK Computer and Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon as the two albums that would sustain me.  This is music that will remain with you for the rest of your days if you listen carefully and with an open mind.
B000HA4WT8|4.0|After buying the original \\"The Fast and The Furious\\" I found most of my enjoyment came from making fun of the movie and shaming it.  However, I can now say I am a fan of the trilogy (all 3 films are good). <br /> <br />Lucas Black is simply The Man and gives another great performance here.  Bow Wow does a surprisingly good job as well.  Car buffs and street racers will especially like this movie (which I am neither).  This is a fast paced and exciting action packed movie that many will enjoy.

B000HBKCDC|4.0|Nevermind this is a X'mas album. Nevermind we've been waiting for 3 years and Sarah's only treating us to an album of x'mas oldies. Nevermind the silly critiques.<br /><br />Sarah McLachlan knows only one thing - to move with her voice and songs. If anything's worth buying the album for, it would be the original title track, Wintersong. You'd probably not ever hear a Xmas song so heart-wrenching that it makes you pine for the person you've loved the most and then lost. It made me cry.<br /><br />Then there's the beautiful rendition of the Joni-Mitchell favorite River. It's beautifully touching and melancholy. Sarah made it hers.<br /><br />As for the rest of the album, they are covers of standard Xmas fare with an added McLachlan touch.<br /><br />This album will tide fans over until when Sarah is ready to charm us with another album of all-new stuff.

The orchestration (campy in many spots) , has NO PLACE on masterpieces such as \\"Six Degrees\\" and \\"Metropolis\\"..... <br />2.\\"The Spirit Carries On\\" is a CLASSIC.

0393325172|5.0|I have just finished this series and the only bad thing that I have to say about it is that I have just finished this series.  Oh, I wish it weren't over! <br /> <br />Plenty has been written about the characters, plots, etc., so I just want to say that I'm a \\"chick\\" and I loved this series, and I also want to add comments from a parent's perspective. <br /> <br />I finally got around to seeing the movie about a year and a half ago and immediately went on the internet to find out more.  I felt that the movie was suitable for my elementary-aged children (with supervision), and tried to find out whether the books would also be okay as most of my reading is done via audio books with my children in the car (I've become a big fan of classical literature, so they are used to hearing books that are above their reading level). <br /> <br />Unfortunately for my children, while the adult themes in the movie will go over their heads and I will let them watch it, the adult themes in the books will not (so they don't get to read the books yet).  There is strong profanity, extreme drunkenness, prostitution, adultery, homosexuality, bestiality, and rather straightforward talk about sex.  None of it is gratuitous or unnecessarily graphic, but it is too much for children.   I'm guessing 16 is probably the youngest at which I would be comfortable with them reading this series, but that is only a guess as my children have a way to go before then.
B000002ILG|4.0|Now, let me start off by saying that I am a BIG White Lion fan. I own every album they did except for Fight To Survive (which I'm soon to own as I ordered it, hehe). Though one of my favorite songs of all time by them, which happened to be off the Fight To Survive album titled \\"All The Fallen Men\\", really let me see a heavier side to them, I believe Pride best demonstrates their effort in a heavy, yet not so raw feel. Let me break down each song and tell you what I think, personally. <br /> <br />Hungry- 10/10: The first song on the album, and indeed it's a very explosive way to kick things off. The song comes in with a nice power guitar (alone at this time), which gives you an almost pure arena rock sense. The drums then kick in, and everything comes together very nicely from there forward. Very well produced, and of course a great solo by Bratta. <br /> <br />Lonely Nights- 10/10: My favorite song on the whole album! A beautiful acoustic guitar coming in to play the riff, which is followed by a distorted rhythm repeating the riff again, only a step higher (I believe). Great vocals by Tramp which really fit the tone, but the most memorable part of the song, for me, was the absolutely incredible solo by Vito Bratta. One of his best solos ever, in my opinion. <br /> <br />Don't Give Up- 9/10: Keeping up the fast pace, a more popish sounding tune places as the third track on the album. In fact, if anything, the melody is the greatest aspect of this song. The vocals were top notch, and the half step up was executed perfectly. The only thing that made me give a 9 for this song was the rather uninventive lyrics. Overall, great song though. <br /> <br />Sweet Little Loving- 8/10: Normally, I'd say a song like this is great. However, for White Lion standards (well, maybe just in my eyes), it's okayish. It's got a pretty catchy chorus and all, but I just have that lasting memory that I get from most White Lion classics. <br /> <br />Lady Of The Valley- 10/10: \\"Lady of the Valley/Can you bring him back/To the days when we were kids\\"...One word, oustanding! The longest song on the album, but every second of it is worth the listen. Awsome intro from a slow, but soothing distorted riff leading into a mysterious-like fingerplay. What I love about this song is just all the progressive changes made throughout it. Against, great vocals by Tramp. This one's a definite keeper. <br /> <br />Wait- 9/10: This was the first hit single from the Pride album. A lot like their song Tell Me, it has a rather memorable melody and some catchy hooks in there as well. On the other hand, for me...this, by far, wasn't my favorite song on the album. <br /> <br />All You Need Is Rock In Roll- 1/10: I guess I can't really comment on this song, as I kind of thought it was a waste of time adding it to the album. But don't be fooled. White Lion are some of the best musicians around, possibly my favorite band of all time, but everyone must have their downfall. <br /> <br />Tell Me- 10/10: Ah, the second hit from their Pride release. Unlike Wait, I enjoyed mostly every aspect of this song. The lyrics were pretty decent, but what stood out more than anything was their driving melody and a chorus that would stick in your head for quite awhile. Also, a fantastic lead part by Bratta...again. <br /> <br />All Join Our Hands- 7/10: The way this song was put together sounds very anthem-like, and I believe that's the way they intended, so good job on that. The reason I give this song a seven is because, even though the idea and production behind the song was great, I thought the song itself lacked a lot. <br /> <br />When The Children Cry- 10/10: Now, most people would disagree with me when I say that When The Children Cry was, and still is, an excellent song. Superior fingerplay work by Bratta, and a nice emotional solo in the middle part. I'm not really sure Mike Tramp's vocals were strong enough in this one, but they were still good. <br /> <br />Overall, I give this albumfour stars. Me being a big fan, you probably would have expected five, but I'm very picky on my music :). There are really only two songs that I think fill this album, and those are \\"All Join Our Hands\\" and \\"All You Need Is Rock And Roll.\\" The other eight tracks are tremendous. My favs from the album were \\"Lonely Nights, Lady Of The Valley, and Tell Me.\\" <br /> <br />If you only purchase one White Lion album, make it this one!!!
0735619670|5.0|Code Complete pops up regularly on the lists of the 'read this book or you'll never get a job and everyone else will laugh at you' genre, so if you're easily influenced, like me, you may approach this book with an air of duty rather than anticipation. Fortunately, despite its heft, this is well worth the plaudits that have been heaped upon it. I actually enjoyed this more than The Pragmatic Programmer and Programming Pearls, two books often mentioned in the same breath as this tome. <br /> <br />CC covers pretty much every part of the software development lifecycle, from planning to code reviews to testing. These are all pretty good discussions, but the best bit is definitely the chapters on coding. Most of the examples are in Visual Basic or Java, so you'd do well to know one of those languages. <br /> <br />When it comes to object modelling, there's actually a reasonable set of guidelines harvestable from literature, and languages tend to diverge more on issues of packaging, so CC is at its best at the lower level procedural details of code layout, formatting, loop construction, optimisation and so on. Many books claim to provide coding guidelines, but don't do much beyond stating the obvious like (for Java) \\"use camel case for variable names\\", \\"start class names with capital letters\\" and \\"avoid Hungarian notation\\". CC is different because it actually provides useful recommendations. As an example, there's a very good discussion on when and where the use of loop-breaking constructs like break and continue ('next' in Ruby and Perl) are appropriate. Few (if any) other books provide this sort of practical detail. <br /> <br />It's well-written, with just the right amount of humour in its exhortations - the withering references to coders who investigate loop bugs by randomly adjusting the termination criterion up or down by one until it works raised a wry smile from this reviewer. <br /> <br />To summarise, this is a collection of best practices distilled from a pretty huge amount of reading, and is genuinely helpful. I would certainly point any programming beginner at this book.
B000HEVALC|5.0|Just want to agree with the previous reviewer. Although this session has been released many times before, this version is complete and in very good quality. it's worth the price just to hear Elvis talking on the Don't Be Cruel track about a fellow singers approach to that song - magic!
B00005JPBP|3.0|The Prestige doesn't compare with The Illusionist.  Prestige was too long, too convoluted, and had too many places where I said, \\"Ugh\\".  I didn't like the squished birds right from the getgo.  I had a hard time following the plot.  Who was reading from the journal?  Why were the voices in the journal not the same as the actor's speaking voices?  Why didn't I care if either magician won?  It was like a case of I can top that.  I sincerely didn't care if either one came out on top.  I didn't like Jackman or Bale. (and there were some scenes where I thought Jackman looked terrible--was that on purpose?  <br />   I saw the trailer for this movie and by chance found the trailer for The Illusionist.  I saw The Illusionist several weeks ago.  For me, there is no comparison as I feel The Illusionist beat The Prestige on all levels.  It had a unique setting, a wonderful protagonist in Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, who never disappoints, and a riveting, uncluttered story.  The Prestige just seemed to go on and on.  I found myself checking my watch every 15 minutes.  The Illusionist could have gone on another 45 minutes. <br />   I realize you should take every movie on its own merits, but there were too many similarities.  After all, how many magician movies have there been in the past few years?  But, the difference was in the telling and the heart.  The Prestige seemed like it just wanted to show a game of one up man ship, where The Illusionist told a riveting, emotional story.  I sought out the short story The Illusionist was based on.  I won't be doing the same for The Prestige.   <br />    Edward Norton's lovely voice was one of the saving graces of Kingdom of Heaven.  He didn't disappoint in The Illusionist.  He was absolutely riveting. IMO, Christian Bale should stick to doing magic in the bat suit.  It worked better.
B000GY729M|5.0|`Sam's Town' is the sophomore offering from Brit sounding US rockers, The Killers, on which they sound more American than before - Bruce Springsteen circa late seventies/early eighties to be exact.<br /><br />`When you were young' is probably the best song The Boss never recorded, a throbbing rocker with an anthemic chorus. Great!! `Sam's town', `For reasons unknown', `The river is wild', and `Read my mind' are more songs in that ilk.<br /><br />Standouts have got to be `Bling (confession of a king)', a soaring galloping rocker with jangly guitars which is simply brilliant, the more mellow `Uncle Jonny' (think 'Andy, you're a star') with wailing guitars, and the very Brit sounding razor sharp, upbeat, maddeningly catchy `Bones'.<br /><br />Slowing things down is the epic `My list' featuring a vulnerable delivery from Brandon Flowers, the lovely Brit (especially The Cure) sounding `Why do I keep counting?', and the brief Beatlesesque 'Exitlude'.<br /><br />Featuring a bigger, more stadium sound, this CD performs the rare feat of improving on the band's debut, which was itself a killer!!
1594200823|2.0|This book has some very interesting information in it. The main message is that we are using one foodstuff in America in so many ways that it leads to bloat -- too much available cheap processed food, too many calories, exaggerated serving sizes to connote value, and a lack of a food culture strong enough to resist the confusion sown by food marketers. Great points! However, the author suffers from what he decries. What should have been a lean, mean 175 pages turns into a bloated and meandering tome, boring in too many spots, while losing the thread more often than not. Just because words come cheaply, and because people are impressed by (and will presumably pay a higher price for) a large serving of text doesn't mean that it is good for any of us. Yet, there wasn't an editorial culture strong enough at his publisher to fight this off. Shame. If an abridged version ever came out, it would be worth reading. But, the serving size needs to be halved. This is the Big Gulp version of what could have fit in a demitasse.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|The sweeper could be a great product if the battery was not such a piece of junk.  I would pull mine out of the charger after leaving it overnight, and it took only a few times before the battery hit the 5-minute mark for holding a charge.  Bought two sweepers, and my partner's sweeper did the same thing.  Don't buy it.  It's a rip off.
B000FTWB7G|3.0|Normally, I would listen to an album like 'The Open Door' and give it five stars. However, Amy Lee and friends set themselves a hard act to follow with 'Fallen', and 'The Open Door' falls far short of the mark. Ben Moody is a god among songwriters, and - as I expected, but hoped otherwise - the music has suffered without him. 'The Open Door' is good. 'Fallen' was sublime, superb, haunting, melodic, beautiful, intense and a plethora of other adjectives. Given the radio airplay of 'Call Me When You're Sober', 'The Open Door' will probably do very well. But don't look for another 'Going Under' or 'My Immortal' here... 'cuz you won't find it.
B00005JP87|5.0|You absolutely can't go wrong in deciding to see this movie.  As I was waiting to go in, a man coming out of an earlier showing said this was the best movie he had seen all year.  As we had driven 40 miles to see The Illusionist, I sincerely hoped he was correct.  He was, to my delight.<br /><br />  This was a superb little movie.  Edward Norton was absolutely riveting, Paul Giamatti cements his place as one of America's premiere actors, and Jessica Biel pulled off what could have been for her too much of a stretch.  The characters were that important must for a movie--they were all likable.  You wanted to see The Illusionist pull it off.  This movie had twists and turns that caught me unawares<br /><br />  The scenery was breathtaking and it was wonderful to see a period piece.  It was so refreshing to see a different setting and something different at the movies.<br /><br />  The true test of a movie is whether I want it to end ( and end quickly) and will I be able to watch it again.  The answers are NO and Yes.  It could have gone on another 45 minutes and I can't wait for the DVD.<br /><br />  I found The Illusionist after I had seen the trailer for The Prestige.  I sort of got the movies mixed up.  But, having seen The Illusionist first and The Prestige last night, I can say there is no comparison.  The Prestige was too long, too convuluted, and had characters I had no sympathy for.<br /><br />  Save your money for The Illusionist DVD and skip The Prestige.  IMO, there is no comparison.  The little movie shows that it can.  (And it did, many times over).
0743298020|5.0|I finished The Thirteenth Tale days ago and just can't get the story or characters out of my mind. But, that's one of Setterfield's themes in this wonderful gothic tale. Stories stick with us. I loved one of the statements made by Margaret Lea, the narrator. She says that it's difficult to start a new book when threads of the one we've just finished are still clinging to us. That's the way it's been for me with this novel. Setterfield does a marvelous job of creating an old-fashioned, dark twisty plot filled with dark themes. The house where most of the story occurs is almost a character itself. I wish I could see it on vacation in England - it felt that real. When everything is tied up for us at the end of the book, we still don't want to leave this world behind. I won't recount the plot as others have done much better than I could, but I will say that this is a fascinating, compelling tale that will cling to you, a story you will continue to ponder. Setterfield is one of those amazing writers whom both critics and readers like myself (who tend to just read best-sellers) will adore.
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|This is a great little connector. It allows me to connect Firewire 400 drives to my Firewire 800 port. This gives me access to another port, which makes for faster data transfers, because I can have both channels working at the same time. There's nothing to go wrong. It's a simple connector that just works.
B000002UTT|3.0|I'm a longtime Roxette fan (had Joyride when I was 10 and wore the tape down to tatters) and then again with Have A Nice Day, which made me a permanent fan and made me look into their full catalogue. This features such classics as - besides the above mentionent imminent Joyride and Have A Nice Day - Crash! Boom! Bang! (excellent), Room Service (very good) and Tourism (excellent), not to mention a number of fantastic compilation CDs. Latest, I turned to this, their first proper album (not counting Pearls Of Passion), and as I expected, this album showed to be below par with their later albums. <br /> <br />The album is very divided actually, between some *really* good songs, and then some *really* bad songs. The good ones include classics The Look, Dressed For Success, Dangerous, and Listen To Your Heart, but also less known tracks like the ballad Cry, and the uptempo Sleeping Single and (I Could Never) Give You Up, that all stand the test of time and still stand out as keepers. Paint is not a brilliant track, but it has qualities that justifies its inclusion on the album. <br /> <br />The rest of the tracks all sound terribly much like dated 80's songs. Shadow Of A Doubt is probably the best of the bunch, but it's not very good, and Dance Away, Chances (this was actually first single!), Half A Woman, Half A Shadow and View From A Hill are either so horrible or so forgettable that they should never have made it anywhere near an album. <br /> <br />So, if you're a completist, you should get this album, and if you only have the compilation Cds, you will even find a couple of good tracks here you probably didn't know. But the album itself is not really good, and if you only go for the good stuff, it's pretty much all included on the recent Roxbox (unfortunately not counting (I Could Never) Give You Up). So no, I won't recommend this CD.

B0007XT87G|5.0|I have been a PT fan for some years now having downloaded/purchased most of their albums as well as their live concerts.  Their work has always held inspiration...the thing about taking things to the edge is that you do not always hit what is popular and trendy.   It seems to me that these guys have been marginal but their musical experimentations are starting to pay off with stuff that as one reviewer put it, that when you listen to it, you need someone to \\"peel you off the wall\\".  It is simply wild, gorgeous, dynamic, interesting, moving, and at times incredibly inspired.  The title track, Deadwing, knocked me on my glutes...I simply did not expect it given the rather quiet opening.  Arriving somewhere is complex and beautiful. <br /> <br />I dont know...i read these reviews sometimes and reviewers can be all over the map...but the reviews here all seem to give pretty high marks!!! ... if you like to rock, and you have never heard PT before, just DO IT!!!!!

B00005JPBR|5.0|The cast and acting are suberb.  The flashbacks are all part of the misdirection and mystery.  Watch closely. <br /> <br />Based at the turn of the 19th to the 20th centuries, when the industrial revolution was converting from steam to electricity.  It mixes magic and science and details the fictional rivlary of two magicians and as a sub-plot the real-life rivalry of two famous inventors of the time. <br /> <br />I have not seen the Illusionist yet, so I can't compare, but as a glorious mystery, it rivals Anthony Shaefer's Sleuth (both the stage and movie version) which curiously, Michael Caine also starred in.

B000002UZ1|5.0|The Beatles' \\"Blue Album\\" celebrates their talent by boasting nothing but just some of their infamous hits from the years 1967-1970. These songs come from several of the greatest rock albums of all time including Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, The Beatles (\\"The White Album\\"), Abbey Road and Let It Be. The Beatles' \\"Blue Album\\" both proves their genius and demonstrates their singular talent that no other band can replicate.<br /><br />The two CD set allows us to realize that The Beatles wrote many different types of songs with different styles. This is also essential music that offers something for just about anyone who listens to the two CD set. The first CD starts off strong with the popular and psychedelic \\"Strawberry Fields Forever,\\" other psychedelic and experimental songs include \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\" and \\"I Am The Walrus.\\" There are beautiful ballads celebrating love including \\"All You Need Is Love\\" and \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da.\\" The Beatles also address the angst of a love that is no longer in the songs \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and \\"The Long And Winding Road.\\" Finally, the band sings songs that are just plain fun including \\"Octopus's Garden\\" and \\"Back In The U.S.S.R.\\"<br /><br />Another reviewer makes an excellent point: If you want to understand the sharp differences in style between John Lennon and Paul McCartney at this time in their careers there is no better comparison than between \\"Hey Jude,\\" which is an classic ballad indeed, and \\"Revolution,\\" which is rather conceited, smug and bitter all at once.<br /><br />The Beatles' use of the unconscious when writing trippy songs like \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and \\"A Day In The Life\\" enabled them to reach out to their fans and ultimately the world. The lyrics make sense even when they make no sense; this only adds to the beauty of the more psychedelic, trippy songs. Moreover, the songs on this two CD set work so well because they address universal themes of wanting to be loved, celebrating love and mourning a lost love.<br /><br />The liner notes boast the lyrics to each song and great color photos of the band. The liner notes include the song credits, too.<br /><br />Indeed, The Beatles were so prolific in their writing and performing that this two CD set barely skims the surface of what they truly accomplished between the years 1967 and 1970. If you like this CD set I highly recommend you buy individual Beatles' albums to discover more about the band's creativity and boldness.<br /><br />Overall, this two CD set is more than just an introductory retrospective of The Beatles' music during the turbulent late 1960s. The \\"Blue Album\\" celebrates The Beatles' ability to communicate their political beliefs and amorous feelings for other people through their songs. These songs remind us to understand and appreciate the blessings of love, the evils of war and the importance of world peace--now.<br /><br />I highly recommend this CD for Beatles fans, fans of great 1970s rock music and anyone who wants to experience how The Beatles taught us what was right through their music.

B000HT386M|3.0|`Click' released on '06 started with a promising premise, excellent special effects, the presence of the enchanting Kate Beckinsale and the wacky Christopher Walken. A very good beginning to this tale of one mans' opportunity to see how his life will unfold via the use of a universal remote control that allows him to control time. Sounds intriguing don't you think? Unfortunately it's downhill from there.<br /><br />To be honest I'm not an Adam Sandller fan, so my like or dislike of this film is based largely on my appreciation, or lack of thereof of his performance in the tile role as Michael Newman the workaholic gifted with the mysterious remote.<br /><br />Bottom line, the film doesn't work for my. The main character just isn't a likeable guy he's rude, sarcastic and obsessive. There are a few funny moments but by the end you simply don't care if he figures out the meaning of life or not. To paraphase Christopher Walken's famous line from Saturday Night Live, \\"I gotta have more Kate Beckinsale!\\" Watch `It's A Wonderful Life' instead.<br /><br />`Click' also featuring Henry Winkler, Sean Astin and David Hasselhoff.

B00005A0ZH|3.0|The perils of working towards an anniversary and trying to beat a rival project to the screen are all too evident in 1492 - Conquest of Paradise. It's easily Ridley Scott's most beautiful looking film, designed and shot with real love and care. With almost every shot gorgeous enough to take down and frame, it's like walking through an art gallery at times. Unfortunately that's never enough to compensate for a terrible screenplay by Roselyne Bosch that seems to have been written on the bus to work and stumbles from cliché to cliché. Carry On Columbus has better dialog at times, not to mention a better grasp of history. Worst of all, it throws away the real dramatic potential in Columbus' life for an unconvincing slice of class warfare - wouldn't you know it, it was really all those pesky upper class Euro trash aristo types like Michael Wincott that screwed up paradise, not Columbus' own incompetence and incredible cruelty - while painting him as the `chosen one.' At one point when the Inquisition ask our compassionate visionary if he is comparing himself to Christ, there's even a dramatic pause as he thinks it over in that he-is-you-know tipping the nod to the audience way. The result is a film that wants to be up there with Herzog's Spanish nutter in the jungle movies but is too expensive to allow its protagonist to go all Klaus Kinski on it and run the risk of alienating the audience, leaving us with more excuses and special pleading than drama. <br /> <br />Strangely, no-one in front of or behind the camera seems to notice just how bad the script is (\\"Excuse me, but you're the only queen I know,\\" Columbus tells Isabella, soliciting the even more unlikely reply \\"You're the only navigator I know, so that makes us even.\\"), and both performances and technical standards are all worthy of a much better film. The film has quite a few great cinematic moments, usually visually led and supported by Vangelis' excellent score, but it's too obvious that Scott wanted to filmthese scenes and tried to fit enough of a movie around them in the belief that he could carry the audience over the shoals without pulling it off. You can see the rationale behind moments like the hurricane that wipes away his new city and renders him paralysed, but without the real emotional journey into madness the film needs it's just setpiece filmmaking. Still, sometimes looking good is good enough - but not good enough for 154 minutes. It's a shame that they didn't read Kirkpatrick Sale's excellent historical biography instead of just using the title. <br /> <br />The transfer of Pathe's 2.35:1 widescreen UK PAL DVD of the uncut European version isn't always as good as it could be. The only extra is a trailer from the time when the film was still going to be called 'Columbus.'
B000FTWB7G|4.0|Great sophmoric effort for the band Evanescence.  \\"The Open Door\\" has a slightly different sound than their previous album \\"Fallen\\" but I think it works for them.  Not a CD that hits you right away but eventually does after many listens.  I'm extremely surprised Amy pushed for \\"CMWYS\\" to be the first single off the CD.  This is not one of my favorites and gets very little play time on my CD player.  My favorite by far is \\"Lithium\\".  For me, this is the \\"BMTL\\" of \\"Fallen\\".  Just a beautiful song sure to be a hit.  It would be a shame to see them choose \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\" instead as their second single as it too is not one of the better songs on the album. <br /> <br />After \\"Lithium\\" I would have to say \\"Snow White Queen\\" gets the most play in my car.  People are saying it's too chaotic but it's meant to be that way.  It is very Imogen Heap-esque and just makes the chorus that much better and the bridge in that song is simply incredible in the way it builds and builds into this powerful melody.  Probably the best part of the album. <br /> <br />\\"The Only One\\" and \\"Your Star\\" are also amazing songs.  The first one hits you right away and is more radio-friendly than the second but \\"Your Star\\" really grows on you and is the more complex and interesting song on the CD.  I wish there were more songs like it on the album.  It's nice to hear something out of the ordinary and not so formulae.  Other notables on the CD are \\"All That I'm Living For\\" which is one that always gets me to pump up the volume and \\"Weight of the World\\" which is a pretty good rockin' song. <br /> <br />All in all a very good CD that does need to grow on you but, when it does, will be hard to take out of the player.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Batman, like the Phoenix, has risen from the ashes and has returned with 'Batman Begins'. This movie is truly amazing and is never dull. I have seen this film many times and it is just as fresh and just as exciting as it was when I watched it for the first time.<br /><br />Christian Bale has taken Batman and made it his own. I didn't think anyone could top Michael Keaton's performance as the dark knight, but I was wrong. The entire film in itself is truly unbelievable. I wasn't that big of a fan of Ra's Al Ghoul before this movie, but he was the best villain for it. Cillian Murphey was also the perfect choice for Scarecrow. Overall, everyone was right for who they portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />Let's not forget the locations that we see in this movie. All truly breath taking. Batman fans rejoice! This is a movie that is not something you should miss. Every single person owes it to themselves to see this movie. One of the best movies of last year.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|When the development plagued Superman Returns finally got off the ground thanks to X-Men and Usual Suspects director Bryan Singer, the reins had to be passed to Brett Ratner, director of Rush Hour films and Red Dragon. Many people gave a sigh of disappointment since Ratner is less a director than more a \\"session player\\" that musicians use in the studio. What made the previous films work was that not only were they great comic book movies, they were just simply great movies with action scenes as well as some deeper issues and meanings. X-Men 3 became what the series shouldn't have been: a blockbuster and nothing more. <br /> <br />The main inspiration for the film is the \\"Dark Phoenix\\" saga, arguably one of the most-well known and best sagas in Marvel's history. Jean Grey has been brought back to life after her death in X2 only she seems...changed. She seems a bit more uninhibited and carries a bit of a mean streak. Meanwhile, scientists at Worthington Labs have developed a cure of the mutant gene and are planning to allow willing mutants to take it and be \\"normal\\". Of course this infuriates Magneto and he establishes the Brotherhood, a group of mutants who are going to stop the cure no matter how. <br /> <br />One complaint that's always been in the X-Men films is the sheer number of characters. Unlike the comics where you can actually do an arc on one character alone, here they jampack it with a whole bunch of characters that it's kind of overwhelming. In addition to X2's cast (besides sorely-missed Nightcrawler), we have Juggernaut, Callisto, Quill, Angel, Beast, Multiple Man and Kitty Pryde. Hell, I think they even added in Psylocke and some others not even mentioned. It ends up making an already big cast bloated. Not to mention certain characters react differently than before and an off-screen death is just inexcusable. <br /> <br />The anticipated notions of an X-Men movie tend to be scenes exclusively related to a character. Whether it's fight scenes like Wolverine vs Lady Deathstrike or the Nightcrawler attack on the White House, it's also geeky to see a scene of fights and mayhem. This film certainly has it from a small-but-cool cameo of a Sentinel to a big fight involving a house and the epic finale, it's certainly great to see things in a bigger proportion. Only problem is the scenes don't have an emotional resonance, it's just \\"time to see some computer-y stuff\\". <br /> <br />If you manage to be a fan of this, is this worth buying? Depends if you want special features. All we have are alternate endings, deleted scenes and pat-on-the-back commentaries. If you're looking for some in-depth stuff, you'd best look to the eventual double-dip.
B000BNX3B4|5.0|A very good romantic comedy, Must Love Dogs, brings to the screen the story of a man and a woman who meet each other through the Internet after having recently gotten out of some pretty painful divorces.  <br />It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.   <br />Diane Lane, John Cusack, Elizabeth Perkins, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!  <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!  <br />In short, Must Love Dogs is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  4.5 Stars <br />
B00005ASOI|5.0|Every time that I watch this masterpiece I am reminded why I have named it the finest horror film ever made! This is the story of an American student who goes to Europe to attend a prestigious dance academy. From the time she arrives strange things keep happening which spark her curiosity. What she finds is that the academy is run by a coven of witches and lead by one of the three mothers. The story however, isn't all that important. It is the combination of camera movement, visuals and sountrack that set this movie apart from anything filmed before or since! Each scene leaves me breathless with is master strokes. Dario Argento proves that he is one of the finest directors of our time. Goblin creates a score which makes a cab ride in the rain a terrifying experience. If you have not seen this, run out right now and get the uncut version!  Review taken from my movie review blog at [...]
0385338694|3.0|Having dropped off the chick lit bandwagon some years ago, I still pick one up once in a while, and Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic series has always (well, almost always) been a fun distraction from life and the daily grind. The Undomestic Goddess aka Samantha Sweeting follows in the footsteps of Kinsella's other 20-30something heroines. She is sweet, and we basically like her, even though she has major flaws. Samantha is a lawyer with a big firm, until an unbelievable mistake has her running blindly from the office, very much disgraced, being called a liability and fallen from her pedestal. Next she finds herself in the English countryside, where she takes a job as a housekeeper with a rich and nice middleaged couple, even though she doesn't know a saucepan from a vacuumcleaner. Here she meets the handsome gardener Nathaniel, his mother, the people at the local pub etc, and she finds out, that the cosy and slow moving life suits her much better than the workaholic life she led - and left - in London. But the question is, whether it is once a lawyer always a lawyer for Samantha, or if she will be able to settle for peace and quiet? The book is well written with lots of fun and charming situations, but I'd say that Kinsella has milked the chick lit cow enough now, and her heroines, charming and cute as they are, need to grow up.
B000FTWB7G|2.0|Fallen is IMO one of the best albums ever -- a rare one where I find all the tracks enjoyable. I'm still far from fully understanding why I don't like The Open Door nearly as much, but there's one thing I noticed, and that's that I have to strain to understand what Amy Lee is singing. This is probably a major part of it. In Fallen I could enjoy the words, and I could enjoy her voice. In The Open Door it's all somehow drowned, by either the music or the effects, or at times it just seems she's whispering. In Fallen her voice was also overlayed with stuff, but at least she seemed to make an effort to rise above it, or perhaps whoever edited it seemed to realise that her voice should be heard.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|I enjoyed the first season and got it. Eagerly awaiting season 2. See it for sale overseas in the UK but not here? Tough waiting so long...sigh. I can do other formats besides North America but it's a pain. C'mon guys, I'd rather spend the money here.
B000HT386M|3.0|Ok, who belives that any character that Sandler plays would land a fox like Beckinsale?
B00005JNX0|4.0|Described as an animated SEINFELD for kids, MADAGASCAR revolves around the lives of a quartet of animals from New York's Central Park Zoo. Marty (Chris Rock) is a zebra that after his 10th birthday suffers from a mid-life crisis and wants to be free. His closest friends; Alex (Ben Stiller) the lion, Melman (David Schwimmer--doing his best acting of his career) the giraffe, and Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) the Hippo try to get him to see how good their life is, but Marty just can't be convinced. He breaks out, as do the zoo's penguins, and tries to get to Africa. Instead, they end up on a Pacific isle somewhere that is largely inhabited by lemurs. The friendship between the quartet becomes estranged but faces the ultimate test when Alex (in an idea stolen from Bruce the Shark in Pixar's FINDING NEMO) begins giving into his carnal instincts and attacks Marty. Can a lion and zebra, two natural enemies, remain friends when they are no longer confined to captivity?<br /><br />With that said, they real reason you want to see MADAGASCAR is because of the penguins. The penguins who escape from the zoo are a top-notch unit of military commandos. They seem to have been original put in the film for comic relief, but upstage all the other characters and are the real stars of this animated flick. Another secondary character worth mentioning is the lemur king, Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen). Cohen has been a popular comedienne only known to a small audience for many years. MADAGASCAR opened his talents to a wider audience and paved the wave for his further success as the villain in TALLADEGA NIGHTS. MADAGASCAR may become known as the breakout film for Cohen.<br /><br />Though it's not quite on the level of a Pixar picture or the SHREK films, MADAGASCAR is better than much of the animated drivel that the studios are mass-producing currently. Children are sure to enjoy it and it has plenty of allusions and references as well as a decent soundtrack to keep adults entertained, too.
B000E6UWE4|4.0|This novel, as others have noted, seems to drag the first half of the book, to such a degree that a few times I considered what else I had to read rather than continue with this book.  Various characters are introduced, but for the most part have non-intersecting parts in the story.    With 'page 224' as some say, this begins to change and actual inter-character conflict begins.  The novel becomes far more interesting, and I had trouble putting this one down to get much-needed sleep.    The magical system depicted here is something I haven't run into elsewhere, but does seem to follow at least some rules and have some limitations, though in practical terms readers really see no difference between one warren and another - the author has stated that he has kept the warrens and magical system intentionally vague.  Participation of gods or demigods seemed a bit whimsical or plot-oriented but I will reserve judgement for now.  There are so many factions involved, each with their own, often undescribed, powers and motives, that much remains unclear at the end of this story.    Obviously this is the first in what is planned to be a fairly long series (at least 6 books now) so I can only hope the author doesn't/hasn't fallen into the never-ending story trap some prominent fantasy authors have discovered (the trap is for readers, the authors probably do quite well with it).    IF you are reading this for the first time, at least get into the story beyond page 224 before condemning it totally.  It gets a lot more interesting.    I picked this novel up after reading Glen Cook saying he enjoyed it in an interview.
B000002KMY|4.0|I AM RONNIE JAMES DIO. I am a sawed-off guinea runt from New Hampshire with poodle hair, and by rights I should installing car stereos in Perth Amboy. <br /> <br />But through some strange calculus, I have been made lead singer of Black bloody Sabbath. I have Geezer Butler and the mighty Tony Iommi at my call. I also somehow ended up with Carmen Appice from Vanilla Fudge's BROTHER on drums, but hey, you can't have everything. <br /> <br />I was Ritchie Blackmore's valet in Rainbow, and I will be subjecting the world to middling synthesizer Dungeons and Dragons metal by mid-decade, so this is my Lawnmower Man moment. I AM GOD HERE. And so I am going to claw at the sunlight and gulp the sweet air like an escaped Man in an Iron Mask. <br /> <br />So sit back and share this fleeting moment when I totally give myself over to my moment of shrieking like Shiva over Iommi's detuned Panzer assault. <br /> <br />Best tracks:  <br /> <br />1.

B00005JPB4|1.0|I had been looking forward to FLAGS OF OUR FATHTERS with great anticipation after reading the fantastic, engrossing book on which the film is based. When I was offered the opportunity to attend a sneak preview of the film, I jumped at the chance.<br /><br />FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS, the motion picture, is a tremendous disappointment. The battle scenes on Iwo Jima are extremely well done, but that's it. Unlike the chronological order of the book, which follows the flagraisers from their young adulthood through the battle and their deaths, the film is done in a continuous series of flashbacks and flashforwards, from the battle to the subsequent Bond Tour in the States and back, making it extremely hard to follow the story.<br /><br />There is little if any character development (in fact, the three flagraisers who later died on Iwo were barely part of the story), unlike the book, where you felt as if you knew each of the characters personally. Some incidents are shamelessly exploited and exaggerated for dramatic effect, and there are lots of little things that add up to major annoyances that detract from the film, such as the Rene Gagnon character having no northern New England accent. (That said, the actor who portrayed Gagnon looked eerily like the real-life Marine's photos).<br /><br />Worst of all, the screenplay took the very quiet, poignant moment of the author's final visit with his dying father and turned it into a piece of overblown, overwrought piece of Hollwood garbage to conclude the film. I'm surprised James Bradley allowed this to happen.<br /><br />If you want to truly get the feeling of what the men who invaded Iwo Jima went through, read the book FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS, and forget this overhyped, highly forgettable motion picture.
B00004SW9R|4.0|Even as New Orleans slowly pokes through Le Noveau Swamp, you know Dr. John, Le Grand Zombie himself, is out there. He never left.  The Gris-gris Man is riding around out there in a jewel encrusted Gondola, looking like a zombie pimp in three inch cuban heels. <br /> <br />This CD is Dr. John's CV. It busts a funky mandolin and moves at the speed of a summertime sewer. It goes slow, you meet some strange and groovy people and sometimes it just plain gives you the junkie fear.  <br /> <br />Don't listen to it alone. Because Dr. John may come a-calling with his Mojo bag.  <br /> <br />Creepy, funky, strange and beautiful music.
0312330537|1.0|Unfotrunately Shantaram did not grab my imagination at all.  Nor did I find it emotionally satisfying.  I realize Shataram is meant to be a kind of Bollywood story - over the top, flowery, cliched etc. but the Bollywood movies I've seen have been engaging and strangely satisfying, despite their soppyness etc.  Shantaram was not engaging because the poor writing and shallow characters spoil the story.
B000000OAA|4.0|This is what I know about Brian May: <br /> <br />1. Looks like Howard Stern <br />2. Actually holds a honors degree in Physics. HONORS. <br />3. Built the guitar he plays, which may or may not be called Red Sonya, Clifford the Big Red Dog, The Red Army Chorus or something else with RED in it. But red is the important thing, the name definately has \\"red\\" in it. Red's Java Hut? Simply Red? The Big Red One? <br /> <br />The reason I say this is that I get the sense that May loves this Red of his, as evidenced by the obsessive overdubs, of which there are six billion (Example: The EXCELLENT song Brighton Rock. This song is overdubbed like Dolly Parton has lower back pain). He just wants to play guitar so bad, that he does it almost to the point of overkill...and it sounds great.  <br /> <br />Like \\"It feels so good to appergio on this red guitar that I built with my highly trained scientific hands, that I will continue appergio-ing until I am done, at which point I will merely start all over again. I will then layer these appergios until it sounds like the fluttering of a butterfly the size of RODAN.\\" And of course, his playing is great. Brian May does not play in The Replacements. <br /> <br />So, he appergios for weeks: bidda, bidda. In the waiting room at the dentist, at dinner parties. He shows up at rehearsal: \\"Here, Roger, put some drum tracks under this.\\" Roger plays some crazy fills. Freddy sings some silliness in falsetto and a STONE COLD JAM IS BORN. <br /> <br />Fan/consumer annoyance point with the album \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\": the song \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" is not actually on this album. It's on \\"News of the World\\". What the heck?

B000G75AE8|4.0|\\"Religion is rape. Religion is obscene. Religion's <br />a whore!\\"So says Slayer on the track \\"Cult\\". Of course, <br />Mr. Ainsworth told us pretty much the same thing one <br />Spring morning on the way to a Peewee Soccer game. But <br />Mr. Ainsworth was driving a station wagon, he smoked <br />Mores, and had a scalp-showing-flat-top. His delivery <br />lacked frisson. Slayer, god bless 'em, has built a <br />career on god-hating frisson. Of course, at this point <br />the guys could be Mr. Ainsworth, all beefy men in <br />their mid-forties. But they haven't reached their <br />\\"Hello, Cleveland\\"moment yet. Monster cuts like <br />\\"Supremist\\" and \\"Jihad\\" deliver old school <br />mayhem like a kick to the yarbles -- thanks in no <br />small part to the return of the double-bass fury of <br />original drummer Dave Lombardo. So, up with Satan! We <br />have a solid, if predictable, Slayer product.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|If you are an Eagles fan and you have not yet seen the Eagles Farewell Tour I, then you are missing out. I have seen this particular tour 3 times so far (live) and this dvd is actually a little better than the performances that I witnessed. I attribute it to the lack of echoes in the dvd that seemed to be so prevalent in the live concerts.  <br /> <br />Walsh and Henley are in top form and are the stars of the show. Guitar enthusiasts please note: that in my opinion Felder is much missed. While his replacement Smith can technically play the notes/riffs, there seems to be something missing from Smith's style when compared directly to Felder. I found myself thinking of Felder too much during the concert, especially during the slower songs. But by and large, without a direct comparison to Felder, Smith does a great job.  <br /> <br />Overall, the negatives are very minor and the Eagles still put on one heck of a show. The harmonies & songs are excellent and the dvd quality is superb. While it seems that the songs skew a little bit more rock oriented than some fans are used to, there is a solid mixture of song styles to choose from. And the best part is that if you don't want to hear Walsh rock out like I do, its easy to skip on a dvd. I found myself really liking this concert.
B000056IKS|4.0|It's the first song, Hallogallo.  <br /> <br />And this is despite the song is ONLY ONE CHORD FOR TEN MINUTES over a obsessive 4/4 pulse. But this chord, this chord is special. This chord is fwacka-fwacka-fwacka'd up and down like taffy.  <br /> <br />I defy you... DEFY you... not to shake yer moneymaker just a little bit listening to this. It will make you pogo like an idiot.  <br /> <br />The rest of the album is good, in a Teuton-angsty noise kind of way, with a few pretty bits spaced throughout. But Hallogallo... Hallogallo is special.
B000000H5J|5.0|Loud, aggressive and above all precise to the last bit. A must have for anyone interested in this type of music. A true masterpiece!
B00005JPBP|3.0|(3 & 1/2 stars) Christopher Nolan has proven to be a director whose films are worth watching, intriguing works whether they succeed artistically (Memento) or fall short (Batman Begins).  The Prestige is another interesting effort from Nolan.  The story of rival magicians has many twists, turns and surprises - \\"expect the unexpected\\" could be the motto of the Prestige.  There were many things I enjoyed about this movie, but in the end it felt somewhat empty to me.  It's hard to define exactly why; perhaps it's the fact that it's come so soon after another historical magician movie, or maybe it was that all the jumping around in time made the story feel kind of dissociated.  The acting by Jackman & Bale was reasonably good, and Michael Caine and David Bowie were both entertaining in their roles.  (I found Bowie's Tesla to be particularly fascinating.)  However, I felt Scarlett Johansson's talent was wasted in her part as the magician's assistant.  Some of the visuals were cool, mainly all the electrical stuff, but the storytelling was too disconnected for the movie to work for me overall.
0060599847|4.0|I got the audio version of this book to listen to during my commute to work.<br /><br />------<br /><br />The good things about this book:<br /><br />* It's quite long and even in abridged audio form there is lots of material.<br /><br />*Unlike some books and audio books, the material is given a good airing but not laboured over.<br /><br />*It contains some practical advice that could be applied to different areas of life, including business.<br /><br />The not so great thing about this book:<br /><br />*I think in a couple of cases the author could have chosen better examples to illustrate his points.<br /><br />One suggestion, very briefly, is that if the family dogs are out of control, then you should sell them or give them away.<br /><br />I appreciate this is only an example, but considering it is mentioned in a section about taking full responsibility in your life, I'd say that selling or giving away your pets if they aren't behaving is not a great example.<br /><br />Therefore I'd ask Mr Canfield and his publisher to change this in any future updated version of the book to urge readers with misbehaving dogs to \\"train or take those dogs to an animal behaviourist\\".<br /><br />------<br /><br />Overall, this is easy to listen to, interesting and does give you ideas and inspiration.<br /><br />This is definitely on the more fluffy and feel-good side of anything I'd consider reading or listening to, but unlike many books in the field of self-development it does contain a lot of varied material and does not constantly repeat the same basic idea over and over again.
B000068FY0|5.0|Through the history of rock, a handful of albums are considered turning points.  Most are large points in time.  But a handful of albums are a bit more specialized in how they influenced the future of music.  \\"Crime Of The Century\\" is just such an album.  Until this album, progressive rock had been either loud and rambling, as bands like Deep Purple and Black Sabbath were exploring, or long soaring journeys like Yes and King Crimson developed.  At this stage, no band had taken simple pop songs and applied prog rock stylings to them.  \\"School\\", \\"Asylum\\" and \\"Crime Of The Century\\" are amazing, cornerstone songs that take simple pop melodies and turn them into something so much more than we had ever heard before.  Even the songs that are less fleshed out, like \\"Bloody Well Right\\", \\"Dreamer\\" and \\"Hide In Your Shell\\" are far more challenging lyrically than the other pop ditties of the 1970's.  For those who know Supertramp for their multi-platinum \\"Breakfast In America\\", parts of this less commercial album will be a surprise.  Make no mistake though - this album is an essential package that should be in every true music fan's collection.
0316172324|4.0|This book questions if believing in scientific research or gut instinct is the right thing to do.  The author talks candidly about his new Afro hairdo which brings him unwanted attention from the law, which questions if subconsciousness stereotypes our ethnicity.  Blink questions if incidents such as Rodney King bashing by the police or the shooting of Diallo in front of his house are due to racism or due to our mind not functioning rationally when we have very little time space to spare.  Subsequently, he questions if those \\"temporary insanity\\" is equivalent to people who has autism.  Then, there are also discussions about food, drinks, and music tasting and how focus groups would have gotten them so wrong.  The author continues to add that people know what they know when they like or dislike something but when they are told to justify why they like or dislike certain things, that's when things get pear-shaped.  Does that mean just because we aren't able to justify things constructively, those results are proved less useful?  We also then question if gut instinct is in fact a constructive symptom at the first place?  There are also many illustrations about face reading, body reading and the author endeavours to justify that if we hone in our critical assessments of those subtle clues, maybe, we are able to \\"educate\\" our subconscious to discern certain situations and circumstances which ordinay people aren't able to pick up.  This book is foremost thought-provoking and entices me to see things from a new dimension, or shall I say, a new paradigm shift.  It's entertaining and highly enjoyable to read.  Avid readers would appreciate that the author works with David Remnick who himself has written a few best sellers himself.
B000EQ47HC|4.0|So what DO you do after you've just establshed the record for the best-selling debut album of all time?  You either make a new record, or retire.  Being that the guys were still pretty young to retire, they made this altogether decent follow-up.  When you sell as many albums as \\"Boston\\" did, you know the fans - which were numerous - would want more of the same.  And Boston delivered what their fans wanted.  \\"Don't Look Back\\" and \\"Feelin' Satisfied\\" are fun, rocking romps that channelled the buoyant nature of \\"Peace Of Mind\\" and \\"Rock n Roll Band\\".  And Boston did progress a little bit - \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\" was the power ballad that didn't appear in any form on the debut album, and \\"Used To Bad News\\" - a personal favorite - had a slightly different style to it.  All in all, Boston doesn't take any steps forward with this release, but they didn't fall backwards either.

B0000025P9|5.0|\\"IV\\" won the Grammy for album of the year, giving them the respect at last that they so richly deserved.  This album is filled with the high quality mid-tempo tracks \\"Rosanna\\", \\"Make Believe\\" and \\"Africa\\", as well as the amazing ballad \\"I Won't Hold You Back\\" and the twin rockers \\"Afraid Of Love\\" and \\"Lovers In The Night\\".  This album has aged well and could easily have been just as successful in any generation.  I'm not sure to this day if I like the progressive Toto, the hard rocking Toto or the soulful Toto best.  I do know that the styles meshed perfectly here and caught the ear of the public once again - and Toto's numerous fans felt a sense of vindication from the band's critics at last.
B000002GFC|5.0|I have had this for several years now, and I still find it to be just the right amount of cream with none of the filler.  It has the ones you want, like I FEEL FREE, I'm So Glad, Strange Brew, Sunshine of You Love, Whiteroom, and Crossroads, plus a lot of other great tracks. This is still maintaining it's re-sale value, that is because people who get this don't sell it back, so you can't find it used. I'm likely going to play my CD to death, and then get another.  Check this out, good value to get your injection of Cream.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|It's an extremely rare album that plays, beginning to end, like no time has elapsed for 30 years.  This is just such an album.  There isn't a weak moment on this album, and the first five songs have been mainstays of classic rock for generations.  And the next three are far from unfamiliar to anyone who lived in the 70's and listened to rock stations.  There are probably a dozen or so classic rock albums that define the decade of the 1970's and to suggest that this is not one of them is laughable.  Boston may have become the poster child for how not to manage a music career, but for a handful of years, there was no better commercial rock band in existence than this one.
B000002U82|5.0|There is not much to say about this album that has not been said already.  It was the first of many albums that solidified the jump of the british psychadelic band pink floyd into the worldwide limelight, unsurpassed Jagernaut that it became.  It has a very timeless sound, and flows effortlessly from one song to another and just takes you through an unsurpassed journey from beginning to end.  Time, Money, Us and Them, and Brain Damage are my amongt my top 20 floyd songs of all time.  If you need to own one floyd album, it should be this album.  Pallatable to all old fans, and to new ones.
B000002O51|3.0|Due to mammoth contractual squabbles (a long-standing theme for Boston), it took 6 years for this album that began in 1980 (2 years after the release of \\"Don't Look Back\\")to reach completion.  But after 6 years of production, they couldn't produce more than 36 minutes of music?  And of the 36 minutes, 6 of it is either techno-instrumental filler or rewrites of existing songs (My Destination is a rewritten version of Amanda).  Some of the songs are extremely good though.  \\"Amanda\\" was a well-deserved hit and the only #1 song of their career.  \\"We're Ready\\" was a bit closer to a mid-tempo, softer sound that Boston had not explored previously.  \\"Cool The Engines\\" kept the catchy but heavy Boston sound alive, and \\"Hollyann\\" is a stellar ballad with a nostalgic tinge that suited Boston very well at this moment in their career.  But considering that there are really only 3 other actual new songs on this album, I truly have to say I expected more.  Do the math, that's about a song a year.  Not many bands can survive that level of output.
0316776963|4.0|Me Talk Pretty One Day is one-third amusing, one-third funny and one third absolutely laugh out loud hilarious. Whether retelling a story about his cussing brother, his experience with a speech therapist or a class of non-native speakers of French trying to explain Easter to a classmate, David Sedaris knows exactly what to focus on to hit a person right in the funny bone.  Although two of his previous novels, Barrel Fever and Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, contain stories with similar themes, they are not nearly as funny, maybe due to their tendency toward more restricted/adult themes.  Those who plan to give David Sedaris' humor a try should choose this one.
B000GY729M|3.0|I was expecting pretty much what I got from this album.  The Killers' first album was tremendous, a pop/rock classic in an age that's rejected the style.  Nearly single-handedly (okay, Franz Ferdinand helped), the Killers have brought power pop back to the mainstream.  In places, the band does try to take some style and songwriting steps forward, but they just seem to be a bit over their heads when they do it.  I have to hope that this doesn't sentence the band to the same fate as bands like Love And Rockets and Cutting Crew, who had a moment in the sun and promptly disappeared.  The best songs - \\"When You Were Young \\", \\"Bling\\", \\"Read My Mind\\" and \\"The River Is Wild\\" - are credible, but they don't break any new ground.  When the time comes to make their third album, the Killers need to be ready to explore new styles or they might not have a fourth chance with a major label.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|Am I the only one who is particularly in love with the second half of this record? The whole thing's great, but the \\"experimental\\" songs that everyone keeps bitching about and labeling as the chaff of the album are the one's I can't stop listening to. \\"Killing Lies\\" is such a handsome little song as it chugs along, and singing along with Julian belting \\"you're no fun\\" on the gloriously climactic chorus of \\"Fear of Sleep\\" has been some of the best catharsis I've gotten from a recording all year. And then there's \\"Ize of the World,\\" with it's great, deranged guitar intro and it's perfectly contrasting verse and chorus sections (the verses being calm, poppy crooning while the choruses sound like the band is suddenly performing on the top of a skyscraper watching Armageddon, all the while having their NYC cool intact... and anyone notice how the last line of the song is \\"cities to vaporize,\\" and the song cuts abruptly before the line is finished as to suggest that the city was literally destroyed during the recording... shut up, it's not cheesy) \\"15 Minutes\\" is stupendous as it changes from a drunken swagger to a double-time pep finale on a dime, and \\"Evening Sun\\" evokes the soothing sincerity of lullaby while still maintaining the essential energy of a rock song. And \\"Red Light,\\" wow! What a charming little finish to the album! That drumming is irresistable... I keep finding myself blasting this song before I go out at night. The Strokes aren't going to make 'Is This It' again, and they don't need to! Get over it! Yes, Julian's songwriting is expanding and becoming more adventurous- that's because it has to in order to reach the genuineness he and his band are aiming for (and in my mind, have achieved with this album.)
0684833395|5.0|So much has already been written about Catch 22 that I don't know if I can add anything else to the discussion.  It's well worth your time to read it if you haven't and reread it if it's been a while.<br /><br />The brilliance of the book, in my opinion, is that it maintains several themes strongly through sarcasm.  Reading the novel feels like watching a M*A*S*H marathon, that's high praise in my book.<br /><br />Power designs itself to remain in power and greed is the ultimate excuse for any crime.  Those out of power can be trampled upon and abused and killed so long as it's done in the name of greed - and that doesn't even need to be disguised.  And, the sad part is that it's all true.  There isn't any truth in this book that's less relevant today than when it was written 40 years ago.<br /><br />- CV Rick

B000EVQ572|5.0|This album pays homage to some of the greats and still manages to innovate into a new sound.  Listening from track to track, most people will be able to identify the influences of major rb/soul legends.  But I think that Van Hunt does a great job innovating (not replicating) upon the foundation of the music.  The versatility of Van Hunt shines very bright in this album.  I really enjoyed the first ablum.  But this album may be just a bit better.  Although, if you like the music...you will like both albums.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|i have followed maiden for 24 of my 35 years on this planet and have never been let down by what they do and this new record is no exception to that.  i look forward to many more listenings to this album and all of maidens records.  and i like janick and blaze as well as paul and clive or even dennis, janick still being with the band i must say i have always enjoyed him since he joined, and as for the others paul clive and blaze i loved them while they were a part of maiden and still try and follow them now.  dont know much about other past band members before say 1980 so i cant comment on them.  as for the current line up i hope they stay together for awhile and do some more records but if the lineup changes in future i will still give it a listen.  maiden like all the bands i have followed have changed over the years but i still enjoy what they do.  some of the other bands arent around anymore so up the irons.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Before this movie came out, I had never heard of Firefly.  I watched the movie on the recomendation of a friend, and I didn't really see what the big deal was.  To me it looked like a big screen version of any number of recent sci-fi television series...OK, but nothing spectacular.  After even more prodding, my friend got me to watch his DVDs of the television series.   <br /> <br />Although never really getting the opportunity to fulfill its promise, the series had an interesting premise and likable enough characters to prompt me to give the movie another view.   The added character developement of the series improved this movie immensely for me.  It added an immeasurable degree of emotional depth to the story, and when when it was over I could finally see what all the fuss was about.   <br /> <br />Taken together, the series and film work nicely together to create what is perhaps the most compelling space opera in recent memory.  I look forward to future installments in this franchise be they on the big or small screen.   <br /> <br />My advice to you is to familiarize yourself with the series first.  While most people will tell you that it really isn't necessary to enjoy the film, the added context it provides is well worth the extra effort.
B00005JPBR|3.0|I'll keep this short and to the point: the acting was terrific, the casting superb.  The ending, however, was a cop-out; it was the ending that I told myself couldn't be, purely because of it's utter impausibility.   <br />**Spoiler Warning** <br /> <br />I wanted a logical explanation and got a cripplingly easy answer instead. <br /> <br />**End Spoiler Warning** <br /> <br />Too bad.

B00005JPBP|4.0|I had really great expectations for this film and I was looking forward to see it, especially after I saw 'The Illusionist' recently. Too bad that my expectations for this flick weren't met, ... and that doesn't mean this movie is bad as in fact, it is a very good movie. The acting by Caine, Jackman and Bale is just superb, and the mood is very well captured. <br />One thing that bothered me though was that the apparently bad guy (played by Bale) seems to be favored. When you watch this motion picture, you have to think and concentrate as in a sense from the makeup it's almost a type of Sherlock Holmes mystery although there isn't a detective in sight ... it's just a mystery with a suprising final. <br />Now did I like this movie better than 'The Illusionist'? Can't say, although I have a tendency to favor 'The Illusionist' but I guess both films are well worth watching as both films have their surprises, excellent acting, great mood capturing with good photography. <br />It was refreshing to see David Bowie in 'The Prestige' and too bad he hasn't been in too many films throughout his life as he's an excellent actor too. <br />If the interest is predominantly in magic and the ultimate tricks and illusions, then most Criss Angel episodes will be more interesting and do it more justice in this regard than both of these films. But again, 'The Prestige' as well as 'The Illusionists' are very good films and are enjoyable.
0307237699|5.0|For any American citizen who is currently in resignation or despair over the abundant examples of unethical, immoral and abusive leaders who breed cynicism and apathy,  The Audacity of Hope is a breath of much needed oxygen. Senator Obama may be considered \\"soft\\" by the media who enjoy taking down anyone who exhibits complexity of mind, paradoxical thinking and humanistic values, yet his writing inspires one to stop wallowing in helplessness and take an active role in our imperfect democracy.  When Obama first spoke at the Democratic convention, Ann Deavere Smith wrote an op ed piece the next day saying that politics would never be the same because finally a leader spoke with a \\"unifying fusion\\" beyond partisanship, stereotypes and blame mongering.  The senator's writing demonstrates that reflective, thoughtful consideration of apparent opposites is a leadership attribute needed urgently -- Obama speaks of the need to redefine power from its corrupt, controlling misuse as currently witnessed daily to an inclusive power that practices empathy, tolerance, and a reclaiming of core democratic values.  Obama leaves the reader with a call to face our critical global issues by polishing the lens of our own perceptions rather than projecting and perpetuating fear and hatred.  Whether he will be able to pass great legislation or run for president,  this book provides inspiration to any leader who wants to demonstrate a capacity to connect with the hearts, minds and souls of generations seeking to be inspired and uplifted.  He embodies the true sense of enlightened -\\"awake\\" not perfect--able to use his intelligence for the greater good while demonstrating the humility of one who knows his own shadows.  A highly recommended read for all would be leaders.
B000HA4WT8|1.0|While some movies require that you throw out your disbelief, I had a very hard time doing so with this movie.  This movie was just plain stupid.  They should have kept this film story in the states.  Once everything moves over to Tokyo, the film plummets into inauthenticity the likes of which I haven't seen in a long time.  I would have respected the film 1,000 times more had it ended when the main character goes to Japan.    So let's get this straight, Japanese high school students act like American high school students?  Lucas Black's character is simply told to go to a Japanese high school where he will simply pick up the language and make do?  Everybody speaks English ? His father lives in a tiny apartment yet has a garage that's about double the size of his apartment?    I would have much preferred subtitles and a story that felt, looked and sounded more Japanese.  Japanese students are among some of the most polite students you will ever meet.  The Japanese culture is steeped and immersed in being respectful, polite and dutiful.  Real Japanese high school students would be embarassed by the way their culture was represented here.  Actually they probably wouldn't be embarassed, they would laugh at the film's poor attempt in showing true or even remotely true Japanese culture.  Japanese culture is not steeped in American hiphop and egocentric behavior and it's a pity so many Americans will see this film and actually think that Japanese students are just like American students.  There would be nothing further from the truth.  Japanese students do not act, look or sound like what was filmed here.  Not by a long shot.    Given my dislike of how the Japanese culture was handled in this film, it left me finding the plot irrelevant.  The plot was OK but it would have been much better if they had either stuck to a more authentic representation of Japanese culture or kept the story in the states.
B00001U0E1|5.0|Wonderful, witty, beguiling; touching and true. Utterly brilliant script, direction, acting. Pure light entertainment, humour and sadness. A deep understanding of Shakespearean stage-craft and the practical realities of Elizabethan London, and delightful in every way. A summing-up of one of life's first lessons: the grave is most men's wedding-bed, and why this knowledge forms the spur to creativity.     Equally staggering is the hate-mail that this masterpiece has collected at the bottom end of the reviewing scale. Stupefying, to think that anyone claiming human intelligence would prefer some flag-waving trash called, what was it? Has Anyone Here Seen Kelly? --- which was aimed at apemen, well below the civilization threshold --- in the Oscar awards. This scintillating film has even gone some way to restoring my faith in the panel's mental competence. Although perhaps Mabel, the pirate's daughter, would have been a better name than Ethel.

B000002KCI|3.0|It's funny, since Zuma is probably the closest thing to a traditional rock album Mr. Young's done (a TRULY traditional rock album would be impossible for this guy), you'd think I like it more than I do. Don't get me wrong, there's good stuff here. But too often the guy settles for mediocrity.<br /><br />First, the good. Cortez the Killer is my favorite here, the song friggin' rocks, a lengthy guitar jam a la Down By the River, Cowgirl in the Sand and the then-upcoming Like a Hurricane. I've heard some people don't like Neil's guitar playing, I say listen to this one and you'll get blown away. If the three-and-a-half minute intro doesn't grab you, you're not a Neil Young fan. What else is good? My second favorite song is Barstool Blues, another great rock song. Plus I like Don't Cry No Tears and the other long guitar showpiece, Danger Bird.<br /><br />But the rest isn't quite up to the Neil Young Standard. He often settles for generic love songs (a la Pardon My Heart and Lookin' for a Love). Either that, or he suddenly becomes immature (Stupid Girl, which is, well... stupid). Through My Sails has some nice harmonies, being CSN related, but it's not much outside of that, and Drive Back is a generic rocker saved only by Neil's guitar fireworks.<br /><br />It's a respectable album, far better than the vastly overrated Harvest and spotty debut. But compared to On the Beach, After the Gold Rush, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere or Tonight's the Night, it falls apart. I suppose you should buy it, just don't expect anything near a masterpiece.
B000E97Y6K|2.0|I'm not a big fan of overhyped multi-hour sloughs through Hollywood bloat.  The original film was way better than this and it was half the time. I thought the casting was excellent, except for Jack Black.  I'm a fan of his work, but he seemed really out of place in this movie.  I hated the dinosaurs and the giant insect sequences that didn't seem to ever end.  The bizarre love triangle between girl-big gorilla-boy was toned down quite a bit from the 77 version, but still felt out of place.  However, my biggest gripe of this movie is why did it need to be three hours.  I did not see anything in this version that wasn't in the original or the remake in 77 that suggested it should last three hours.  I understand that there is an extended version, of what, Naomi Watts trimming her toenails, or Jack Black throwing back a couple at the local bar.  Maybe Peter Jackson, fresh from finishing the superb Lord Of the Rings trilogy, can't make a movie anymore that comes in under three hours.  There are movies that deserve a three hour treatment because the subject matter is so complex or interesting, King Kong was not one of them.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|The opening sequence in this film is so exhilaratingly beautiful, it brings tears to my eyes every time I watch. Princess Nausica&auml; is the very epitome of the Studio Ghibli / Hayao Miyazaki ideal - a strong, spirited, rational, intelligent, compassionate and gentle young woman, who dominates the film.<br /><br />We find ourselves a thousand years in the future and an earlier global war has made almost all of the earth uninhabitable by humans. Various despotic and rogue states vie with each other for the meagre resources and habitable spaces left for mankind. Remnants of an earlier highwe level of technology are left over, but most of the what is left of the human race has reverted back to a pseudo-Medieval state, with its associated level of technology. Mutated insects and plants now rule the earth.<br /><br />The film is also a morality tale and a warning about our treatment of the world in which we live. Yes, it is an animation, well, an Anim&eacute;, actually!, but it is a film probably better suited to older children, teenagers and adults.<br /><br />Nausica&auml;: Valley Of The Wind is a sustained and powerful film from the master film maker, Hayao Miyazaki. You should see it at least once!
B000GG4XJM|4.0|I have a great love for this whole Seeger Sessions project. When it first came out I felt it was an essential Springsteen project because he brought these songs back under our attention, with a potential to reach a market of millions. I admired the political stance the project seemed to breathe and Springsteen displayed during the subsequent tour. I also liked the looseness of the project. Springsteen, a perfectionist, usually tends to overwork his material in the studio. On this project he suddenly sounded more spontaneous than he ever did on a record. But as the tour showed, the Seeger Session continued to be a work in progress. Bring em Home, How Can a Poor Man and American Land were (partly) penned during the tour, the first two songs initially available through his website. So in some way it makes sense that this revised version hit the market. <br /> <br />Yet a few things bother me about the project though. The first thing is musically, How Can a Poor Man fitted the feel of his live shows, but seems a bit of here on the album. The sequencing of the tracks also seems of with the new songs. American Land sounds like an opener not as a bonus track. Then there is the sudden extra footage in the documentary which gives this new edition the air of a commercial choice. As a fan who was there the minute the product hit the market I always tend to feel a bit cheated when editions like this one follow the initial release. Fortunately most of the material here is available though alternate canals. The five bonus tracks and videos can be purchased through Itunes. The documentary was broadcast through the Country Music Channel, available on DVD through fan trading forums on the net. For the expanded liner note I'll refer to the official Springsteen site. If you're new to the project I'd strongly recommend picking this edition up. It truly is a five star project, I subtracted just the one because I feel he should've given us the material first time round or released it differently. A DVD from one of the shows and an American Land single release would've been a better strategy if you ask me. Marketing wise and for the fans.
B0006J28BO|5.0|I love all the Studio Ghibli films and this one was one of the first I bought. I cannot say how well the American release stacks up against the superb Australian release on the Madman label ([...]).<br /><br />This work really is quite magical and it is a story unlike anything from Disney and it is told in a way unlike anything from Disney. As with all the Studio Ghibli films, Morita presents us with a strong central female character, caught up in fantastic events going on around her.<br /><br />The work is a fantasy and yet it resonated with me on a number of levels. The character of the Baron was a superb creation and we first met him in Whisper Of The Heart, another simply beautiful film.<br /><br />I recommend this film to all ages, from 8 year olds to 80 year olds.<br /><br />I am in my 40s and I love this film!<br /><br />PS: Excellent orchestral score for this work, too. The CD of the soundtrack would be worth investigating.
B000HT386M|3.0|I think the previous reviews make good points, and I agree with them.  <br />My review is about the DVD menu screens which are utterly annoying and yet can't be avoided. What is this new hobby now with DVD movies, these horrible unavoidable screens that make it feel that there are razors slicing your eyeballs. I didn't even watch the extra features to avoid any more of this abuse. I'm glad that I only rented it and will promplty return it.  <br />
B00005JPB4|4.0|\\"Flags of Our Fathers,\\" above all else, is the story behind what author James Bradley calls \\"The Photograph.\\"  Six Marines are forever immortalized when they're caught on film raising the American flag to mark the capture of Iwo Jima's Mount Suribachi, the island's strategic high ground.<br /><br />Recognizing the iconic appeal of this incredibly heroic image, at a time when financial support for the war effort is failing, the U.S. Government decides to ride this picture for all it's worth, dispatching the three surviving flag raisers on a grueling nationwide tour to promote war bonds.  The problem is that reality cannot possibly live up to this icon of heroism, a truth the movie gradually reveals by flashing backward and forward between footage of the Iwo Jima battle, the bond tour, and the research into these events conducted years later by the son of one of the three soldiers, medic John (Doc) Bradley (played with perfect understatement by Ryan Phillipe).<br /><br />As is turns out, the flag captured in the picture is not the first flag raised, but rather a substituted decoy that allows the Marines to ensure that an opportunistic politician doesn't get his hands on the original.  There also are conflicting accounts as to the identity of the dead soldiers in the picture, creating unbearable angst among the surviving family members.  And what's worse, from the perspective of the three surviving soldiers, is the powerful sense that they are unworthy of the hero labels attached to them, knowing in their hearts that the real heroes of Iwo Jima are their thousands of fallen comrades.<br /><br />Each of the three bears his shame differently.  Doc Bradley carries on in quiet, stoic pain, the essence of the Eastwood hero, unwilling to talk about what happened even with his own family.  Ira Hayes (Adam Beach) turns to excessive drink, threatening to become an embarrassment to the Government's well-orchestrated bond campaign.  And Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford), the extroverted face man, becomes utterly consumed by the publicity, leaving an empty shell of a man who's quickly discarded once his time in the sun has passed.<br /><br />While the film accomplishes what it sets out to do, analyzing this powerful icon and what it reveals about heroism, I wouldn't call it Eastwood's best work.  It felt rushed to me in places, as the rapid flitting between different time periods made it hard to flesh out the characters or achieve a distinct point of view.  In that sense it's almost the antithesis of the linear, focused plotting in my favorite Eastwood movie, \\"Unforgiven.\\" Yet this film, with its brutally-realistic battle scenes and historically-authentic feel, is sure to take its place alongside \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" as one of the most powerful and moving films commemorating the Second World War.<br /><br />-Kevin Joseph, author of \\"The Champion Maker\\"erly consumed by the publicity, leaving an empty shell of a man who's quickly discarded once his time in the sun has passed.

0618680004|3.0|Here is a question for Mr. Dawkins and atheists everywhere.  Does a lobster, which has never been to the surace of the ocean, have the capacity to see or experience water?  Since water always was and always is to the lobster, isn't it reasonable to assume the lobster would never develop a capacity to experience water?  Would the lobster's inability to experience water supply any evidence that water itself does not exist?  Or is the lobster's inability to experience water physical evidence of the omnipresence of water to the lobster?  Perhaps Mr. Dawkins writing a book on the delusion of God is the equivalent of a lobster writing a book on the delusion of water.  Perhaps Mr. Dawkins incapicity to experience a personal relationship with God supplies us physical evidence of the ominipresence of God.  Perhaps as the Bible says, God is, was and always will be.
B00005JKC3|4.0|Based on critical reviews of The Hulk, I was prepared to hate it. I put off viewing the film for a long time because I believed that it was a poor film. WRONG! The special effect of the Hulk is terrific. The storyline is excellent. Casting is great, featuring Sam Elliott and Nick Nolte in striking roles. This is a long film -- 2 hrs. 18 min., but it doesn't feel like a long movie. Highly recommended.
B000HIVQK8|3.0|One thing that really annoys me about reissues is the tacking-on of extra tracks which weren't in the artist's original conception of the album.  With the \\"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\\" MFSL gold CD, for instance, the \\"Power to the People\\" single was added, which completely detracted from the album, being in a different style and coming after the finale of the original. <br /> <br />With this one, these tracks (and the studio version of \\"Bangla Desh\\" should have been included too) could have been added to the bonus disc just as easily, giving it more length while preserving the integrity of the original... <br /> <br />Oh well.  It's not a bad album in itself, but tends to be a bit bland in comparison to most of his other work.  Great packaging to the LP, but the songs just lack the power of \\"All Things must pass\\".  To me, it even ranks lower than \\"Extra Texture\\" among his 1970s work.
0312330529|5.0|I found this book hard to put down! Gregory David Roberts is a writer with a wonderful way of words and poetry of soul. I found so much humanity in his writing in spite of the often violent and gory scenarios he depicts. I left the book feeling I had met an amazing human being who survived his own particular journey and came out of it with his heart somehow still intact.I know India and have published a novel based on my own very different experiences there. I salute you and thank you for a wonderful read. Blessings
B00008K7AM|5.0|I tuned in to this movie thinking it would just be another half-funny slapstick movie, but how wrong could I be? This is one of the funniest movies I have seen. Even sitting here alone I was laughing uncontrollably. Rob Schneider was great but so were all the other characters. The humour was very clever and very well delivered. I'm adding this one to my collection. <br />
B0002CHIJW|5.0|There is no justification for making such a rotten and loathesome movie. With the notable exception of the 2002 underground film \\"They All Must Die!\\" which was banned worldwide, I Spit On Your Grave has to contain the most graphic and heinous rape scene in the history of film. I am not even sure why I bought it. If the director wanted to make a point that rape is terrible, he made it. And I came away from this film feeling dirty about being a man. I guess any movie that can make me feel something (good or bad) is worth its while. I hate to say it... but, it was interesting, for the most part, and I recommend that everyone sees it.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|After seeing the first two films in the \\"X-Men\\" series, I was wary to see the latest installment. The first film was alright, and the second was just average. So, my hopes for this third installment in the franchise were far from optimistic.<br /><br />But, after viewing the film, I was pleasently surprised. \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\" is, without a doubt, the best \\"X-Men\\" film so far. It has a great combination of action, visual effects, acting and storytelling that bring the series to a fantastic, probable conclusion, although it does hint at the possibility of future films in the franchise!<br /><br />While the film does have its faults, and it doesn't strictly adhere to the comic book, it is a fantastic film that belongs in anyone's collection of comic-book films!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A
B000FVQM2Y|2.0|I thought that this movie sucked. It seems like a movie made by someone who took all his favorite noir movies and rolled them into one. For an added zinger, they decided to set it in a High School which I just can't swallow. It is the high school thing that gets me, it's so unrealistic it just loses me. And I get the idea that it's supposed to be semi-satire but it doesn't work for me and in my opinion just ends up being corny not clever
B00005JNDZ|2.0|<br />The film, and I guess the book, suffers from being the sequel of what was an unexpected success. Tired, lacking the increasing maturity that one may expect from years added to a girl's journey through life and rushed into making an awful gaff. <br /> <br />There is one scene which the writer and film maker will come to regret. Obviously based on a real life, recently the subject of a UK TV series 'Banged-up' overseas, now the subject of a harrowing autobiography and presumably an equally harrowing film to be. Being dumb enough to become an unwitting drug mule, the suggestion that a Bangkok women's jail could be fun is deeply disturbing. The forthcoming docudrama about Golden Gate suicides is already being criticised for the risk of encouraging such suicides. That film may be able to defend itself, but the Bridget Jones sequel cannot. It is on the edge of reason.    <br /> <br />Had the film makers included the scene cut but available on CD, then the Bangkok sequence may have been believable. However it is far too great a suspension of reality to believe that any government and international human rights lawyer, could remain in love with someone whose actions threatened  his career, self concept and family happiness. <br /> <br />The book, the film could have been a 'great' and a great tear-jerker, if the plot had matured closer to reality.  <br /> <br />just Jack
0618680004|4.0|If you've read any of the reviews here, you'll notice that most of the negative reviews are submitted by reviewers who have obviously not read the book or are simply responding to the title of the book or the name of the author, given his stand on the subject of religion.     As a Christian, I looked into the history of \\"The Word of God\\" and I saw the hand of man.  I looked into the scripture and saw not the works of an all-knowing, all-seeing and loving god, but the works of a society dominated by men which relied on mythology which held that women are possessions that brutality against any \\"outside\\" group is acceptable.    One need only read Leviticus to see just how the Bible was constructed by man.     This book is a companion in many aspects to the PROFOUND television series that Dawkins put together called \\"Root of all Evil?\\" in which he takes the gloves off and responds to the Religious Fundamentalist war against science.  I highly recommend finding this series though it's not available in retail outlets, but is floating around on the 'net.     Since the positives are covered rather well in other reviews, I'll address the one REAL flaw in The God Delusion, and that is Dawkin's assumption that the American people are building toward a Christian fundamentalist theocracy.     Yes, Atheists are the most hated \\"people\\" in the United States at the moment according to polls, and yes, the President is a Christian and does \\"talk to god\\" (i.e. pray) but Dawkins doesn't spend enough time in the states or out amongst the people of the States to know that, if anything, the opposite is true.     Radical Atheists are attacking the traditions of this nation.  Remember that I say this as an Atheist who believes that there is no god.  From demanding that crosses be removed from national cemeteries to demanding that Christmas be abandoned and renamed the \\"Holiday season,\\" to Government schools not allowing children to sing \\"God Bless America.\\"     Do we have a lot of fundamentalists?  Sure, but we're making progress in America.  That is the reasoning behind the recent offensive by the fundamentalists to toss out Darwin and embrace ID.       Dawkins Imagines an America that is just about as bad as Afghanistan during the Taliban.  When the Fundamentalists start beheading people for sinning, start strapping bombs to themselves and blowing up civilian targets such as malls, and refusing to move forward in favor of living in the stone ages, we'll talk.  Until then, it's a stretch that only an aloof European resident with little or no knowledge of the American Society could make.     When Fundamentalists took over a Pennsylvania School board and tried to force creationism down the throats of the people of Pennsylvania, they were voted out of office by a landslide.  When an Alabama judge refused to obey an order to remove a MASSIVE monument of the Ten Commandments from Federal Property, he was removed from the bench and the monument went with him.     Other than this one glaring flaw, the God Delusion is an AWESOME work that I recommend to EVERYONE, religious or not.  If you are an atheist, then this will affirm your conclusions and even open your eyes to new conclusions to be made.  If you are a religious person, I urge you to read this with an open mind.  Blind faith in anything, especially in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary is holding MANY people back.  This book will at the very least force you to think and might even open your eyes to the fact that there is no God.    Note:  This review has been edited slightly.  I mistakenly included Kansas City as the town that sent fundamentalist School Board members packing.  It was Dover, PA.  Sorry about that.

B000GBEWHA|5.0|Yeah!  All those extra features are great...but, just get this for the frikkin T-Bird jacket!
B00004XPPK|3.0|I hate to be so myopic about it, but most critics agree. Gilda can best be remembered for Rita Heyworth's \\"Put The Blame On Mame\\" song and dance performance. I know some have described it as a stiptease with clothes on. You might say it's about as erotic as watchimg Elvis gyrate on The Ed Sullivan Show. That's just the point here. The flim is flawed primarily because its focus is on puttting the sizzling hot Rita Heyworth up on the screen in a variety of poses, as to create nothing more than a beautiful screen siren There's Gilda in evening wear Gilda in negligees, legs, lips, deariere and all.<br /><br />The story....Why bore you? It's a convoluted concoction involving international intrigue, illegal corporate enterprise, adultry and lust. Lots and lots of lust, but a weird love-hate brand of lust. Heyworth and costar Glen Ford do a marvelous job looking extremely hot and bothered up on the screen. Their acting is more than adaquate. It's simply a case of trite characters reciting blase dialogue in an attempt to tell an implausable story. To sum it up, I'm afarid to say \\"It's All About The Dance\\". Put the blame on the screen writers!!!
B000F8O35U|4.0|<br />I watched Disney's animated THE LITTLE MERMAID (1989) in one nasty, angry mood.  Within twenty minutes, I was feeling happy, caught in the spell of a strong story, gorgeous animation, and lively Oscar-winning songs.  The magic of Disney for kids of all ages permeates this story of Ariel, the likeable mermaid who falls in love with a human.  If she can go without her lovely voice for three days and still get the handsome prince to kiss her, she is a human for life.  The catch is that she can never again see her aquatic friends, like her king father and Sebastian the hilarious crab comic relief who almost gets eaten!  The central villainess is one of my all-time favorites, Ursula the sea witch, evil enough for adults and not too scary for kids.  She has stolen Ariel's lilting voice.  The story is taken from Hans Christian Andersen, but with a downbeat ending radically rethought in Disney fashion.  But I have a hunch the Andersen literary circle would approve of  the changes in making this a wonderful family film.  The voice work is perfection, including Jodi Benson as Ariel and Pat Carroll as Ursula.  Alan Menken and Howard Ashman collaborated on the songs; \\"Under the Sea\\" won a deserved Oscar, but I like \\"Part of Your World\\" and the hilarious \\"Kiss the Girl\\" also. <br /> <br /> The new double-disk DVD of THE LITTLE MERMAID is an absolute must-own, and not just for families with children.  If you are a child at heart, like me, you will treasure it.  And Disney Studios has restored the heck out of it--the colors are gorgeous, the image clarity is flawless, and the remastered soundtrack does justice to the music.  The 83 minute movie is on disk one, at its correct 1.78 moderate wide-screen aspect ratio, along with an audio commentary, should you decide (I did not) to listen to the co-writers and co-directors talk about the movie.  (They do enough of that on disk two.)  Also on disk one are a trailer for LITTLE MERMAID III (straight to video, probably a wise business decision) and a \\"Kiss the Girl\\" music video.  There is also a feature that lets you go to a particular song, a popular feature on a movie with these songs and an Oscar-winning music score. <br /> <br /> Disk two is mammoth, a good three hours.  I went to bed at midnight with the whole games section untouched.  There are 45 minutes of deleted scenes with commentary on what we are watching and why they were cut out.  There is another 45 minutes that goes behind the scenes at Disney Studios in 1989 at a time of great business upheaval to create the mood that this happy and romantic film was made under.  We also get a nine minute segment on animated special effects, like sea storms.  Disney was apparently thinking of doing THE LITTLE MERMAID back in 1941, but changed his mind and thankfully made DUMBO instead.  Or was it PINOCCHIO?  THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL is a lovely and sad animated short adaptation of another Andersen story, an exquisite bonus.  There are also LITTLE MERMAID art galleries and the original theatrical trailer. <br /> <br /> I still have Games and Activities to do, so I am not sure what to expect.  I gather that Disney was going to do a LITTLE MERMAID ride at Disneyland or Disney World, but changed their minds.  There is something called \\"UNDER THE SEA: A Virtual Ride\\" and a live-action segment on life under the sea.  It's an incredible two-disk DVD, and I have a hunch it belongs in every household.  Maybe even two copies--Disney is threatening to put this title back in the vaults for seven more years, and your kids may wear out one copy before seven years is up.  THE LITTLE MERMAID is not quite a Walt Disney immortal animated classic for me, but give it another decade and it might be.  For the time being, it is a fabulous way to spend a long evening with your kids.  Or even alone in a night bedroom. <br /> <br />
B000FVR5WK|5.0|The lilting poetry of Suzanne lures the listener into Leonard Cohen's world of romantic despair while introducing the essence of his sound: a deep monotone voice framed by sublime female backing vocals over simple but engaging melodies.<br /><br />Master Song, Winter Lady and Stranger Song reinforce the desolate landscape although the melodies are less immediate. Cohen's genius shines brightly on the immortal Sisters Of Mercy, a strange mixture of the spiritual and the sensual that must be one of the most beautiful song-poems in the English language.<br /><br />This delicate gem is followed by the poignant and evocative So Long Marianne and the understated Hey That's No Way To Say Goodbye, both masterpieces of words, melody and arrangement - the female vocals on Goodbye is especially impressive. The music sounds as if it is divinely inspired.<br /><br />I also recommend Democracy: Judy Collins Sings Leonard Cohen, to enjoy her beautiful covers of Suzanne, Sisters Of Mercy and Hey That's No Way To Say Goodbye. She was the first to cover his songs. Famous Blue Raincoat by Jennifer Warnes is another sublime tribute album.
044024157X|2.0|I like John Grisham, but I think his more recent novels have been lacking in the storyline department.  THE LAST JUROR is a typical example.<br /><br />This book is a fairly decent coming-of-age novel about a young journalist growing up in a deep southern town in Mississippi.  Unfortunately, there is not much of a plot that holds the events of THE LAST JUROR together.  Instead, we get a rather rambling, slow-moving narrative that takes place over a ten-year period, with a generous dollop of Grisham's political views on Vietnam, Wal-Mart, religion, and a couple of other hot-button issues.<br /><br />THE LAST JUROR is not a suspense novel or a thriller (despite being marketed as one).  The plot described on the dust jacket of this novel doesn't really get started until maybe the last 80 pages or so.  The whole revenge plot feels tacked on and phony.  The ending is anti-climactic, to say the least.<br /><br />I think Grisham is an entertaining writer, and his description of life in a small Southern town in the 1970s is actually very interesting in spots.  There are some scenes in this novel that are quite charming and enjoyable.  But, in the end, it doesn't add up to a good suspense novel, and that's what I thought I paid money for.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good thiller, my advice is to try Grisham's earlier work, or the books of Greg Isles instead.
B0002L30C2|5.0|This 1988 work which followed 1984's [[ASIN:B000002AZX Various Positions]], is very much a pop album in tune and sound. Lyrically it has moments of profundity as in all of Cohen's work but there is a lighter touch. Although keyboards are prominent, John Bilezikjian & Raffi Hakopian whose inputs made [[ASIN:B0012GMX3S Recent Songs]] so special, respectively embellish Everybody Knows and Take This Waltz.<br /><br />Jazz Police & Everybody Knows were co-written by others while Take This Waltz is based on the Lorca poem Little Viennese Waltz. On every track Leonard's voice is supported by either [[ASIN:B00005K8SO Anjani Thomas]] or Jennifer Warnes, and by both on Ain't No Cure For Love. It is worth noting that First We Take Manhattan lacks the dramatic German newscast intro of the Jennifer Warnes interpretation on [[ASIN:B000OPO6WY Famous Blue Raincoat]].<br /><br />The sing-along melody of Ain't No Cure For Love contrasts strikingly with Cohen's biblical imagery and references like: \\"It's written in the scriptures, it's written there in blood ...\\" And his version of Everybody Knows is still the best compared to all the covers, mainly due to the `oud' (oriental lute) of John Bilezikjian which adds a special dimension to the sound. The song was co-written by Sharon Robinson who later collaborated with Cohen on [[ASIN:B00005Q45W Ten New Songs]].<br /><br />Based on [[ASIN:0374526915 Federico Garcia Lorca's]] Peque&ntilde;o Vals Vien&eacute;s, the elegant Take This Waltz has an undulating mid-tempo arrangement that brings 1920s Vienna to life in striking imagery. It's an extraordinary tapestry of nature symbols tied to oblique expressions of yearning, ecstasy and sadness, e.g. \\"a garland of freshly cut tears.\\" The tone is enhanced by Raffi Hakopian's violin and the voice of Jennifer Warnes.<br /><br />Tower of Song has been interpreted by artists as diverse as [[ASIN:B00004SBMI Marianne Faithfull]] and Nick Cave and lent its title to a disappointing 1995 [[ASIN:B000001EZK tribute album]]. The experimental track Jazz Police with its jerky arrangement, semi-spoken vocal and absurd lyrics is not one of LC's lyrical or musical masterpieces but it does display some impressive instrumental flourishes.<br /><br />Judging by the many cover versions, these songs are popular under musicians; two are covered on Famous Blue Raincoat, five on [[ASIN:B000002ISX I'm Your Fan]], three on Tower of Song and five on the soundtrack album [[ASIN:B000G73UEU Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man]]. Although this one is not amongst my top personal favorite works by the Canadian poet & singer, it definitely deserves five stars for the quality of the compositions.azz Police with its jerky arrangement, semi-spoken vocal and absurd lyrics is not one of LC's lyrical or musical masterpieces but it does display some impressive instrumental flourishes.

0689865384|4.0|Uglies by Scott Westerfeld<br /><br />I have always been fascinated by dystopic tales, be they novels, films, or episodes television. I have loved The Twilight Zone - the original version - since I was a little girl. That being said, it is no wonder that the synopsis of Uglies intrigued me.<br /><br />Tally is a typical teen: that is, typical for the time when and the place where she lives. She's waiting for the operation everyone gets at age sixteen - the operation that makes a person pretty. Oddly enough, this tradition of cosmetic surgery seems to have made society a better place. People are more accepting of others and more cheerful as a general rule.<br /><br />Not only that, but the world seems to be pretty peachy for most people. There are fewer arguments and more agreements, less poverty and more technological improvements than in past generations. War is but a distant memory, and things are relatively peaceful.<br /><br />Then Tally's friend Shay knows vows to evade the surgery - and asks Tally to come with her to the Smoke,  a special place that accepts people who don't want to have the surgery. Tally thinks this sounds blasphemous. After Shay escapes, Tally is approached by the authorities, who know of Shay's plans - and tell Tally she must follow her friend and reveal the secret location of the Smoke.  Tally wants to refuse, but when told that she'll remain an Ugly forever if she doesn't comply with their wishes, she is forced to go on a journey she never could have imagined.<br /><br />As with some of his previous novels, Scott Westerfeld combines science with fantasy, creating a futuristic world whose architectures and inventions seem plausible. This could very well be our world, evolved - for better or worse - with the passing of time. This fast-paced story held my interest from start to finish. I couldn't wait for the next book, Pretties, then for the final book, Specials.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I have been a fan RHCP since the early eighties (Freaky Styley). I stopped listening to them after Blood Sugar Sex Magik and the loss guitarist John Frusciante. While I can't say this is their best ever, it certainly is a must buy and it is definitely their best release since Frusciante returned. It is funky, rockin' and rapping. I was a little skeptical about there being 28 songs. That is always a formula for disaster. For example - see Smashing Pumpkins. But I can honestly say there are only a couple snoozers on the 2 CDs. Most of the songs are fantastic. In summary, this is RHCP's best release in over a decade. It is a must buy if you are an old fan or are new to the RCHP's sound. I am really shocked they still had it in them to release something that sounds so good! A++++
B000HCO8IQ|5.0|The Scissor Sisters return on their sophomore disc `Ta-Dah', still stuck in that seventies time warp. Like their eponymous debut, the disco and Elton John influences continue, the latter in opening cut and lead off #1 UK smash `I don't feel like dancing', a camp disco affair co-written with Sir Elton himself, and sounding like ABBA meets the BeeGees. Other Elton John influences can be felt in the piano ballad `Land of a thousand words' and the `Honky cat' channeling `Might tell you tonight'.<br /><br />Upping the tempo and urging you to put on your glittery disco duds are `She's my man', the beautiful `Lights' with the line `When you cut the lights out/think of me' apparently inspired by Jake Shears' dying aunt's last words, the Ana Matronic led 'Kiss you off' (with a very Pet Shop Boys intro), and `Ooh'.<br /><br />My favourite song is the utterly brilliant `The other side', a dying partner's promise to wait for the other on the other side. It's a soothing mellow dance track with a great guitar solo and darting horns.<br /><br />This disc has already topped the album charts in the UK and debuted in the top 20 in the US. Here's hoping it gets them bigger success stateside.
B00005JPAD|5.0|I love this movie. It is tense and gritty but looks real good on the screen (heads up, ladies). I could not wait to see Damon and DiCaprio in the same scene together.

B000EGCITG|5.0|`I'm not dead' sees Pink returning in her angry rock chick persona, first heard on her breakthrough sophomore disc `M!ssundaztood' on which she finally came into her own. If you loved the hits `Just like a pill', and `Don't let me get me', then you'll love this CD.<br /><br />Lead off single and opening cut is the ska inflected `Stupid girls' which pokes fun at the obsession with being skinny, with lyrics like `They travel in packs of two or three/with their itsy bitsy doggies & their teeny-weeny tees'; Paris Hilton anyone?<br /><br />`Who knew' is a mid tempo rocker about the shocking (to her) end of a relationship. It starts off gentle with acoustic guitar, which builds up to a catchy rocking chorus, a format much of the disc follows.<br /><br />Other standouts are `Long way to happy', `Runaway' (a melancholic tale of a runaway), the introspective `Conversations with my 13 year old self', the Joan Jett like `Cuz I can', and the awesome angry dance rocker `U & Ur hand'.<br /><br />For ballads, there's the lovely soulful `I got money now', and the acoustic almost folk protest song `Dear Mr. President' questioning Mr. President about poverty, homelessness, war, and gay rights. It has faint Alanis Morissette overtones. Closing is a hidden acoustic track; `I have seen the rain' which is a duet with her father who penned it while in Vietnam.<br /><br />There isn't a single dull/weak track on this disc. Yet another superb offering from Pink.

0743454537|5.0|This book is an engrossing page-turner.  I loved hearing the different perspectives of the characters, understanding each point of view, sympathizing with their individual circumstances. A very powerful book that made tears stream down my face each time I picked it up. It truly touches your heart, and was especially close to home for me since I have 2 daughters, ages 2 and 4. I borrowed this book from a friend, but I will buy one for my own library. This book sticks with you. I had never read anything by Picoult, but now she's my new favorite author; I will be picking up another novel by her. Wow, wonderful book. I highly recommend it.

0307237699|5.0|\\"Dreams from My Father,\\" was the first written glimpse we had into this dynamic revival-like speaker, Barack Obama.  \\"The Audacity of Hope,\\"  doesn't recycle the same phrases from the first book but rather expounds on some of the author's philosophies.  The ideals are a breath of fresh air out of the realm of political mush.  Obama certainly has his finger on the pulse of American disgust with politics-as-usual.  Even from the center of the political ring he has credibility.  His persona has the capacity to unite instead of polarize and inspire rather than infuriate.  The last time a political figure kept the big picture in mind he was respected by both parties, served as a governor of California and enjoyed two terms in the White House.  Barack Obama might just have the same capacity to effectively communicate and bridge some gaps rather than cause more chasms.

6305075492|5.0|I've seen this movie from time to time since about 1970, but, with Image Entertainment's DVD, I feel like I'm seeing it for the first time -- it's that good!  <br />The picture on my public domain DVD (which I just threw out) basically looked like a few light areas (faces, lamps, etc.) surrounded by large black areas with no details - actually, I should say large dark gray areas with no details. It was often hard to see where the characters were and what they were doing.  <br />The picture on Image's DVD has a much-closer-to-normal gray scale and shows much finer detail. You can see things in the shadows. The gray scale still isn't quite up to modern standards, but I'm sure that's not Image's fault. You're watching an 85-year-old movie. They used the best print they could find, and it's a vast improvement over anything else I've seen.  <br />There's a string quartet score which works very well with the movie. If you didn't know better, you'd think it was the original score.  <br />They recreated the expressionist style of the original intertitles, and even added some \\"digi-dirt\\" to make them better match the rest of the film. The translation doesn't use obscure words like \\"mountebank\\" and \\"fakir,\\" like my public domain copy did. (Yes, of course you can look them up, but who wants to run to the dictionary while they're watching a movie?) <br />Plus, it has been tinted to match the original. That helps this movie a lot, because with its odd sets, it's often hard to tell if a scene is set indoors or out, or if it's day or night. <br />As picky as I am, I didn't find the frame line to be too distracting! It's not in that many scenes. I'm glad they allowed us to see the whole picture, rather than cropping the shots. <br />I haven't seen Kino's version, so I can't compare the two, but I can recommend this version without reservations.
0618680004|5.0|If you are open minded as to whether or not there is reason to believe in God, but do not care for the Dawkins certainty (arrogance, as some reviewers put it), I strongly suggest you read one or both of Sam Harris' books - The End of Faith, and Letter to a Christian nation.  Harris focuses on the dangers in today's world of belief without solid evidence. Rather than trying to prove that belief in God is delusory, his main point is that rational people need to put an end to the idea that it is taboo to even question a person's or a group's claims, when they are expressed in the name of faith or religion.  He also argues, quite convincingly, that civilized societies and individuals do not need religious doctrine in order to live moral lives.  While this is not a \\"light\\" subject, Harris' books are closer to light reading than Dawkins', and therefore some may find the content more accessible.
B00005JPBP|4.0|It has been a while since my group of friends walked out of the theater talking wildly about the movie we had just seen.  This is an exceptionally well written plot with many twists and turns.  As another reviewer commented, you do not want to miss on second of the movie.
0790729407|5.0|Rarely does a movie have as much historic accuracy, political insight, character development, and dramatic action as does this film. <br /> <br />The film covers 6 highly chaotic and transitional years in Ireland, from the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin to the 1922 assassination of Michael Collins in Cork County. <br /> <br />Many Americans, even if they are of Irish ancestry, know little of Irish history, particularly the relationship between Ireland and England. Since the reigns of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I there has been domination of the Irish people by the English government. After almost 400 years of domination, the rise of the Irish Republic was an amazing accomplishment. Much of that accomplishment must be attributed to Michael Collins, the founder of the Irish Republic Army, and the master strategist in the first 6 years of the rebellion. The film takes us through the final hours of the Easter Rising where the English military suppresses one of the first uprisings and challenges to their authority. The film shows the firing squad executions, one by one, of the leaders of the uprising. The film takes us to the guerilla tactics of Michael Collins, with an emphasis on killing the English leadership in Ireland. As the English send more and more ruthless enforcers of England's power, the IRA carefully kills them and creates chaos in their administration. Michael becomes a national hero but his first diplomatic mission is in some ways a set up. This leads to the political intrigue within the film. <br /> <br />The character of Eamon De Valera, the man who was repeatedly elected President of Ireland, is indeed complex as the film demonstrates. De Valera sends Collins to negotiate with the British under the explanation that Collins has earned this priviledge andthat the English wish to know who is so they can negotiate face to face. Michael is not able to negotiate for the independence of all of Ireland, primarily because the English wished to hold Northern Irelandwhere the majority of English protestant settlers had lived for generations after generations. However, De Valera refuses to accept a partial victory, undermining Collins' leadership and popularity with many of the Irish people. Very crafty thinking and manipulating were involved in this sequence of events. Was De Valera actually that Machiavellian?  The film would indicate so. <br /> <br />The acting is superb, with Lian Neeson, Alan Rickman, Stephen Rea, Ian Hart, Aiden Quinn, and Jonathan Rhys Meyer offering first class performances. Julia Roberts takes an understated back seat which serves the film well. Neeson is indeed highly powerful as the robust manly decisive Collins, a man who goes from being a street fighting terrorist to a hero and statesman. Rickman is super as De Valera. He plays De Valera as calculating, never revealing his whole hand, and extremely strategic. Especially strategic was De Valera's trip to the USA to gain funds and support from Irish Americans. Ian Hart plays Collins' right hand assistant through thick and thin. Hart is superb here. Aiden Quinn plays Harry Boland, a friend of Collins' who competes with him for Julia Robert's affection and then turns on him during the Irish Civil War. A young brash handsome Jonathan Rhys Meyer plays the young assassing who kills Collins as he comes to Cork to negotiate with De Valera. There is so much history to relate that the director and writers wisely de-emphasized the romantic in favor of the historic. <br /> <br />The scenes of Ireland are superb, the cinematography of urban Ireland was exceptional. A very fine film. <br /> <br />
B00005JOFQ|4.0|After much debate, I decided to view this film with an open mind.  The performances are outstanding.  I really liked the music composition, as it flowed gently with the story.  In a way, I'm glad this film didnt't win \\"Best Picture\\".  For one reason.  The on-location scenery is absolutely breathtaking to watch.  Maybe its too perfect.  Later on, We find out it's not Wyoming, but it Alberta, Canada.  Take a star away!  Overall, this is a movie that will advance gay right in the United States.  For those who don't like it, \\"the train has left the station!\\"

B0000009RT|5.0|Let me tell you a story. People have many bench marks in their lives, things that remain forever vivid in their memories. A first kiss. A new bike. Your first glimpse of the magical green grass of a major league ball field. Well, I have one of those magical memories: the first time I encountered the album \\"Freak Out\\". <br /> <br />It was 1966. I was 16. Me and my friend Steve were cruising through the new releases in the record department at Macys. Back then record departments were not run by hip-looking clerks who imagine themselves as being rock stars. This one was run by a dignified white-haired lady who had to be at least 60.  <br /> <br />There it was. The cover of \\"Freak Out\\" shouted out its fresh, shrink-wrapped existence, demanding that it be played. NOW! The problem was--we didn't have the $4.98 to buy it!  Now, down the counter from the cash register was a stereo. One of those classic 60's compact numbers where the turntable pulled down from the top and with the speakers mounted on each side. Somehow we convinced the white-haired lady that we had to play the record.  <br /> <br />I don't think our lives were ever the same after that, both Steve and I and the white-haired lady. It didn't sound like anything we had heard before. Frank Zappa had officially declared war on 60's America and we  had no choice but to go along with the ride. I save up the money to buy it. Could only afford the mono version. I have it to this very day.  <br /> <br />I won't try and analyze the music for you here. Other reviewers have done so more eloquently than I could ever do. What I want to do is to try and impart on those of you younger than myself is how monumental an achievement \\"Freak Out\\" was, and how it helped opened up 60's music to an astonishing array of creativity.  <br /> <br />By the way, if you like \\"Freak Out\\", try \\"We're Only In It For The Money\\", my favorite Mother's record, and possibly one of the best rock albums of all time. <br /> <br />If you care anything about rock, you owe it to yourself to buy this album. It's an essential part of modern American music. <br /> <br />David Teves <br /> <br />

From here he becomes Generation Next's Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) with all the resident toughness of the private eye, willing to get beat up to get some answers and meet the teenage equivalent of a head mobster, \\"The Pin\\" (Lukas Haas), whose presence is quiet, yet formidable.  His dress is with a cloak and he has a walking stick, making him a dead ringer for Barnabas Collins in the old vampire serial 'Dark Shadows'.  The gap bridge is between himself and \\"Tug,\\" a Pin thug who pummels Brendan until he is impressed enough to let him into his lair.  The young actors are so convincing that you get the impression that the high school they populate is one big, organized crime syndicate.  One sharp scene is where Brendan roughly negotiates with the school Vice Principal (Richard Roundtree of the first 'Shaft' film fame).  In the midst of the murder there are love interests and notes that provide clues in Brendan's investigation.    'Brick' is the little film that could--or one that can and does.  It is gripping and has all the anticipation of a whodunit with some violent, but convincing fight scenes.  Hardly a video game, the violence makes us feel every punch, like it was our own.  It is an artful enterprise with editing and music that underscores the nerve-wracking atmosphere of the movie.  We can feel the room spinning as Brendan looks up to his bedroom ceiling fan.  There is some needed irreverence to boot.  When \\"The Pin\\"'s mom dotes over whether Brendan is sure about wanting apple juice for breakfast, we have to laugh.  'Brick' is an effective and often startling teenage murder mystery with a earnest cast and an intelligent script.  Rian Johnston deserves praises for his screenplay and directing skill.
0670824399|5.0|One of the few Roald Dahl books I read, it remains one of my favorites from childhood.  I saw the movie too, and the movie is very funny, and I felt it did the book justice. <br /> <br />Matilda is about a precocious little girl named Matilda who has a crazy family (who doesn't support her at all and certainly doesn't respect her intelligence).  At a very young age, she is able to read very advanced books and she wins the admiration of her new teacher Mrs. Honey.  The only problem is her dim parents and the evil Mrs. Trunchbull who rules the school with an iron fist.  And then there's Matilda's new found super powers. <br /> <br />It's very funny, the predicaments Matilda gets into and the things Mrs. Trunchbull says, even if she is cruel.  It might be a little scary to very young children, but it depends on the child.
B00005JLIU|5.0|I saw this film in a drama class and fell in love with it!  Julie Andrews has a superb singing voice, and the other members of the big-name cast do a fantastic job as well.  Although bits are a little hokey, in the main it is an amazingly funny film.  The music is a ton of fun, especially the ultra-catchy titular tune.  In short, if you want something that's fun without being too thought-provoking, choose this delightful classic musical.
0618680004|4.0|This is an excellent, although at times hard-line review of the origin and role of `religion' in human affairs. Dawkins present the case that `religious predisposition' has evolved in the human condition, and along with it, a great deal of unwanted and negative side-effects and baggage. Religious ideas, he contends, largely exploit natural child-like gullibility, which the ancients exploited to their advantage (and some of course who still do). (There is a good analogy given of moths being naturally attracted to light, but which can, of course, also kill them p172-3). But like any drug, `religion' or the `God concept', can carry negative side-effects (or even negative side effects of negative side effects). To combat these negatives, we need to better understand its ultimate evolutionary origins, and moreover and in particular, remove or at least review religion's inherited special social privileges which many feel is simply not justified.<br /><br />This book may also be entitled `the case for atheism' (there is no god). While I'm not really a fan of it, I fully concur with its social agenda (we need to sort out our own affairs based on science and the law, with open discussion and channels always open for change and review).  Theism (a personal god who keeps intervening all the time), deism (there is a god but it/he/she doesn't intervene in the universe at all, meaning we still have to sort out our lives ourselves), and pantheism (the sum total of all the natural laws of the physics and chemistry are equivalent to god) are reviewed. Dawkins argues, a little over-the-top for me, that atheism is really the only truly logical stance, and certainly the best way to run the world. I tend to feel that deism and pantheism are also logically valid and practical, but that theism is not. In any case, Dawkins case that religion's special judicial and other privileges etc are simply not justified, seems entirely warranted. To repeat, and Dawkins often does, religion should be subject to critical review and change, just like anything and anybody else.<br /><br />There is much to be gained in science removing the veil of 'religion from God', and reframing it as 'religion by humans'. As mentioned, a lot of Dawkins argument about the evolution of religion is that children have a general and naturally evolved gullibility (because it was necessary for evolution to make them so-in order to learn relatively quickly about the world around them), but this same gullibility/naivety also allows for ideological fairy tales, half-truths, distortions, misunderstandings, Chinese whispers, outright lies, and such like to be believed as well, which ultimately (along with messy politics etc) causes much interference with rational social policy. He does note that a lot more may also go on in explaining religion's origins and historical development, such as hyperactivity in the brain, the misfiring of romantic love for imaginary beings, and even the herd-like and absolutist/ideological mentality of an evolved `military' predisposition (a notion he only briefly alludes to but that I particularly favour). p176 \\"Soldiers are drilled to become as much like automata, or computers, as possible\\" (sound familiar?). Also, p175. \\"Nations whose infantrymen act on their own initiative rather than following orders will tend to lose wars\\".<br /><br />Arguments for God's existence are reviewed. Most of these are, of course, nonsense, (eg from beauty or brain experience), however Dawkins is on shaky ground when he dismisses the cosmological argument (ie there must exist an uncaused/eternal first cause to explain all subsequent causes) entirely on the basis that the 'first cause' should, like everything else, also require a previous cause. This is a universe (including any previous universes) of infinite regress. Either the universe (and any previous universes) has infinite regress (ie it has always been), or its was formed/made from something which has always been (ie an eternal something-`God'). (ie It can't just appear out of nothing). These 2 options, at least to me, are BOTH bizarre, but then I have always thought it is bizarre that there is anything at all. But to choose which one of these 2 apparently bizarre options is the more valid, Dawkins comes down hard on our universe having infinite regress. He concludes:<br /><br />p31: \\"any creative intelligence, of sufficient complexity to design anything, comes into existence only as the end product of an extended process of gradual evolution\\".<br /><br />To repeat, if one accepts this, then the universe has infinite regress, which seems to me at least as bizarre as a universe made/formed/supported by (an eternal) something which has no prior cause. And who knows if our brains are good at judging such matters anyway? (eg to take another example : the concept of infinity, for example, is unlike all other quantities, yet it is still considered a valid mathematical concept. ie It doesn't require the same mathematical properties as other numbers just to be valid).<br /><br />Another criticism may be that there is a general lack of positive review of anything approaching 'religion'. I don't think this is an entirely balanced perspective. I'm not being culturally relative, just recognizing that if something as complex as `religion' did indeed evolve, we should expect benefits, as well as hideous negatives.<br /><br />Apart from meddling philosophy, most of the book is a good old-fashioned critical review of `religion' and social policy, up-to-date (2006), and relevant to today's world. Bizarre court cases, intelligent design, abortion, general moral dilemmas, cloning, stem cells, IVF, Cargo cults, binkers, a good deal of biblical criticism and scriptural contradictions, outmoded holy dogmas, terrorism, etc as well as perspectives on Marxism (and Stalin), Nazism (and Hitler), Fascism, Islamic fundamentalism, the Taliban, and Christian fundamentalism are given. Other topics include the roots of morality, changing values in human history, (particularly with regard to racism), and hopes for a better world.<br /><br />This book will certainly stir and invigorate anyone with any intellectual sense, and the alternately depressing, inspiring, bizarre, tragic, and yet hopeful stories should be told.(ie It can't just appear out of nothing).

B000E8N690|5.0|In a time where Hollywood is basically enamored with making \\"remake\\" movies, it is good to see Hollywood do something original for a change.   This even applies if the movie is a based on an autobiography.   \\"Walk the Line\\" is a movie that has its screenplay based on Johnny Cash's autobiography (and is also named for one of his hit songs, \\"I Walk the Line\\").  I must admit, up until the point I saw \\"Walk the Line\\", I couldn't claim to be a Johnny Cash fan.  However, after watching the movie, \\"Walk the Line\\" not only did I watch what I considered to be one of the best movies I have seen in a while, but it did give me a new appreciation for Johnny Cash's career.   This is a movie that will hold your interest from start to finish and will entertain you throughout.  Much of the reason for why this movie \\"grabs you\\" is because of the incredibly strong performance of Joaquin Phoenix. <br /> <br />While \\"Walk the Line\\" is a movie that covers the autobiography of Johnny Cash, much of the film focuses around his relationship with June Carter - who would eventually become Cash's longtime wife.    The movie follows the first 35 years of Cash's life as well as Cash's battle with drug addiction.    The movie takes us back to Cash's boyhood days where we can get some background of his childhood.   We learn how a family tragedy that occurred as a boy would have an impact on Cash for the rest of his life.     After Cash joins the Air Force, he meets his first wife Vivian (played by Ginnifer Goodwin).   After they have their first child Roseanne, we see how Cash formed a band and got his first record audition.   Following the release of their first record, Cash finds success and soon begins to hit the road touring with some of Rock and Roll's early legends.   During this time touring, Cash meets Carter and soon begins a longtime friendship and attraction to her.    The touring soon begins to strain his marriage to Vivian and eventually will lead Cash to the beginnings of his drug addiction.   The drug addiction will soon impact all aspects of Cash's life - his marriage to Vivian,  his relationship with Carter, and even his career.   The film even documents Cash's famous drug bust at the El Paso-Mexico border.    Cash's marriage to Vivian eventually falls apart.   However, the drug addiction continues.   Eventually, it will be June who will play a role in cleaning up Cash - and eventually will eventually become his wife.   The film will also highlight how Cash ended up doing his legendary performance (and recording) at Folsom Prison. <br /> <br />The one thing I learned about this movie was the relationship that Cash had with the early pioneers of Rock and Roll.   In particular, we see Cash touring with Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Elvis Presley.  This is something I never knew about.  The performance of Jerry Lee Lewis by actor Waylon Payne was excellent.  Although Payne's part wasn't a major part of the movie, Payne still provided the brashness needed to play Lewis - making for some very entertaining scenes. <br /> <br />There aren't many negatives about the movie, but there are two things that I feel are worth mentioning.  While the movie does a great job at chronicling the relationship between Cash and Carter, it doesn't do as good a job showing how the relationship between Cash and his first wife Vivian disintegrated.  While it is clear the drug addiction and infatuation with Carter had something to do with it, we don't seen enough dialogue between Cash and his first wife Vivian as their marriage began to fall apart.   The other negative is that it doesn't focus on Cash's later years - we don't see his relapse into drug addiction (that occurred in the 1980s) and we don't see his later projects (such as when he joined the supergroup - \\"The Highwaymen\\"). <br /> <br />However, it is going to be the performance of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon as Johnny Cash and June Carter respectively that are really going to be thestory of this film.  It is well documented that Cash and Carter (who both would pass away before the film was released), gave their blessings for Phoenix and Witherspoon to take on these roles.  It is clear that they both were perfect fits for this role.   While Witherspoon would garner the most acclaim for her Academy Award Winning performance of Carter (and while I'm not an awards expert, I feel this was warranted), I really felt it was Phoenix's performance that was the stronger of the two.  It is clear that not only Phoenix studied the part of Johnny Cash in depth, but would also completely master the part.   This mastery would reflect on the screen.  In each and every scene that Phoenix is in (which is most of the movie), you see how Phoenix had command of the character.   With all due respect to a legendary performer like Johnny Cash, I actually believed that Phoenix was Cash.   Another point worth noting is that Phoenix and Witherspoon did their own singing throughout the movie.   Not only did Phoenix master the character of Johnny Cash, but he would also do an outstanding job at doing Cash's vocals.  Witherspoon deserves a lot of credit too - she did a great job with the vocals as well.   Most importantly though, Phoenix and Witherspoon clearly had on-screen chemistry - and this was very important because the dynamics between Carter and Cash are the core of this movie. <br /> <br />This movie was about 2 hours and 15 minutes.   Some may consider this a \\"long film\\", but there is not one part of this movie where I lost interest.    You don't have to be a country music or a Johnny Cash fan to enjoy this movie - because this is simply an outstanding story to follow.   This movie is highly recommended. <br />
6305212112|5.0|I have always loved this movie! It runs on two timelines: The present, and the late 30's/early 40's.<br />It is about 4 wonderful women- Mrs. Threadgoode, who resides in a nursing home, and Evelyn Couch, a middle aged housewife who visits at this nursing home, actually, her husband, Ed visits, and Evelyn (who Ed's Mother don't like) spends her time in the dayroom, where she strikes up a friendship with Mrs. Threadgoode.<br /><br />Evelyn is going through a midlife crisis, but Mrs. Threadgoode helps her escape her depression by taking her back through time, with all her old-timey stories of 2 OTHER women: Idgie and Ruth, and the life and times in Whistlstop Alabama, and a little restaurant they owned called the Whistlestop Cafe.<br /><br />As THIER story unfolds to Evelyn in the here and now; A strange thing starts to happen in Evelyn's life. She starts to take BACK her life, which has pretty much been wasted on catering to an ungrateful and uncaring husband. She begins to feel ALIVE again!<br /><br />The book, and the movie ends two different ways, and I much prefer the ending of the movie. If you have never seen it, watch it. It is a movie that totally entertains, and makes you want to celebrate being a WOMAN !!!!
B00005JPB4|4.0|This is a movie of ups and downs, good and not so good, heroics and abject failures. This is not to be construed as a film about Iwo Jima, but rather is somewhat of a documentary of the three surviving members of the six men in the famous flag raising picture of Iwo Jima. On February 23, 1945, American forces reached the top of Mt. Suribachi and five Marines and one Navy Corpsman were photographed raising an American flag. FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS is a loose adaptation of that event and its impact on the war.<br /><br />In actuality, the famous photo was not the original flag raising on Mt. Suribachi. The original flag was coveted by a Washington politician. The movie depicts this person as a cabinet member. Something deep in my memory banks tells me this person was actually a Congressman, but I could be mistaken. At any rate, a Marine Officer at the scene wasn't about to let the flag fall into the politicians hands, so he ordered the original flag replaced and it was this replacement flag that was actually raised by the six men and depicted in the famous picture. Three of the six men were later killed on Iwo Jima and the three surviving members, two marines and the corpsman, were recruited into a public relations campaign to sell war bonds.<br /><br />The film, in Hollywood fashion, takes a rather cynical look at heroism. It should be noted that none of the three survivors considered themselves heroes, and granted, the act of raising a flag in and of itself, is not a particularly heroic act, but nonetheless, the photograph elevated the men to hero status, which the movie deconstructs piece meal.<br /><br />The acting and casting are both very good, and the battle scenes are extraordinarily realistic and graphic. I don't consider myself knowledgeable enough of the event to dispute some of what I saw, but I see some discrepancies of what I believe to have been true. For instance, and perhaps I have inadvertently credited an old Johnny Cash ballad as fact when that may not have been the case, but I believed Ira Hayes drowned when he passed out drunk in an irrigation ditch. This is not how his death is portrayed in the film.<br /><br />As war movies go, the action and filming of the battle scenes was extraordinary, but for me, the film overall was a little too cynical and almost seemed to have a bit of anti-American slant to it. If you're looking for good war action footage, you'll like the movie.

B000GCFO0I|5.0|I got to say this is one of the best movie of 2006 and my personal favorite.  It has been a bland year for movies, except for what happen in Silent Hill.  I won't give away any plots/ spoilers in this review, that for the viewers to enjoy.  How to describe this movie without giving away too much favors or details?  How about the bizarre and creepy feeling when you first watched the \\"the Ring\\".  The survive horror of \\"28 days\\".  The \\"what is going on factor\\" of Mulhlland Dr.  An independence directing style of an Indies type movie with a touch of \\"12 Monkeys.\\"<br /><br />The mood of the movie starts slowly and keep you wondering throughout the film.  I though the acting was perfect, maybe the motorcycle policewoman character is questionable.  I glad there were no superstar actors/actresses that stood out.  Silent Hill would not work with overacting actors, which would take away from the mood of the storyline.  The background music and scenes were great; it felt like being in a dream or some parallel universe.  The actions really balance out with the mood of the story.  There are no cheesy or Hollywood's cool styles directing here.  I could see why some conservative movies goers and religious fanatics might give this a low ranking.<br /><br />For gamers-<br />This is the best game to movie adaptation so far.  A 6 out of 5 for this standard.  More like movie to game adaptation.  Jolie did great for Tomb Raider, but that was really simple minded more base on a lead character.  Resident Evil's movies should have been more like Silent Hill with more actions, but those were way too cheesy.  Mario, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, D&D, Doom were all really silly, but not Silent Hill.  They really did a great job of pulling scenes and enemies from all the Silent Hill games in the series and mixing them in so well.  Watching this movie was like playing the game over again.  The \\"what?\\" and \\"what next?\\" factors were prevalent throughout this flick.<br /><br />This is a very enjoyable movie and the best I have seen this year.  The next Silent Hill movie would have a tough act to follow, if there is any.I have seen this year.  The next Silent Hill movie would have a tough act to follow, if there is any.
0393061434|4.0|If you are looking at \\"iWoz\\" as an adult book then I would give it 3 stars but for a kid it deserves 4 stars. Before I bought the book I wondered if Woz really wrote the book since there is an second author on the cover. But, after reading the book I can assure you, Woz wrote the book. <br /> <br />Its written assuming you haven't read every other Apple book out there or studied computer engineering. Basically its prefect for a high school student trying to decide whether to get into engineering. This autobiography shows the attitude you need or at least should have. The wording sometimes overly explains some things, the time span that is covered is so broad that the material gets thin in some areas and some events were written so that the reader isn't sure that it actually happened. So, this will unfortunately never be the definitive Woz book.  <br /> <br />Never the less, this is good autobiography and should be the first book to read regarding Woz. Some reviews that give it 5 stars are little overblown but \\"iWoz\\" is an enjoyable read that corrects common misconceptions found in other books. <br />
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|This is, no doubt, the biggest concert event in the history. The biggest stars in the music business performed together in the same concert and donated all proceedings to help Africa that was suffering from terrible famine (\\"Feed the World\\" was the motto). This is not only the biggest concert event but also the celebration of the human spirit. Hundreds of thousands of spectators filled in concert stadiums and greatest musical artists performed without expecting anything in return, all for one common purpose of feeding hungry people in a continent far, far away. If Jesus were alive, he would be so proud.<br /><br />You will see the greatest musical artists and legends, and this is especially meaningful since the music sounded so much better in those days; it was simply extraordinary. I still hard time believing how such phenomenon could occur: Duran Duran, Sting, George Michael/Wham, Madonna, Elton John, David Bowie, Phil Collins, Boy George, Tina Turner, Bryan Adams, Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan, U2, Queen, Paul MCartney and many others singing all in the same concert and sharing the same stage! Not to mention princess Diana with Prince Charles showing up at Wembley stadium (This DVD is like historical documentary and a great one at that). Phil Collins was the only artist that peformed at both concerts; he flew from London to Philadelphia (another piece of history).<br /><br />If not for music, which is more than enough a reason, you should buy this DVD to continue to help Africa (certain percentage of this DVD's sale is donated to Africa). And one more thing, this DVD also contains video of the song \\"We are the world\\" written by Michael Jackson & Lionel Richie and performed by most of the aforementioned artists and many others.<br /><br />Having said all that, I have to admit that I am a little disappointed by the fact that not all the footage from that day is available on this DVD. The reasons for this are given in the booklet: Bob Geldof, for reasons of legal expediency, did not even want the concert to be recorded. BBC didn't heed this notion (Thank GOD) but the tapes were largely forgotten in BBC's vaults, some had been destroyed or missing. The producers of US concert had taken Bob at his word and deliberately disabled all their footage so that it could never be re-broadcast. And some performances were lost because of satellite and power failures.\\" I wanted to add this last part because I noticed other reviewers were pretty upset about the missing footage too.

B000G75AE8|3.0|Yep, i am talking about the last Slayer production, aka 'Christ Illusion'... Not revolutionnary (this is Slayer doing Slayer!) but interesting and exciting enough to be listened again and again... ha ha ha...<br /><br />Most of the song are of Kerry King... So these are dealing about anti-religious, anti-christian and other heinous concepts...<br /><br />Musically, it seems that the band wanted to play as fast as their earlier albums ('Reign in Blood', 'Divine Intervention' or 'Season of the Abyss') and it sounds as slayer has always used to sound... Rough... So don't expect some musical innovations or experiments the guys put on their two previous releases...<br /><br />It may not be their best but who cares? Personnaly i don't give a f*** and i simply prefer enjoying some of the tunes! This is their tenth album after all and they have nothin' to proove. They just deserve some consideration for still having the ability to kick some a***s.<br /><br />Moreover, \\"Christ Illusion\\" contains some very intense songs ('catatonic', 'jihad', 'eyes of the insane', 'supremist' are my favourites) you will fully appreciate...
B000H0MKOC|4.0|The casting was brilliant. The dialog was witty. It was not so much a diatribe against smoking as poking fun against lobbyists. There were a few misplays. The kidnapping was just strange and I am not sure how that explained anything.     There is another review talking about smoking in the movie. I disagree. After the first few minutes, I noticed there was no smoking. I started to play close attention. There was very little or no smoking in the movie. Ebert comments on the same observation in his review. Again, the movie is poking fun at lobbyists. Everyone knows smoking is bad for you. What's the point of spoofing the tobacco industry?     My favorite part in the movie was the debate about the MOD (ministers of death) squad about who caused more deaths: smoking, drinking or guns. Another good point is the father/son relationship. The son knows his father is hated by everybody, but his father is very good at what he does, which is talking. The father doesn't apologize for what he does, except, maybe at the very end. The son respects his father's decisions.     The movie is not perfect, but it made me laugh and made me think about lobbyists, senate committees and our inadequacies and strengths of our political system.

B00005JPBP|5.0|The few reviews I'd read of this film were mediocre. I also had just viewed The Departed, which received rave reviews, and in my opinion lived up to them. Surprisingly enough, I could find very little to criticize about The Prestige. In fact, every minute of it intrigued me. <br /> <br />The Prestige is put together like a puzzle. The narration is cut into pieces and not presented chronologically. It follows magicians Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) in turn of the century London. Once having worked together, throughout most of the film they are enemies, obsessed with humiliating each other and surpassing the other's magic tricks.  <br /> <br />Jackman is the initially charming performer who is eventually driven to obsession. Bale is the focused artist who is very difficult to decipher. Michael Caine plays Cutter, an assistant. Rebecca Hall is Sarah, Borden's wife. All actors are excellent, including Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie, and Andy Serkis. Andy Serkis deserves special recognition for his small role. Piper Parabo has little onscreen time, but she manages to look lovely. <br /> <br />The Prestige has been criticized for its unpleasant protagonists, complexity, and predictable or ludicrous conclusion. The two main characters become their fixations, making them indeed unlikable. Their actions are intended to shock the audience. That's where I found the surprises. I guessed some of the secrets behind the tricks, but I did not guess the twisted lengths Borden and Angier would go to perform them. Many questions are raised at the film's conclusion, but I didn't find it incredibly difficult to follow. The film forces you to be patient and let the connections unfold. <br /> <br />Cinematography, outfits, and the setting are beautiful and add to the eerie atmosphere. Others have compared The Prestige to Sleuth, and the disturbing competition brought Sleuth to my mind. Some have called this movie cold, but I find it subtle, making it allthe more creepy. Its running themes were threaded into the story well. One theme involved us all wanting to be tricked; we want neither a simple answer nor brutal answer. <br /> <br />The title of The Prestige has an interesting significance. I'd recommend this curious, meticulously intriguing, and troubling movie to those who enjoyed Memento and don't expect a hurried film or one with much comic relief.
6305161992|3.0|Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee star as a cop duo in this action flick that attempts humor with some decent martial arts.  In the end, Showdown is ok, an average movie with nothing too exciting that will make you want to watch it again anytime soon.<br /><br />The coolest thing about the movie are the two stars.  The late Brandon Lee (The Crow, Rapid Fire) displays a few scenes of some great martial arts skills, while Dolph Lundgren (Rocky IV, Universal Soldier) is his usual physically overwhelming self, kicking butt wherever he goes.  Unfortunately, these two guys have done better in some of their other films, but it is cool to see them together in one movie.  Their chemistry, though, is a bit lacking, as is the cheesy humor that fails to be humurous.  Maybe back in the good old day it might have been.  The villain is played by Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (Kickboxer 2, Mortal Kombat) who is just downright dirty in this film.  A sick villain, to say the least, as mentioned by another review here, that disturbing scene with the beheading of the blonde.  In the end, Lundgren gets a swordfight against the Hiroyuki character, but unfortunately the scene is about over before it begins, and then the credits soon roll.<br /><br />Showdown has very little story or plot.  Most of the movie consists of pure action scenes and then some.  The 2 cops chase the bad guys, and they chase them.  Back and forth it goes.  Acting, of course, is below par, as is with most action movies.  I emphasive the R rating on this film as well, for there is scene after scene of naked women, cursing, and some gruesome events.  Some of it just becomes annoying.<br /><br />If you like Brandon Lee, Dolph Lundgren, and ok martial arts action, Showdown should be worth renting.  Buying may not be necessary, its not as good as I had hoped.
B000000WJ2|5.0|I bought this album long time ago when it came out. At first, I did not think much of it, and that Wicked as it seems has a real nice riff. However, this album really grew on me, as it is very subtle yet fundamental. Great guitar, great lyrics. I find it a great album to listen to, in the same way as exile on main street, when one goes through the struggles of life.

B000B8QEZG|1.0|Painful to hear and painful to watch.  A yester-year pop singer who doesn't have the courage to quit.  There is nothing left to do so she keeps throwing out pointless album after pointless album to stay in the spotlight; if that isn't the highest form of egoism I don't know what is.  She's got fame she's got fortune she had her hits why not just go now please?  What she use to do for shock value in the early days now seems so trite and pathetic.  The woman is nothing more then a spectacle with very little substance.  She uses anything from sex to religion to self promote.  Yes I was a fan in the days of Like a prayer and Vogue but I have moved on, why Madonna doesn't come to the same conclusion I will never understand.  This CD is good for the flavor of the month but its shelf life is way past due.  I challenge Madonna to put on a concert without all the antics and overt sexual malarkey that dominates her shows; she would be booed right off the stage if that were to happen.  And please enough with the crucifixion stunts all ready.

1596912367|4.0|What if you discovered your mother was an heroic half-Russian spy in World War II and not just the ordinary - if somewhat eccentric and independent - Englishwoman you thought she was? An adolescent's fantasy, certainly. But an adult woman with a young child of her own, like 28-year-old Oxford language tutor Ruth Gilmartin, might be justified in feeling disoriented, even betrayed.<br /><br />Ruth takes it in stride, however, once she gets used to the idea. Her mother, Sally Gilmartin, widowed and living in a remote village, seems paranoid, dotty perhaps, insisting on a telephone code, imagining someone is watching her from the woods.<br /><br />Then she gives Ruth the opening chapters of \\"The Story of Eva Delectorskaya.\\"<br /><br />\\"' Eva Delectorskaya,' I said, mystified. `Who's that?'<br /><br />`Me,' she said. `I am Eva Delectorskaya' \\"<br /><br />Eva's story, which alternates with Ruth's, opens in 1939 Paris where the globetrotting, ex-patriate Russian Delectorskaya family is mourning the death of Eva's beloved brother, Kolia, who was murdered. A stranger, Lucas Romer, approaches Eva, says Kolia worked for the British as an anti-Nazi spy and was killed in the line of duty. Now he wants to recruit Eva.<br /><br />Shaken, Ruth reflects on \\"how little we actually, really, know of our parents' biographies, how vague and undefined they are, like saints' lives almost - all legend and anecdote...\\" \\"I felt a kind of sickness in my throat about the unknown revelations that I was sure would have to come - as if what I knew now were not destabilizing and disturbing enough. Something about my mother's tone informed me that she was going to tell me everything, every little personal detail, every hidden intimacy.\\"<br /><br />Ruth's narration, contrasted with her mother's story, seems bland, but with hints of sinister possibility. It's 1976.  Some of Oxford's Iranians are holding demonstrations against the Shah and Ruth sees one of her own Iranian students taking pictures of them. They are friends of his, he tells her, and joins them. But why, she wonders, would they want pictures?<br /><br />Her son's German uncle, Ludger, shows up unexpectedly. Dissolute and bohemian, he has possible connections to the Baader-Meinhof gang and may be wanted by the police. It's all very vague.<br /><br />Eva, meanwhile, has learned her new craft from a master - Romer - whose cardinal teaching is \\"trust nobody.\\" She is part of a small unit disseminating false information through the media, at first in Belgium, then after the German invasion, in the U.S. Occasionally Romer sends her on \\"missions.\\"<br /><br />Her narrative builds, growing more and more suspenseful and mysterious. Agents are betrayed, people die. Quick thinking and good training keep Eva alive in a story that accelerates with twists, turns, double-crosses and betrayals.<br /><br />The meat of the spy story is in the US.  Romer's unit plants subtle and not so subtle stories in the press designed to lure or spur America into the war. Eva is particularly good. A plausible bit about German subs off South America might be picked up by a small news service. This catches the eye of a Spanish outlet, perhaps, and the item slowly finds its way back to major American media, picking up heft and plausibility simply from its repeated appearance in respectable media.<br /><br />Ruth's rather aimless existence gains a bit of spice too when her mother enlists her on one final mission - find Lucas Romer.<br /><br />Multi-award-winning Boyd, who has been casting a wry eye on colonial and post-colonial British presence around the world (particularly in Africa - he was born in Ghana) for the last quarter century is a consummate storyteller. Intrigue - private and public - always plays a part in his books and though his dry humor is missing this time, the intrigue is fascinating.<br /><br />Ruth's narration, in contrast, seems to have little intrigue, to be full of loose ends and fizzling subplots - more like real life. Perhaps the contrast is meant to show us how little most of us know about what goes on under the surface. Certainly the British propaganda unit strikes an uneasy chord with the present day.<br /><br />A most entertaining novel from an elegant and imaginative writer.<br /><br />--Portsmouth Heraldbplots - more like real life. Perhaps the contrast is meant to show us how little most of us know about what goes on under the surface.

B00005N9CV|5.0|This is certainly one of Diana Krall's better endeavours.<br /><br />The opening tune S'Wonderful has to be one of the best interpretations in a long while. It would be difficult to turn this terrific song into something less than it is, but Diana adds her own signature, a personal quality, that mesmerizing voice only adding to the song's appeal.<br /><br />There have been so many renditions of Cry me a River that it would be almost impossible to count them all. Ella Fitzgerald's rendition would have to be the best, but Ms. Krall, again, contributes to the tune in such a way that really makes it her song, somehow making us feel we are listening to the song for the first time.<br /><br />My favourite tune on the entire record would have to be the album's title. The Look of Love is one of my all time great listening songs; however, Diana's voice brings a new quality to the music, an alluring sensibility that is unmistakable.<br /><br />If there was ever a class-act, this is the one.<br /><br />The CD also shows Diana's piano skills, and she is not too bad.<br /><br />This is a CD recommended without question.<br /><br />The Look of Love is one of those records you can slip in the CD player, relaxing with a lover, and if you're lucky, will be spirited away.<br /><br />Diana seems to just get better and better.

B000059XUP|1.0|I was fortunate not to spend any money specifically on this movie.  I couldn't get past the first 15 minutes... incoherent beginning, and overly stylized particularly where Ashe becomes \\"the avenger\\" (for lack of a better name).  Nothing like the original at all, which I love by comparison.
0375831002|5.0|I posted this over a year ago...and for some reason, it came up a one star review! I tried to edit it, but one star was locked in. Thanks to a suggestion to delete the original review and repost another, I can give this book the rating it deserves.     One of our reading group members brought this book to a meeting as a possible selection for the month. It looked interesting...and since none of us had heard of it or knew the author, we thought what the heck, we'll give it a try. Every one of us loved it. It was the book I was waiting for.    We all questioned why it was classified a young adult book. Other than being a story about a young girl, and being a relatively \\"easy read\\", there was nothing childish about it. The content was so rich and the story line was often so intense we all felt young adults would not have enough of life's experiences to appreciate it the way we all did. I wonder how many adults will overlook this novel as a result, and miss out on the joy of reading such a wonderful book.    With the character Death narrating the story, it put a new perspective on a story we have all heard many times...Death's commentaries throughout the book were not only informative, but added nice rest breaks from the intensity of the story line.    I love reading a book whose characters are so well developed that I escape to a different time, a different place. Reading Zusak's novel, I truly felt a part of this intimate community. It was a marvelous book. One of my top ten life time reads...one of the few that I will read again one day.    Addendum: I have recommended this book to probably 25-30 people, and all but one have thanked me for it! Having read it well over a year ago, I truly realize what an unforgettable read it was.
0307341542|4.0|Well, people, it's October, and during this month I look for creepy stories with a melancholy twist.  BAG OF BONES by Stephen King served me well in the past, as did his SALEM'S LOT.  This book, SHARP OBJECTS, is nothing like either of those books, and yet, it did the trick for me.   <br /> <br />The main character, Camille Preaker, is a reporter for a Chicago newspaper.  She is also one messed-up, interesting, lovable young woman.   <br />Camille is asked by her editor to return to her hometown of Wind Gap to cover the disappearance of a young girl, the second disappearance of this type in less than a year.   <br /> <br />Camille accepts the assignment, but not happily, and when you meet her family, you can understand why. Wind Gap holds many bad memories for Camille; it is the place where her habit of self-mutilation began, a habit she was recently institutionalized for and continues to struggle with.  \\"Cutters\\" do what they do to deal with other types of pain, to distract themselves from it or dilute its power by inflicting another type of pain that overrides the other's power.   <br /> <br />As the story unfolds, you discover the events that sparked Camille's habits with sharp objects.  The longer she stays in Wind Gap, the more she struggles with this old impulse.   <br /> <br />By the time the body of the second young girl is found (in a scene I can't get out of my mind ), Camille is already struggling mightily against her past and the memories brought about due to contact with her mother, her step-father, and her half-sister.  Camille feels a connection to the two dead girls, these girls who didn't quite fit in, and she is soon consumed with the need to discover their killer.  <br /> <br />Pairing up with a young cop from Kansas City who was called in especially for this case, Camille sets out to get to the bottom of these girls' stories and to unveil their killer.  As she digs into the past of these two girls, she is also forced to go back into her own and face the unspoken truth of her own childhood and twisted family.     <br /> <br />I won't say more about the story - I don't want to give anything away.  It's a different type of book, not exactly a thriller, not exactly a mystery.  I think that is it's appeal, that it's not another \\"child killer on the loose\\" kind of book.  The true story is the revelations that the murders bring to light.   <br /> <br />I have a list of authors I go to for my \\"creepy October read.\\"  Gillian Flynn is now on that list.
B0000C23DO|5.0|My friend was looking through my music collection when he discovered one of my greatest shames - I had no Grateful Dead. My parents had not been fans of their music and somehow in the course of my collecting music, I never chose to get a single Grateful Dead album. Oh, I've tried to in the past, it was just that I looked at them and wonder to myself \\"Where do you start? Should I go in the studio direction, or should I go with one of their live albums?\\" That was just the first question. Even if I had answered that one, I would be given a great wealth of material, but I knew not where to approach it. <br /> <br />My friend saw this CD, and told me to pick it up. <br /> <br />This CD serves one purpose - it's for the neophytes. It's for the kid who was introduced to this band by way of FM classic radio. It is not for the hardcore fans, nor is it for someone looking for a distillation of all their great tracks. It is a place to show people who don't know better that this band is a lot bigger and better than the typical FM cuts. <br /> <br />The disc has two sorts of songs - they have the ones that everyone has heard - your \\"Trucking\\", \\"Casey Jones\\", \\"Uncle John's Band\\" (which my mother thought was Crosby, Stills and Nash just so you wonder how I got to be so ignorant about the band) and of course the 800 pound gorilla in the room - \\"Touch of Grey\\" (which even gets played on the store I work in). <br /> <br />The second type of song on the disc are the ones that rank amongst the band's best songs. I never heard \\"Box of Rain\\" before this album, but it clearly is one of the best songs ever. <br /> <br />Of course the disc is not perfect. Any one disc compilation of any band that has been around for more than 30 years is bound to miss a ton of great material, but the point isn't really to get all the great output of the band onto a single CD. The point is to provide the consumer who doesn't have a ton of money a chance to discover this band in a safe environment. <br /> <br/>Sure, they should have put on more live tracks (seeing how wonderfully awesome their live performances were), and perhaps a two disc set would have been better, but at the end of the day, it's a good listen and it doesn't spoil all of the surprises.
0743298020|2.0|I was sadly disappointed in this book.  I all but sat at the store awaiting its arrival and I'm a huge fan of classic literature and love a great story.  The first few pages held promise (reminding me a lot of Shadow of the Wind - which I absolutely loved).  The hype about this book was huge, but the reality lackluster.  The writing style and form is excellent, so no qualms there.  The author just needs a better story to display her talents.  The plot fizzles to the ridiculous with the ending being untenable, patchy and just, uh, downright silly.  I just didn't buy it at all (won't divulge the \\"spoiler\\").  I had a very hard time caring one iota for Vida Winter, she is just patently unlikeable (as are her parents).  While conflict in a character is great, you have to at least care somewhat about them.  I also found the main character rather ho hum.  Overall, disappointing.
B000GY729M|5.0|As many have pointed out, Brandon Flowers (lead singer), months before this cd's release, announced to the world that this would be 'the best cd of the last 20 years'. a bold statment from someone fronting a band that only had one cd under their belt. So, does it live up to that promise? Not quite. But it is a truly GREAT cd.<br /><br />The Killer's debut, \\"Hot Fuss\\" was a new-wave gem that came at a time when everyone seemed to be embracing the 80's and all it's glory. \\"Sam's Town\\" follows with something that is rare in the music industry these days. a sound that can't really be pigeon-holed. Part 70's storytelling rock, part 80's excess, the Killers have found themselves putting out a cd that will stand the test of time. The songs feel almost cinematic in their scope. And yes, you can definitely see influences by Flower's new hero, Springsteen circa \\"Born To Run\\".<br /><br />So, do i think this will be remembered as the best cd of the last couple of decades? no. but it definitely will be remembered as an amazing work by a band that are in this for the long haul.
0385510454|4.0|The Broker by John Grisham is a great story about one man's effort to escape from his old life and start a new one. Joel Backman was pardoned from prison and hidden in Italy by the government. They were all watching to see who killed him first. They didn't count on Backman taking control of his life, though. Backman does his best to cover his tracks while trying to escape Europe to get back to America. Although slow in the beginning, this novel is a must read legal thriller.
B000M4RG42|4.0|This film takes on a formidable challenge: try to provide viewers with a dramatic discussion of the Battle of Iwo Jima that's faithful to what scattered knowledge still remains. Our knowledge of massive historical events is generally pasted together from numerous fragmentary accounts collected from a bewildering variety of isolated viewpoints, making the assembly of a coherent narrative nearly impossible. For this reason, most cinematic recreations must resort to extensive embellishment and simplification to plug the gaps and keep events clear and dramatic, alterations that usually result in angry accusations of \\"Hollywood-ism\\".  <br /> <br />To confront this seemingly intractable problem, \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" chooses a truly innovative storytelling structure, a structure that is so astonishingly different that it has clearly confused its audience and reviewers. Essentially, this is a chronological retelling of three veterans going on a WAR BOND tour, but the narrative not only flashes back to the war, but also flashes FORWARD to present day discussions with survivors. It is very unusual for a film to show us the sources of its information, but by doing so the film wants to make us aware of its own gaps and conjecture so that we can decide for ourselves what may or may not be true. We can understand, for instance, why Doc Bradley's character seems so bland when we realize that his son is trying to tell a story about a man who avoided talking about the war, thus putting limits on what he knows and will respectfully reveal about his father.  <br /> <br />This focus on the war bond tour also means that, despite grand special effects and kinetic advertising, this film is not about battlefield action scenes, but rather about how three tortured veterans get dragged across the nation's hotel rooms as they respond to relentless publicity and romantic misconceptions.  Nevertheless, there is enough combat in the film to make direct comparison to \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" unavoidable, but Eastwood, whether because of his age or his background, does not edit his action with same type of frantic desperation that Spielberg specializes in. Instead, Eastwood's strength lies in his mastery of reflection, and this is a film that indeed gives us much to reflect on.  <br />
038551123X|4.0|I don't normally follow TV series because of 1) my busy schedule, and 2) disappointment due to cancellation or jumping the shark.  But I recently got hooked on the new Showtime series, \\"Dexter.\\"  It has become a Sunday evening staple due to the interesting premise, good writing, and great characters.  So when I found out that the show is based on this novel, I grabbed it.  I was looking for a good fiction book anyway, and I found one in \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter.\\"<br /><br />On the surface, Dexter blends into average Miami society pretty well.  He has a decent job as a blood spatter analyst with the police, a damaged girlfriend with two kids, and he even serves on the force with his foster sister, who is a prime example of frustrated ambition.  To the outside world, Dexter has all the trappings of a regular guy.  But as his internal monologue reveals, it's all a sham.  His life is a carefully crafted deception, a useful tool that provides the means to the single end that gives him meaning: murdering human beings in creative ways.  You see, Dexter is a serial killer.  However, he's no ordinary one, because his only victims are other serial killers.  Who or what prompted Dexter to focus solely on his doppelgangers?  Well, an understanding father can exert a lot of influence - especially if he's a good cop.<br /><br />Of course, Dexter has to walk a fine line to avoid capture.  He must maintain his charade of normalcy while indulging the ravenous beast within.  Even so, there are those who suspect something is deeply wrong with Dexter, like the intimidating Sergeant Doakes.  And he must remain on his toes around the vivacious Detective LaGuerta, a politically savvy but professionally inept officer who wants to, ahem, go deeper with our hero.  I liked these and other supporting characters, although one fades away during the proceedings and is all but forgotten.  Perhaps this was done to streamline the story, but it seemed a bit awkward.<br /><br />Anyway, to reveal much more would be criminal.  Indeed, if you are watching the series and want to maintain the element of surprise, you should put off reading this book.  There are some differences between the two, and they also augment each other.  But the book rats out the show's driving mystery (unless the series' writers do a 180 turn): the identity of another serial killer who knows Dexter's hobby and is playing a dangerous game with him.  So tread lightly if you value suspense.<br /><br />Jeff Lindsay has made who would normally be the vilest of men into a sympathetic character.  That's quite an achievement, especially since he did it so well.  I give \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\\" a bloody good recommendation.much more would be criminal.

B00005JPBP|4.0|It is interesting to me to watch this movie after seeing The Illusionist for a second time this past week. The two movies have many similarities and are both quite good. The main difference between the two is that they are marketed to different audiences, The Illusionist to the older crowd, and The Prestige for the younger. It is impossible for me to look at this without making some comparisons. <br /> <br />The Prestige tells a tale of dueling magicians, Angier(Hugh Jackman) and Borden(Christian Bale). The movie is about them trying to one up the other and steal each other's secrets. I could tell you more of the story but I think its best to go into the movie knowing little like I did. <br /> <br />Beware, this is far from a straightforward movie. There are about 10 to 12 twists that are designed to confuse and throw off the audience whats really going on, much like the design of the magic trick that Cutter(Michael Cain) speaks of in the beginning of the movie. I have no doubt that many will be confused by the ending of this movie, yet its not as complicated as you think. The truth is blatantly put in front of you early on, but the movie tries to distract you from it. <br /> <br />Regardless of any twist, the movie has other merits as well. The production values are top notch, with every scene of the movie being eye candy, with lavish sets and amazing locations. It is faster paced than The Illusionist, and I believe the accents are better handled here. (For some reason on my second viewing of the Illusionist Edward Norton's accent seemed to go in and out) I was really impressed with Bale and Jackman in this movie. <br /> <br />Some of the highlights include the electric field in Colorado, the many magic acts and the final twist. Overall this is a great movie that works on almost every level. It edges out of the Illusionist for its pacing. See this in the theater for the amazing visuals.
B00005JPB4|4.0|James Bradley's novel \\"Flags of our Fathers\\" was one of the greatest historical books ever written. By taking a human look at the battle of Iwo Jima and the lives of the men in Rosenthal's famous photograph, we got a very emotional look at ordinary men in one of the bloodiest battles of American history.<br />As I went in to the theater to see Clint Eastwood's film adaptation of Bradley's book, I was very optimistic. I felt that this could be the definitive World War II film set in the Pacific Theater. Sadly, I found the film to be a bit of a disappointment. It was a good film, but not the defining film it should have been.<br />Acting wise, the actors give fine performances. While Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford, Barry Pepper, Paul Walker and Neil McDonough all do a great job, the standout performance is by Adam Beach as Ira Hayes, the most tortured of the flagraisers. After seeing him in the underrated \\"Windtalkers,\\" I thought it would be hard to see him as anyone but Ben Yazee. But Beach's performance blew me away. He definitely penetrates the heart of the character, showing how tormented he truly was. Beach should finally get some long-overdue recognition as an actor.<br />The battle sequences are outstanding. The scenes definitely put you in the middle of the battle of Iwo Jima. And the scene of the flag-raising is truly memorable, as it shows what really happened with great reverence.<br />Where the film fails, however, is in the storytelling and editing. The movie jumps between the battle of Iwo Jima, and the story of the three flaig-raisers who survived, only to take part in the 7th War Bond's Tour as manufactured heroes. But the film jumps back and forth too much, and this becomes a distraction after a while. Also, two of the flag-raisers, Harlon Block and Frank Sousley, are hardly even dealt with in the film. To me, these characters deserved more than they got. Their deaths are also dealt with too quickly; after one dies, it's on to the next one to die, without any time to actually \\"feel\\" for these men. This is where the movie had its weak points.<br />Despite the flaws, it is a good tribute to the men who fought and died on Iwo Jima, and how one photograph made unwilling heroes out of six men who were just doing their job. If you're a fan of World War II films, or of Clint Eastwood's work, then you should find \\"Flags of our Fathers\\" to be a solid work.<br />Grade: Bactually \\"feel\\" for these men.

B00004Y6NW|5.0|DIRE STRAITS is a great debut album by the band of the same name. The sound is a blend of J.J.

The best songs here are \\"Down To The Waterline\\" and \\"Sultans Of Swing\\", the latter a tribute to a jazz band who know that they'll never hit the big time, but do it for the love of the music. This CD is a must-own for anyone who thinks that well-played, high-quality rock & roll died with the punk explosion.

It impressed me.  During our adolescence, we go through some unreasonable difficult emotions, which Sagan put in words nicely and freshly.  The love between father and daughter, the daughter's jealousy toward her step-mom-to-be, and teenage love... everything was beautifully written.  I also enjoyed the imaginable sceneries throughout the book.
B00004RF9B|4.0|Some of the greatest movies come not out of the art house world of independent producers but from the mass production movie studios. Don't believe me? Well \\"Casablanca\\" was just another pot boiler off the Warner Brothers lot but by some, probably accidental, cine-magic become one of the most loved classics of all.<br /><br />\\"Forbidden Planet\\" (1956) has some of those classic qualities. In fact it gets better with age. The remastered version on tape or DVD is a positive delight to watch.<br /><br />Generally speaking sci-fi movies date pretty quick. Today's gee whizz special effects become tomorrow's embarassment. Attempts at realism backfire as tomorrow becomes today. Even Star Wars is looking as old fashioned as the personal communicators on Star Trek. Yet with \\"Forbidden Planet\\" effects obsolescence somehow doesn't seem to have happened. The special effects of Forbidden Planet were good for their day and certainly don't compare to today's CGI effects. Yet as they have dated, instead of seeming just hokey, they seem to take on a more surreal and dream like. This has had the (probably accidental) effect of drawing modern viewers to focus their attention more to the story and character elements, rather than the sets.<br /><br />At the same time the electronic score for the movie reinforces this surreal and other worldly feel. The Bebes' score was actually the first all electronic music score for any movie. The fact that electronic music has tended to move on in other directions, and more or less become mainstream, has helped to reinforce the uniqueness of \\"Forbidden Planet\\". The music score was even credited as 'electronic tonalities' so as to avoid trouble with the Musicians' Union.<br /><br />The surreal landscape effects and unique score set the mood for Forbidden Planet ...without standing in front of the actors or obscuring the storyline. And the story is really something worthy of art house cinema. At least the ideas are. There is the loose relation between Forbidden Planet and Shakespeare's 'The Tempest' and, then a whole bunch of freudian inspired observations of \\"Life, The Universe, Everything.\\"<br /><br />You could call it \\"science freudianism\\" as much as \\"science fiction\\". Sci-Freud. The  most obvious are the \\"Monsters from the Id\\". If these creatures lurk in the minds of such an advanced and noble race as the Krell, what hope is there for mere mortals like us? It all raises the following question. If the Krell disappeared in one mad day, could it be that the mass destruction, wars and revolutions of our own times also be rooted in some kind of social psycho-pathology? Our monsters from the id.<br /><br />At times the valiant spaceship skipper refers to Dr Mobius's \\"enormous ego\\". And there is a comment about the need for law and religion to restraint the inner monsters. Mobius, of course, islolates himself from all of Earth's ego restraining institutions via his self imposed isolation on Altair IV, his private paradise planet. There is more than a whiff of deep seated human psychic concerns here too. First there's Mobius, a loving father's desire to protect his socially immature daughter from the attractions and attentions of a spaceship full of red blooded young men. There's rivalry between the leading crew members for Altaira's attention. And there is even the starship skipper's desire to keep his crew of young men (physical specimens he calls them) in line.<br /><br />All of these issues raise the larger concern of human progress. Even if we reach the stars, or as the skipper says, \\"in a million years\\" build a civilisation to rival the Krell  ....will we really change? \\"Forbidden Planet\\" manages to keep those human elements to the fore and in a sense presents a morality play with an ageless extraterrestial background.

0143036556|5.0|One of my favorite images from Collapse is the scene on Easter Island when the last tree is cut down and Diamond muses about the thoughts that might have occupied the mind of the last lumberjack. <br /> <br />Another section I found exciting describes a South Pacific island where the islanders made the right choices and developed a sustainable culture that has outlived many modern nation-states. At some point in their development, they saw how damaging their pigs were to the ecosystem they depended on and made a conscious decision to get rid of the pigs. <br /> <br />I found Collapse well researched, thought provoking, and challenging. I  enjoyed it very much and recommend it highly.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I love this album, and it is about the best thing I've heard all year. It merits a full five stars, despite a few quirks which I will get to later in the interest of a balanced and honest review.<br /><br />Highlights: The first four songs. Well worth the purchase price- the first track grabs you and gets your imagination going. Possibly also your sentimental side, since it is sort of a dream and flashback. \\"Wish I had an Angel\\" just rocks, and may get you headbanging a bit. It's also good-naturedly blasphemous, which for some of us is a draw. \\"Nemo\\" slows down a bit, but is really lovely. I think this shows off Tarja's vocals at their purest. It focuses on the search for self, and a voyage, which for many is a powerful subject. \\"Planet Hell\\" is the hardest track on the album, and very complex. I tend to hit repeat on this one, as will anybody with a soft spot for Wagner or certain parts of the Carmina Burana.<br /><br />The other best thing on the album is \\"Siren\\", which you may have to listen to a few times to fully appreciate. It's not immediately grabbing, but tends to sink into your mind and stay there. The operatic effects are never stronger than they are here.<br /><br />The biggest lowlight: Too bad they had to follow \\"Planet Hell\\" with \\"Creek Mary's Blood\\". I'm always mystified by the European treatment of Native American subject matter. This is tainted by hollywood- in the thank yous they even tell you what movie, and no prizes for guessing. The Finnish have their own indigenous people to sympathize with, so why not look at it from that perspective? I think this song is overly dramatic, and kind of homogeonizes Native American cultures- referencing various tribes and treating it all as one thing, and I am not sure they knew they did that. Musically, it drags. It should not be that long. It really sounds like it should be in the soundtrack of a weepy movie with a message. Fortunately, the album picks up right where it left off, afterwards.<br /><br />The musical draws for me are not just the vocals. The drums are outstanding. Good drummers are very hard to come by these days, and this band has one of the best.<br /><br />You should avoid this band altogether if you don't like opera, or have a narrow view of what \\"goth\\" is, or don't like an almost eighties retro thing going on in the male vocals. If you're openminded, want something that REALLY rocks, and have a soft spot for some older literature and musical styles; or are a drummer, grab this one right away./>The musical draws for me are not just the vocals.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|When I was in high school in the mid-ninties, Pearl Jam was the only band that mattered to me. I think I wore out my Ten and Vs. tapes on the school bus. For me, they could do no wrong in those days -- Eddie's vocals were unmatched, and Mike McCready may as well have been Jimi Hendrix. I knew all the words to all the songs, and had a Pearl Jam song at the ready for every possible situation. I collected promo cd singles, posters, vinyl, whatever I could find. Before the internet became the lightning-quick arbiter of news and media that it now is, I salivated at the thought of Five Horizons updating its Song of the Month MP3, which I had to play using a DOS utility. Old school. Anyway -- Pearl Jam was it. IT. <br /> <br />Then, they released Yield, which to me sounded like Pearl Jam lite, but wasn't enough to put me off. Binaural, however... eesh. Listening to \\"Light Years\\" I wondered what happened to my band. What happened to Eddie climbing the side of the stage in the Even Flow video? Where did Leash go? I let my Ten Club membership lapse. Riot Act was the first Pearl Jam album I did not purchase. I was far more interested in Radiohead and company than the prog-rock nonsense that Pearl Jam had become. <br /> <br />Then, out of nowhere, they returned. <br /> <br />I heard World Wide Suicide on the radio one day, and I was transported back to 1996. Pearl Jam -- MY Pearl Jam -- is back to kick the Nickelbacks and the Three Doors Downs of the world squarely in the behind. When the album came out, I bought it. In my car, when the first crunches of Life Wasted came on, I felt something that I had not felt in many years about rock music. Its not dead. It was just in hiding, waiting for the Backstreet Boys of the world to fade away. <br /> <br />Needless to say, I am crazy about this record. I listen to Ten now, and it sounds over-produced and juvenile to me. This isn't a bad thing -- just a sign of a brand new band with a record deal PEARL JAM is what the band who played Ten grew up to be, and it is something to behold. Actual musicians playing actual songs with actual emotions. <br /> <br />So friends, I say buy this record if you have not already. Crank it up and remember how American rock music is supposed to make you feel.
B000HIVQBC|4.0|If I were to name my 3 favorite Mode albums, they would be 1986's 'Black Celebration,' 2005's 'Playing the Angel,' and this one, released in 1993.  Reviewer \\"alan5973\\" mentions that the band had wanted to avoid making a \\"Violator 2,\\" and he is correct.  Rather than recreate the tightness and savvy of 1990's 'Violator' (a near-flawless record) the Mode went for a more \\"organic\\" sound, opting for less-precise production and incorporating live drums, heavier guitars, strings, uilleann (sounds like a bagpipe) and choir singers.  The result was a mix of 'tech pop', rock & roll, blues, and gospel, and ten tracks which shared a heavy religious theme... and it was absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br />The '93 release of this album did not, in my opinion, do it justice.  The cassette version sounded fuller and clearer than the CD version, which is a problem you'll find in many CDs released in the late 80s and early 90s.  Newer technology has made this remaster possible, and the result is mostly pleasing.  The CD in this special edition sounds awesome, but the 5.1 mix on the DVD is... lacking.  The mix, in half the songs, comes through the front and front/side channels, and in half the tracks (\\"Mercy in You\\" in particular) the mix is oddly flat.  My friend and I had just listened to \\"Violator\\" in 5.1 and we were astounded, but when we tried this one we were underwhelmed.  Granted, the mix on this record was \\"messier\\" than its predecessor, but we both felt that the capabilities of 5.1 were under-used on this release.  Because of that and that ONLY my rating is 4 stars instead of 5.   <br /> <br />As I said, the CD in this set sounds great.  On the DVD... well, at least there's an option to play it in PCM Stereo.  It sounds a bit better that way.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Elizabeth Gaskell's North and South is one of the most enthralling and illuminating period films I have watched yet.  Elizabeth Gaskell's story, set in the dirt and cotton dust of a northern industrial town in Victorian England, manages to marry the incisive socio-political commentary of Dickens, the romances occluded by pride and social propriety of Jane Austen, and the psychological depth of Edith Wharton.<br /><br />You will fall in love with Mr. Thornton (aka Hotty McHotty), rally against poverty and injustice with Marget Hale, gain understanding of the social consequences of the industrial boom, and wretch with pain and delight at Margaret and Thornton's tortuous love.  10/10
B000FTWB7G|4.0|I am not really a rock fan but when I first heard Amy's voice on 'Bring me Back to Life' I fell in love with her voice then the next two single made me buy the album. So I've been anxiously waiting for The Open Door to come out. So once it came out I bought it and initially I was a bit dissapointed because many of the songs are not as uptempo as 'Call me when your sober' but after a couple of days of listening to the album I'm Loving it. The album it very different from Fallen but it is very good. It has a lot of meaningful lyrics although some of the songs are a little wierd. My favorites are 'Call me when your sober', 'Weight of the world', 'All That I'm Living For', 'Lacrymosa' and 'Good Enough' <br />All the song are very different from each other and thats what makes the album very good althogh I think they over did the effects on Amy's voice. I prefer to hear her voice rather than a bunch of effects.  <br />The only reason I am not giving this album a 5 is because it take a couple of days to grow on you. <br />Just like with Fallen I cant stop listening to The Open Door. <br />Amy Rocks
0375831002|5.0|I am surprised by the young adult status. I hope that doesn't keep adults from finding this truely wonderful book. I read at least a novel a week and find very few books that I actually love. But the poetic beauty of this book puts it on my favorites list.
B000002MM8|5.0|Dead Can Dance \\"Into the Labyrinth.\\"  Beautiful, ethereal, trancendental, hypnotic, an absolutely classic!
B00005JPBP|5.0|\\"The Prestige\\" is excellent! This is one of the year's best! This isn't better than \\"The Illusionist\\" (2006), but, however, it establishes its own pace and is different than \\"The Illusionist\\". The directing by Christopher Nolan (who is directing the upcoming Batman movie \\"The Dark Knight\\" (2008) and also wrote the story, Nolan also co-wrote the screenplay to \\"The Prestige\\" with his brother Jonathan, which is based on the novel by Christopher Priest. Nolan has also done \\"Batman Begins\\" (2005), which he co-wrote the screenplay and directed, which in fact is the prequel to \\"The Dark Knight\\", he has also done the American remake of \\"Insomnia\\" (2002), and the impressive psychological thriller \\"Memento\\" (2000), which he, again, also co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan and both were nominated for an Oscar for their screenplay and he also wrote and directed his debut film \\"Following\\" (1998) is excellent! Nolan is one of the best directors of our generation! The performances by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, & Michael Caine (both Bale and Caine worked with Nolan on \\"Batman Begins\\" and are currently working with him again on \\"The Dark Knight) are excellent! The music by David Julyan (who also did the music to Nolan's \\"Following\\", \\"Memento\\", & \\"Insomnia\\", he also did the music to \\"The Descent\\" (2006) is excellent! The cinematography by Wally Pfister (who also nominated for an Oscar for his work on Nolan's \\"Batman Begins\\", he also done Nolan's \\"Memento\\", \\"Insomnia\\" & the upcoming \\"The Dark Knight\\") is excellent! The film editing by Lee Smith (who was nominated for an Oscar for his work on \\"Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World\\" (2003), he has done Nolan's \\"Batman Begins\\" & the upcoming \\"The Dark Knight\\") is excellent! The casting by John Papsidera (who also done the casting to Nolan's \\"Memento\\" & \\"Batman Begins\\", he has also done the casting to \\"Final Destination 3\\" (2006) is excellent! The production design by Nathan Crowley (who also done the productiondesign to Nolan's \\"Insomnia\\", \\"Batman Begins\\", & the upcoming \\"The Dark Knight\\", he has also done the production design to \\"The Lake House\\" (2006) is excellent! The art direction by Kevin Kavanaugh (who also did the art direction to \\"The Lake House\\") is excellent! The set decoration by Julie Ochipinti (who was also an assistant art director on Nolan's \\"Batman Begins\\") is excellent! The costume design by Joan Bergin is excellent! This is another one of Nolan's films that has put him in the place of master filmmakers. This is a visually, brilliant looking movie and it is also an impressive, smart, and excellent film that makes you think and keeps you guessing and makes you want more answers and questions. It is at times, confusing, but, it didn't affect me at all, because it is different than any movie out there right now, just like \\"The Illusionist\\" was before it or is, in some terms.
0316172324|1.0|This was a book club selection that I forced myself to finish.  I was very frustrated with this book as it said the same thing over and over again.  If I ever hear the term \\"thin-slicing\\" again, it will be too soon! <br /> <br />While some of the examples were good, there was just too much repetition.  Basically, it reads like a textbook.  I expected to learn how to use the information provided, rather than read the same examples over and over again.  This information would have been better shared in a magazine article with a handful of examples.  There is no way this book deserved the acclaim it has received.  Do not waste your money.
B00004YZT5|5.0|This is the best Poison album ever. I was worried when CC left the band, but after listening to this album, I was completely blown away. Richie is an awesome musician, and his contribution to this album is priceless. On this album, the Poison sound is taken to a new, more matured level, which I really liked.
B000068FXX|4.0|Supertramp had, by this time, built a substantial audience that embraced the band's unique combination of catchy, intelligent pop/rock flavored with progressive rock stylings.  \\"Even In The Quietest Moments\\" found the band making a further move towards the catchy pop, although still with progressive leanings.  The band found its first Top 20 hit with \\"Give A Little Bit\\", which also brought the album to the Top 20.  The rest of the album is flavoured with solid, intelligent songs like the title track and \\"From Now On\\".  The closing track, \\"Fool's Overture\\", is a bit longish, using sampled radio and TV tracks througout - it's really about a 4 minute song with about 7 minutes of technological inserts.  But it's also catchy, and set the stage for Supertramp's growing cynicism of modern society, a mindset that would grow on their next album, the hugely popular \\"Breakfast In America\\".
B000GYI32M|3.0|What's with Warner not including English Subtitles on their dvd releases any more?? I guess I'll be saving money from now on and not purchasing these sets. All/most Warner sets in the past have had them and now they stopped. Why??
B000AJJNPY|4.0|This album is a delight - something rare for a foreign-language album that I can't even understand what is said!  But the sound is so full of passion and emotion - while still ranging from rock to soft pop.  Sigur Ros is one of those rare bands that can communicate in almost any language because the sound is one that seems universal.  This album is unique and is an excellent choice for a night of relaxation - it's worth checking out for sure.
B000001DQG|5.0|Caribou is not considered one of Elton's classic albums, I don't know why.  The album has a few fillers that aren't bad, but the rest of the album has some gems that everyone knows like the rocker \\" The Bitch is Back \\" and the beautiful \\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me\\",. There are some other great songs that you will not hear on the radio or in concert. The songs Pinky,Grimsby,I've Seen the Saucers,Cold Highway, and Ticking are all fantastic.  Give this one a listen, It's a young Elton close to his very best.
B000068FWC|4.0|Supertramp had a solid fan base that grew exponentially after \\"The Logical Song\\" became the band's first Top 10 song, dominating both AM and rock radio.  As the band's popularity zoomed into the stratosphere, and the second single \\"Goodbye Stranger\\" was released (which was even more friendly to AM radio), fans circa \\"Crime of the Century\\" were screaming sellout.  To a small degree, this was true; but it's also true that Supertramp had evolved a keen sense of catchy pop sounds, probably the best of the late 1970's, and their songwriting had moved into a witty, and deliciously biting style that was disarming and yet bouyant.  For the cynical side, catch \\"Gone Hollywood\\", \\"Breakfast In America\\" or \\"The Logical Song\\"; on the catchy pop side, don't miss \\"Oh Darling\\", \\"Take The Long Way Home\\" or \\"Lord Is It Mine\\".  All in all, this album is a step in the natural progression of the band's style;but it still has to make Roger Hodgson and Rick Davies chuckle - that their biggest selling album was the one in which they took the biggest lyrical potshot at the society that bought their album in bucketloads.
1401201911|5.0|I hate Superman but I thought Red Son was a great read. This one should be up there with Moore's Watchmen and Miller's Dark Knight with regard to landmark events in the graphic novel. I won't give away any surprises, but this is a fun and intellectual exploration into the history of an American icon, propaganda, and post-war history. This places the Seigel and Shuster creation in an historical epoch, paying homage to the Man of Steel's early socialist roots while exploring alternate past and alternate future histories, with a neat sharp left turn at the end. Even an iconoclast such as myself enjoyed this trip through truth, justice and 1917. You have nothing to lose but your chains of ideology.
0618680004|1.0|\\"Eyes they have and cannot see, ears they have and cannot hear\\" This is the way the Psalmist describes those who deny the existence of God. Richard Dawkins is such a denier, and he is clearly a person who simply does not have , what might be called, religious experience. This religious experience in all its varieties cuts across a wide variety of human cultures. It does not necessarily lead to the personal God of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. But it does  most often lead to a sense of a Beyond which brings the human observer to awe and humility. Dawkins has no such awe and he certainly has no such humility. He cannot see and he cannot hear.<br /><br />He is however of course an extremely capable scientist and intellectual figure. And he can chronicle the abuses of organized religion in a fairly effective way. Once the noted teacher of Judaism Rabbi Berel Wein said, that it is a mistake to wholly identify Judaism with everything that Jewish people do. That is to say the behavior of Mankind often falls short of the ethical and moral norms inherent in their systems of belief. I think it is simply too simple to point out all the crimes and follies done in the name of religion, and by this try to 'erase' the place of God in the heart of and in much of the best creative and ethical action of Mankind.<br /><br />Dawkins is to my mind, gratuitously insulting. His remarks on the 'Old Testament God' the God who gave Mankind the 'Ten Comnmandments' and the fundaments of human morality show a very selective and poor feeling for the Biblical text.Again a lack of an emotional understanding of the beauty and greatness of the Biblical text.Consider,  \\"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want\\" The beauty of this text, its deep faith, its longing all point to the fact that Mankind is ennobled, enriched, uplifted through its connection with God.<br /><br />Dawkins has no conception of the idea of what it means to ' sanctify life' by connecting our actions with doing the will of , and loving God.<br /><br />He simply doesn't get anything except the uglier manifestations of religion.<br /><br />He too takes on the traditional arguments for the existence of God. It is doubtful of course, and Pascal knew this more than anyone else, that religious believers believe in God because of these arguments. But Dawkins takes them on in a quite unsophisticated way. Apparently between a top- notch scientist and being a competent philosopher are not the same thing.<br /><br />Most importantly I think that for a person like myself who needs God, who prays to God every day, who is time and again filled with gratitude to God for the goodness of my life, and so much goodness in the world Dawkins argument is an insult. It is an insult because it doesn't take really into account our world of human experience and feeling, the world of a very great share of Mankind, those for whom 'it is good to dwell in the House of the Lord\\".<br /><br />Here if I may I would simply suggest a model something similar to the one E.O. Wilson presented in his appeal to religious believers to show reverence in protection of the natural world. It in a sense parallels  the model suggested by the late Rabbi Joseph Dov Ber Solovetchik , who spoke about two aspects of human nature, the scientific - technical world- transforming side, and the religious G-d worshipping side. Mankind is richer and greater when both these aspects are properly respected and developed.<br /><br />Denying the reality of God does not as Dawkins would have it , improve Mankind, it rather diminishes us terribly.<br /><br />Before the beginning, and beyond the End there will be God .d.  <br />He simply doesn't get anything except the uglier manifestations of religion.  <br />He too takes on the traditional arguments for the existence of God.

B00005JPB4|5.0|This is a story of conflicts. It does not disappoint; neither does it entertain. It is a must-see; it is not enjoyable.  It raises more questions than it answers.<br /><br />Like most Boomers I was raised to revere the flag-raising on Mount Surabachi. Finding out the truth behind it was a punch in the stomach, and yet that truth did not diminish the sacrifice of the brave men who made that flag-raising possible. I believe the combat flashbacks were entirely realistic, though never having been in combat, I am only qualified as an intellectual, not experiential judge. The combat scenes had the effect of satisfying the quest for glory that lies buried beneath the surface of most American males. At that same time they aroused great feelings of disgust. When the one man was blown to bits from an artillery round and his helment landed on his buddy with the severed head inside, I was disgusted by the senseless gore but even more disgusted by my delight in that gore.<br /><br />Learning that the government manufactured the three heroes for the sake of a war bond drive was another punch in the stomach, a worse one. The government bureaucrat argued quite well that previous bond drives had failed to reach goal and that the war effort was in jeopardy as a result. If the three were not true heroes, they had an obligation to act the part, of only for the money. With its lofty ideals of freedom and democracy, why must the nation always be fooled into doing the right thing? But learning the ignominious fates of the three was the worst punch of all. What a manic-depressive lot we are to place such men on the loftiest of pedestals only to forget them when the parades are over and piles of ticker tape lie in the street.<br /><br />In summary, there is disappointment to be found in this movie, but not in the film itself as some of the other reviewers have complained. The disappointment lies in ourselves.<br /><br />An aside: US forces suffered 26,000 casualties with nearly 7,000 dead in taking Iwo Jima. A point made in the movie was that Iwo was a vital emergency landing sight for the many B-29 crews returning from Japan, underscored by the landing of the B-29 'Dinah Mite' while the island was still unsecured. Further research shows that for the remainder of the war 2,251 'genuine' emergency landings were made on Iwo. Assuming the average emergency landing saved the lives of a full B-29 crew of 13 members (this was later in the war), that's over 29,000 men saved not to mention the 2,251 aircraft. It's anybody's guess as to whether all of those emergencies would have suffered complete loss of crew out over the Pacific, but it appears that the operation showed a net profit. War is, after all, a business albeit a grim one.<br /><br />--Ejner Fulsang, author of \\"A Knavish Piece of Work,\\" Aarhus Publishing, 2006,000 dead in taking Iwo Jima.

War is, after all, a business albeit a grim one. <br /> <br />--Ejner Fulsang, author of \\"A Knavish Piece of Work,\\" Aarhus Publishing, 2006
B000E8SCG2|5.0|A delightful way to spend a couple of hours..A big family tries to do all it can to help Diane Lane find a new romance. Christopher Plummer is worth the price of the entire video. His scenes with his dauhgter (Lane) are funny and very touching. Treat yourself a wonderful romantic escape.
B000HT386M|2.0|This is a very disappointing movie.  If Adam Sandler opens a flix for you, then get it.  You'll possibly enjoy seeing him roll out his rag tag bag of pointless expressions in a B-level comedy trying desperately not to insult the concept of \\"It's a Wonderful Life.\\"  You really cannot mix charm and slapstick.  More importantly, you figure out this one from the start which makes a majority of the movie pointless.  (Spoilers Ahead).  The movie makes no attempt to hide its heavy handed hint this is all a dream, which makes it hard to be invested in the diabolical that will become this man's pathetic and empty life.  Ultimately, we end up not caring about our \\"hero\\" one way or the other.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|When I first heard it, I honestly wasn't too happy with the latest John Mayer CD. I've loved his music for a long long time, but Continuum isn't much like anything he's ever done. After listening to it for a few days, I fell in love with the CD. It's much more jazzy than his other songs. It's incredible . . . I definitely recommend the CD to everybody.
B000H305U0|5.0|First of all it took me a while to order this CD. I really liked a few songs on his first CD \\"Justified\\", and was hesitant to buy it. After hearing and seeing the video \\"My Love\\" featuring fine azz TI, I knew I had to have it!<br /><br />I got my CD yesturday and was pleasantly surprised when the first track played, \\"Futuresex Lovesounds\\", I automatically loved it, I also like \\"Until The End Of Time\\", let's just say the CD has been on repeat ever since. The whole CD is good, and Justin has came a long way since he was in Nsync, and I am glad he went a different route. Timbabland provides some phat beats,and Justin's voice is sounding real good. On a few of the tracks he has a very Prince kinda vibe and I am feeling it!!<br /><br />I am a true R&B kinda girl, and I must say Justin is doing the damn thing!<br /><br />Get this CD!!
0307341542|4.0|The first thing that strikes me as a reader of Sharp Objects is Flynn's mastery of her craft. On a micro level, she crafts sentences that sing, deftly describing characters with not one more word than necessary.<br /><br />On a larger scale, she creates an environment so stifling I felt claustrophobic just reading. The small, evil town of Wind Gap, where bored residents let off steam by petty meanness to one another. The heroine's banally evil family. The heroine's own mind, where she traps herself with limited possibilities.<br /><br />For a first novel (or even a second or third), the pacing is awesome. Despite my claustrophic feeling and increasing distaste for the characters, I didn't want to stop.<br /><br />But after awhile, the sheer tawdriness of the characters became wearying. The heroine herself is beyond flawed. She becomes less likeable as we learn of her past, gradually. Yet she doesn't transcend her past or even understand. She doesn't even take charge of her life.<br /><br />Sent by her editor to cover her home town, she meekly agrees to stay with her family to save on expenses. (Couldn't she pretend her mother didn't have a guest room?) And that begins her descent into a peculiar hell, with no relief in sight.<br /><br />The author deserves a lot of credit for introducing a heroine with this particularly distasteful psychological affliction. Perhaps she deserves credit for an ending that may be realistic but actually feels like a let-down. I don't understand the motive of the characters who help her at the very end. And I don't see much hope for the heroine. Her visible and invisible scars, combined with her family history, mean that some options will be forever closed.<br /><br />I wouldn't mind the negatives if we readers came away with a new understanding or a new way of looking at the world. But instead we get unsparing views of ugly, horrific scenes (I had to turn pages very fast durng a description of the pig farm) with no redeeming value, no sense of a system that could be changed or admiration for someone battling an abusive past.<br /><br />So ultimately I agree with reviewers who say, \\"It's a great novel but she could do even better.\\" Such a masterful author could give us something to savor for a long time to come.ration for someone battling an abusive past.    So ultimately I agree with reviewers who say, \\"It's a great novel but she could do even better.\\" Such a masterful author could give us something to savor for a long time to come.
1400034205|4.0|The Razor's Edge is another proof of Mougham's brilliant narration and psycho analysis through his characters . Isabelle remains in memory as a worldly lady who sacrificed her love for better social status and someone who never appeared made for Larry. I loved the way author described Larry's thought processes  and situations - just brilliant.
B000002B7O|5.0|When I got this cd, I didn't have enough money to get the new version, luckily!  I listened to the new re - recorded version, and this cd is so much better its not even funny.  GET THIS ONE!.<br /><br />This album was originally released in 1982, and is sadly the last album with Randy Rhoads in it.  This album has great guitar solo's, lyrics, drums, and bass work in it.<br /><br />ok so now lets look at the cd.<br /><br />Printing, good glossed over paper for protecting the cd, It has original album art, lyrics, and some pictures. And the song listing. 5/5.<br /><br />Technical - Just in this special case, it has not been tampered with so were going to go with 10/5<br /><br />Songwise now.<br /><br />Over the Mountain - One of Ozzy's greatest songs, and one of my favorites, maybe the best song on the cd, its a great opening for this cd.  It has a spookifying guitar riff, and an amazing solo. Drums and bass work good, and Ozzy's voice is great on this song. 5/5<br /><br />Flying High Again - Great Guitar work, Great solo, funny lyrics, and Good musicianship - 5/5<br /><br />You Can't Kill Rock and Roll - A balled like song, about Ozzy's true love - Rock and Roll, its a good song, with good lyrics and guitar work. 5/5<br /><br />Believer - An astonishing work of art by Ozzy, great lyrics, and Guitar work like usual. 5/5<br /><br />Little Dolls - Great Lyrics, Great Guitar work, and just a great song. 5/5<br /><br />Tonight - A rock balled like song, its very good, good lyrics, and guitar work, however like every cd has one, its the weakest song on the album, but its still a great great song. 4/5<br /><br />S.A.T.O. - A Dramatic song, with some of the greatest guitar work ever, and Ozzy's Voice shines on it. 5/5<br /><br />Diary Of A Madman - Some of the greatest guitar work, and spooky lyrics - Kudos to RANDY RHOADS ON THIS ALBUM!!!.<br /><br />Overall Rating 5/5. This and Blizzard of Ozz, are the greatest Ozzy cd's.  I love the others, but these just are.these just are.
0142000663|5.0|I cannot explain enough what I felt after reading this book. The socialistic subject matter Steinbeck handles in this book is so heavy but the same time a brilliant narration. The local dialect used made me feel like people speaking directly to me ...not just reading. I watched this movie last week hence I thought I read the reviews of this book- movie is quite different from the book - I like the book better. I am unable to review it myself. I am so happy that I read it during my college days otherwise I would not have found some time in this busy schedule.
B000GPIPD8|5.0|its between this and : the new live my moring jacket for best of the year...technically the singer is 100% perfect pitch and tone...unreal voice...soooooo much style....just a great band...wonderful.
B000HA4W4S|4.0|I really can't come up with anything that hasn't already been posted here in terms of rave reviews. The new CD is great. That said, I'd advise the Sisters to maybe watch what they say the next time they tour the UK, as it WILL eventually reach the other side of the Atlantic. Quoted in NME, Ana Matronic said at a London show that London was the group's new hometown, and that \\"British people are smarter than Americans.\\" Which begs the question of why American fans should even bother parting with their hard-earned cash. But I'll be fair, their sound is as good as ever, and the first single is addictive. But it's hard to feel like dancin' after you've been insulted.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Michael Jackson does a great job on this CD with his classic pop artistry. His voice is vibrant, intense and energetic. Michael Jackson deserves high praise for his music and this CD proves it.<br /><br />Michael starts off the CD strong with \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'.\\" The song has a catchy beat which draws in the listener so they want to hear more. Other great songs in both the pop style and even the rock and roll style include \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Beat It.\\" Moreover, Michael Jackson does a great duet with Paul McCartney on \\"The Girl Is Mine\\" and Michael works with Vincent Price for \\"Thriller.\\" Awesome!<br /><br />There are also beautiful love ballads: Michael sings \\"Human Nature\\" and \\"The Lady In My Life.\\" His sisters Janet Jackson and LaToya Jackson are just two of the background vocalists who help Michael on \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing).\\"<br /><br />The quality of the sound is excellent and the album flows well.<br /><br />This is a special edition of Thriller; and so there's much more material for us to enjoy. Quincy Jones gives extensive insight about the making of this album. Jones even talks about the relationships between producers and artists. The songwriter Rod Temperton tells how he wrote the rap lyrics for Vincent Price to perform in the song \\"Thriller.\\"<br /><br />There is a demo recording of \\"Billie Jean\\" by Michael which was recorded in his home in 1981, a year before this album was originally released. As one reviewer notes, the demo recording is a bit short but it gives great insight into how the song evolved from its initial conception to its final form. \\"Someone In The Dark\\" is based upon the movie \\"E.T.,\\" and we find out why \\"Carousel\\" was omitted from the album despite the fact that it is a great song. \\"Carousel\\" is on this CD which is another great bonus.<br /><br />The liner notes offer all the lyrics and song credits with a few great pictures of Jackson from 1981 and 1982.<br /><br />Overall this remains one of Jackson's best albums to date. The album demonstrates Michael's strong ability to perform and create music both in the pop and rock arenas. If you like this CD I highly recommend other Michael Jackson CDs including Bad and Off The Wall. Great job on this CD, Michael!best albums to date. The album demonstrates Michael's strong ability to perform and create music both in the pop and rock arenas. If you like this CD I highly recommend other Michael Jackson CDs including Bad and Off The Wall. Great job on this CD, Michael! <br />
0679411585|5.0|If you like non-fiction work detailing the bravery and hardships of individual soldiers on a battle field, this book is for you.<br /><br />This book describes the battle of around 450 man of the 1st battalion, 7th cavalry under the command of Then Lt. Col. Harold Moore, that were sent into the Ia Drang valley to hunt and kill enemy soldiers. They were unknowingly inserted in the middle of 3 north Vietnamese battalions with a combined force of 1600 well trained and aggressive soldiers that were in the area specifically looking to engage and kill American soldiers as a way to developing a methodology on how to fight the U.S. forces with their high tech planes and choppers. A second battle ensued only 3 days later and a few miles from the first battle, where a second U.S. battalion was again surrounded producing another savage battle with heavy casualty in both sides<br /><br />These forces clashed in such a violent way that in time was gruesome and heartbreaking to read. These soldiers were put in a situation where surrender wasn't an option. Injured men were being executed on the spot by the north Vietnamese. They were left with the only option of fighting to the end trying to inflict as much casualties as possible to the enemy, therefore increasing their chances of survival or a least making sure their deaths came at a high price.
006085880X|3.0|After reading My Sister's Keeper, I couldn't wait to get my hands on another novel by Jodi Picoult.  However, The Pact left me more than a little disappointed. <br /> <br />The premise is intriguing: two teenaged lovers so enmeshed that they are caught up in what seems to be a suicide pact, except one of them survives and is ultimately charged with the other's murder. <br /> <br />Em seems like a typical teenager, albeit a gifted artist, suffering through some difficult and emotional situations.  Unfortunately, I could not quite buy into the fact that she was so tormented that she simply had to die.  She had supportive parents, and although their expectations of her were certanly high, nothing they did seemed to imply that they would be anything less than that when faced with Em's past sexual abuse experience or her secret pregnancy.  Furthermore, she had Chris' parents, who were \\"like family\\" to her as was repeated throughout the book.  Even though Em was depressed and may have been suffering some additional mental illness, she was certainly not alone. <br /> <br />I also had a difficult time with Chris.  His love for and devotion to Em seemed very genuine, which is why it is so difficult to believe that he would \\"go along\\" with her suicide plan only to try to \\"be a hero\\" and save her at the last minute.  Perhaps the author intends readers to believe that he is so enmeshed with Em that he cannot think rationally, but I'm not convinced.  I think his love for her would have inspired him to find her the help she needed, regardless of Em's consequential feelings toward him for intervening. <br /> <br />The verdict in the court case was also farfetched, especially after Chris' testimony, but by then, my expectations were low. <br /> <br />This story had tremendous potential, which kept me hopeful page after page, but the character development was pretty shallow.  I kept seeking resolution to the unanswered questions I had, especially what the REAL reason was that Em wasdetermined to die, but the answer to that and other questions never came.
B000FTWB7G|2.0|The opening riff of \\"Even in Death\\" is a direct rip-off of the riff in Rob Zombie's song on the Beavis and Butthead movie soundtrack (you know, the music to Beavis' trip in the desert). I don't mean it sounds kind of like it, I mean it IS it. Shame on you, Amy. Quit trying to sound like a cheap imitation of all the great female fronted bands from Europe and quit ripping other people off. If Evanescence is your introduction to this kind of music do yourself a favor and check out The Gathering, Within Temptation, After Forever, Beseech (incidentally, Evanescence's logo looks suspiciously similar to theirs), Amaran, Epica, Nightwish, Asrai, To-Mera, Theatre of Tragedy, Leaves' Eyes, Elis, Edenbridge, Drain STH, Collide, Tapping the Vein, Draconian, Stream of Passion, Ambeon, Ayreon... and that's just a start. Once you've heard all these bands I think you'll agree that Evanescence is only the tip of a much better iceberg.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|I recently picked up a copy of this on vinyl at my local Goodwill (having given my original away years ago) for sentimental value.  After playing it the significance of this album came back to me.  Almost every song on the vinyl version was edited down as the songs were too long to fit onto the vinyl format.  I never realized this then until my father purchased this on cassette and played it over and over again in his truck as we traveled on our way to Canada for vacation.  I was astounded at how completely different the songs sounded.    As CDs were still a new and untried (and, in the end, overhyped) format I had just purchased a new CD player.  This was one of the first CDs I ever bought.  It was trumpeted as an \\"all digital recording\\" and at the time this was a truly big deal.  This was the album that made the CD format; this album was made with the CD format in mind.    As if that wasn't enough, its irony laden HUGE hit \\"Money for Nothing\\" (in which the irony, as in Springsteen's \\"Born in the USA\\", was lost), with Sting's mantra of \\"I want my MTV\\" ricocheting throughout, was the song that catapulted MTV into the mainstream.  MTV actually played music then (and was even somewhat controversial), artists such as Sting and Billy Idol popped on the screen from time to time to declare \\"I want my MTV\\" and the original boy bands such as Duran Duran were the stars of the video age so there was a double irony in that this song became so popular.      Though MTV was already growing in popularity (NBC even had its answer in \\"Friday Night Videos\\") and the music video becoming obligatory for up and coming artists, the video for this song was a HUGE hit on MTV all the way around and brought people to MTV who would probably have never been caught dead doing so to get in on the joke.  MTV, digital recordings, CDs, the death knoll of vinyl and albums with seven and eight minute songs were now all going mainstream.  It was all over; there was no going back.    As for the music itis a gem of an album.  Though the songs that became hits (\\"Money for Nothing\\", \\"So Far Away\\" and \\"Walk of Life\\") still stand the test of time in spite of the overkill of the time, the true gems are the longer, jazzy numbers that make up the rest of the album.  I never knew Mark Knopfler was quite the lyricist (\\"prehistoric garbage trucks have the city to themselves\\") and spins some wonderful tales.       It still holds up just as well today revealing the true musicianship of Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler.  One of the true gems that survived the 80s.
6300182355|5.0|Flash Gordon is a science fiction film with a European sensibility, more Barbarella than Star Wars. Two memorable scenes stand out among the enjoyable cheese: the deletion of Dr. Zarkov's memory, in which we see his life played on a monitor in reverse order past the Holocaust to the womb, and Ornella Muti in a red jumpsuit being flogged by her father's evil minions.
B000HCO83Q|1.0|This movie is boring.  No plot.  Just a bunch of special effects tied togeter under the x-men theme.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|This is a movie that's hard to \\"like,\\" but it certainly got my attention. Mike Nichols puts these four superb actors in a closed world, and explores the permutations of lust (and perhaps love), trust (and betrayal), forgiveness (and suspicion). Nichols sets up the characters and then tears them down--the predator Dan becomes the begging needy man as Alice (Natalie Portman) finally catches on to him; the cool, sophisticated, in-control Anna (Julia Roberts) becomes a woman who could have it all but doesn't want to be happy; and the rough-around-the-edges Clive Owen reveals himself as perhaps the most manipulative of all. There are parts of the film that don't quite ring true--how would you feel if you were picked up at a museum by a guy who does you-know-what in chat rooms? Anna doesn't seem to mind. But some things were all too true, such as the guys' reactions to infidelity, their insane focus on the gory details of the sex act without for a minute asking--What does this mean? We don't see anyone actually in bed, but that doesn't matter in this intensely sexual, at times raunchy film. As you see from the reviews, this movie excites strong reactions, and for that alone it's worth checking out.
B000H305U0|4.0|3.5 stars.  Justin succeeded in releasing a CD that doesn't sound like what everyone else is doing, but no one is really doing the same thing from Christina (the twenties thing and dropping Storch)-to Furtado (dropped the whole earthchild vibe)-to Janet (musically hooking up with JD).  The dance tracks are my favorites.  Though MY LOVE hauntingly reminds me of Eminem 'Superman'. WHAT GOES AROUND of course makes you wonder if he's talking about his ex 'pop-queen'-which I'm sure was done intentionally.  Sorry but I wasn't feeling CHOP ME UP or DAMN GIRL and the jury is still out on SUMMER LOVE and UNTIL THE END OF TIME.  (Maybe they'll grow on me.)  My interest pick back up on LOSING MY WAY ans ALL OVER AGAIN.  Overall, it's still a decent CD worth a listen to.
B000002KEV|5.0|This is Deep Purple live in the summer of 1972 when they were at the top of their game.<br /><br />This band was considered by many fans and critics to be the best live band of all time. See what all the fuss is about and get this disc right away. A recording that Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickenson called Deep Purple in full war cry!<br /><br />Essential rock music.
B0000028MA|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Cameron Crowe, not only for his great cinema but his devotion to music.  This soundtrack was the epitome of living in Seattle for me.  I listened to it in high school, wore it out in college while writing my best term papers, and continually revisit it to this day.  Singles was a great movie, but an even better soundtrack for the daily life of a Seattle-ite, or simply those who can appreciate good tunes.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|this album simply rocks. there is no sound out there thats as unique as Evanescence.
0786715103|5.0|I have read the reviews of some others here below that this book didn't have a good story line and looked to much like a dairy of this former general. <br /> <br />I agree but that is what puts this book aside from the others. As I work at the UN I know the (basic) frustrations that the he is experienced in his fight and by giving us a cold, day to day, story of how things happened, he actually managed to capture the frustration and disapointment that he wants us to experience.  <br /> <br />Most people say that it's a good review when they can not put a certain book down. For me this book was a completly different experience. I simply HAD to put it down, my frustration became to much.  <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone, its a lesson in humanity. It might be frustrating, disgusting and everything in between, but it should be a mandatory reading for every human being. <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This film is a continuation of the Firefly TV series, axed in its prime by  TV network executives who just didn't get it.    For details about the series, search for the Firefly DVD set here on Amazon, and read the reviews (mine first, of course!) Buy them both, but watch the series first! You will enjoy it more that way.    The story line is about a spaceship full of interesting characters squeaking past the law, trying to live free and do the right thing whenever possible. This film picks up a short time after the last TV episode, Objects in Space, and follows on very nicely with the story arc of the series.    To go into the story very deeply would give away too much. Suffice it to say that many of the smaller story arcs from the series (avaliable on Amazon in a boxed set) are resolved, and the series put to rest with a finish that would have made a beautiful season ender. There is an opening for more movies/projects based on the same \\"verse,\\" (short for Universe, show slang for the extremely interesting world/society/galaxy Joss and company created for the series). This 'verse consists of a blend of the old American West, Chinese culture (people speak Chinese and English interchangeably), old West technology and future space travel and related technology.    One would think the blend would simply not work, but it does work, and it works unbelievably well. The characters draw you in instantly, and hold your attention through the entire series and movie, leaving you wanting more. I have watched Serenity (the movie - the first section of the DVD series set is also called Serentiy, but is different) so many time I have lost count (not as much as Howard Hughes watched Ice Station Zebra, rest assured, but lots). (Which reminds me - the recent movie about Hughes is also great.)    In the movie you will see some things clarified, some things teasingly dangled in front of you and then buried (for future projects?), and at least two primary parts of the story arc resolved. It will make you laugh and cry, be happy and angry, leaving you feel very much a part of the lives of the characters. I won't give you details about the story line because that would take too much of the fun away. Great surprises and twists in store!    I haven't been a Joss Whedon fan before, but I sure am now. I am going to go back and visit his previous series and see what I have been missing. I complain frequently that there is little or no good TV being made, but Joss proves me wrong. I just haven't found enough of his work. I am also going to keep an eye out for the actors in other projects, as they are all great as well.    Remember, I recommend you get this movie with the Firefly series and watch the series first. This movie really ought to be packaged together with the series, and I would love to see a boxed set with both, and some new featurettes. The extras included with the movie and the Firefly series are also interesting and leave you wanting more.
B000063S6Z|4.0|I HAD HIGH HOPES FOR THIS ALBUM SINCE I SAW IT HAD \\"JAM FOR THE LADIES\\" ON IT. SINCE I LIKED THE MIX OF THE SONG ON THE TOMB RAIDER:CRADLE OF LIFE SOUNDTRACK, I FIGURED I'D LIKE THIS VERSION. DON'T GET ME WRONG, THE SONG IS GREAT BUT YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO IT A FEW TIMES IN ORDER TO FULLY ENJOY IT. THE REST OF THE ALBUM IS OK, NOT BAD BUT NOT PERFECT.THOUGH, I WAS EXPECTING MORE OF A EURO/TECHNO SOUND. <br /> <br />
B00005JKOI|3.0|Back in the eighties, the decade that fashion messed up, there were a lot of \\"classic\\" high school films, and I'm starting to watch them now. Just to see what they were like. Pretty In Pink is the first one I've watched and if you can turn a blind eye to the fashion, then you'll realise that it's not actually that bad a film.<br /><br />But there's nothing new or shocking about the storyline. Molly Ringwald plays a girl who makes her own clothes and jewelry, and is quite poor. She's also an outcast at school. Andrew McCarthy plays Blaine, quite a rich guy, who falls for Molly's character, Andie, despite the protest of his also rich best friend. They get together, split up, and get back together at the prom, the staple of high school movies. Duckie (played by Jon Cryer) as a crush on Andie, and resents Blaine muscling in on \\"his girl\\".<br /><br />There's not much else to say about Pretty In Pink, except it's well worth watching if you remember the eighties and the terrible fashion, or if you can identify with the film. We've all been through high school after all.
B0007Y08PQ|5.0|this movie is true beauty...one that surpasses the superficial...(unlike 'first contact')...this was my favorite of the 'next gen' movies, with 'nemesis' being at the top of the 'waste of time' list (was anything in that movie not stolen from somewhere else?...), followed by 'first contact'(the worst villans ever created), and then 'generations', with 'genrations' only making it to second place on a really 'warped' bell-curve... <br /> <br />'generations' had so many holes in the storyline it wasn't even funny...(why didn't they go back while he was still on the ship, instead of five seconds before he was about to fire again...and why was picard so insistant on wanting to go back, when everyone said he would only want to stay...and, did they really come back to the planet, or were they still in the nexus, and kirk didn't really die...)...too many questions, very few answers...and yet, it still comes in second place...(that says alot about the other two...) <br /> <br />but...then there's 'insurrection', a movie that some critics and fans took umbrage at, but, it is indeed the most perfect one from the new bunch...it has a wonderful storyline, with a good lesson behind it (as all good 'trek' should), plus, it had a decent villian (at least he was interesting, unlike the bored borg...), and, except for one silly moment that has riker driving the enterprise with a 'joystick', the movie features action and a cohesivness in the script, and between the entire cast, as well... <br /> <br />so, for those of you who still take 'umbrage', give it another shot...and discover the beauty that lays within...
0618680004|3.0|I am entirely sympathetic to Richard Dawkins's atheism.  I believe he is correct to point out that much of fundamentalism involves an authoritarian mindset that easily lends itself to intolerance, war and genocide.  God as Heavenly Father who slaughters in huge numbers and sends millions to hell is not a God I would worship if I thought he did exist.  But where Dawkins goes wrong is in dismissing all other possibilities.  Eastern religion, for instance, is based on experiences and conceptions of Brahman-Atman/Nirvana/Tao/buddhanature that do not at all resemble the Western &#34;Wrathful Desert God.&#34;  Personally, I do not consider myself a theist, or an atheist, or an agnostic.  I reject the theism-based set of concepts altogether -- it seems to me that Reality eludes the attempt to box it with that language.  The Buddha refused to address the question of &#34;God&#34; because he did not think it was fruitful.  I experience something greater than myself which leads to awe and humility on &#34;my&#34; part, which connects me with all sentient beings in interbeing, and connects me with love, compassion and wisdom (though there is no &#34;I,&#34; strictly speaking) -- it seems that this religious feeling is not something Dawkins has experienced.<br /><br /> Militant atheism is too much a reactionary response to fundamentalist theism -- what we need is another way that is not trapped in this war.  We are all sisters and brothers, we are the left and right hand of the same Universe, regardless of our concepts, and we should remember that with love and compassion.<br /><br /> J.L. Mackie's THE MIRACLE OF THEISM remains, despite Dawkins, the best summary of the traditional atheist philosophical arguments.  RELIGION EXPLAINED by Pascal Boyer is a brilliant study of the variety of religious beliefs, what people believe in and what they don't (see my review).  I recommend David Ehrenfeld's THE ARROGANCE OF HUMANISM for all atheists and humanists, an environmentally oriented challenge from a biologist and devout Jew.  Anything by Ken Wilber, including his new INTEGRAL SPIRITUALITY, points beyond the theism/atheism dichotomy.  The first section of David Ray Griffin's REENCHANTMENT WITHOUT SUPERNATURALISM is superb on the limitations of Cartesian empiricism, and it is rooted in our daily lived experience (see my review).  A KEY TO WHITEHEAD'S PROCESS AND REALITY, Alfred North Whitehead's metaphysical magnus opum edited for comprehensibility by Sherburne, is a more abstract exposition of the same point.  Whitehead's process philosophy gave rise to the process theology of Cobb, Griffin and others, a Christian metaphysics that transcends Biblical literalism.<br /><br /> Peace, shalom, salaam, namasthe.iologist and devout Jew.  Anything by Ken Wilber, including his new INTEGRAL SPIRITUALITY, points beyond the theism/atheism dichotomy.  The first section of David Ray Griffin's REENCHANTMENT WITHOUT SUPERNATURALISM is superb on the limitations of Cartesian empiricism, and it is rooted in our daily lived experience (see my review).  A KEY TO WHITEHEAD'S PROCESS AND REALITY, Alfred North Whitehead's metaphysical magnus opum edited for comprehensibility by Sherburne, is a more abstract exposition of the same point.  Whitehead's process philosophy gave rise to the process theology of Cobb, Griffin and others, a Christian metaphysics that transcends Biblical literalism.     Peace, shalom, salaam, namasthe.
B00006G8HX|5.0|o.k...assuming you have seen 'star trek two:wrath of khan', then you have to see this film, which is basically, part two of that movie... <br /> <br />but, taking it on face value, i thought the plotline and structure was excellent, with christopher lloyd as the klingon high-commander (and, if you pay attention, one of his henchmen aboard his ship is played by none other than John Laroquette from 'night court')...\\"impressive\\" <br /> <br />yes, 'wrath of khan' was very good (although the casting of kirk's son was unforgivable, and unwatchable...) <br /> <br />and yes, '#4:the voyage home' was alot of fun (but it doesn't really hold up as much today as it did then...) <br /> <br />but this one has some of the finest 'trek' moments on screen, including the destruction of the enterprise, and robin curtis filling in for the also terrific kirstie alley... <br /> <br />and besides '#6: the undiscovered country' (which, by all counts was THE definitive 'trek' movie, bar none, don't even think about questioning that one), this movie ranks number two in my book for the original generation... <br /> <br />live long and...oh you know...
0385510438|4.0|I was able to read this book in two sittings. Mr. Grisham writing style has improved quite a bit. And I have always liked it. This book takes place in the south in the seventies. A young man just out of college without graduating and moves to a small town where he takes a job on a county paper. The county is in Mississippi, Grisham's old stomping grounds. <br /> <br />This young man, Willie Traynor, ends up being the narrator of our story that takes us through almost a decade of life and turmoil in this town. He ends up owning the paper and interacting with a lot of interesting characters. He makes good friends with the Ruffin family who is God fearing and raised eight children. Seven of which earned PhD's. And runs afoul of the most nefarious family in the county. <br /> <br />We watch Willie grow up before our eyes; there is some courtroom drama and suspense. The plot is definitely character driven. And Gresham tries to put in a twist, but I found it a little to easy to figure out long before I reached the end. (I will not tell you where I figured it out, for that will ruin the ending for you. But the clues are there.) <br /> <br />The Ruffin family is endearing, but the Mississippi in the early seventies was still pretty much segregated. I would love to have known the Miss Callie Ruffin character. This book is definitely worth reading. <br />
B000022TSV|5.0|An amazing visual feast - a palette of tawny burnt golds and sunsplashed white, relieved by the earth tones of the villagers' dresses and the grey-green of the uniforms...no pinks or purples here! Just a dash of red in the blooded bulls...and the only blue is the muted blue of Michaela's dress (the virginal one?) And those incredible towns and villages, and the vast striated rockfaces in the countryside. This is the land where the relentess sun beats into brains and perhaps turns everyone a little mad.  <br /> <br />Wonderful little touches: dramatic duets sometimes sung by the couple in the distance while in the foreground the villagers work quietly at their tasks and the dogs wander about: the infants brought to the tobacco factory by their mothers, kept safe in cane walking frames or lying in cots... <br /> <br />But how can I write two paragraphs and not mention MUSIC??? Because I believe that this filmic rendering is actually truer to the heart of opera than many a stage production. Nowadays with our full-realism movie experiences we enjoy opera mainly for the music and silently forgive the limitations of stage sets and scenery. But opera is not only a series of arias. The wrenching emotional dramas were as important to those audiences  as the musical medium. Surely if Bizet could have used movie cameras, he would have created something like this experience.  <br /> <br />Anyway, musically, Domingo is splendid: Raimondi is excellent as Escamillo: on his first appearance you sense true musical authority. Carmen...she gives great hipswings, but the voice doesn't quite have the power this gypsy wildcat needs. Lorin Maazel's interpretation I like except for his too-fast tempo in the entrance of the toreadors:  a scramble instead of a pageant. <br /> <br />Overall, not a Carmen to miss! I had no idea what to expect and was riveted from the introductory bullfight.
0316168815|5.0|I can quibble over what I perceive as certain flaws in the book.  The male characters are generally bland, some of the key scenes are cut too short, and the waxing poetic goes on a little too long for my tastes in some parts.  But as I said, this is quibbling.  What was most significant for me was the unbelievable emotions this book stirred and it's going to take me a while to get why that is (I just finished it a couple of hours ago as I write this).  Sadness mixed with joy mixed with grief mixed with wonderment - often all together.  Alice Sebold is a touching and gifted writer who has created an unbelievably moving experience in this book.  It's magical.
0393327655|5.0|I can honestly say that reading \\"Letter to a Christian Nation\\" was my prime motivation to purchase and read this book.<br /><br />When \\"End of Faith\\" first came out, I ignored it as just another \\"atheist\\" argument for the suspension of rational thought and continued inquiry.  Yes, you read that correctly.  However, I was wrong about this book.<br /><br /> As a devout Christian who belongs to one of the most reviled \\"cults\\" in the history of mankind (I'm a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, yes, a \\"Mormon\\", and yes, I know most of you are ROFLYAO), I typically find very little value in most of \\"intellectual\\" diatribes against religion, just as I find very little value in most of the \\"religious\\" diatribes against evolution, etc.  I've found that a vast majority of people have simply closed their minds and write only to support their conclusions (i.e. Dawkins, et al).  You should note I've read, but not publicily reviewed, books by Mr. Dawkins.  I mention this only to help you understand my review.<br /><br />This book is unquestionably a diatribe against religion.  However, it is the first of such \\"modern\\" books (at least, that I've read) that uses reason and logic to create an honest argument and to apply the same to *all* religions, of which I consider \\"Atheism\\" to be one.  A \\"religion\\" is not the same thing as a \\"school of thought\\".  This book is much more eloquent in making that point.<br /><br />I found myself in wholehearted agreement with the author in over 90% of his reasoning and opinions.  That is more than I find in most conversations with people who are of my own faith!<br /><br />If you believe yourself to be a rational person, you must read this book.  His criticisms and analyses are becoming more and more relevant as time passes.  There is no question that he is absolutely correct about where our country, our leaders and the entire world is heading.  His honesty and bravery, yes, bravery, in writing this book lead me to say, \\"Three cheers for Sam Harris!\\"<br /><br />I do, of course, not agree with everything. :)  But, I'm not a famous author, I'm not a well known celebrity/scientist/journalist/anything and I'm not one of the \\"top\\" Amazon reviewers.  So, who cares?  That's the problem.  \\"Who cares?\\".me to say, \\"Three cheers for Sam Harris!\\" <br /> <br />I do, of course, not agree with everything. :)   But, I'm not a famous author, I'm not a well known celebrity/scientist/journalist/anything and I'm not one of the \\"top\\" Amazon reviewers.

B0000028PL|5.0|Living Colour after the album Time's up were in a place where they could have been radio friendly and quite popular - they had some great songs before - pushing the envelope as such as to what popular music was and made some great rock stuff. <br /> <br />Then with the adoption of Tackhead/On-U sound Bassist Doug Wimbish - a very progressive and way out outfit came this album which was very much a generation ahead of just about anything else out there.  And now still this CD sounds like it was released yesterday - it's absolutely brilliant - moody, sharp, edgy, fun, whatever - it's musically extremely high level with some incredible players but it maintains some terrific songs. <br /> <br />You get enough from the first four songs - they are brilliant - so fresh in their sound.  Incredible from start to finish - with another highpoint being 'nothingness'  - a masterpiece in the centre of the album recorded with the guitar played into a satellite dish. <br /> <br />Best album for them by far, but all this bands stuff is brilliant.  Perhaps not for everyone but worth a try for sure.
1400032717|5.0|This has to be one of my all-time favorite books! It was pleasure to read. Thank you, Mark Haddon, for writing such a great book!!
B000002I25|5.0|Everyone knows the original Doors album.  The haunting vocal melodies and the distinct rock sound was unheard of back in the late 60's, and teenagers back then really enjoyed the unique sound of the band. <br /> <br />Today, teenagers STILL enjoy the Doors.  This album is especially interesting to everyone.  Please pick it up and enjoy.
0375703861|4.0|Extremely insightful, witty, relevant, and pleasurable to read with the one major caveat that all the white women in the novel are one dimensional walking stereotypes who basically show up to seduce Muslim men and then crawl away with no real exploration of their motives or thought processes by the author, unlike the ones afforded to all the novel's other characters. Keeping this criticism in mind, read the book and enjoy it. Just try and find a white female character in the novel whose behavior doesn't follow this trajectory.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|Just got done watching Thank You For Smoking. This movie was simply hilarious from beginning to end. I love the dark and very smart humor. It was well written, had a fantastic cast and the acting was superior. Now as I am writing this and thinking that this movie was just great and flawless... I remember one glaring FLAW. Katey Holmes was completely and totally miscast. I can only imagine that she got the role because of her recent publicity filled relationship with the grinny idiot Tom Cruise and their sham relationship. The character is described by somebody in the cast before you even meet her as this bombshell babe of a reporter with great chest that would melt and had melted many a man into spilling his guts. So who do we get? Who is this brick you know what house that can seduce any man? Why it is 14 year old looking and acting Katey 'Kate' (to her grinning ingnoramous of a sudo husband) Holmes. I don't think much of her in any role unless it is of a 14 year old and certainly she was totally miscast in this movie that has cast every other character dead on. I cannot, for the life of me, imagine them filling this cast with Aaron Ekhart, Robert Duvall, Rob Lowe, Sam Elliot, Maria Bello or anybody else in this top notch cast and then saying, \\"you know who we should get for the bombshell sexpot reporter?!!! Why let's get KATEY HOLMES!!!\\" And somebody saying, \\"I have to have her! She is our first and only choice!\\" Give me a break.<br /><br />The best thing is that even this total miscasting did not hurt this movie. It is 5 stars and Oscar worthy.
B00000JPYD|5.0|This is a must have album for anyone who likes classic rock, because this is just as good as anything that came out of the 60s or 70s. Those who dubbed Robin Trower as the next Hendrix hit it right on the dot. Bye no means am I saying this is better then Hendrix because really nobody is, but this is some amazing music. Robin Trower found some great band mates to form this band because they sound great together. Who ever thinks this is not a great album doesn't know a thing about music. The louder you play it the better it sounds. Rock On!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0307277887|5.0|I loved this book.  It had everything one could ask for in a murder mystery/suspense novel, and it was fun on top of it.  Dexter was adopted by a cop when he is 4.  He witnessed something that he can't remember but the effects of his earlier life leave him lacking a few things.  Nothing important really, just a conscience, compassion, empathy, ability to love.  You know, the little things in life that separate us from wild beasts.  Try as you might, you just can't help but love this guy in spite of it all. It's the whole bad boy thing on steriods.  He is all grown up now and works for the police department as a blood spatter technician.  His step-sister, Deb, is a cop who wants so badly to become a detective and leave behind her glamorous life working vice as an undercover hooker.<br /><br />The premise of this book is fresh and new, which is why I am giving it 5 stars.  Dexter is a serial killer who stalks serial killers.  His adopted father Harry, recognized there was something lacking in young Dexter and channeled this evil to work for the good of mankind in a weird, sick kind of way.  This is revealed in the beginning of the story, so I am not spoiling anything for you.  The journey through this book is about introducing our characters, and finding out what has made Dex the monster he is today.  It shows the struggle between Dexter the killer and Dexter who only wants to hurt those who hurt others.  The book is a breath of fresh air and a joy to read.  I can't wait to dive in to the sequel.  You are missing out on one of the best mystery/suspense books written in while, if you pass on this one.
B000003TA4|1.0|Bands from the 90s just sucked and Nirvana fits in with that. They had a couple of ok songs and Kurt Cobain was some what talented but this is nothing to get excited about. I can not for the life of me see the things people see that just go off about how great they were. I don't see it. This is another cd in a long line of cds from the 90s that are a disgrace to music.
B000GY729M|5.0|It is quite undeniable that these guys deserve all the raves they are getting. When I listened to this album, I heard shades of Supertramp, Queen and the Who. Don't ask me why, I probably could have gone on with other examples of what I heard but succinctly put this is an excellent album every song flowed seamlessly into the other. This CD should really be made into some type of epic video because the songs tell a story. It conjured up many images in my head. Brandon Flowers has an unique voice and the band is tight. Definitely worth the ride into Sam's Town.
B000058983|5.0|When this ablum came out on plastic 12\\". I listened to it and called my friends Charly, Jimmy, Florance, Kevyn and Ted. You just gotta hear this, it's amazing!They all drove over to my house and I played Forever Changes.  Everybody's mouth dropped open. When the album was over, all you could hear was \\"play it again Bill, play it again\\". Simply amazing, nothing before it or after it has ever been like Love Forever Changes, A true Classic with unforgetable lyrics.
B000HBKCDC|2.0|I'd be irate if I would only stay awake long enough to notice. Stupefyingly devoid of any emotion other than monotony, her withered gossamer tones mewl standard holiday fare no better or worse than the lead in the Macy's Christmas Choir, with longtime McLachlan menace Pierre Marchand on board to helm this snoozefest with his usual flair for over-saturation. They're all here, from the traditionalist `The First Noel' and `Oh Little Town Of Bethlehem' and, of course, `Silent Night', to her sucking the joy right out of `Christmas Time Is Here' to the umpteenth remakes of `River' and `Happy Xmas [War Is Over]' the latter two reaching new heights [lows] of languidness. The real clinker is the self-penned `Wintersong', her seasonal contribution I am steadfast her rabid fan base will swallow like Christmas pudding. Oh, yeah - downgraded for employing the over-rated Diana Krall on a cut. The cover art is pretty, though. My grade: C-
B000EHRVP6|4.0|Sex-obsessed American youth culture collides with European intellectualism. Two American boys on a sexual holiday in Amsterdam run afoul of a \\"hunting\\" club that serves up human victims to jaded thrill seekers. The American survivor of the sadistic, bloody adventure learns with a vengeance and becomes the thing that nearly killed him. CAUTION: The unrated version of Hostel includes a great deal of nudity and extreme, graphic violence. Recommended for those who are looking for a really unusual film and can tolerate on-camera dismemberments.
B000G759LW|3.0|I was really expecting a great follow up from stripped.  Had this been 1 cd it probably would have been close, however there are a lot of songs that i find myself skipping over.   <br />After a week of listening to it, the songs are starting to grow on me, but there are still a lot that could have been cut off. <br />Its a good cd, but i expected a lot better.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Fans of futuristic action will not be disappointed with this film; While it offers some of the most memorable gunfights in recent cinema history, it also boasts great perrformances; As usual, Christian Bale brings credibility to a film that could go so wrong in another actor's hands; You read his anguish in his face, his clenching jaw...he puts himself emotionally into his role and sells it. Taye Diggs hits all the right marks as Bale's partner, and Watson is great for the little screen time shes given. Too bad Sean Bean wasn't used more...This movie could have been extremely silly, but the people involved cared enough to make it both a film with action and depth.
B000AMWIVM|5.0|I bought this movie not thinking it would be very good, but I think this was the first movie I have ever watched a second time right after watching it for the first time, I was loving it the whole way through ,and just when you think it can't get any better , THE ENDING comes out of nowhere, Never SAW that coming ,some people can usually predict the ending on some movies ,but I don't think anyone could have possibly seen this coming. This is one of the BEST movies i've ever seen.
B00005AWMF|5.0|Sade was and still is the epitomy of a grand lounge singer- and that is said with respect and awe.  No one sings a song like Sade and no one has come close to capturing the depth of despair and loneliness prevelant in so many of her songs.  I can't speak for anyone, but one thing I know for sure- this lady will always have the distinct honor of recording the soundtrack to so many gay men's lives.
0375757856|5.0|Among its many other delights, this book has my favorite \\"butler-narrator\\" in all of fiction, Gabriel Betteredge.  Betteredge's insights into the British upper classes are downright hilarious.    Take, for example, the passage in which he describes Miss Rachel and Mr. Franklin's newfound passion for decorative painting.  After noting that the lives of the British gentlefolks are spent, for the most part, \\"in looking about them for something to do,\\" he goes on:     \\"Nine times out of ten they take to tortuing something or spoiling something -- and they firmly believe they are improving their mind, when the plain truth is, they are only making a mess in the house.  I have seen them . . . go out, day after day, for example, with empty pillboxes, and catch newts and beetles and spiders and frogs, and come home and stick pins through the miserable wretches, or cut them up, without a pang or remorse, into little pieces. . . . . As for Mr. Franklin and Miss Rachel, they tortured nothing, I am glad to say.  The simply confined themselves to making a mess; and all they spoilt, to do them justice, was the panelling of a door.\\"     Betteredge has the loyalty of all good British butlers, but it's a tongue-in-cheek sort of loyalty.  At one point, the main detective in the story makes a case against Miss Rachel.  I love Betteredge's response, in which he advises the reader to \\"cultivate a superiority to reason\\":    \\"It was downright frightful to hear him piling up proof after proof against Miss Rachel, and to know, while one was longing to defend her, that there was no disputing the truth of what he said.  I am (thank God!) constitutionally superior to reason.  This enabled me to hold firm to my lady's view, which was my view also.\\"    The witty narrative voices and the whodunnit plot make this a fun and fast read.
B000089RVX|5.0|Just a line or so : Its a point of some note that years after the release of this CD, we are all listening to it and its made the Top 50 of Amazons' sales chart at the end of 2006! Whoa.<br /><br />I remember cruising down the Naples-Fort Myers interstate (beautiful road) when I first heard \\"Bring me to life\\" and like many others was affected by Amys' voice.<br /><br />However, many tracks on this CD are much more stellar than that lead single.<br /><br />The song that kills me is \\"My Immortal\\". What beauty, what lyricism, and thank you Evanescence for bringing melody back to the American rock scene. If you havent got this already, well get it now!
B000002VC3|4.0|This is an album of nostalgia, AP proved came with this catching album we still hear today, back then I thought the album would live because of Old and Wise as well as Silence and I. I have not been wrong in my prediction, as far as Old and Wise was played in their recent concert in Caracas last year.<br /><br />My 13 yo son is now into hearing AP, as a relieved parent seeing this as a radical change from RAP, which is of course based on primitivism, violence and negation of anything of value. i would encourage all you parents to steer your kids into AP, its melodic, fun, and the perfect intro to prog or other higher music
B000FTWB7G|4.0|OK, I'm gonna make this a very short review for those of you who are thinking about buying this CD. If you find this useful, please click on the button below the review.<br /><br />First off, if you liked \\"Fallen\\", then get this BLINDLY. Its much better, and Amy's voice is magnified much more here, and not buried under too much instrumentation (lead single is an obvious example).<br /><br />However, if recent rock releases like Audioslave have disappointed you, then this album will restore your faith in American goth-rock once again. I wouldn't say its a timeless classic, but if you pop this in your car, there is not a single song you will want to skip over, I guarantee you that.<br /><br />Only downside, sometimes the music here is a little too pop-ish and pretty, like Amy Lee thinks shes some sort of fairy or something. Now thats not a bad thing, but it sort of gets in the way of this CD being a powerhouse album like it could have been.<br /><br />The way it stands, this is definitely the bands' best work so far, and one of the superior rock albums this decade for sure.<br /><br />No doubts, just buy.
1594200106|5.0|My book club read this book, and, although I missed the meeting where we discussed it, I am forever grateful to the person at my club who suggested it. She didn't think I would like it as she said the book required imagination (which, apparently, in her opinion, I am lacking, hmmmm). She couldn't have been more wrong though -- about my liking the book. Even if you have no imagination, this book will give it to you. I don't know why the other reviewers don't like it as much -- yes, there are a lot of subplots, but it's all truly fascinating. It further confirms my belief that a lot of contemporary great fiction was originally written in Spanish (think Allende, Marquez, Borges). This book takes you to another world. It is a real escape. The two main plots -- one set in the past -- mirror each other, and I think the ultimate point of the book is that, in the end, the present-day character, chooses differently. Of course, one of our favorite sub-plots is in here -- I don't want to give it away, but let's just say it's one of those things that's present in a lot of great and bad books. But it's done really well in here and treated appropriately, whereas in other books it's trotted out for shock value and lack of any other decent plot. Here, it made sense and was drawn well. Anyway, read the book, and you'll know what I'm talking about. You're gonna love the book though. It's truly a \\"gorgeous\\" read.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I really liked this album, the songs were meanigful, I found I could relate to them, but there were some notable differences, for example, in the song Lacrymosa, the line : can this be really what you wanted, BABY.  Those words of affection are not usually used in Evanescence.  And in the song Like You, she says: I long to be like you, SIS.  I know Amy Lee had a young sister who died when she was small, and the song Hello on the Fallen album is dedicated to her, and this one too probably, but even in the Hello song things were left vage, so that it's not sister relating to sister, but so that it can be wife to husband, husband to wife, father to daughter, daughter to father, etc.  But the songs were still amazing, especially Snow White Queen.  It was the first one I listened to and I still love it the most.  That and Sweet Sacrifice, Your Star, Like you, and All that I'm Living for.
0345475674|4.0|I never would have guessed that an aquaduct could be so interesting, but discussions of water in \\"Pompeii\\" held me rapt. Not only was it fast paced and enthralling, it is fascinating to see how dependent the mighty Roman civilization was on its high tech (for the time) water system.  <br />The main character, an earnest young engineer, is likeable and engaging. The female lead is a somewhat stereotypical fiery and rebellious girl. The villains are suitably disgusting, but not too interesting. The most terrifying villain is the looming Mt. Vesuvius, which any modern reader can expect to errupt, burying nearby towns in ashes and lava. The volcanic eruption is the true climax of the story, more frightening than any human's plot.  <br />Obviously well-researched, \\"Pompeii\\" is a Roman thriller well worth a read.
B00005JPBP|5.0|Wow.  This movie is awesome.  The Twists and turns are just awesome.  I really like how Nolan connected it all together.  If you guess one twist you get hit by 3 more you didn't see coming.  I loved it.  The action, suspense, mystery, drama.  Christopher Nolan is becoming one of the best directors out there. <br /> <br />The acting is fantastic.  Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, and Michael Caine all are great.  I love the accent on Bale's character.  The biggest achievement for me though was that I forgot I was watching Batman, Wolverine, Gollum, and Alfred.  I really felt I knew these characters.  That is a huge credit to Nolan and the actors.  I actually think Jackman is a great actor now and not just a great action actor.  He gives a helluva performance.  Bale is also extraordinary.  I could keep going on and on, but I'll stop.  Just go see this movie.  I smell Oscars!  <br /> <br /> <br />Oh.  Do not GO TO THE BATHROOM OR LEAVE THE THEATRE!!!!!!!!!!!  If you do you might miss a big twist(they happen a lot).
0062502182|4.0|A quick and easy, enjoyable read.  This book would be best placed in the young adult fantasy section of the library. <br /> <br />The hero pursues his greatest destiny despite his fears, and good things happen.  Even when bad things happen, they end up being good things.  A simplistic message, but a powerful one none the less. <br /> <br />Entertainment: 3 stars <br />Enlightenment: 4 stars <br />Overall: 4 stars <br /> <br />To readers that enjoyed this book, I would recommend the movie 'Forest Gump'.
0743298020|5.0|This is one of the finest novels I've read since college, and that I haven't read anything this good since college has nearly embarrassed me into going back.    Ms. Setterfield writes with the sure hand of a seasoned novelist. Writing in the first person, according to many editors, is difficult because you have to maintain that voice throughout the entire book. It cannot wax or wane, and more so than in a third person narrative, the character at all times - because we are in his/her head at every juncture - needs to be true to his/her core identity. Harder yet is to tell a story with two first person narrators, as the reason given above is considerably magnified.     Yet Ms. Setterfield demonstrates remarkable facility in handling both narrators and they are true to their core identities from beginning to end. There is Ms. Winter, one of the most successful and respected writers of her time, and the overall narrator, Margaret Lea, her commissioned biographer.    Without question, the more enticing of the two is Vida Winter's narrative as told to Margaret Lea, mostly because of its content (it is the main story, after all, so it should be more enticing...) but also because of her fierce desire for the true story of her life to be told. When we meet Ms. Winter, we realize that she was named aptly, for she is a cold and distant woman. And yet when Margaret decides that she is in no mood to be manipulated by Ms. Winter, as Ms. Winter has beguiled many reporters seeking the story of her life, Ms. Winter's coldness drops as if it is nothing more than a façade, and the desperate honesty of her plea causes Margaret to reconsider.    Margaret reconsiders with on one condition: that Ms. Winter provide her with three facts that no one knows about her, and are verifiable, and that will ultimately prove that Ms. Winter is being honest with her. One cannot help but develop a sense of respect for Margaret that may not have existed until then.    What unfolds is a remarkable storyworthy of Ms. Setterfield's admitted inspirations (well, Margaret's inspirations, but it is Ms. Setterfield's story) - the Bronte sisters, George Eliot (Marian Evans), and others. The story also pays homage to Henry James' The Turn of the Screw, in the sense that the aforementioned story is easily the finest ghost story ever written. One doesn't get a sense that Ms. Setterfield has any ambition to out-write any of these authors, but rather to humbly submit something that may be spoken of in their company.    I think she succeeded.    What is remarkable to me is that in a literary world littered with Dan Brown's and Mitch Albom's, such a literate, well written story (indeed, within the first paragraph I knew I was in trustworthy hands) could not only appear on the New York Times bestseller list, but lay claim to the top spot in its very first week.
B0001HAHXW|4.0|Why am I reading so many negative reviews of this CD?  This is SO MUCH better than most anything Eric Claptton has recorde over the last twenty-twenty five years.  Here is the music, stripped down and played the right way.  I particuularly like the cuts where he plays slide guitar.  Robert johnson would be proud to hear his music done right.
0385751060|3.0|fable <br />noun  <br />1.  story that teaches a lesson: a short story with a moral, especially one in which the characters are animals  <br />2.  legend: a story about supernatural, mythological, or legendary characters and events  <br />3.  false account: a false or improbable account of something  <br />*  His version of events turned out to be a complete fable.  <br />4.  myths and legends: myths and legends collectively  <br />*  a character out of fable  <br /> <br />John Boyne rather boldly announces on the title page that this is a fable. It's rather easy to look at the four general definitions above and pick which one he had in mind as he was writing this. But upon finishing the book, I'm left to wonder if this story was nothing more than #3 - a false or improbable account of something. <br /> <br />Before reading the book, I skimmed some of review titles here on Amazon, and approached the book with caution. It wasn't long before I abandoned all caution, as I fell in love with the character of nine year old Bruno and his take on the world, sometimes naïve, where his sister is \\"a Hopeless Case\\", the character of Hitler is known to him as \\"the Fury\\", Auschwitz is \\"Out-With\\", and other understandings that are at least warm and often funny. The titles of the chapters certainly proclaim the intent of this \\"fable\\" aligning itself with the first definition, as they share characteristics with many of Aesop's and other fables, although they often fall short, e.g., \\"The Dot That Became a Speck That Became a Blob That Became a Figure That Became a Boy\\". <br /> <br />We met the boy in the striped pajamas, who, incidentally, is the boy referenced in the chapter title above, nearly halfway through the story. If it hadn't been for Bruno's delightful characterizations, that would have been very frustrating, but still, the book is about \\"The Dot That Became...a Boy\\", and we in my humble opinion we should have met him earlier. <br /> <br />The story: Bruno lives with his parents and his sister, the Hopeless Case, in a big house in Berlin. His father is a high ranking official in what we know to be the Nazi party, but Bruno, a nine year old, knows nothing of that. One evening the Fury has dinner with Bruno's parents and his father is now a Commandant. Soon they are relocated to Out-With, and Bruno is not at all pleased. Berlin was full of life, and literally (tragically) Out-With is not. The house that his family lives in at Out-With in no way compares to the house in Berlin, where there were dozens of yet-to-be-discovered nooks and crannies. This new house has nothing worth exploring, and Bruno fashions himself quite the explorer. <br /> <br />Their house is also the only house as far as his eye can see, with the exception of some huts that are far beyond barbed wire fences. He sees people walking around in striped pajamas on the other side of the fence, and his young mind can't grasp what's happening there. Why are they all wearing the same clothes? Why, sometimes, when the guards are around does a person fall and have to be carried away. *We* know why, but he doesn't - he can't. His view on this is extremely refreshing, and I felt that Boyne handled it marvelously. <br /> <br />When Bruno finally decides to explore--although exploring around Out-With is barred With No Exception--he walks for what seems like miles and miles, where he can no longer see his house and even the huts behind the fences are behind him, he sees \\"the dot that became a boy\\", and they sit and talk. Bruno has many internal questions about the boy. Why is he so sad? Why is he so thin? Why is he so pale and gray? But Bruno knows, and this seems a little out of character for a child that Boyne has painstakingly painted as naïve, that sometimes people don't like to be asked these questions. <br /> <br />They develop a friendship, and Bruno treasures it. Almost every day they meet at the fence and talk for a short time, and Bruno often brings the boy food, which hedevours. Their conversations are some of the more interesting writing in the book, and highlight a very sobering fact: people believe what they are told, not what their eyes can see. <br /> <br />There is some drama between his sister, mother, father, and a young lieutenant that seems, at the end of the story, quite out of place, but the lieutenant's departure helps to set up a reason for the mother and children to return to Berlin. <br /> <br />The day before they leave for Berlin, Bruno sets out on one final adventure while he's there. <br /> <br />What happens after is one of the most disturbing and puzzling endings I've come across in a long time. There was also an Author's Note that I thought was going to clear things up but it didn't; frankly, I think it trivialized the entire story. The story didn't need to end that way, and I can't imagine why it did. <br />
B000H305U0|5.0|Justin Timberlake; a man hated on by many because of his past musical endeavors. I was personally disgusted by him and his fellow *NSYNCers. But, if it's good music I'll rock to it and support it all the way. And that's exactly what this album is. GOOD MUSIC! This is not just a CD, this is an album. It has direction, a sound, it flows. It's not just a bunch of random songs recorded, thrown on a CD, and given a title. This is accredited just as much to the greatest producer of all time, Timbaland, as it is to Mr. JT.  <br /> <br />The production is incredible lead by, once again, Timbaland along with some help from the Black Eyed Peas mastermind will.i.am and co-starter of the legendary Def Jam label Rick Rubin. The production was an amazing infusion of R&B, Hip-Hop, Soul & Dance. This may seem like a little too much to handle but it was done masterfully.    <br /> <br />The melodies on the album are very unique. At times using a similar sound of legends such as Prince & yes Michael Jackson, but for the most part much his own. Lyrically this album is also superb having a great mix of simple and deep lyrics. Some good examples of this are the tracks \\"Damn Girl\\" (simple) & Losing My Way (deep). Justin's voice is also amazing on the album especially his falsetto.  <br /> <br />Overall this is an album you can really put in and listen to from start to finish especially since you have so much change in the production because of the incredible interludes that could really past for songs themselves. The album never gets boring and if I was on the grammy commidy this would be my vote, thus far, for album of the year.  <br /> <br />Favorite Tracks <br />3. Sexy Ladies (a real old school, soul feel to it) <br />4. My Love (The second single and stand out song on the album) <br />7. Chop Me Up (Took me a minute to like, but gives an edge to the album) <br />8. Damn Girl (Track to let loose to for the fellas) <br />9. Summer Love (Possibly the best song & should be the third single) <br />10. Until The End of Time (Stand out slow jam) <br />11. Losing My Way (Deep and unexpectidly creative) <br />*BONUS TRACK Pose (Fun song) <br />
1592401791|1.0|With the exception of sometime employer Paul McCartney, no one escapes Emerick's petty, self-serving tirade. At times you almost get the impression that Emerick thinks that he and McCartney could have done as well without those other pesky people. Let's see, George Martin was a scene stealing sop who took credit for all of Geoff's wonderfulness, John was a space cadet, George was a subpar musician and Ringo was unfriendly. (In Ringo's defense, if Emerick is as graceless in person as he is on these pages, I'd avoid him too.) And even when Geoff deigns a compliment or two upon his colleagues at EMI it's always cloaked in an attitude of &#34;of course, it's not as good as what I would have done&#34;.<br /><br />Emerick had a wonderful opportunity to pen a truly insightful book on a grossly overwritten topic. Geoff is one of the few people with the first-hand knowledge that qualifies him to write a &#34;fly-on-the-wall&#34; account of those historical times but instead he let his ego and vanity dictate what is no more than a transparent tribute to himself and his mentor, friend and meal ticket, Paul McCartney.<br /><br />Emerick's ego and lopsided narrative doesn't stop with the Beatles, he pats himself on the back for his production on Badfinger's &#34;No Dice&#34; LP and then gives short shrift to the follow-up LP. Gee, I wonder if that's because his tracks were rejected by Apple and had to be turned over to George Harrison and re-worked by Todd Rundgren who managed to turn a hodge-podge of tracks into a listenable album. No mention from surly Geoff that the two stand out tracks from that LP, &#34;Day after Day&#34; and &#34;Baby Blue&#34; were Harrison and Rundgren productions.<br /><br />Frankly, the Beatles, McCartney and most of the EMI/Abbey Road staff deserved better.
0743298020|5.0|When I first started reading this book, I did not think I would like it.  I am willing to always read the first two chapters before I give up on a book.  After the first two chapters, I was hooked.  There were times I could not put the book down because I would be in the middle of a ghost story and be very suprised about how things were going, so forget what I was doing and just read.
B000GPI2EK|5.0|Ok, so I got into Mastodon a year ago when I heard about \\"Leviathan\\" while reading about Meshuggah somewhere. I loved the album, it scratched an itch that I didn't know I had. When I heard some of their new stuff I was kind of worried, but I kept positive. The day this CD came out, I was totally blown away. Every song on this CD has its place and their is a great progression towards the track \\"Siberian Divide\\", which totally pounded my face in. I love the mystical/natural feeling this album has. I really digged the whole blood/heart/body motif and the message of conquering something huge. I never thought I would hear another classic metal album after the semi-dissapointment of \\"10,000 Days\\" (I loved that album, Lateralus was way better though.). With \\"Blood Mountain\\" though, I have no need to worry about getting my prog fix anymore. Mastodon is here and is ready to bring prog back to the masses in a HUGE way.
0316743003|4.0|I've never been particularly interested in the topic of the book, but I bought this on a whim and sat down to read with a cup of coffee.  A couple of hours later the coffee was cold and the book was finished.  Fascinating look at the industry and at the people behind the engineering.
B00005ATQF|2.0|as someone said in an earlier review, the movie is split up into two parts.  the first part, training camp, was good. i enjoyed the movie up until it switches to vietnam.  after that, i found it unwatchable. the main character is so annoying, i kept hoping he would get shot instead of his supporting cast. if you're looking for a good war movie, look elsewhere.
630471193X|4.0|George Malley, played by John Travolta, is a nice enough guy but he is not exactly  the brightest crayon in the box. He is a well liked auto mechanic who tries hard but is not too good at anything except fixing cars. Then one day, when leaving his birthday party, he sees a light in the sky and then passes out.<br /><br />When he comes to, everything is different but it takes a while for him to put his finger on it. His concentration is better. He is able to retain what he reads. He has lots of bright ideas. Along with all of this, though, he cannot sleep. He spends all night reading and coming up with gadgets and theories. Most of them work.<br /><br />His friends notice things are different but they cannot shake the ideal of a dull George Malley. His intelligence makes them a bit jealous and then even frightens them. This is especially true when he manages to learn Portuguese in half and hour in order to save a lost child with food poisoning. They are sure they are afraid when he exhibits some telekinesis. Rumors abound.<br /><br />Most of the rumors center around the UFO George saw on the night of his change. That makes things scarier.<br /><br />George falls in love with a single mom and has a hard time winning her over. Eventually, though, he does because she can see his good heart. This is about the time that he comes under scrutiny from academic and government types. The academics want to study him and the government is frightened because they cannot control him. Things come to a head when it turns out that there is a very mundane explanation for the phenomenon and some medical types want to cut him up.<br /><br />This story has its happy moments and its share of sad ones as well. It a story of acceptance and character. In some case it is the story of the lack of those attributes.
0307237699|5.0|The Audacity of Hope by Senator Obama is a compelling arguement for reexamining how we view and respond to policy issues and political debate. Challenging us to leave our biases at the door before entering. The Senator does this in a manner similar to that of a pastor on sunday morning rebuking then showing and guilding us to a better way. An intellectual and insightful read with moments of hilarity (his decription of a bloggers response to Alan Keyes had me laughing out loud). I look forward to hearings more from him whether on the campaign trail or in the Senate.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|The story takes place in a world that never was. The time is around the time of the Second World War but that war seems not to have taken place. Dirigibles like the Hindinburg III still ply the airways. People wear trench coats and fedoras. Vehicles are streamlined and there is a Deco feel to everything.<br /><br />There is trouble in the air. Famous scientists are disappearing. One calls ace reporter Polly Perkins to give her a heads up and reveals that all of the missing scientists were part of a secret project in Germany after the first World War. He is the last one.<br /><br />When some huge mechanical monsters show up in New York City, the emergency call goes out to Sky Captain to come and save the day. He flies a modified P 40 Warhawk with neat, albeit 1940ish James Bond style modifications. He also leads a mercenary Sky Legion to protect America. He manages to damage one of the huge mechanical monsters and save the life of his former girlfriend, Polly.<br /><br />It turns out that the mechanical monsters are striking all over the world and stealing the oddest things like power plant generators and zoo animals. Something strange is clearly going on and Sky Captain and the Perky Polly Perkins are going to find out what it is.<br /><br />It is, of course, a mad scientist plot which takes them all over the world before they learn of his Noah's Ark scheme.<br /><br />The story is mediocre. What is engrossing is the stunning array of visual effects. Its as if an old pulp comic book has come to life. Most of this film consists of computer generated effects that are the cutting edge of modernity but the feel is anything but modern. The style, art, lighting and feel of the thing scream of a bygone age. That was wonderful to see. I wish the movie had been as well. The acting and effects are fine. The story was probably not all that good back in the 30s, 40s or 50s.
B0002TX4QQ|4.0|I have read this book once, and I need to read it again.  On my first read, I concentrated on trying to understand Kevin and his relationship with his mother, Eva.  While I gained some insights, I suspect that I did not obtain much understanding.<br /><br />Next time I read it, I want to try to concentrate on how Lionel Shriver has actually managed to convey such a complex picture of life and of motivation.<br /><br />The writing is superb.  The issues introduced are both challenging and confronting.<br /><br />What might lead a teenager to murder?  This novel raises more questions than answers, but does so in a way that invites reflection.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
B000002G7E|5.0|If you're a VU fan and you haven't heard this album, be it from bad reviews or people just plain saying it's hard to listen to, you should still give it a try. For one thing, Lou Reed really gets crazy with his guitar on I Heard Her Call My Name, creating feedback squeals that make you want to cover your ears. And it really is the second side of this album that makes it what it is; sure, the first side has some good songs, but the roar of the second side really embodies this album's purpose, which I believe was to make an album in 1968 that sounded like something no one had ever imagined. There were other people doing proto-punk, like the Electric Prunes before them, but for sheer loudness and fury, no one could top this album. It sounded like garage rock, but completely stripped down to pure noise. <br /> <br />Without Andy Warhol or Nico, they were really able to be free and record whatever they wanted. I mean, Sister Ray is 17 minutes long, and if you're into that sort of thing, you'll have a fun time listening to it. Otherwise, you'll get bored quickly. I personally think that it varies enough to keep someone interested. There are virtually no chord changes for seventeen minutes straight, and it mainly becomes a battle between guitar and a freaked out distorted organ. I think I read somewhere that the engineer walked out of the studio during the recording of that song, simply saying, \\"Call me when you're done.\\" <br /> <br />You could play this song for a 16 year old like me and they would never believe that it came from 1967. It just doesn't sound like the sixties today. The funny thing is that it didn't sound like the sixties in the sixties! <br /> <br />I recommend this album, but be warned: this is as abrasive and difficult as 1967 ever got. <br /> <br />alex
B000HEWEE4|3.0|Like most people, \\"Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey\\" left me wanting more.  While we're left wondering what happed to Bill at the end of this most bogus journey, we've been given a glimpse into the life of Ted, all grown up, in 2006's \\"The Lake House.\\"  In case you're not up-to-date on movie time travel science, or worse yet -- you're not able to suspend all belief without even the slightest explanation, you should first watch:<br /><br />&lt;ul><br /><br />- \\"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\\" - remember when Present Day Bill & Ted meet *future* Bill & Ted?  The same principle applies to \\"The Lake House.\\"  Only this time, Present Day Ted meets Future Sandra Bullock (it's not explained well in this movie because it's assumed you've seen the first film in the series).<br /><br />- \\"Star Trek\\" - Several episodes may help, but \\"Generations\\" deals with the space-time continuum and might give you a good foundation in how time travel's possible in movie-science.<br /><br />- \\"Back to the Future\\" - This will help to illustrate how the actions taken in the past can impact life in the future (present). Without this background you're likely to ask totally irrational questions like \\"if he planted the tree in 2004, why didn't it show up until 2006???\\"  Trust me, don't do that to yourself.  Watch \\"Back to the Future\\" until you're okay with (or at least *resigned to*) the concept.<br /><br />&lt;/ul><br /><br />If, after watching these movies you still don't get \\"The Lake House,\\" perhaps you should invite Keanu Reeves to speak to the \\"most excellent science behind the movie\\" at your local university or Circle-K.  I'm certain Professor Reeves can sum up the science in easy to understand terms.<br /><br />Don't bother asking your postal carrier about the time-travel mailboxes.  The government claims these are \\"fictional,\\" but my search ensues.<br /><br />On an unrelated note, I gave \\"The Lake House\\" 3 of 5 stars for sheer comic value.  Thank you Keanu and Sandra for an hour and a half I'll never get back and for a life time of memories.I'll never get back and for a life time of memories.
B00004IC9G|5.0|manowar debut,1982 no one sounded like this,manowar embraced and took metal to a whole new level-they were young and cocky and supremely talented,they were metal and proud of it, musicianship wise they were untouchable-lyric wise they were original and now often imitated,at that time no one sang about metal and fantasy ,you could sense the beleif and confidence they had in themselves,manowar has always been original and you can hear a lot of things that no one else was doing at the time in battle hymns,this is the recording that started it all, over the top guitar soloing,vocals and screaming that made you standup and listen with disbeleif,a bass sound that was truly original and heavy,you could actually hear every bass note in this recording,the weak link musicianship wise was probably the drumming a little generic in comparison to the caliber of the other musicians,ive neve heard a better narraration in music than orson welles part in dark avenger just one of the many original things about manowar,another original thing was the bass solo and the subject matters of the songs,so buy this cd and hear how it all started and see why manowar has one of the most loyal fanbases ever,and why they are still around 25 years later,always believe.

The plot was reasonable and had the similarities to classics others have pointed out. <br /> <br />The PG-13 was really pushing it.  With the exception of full nudity, it had all the elements of an R.  I only mention this if you were going to watch it w/ your kids.  I've been into bars that had shadow-box dancers and this was similar.   <br /> <br />I almost gave it one star, but there were a few good scenes.
0783219695|5.0|The movie is remarkable at communicating these ideas and emotions:  The intent was not to send a man to the moon;  rather, it was to send mankind to the moon.  It was to go where no man had gone before.  It was to put priority and real action into a charactericstic that defines humanity:  curiosity.  And when most of mankind stopped caring about the adventurers we put at risk to pursue those goals, there were a few people who cared enough to never stop trying to find new and adaptive ways to get those adventurers out of harm's way.
0618680004|1.0|From his treatment of the question in The God Delusion it is apparent that the delusion from which Richard Dawkins suffers is that he understands Western Philosophy. His sarcastic question,\\"But Mommy who made God\\" was answered by Aristotle 2400 years ago in his \\"Metaphysics\\".  According to Aristotle God is the uncaused cause, the unmoved mover.  Thomas Aquinas followed this up in the 13th century by stating that God is that being whose essence is to exist. The point being that a contingent universe such as ours must be rooted in a Being which exists of necessity  .  This is not a trivial argument. But Dawkins treats it as if it were. He opposes it with formally invalid reasoning and trivial counter examples.  He doesn't even understand the ontological argument and apparently is unaware that there is a modern version of it of considerable interest.  When he's not shooting at sitting ducks like religious fundamentalists and Islamic fanatics he's taking snide sophmoric pot shots at more distinguished colleagues such as the late Stephen Jay Gould.  (Get over it Dawkins, the man is dead.)  <br />   Don't read this book. If you are a sincere atheist and want to read a serious atheist philosopher try Mackie \\"The Miracle of Theism\\".  Dawkins is either a fool or a con man.  He's a fool if he believes the drivel he writes or else he's just trying to make a quick buck off of a gullible public.
0618680004|4.0|Richard Dawkins is an exciting, bold, often brilliant writer. The good that this book will endenger will be considerable - debate, discussion, dissension. It is a very emotional - yet dispassionate in one sense - sharp, pungent, and thoroughly engaging read. It will force people to examine further the eternal debate of reality (perceived or factual) versus faith (perceived or factual). Faith in God is an emotional human reaction; but so is atheism. Dawkins'emotional ugliness toward faith is rapt, stimulating: this was his intended purpose, and he succeeds magnificently.<br /><br />Dawkins' response as an athiest to religions is pretty much on the same level as the Believers: emotional, passionate - but on far firmer ground. The obvious is stated (most eloquently): religions have caused much harm and misunderstanding, because, like human nature, everything is interpreted in a variety of ways. And carried out with such blatant inconsistency, you could make a strong case that religion has caused more confusion than has provided answers. One religion says one thing, another, something else. All these clashing beliefs has caused, in a phrase, \\"one fine mess.\\" An obvious fact.<br /><br />Like a lot of religions, though, this book will cause a great deal of reactions: comfort and reassurance, as well as, conversely, dread and fear. Comfort and further reassurance to athiests who no longer have to think twice about any belief system: they are permanently freed. Nothing to fear except fear itself, and, aided by the beauty of science, unencumbered by wishful thinking. Some would say that's a blissful state. The dread and fear factor will be from those who do Believe. Fear that Dawkins may somehow, be right; there is always that last lingering doubt that, what if, there IS no intervening God - that this is all there is - NOTHING ELSE. No miracle, no hereafter - no Larger Force to save Us,  and promising us Everlasting Life. And unfortunately for these individuals, they cannot use anything but faith to back up their arguments to the contrary of what appears to be Dawkins' firm scientific ground. It is hard to ignore science: there is too much seeming hardcore \\"evidence.\\" As science gets more sophisticated, it is difficult, one might say, impossible, to counter it by pure faith; the emotional reactions of a human brain cannot take the place of established research, mathematics and physics.<br /><br />And yet, I remain a hardcore agnostic. My thinking goes beyond feelings or emotions - only to what \\"is.\\" Faith and atheism are both emotional convictions, however you get down to it. Convictions do not take the place of facts - in any sense. Even if you had no scientific intellect or any kind of comprehension, literacy or emotional system of belief caused by an evolutionary mode of thought or by a reaction to the world around you, nothing can erase the factual state of what is present.<br /><br />Though I too, remain curious and fascinated by the roots and complexities of religious thought and fervor, I cannot be religious, because the interpretations of God by man are too fallibly inconsistent and emotional; it stems from fear, and of a punishment and reward system of thought. There I agree with Dawkins. I do not like to be preached interpretations of God by a stupid mortal. No mortal knows more than the other, and to assume otherwise is pretty crass and presumptuous. Religion in a way trivializes God, because it dummies down to an emotionallly simplistic mindset the mind-boggling complexities of all that is.<br /><br />I remain, conversely, thoroughly stimulated by the miracles of science, its goodness, its logic and its aims toward providing answers, solutions, understanding. All of it fostered and brought about by the human brain.<br /><br />And this is the eternal mystery - the human brain. Gray matter which can comprehend, be enriched - and that unmeasurable, but easily manipulated commodity - consciousness. Of course it evolved, but from what? A human reaction can consider this a \\"miracle.\\" Science has another term, perhaps, but there remains the question of All This's beginnings. Evolution is a tired fact. Easily provable, except for its alleged beginnings. Evolution, a provable fact back down to the actual seeds. But what about before the seeds? Who or what brought them to the fore? The life-force behind it? Earth's atmosphere and conditions notwithstanding, the fact is, elements exist, whether they're perceived as some haphazard accident or not.<br /><br />What happened before the \\"Big Bang\\"? The events before the forces that gathered to \\"cause\\" it? What was there before the \\"beginning?\\" The beginning before the beginning? Where did all the millions of species and plants come from? Did they magically just appear? These are fallible questions, but logically based; you don't have to think that nature is beautiful or ugly or meaningless - it's irrelevant to suppose that creationism, intelligent design, or, if you will, \\"God\\" is \\"behind\\" All This. Terms to create standards of measurement are human-intellect-fostered, whether established by religion or science, and are fallible modes of thought. What is a fact is that what is present, IS present. What other over-ballyhooed term other than \\"miracle\\" could be used to describe this present? Whether it was an accident, a plan, a waste, a nightmare, an aberration, a sick joke, a systematic order - the Here is Here. You don't have to have faith or logic to comprehend that; the %100 percent arrived-at how and why is the unfathomable mystery, the comprehension of which defies (and always will) complete understanding. A scientist knows no more than an illiterate, mute dummy.<br /><br />That is what defines my agnosticism: I can't be an athiest because I don't know for certain that there is Nothing, and I can't be religious in the faith sense because I don't know for certain, and have never seen proof of an actual intervenionist God. Only one thing puts me in that fallibly human \\"spiritual\\" department: the presence of all things here. It doesn't matter to me why or how: it is here. To my fallible human mind, probably as stupid as can be, the Here is the non-mysterious mystery: a miracle (and the fruits of that miracle have been abused by human actions - and yes - religion). Nature cannot be thought of as either beautiful or ugly because it has no emotion - it simply is. Joy or pain brought about by nature is an infinitesimal reaction. Emotion in itself won't matter in the long run because it will have no effect of what will happen, regardless. Human emotion may destroy or nurture the Earth in the interim, but the Earth will do what it will, and the here will happen as it will. All arguments and suppositions are worthless, because they change nothing.<br /><br />Dawkins' book, however filled with fact, brilliance, logic and reasoning, is still, only the views of one man, and consequently, ultimately, one of faith in what he believes in. Though it is plainly that of vigorous conviction of a science-based, non-belief system, it is, in the larger scheme of things, devoid of reality, because, like religion in itself, cannot ultimately provide the completed picture.<br /><br />Only God knows.e it evolved, but from what? A human reaction can consider this a \\"miracle.\\" Science has another term, perhaps, but there remains the question of All This's beginnings. Evolution is a tired fact. Easily provable, except for its alleged beginnings. Evolution, a provable fact back down to the actual seeds. But what about before the seeds? Who or what brought them to the fore?

You don't have to have faith or logic to comprehend that; the %100 percent arrived-at how and why is the unfathomable mystery, the comprehension of which defies (and always will) complete understanding. A scientist knows no more than an illiterate, mute dummy. <br /> <br />That is what defines my agnosticism: I can't be an athiest because I don't know for certain that there is Nothing, and I can't be religious in the faith sense because I don't know for certain, and have never seen proof of an actual intervenionist God. Only one thing puts me in that fallibly human \\"spiritual\\" department: the presence of all things here. It doesn't matter to me why or how: it is here. To my fallible human mind, probably as stupid as can be, the Here is the non-mysterious mystery: a miracle (and the fruits of that miracle have been abused by human actions - and yes - religion). Nature cannot be thought of as either beautiful or ugly because it has no emotion - it simply is. Joy or pain brought about by nature is an infinitesimal reaction. Emotion in itself won't matter in the long run because it will have no effect of what will happen, regardless. Human emotion may destroy or nurture the Earth in the interim, but the Earth will do what it will, and the here will happen as it will. All arguments and suppositions are worthless, because they change nothing.     <br /> <br />Dawkins' book, however filled with fact, brilliance, logic and reasoning, is still, only the views of one man, and consequently, ultimately, one of faith in what he believes in. Though it is plainly that of vigorous conviction of a science-based, non-belief system, it is, in the larger scheme of things, devoid of reality, because, like religion in itself, cannot ultimately provide the completed picture. <br /> <br />Only God knows.
B0000VD04M|5.0|good acting, good cinematography,funny lines but darnit if Ed Wood didn't make some CLUNKERS in his time.one right after the other. <br /> <br />with that said, this movie's a keeper. :)
B000F0UUT6|4.0|However...I read a review that neither Colin Firth nor Jennifer Ehle is a featured cast member in the retrospective documentary.  The other actors were very good but it's strange that in the 10 anniversary edition we don't get to hear from at least one of the two leads.  Does anyone know why??
B0002858YS|5.0|Since I've had this album for a long time but really haven't listened to it lately, I decided to give it another listen after listening to Sam's Town and maybe it's simply because of my familiarity with it, but it was like a breath of fresh air. <br /> <br />Let me first say this album isn't perfect.  Lyrically it's not phenominal but for the music and vocal style, it just works.  A few songs can turn into a drag because it isn't too diverse in its instrumental technique and Flowers' vocal range is certainly limited.  But somehow it all comes together nicely for a melodic, energetic and upbeat album. <br /> <br />First off, the melodies and choruses on this album far surpass Sam's Town.  One thing I notice about the new album is how the choruses linger on and don't really peak at any point.  Almost every song on Hot Fuss has a strong chorus and despite the massive layers that sometimes bog down the sound, songs such as All The Things That I've Done, Mr. Brightside, Smile Like You Mean It, and Change Your Mind overcome that and leave you with a much more exciting and enjoyable music experience. <br /> <br />What some people may say is that the first album is more accessible and the new album shows growth and maturation because it doesn't catch on as quickly as the first.  I disagree entirely.  To me, it simply sounds like a confused and overworked group have patched together an album to satisfy their recording contract.  Everyone talks about the influences of the new album, and yes I can hear it, but all bands have influences.  But to become a legitimate band, you have to become an influence yourself and they are far from influencing anyone after their latest album. <br /> <br />I'm disappointed because Hot Fuss is a strong effort by a band that really showed promise and cohesiveness, but it seems lost on the new album.  This may not exactly be a five-star record but I feel much happier listening to this album than Sam's Town.
B000H305U0|4.0|There are a bunch of people who are still bitter over the way Justin Timberlake handled himself with the whole Janet Jackson/Superbowl fallout.  But to discount him as a singer because of it would be unfair and unjust.  So going forward, this review is in no way a reflection of that incident or his involvement in the boy band N Sync.  I think everybody should be considerate of artists who break the mold of what is 'expected' of them.  With that said, Future Sex/Love Sounds is one of the best 'pop' albums to date.  I classify it as pop because most of the songs on this project border more on dance and electronic than the R&B genre.  Nevertheless, that still doesn't mean that Future Sex/Love Sounds is not enjoyable.  It's arguably one of the best albums of the year.<br /><br />The groove that he has throughout the album is unmistakable and quite obvious.  A lot of people would then turn around and say that every song 'sounds' the same on the album.  Not so.  The title track starts off the album with a futuristic sound more common in electronic music, but still has a underlying beat to keep it funky.  \\"SexyBack\\" is the monster single that is commanding all radio formats and being overplayed like any other number one track in recent memory.  \\"Sexy Ladies\\" is a throwback to the early 80s sound with groups like The Time or Prince's funkier music.  \\"My Love\\" featuring the rising rap superstar T.I. is my pick for a second single because of purely addictive music composition.  \\"LoveStoned\\" is barely passable because of the beat, but the singing could've been a tad better.  \\"What Goes Around\\" is a mellow, mid-tempo that suffers the same fate with a stellar background but the lyrics and delivery aren't there.<br /><br />Justin dives face first into the urban stratosphere with Timbaland and Three Six Mafia for \\"Chop Me Up.\\"  This is followed by the drum heavy groove \\"Damn Girl\\" featuring Will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas.  \\"Summer Love\\" is a thumper for your ride just like the songs suggests in the opening lyrics.  \\"Until The End Of Time\\" will remind you of Prince from its synthesized breaks, but the mellow riff and the inclusion of an orchestra makes it a Justin Timberlake original.  \\"Losing My Way\\" is a tale about letting drugs take over your life, while \\"All Over Again\\" is a smooth, piano-laced cut where Justin taps into his soul and pours his heart out for another chance with a girl (Cameron Diaz, maybe?)  The album then closes with a pointless bonus cut featuring Snoop Dogg called \\"Pose\\" that could have easily been left off the cd.<br /><br />Having sold platinum in under a month, Future Sex/Love Sounds is proof that Justin Timberlake has the staying power to have a prosperous solo career.  He will probably continue to be shuffled between R&B and Pop, but one thing that is for sure is that he knows how to make hits.  And with the dynamic duo of Timberland and Timberlake, the future looks promising to say the least.the songs suggests in the opening lyrics.  \\"Until The End Of Time\\" will remind you of Prince from its synthesized breaks, but the mellow riff and the inclusion of an orchestra makes it a Justin Timberlake original.  \\"Losing My Way\\" is a tale about letting drugs take over your life, while \\"All Over Again\\" is a smooth, piano-laced cut where Justin taps into his soul and pours his heart out for another chance with a girl (Cameron Diaz, maybe?)

B000002P86|4.0|While not the greatest blues album of all time or even the best from B.B. King, this is still a very good blues album that is a lot of fun to listen to. Album is worth the price of admission just for 'The Thrill is Gone' with Tracy Chapman.  My favorite version of that song not to mention great cuts with Van Morrison, who in his own right is a great blues sing, Eric Clapton, and more.  Just sample the first three cuts and you will be hooked.  Sure there are a couple of sinkers on the album, like BB trying to do a Hip Hop song, which makes me a little sick to my stomach right before a I hit the forward button.  The gems far our weigh the sinkers (which are few) and if you don't take the album so seriously you may end up really enjoying yourself.  If you like BB King or just want to get more into the blues this is a great place to start.  Also, BB's album with Eric Clapton - Riding with the King - is also very good.
0060776757|5.0|I think other reviewers are getting bogged down in the process of how the book was created or how cool the photos are. The best part of this book is the words of the four band members themselves. They are candid, open, and honest, and do not pull any punches. I never knew about the deaths of Bono's and Larry's mothers, and the way this unfolds was special. Or how loyal they have been to each other (and to their wide circle of friends). The background in their school days in Dublin was what showed me why they stayed together for thirty years, and why they rely on each other. Yes, the photos are amazing. But it is the stories the band tells themselves which is what makes it precious. This is a coffee table book like no other by a band like no other. I highly recommend you give this book to any U2 fans you know (I bought 3 copies already!).
B0009V1GBW|5.0|This is Eric and Rock and Roll at its finest.  You could easily say this is also one of the finest blues albums ever made.  While the music, which is fanastic, is rock, the singing comes from the soul.  This album finds Eric teaming up with a cast of all stars including Duane Allman.  This is a tortured time in E.C.'s life fighting substance abuse and in the guilt associated with loving his best friend's (George Harrison) wife. This is a great blues album that should be part of everyone list.  Also check out the new re-issue of this album that includes some of the extended jam sessions.
B000ETQRCM|3.0|I'm always amazed by the bad reviews of yield.  Yield is a great album but not for head bangers.  This new album is for HB's - which is probably why it receives such praise.  Yield, Riot Act and Live at the Garden are the best.
B000002MTU|4.0|It's taken me a while to come around on this album. At first I think I had my expectation set a little highly - Eric Clapton doing a all blues album can do that do you.  This album is very good, but not for reasons you might think.  For one Eric's vocals shine better then his guitar playing.  The blues is as much an emotion as it is a music style and Eric has seen his share of the blues in his life and that comes across in his singing.  Another factor is that this album is not over produced like some of his recent efforts.  A live to tape format is used, whihc gives the album more of a gritty blues blue.  Finally I like the tasteful use of horns on this album.  On a down ot Eric's guitar playing sounds a little forced. Slow hand is trying to copy some styles that make it sound like Eric playing someone else vs. Eric just playing if that makes sense. Overall a very good blues album.  Looking for another great blues album by E.C. try Derek and teh Domino's Associated Love Songs.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This Is One of my favorite cds ever. A lot of people seem to critize them because they have stage names and so on.  AX7 first two albums were good but nothing compared to this. The gutiar work on this album is amazing. Its good to see that there is a band out there that has finally brought back sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Even outside of that these guys have an extreme amount of talent. The songs on city of evil are ranging from 5 min to 9 min which i think is great. One of the most impresseve things about this album is how much the songs change. Sidewinder for example has a lot of unexpected twists and turns which makes it one of the best songs on here. Other great songs are The Beast and the Harlot, MIA, Sieze the day, and Thrashed and Scatterd.

B000EHRVP6|1.0|If you read my review title, you probably guessed that I disliked this film with immense passion. And yes, you would be correct. I cannot even begin to set up this review without dispelling how much this movie made me angry to have wasted 100 minutes or so of my life to watch it.<br /><br />Cinematically, this was my introduction to Eli Roth. I have read mixed results on his contributions to film thus far. Critics; naturally, consider him another run-of-the-mill schlock artist. Actual horror fans seem to be evenly split between thinking he's overrated and finding his work to be that of genius. After seeing \\"Hostel\\", I was in my own category of thinking he should just stop.<br /><br />From the outset, the three college students we are following around equate to being the three most idiotic horror movie victims I can remember in quite a while. Personally, I wanted to see all three of them mangled instantly. The basic idea revolves around their backpacking trip of Europe in search of babes and booze. While headed to a brothel where the most beautiful girls will pleasure any American at the drop of a hat, they run afoul a gentleman who ends up being not as he seems.<br /><br />From their first encounter with him, it turns into a tale where each one gets sold up the river to a rich man's hunting club where wealthy men with sick and macabre fascinations pay good money to torture and kill helpless victims. However, by the time the mayhem really begins, you've spent too much time yawning and rolling your eyes at the pre-junior high school dialogue to even care.<br /><br />So, all one really has left to savor is the gore, which in total is nothing you haven't seen in recent years from other directors who choose not to walk the safe path of PG-13 horror. Sure, there are some cringe-worthy moments here and there but again, someone with a penchant for horror films will likely walk away unimpressed. There are a few nods to Fulci and Argento here and there but overall, nothing you could categorize as being as inventive or original. The most annoying part was the set-up for how Jay Hernandez eventually escapes. I won't ruin it for you if you plan to see this movie but I can assure you, it could not possibly get any lamer.<br /><br />So yeah, I hated this movie from start to finish. Since then, I've seen \\"Cabin Fever\\" and found it to be much more enjoyable. Eli Roth has the capabilities to make a decent film, albeit his dialogue writing abilities need some serious work, even for schlock.thing you could categorize as being as inventive or original.

0618680004|5.0|Dawkins succeeds in debunking the myths of religious belief in an organized, thorough fashion. However, the real benefit of this book is revealing the true level of destruction and evil that is inflicted upon the world in the name of religion. Among those listed are intolerance, misogyny, child abuse, suppression of knowledge, and--of course--terrorism and wars. Every American should read this: the information in this book is central to fully understanding our country's culture today--and its course for tomorrow.

051788710X|5.0|I recently attended a workshop by Robert Moss, and have to say I was highly impressed. In fact before I attended, I had a dream which was later reenacted with the other people in the workshop playing characters in the dream.<br /><br />We did some dream exercises and journeys during which I had some of my most enjoyable experiences and insights. He also mentioned this book is probably his most important work.  One of the insights was a dream flight where we flew out over San Francisco Bay.  If you can imagine a Pelican flying, and then lying in the water, and using its wings to swim, and saying 'Get out of your element, to get into your element,' you can probably appreciate one of the reasons I enjoyed it so much, so I have bought the book, to develop some of his concepts further.
B000DN6ZGC|5.0|like other reviewers have said, it's easy to listen from front to back. and I do so several times a day, like everyday since I got it. I first learned of corinne on BETj late spring. \\"Put your records on\\" is what they played most and now more so \\"Like a star\\". Both songs are great and great for an introduction of her to mainstream.  <br /> <br />I love all of her lyrics, her voice, and just her. Her SNL performance had a sister in tears. I think many more people picked up on her with this performance and I'm glad she did it.  <br /> <br />First listens of course should be the aforementioned cuts but also check out \\"enchantment\\" \\"butterfly\\" and \\"seasons change\\" This is something you can listen to in the car with your kids or even grandma. NO raunchy and crappy lyrics here.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|In the midst of Widower (Mortician?) (Colin Firth), Cedric Brown's troubles comes a frightful looking witch-of-a-nanny, hairy warts and all. With her stern-looking unibrow and bucktooth, she transforms the lives of seven children with one thump of her craggy looking cane. If childrearing were this easy, us mothers would all purchase a similar walking stick! (I noticed Emma had a similar one when she appeared at the premiere). Can I please borrow it, Ms. Thompson?<br /><br /> My daughter and I were kept in stitches with all of the silly antics and we truly enjoyed this entertaining family movie written by the dame herself, Emma Thompson. It was loosely based on Christianna Brand's Nurse Matilda books, and who better to play the plum role of Nanny McPhee, than Ms. Thompson? One thing though, did disappoint me. Nanny McPhee was so good with the children and so pretty at the end--that my daughter and I wondered why Mr. Brown couldn't have married her?<br /><br />Angela Lansbury was wonderfully quirky as the hoity toity Aunt Adelaide who held the purse strings and coerced Mr. Brown into taking a bride. It was hilarious how, while he was wooing the opportunist Mrs. Quickly (Celia Imrie), his rambunctious little imps did their best to sabotage things. Colin Firth as Mr. Brown was dynamic. So was the scullery maid Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald). And, in the end, everything comes together like some magnificent fairy tale, snow in August, and all. Kirk Jones, directed.  Beware of dark undertones if you're wary of witchcraft. This review refers to the DVD.

B000GG4Y32|5.0|A DVD release of this film has been a long time coming with the studio waiting for Warren Beatty's involvement. He had been long resistant to doing DVD extras for his movies but seems to have changed his mind for this title perhaps because it was such a personal project. There are seven featurettes that can be viewed separately or altogether. For fans, there are brand new interviews with many of the major players: Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Paul Sorvino, cinematographer Vittorio Storaro and others.<br /><br />\\"Witness to Reds: The Rising\\" traces the origins of the film. Beatty was interested in making a film about the development of the American left from 1915 to 1920 and, in particular, John Reed and his incredible, albeit brief life.<br /><br />\\"Witness to Reds: Comrades\\" features Beatty talking about he cast the movie. Beatty convinced Jack Nicholson to play O'Neill by saying that he was the only actor who could take Diane Keaton away from him in a movie.<br /><br />\\"Witness to Reds: Testimonials\\" examines the testimonial segments in the film with people who actually knew the historical figures depicted in the movie. It was an interesting conceit that gave Reds a quasi-documentary feel and provided exposition that Beatty wouldn't have to dramatize.<br /><br />\\"Witness to Reds: The March\\" examines the pre-production phase. Beatty almost got the chance to shoot in Russia but made a political faux pas and so he had to shoot elsewhere.<br /><br />\\"Witness to Reds: The Revolution - Part 1\\" takes a look at the politics of the film. Fellow cast members talk about how Beatty's personal philosophy is mirrored in the movie.<br /><br />\\"Witness to Reds: The Revolution - Part 2\\" examines Beatty's fascination with Reed's internal conflict between arts and politics.

As the executives who I place can tell you, every new job situation is different and canned formulas don't always work.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I 'discovered' older radiohead last week on a recommendation from a friend.   <br />As with any art form, it's impossible to quantify the global significance of any music -- only its significance to YOU.  Therefore, great music is music that moves YOU. <br />I'm drawn to music that manipulates my emotions, and I routinely listen to music to purposely change or intensify the mood I'm in.  It's a great tool that way. <br />Right now I'm listening to 'Exit music (for a film)' -- for about the 40th time in 3 days.  This song starts soft & dark & sweet, slowly building to a gut-wrenching climax, then recedes easily into a comfortable melancholy.  The anticipation that grows from this gradual crescendo, and the ensuing climax, is exquisite.   <br />Once it kicks, the baseline in this song is staggering.  I've never heard a baseline that moved me as much.   <br />Then -- with \\"sing us a song, a song to keep us warm\\" -- the slithering, eely netherworldly voices of the shadows join in for hellish support. <br />Thom Yorke's voice is just what the song needs -- feathery soft & controlled, then spooky strong.   <br />You should know that darker music is not what I usually listen to.  Radiohead definitely describes a more sinister & morose side of our daily lives.  That said, I find this album in no way depressing. <br />It seems a natural complement to everyday life.  Good music makes me feel like others have felt my feelings, and that is feeling is reassuring.  It connects me to the people who have felt as I've felt. <br />There's no yardstick to measure art.  What you feel about it is what it is. <br />I hope you enjoy this album as much as I have, <br />-Dan <br /> <br />
B000FL7CAK|5.0|****SPOILERS ALERT*****<br /><br />So, here's VERONICA MARS - THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON, which ushers in our favorite teen sleuth's high school senior year. And some things have changed for the Mars family. It's been three months since the events of Season One's eventful final episode. Keith Mars, Veronica's dad, is still a private eye, but, now, he's written a New York Times bestseller (95th on the list) regarding the Lilly Kane Murder, and he's also running for Sheriff. He's hired by a prominent pro baseball player who fears he may be implicated in a serious crime. He also becomes buddies with the Neptune mayor, who, like all politicians, begin asking for favors. But never mind that. Suffice it to say, Keith Mars remains the coolest, most understanding dad ever on TV. Veronica, our wry and prickly 18-year-old heroine, seems to be a bit more content nowadays. She's survived and moved on from last year's ostracism, though she still navigates the vicious morass of teenage social politics, often finds herself embroiled in the class wars between the haves and the have-nots, and, of course, suffers thru that old reliable youthful malady: teen angst. But, now, she's got a normal gig waitressing at a restaurant and even finds time to have a romantic life every now and then. And, being Veronica Mars, she still solves cases. As usual, she is aided and abetted by her best friend Wallace (who goes thru his own set of rough times here) and Mac, the nerdy computer hack.<br /><br />And just because Lilly Kane's murder has been solved, and the murderer imprisoned, that doesn't mean that there isn't a season-long mystery to mull over. In fact, we are treated to two season-long mysteries, as well as further ramifications of the slaying of Lilly Kane. The first big mystery involves a school bus which careens over a cliff and kills everyone on board, most of whom were Neptune High students. Veronica is compelled to get to the bottom of this case; she had an ex-friend on that bus, and also suspects that she herself was the one targeted by the saboteur (she was supposed to be on that bus). The second mystery, which actually begins in Season One's final episode, revolves around who killed Felix, a cousin and crony member of Weevil Navarro's PCH bike gang. Throughout the season, we also witness Ms. Mars take on cases involving student athletes flunking their drug tests, pizza boy muggings, gay website blackmailing, tracking down the identity of an abused child, Wallace being framed for a hit and run, the theft of a school cash box, a missing bride-to-be, a disgruntled custodian, etc. My favorite mystery of the day may have been when Veronica goes to jury duty and enacts her own version of 12 ANGRY MEN. Add to all that the trial of Aaron Echols, which requires the testimonies of the Mars family, and you could see how full Veronica's plate is this season.<br /><br />The cast is great, as ever. The regulars' acting performances maintain the high standards set with last season's debut. This show has been compared to BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, DAWSON'S CREEK, and even HEATHERS in terms of its portrayal of teenage sensibilities, its showcasing of wit and charm, and the relevance of its topical issues. Charisma Carpenter (the slutty but muy caliente Kendall Casablancas) comes on board semi-regularly to further bolster the Buffy connection. Alyson Hannigan shows up now and then as Logan Echoll's flighty sister, and even Joss Whedon does a cameo. More new blood surfacing are Steve Guttenberg (Woody Goodman) and Tessa Thompson (Jackie Cook), while Kevin Smith and Lucy Lawless show up for one episode each. But the standouts continue to be Enrico Colantoni (Keith Mars), Jason Dohring (Logan Echolls), and, of course, Kristen Bell as Veronica. The relationship between Veronica and her dad (which is tested this season) continue to produce emotionally rich and satisfactory moments on television. Jason Dohring? Well, he's got that tortured, bad boy image down and he's really good with the caustic remarks, as he steadily turns biting sarcasm into an elevated artform.<br /><br />So, as you may have guessed, Season 2, like Season 1, is chock full of humorous one-liners and witty observations delivered with inspired dryness. I don't know if high school kids are actually this off-the-cuff funny and erudite, but I'll take it. The best line, for me, though, came from an adult, Keith Mars, who, upon photographing a potential troublemaker, warns him: \\"The next time I shoot you, it won't be digitally. Unless I hit you in the finger; then, we'll have a laugh about it.\\"<br /><br />Not much to speak of with regards to special features. There are additional scenes, a gag reel, and 2 featurettes: \\"A Day on the Set with Veronica Mars\\" (Kristen Bell breaks down a typical shooting day) and \\"Veronica Mars: Not Your Average Teen Detective.\\" The dvd package also comes with a booklet with episode guides.<br /><br />VERONICA MARS remains one of the best - and certainly one of the most addictive - shows on television and is a top fixture on my must see list. Veronica Mars, thanks to Kristen Bell's scintillating performance, is well on her way to becoming an iconic, pop culture figure. This season has the trademark plot twists and misdirections and is guaranteed to keep the viewer guessing and coming back. The final episode of this season truly CANNOT be missed.

There, don't say I didn't give you a heads up.
B0000028WD|5.0|This is a fantastic tribute concert! The hightlights for me are:<br /><br />Tom Thumb's Blues and All Along the Watchtower by Neil Young - he really nailed these songs!<br /><br />Chrissie Hynde does a great job on I Shall Be Released<br /><br />Clapton's Don't Think Twice is absolutely amazing! I am NOT a big Clapton fan but he is back to his old self here, doing blues rock, and his playing - and SINGING - are better than I've ever heard him, live.<br /><br />Tom Petty excels on License To Kill.<br /><br />McGuinn's Mr. Tambourine Man shows you why the Byrds took flight for a long, beautiful journey back in 1965 or so.<br /><br />Then you have Richie Havens on Just Like A Woman<br /><br />And of course Dylan's own Girl From the North Country.<br /><br />George Harrison's Absolutely Sweet Marie, I thought was a poor selection for him to do, but it's still great to hear him. He fares better in his part of My Back Pages featuring Dylan, McGuinn, Petty, Young and Clapton as well, which may be the highlight of the disc.<br /><br />There are a few other good songs, and those plus the above make it worth owning this disc!<br /><br />Everyone has their own taste, but for me, the other artists not mentioned here did not fare so well, even though I do like some of them.<br /><br />What I did was take the above list of songs and put them on a cd-r, and it is a 100% fantastic single cd! You might want to choose your favorites and do the same. But get this set, it's amazing!

0446577383|1.0|David Baldacci is going to be rich, once he sues the 12-year-old who wrote this book using his name.  That's the only plausible explanation I can come up with as to how Baldacci could possibly have written such an awful novel.   <br /> <br />You think my explanation is silly?  You won't like this book then, because every single idea in it is worse than silly.  The plot is a mess, the dialogue is attrocious, the characters are tired and cliche, and the worst part is that the author is capable of so much more. <br /> <br />Don't waste your time on this one - you'll never get those hours back.
0618680004|5.0|Like it or not, \\"The God Delusion\\" by Richard Dawkins is an impressive argument against the anthropomorphic God of monotheism. And sparks fly as Dawkins rails against his adversary, accusing Him of numerous crimes against humanity as well as being \\"psychotic.\\"  There are times when reading this book is like the Scopes Monkey Trial revisited. Dawkins, the grim Barrister, takes aim at Intelligent Design and a host of related issues, and bewilders the jury with an avalanche of hard evidence to bolster his case. Milton's Satan has nothing on this guy. Dawkins is like a fascinating literary character that's out to slay the Ancient of Days!     This is where British empiricism, admirable though it may be, appears to be following in the footsteps of David Hume (1711-1776). Hume seemed delighted at the prospect of parceling up all our books on divinity and metaphysics and consigning them to the flames because, as he said, they contained \\"nothing but sophistry and illusion.\\" So British empiricism has had a long tradition of being at war with divinity. And its rigid logic and inadmissibility of spurious evidence has contributed to a staggering number of scientific advances. This is an indisputable historical fact.      Therefore, \\"The God Delusion\\" is an ontological argument of cosmic proportions and it affects every particle (and wave) of our current existence.     No doubt Monotheism has given us many heroes and villains over the centuries, and it certainly has its problematical aspects. However, science is not free of sin either. I ask you: would we even have atomic weapons if it were not for science? And would we have ballistic missiles that can deliver them to specific targets? Of course not, and these are just a couple of the maladies that science has released from Pandora's Box. We have no idea what horrors will evolve out of genetic engineering, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and countless other projects of the Sorcerer's Apprentice. Indeed, we are more mesmerized by the threat of terrorism and religious fundamentalism than we are by Doctor Frankenstein, even though he may be the true terrorist of the future.     This is why some regard the rise of religious fundamentalism as a reaction to the modern technological world. Millions of people are suspicious of its \\"progress\\" and see demonic mischief in its ubiquitous inventions. So, in spite of all attempts to debunk \\"The God Delusion\\" I doubt if God is going to fade away any time soon because spiritual faith actually thrives on the hostility of its adversaries. Besides, the human quest for Splendor, Holiness, transcendence, and redemption seems to trump all reasoned arguments against it anyway.    But it is still good to have a lean and hungry argument against \\"The God Delusion\\" so that the Idea of the Holy can evolve into the fittest and most formidable specimen possible. If God is to exist at all, there can be no bounds to the Deity's sheer resilience.
1587880784|5.0|Clarke's classic novel should be familiar to everyone by now, so it warrants no real introduction and to review the story in detail would be a rehash of the many glowing reviews submitted here.  I would like to mention the quality of the unabridged audio recording of the 2000 reissue of 2001.<br /><br />The intruduction is read by Clarke himself.  In it, he describes working with Stanley Kubrick and tells the origins of the story and the relevence it has had on SF culture and our culture in general over the last 40 or so years.  I do find it interesting that Clarke, who explored so many worlds in fiction and fact, was terrified of driving a motor vehicle, just as Kubrick was afraid to fly.<br /><br />The narration is superb, and the story is brought to life in audio form in a way that deserves the attention of every reader.  Despite having read it on two occasions and having watched the movie several times, I was hooked on this version.  This is one you should check out, no matter how many times you've read the book or seen the movie.<br /><br />I should, however, add how much more I liked the ending of the book to that of the movie.  It made so much more sense when the place where David Bowman goes in the monolith is described and his mission afterwards is detailed.  This left me wanting to reread the other three books in the series as well as the two short stories from which it was based.
0140177396|4.0|\\"Of Mice and Men\\" was first published in 1937 and has been adapted for the stage and screen. It's set in mid-1930s California and opens beside the Salinas river, a few miles outside Soledad. The book focuses on Lennie and George, a pair of migrant workers who earn a living on the state's farms. George is the dominant character of the pair, as Lennie isn't quite capable of looking after himself properly. Although big and strong, he has a poor memory, panics easily and doesn't always understand what's happening around him. All he wants out of life is to have his own farm with George, look after some rabbits and \\"live of the fatta the lan'\\". As the book opens, the pair are on their way to a new job; they had to leave their previous job and go on the run after Lennie was (falsely) accused to rape. Things don't go smoothly for the pair when they arrive at their new place of work. It's clear that the farm owner's son, Curley, and his wife are going to be the source of a great deal of trouble.  <br /> <br />\\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a very short book - a great deal shorter and much easier than I'd expected. I had a great deal of sympathy for Lennie, who was based on a real person : in an ideal world, he shouldn't have been leading the life he was living. Similarly, I think George was placed in an impossible position at the end of the book - though I couldn't help but wonder how George himself saw things. As I was reading the book's climax, I couldn't help but think of something Candy had said to George earlier in the book, regarding his dog.  <br /> <br />I'd definitely recommend this book, particularly the Penguin Classics edition if you can get your hands on it. Susan Shillinglaw's introduction for this edition really set things in context for me. However, I wouldn't necessarily recommend reading the introduction first - it does contain a couple of spoilers.
B00000FC5H|5.0|What a super compilation of Earth, Wind, and Fire's great tunes.  Listening to this Cd reminded me of what  great tunes these dudes put out.  Shinin' Star was such a classic back in the day.  And man those funky horns on Getaway.  Sing A Song and the passionate Fantasy are also classic chestnuts.  However there are plenty of shoulda been classics like the groovin' Saturday Night and the cool ballad Reasons.<br /><br />What can I say?  There are some fast, others slow, those which groove, and others with jazzy touches.  But nearly everyone is a gem.
0316172324|3.0|I like the concept of the book which is basically telling you to trust your hunches, instincts and/or gut.  Good advice that is good to hear from time to time lest we forget.  That being said, the book gets boring after mentioning tale after tale of people trusting their instincts in certain situations.  You need only read the first half of the book (probably not even that) and you pretty much have all the info you need.<br /><br />Buy it used.  Read it.  Then give it away.  Good book - just a little redundant and boring towards the middle and the end.
B000002J29|5.0|This excellent live album (1977) was released following the A Trick of a Tail and Wind and Wuthering tours of 1976 and 1977 respectively and is a nice summary of their proggy material from the 1970s.  Steve Hackett also provided his last performance with Genesis and he would go on to a solo career full time following Seconds Out.  Unfortunately, there was a little bit of \\"revenge by mixing\\" and Steve has all been mixed out - his guitar parts are barely discernible.  In general, although I wished that more of the material from Wind and Wuthering made its way onto this album, this is still an excellent compilation.<br /><br />Augmenting the core of Steve Hackett (electric guitar and acoustic 12 string guitar); Tony Banks (Hammond organ, mellotron 400, RMI electric piano, ARP Pro Soloist, 12 string guitar); Mike Rutherford (bass guitar, Moog Taurus bass pedals; 8 string bass guitar; acoustic and electric 12 string guitars); and Phil Collins (lead vocals, drums), is former Weather Report drummer Chester Thompson.  Chester is an absolutely excellent drummer and he really lends a great deal of swing and oomph to classic Genesis pieces; especially on the 24 minute Supper's Ready.  I suspect that Phil was instrumental in getting Chester on board - especially in light of the fact that Phil liked drummers who could \\"get behind\\" pieces and Phil's involvement with and love for jazz rock fusion (Brand X).  Along with Chester, Bill Bruford plays on Cinema Show and does a fantastic job (he is Bill Bruford after all).<br /><br />This live album marks the beginning of the \\"medleys\\" that became staples on subsequent live Genesis albums.  As they appear on Seconds Out, this includes The lamb Lies down on Broadway and the closing section of The Musical Box, along with Dance on a Volcano/Los Endos.  The performance of Suppers Ready is what gets me excited though - it is played with such power and conviction that an already incredible piece of music is made that much better.  Last but not least is the fantastic Chester/Phil drum solo on Los Endos - great stuff all around.  Speaking of Phil, he does a great job on vocals, including the Peter Gabriel material.  He does not unnaturally extend his vocal range either; everything is well performed and very strong.<br /><br />With respect to sound quality, this live album is top shelf.  In fact I suspect that these recordings were taken directly from the mixing boards although I am not too sure about that.  Suffice it to say that the sound quality is excellent although Cinema Show does sound a bit thin in comparison to the other tracks.<br /><br />All in all this is a superb live Genesis album and would make a great addition to the Genesis collection.  Highly recommended along with the studio albums that are represented here: Nursery Cryme (1971); Foxtrot (1972); Selling England by the Pound (1973); The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974); A Trick of the Tail (1976); and Wind and Wuthering (1976).fantastic Chester/Phil drum solo on Los Endos - great stuff all around.

0679735909|5.0|This is romance in the classical tradition --- intelligent, witty, mysterious, and haunting. I first read the book five years ago and have re-read it several times since. It is a pure pleasure to read for the beauty of the prose alone. Add to that the delights of some very interesting characters and descriptive passages that remain haunting long after the book is finished and you have a novel worthy of being called a \\"romance\\".<br /><br />I have been discouraged in recent years by the romenace-genre which seems pithy and silly when compared to the great romantic traditions. Byatt includes a quote from Nathaniel Hawthorne in the beginning of her book about the nature of the romance and novel. I personally am grateful to writers of Ms. Byatt's talents who want to reclaim the romance novel to a work of such quality! Hawthorne (and Melville and Cooper) would be thrilled.
0671015206|5.0|The basic premise after all the wash is done, is that those who are what the authors refer to as 'Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth (PAWs)' have figured out the difference between what they want and what they need; that they aren't sucked into the consumerism machine that the marketing hypnotists attempt to impose upon us; and that they understand that there's more than one way to get the things that they need, which often involves innovation, barter, and yes.... a little effort.<br /><br />A great read, one you should share with your children at the earliest opportunity.

B00005JPBP|5.0|This is an interesting movie based around in london in 1900 when the age of magicians/magic show were taking of, of course culmonating with houdini in America.  A very interesting concept for the movie, and it really did keep me guessing.  I could write a long review like many of the other reviewers, but they do a good job at summerizing it. I can just say, Chritian Bale and Hugh Jackman do spectacular jobs at playing these roles and it was Cool Seeing David Bowie in a movie again, although I kept picturing him in that Darn Labarinth outfit as he played the role of Dr. Tesla. Well casted, great efects, and great plot. Check it out.
0618680004|4.0|Dawkins' new book adds his voice to the growing chorus warning against the dangers of popular yet obsolete religions. Daniel Dennett's latest \\"Breaking the Spell\\" analytically covers some of the same issues while Sam Harris' \\"Letter to a Christian Nation\\" is more succinct and cogent. Nonetheless Dawkins presents some interesting material that was new to me. I especially liked his arguments that subjecting children to religious indoctrination constitutes child abuse -- Dawkins' arguments differ from, but are supportive of MD Faber's in \\"The Psychological Roots of Religious Belief.\\" (See my reviews of these other books.)<br /><br />Yet I believe there are a couple of important issues that Dawkins, Dennett and Harris don't address. They don't seem to recognize that many folks, until they've found satisfactory replacements, won't let go of their worn-out old beliefs (won't `fly over the cuckoo's nest'). One issue has to do with meaning and purpose in our lives; the other with the sense of going beyond one's self, of the `mystical', that religions traditionally provide (see Midgley's review in \\"NewScientist\\" 7Oct'06,p50-1). Both of these issues are extensively covered in my book \\"Concepts: A ProtoTheist Quest for Science-Minded Skeptics.\\" Also I can't agree with Dawkins' assertion that the origin of life was not the result of evolutionary processes (p137-41). In my book I trace the emergence of ever increasing synergistic complexity in evolution's long trajectory. I've a few other quibbles but all-in-all Dawkins' book is a well worthwhile read.
B00008EY9G|5.0|A solid script backed up by a great cast, John Cusack, Ray Liotta, John c. McGinley, Alfred Molina, Amanda Peet and more, are all outstanding. Brilliantly directed by James Mangold who also directed Copland, Girl Intrerupted and Walk The Line, this is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. To say too much about the script would possibly give it away, but in the style of the Agatha Christie's novels 'Ten Little Indians' and  'Murder on the orient express', where people start dying in suspicious circumstances and later they find out they are all connected in some way. In this movie we have ten complete strangers stranded at a desert motel for the night. Sure enough people start getting killed, there is a lot of finger pointing and plenty of twists along the way to keep the audience engaged. The music score is excellent and perfectly captures the mood of the whole movie. Special features include bonus trailers, an on the set documentary and 2 very informative and interesting commentaries. One by the director and one by the writer, the latter being the better of the two. The disc features both cinema and DVD versions, although the DVD version only includes 2 extra scenes that last no longer than 30 seconds each. The only fault I have of the movie is that it seems too much time was spent in the first half of the movie bringing the characters together and laying a foundation forcing the ending to seem rushed through to conclude the movie within the 90 minutes, instead of the film being possibly edited longer. All up though, one of the best thrillers you will ever see. I have seen it many times and it is still good even when you know the ending.
B00005JPAD|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of cheeky gangster films that are both humorous and bloody. They amuse me, but they have little emotional impact. Though at times hilarious, this is not one of those films.    The plot sold me. Either searching for a mole in the police department or following an undercover cop alongside a mad mob boss would have been enough. But both are in one movie. (Note: I'm afraid I hadn't seen Internal Affairs, which I hear has the same plot.)    Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan, the undercover police agent. Costigan's family is peopled with criminals, and he himself has a fierce temper. According to his superiors, Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Mark Wahlberg's Dignam, Costigan is also too intelligent and perhaps idealistic to be a cop. Thus, Costigan must gain the trust of Jack Nicholson's insane, unforgiving, and amusing Frank Costello, an Irish mafia kingpin.    While one half of the plot monitors Costigan, the other follows Matt Damon's Colin Sullivan. Rather, the story-line revolves around the two of them. Sullivan is essentially Costigan's opposite, even though they have identical tasks and similar upbringings. Sullivan is the mafia's mole, nurtured by Costello from youth. He is a trusted, pragmatic police officer who is assigned to find Costello's mole - himself, of course. This means bad news for Costigan and possibly for Sullivan.    This tale has countless \\"gasp\\" moments as key information is revealed to us or to unwitting characters for the first time. Scorsese lets us thoroughly invest in the characters, feeling their pain and fear.    Acting is outstanding all around. DiCaprio is extremely sympathetic as Costigan. He is as passionate as Sullivan is empty. Damon is also excellent as Sullivan, a subtly drawn but disturbing character whose duplicity knows no ends. Nicholson is batty, merciless, but almost likable as Costello. Wahlberg is hysterical as the verbally abusive and fiery Dignam. Despite his cruel attitude towards Costigan, Dignam stubbornly protects him from exposure. Martin Sheen is likable as Queenan, and Ray Winstone is suitably dead eyed as the violent Mr. French. A special note must be given to Alec Baldwin. His police officer Ellerby is witty and perhaps on crack. (Not literally.)    Vera Farmiga also plays an complex character. Madolyn is one of the only women in the film who is more than just decoration for the male characters. Her relationship with both Sullivan and Costigan further compares and contrasts the two men. Sullivan has money, and is clean cut and insensitive. Costigan is a drug addicted mess, but he displays genuine affection for and interest in Madolyn. Their sexual relationships are quite different as well. She is a smart woman making foolish choices.    This movie is a series of wonderful quotes and moments. Various themes are threaded throughout this tense story. The parallels drawn between Costigan and Sullivan are fascinating. Sweeping camera shots and a variety of memorable music set the mood. The lyrics of Comfortably Numb are too perfect, as is the tone of every song. The Departed This film is about survival, which makes for an intense, entertaining, and powerful experience.
B00006V9A0|4.0|To all Nirvana fans this is a worthwhile purchase for the opening track 'You know you're right'. Its a great song that is worth paying money for on its own. It is the only new song on the record which also features a best of... Which is not necessarily the best of Nirvana, just a collection of radio singles. Its good to have all of them on the one disc anyway.
B00005R1N3|4.0|This is one of those movies that will likely stay with you for one reason or another a while after viewing it. Initially for me, the ending left too many unanswered questions, such as: who is Billy and why is he terrorizing and killing these young women? The ambiguity didn't set very well with me at first, though the more I thought about it, the more I came to regard it as more positive than negative. I am weary of horror/mystery movies trying to introduce several possible killers and motives, only to clumsily force it all together at the climax. That is usually either too contrived to be effective or too obvious to make it worth the time we spend watching it. *Possible spoilers* \\"Black Christmas\\" doesn't offer a motive or even tell us who the killer is, which leaves a very chilling effect on the viewer. The unknown is always more frightening than what is known, which is why this film is effective. Sorority sisters regard obscene phone calls as a prank, at least until a local thirteen-year-old girl is found murdered. Suddenly the disappearance of fellow sister, Clare, seems much more ominous than it had previously. The police begin surveillance of the sorority house and tap the phones in an attempt to trace the calls. Will their efforts prove successful? The cast, especially Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder and John Saxon, is quite good. The writing, direction and above all the inventive cinematography are all wonderful. Good movie, but the 25th anniversary edition is FULL SCREEN. Argh!

0743298020|5.0|\\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" was one of the most enjoyable novels I have turned an eye to in years.  The carefully crafted prose, the excruciatingly detailed scenery, and the memorable (how can one forget Adeline!) cast of characters, all speak volumes to Ms. Setterfield's wondrous literary talent. <br /> <br />Perhaps what I enjoyed most about \\"Tale\\" was the High Gothic environment of Angelfield House and the haunting history of the family of the same name.  Miss Vida Winter -- whose long-secret personal story is inextricably linked with that of the Angelfield tale -- is a remarkable personage.  Margaret Lea, her biographer, I did find less interesting -- but I believe the author would have wished that.  The \\"Tale\\", after all, is far more Miss Winter's than Margaret's. <br /> <br />This was one of the rare reads I've devoured with relish, only to have the storyline stay with me for days after having completed the reading of it.  That, I consider, to be the most telling hallmark of a truly GOOD BOOK. <br /> <br />I am most anxious to read Ms. Setterfield's future works.
0316921173|5.0|This book hit me at the right time in my life to now be etched into my soul. Having a close friend going through a 12 step program and newly working for a Canadian company made much of this hit close to home.  <br /> <br />That being said, I still think this book has something in it for everyone. The plot lines are too massive to be summarized but there is a plot and unlike many reviews state, there is an ending - it is just not the last pages of the book. <br /> <br />The size is off putting and you have to slog through about 100 pages before you find the pace, but it is worth it. This is one of those rare books that is both laugh out loud funny and so serious it makes you look at your life a different way.  I certainly have a more active awareness of our nations (and my own) dual obsession with achievement and entertainment/relaxation. <br /> <br />Make the commitment - you will not be sorry. <br />
B000ASDFEU|4.0|I saw this movie on the big screen when it came out in 1977 and at the time I thought, Wow! because of the lengths they went to to recreate the various battles, equipment, aircraft, etc. <br /> <br />It was with a sense of nostalgia that I bought the collector's edition DVD in 2006. I eagerly popped it into my new TV/DVD player as soon as it arrived - and discovered that big screen does not always translate well into small screen in terms of visual and dramatic impact. That said, \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" is still one of the best war movies ever made, in terms of scope, presentation and attention to detail. However, I can readily see how someone who is not a student of WWII history could get lost as the movie jumps from scene to scene, and if you don't have even a basic grasp of geography, you're going to be confused more often than not, because the movie only offers a brief (about 2 minute) look at the Market-Garden plan in the form of a (ridiculously oversized) map as the key generals are briefed in on things. <br /> <br />The battle scenes are well executed and seem fairly realistic, as do the pauses and stretches where not much is going on - that's the way it is in real life, and this movie was attempting to capture the essence of one of the major battles of WWII, not do another cheap action flick! \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" does a good job of putting you in the middle of each situation, and allows you to experience it much as the people who were actually involved might have. <br /> <br />I can't say as much about the bonus disc - I could never get the picture slide shows to work, and I would have liked to have seen a lot more of the behind the scenes efforts the producers had to go through to state some of the battles in the same locations the real ones were fought in. All in all, though, an enjoyable movie that should be in any WWII buffs collection. <br />
0060254920|5.0|Excuse me as I let \\"Little Johnny\\"...my five year old inner child review this book...<br /><br />Hi. I loved this book. This book was great. This book made me laugh. I liked Max. I liked Max and how he put on a wolf suit. Max was funny when he went to the Island of the Monsters. My favorite monster was the one with the horns. I liked the drawings. I liked the story. I thought it was really, really good. Can I have some ice cream now?<br /><br />Thanks \\"Little Johnny\\" and yes, you may have some ice cream, just save some for me.<br /><br />As you can see by \\"Little Johnny's\\" review, the book is absolutely great and he's right. I think that this book is in its 9 millionth printing. It's the kind of book that will never age. Everything else will, but this book will always stay the same. I remember wanting to be able to draw just like Maurice Sendak. My mom said that she sent a few of them to him to Mr. Sendak, but he never replied, so if you are reading this Mr. Sendak, uh, could you look in your pile of fan mail and see if you have a large yellow manilla envelope that's postdated from 1969? My pictures are in there...by the way, my \\"Inner Child\\" says, \\"Hi\\"...<br /><br />There are a few things that I hope I never get tired of (1) Being able to feel the Presence of Love around me and within me, (2) Being able to laugh at myself and (3) Maurice Sendak's, Where the Wild Things Are. It's just a wonderful snapshot of my childhood that brings me pleasure every time I read it.<br /><br />Time for some ice cream, that is, if \\"Little Johnny\\" saved me some. The last few times he didn't. Oh, well...kids will be kids...<br /><br />Peace and Blessings
0618477942|5.0|I've read graphic novels for, oh, about forever now.  I especially love the works of Neil Gaiman and Terry Moore.  Things that really make you think, and yet also grab your viscera and tug hard.<br /><br />This consuming work is all about family.  The kind we all really have, but rarely examine too closely.  Bechdel dissects the artifice necessary in order to maintain the facade of the traditional nuclear family using her relationship with her father.<br /><br />Truthfully, when we are \\"mother\\" or \\"father\\" or even \\"daughter,\\" we are all slipping somewhat into the realm of fantasy.  Our authentic selves are rarely able to be confined within the expectations society has of each of those iconic roles.<br /><br />I am struggling not to become \\"mother\\" to the exclusion of all else I can be.  I could empathize with Bechdel's mother's situation.  So much given up.  Yes, I love my children.  But after reading Bechdel's account of how her mother's anger at her loss of self played out for her daughter, I wonder how much my children already understand of my resentment that marriage and motherhood demand so much of women.<br /><br />And yet the author conveys her understanding and compassion toward her parents.  She can see how each was shaped or warped by unrealistic and anti-human societal expectations, as she fights so vigorously against being constrained by the same.<br /><br />A beautiful and haunting book.  Highly recommended.
0807126063|5.0|I don't know why I never knew about A Confederacy of Dunces when it was first published. But I just listened to it as an audiobook, and it was one of the most enjoyable books I've experienced in years.  The book is an impressive character study and commentary on New Orleans and the world in general in the early 1960's. Everyone of the characters in this story is so lifelike and beautifully crafted so that you feel these are people you know, not just characters in a book. The dialogue is pure genius.<br /><br />The protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly, is hilarious as the big, intellectual slob who is always criticizing and pontificating at everyone from his mother to the people who are trying to buy hot dogs from him on the street. The Jones character is superb:  the super-wise and wisecracking, cynical down-and-out black man.  I loved them all:  Ignatius, his mother Irene, Mr. and Mrs. Levy, Patrolman Mancuso, Lana Lee, Darlene, Miss Annie.  Well, maybe not Myrna Minkoff and Miss Trixie so much.  But they all had a role to play. I simply didn't want the book to end; it was like losing your new-found friends.<br /><br />This is a book you don't want to miss.  Read it or better yet, buy it as the audiobook read by Barrett Whitener. You are in for a rare treat.
B000GG4Y3M|4.0|REVIEW: The year is 1989 and so far in that decade we had some pretty cheesy action films. However, Ridley Scott took his approach to this story that if handled by anyone else would have ended up probably like any other 80's action flick. The story follows a renegade cop played by Michael Douglas and his partner played by Andy Garcia as they travel to Japan to deliver a convicted Japanese murderer back to the Japanese police to be imprisoned. When they arrive they are met by the police and hand over the prisoner, but things aren't that easy. The seemingly legit police officers were actually in disguise, and now Nick and Charlie clash with the Japanese culture and with their assigned guide from the Japanese police played by Ken Takakura.<br /><br />The film follows the formula and if you put your head to it then of course this film will seem unoriginal, but that's not the point. I don't think anyone on the film thought they were creating a masterpiece. Ridley Scott is best known for creating worlds and really utilizing the setting of a film to shape the characters. Here he has Japan, a completely foreign land to most Americans, and he utilizes the setting perfectly. The film is very dark, color-wise. Most of the scenes take place at night and that's where we get the film's really vibrant lighting. Jan De Bont's cinematography really brings notice to the concrete jungle that is Japan and most of the scenes are lit by neon and florescent lights. This adds a harsh dark side to Michael Douglas' character, and that's appropriate since he is a flawed hero. Nick (Douglas) is not a likeable character at all, and that is why Charlie (Andy Garcia) is his partner. Charlie brings humor and charm to the film and the first half of the picture is actually carried on that character. Once we are focused on Douglas's character the film picks up speed and really opens more of his character as he builds a relationship with the Japanese policeman, Matsumoto (Takakura).<br /><br />Michael Douglas gives his character a rough edge and he closes him up for the first two acts, and not until the third act do we see him start to open up. Douglas does a great job at crafting this flawed character. Andy Garcia is perfect as Douglas's opposite and brings the movie much needed life. Ken Takakura who has not done any American films besides this is great as a supporting character. Our villain is played by Yusaka Matsuda, one of those typical 80's action bad guys who doesn't talk that much and is all about the stare. It's the acting and the characters that makes this film's plot stand out from the rest, because if it were not for the characters then this movie would be forgotten in a month. Yes, Ridley Scott did craft the film into his style, and that did wonders for it, but if he had flat characters then it would be wasted.<br /><br />VIDEO: The film is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen. I was pretty bothered by the picture unfortunately. This transfer does not handle black well at all. In some scenes you can barely see the actors' faces, and I know that was not intentional from a creative standpoint. Jan De Bont's vivid lighting is brought to life and the neon shines sharply, but the picture overall is very soft. You will notice the blurriness of the picture mostly at the end of the film in the wine vineyard because it takes place during the day. Overall, not to impressed, especially since this is a double-dip.<br /><br />AUDIO: The sound on the other hand is top notch. The old disc had a Dolby 5.1 mix, but with this new release we have an incredibly dynamic Dolby Digital 5.1 EX mix. The picture is more about the atmosphere than it is about action, but it definitely enriched the viewing experience.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES: The old release was barebones, and surprisingly I was impressed with what was put together for this release. The bonus features consist of a \\"making of\\" documentary broken into 4 parts. The first part is about the pre-productionof the film and runs for about 28 minutes. They go into the script and how they cast the film, it's great stuff. The production of the film is broken into two sections, a 20 minute part and a 7 minute part. They talk about the problems they had filming in Japan and how it was completely different than filming in America. We hear from the costume designer, the producers, the actors, Jan De Bont and his goals for the look of the film, and of course Ridley. The post production section talks about editing the film, scoring the film, and then the release of the film and public response. Hans Zimmer gets significant screen time and talks about his first film with Ridley Scott which would later lead to an incredible partnership. Zimmer is my idol and it was great watching him discuss this early work of his that would later become the structure for his scores to Batman Begins and The Last Samurai. There is also lots of resemblance to his score to Rain Man, which is how Ridley discovered him.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The film follows the formula, but Scott brings a new point of view to it and created a memorable, exciting, and entertaining picture. This is not the best film ever made and it's not Scott's best film, but it's a great action film that does everything it sets out to do.production of the film and runs for about 28 minutes.

B00005JKN9|3.0|I think Daniel Day Lewis made this whole picture. Goldenboy Leonardo and Shameron Diaz bogged it down.    I love the whole idea of the movie. I read a book by Luc Sante entitled, These Were The Good Old Days, which chronicled the maggots which infested New York's rotten apple in the early 1900s.    It would be interesting if Scorsese showed the life of a typical family living under such horrible conditions.    I love Butcher Bill's centennial eyeball. The pseudo-patriots of today would give him a wink.
B0000060NF|5.0|In 1971 I lived in a very well integrated neighborhood. We had the Romants who were Puerto Rican who lived a few doors down from us, the Sakai's, who were Japanesese, lived next door to the Jones and the Jones who were a black family lived next door to us. Mr. and Mrs. Jones were my mom and dad's best friends'. we did everything together. I'm sure we got stared at quite a bit because I guess there were still a few people who couldn't handle seeing black and white people being friendly with each other and even letting their children play with each other. I can assure you, none of us were hurt in the process. In fact, we learned a real \\"silly thing\\". We learned that all people are pretty much the same. That no matter what you may look on the outside, your soul still looks the same to God who made you out of \\"His\\" Colorless Self...because as my mother would say, Love has no color...<br /><br />But anyway, flashing back to 1971, we were at a barbecue at the Jones' house, and Alicia, their oldest daughter, who was 15 at the time (and who I had a mad crush on)came out of the house wearing this pretty yellow sundress and holding this record. She carefully took it out of its cover and put it on. I just remember it getting very, very quiet. It was like each and every song took our breath away. I remember after the record played, Alicia wanted to play it again, and Mrs. Jones wiped a few tears from her eyes simply said, \\"Another time, dear...another time...\\"<br /><br />This album is heavy. It's not party music. It really makes you think and feel about your place in the world. We have become such a plastic coated society. It is like we are numb to everything that is going on in the world. Oh, I see North Korea has a nuclear weapon that they want to test, ho-hum...pass the butter...WHAT? PARIS HILTON GOT ARRESTED FOR DRUNK DRIVING! OH, THE INHUMANITY! It's a weird world in which we live in. There are somedays I am just thrilled to the bone to be a part of such a lovely world and then there are other days when I just want to stick my head in the sand.<br /><br />I consider Marvin Gaye a prophet, a very unlikely prophet, but if you really think about it, all the truly great people didn't look like they would amount to much, at the time...\\"Oh, you didn't invite that Jesus kid from Nazareth over, did you? He's always making the water taste funny...\\" But Marvin sang about what we all wanted to sing about. He talked about the war, about the ecology, about people that felt oppressed and lost and confused and I don't think he was just singing to people of his own race, I think he was singing to all of us.<br /><br />This record will be 36 years old in 2007 and it is still just as relevant. And even though I haven't lived in that old neighborhood of mine in years, I still feel very lucky that I lived in a \\"world\\" where I was exposed to different ideas, different beliefs, different ways of being in the world because it just makes me realize that the only thjing that we all have in common is that we are all so diverse and it's a beautiful thing.<br /><br />Peace and Blessingsother days when I just want to stick my head in the sand.

B000GG4XJM|5.0|I highly recommend this American Land version of \\"We Shall Overcome The Seeger Sessions\\" for two distinct reasons. For any Springsteen fan who didn't purchase the first release, you definately cheated yourself of some absolutely great music. Bruce gave a big kick [...] to priceless folk songs that are for the majority over a hundred years old. And, The Seeger Sessions Band is just phenomenal!    For those who purchased The Dual/Disc, this one will make up for any squables that you had with the Dual/Disc. It seemed that there were alot of people trashing the Dual/Disc concept, but didn't really say why. Personally, I had a problem with it, but I'll elaborate a little on my problems. I purchased it, and after playing the CD side in three different CD players, the CD side continued to get scratches more and more as I played it to the point where it started skipping and screeching. I exchanged it, and the second one did the same thing. But, Sony was nice enough to send me another one that was only the CD. After Devils and Dust, I didn't think there was anything wrong with the Dual/Disc concept because of having no problems with it.    The other reasons for repeat buyers to purchase The American Land Edition are two-fold. The addition of 5 new songs to the CD is simply great(should have been done in the first place, but I think that a couple were added due to becoming favorites on the tour). They are \\"Buffalo Gals\\", How Can I Keep From Singing\\", \\"How Can A Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live, \\"Bring 'Em Home\\", and \\"American Land\\". The DVD is phenomenal! It includes an extended recording session and 4 Live Tour performances which are \\"How Can A Poor Man Stand Such Times And Live\\", \\"Bring 'Em Home, \\"American Land\\", and \\"Pay Me My Money Down\\".These will blow you away! Now, if this doesn't get fans to want to go out and see the live show nothing will! Without a doubt, one of the releases of 2006, and should be a shoe-in for some sort of award on the so-called award shows that, I think, have more politics involved in them than Wahington, DC. I hope those who haven't purchased this yet enjoy it as much as I have. I don't think you will be disappointed.
B000EGDC0A|2.0|After first hearing Goldfrapp's wonderfully, mystic vocals, soundscapes, and odd instruments on Felt Mountain, I was anxious to hear what more this original artist could dish out.  She was original and quite on the odd side, which in turn I felt a strange allure to her music.  Her intricate musical arrangements and odd instruments was like a mirror image of Bjork and other great electroinca artist.  Her lyrics were complex, poetic, and poignant.  I waited to hear powerful and beautiful vocals escaping from her opera capable voice range.  Felt Mountain was wonderful, yet lacked the full vocal range I knew she could reach.  I couldn't wait to here her new album.  However, in the album Supernature, she diminished into an unoriginal 80's music reject artist with synthesized vocals that were so talentless that I believe the original Goldfrapp was kidnapped and replaced.  Her lyrics also transformed into insipid fairy tale rhymes with no depth.  One example is the odd creative song Deer Stop from her first album Felt Mountain:    Deer stop bottle in a shell   Shoot a thousand stars over me  Say my name whisper it   I am deliciously wired    Strangely enough the lyrics in the new song `Ride a White Horse' describes her descend into trite cheapened music.    In the whirlpool  We'll go deeper  In this world that's   Getting cheaper  I wanna ride on a white horse    Her collaborations with such talented trip-hop artist such as Tricky, Orbital and Depeche Mode no longer exist, and she has fallen into the depths of the mass media's taste of insipid pop-like bubblegum music. However her new style has put more money in her pockets; I hear her music on so many commercials and series now I know there is no way she will return to her original style.  I still enjoy songs from Supernature such as Fly Me Away and Ride a White Horse, but it just doesn't reach the emotional deeps of her previous work.  This exotic electronica artist with the once deeply sensual and mysterious voice is gone but I hope that one day she will return to Felt Mountain; and give us a glorious view of what vocal heights she can reach.
B000001FFR|5.0|This album showcases Anthrax in their glory.  This music was my introduction to metal.  Before I heard Anthrax I thought metal was all cheezy hair glam bands on MTV.  Anthrax showed me how to rock.  This album is one of their best and definately a metal classic.     It manages to be melodic and yet blisteringly fast at the same time.
068485743X|3.0|Mr. Lukeman's style is a little flowery for my taste, but the premise is excellent--how to get an agent or an editor to read beyond page five.  To be fair, the first chapter sort of does this, though I didn't learn anything really new.  I wish he had written the book I thought I was buying.  Instead this one turns out to be just another elementary guide teaching idiots and novices how to write good.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|OK: <br />Here goes: <br /> I personally called Fontana distribution and spoke with an account manager to finally clear this mess up. <br />YES, it is true. WALMART will have the bonus disc of 1977 LARGO and BEST BUY will have the 1st night of the COBO HALL 76 and all other retailers including AMAZON will have the bonus disc of MADISON SQUARE GARDEN 1977. The bonus discs DO NOT have the complete shows on them. They will contain 7 to 12 songs each. I have been in contact with some folks that have advance copies of this long awaited release and they assure me that it will be worth the wait. I was also able to get some unconfirmed \\"GOSSIP\\" regarding the next 2 volumes. There is a possibility that volume 2 will contain a FULL show from the CREATURES OF THE NIGHT tour with Vinnie Vincent. It is from New Orleans in 1983. I repeat::: I am NOT able to confirm this. Only time will tell. I hope this clears up all the confusion.  <br />                                                         ROCK FORWARD;-) <br /> <br /> <br />
B000GRUS22|5.0|I give this album 5 stars because the songs are varied enough that they contain all the elements we love about Enigma.  Slow, Medium, and Fast electronic/melodic music.  This should have been the follow up in 2003 instead of Voyager.  I love Voyager but most traditional Enigma fans couldn't get used to the pop-style on some of the tracks.  This would have pleased them more.  Voayger, IMHO, is ahead of its time. <br /> <br />In my opinion 1996's \\"Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!\\" is still the best Enigma album, but this one is still a top-notch album with many great songs.  I wish the original version of \\"Hello! And Welcome\\" was on here instead of the non-vocal version.
0385751060|5.0|I thought this was an accurate portrayal of a boy of nine, and the way he views the world. His naivety, his innocence, and his perceptions of all that is going on around him, make Bruno a believable character. I picked up this book late at night and could not go to bed until I finished it.  <br /> <br />Is it a comprehensive book on the Holocaust? Certainly not. But does it give you a new perspective? Definitely. I will be reading this again with my son and talking to him about what happened during the Holocaust. This book would also be a great preparation for a trip to the Holocaust museum in Wash. D.C.  <br /> <br />Powerful. Highly recommended.
B00005JP5J|3.0|\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" has a lot going for it: all-star cast, OK writing, decent premise and an adorable child star. But something is missing, making the movie less than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />The story concerns Olive Hoover, a pudgy, bespectacled 10-year old who dreams of being a beauty queen. She has no chance in the world until the winner of a contest (in which Olive placed second) loses her crown. Suddenly, Olive has a shot at the Little Miss Sunshine crown - if only her dysfunctional family can get its act together and help her get to the contest!<br /><br />LMS is another in a long line of \\"funny\\" movies about dysfunctional families. But this one inexpertly negotiates the fine line between crazy people being funny and crazy people being weird, mean or dangerous. Grandpa is a porn-addicted coker. Uncle tried slit his wrists - a very unfunny way to do oneself in. Brother is a Nietzsche freak who hates everyone and has taken a vow of silence. Dad is desperate to sell his pathetic self-help regimen. Only Mom is half-way sane, though how she keeps up with this gang of misfits is anyone's guess. In the hands of an accomplished writer, this might have worked, as it did every week for the writers of \\"Malcolm in the Middle.\\" But with LMS I found myself alternately horrified for or horrified by the cruelty and pathetic weirdness of this bunch.<br /><br />I also found that the movie misfired in its attempt to satirize pre-pubescent beauty pageants. In post-Jon Benet America, the sight of people dressing their young daughters as sexy starlets is more than a little creepy.<br /><br />There was a very human and very funny movie lurking inside LMS. Maybe a different cast or a different set of writers could have set it free. As it was, I experienced it (and I expect that this is a minority view) as a rarely funny cringe-fest.
B000AP2ZLC|3.0|Yup. By all accounts Lord Worm's vocals are much stronger on older releases such as None so Vile, and I feel the need to check that out. This album shows great promise, particularly in the drumming department, but the vocals are so weak that I find myself actively trying to ignore them throughout the album. There is also some definite guitar-slop to be found, less than equal to the \\"technical metal\\" tag this band has recieved. Otherwise, this would be a 4-star release.
B000H305U0|3.0|Justin Timberlake's got a lot to live up to. It's been three years since his smash debut Justified and he's riding high on the charts with the techno-rap-loop of a song we know and love (or, in some cases, tolerate) as Sexy/Back. Needless to say, anticipation is high for his next move. <br /> <br />The highlights of FutureSex/LoveSounds come early: the throbbing robotic funk and infectious chorus of the title track, the extended disco romp Love Stoned/I Think She Knows and the dribbly synth splash of My Love. Or, as I like to call it: Cry Me A River Pt. Two. But, unfortunately there's just too much filler here (i.e. the entire second half of the record). The album takes a notable downturn around track seven, where Timberlake regurgitates lyrical banalities over blippy urban/techno beats that in the end all sound quite the same. By the time he reaches Losing My Way, which chronicles the plight of a cocaine addict (complete with choir at the end - and yet it still manages not to be moving), I couldn't really be bothered to care. <br /> <br />Luckily, the brilliance of the first five tracks on FutureSex/LoveSounds almost makes up for what follows. Without them, the album would have been extremely tedious (see the cringe-inducing ballad Until The End Of Time as evidence). Producer Timbaland's shadow looms over the entire record, even on the songs he didn't orchestrate. So, sonically the album sounds great. It's melody that's the problem. There just isn't enough of it. FutureSex/LoveSounds may be banging from car speakers this fall, but a couple years down the line and it's going to be very easy to forget. <br /> <br />Key Tracks: FutureSex/LoveSounds, My Love, Love Stoned/I Think She Knows
0743455967|5.0|Really.  It's a great book.  You should buy it.   You'll really like it.  I promise.  Unless you don't like informative books about writing and are not Stephen King fan.  Then you probably won't like this book.  But then why are you looking at this page?  <br /> <br /> I think you truly do like Stephen King and you will like this book.
B00005JPAD|3.0|Two young men from South Boston graduate into Massachusetts State Police and want to join its Special Investigative Unit. One is in the pocket of Frank Costello, the underworld thug and Irish Mafia kingpin who controls everything that goes on in Southie. The other is trying to transcend, by working for the police, the criminality that has marked his family. Throw in corrupt FBI, a gang of vicious and pitiless thugs and some decent acting, and you have \\"The Departed.\\"<br /><br />Leonardo DeCaprio stole this movie. His tortured performance as an informant inside Costello's gang required (and got) a virtuoso performance. Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin also were terrific. Standing out though was Mark Walberg (!) as Dingam, a profane but pure undercover cop who ends up being every recent cadet's worst nightmare.<br /><br />But in spite of the fine performances, \\"The Departed\\" left me unsatisfied. By the end, the struggles of the characters seemed pointless. This seemed less from a desire to deliver a deliberate message than from a lack of imagination. Let's see: the story about a crooked Boston cop, corrupt FBI and a murderous Southie mob boss was played much better in real life (with no neat ending) by the real Whitey Bulger. The tale seems uses Boston as a backdrop, though it's hard to recognize the city I know so well. The State House makes many conspicuous appearances, and the Zakim Bridge is used, but the Hancock Tower, Big Dig, Fenway Park, the Common and other Boston-y landmarks are missing. \\"R\\"-less Boston accents abound however, ludicrously (except for Damon) on the lips of many of the actors. And the idea of a police psychologist falling for not only one but two of her patients (setting up a love triangle) was almost too much to believe.<br /><br />Whatevah. \\"The Departed\\" is a gory, violent, twisted ride that in spite of its failings will keep you guessing until the end.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|<br />'This is what I brought you, this you can keep.  This is what I brought.  You may forget me.  I promise to depart, just promise one thing.  Kiss my eyes and lay me to sleep.'... <br /> <br />...and so begins AFI's latest album to date, which pretty much sums up the basis of the entire album; it's a poetic journey through sorrow and misery, and it's AFI's most polished effort to date. <br /> <br />Now, as for people downing this album.  Is it hardcore?  No.  Is it even punk?  Some parts maybe, but as a whole I'd have to say not really.  Is it AFI?  Yes, without a doubt.  And is it good?  Absolutely! <br /> <br />Let me explain.  Being an absolute AFI fanatic, I have every other AFI album.  So let me clear up a few misconceptions, because, being such a fan, the sheer volume of undeserving attack on this band is really getting to me. <br /> <br />Misconception #1:  It's not hardcore enough. <br /> <br />What do I say?  So what.  Get over it.  AFI already made two definite hardcore albums; Shut_Your_Mouth_And_Open_Your_Eyes, and Black_Sails_In_The_Sunset.  So buy those instead.  OR, if they aren't enough for you, here's a list of REALLY hardcore music to listen to: <br /> <br />Slayer - Reign_In_Blood - Speed Metal <br />Emperor - In_The_Nightside_Eclipse - Black Metal <br />Converge - You_Fail_Me - Extreme Hardcore <br />Pig Destroyer - Prowler_In_The_Yard - Extreme Hardcore <br />Meshuggah - Cryptopsy - Extreme Hardcore <br /> <br />Misconception #2:  AFI is losing it. <br /> <br />Losing what?  Speed, aggression?  Maybe.  But guess what?  That's not what they're going for here.  Don't you think that they could rehash Shut_Your_Mouth_And_Open_Your_Eyes with different lyrics if they wanted to?  Sure.  But instead, that's not what they decided to go for.  They went for something different, and let me tell you, it's not like what was before it, but it's still sure as Hell done right, for what it is.  Davey's poetic elloquence is still here, and it's more polishedand poetically inspiring than ever. <br /> <br />It's not every day that one wants to listen to Tom Araya scream about the Angel_Of_Death, or Emperor screech on in Norwegian, though those times have their place if that's your thing. <br /> <br />So, if you can't appreciate AFI for being AFI, then listen to harder music, but then you're not a fan of AFI, but a fan of hardcore music.   <br /> <br />But for those who can appreciate it, IT IS RECOMMENDED.  For those of you who can't, LAY OFF ALREADY.
B000HCO8IQ|5.0|Scissor Sisters' debut is one of my favorite albums of all time, so I'll admit a bias to this review straightaway. On the flipside, Ta-Dah had a lot to live up to. A lot. And, just like the instant-classic lead single I Don't Feel Like Dancin', the album passes with flying colors. <br /> <br />While the Sisters' debut was the introduction to their perverse color-pop world, Ta-Dah gives us the full vaudevillian production. The album is big, whether it's the choral vocals that lead into Ana-led Kiss You Off, the swampy stomp of She's My Man, or the theatrical, over-the-top Intermission. Upon first listen it's almost hard to find the songs buried in all of the glitz and glitter, but the album rewards repeat visits. In addition to catchy-as-hell disco/funk/rock concoctions (the theatrical honky-tonk of I Can't Decide and disco stormer Lights among many others), there are moments of pure honest (and moving) pop music. The Other Side and Might Tell You Tonight may appear late in the album's running order, but both offer shimmering mature melodies that, if released as singles, will surely become smashes for years to come. <br /> <br />Fans of the bands' more Filthy/Gorgeous moments will not be disappointed either, though they will have to wait until after the intermission for Paul McCartney and Ooh. While this pair of dance tracks may not touch the perversity of Filthy, they certainly replicate its sound. In fact, all of Ta-Dah revels in the Sisters' previous sounds, but it's not a rehash. Instead, it builds on their ambition and is all the better for it. With Ta-Dah, Scissor Sisters continue to produce some of the most relevant, interesting, and downright joyful pop music of our time. <br /> <br />Key Tracks: I Don't Feel Like Dancin', Might Tell You Tonight, She's My Man
B0006GAI6O|4.0|Dancing is a passion that you either like or don't like. How many times have you heard people around you say that they love dancing or that they don't like it at all?   Next to those two kind of people you have the people that don't know what to think of it yet cause they haven't danced that much in their lives. To those people, who want to see what dancing is about or if you want to be shown what dancing can do to a human being: watch this film.    Shall We Dance tells the story of John Clark, a man who takes care of people's wills for a living. He has a nice family and is happy with them, but still, something inside him doesn't feel happy. He misses something. He finally decides to take a look in a dancing school, where he starts following lessons in secret and gets his life changed.    Shall We Dance is a great feelgood film that gives a nice warm feeling. First of all, the film has fantastic actors that give fine acting performances. Richard Gere portrais his character in the exact right way. He lets the character show how he feels in situations very clearly and does that realistically with a whole lot of fun. He is charming and does a fine job as the leading role.  Next to Gere, there is Jennifer Lopez. If somebody is criticised on her acting skills a lot, it is Lopez. But don't you worry, Lopez does a fantastic job and is part of the feelgood factor. She acts warm, nice and shows the character's emotions in a succesfull way. Well done.   The rest of the cast is one big fun group. Susan Sarandon is perfectly choisen as John's wife and does the part with good acting. The film has hilarious supporting roles from Stanley Tucci, Lisa Ann Walter, Bobby Cannavale, Omar Miller and Anita Gillette who all bring the film to a level of great comedy and romantic fun.    Technically the film looks professional and perfectly fine. The dancing has been well shot and captured on camera. The editing and the lifting music together sure makes the film swing nicely. The lighting is great, the sets are fun and colorfull to see and the music is on the right track. All these elements together give the film a nice atmosphere that gives you, as the audience, a nice feeling inside. Thats what makes this film powerful in a way: the warm Atmosphere.   The comedy is hilarious at some points and the film has some nice jokes. The story may be a bit obvious and predictable, it still is a lot of fun for a night of movie entertainment. Romantic, funny, swinging, even a little drama here and there gives it a nice human touch.  A succesful film that lightens up one's spirit and leaves you with a nice big smile on your face.    If you love dancing this film is an absolute must see for you. If you love romantic comedies, I would also recommend you this film.   If you don't like dancing at all but you love the feeling you get from the movies and the vibe it gives you: just take a look, give it a try and who knows? Maybe you will be linening up in a dancing school only a few days later...  \\"Shall we Dance?\\"  \\"I'd love to!\\"  Enjoy and most importantly: have fun watching this film!
0440242576|5.0|This is the book \\"Christmas with the Kranks\\" was based on.  This was a surprisingly enjoyable, cute read about Christmas and the desire to skip it all together, and avoid the mega-hype for a year.  Totally different from anything Grisham has written, as far as I know.  Short and sweet, you'll smile along, laugh and relax while reading this book.
B000GY729M|5.0|Welcome to Sam's Town, a place of broken dreams, rugged landscapes, and huge rolling choruses. The Killers' new album is murkier than their last, which means it's a grower. Gone are the gleaming synth lines and angular guitar, replaced instead by a generous helping of pomp and stadium-friendly rock. <br /> <br /> <br />The potential of this formula doesn't really reveal itself until three tracks in, with the glorious first single When You Were Young. From there the album propels into the anthematic splendor that lead singer Brandon Flowers has decreed in so very many interviews. The ridiculously titled Bling (Confessions Of A King) is another early-album highlight, sounding like a mix between U2, Duran Duran and Deep Forest. It's dance-rock at its best. Second single Bones is also interesting. Of all the songs, it takes advantage of the Killers' new barrage of sounds most completely. A brass section here, a choir there. Other songs seek to build on the band's earlier work, with varying success. Why Do I Keep Counting? revisits the much-loved \\"I've got soul but I'm not a soldier\\" section from All These Things That I've Done and builds a whole song out of that sound. It's one of the most epic things the Killers have produced thus far. On the flipside, Uncle Johnny is simply Andy, You're A Star without the provocative androgyny. <br /> <br />Sam's Town may not end up matching the runaway success of Hot Fuss, but it is at least as good as that record... in different ways, of course. Hot Fuss was made for the dance floor, for dark corners in secret places. Sam's Town is the complete opposite, at home on open roads, mountain tops, and standing in front of thousands and thousands of screaming fans. <br /> <br />Key Tracks: When You Were Young, Bling (Confessions Of A King), Bones
0618680004|1.0|The secular, objective study of religion has been pursued since the late nineteenth century by comparative scholars such as Friedrich Max Müller, philosophers and psychologists including William James, and sociologists and other erudite scholars such as Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, and Joachim Wach. Over the past decade a new spate of books have been written by scientists and philosophers including Edward O. Wilson, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris, and Richard Dawkins who are approaching the topic as if they were inventing the scientific study of religion. None of these writers is professionally trained in the study of religion, but they all share a powerful bias against religion and a woefully inadequate knowledge of any of the world's spiritual traditions. In other words, for all their claims to be \\"scientific,\\" their research into this field is unprofessional and their entire approach to the subject is one of extreme prejudice. It is as if these interlopers in the field of religious studies were treating this discipline as a public restroom in which they enter only in order to relieve themselves and write graffiti on the walls. For anyone who is already an atheist, their work will simply reaffirm their current beliefs; for anyone who is religious, their work is offensive and uninformative; and to those who are agnostic, such books are a mere distraction from serious critiques by reputable scientists and scholars. But for those who are fascinated by graffiti, read on!
B000AGTPUA|1.0|The picture book of the same name by Chris Van Allsberg is one of my favorite Christmas stories of all times.  So I was pretty excited to hear Hollywood was making a movie version and a great actor like Tom Hanks was a leading participant.   What a disappointment!  The movie's tone is empty and wintery at best and at worst downright creepy.  There are macabre touches throughout the movie with the most memorable being a mysterious hobo (apparently supernatural?)  who appears on top of the train from time to time and utters interesting Christmas messages such as \\"Do you believe in Ghosts?\\"  The \\"lighter\\" scenes are so frenzied and overblown they do nothing to give the viewer a more cheerful holiday feeling.  Admittedly I saw the movie in DVD format on the small screen and I am told many of the scenes played better in 3D.  Yet \\"The Polar Express\\" still remains a highly unusual and uniquely unmerry Christmas movie especially for a presumed target audience of families with young children.
B000H5U65C|5.0|Leviathan was a release that sat ignored for a period of time,only making an appearance now and again for the occasional 3 track listen. I just wasnt into it. Then I had a chance to hear on the all music choice channel the track Capillarian Crest,and it really made me sit up and take notice. I cant really say anything that previous reviewers havent already said,but I have defenitely gained a new respect for these guys as technically proficient musicians and premier songwriters. The new release is rife with twists and turns that bring to mind a number of progressive bands of yore,particularly Rush, although the music of Mastodon is much heavier and oppressive than anything by Rush. What stands out the most for me is the sheer level of talent in a heavier type band,something that is refreshing nowadays. There are a variety of lush aural landscapes to please the most aggressive metal fan,as well as many moments that bring to mind the best interludes of some Opeth tracks. There are stop/start progressions and time changes a plenty,but the thing that stands out the most is the atmosphere that is created. This is one of a small handful of CDs in recent memory I did NOT hit the skip button from beginning to end. Overall,these guys are really on to something,and if this is an indication of where the bands heading,Id say the best is yet to come. Fantastic music and a must have for all lovers of heavy music. By the way, Blood Mountain propelled me into a more in-depth listen of Leviathan,and that will also be a 5star review. Though very different in many ways from Leviathan,Blood Mountain showcases a band that really knows how to play their instruments,as well as construct killer songs that defenitely leave an impression. Guaranteed not to disappoint!
B000001FKY|5.0|I have been a fan of Def Leppard since 1980. And every album offers something new to fans. Hysteria reached out and touched more of the Top 40 crowd with Pour Some Sugar on me. But songs like Gods of War and Run Riot rocked hard still. This tour was one of the most amazing concerts I had ever seen. Especially with the return of Rick Allen the THUNDER GOD. <br />They are not a hair band, or a heavy metal band. They are a rock band changing with the time. ROCK ON
B000GPIPT2|5.0|The \\"monster-drowns-Little-Maria\\" scene and the Colin Clive \\"God\\" line were both already restored in the Legacy Collection box set.
B000BM6AVA|1.0|Daron Malakian really ruined this record.  Remembered when GNR had Duff and Izzy sing on songs? luckily they were on 3 tracks in a 2 album span. Unfortunately, Daron sucks worse at singing and he looks like an Iraqi Pee Wee Herman! <br /> <br />She's like heroine.... no daron, she doesn't. She just doesn't like your singing on this song! <br /> <br />Hypnotize... was this about suckering fans into buying records cuz they were hypnotized through the greatness of the Toxcity record? <br /> <br />Attack!... fans should start yelling at Daron for his crappy vocals on this CD. <br /> <br />U-Fig - Do you mean F U Daron? <br /> <br />Daron (who looks like the Iraqi Weird Al) should be really upset about this record. Actually he is cuz isn't this band on hiatus. <br /> <br />Terrible album, keep away!
0143036742|5.0|Sincere, nostalgic.<br /><br />If you are an emigrant from THAT side of the world, you'll understand.<br /><br />This novel is not dirty, sarcastic or pessimistic (nothing like Edik Limonov). You will hear a lot of strings that will resonate in your heart.<br /><br />I loved this novel.
B000002KGT|5.0|If there's anyone between the ages of 40 and 60 today that isn't thoroughly familiar with this album, then they're either insane or have been living in a bomb shelter since the 1960's.  A lot has been made over time of the breakups of the personal relationships within Fleetwood Mac and how it influenced the music.  No question, that is true.  But this is a different point of view regarding this album.  What's more interesting to me is how the music, plain and simple, shines. Just listening to the first 30 seconds of \\"Second Hand News\\" puts a smile on your face, in spite of its less than optimistic message.  And in spite of its downer theme, \\"Go Your Own Way\\" rocks happily along, as does \\"I Don't Want To Know\\".  So what does this mean?  That the band sought the escape through the music and was using it to heal, not vent.  The bandmembers, to a person, were not mourning and whining; they were licking their wounds and moving on.  How else could the message of \\"Don't Stop\\" shine through so clearly? The dark tones of \\"Dreams\\", \\"The Chain\\" and \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" represent more of Stevie Nicks' personal musical styling than anything else.  As a Canadian, I can't help but subscribe to the theory of Marshall McLuhan - \\"The medium is the message\\" - and by selecting such positive music, Fleetwood Mac produced its greatest success by giving us hope in their darkness. \\"It'll be better than before/Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone\\".
B000005JEG|5.0|Many critics initially reviled this album when it first appeared in 1973, though Tull fans loved it so much that it went to number one on the charts. With the passing of time better explanations of the music exist and music has evolved to the point where the music of \\"A Passion Play\\" has achieved a better perspective.<br /><br />The music and the composition, confusing as it may initially appear, was an attempt to create an epic and eclectic work. In some ways the work is unfinished, because the original studio sessions stopped before the original concept was completed, and thus Jethro Tull had to cut three albums sides of material to two. Some of the music originally intended for this album appeared on later albums; one example is \\"Skating Away on the Thin Ice of a New Day,\\" which eventually appeared in \\"Warchild.\\"<br /><br />The album was intended to tell the story of a recently-deceased man seeing his own funeral, and his journey in the afterlife, including purgatory and hell, and eventual reincarnation. In addition to this primary story was the inclusion of \\"The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles,\\" a story likened to stories from Winnie the Pooh to Peter and the Wolf.<br /><br />\\"A Passion Play\\" combines ten tracks into a single work (according to the official Jethro Tull web site - not according to the track listing for this album). As in \\"Thick as a Brick,\\" there is an occasional uneven spot in the transition from one track to the next. However, as in the earlier album, the transitions and concept works nearly as well. The music is certainly well refined, with hard-driving rock riffs, drums and synthesizers keeping Jethro Tull at the more experimental, progressive edge of rock. I warn you, though, that the music requires a good sound system to be able to listen to music that extends from very quiet to very loud, and the range of styles is similarly broad. I compare this music to classical music, which similarly has sounds that extend from soft to loud and also requires a good sound system. I also warn you to attempt to understand the lyrics at your own peril. The lyrics verge on the incomprehensible, even for those who have studied them at length. The lyrics are poetic and symbolic, and attempt to describe events and concepts barely attainable by the human mind, much less by a human language.<br /><br />Music such as this does not attempt to pander to a \\"style\\" or to commercial success. This music is art. Thus, a listener should interpret the meaning, significance and relevance of the music individually. I will not pretend to tell you that I understand this work in its entirety. Perhaps Jethro Tull never intended for listeners to understand the music, in the manner of Yes's \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans.\\"<br /><br />Note that there are several versions of this CD, with varying price and availability.  If you plan to purchase this CD, I recommend you survey the variations available and their price and choose the version that best fits your needs.<br /><br />While I may not be able to define or understand progressive rock, I know it when I hear it, and this music is definitely progressive rock. Listen to this music only if you are prepared to be open-minded and to accept it for what Jethro Tull and Ian Anderson attempted to do, and not for the misguided interpretations of those who think they have the divine ability to judge the work of an artist as trash.<br /><br />Enjoy!o loud and also requires a good sound system.

B000002GVO|5.0|This album remains a classic to this day, and sounds fresh still.  The Eagles were moving towards a rockier sound at this stage of their career, having scored a big hit with the most mainstream album of their career, 1975's \\"One Of These Nights\\".  With the darker images of that title track freshly on their mind, the band sought to use the newly adopted style to comment on the seamier side of life in Southern California.  The rougher, darker edge to their music perfectly complemented the biting commentary of \\"Hotel California\\", \\"Life In The Fast Lane\\" and \\"Victim Of Love\\".  But what truly separates this album is the styles they chose for the other songs.  \\"New Kid In Town\\", a tribute to the innocent youth moving into the dog-eat-dog music business, plays with a soft, pure country lilt; the slow, mournful blues of \\"Wasted Time\\" is in sharp contrast to the biting satire of the darker tunes; and the tone of \\"Try and Love Again\\" feels like jaded optimism.  Finally, the build of \\"The Last Resort\\" from near silence to a power anthem mirrors the fast-paced growth of not only the population of Southern California but also the growth of the arrival of the businesses willing to do anything to make a buck.  To suggest, as another reviewer has, that the Eagles were selling out to make more money, is not correct at all.  In fact, the band was thumbing its collective noses at the big businesses of the day, much like Tom Petty did in this decade with \\"The Last D.J.\\".  And if you can ever find a more thorough and biting commentary on the whirlwind that was SoCal in the late 1970's - buy it.  It would have to be amazing to outdo this one.
B00005JPBP|5.0|Christopher Nolan approached this movie much like batman begins, with even a very similar cast as Batman (Michael Caine and Christian Bale).  With dark/downtrodden sets, many camera angles, and a whole lot of action, this movie keeps you in suspense.  With a pseudo-historical basis, this movie is set in old london, where 2 young magicians lives start off as friends, but by a \\"Knot it time\\" they are split apart and apposed to each other until the end.  It is a very original movie, I have not seen anyting based around a subject like this before, or at least recently.  Check this movie out if you like films like Batman Begins, American Psycho, The Machienist, ect...all of which starred Christian Bale.  Again, casting was excellent in this film with Bale, Jackman, Caine, Johansen, Hall, and Perabo.  Also the very improtant spot of Nikola Tesla was filled by DAVID BOWIE, which was a great role for him, and his dark, proper, and mysterious character.  Check this movie out, well worth the price of admission.
0671015206|4.0|While this book is rather dry at parts, if you're truly interested in making the most of your money, you'll benefit from its insight. There are several things I keep in the back of my mind whenever I'm tempted to overspend: most millionaires drive regular cars, not new, fancy ones; and most don't live extravagantly, they work hard, spend wisely and let the majority of their money grow. Essentially, most millionaires live like middle class folk, they just know how to live within their means.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|In a day, where many new age teen horror movies are being born. This is fresh air in dying lungs. The Grudge, the Ring and whatever pg-13 teeny horror trash flavor of the month is out lately; it can not hold a candle to the flame that has been the \\"Saw\\" franchise. I do enjoy this one slightly more than \\"Saw 2\\" simply because I really enjoyed the plot, two guys chained to the bathroom. There is the birth of the saw franchise. Leigh Whannel (Writer, Adam) and James Wan (Writer, Director) did a wonderful job, writing a horror movie that wore their influences on their sleeve yet showed their own present imagination. This movie (for better or worse in your opinion dear reader) shows prescence from such movies as Se7en and Cube (both films I enjoy) Another aspect I enjoy about this, is the atmosphere for which this film represents. It has a dark, grim and gritty atmosphere. The great select of which the scenes were shot at alongside the haunting musical composing of Charlie C. really help add to the darkness of this film. Even though, the plot has been discussed and picked at over again, I will do the same.<br /><br />The film begins with Adam, laying in a bathtub full of water, as he begins to wake up, the water drains from the tub and he pulls himself out. Only to find he has been chained in a bathroom with another man (Dr. Lawrence) and a dead man with a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in another. So begins Saw. Throughout this film, we watch as Adam and Dr. Lawrence slowly stumble upon the sad truth as to watch has been done to them (and what could happen to them if they don't use their time wisely) and what could happen to their loved ones as well. As the story moves along Dr. Lawnrence is informed that his wife and child will be slain if he does not kill his new cellmate Adam. It is truly intense watching Dr. Lawrence slow spiral down the staircase of insanity as he finds of this outcome involving the murder of his wife and child. However, they do have help (unknowing to both sides) Detective David  Tapp (Danny Glover) has become obsessed with the Jigsaw case  and as time runs short for Adam and Lawrence, he quickly trys to come upon Jigsaw's new plan. However, we also see numerous flashback scenes involving Jigsaw's other \\"play things\\" Paul, Amanda and Mark. All whos outcome I will not spoil for you. In the end, it all comes down to one final gripping scene in which this all began. A dirty bathroom.<br /><br />This movie, means alot to me and is one of my all time favorites due to its message. It's one I think anybody could relate to. We're all human, we all have selfish moments in which we take for granted those we love, be it family, friends, signifigant other or whoever else. We all have extreme limits in which our body/mind will push ourselves to do extreme, violent and mind numbing acts to save ourselves and our loved ones. Many things in which we are rarely forced to do, due to the modern day society we live in. Jigsaw is a refreshing villian in a sense because he really isn't one. While obviously he is doing disturbing evil things, its not for the sake of doing disturing evil things. In fact their is a quote he made from Saw 2.<br /><br />\\"John: Seems to me that the knowledge of your sons impending death is causing you to act... Why is that we're only willing to do that, when a life is at stake?<br /><br />Eric Matthews: I've always loved my son, it has never changed<br /><br />John: No... no... It's changed now. You see, the knowledge of death... changes everything. If I were to tell you the exact date and time of your death... it would shatter everything.<br /><br />This sums up the Saw franchise very well. The knowledge of changeable pending death and our ability (or those which don't have it in some cases) to dig deep and do what has to be done to live another day. This is a unique and horror franchise and this is where it all started. Enjoy.o have help (unknowing to both sides) Detective David  Tapp (Danny Glover) has become obsessed with the Jigsaw case  and as time runs short for Adam and Lawrence, he quickly trys to come upon Jigsaw's new plan.

B0009S4IHY|5.0|I just really all around love this movie...I find myself going back to certain scenes. Like when the three unlikey kung-fu masters from pig sty alley save the day. That has got to be my favorite scene. Also the music adds so much to this movie, some of the action scenes would be nothing without it. All around if you like awesomely choreographed action scenes, humor, and a little bit of everyting....then you will definately love this movie, even the subtitles.
B000EULJLU|4.0|Tool's latest album, 10,000 Days is a typical, brilliant effort, like just about everything they do.  Tool are real pioneers in this field, a <br />Vicarious is an incredible song, arguably among the finest in this genre. <br />I wouldn't say there's a lotof new ground broken here, but it's still much more interesting and rich than most of the stuff out there.  This album is definitely not \\"fast-food music.\\"  Some of the songs are 10 minutes long, with many complex arrangements, and it takes a number of attentive listens to absorb.  Of particular note for me is the incredible drumming of Danny Carey, which is very tight and diverse, especially in some of the odd-meters he employs.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Seriously, folks, IMO this is THE funniest TV series of all time.  Brilliant scripting and acting.  Plot twists that combine hilarity with a tinge of Shakespearean tragedy (Mr. Fawlty's character flaws often lead him into the very trouble he is so desperately trying to avoid).  John Cleese is a comic genius, there is no other word for it.  This is a series that is most definitely worth owning and cherishing and re-watching every now and then.
B000004727|5.0|This album made me want to throw my guitars into the fireplace (and I'm not kidding).  La Barrossa has to be the finest guitar piece I've ever heard.  The word \\"genius\\" is often misused on those who really are not. Well...flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucia really is.  Aside from his rediculously flawless technique, his musical ideas, especially considering the times, are incredibly rich, complex, and just brilliant.  Granted, some of Paco's music goes right over my head, and can take a lifetime to disect.  This is not music for \\"flamenco purists.\\"  When anything in life runs its course, the universe has a way of shaking it up it (sometimes violently) to keep it in line with its ultimate destiny, neverending growth.  Paco de Lucia is that shakeup, and has given us a lifetime of inspiration. <br /> <br />My only quip with this album is the production style.  It's in the typical style of most modern flamenco records, drowning everything in reverb.  Just my personal preference, I'd prefer a bit more warmth and upfront presence. <br />   <br />I would also highly suggest his Luzia (1998) and Live in America (1993).
B000E1MTY0|5.0|This is an awesome HD movie! all I can say is if you have a HD player you have got to get this movie. If you don't you will do injustice to your player. If you do not have an HD player and know someone who does and they have this movie in HD ask them to let you watch it...you will be convinced and I can assure you that you will want to go out and purchase a HD player. Once you have watched a HD movie...you will not want to watch a standard DVD again. HD-DVD's is doing for the movies what HD has done for TV stations but much better! Now imagine that!
0805047905|1.0|The author/illustrator of this book has done quite a few other children's books, and my son of 3 years is actually afraid of the pictures in all of them.

B000GTJT0W|5.0|WOW! is how I want to start this review. This is an EXCELLENT HD-DVD. This is what HD is all about. The picture quality is superb and the sound is awesome. I own the standard version as well and now that I have the HD version....I have given the standard version away. Yes, it's that good! For those of you who have a HD player already get this movie and you will see what I'm talking about. Yes, the movie is great as well. It has lots of action and it's funny! For those of you who are on the \\"fence\\" about Blu-Ray and HD.....there is no doubt in my mind that HD will win this war. I have about 10 HD movies and they are all EXCELLENT! From what I have read the Blu-Ray movies are not nearly as good as HD. At this time HD is so far ahead that Blu-Ray will not catch up. Plus the titles on Blu-Ray SUCK! I cannot not imagine that Blu-Ray will look any better than HD. Also keep in mind that the only Blu-Ray player on the market is the one by Samsung(which from the reviews suck) Sony still has not launched it's player. Toshiba is now about to release it's second generation player in Dec-06.
B00005JPAD|5.0|You will hear many people being a little wishy-washy about Martin Scorsese while reviewing \\"The Departed\\". Numerous people after praising such recent efforts as \\"Gangs of New York\\" and \\"The Aviator\\" will now go on to say such things as `Scorsese is back' or `Scorsese's best film since' \\"Casino\\" or \\"GoodFellas\\". Are comments like these justified? Yes and no. \\"Gangs...\\" and \\"The Aviator\\" were good films, especially the latter, but they were not typical Scorsese fare and one couldn't help but wonder whether or not Scorsese had gone a little soft. On the other hand 1999's \\"Bringing Out the Dead\\" is easily the most underrated film of Scorsese's career, so his talents have not been as sorely missed as some may suggest. But all that aside, when watching \\"The Departed\\" one can not help but get a little worked up and excited by the fact that for this film Scorsese is doing what Scorsese does best: producing a violent, incredibly foul mouthed, fast paced, uber-masculine, religion shadowed, highly entertaining movie. In many ways, Scorsese is, in fact, back.<br /><br />I say that this kind of film is what Scorsese does best, but really the kind of film this is is a Scorsese film. He invented this particular style of storytelling and is still the only one who can truly pull it off. The film feels and acts like it's straight from the streets and holds nothing back in trying to seem so. The violence is realistic and blatant. The colourful language is appropriate. The characters, situations, locations all feel right, and all because Scorsese knows this material like he knows his own NY neighborhood. Of course it is ultimately a movie, and Scorsese uses his incredible skill as a director and his uncanny use of music and editing to achieve this effect, but with Scorsese, unlike those who imitate him, the whole fabrication of the film feels honest. Scorsese isn't trying to pull one over on us or pathetically trying to pass off content he knows nothing of through a fancy delivery; he's trying to allow us to share in an atmosphere and world he knows well enough to create a definite sense of within the framework of a motion picture. He's using the full cinematic language to create the tone of the material he is presenting, and it is his skill at achieving this `feel' of the film that is his true brilliance.<br /><br />And \\"The Departed\\" is one of his best. The story may take place in Boston rather than New York and the characters may be Irish rather than Italian, but Scorsese still manages to create a pitch perfect tone for the film. It even seems as though this change of scenery may have breathed new life into the man. The playfulness of his direction is refreshing and it adds great energy to the film. Scorsese's camera is never still and often noticeably cockeyed. He plays with the conventions of film, conventions he himself invented, holding shots a tad to long, taking angles that seem a tad off,  cutting with jittery editing, using odd effects such as the old school iris. The entire film is reminiscent of the last act of \\"GoodFellas\\", where the editing and cinematography become such an essential part of evoking the events on screen that they carry and drive the material. The content is exciting to be sure, but Scorsese's willingness to experiment and play with the form of the film is its greatest success.<br /><br />The material is certainly striking though. The story of police corruption and organized crime is excellent and the talent brought to the film by its incredible cast is remarkable. DiCaprio is skittish and compelling, Damon tough and commanding, and Nicholson, as always, outrageous and grand. Mark Wahlberg too is great in a small role, and manages to once again remind us that when not in Disney crap like \\"Invincible\\" he can be a first rate actor. Vera Farmiga is the only mentionable actress in the ensemble and is talented enough to be a notable feminine presence amongst all the testosterone being thrown around on screen. The film does well to balance action with character and it achieves a pace and tone succinct enough to carry its near three hour run time. Pace is essential to a film and with regards to it Scorsese is truly one of the masters. \\"The Departed\\" like most of his films is fast enough to generate interest but confident enough to sustain it. It would be so easy for a film like this to burn out half way through, but thanks to a plot that never drags and an energizing use of the medium the film never falters or missteps.<br /><br />\\"The Departed\\" is the best film of the year so far and not because it questions the nature of humanity or inspires us to seize the day or whatever. It is great because it is honest, enjoyable, never pretentious, and always invigorating. It reminds us why Scorsese is one of the all time greats and if an Oscar has been deserved in recent years for him than it is for this film above the others. It may not be as large in scale or budget, or as much of a stretch as recent material, but it is what Scorsese, and only Scorsese, does best.on with character and it achieves a pace and tone succinct enough to carry its near three hour run time.

B00068ULLY|4.0|By Tom-K ill Bill volumes 1 & 2 (Must See) <br /> \\"Kill Bill,\\" simply stunning and earth shattering in every imaginable way.  The music was the best and most fitting I have ever heard, the visual effects and camera shots were that of a science fiction film and art drama all rolled into one, and the acting and story were the best I've ever seen.   <br />  <br /> Though this movie was separated into two volumes, both are equally amazing and quality films.  You can't just watch one, because by the end of the first, you'll find yourself begging for the second.  And after the seeing the second movie, you'll find yourself begging for the third volume (If one will ever be made).  But I suppose that's how it is with nearly every movie  directed by Quentin Tarantino. <br /> <br /> I personally believe that this movie would be enjoyable for anyone, no matter their interests, so go buy it.   <br />
0618680004|4.0|I'm all for Dawkins against religious fundamentalism and bigotry, and on the perils of blind faith. I agree: we would be better off without organized,dogmatic religions that idolize books written thousand of years ago, books full of contradictions and errors. But religious sentiment is so deeply ingrained in human nature (as Dawkins himself admit) that eliminating it is pure utopia, as for now. And provided human and individual rights are respected and no law is violated, I find nothing wrong in religion per se. If I were Dawkins I would rather foster an humanistic religion, as Fromm had it, instead of berating agnostic scientists for not rejecting religion utterly (in short, for not agreeing fully with him). Moreover, and that surprises me, Dawkins cannot let go of his rivalry with the late, great Stephen Jay Gould, still arguing when poor Stephen can't even reply! How petty can you get?   In short, Man is a species  that creates Gods, is the image of God that we must refine to humanistic ethics.
068987474X|4.0|The sooner we can accept the truth in this book, the sooner we can be liberated from the brain fog caused by bad relationships everywhere. While Miranda Hobbes's epiphany through Jack Berger's sound advice during \\"Sex and the City\\" of, \\"sounds to me like he's just not that into you\\" seemed overly-simplistic, they truly have the right idea.  <br /> <br />When I first read this book after being dumped 2 years ago, I was SO disappointed. I expected to find closure. Understanding. The discovery of some big secret as to why men were the jerks I perceived (note the past-tense, people) them to be. Well, \\"He's just not that into you\\" isn't going to be so readily absorbed by many readers in part because it's just such common sense. After all, isn't is obvious that a man doesn't like you if he's not dating you? Isn't it obvious that a man doesn't like you if he doesn't call you or see you? Why yes. It is common sense. It is common sense that is, however, ignored all the time by people everywhere.  <br /> <br />While the book is explained primarily from a man's perspective, every female reader is quite grateful for the gray areas upon which Liz comments (\\"but what if he is just genuinely, truly too busy to call?\\"). She provides a voice to which every woman can identify. But, Greg's harsh logic provides one strong, accurate response to just about every scenario. He provides explanations when the man in a woman's life doesn't (\\"he will do everything possible to avoid confrontation because they hate seeing you cry\\"). He doesn't excuse their behavior, but he does make them a little easier to understand.  <br /> <br />The basic premise is as follows: in a woman's life, there will be men who are not going to reciprocate the same amount of time, love, and affection as she will give to him. Though she might be perfect TO him, she will never be perfect For him. The sooner this is accepted, the better. <br /> <br />The solution: brush him off, get up on your feet and find the man who will genuinely love and appreciate you (because he is out there, but if you settle for less by wasting your time on a man who doesn't care about you then you'll never find him).  <br /> <br />The sooner the reader absorbs the advice of these two witty authors, the sooner one can understand that \\"he's just not that into you.\\" Even better, that it's perfectly ok and to not take it personal. After all, \\"you're just not that into him, either.\\"  <br /> <br />
B000002U8G|5.0|When you think of a great work in all terms so this is the one. This album is perfect in contrasting the two sides(Vinyl talking), the environment of side one with the environment of other side in a totally balanced way.<br /><br />I agree with critics when they say this would be considered Pink Floyd \\"Magnum Opus\\" if \\"Dark side of the moon\\" hadn't appeared. I'm sure when you are a musician this is that kind of work you can spend all of your life searching for, and Floyd were searching by that time indeed. And why I afirm this, because this album is absolutely cohesive and convincing, it has a unique sounding, what is obvious in case of Pink Floyd work, they truly sounds different among all rock groups.<br /><br />Since the first notes of \\"One of these days\\" a group creation avant garde piece of music, it starts with two delayed basses lines with an echoe device after the wind blows suddenly, you'll never listen to something like this anymore in your life, very creative and inventive. The second part of this finishes with slide guitar from Gilmour and more wind blowing, superb.<br /><br />In my opinion the most intelligent love song ever composed is \\"A pillow of winds\\", what a superb piece of music, man, it's perfect, really, it's a portrait of mutual contribution between Roger Waters and David Gilmour, Waters wrote the lyrics and Gilmour the music, the lyrics are a description of a moment in life when you are just resting calmly, with your love by your side and she is breathing low, Waters write with genius:- \\"And deep beneath the ground the early morning sounds, and I go down, sleeping time when I lie, with my love by my side, and she is breathing low, And I rise like a bird in the haze when the first rays touch the sky, and the night winds die\\"-. This lyrics shows the absolute lyrical genius Waters is, it's suppose to be a love song but he transformed it into a deep philosophical moment with deep meanings, all love songs should be like this one, the music is gentle with Gilmour and Waters playing acoustic guitars in a gentle way, and very well played, wow.<br /><br />The third song is the best one of first side, \\"Fearless\\", one more superb Waters/Gilmour compositional contribution, an acoustic guitar riff, immediately captivating, with genius lyrics,- \\"You say the hill is too steep to climb\\"-, Waters point of view that you can get your life on your hands when you decide to, is portraited in this song, in the beguinning he starts with indecision, but at the end of the song he decides and made it happen,- \\"No doubt in your own way, and every day is the right day, and as you rise above the fear-lines in his brow, you look down hear the sound of the faces in the crowd\\"-.<br /><br />The next song is the jazzy \\"San Tropez\\" very good sound a kind of relaxing song, the side one ends with an idea copied all around the world, put a dog as vocalist of a song, very brave of them, this demonstrated as they have never really wanted to be a commercial band, in anyway.<br /><br />The B side has one of the greatest pieces of music ever composed by any popular band in the world, \\"Echoes\\". Critics like to describe this music as a cathedral of sounds that starts from the ground to the top of the main tower beeing constructed gradually in a perfect and intricate way, from the beguinning to the end without any weak part in it. The first sounds you can discern are like sonar sounds played by Rick Wright on piano, after that starts a gentle guitar and carefully played drums, it's like an introduction, a preparation in a classical music terms, Waters enters with bass playing and just after starts singing a double tracking vocals with Gilmour/Wright working very well done.<br /><br />The melody is gentle and beautiful, Gilmour's guitar playing as he himself said is in the right place, he found his own style in this album. The middle section it's an exploration experimentation of sound effects in my opinion the most effective ever made. Floyd is themost gifted group in terms of sound effects creation, they have never made useless effects, they've always used the exact amount, but on this album the effects like whales crying in a deep and distant cold ocean is simply superb there's no other word to describe it, following section is a instrumental section, the best one of all Floyd's carreer.<br /><br />Group sounds like an orchestra, Gilmour describes with his own words, \\"At the end of echoes is this kind of guitar orchestra going on... I still think this is wonderful.\\" If the creator said that what else would I say.<br /><br />They finished this absolute masterpiece of music with total symmetry, after the climax they made the coda movement like in a classical music piece, they recover the vocal part and walk to the end concluding with sonar Wright's piano and the sound of million human voices ressounding from the deep of the soul.<br /><br />If you are a music lover and have never listened this superb work of art, you will discover that this is that kind of thing that transform your conception of life in a totally different one perspective, and on an irreversible way.<br /><br />You will never be the same after this listening. Buy this album and remenber what I told you. In this album mainly on \\"Echoes\\" Pink Floyd sounds so cohesive that they seems like a classical orchestra, it's sometimes difficult to believe that there was only four musicians playing. Buy it as fast as you can.<br /><br />Five stars is not enough for this album. I agree with the score given by one \\"KID-reviwer\\", that made a review as good as any adult would make, below, but only disagree with the score 9/10 to \\"A Pillow of Winds\\", as time goes by and you listen to this song several times, it increases more and more in perfection untill you recognize that this song is a masterpiece, so to me \\"A Pillow of Winds\\" is a 10/10 song, indeed.
6304698623|5.0|I read the book when I was a little girl and was enraptured with the world of both Sara Crewe and the stories she would tell of far-away lands and princesses. As always, I heed great caution in books-turned-movie, but in this case it's not needed-- the movie is, I dare say, better than the book.     The first thing that draws the attention of the viewer is the use of color-- vibrant hues engulf the screen and one remembers (if only for a few seconds) what their childhood imagination was like so many years ago. For children who are seeing the movie, the lens of the camera mirrors that of a child's: brilliant and luminous. In fact, the color and lighting throughout the movie is one way this film retains its magic over the years. When seeing the lighting and colors for the film 'Harry Potter III' it's not surprising that the two films have the same great director.     As for the score of the film, the exotic music provides a great juxtaposition to the traditional and sometimes harsh background of England circa 1900's. India's culture is portrayed with its best foot forward (which considering Britain's imperialist attitude towards the nation at the time, isn't such a bad lesson for kids in multiculturalism and diversity).    Both the music and colors of the film make it a good addition to the already-strong theme of the book, which is also enhanced in the movie.    As for the theme, every little kid should heed the lesson of this movie well. While Millennials were raised with the assumption that they are indeed special snowflakes, this book reinforces the notion in beautiful, rich cinematography. All girls are, after all, a little princess.     Aside from promoting self-esteem and individuality, the movie also encourages tolerance, questioning authority, loving one's parents, following your heart, determination, and standing up for your beliefs.     The premise of the movie is simple enough: a young, affluent British girl raised in India is sent to boarding school. Though at odds with the strict, embittered headmistress, she makes friends with the other pupils through telling her elaborate fairy tails. Her life changes immediately when her father, still in India, is injured and presumed dead. Immediately impoverished, Sara must face her new fate as a child servant to the boarding school. It's only when she meets, unexpectedly, an old family friend that she pieces her life back together. Though the movie ends with a more Spielberg-esque ending than the book, the conclusion still left me in tears.    I couldn't praise this movie any higher. Though I'm a 20-something college student, I would recommend this movie for people of all ages since the story is just so beautifully told in this film.
0060934913|4.0|Kitchen Confidential is a memoir of Anthony Bourdain's experiences in his career as a chef and his climb to the top.  The book is written in a very street type of a language so it flows as if you are listening to him tell his story rather then reading an authors words.  His stories are a bit brash and he writes using a lot of curse words but he is a man of the people and writes  using the peoples language.  He really conveys throughout his writings that cooking at his level is not an art, its a craft.  Just like a carpenter can build a house he can build a meal.  His crafts were honed through repetition and apprentiship.  I would reccomend this book to anyone interested in cooking, eating or just reading an interesting story based on a cooking celebrities life.
0743454537|4.0|When looking for something to do on my Sunday evening, I decided to graze Target's book section. My expectations of finding a good book, though, were admittedly low. Thoroughly unimpressed after wading through the seemingly unending chick literature choices, I saw \\"My Sister's Keeper.\\" I expected the piece of fiction to be about yet another troubled teen, wrought with angst of an eating disorder or drug addiction. Thankfully, I was wrong.  <br /> <br />The first captivating thing about Picoult is her sophisticated, yet simple writing style despite the diversity of characters she narrates, all from a first-person perspective. Perhaps it's because of her sophisticated style that one flaw I noticed was that Anna's character was slightly unbelievable due to her incredible maturity for being only 13 years old.  Regardless, the author breaks down each character into one with which the reader can empathize. Due to the controversial nature of the issues plaguing the family (stem-cell research, designer babies, leukemia), to truly engage the reader the author recognizes the need to portray each angle through the voices of the people in the story. <br /> <br />Sara (the mother): if there is an antagonist in the story, the mother might be the closest. As if compensating for not becoming (conventionally) successful like her sister, Sara places great emphasis on being a good mother. The problem every character notices is to whom Sara is a good mother--there's her oldest son, Jesse, who becomes a nonchalant delinquent, the middle daughter, Kate, dying of leukemia, and her youngest, Anna, who feels like a neglected guinea pig for her sick sister. Sara's attention throughout the book is placed almost entirely on Kate, giving only an afterthought to her other children. Because of her cavalier attitude of saving Kate, Sara actually hurts her family in the process through neglect. Though maternal instinct drives a mother to protect her child at any cost, I'm not so sure any mother would do it with the same degree of recklessness and in a way, selfishness. Sara's greatest downfall is her self-pity disguised as motherly altruism.  <br /> <br />Brian (the father): This character is a nice guy, but easily the most boring. Having no distinct voice (except some thrown-together astronomy analogies to interpret life and something about firefighting), Brian muddles through the story somewhat aimlessly. While yes, we all know there are no black and white answers to who is right or wrong, his character waffles to the point of being inconsequential to the storyline. His role as a yes-man husband doesn't help his case. A backbone or personality would greatly assist the plot. <br /> <br />Jesse (the son): What I liked most about Jesse was that his actions were never with bad intentions despite being a skilled arson and occasional drunk or pothead. Though clearly due to lack of self-esteem, his honesty with life and himself is refreshing to read when everyone else seems so confused and lost. Despite having such a different attitude and vernacular from the other characters, the author does a great job incorporating wit into Jesse's bitter outlook. At no point is Jesse afraid to admit his frustration at being left behind throughout his life.    <br /> <br />Kate: despite the story revolving around her, she is only given one chance to express her voice which doesn't come until the end of the story. I found this unfortunate since I would've appreciated her point of view. I debated the author's intent in excluding sections of Kate's point of view: is it because cancer victim narratives are already so common? Is it to give voice to those often overshadowed by the person suffering from leukemia? While I'm not sure of the answer, I don't think a small narrative throughout the book would've detracted from the meaning.  <br /> <br />Campbell: I don't think mentioning his own medical malaise was a good development for the story, though like many readers, I did enjoy reading his quips to others about his dog. While his point of view as an attorney contributed to the well-roundedness of the book, his relationship with the guardian, Julia, is also unnecessary. The time spent developing a rather contrived love story could've been used to enhance the other deeper concepts of the book.  <br /> <br />Julia: An entirely forgettable character. Sure, she's a sophisticated ex-rebel who was anti-establishment in high school. How or why that matters to the plot is unknown to me. Even during the trial she fails to do her only job: give an opinion about what should be done regarding Anna's medical autonomy. Though her character supplements Campbell, it supplements what I already deemed as superfluous in context of the overarching theme.  <br /> <br />Anna: As mentioned previously, her great maturity and wisdom is questionable. Nonetheless, she is portrayed with such a voice that remains with the reader after the book is finished.  <br /> <br />The ending is unexpected irony that asks the reader many weighted questions: how discriminatory is death? Can or should one life be valued over another? Does science provide health equality or further the gap between the haves and have-nots? How much control can or should people exert over their own health? How about over the health of others? Do courts have a right to dictate these decisions? Should such decisions be left to the courts, hospitals, parents, or a mix?  <br /> <br />By no means does the book answer any of the above, but at least it elicits thought from not just those in the seats of government, but those who shop at Targets everywhere.  <br />
B00005JPBP|4.0|Christopher Nolan has expertise making movies with narratives that aren't straightforward.  (If you have not, you really should see \\"Memento\\" which is told in five minute chunks - arranged in reverse order.)  In \\"The Prestige\\" he takes a first-rate cast and a lurid magic-noir story and ends with a result that had my family talking for an hour afterward.  Do I recommend it? Yes.  Is it perfect? No.  There are plot twists aplenty. Not all of them are as surprising as the film wants them to be.  (Did you guess the \\"secret\\" of \\"The Sixth Sense\\"? Me neither.  At least one of the major \\"secrets\\" of this film lumbers along in front of your eyes for half the film, and when it is revealed I didn't get that sense of being deliciously tricked that I got from Sixth Sense.) The final \\"secret\\" required a little more suspension of disbelief than I was willing to give as a character-drive period drama ends with a science fiction device as unbelievable as time-travel.  It was a good plot device - for a different story.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman joins actors who have worked with Mr. Nolan before: Michael Caine and Christian Bale.  Hugh plays Angier while Bale plays Borden - rivals who escalate their professional rivalry into a deadly game of one-upmanship. Michael Caine's character builds the elaborate magical devices used onstage.  He serves as both supporting character and a one-man Greek Chorus of sorts as he introduces elements of the story. The non-linear narrative covers three distinct time periods.  In the earliest time period Angier and Borden are assistants to a magician who has great illusory skills, but not much showmanship.  In this period Piper Perabo is Mrs. Angier - the lovely female assistant to the older plodding magician.  Something happens to Piper that ratchets up the rivalry between the younger magicians to matching deadly obsessions.  In the \\"middle\\" timeline Angier leaves Victorian London to visit the mysterious Nikola Tesla and his electric laboratory in the snow-capped mountains of Colorado Springs.  Tesla is played by David Bowie in a surprisingly effective performance. Andy Sirkis steps out of the role of Gollum to finally arrive on-screen with his face shown.  The Colorado sequences are effective with the snow-covered setting and Bowie's performance - portraying Tesla as half mad-scientist, half philosophical sage.  Angier commissions Tesla to build the \\"ultimate\\" magic trick.

I'm 60+ and don't consider myself a rocker or an audiophile, but I like good music, I've still got the vynyl on this ALB. Fleetwood Mac enthuiasts will appreciate the radical vs soothing sounds on this CD.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|This is a criminally underrated show, and in my opinion, the best show on the CW. While at first glance it may seem to be your average sci-fi show with two hot guys killing stuff and road-tripping across the States, anyone who has seen more than a couple episodes will realize that the heart and soul of the show is family. Sam and Dean Winchester are two of the most compelling characters television has to offer, and the psychological depth the actors bring to these characters is the real treasure of this show. Jensen Ackles especially gives a performance to be remembered and puts him in league with the most talented young actors in Hollywood. Why he hasn't gotten more recognition for this is beyond me. Supernatural is a deft blend of action, horror, and humor, centered and grounded by the ever-evolving relationship between Sam and Dean. A must-see.
1400043662|5.0|I am a huge HM fan, I've always considered the man a genius, and definitely one of the greatest writers of our time. On \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" Murakami re-invents himself, writing a book that is very bold, original and unexpected. This is one of those books you cannot put away untill you finish it. And even afer you're finished reading \\"Kafka\\", you'll think about it quite a lot, and will be eager to talk with other people who've rear the book, about it. Why? Because HM decides to end this book in a way where most of the questions remain unanswered! He leaves it to the reader's own imagination to answer many questions...<br /><br />As usuall, Murakami creates great and lovavle characters, people who are unique and you can indentify with. Unlike many think, Kafka is NOT the only hero of this book. There are 2 other ones, and they are the ones you'll fall in love with - the unfogettable Mr. Nakata (a unique old man, who is simple minded because of an even that occured in his childhood) and his new-found friend Hoshino (a young truck-driver, with a troubled past, who discoveres himself through his trip with Nakata). A few other characters appear all through the book as well. The plot is captivating, it envolves so many elements of fiction, reality, spirituality, love, romance. and more... You'd think that noone is capable of putting all those elemnts together into one book, but apparantly Murakami IS. This is a story about growing up and descovering yourself. This is a story about love and passion, that cannot excist unfortunately. It's a book about sadness, and loneliness. About escaping... A book about dreams.. About friendship... About loyalty and true belief... You can add on to this list... Haruki Murakami is one of this age's greatest and most original writers (yes, I am saying it again!), and he proved it once again on his boldest book. You won't be able to put this book down, and even though you might end up being confused at the end (actually you WILL end up being confused), it doesn't take a think away from the book!

B000002KBU|5.0|Every once in a great while, an artist nails it.  They're able to put together a piece of work that not only stands as their personal best, but somehow transcends even the question of \\"how good is it?\\".  Neil Young achieved such perfection with 'Rust Never Sleeps'.  Dave Mason did it with 'Alone Together', and Carole King with 'Tapestry'.  On Joni Mitchell's 'Blue', all the stars aligned in 1971, and a masterpiece was given birth.  On streatches of 'Blue', Joni lays out life in it's simplest and most minimal forms, yet punctuates the clarity with moments of confusion, doubt, dismay, lonliness, and disillusion.  In this, 'Blue' mimics life in all its authenticity.  Accessible to the empath, the work allows the listener to glare into the joys and troubles in the heart and mind of the artist, lending a sense of connectivity seldom achieved through any manner of artistic expression.    'Blue' was released in 1971 as Joni's fifth album, and along with 'For the Roses' represents something of a transition for her, from traditional folk and hippie stylings to shades of jazz and blues, leading to her more commercial work on 'Court and Spark'.  Nevertheless, at this point in her career, Joni still prefered the simplicity of piano, guitar, and other acoustic stringed instruments such as the dulcimer.  She also confined her backing musicians to a small cadre of expert session men (Sneeky Pete Kleinow from The Flying Burrito Brothers and drummer Russ Kunkel), and personal friends with marquee names (Stephen Stills and James Taylor).  But for the most part, 'Blue' is a solo effort by Joni, and rightfully so given the transparency and intimacy each of her compositions lends to the listener.    There isn't a song on 'Blue' that cannot be appreciated for some aspect of its production.  Joni's lyrical prowess is churning away full throttle from the outset, with streams of consciousness such as \\"Oh, I hate you some, I hate you some, I love you some, Oh, I love you when I forget aboutme\\" somehow touching a chord we've all experienced on 'All I Want'.  In the same song we have \\"I want to talk to you, I want to shampoo you\\"!!  Where does that come from and what is it doing in a song?  Fortunate for Joni, it's utterly delightful!  Her liberal leanings, surely at home in the ears of her youthful 1960's audience, are on display in the chorus from 'My Old Man': \\"We don't need no piece of paper from city hall, keeping us tied and true\\", perhaps reflecting but also vocalizing what many were thinking in that decade of liberation.  And what artist could get away with a line like \\"Little green, he's a non-conformer\\", and making it come across as a completely natural thing to say?  Many of the songs seem to give us glimpses of Joni's own love life, couched in intricate yet catchy melodies, songs such as 'Carey' (containing the delightful line \\"Oh you're a mean old Daddy but you're out of sight\\"), 'River' (containing the sensual \\"Lord, he loved me so naughty, made me weak in the knees\\"), which also plays curiously on a Christmas melody, 'A Case of You' (comparing her lover to a case of vintage wine, she somehow conjures up \\"Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine\\"), as well as an encounter with a past confidant in 'The Last Time I Saw Richard' (\\"You like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you all those pretty lies, pretty lies.  Only pretty lies, pretty lies\\").  There is even a love song to Mother Earth in 'California', one of the best known tracks from the disc.  The six pages of printed lyrics in the booklet read more like classic poetry than anything else.    'Blue' may well be Joni Mitchell's Mona Lisa.  It is captivating in its catharsis, enveloping in its emoting, and revelatory in its poignance.  The word 'blue' is not only the title, but can be found in five of the first six songs (save 'Carey') making it a fitting color and title for the disc, which has a distinctly blue, meloncholy feel.  The disc has not been remastered, but the vibrant sounddismisses any notions that it needs to be... although who would argue with the addition of some alternate takes or editing room tracks originally ferreted out should the disc be reissued?  Save yourself some change and fish out a brand new copy at Your Music dot com, where a new copy can be had for six bucks (shipping included) and your signiture on the dotted line.  So much choice art for the moolah may not be had elsewhere.

Took me a bit of time to get into the first book - but once the plot started to roll, it was really good. These books are well written - yet 'pulpy' enough to be a guilty little pleasure.

0375420525|5.0|Okay, okay. I get it. Do you enjoy finishing a book in an afternoon? Do you like to let the words in a book speak for themselves? Then this isn't a book for you. It is a challenge to read; one in particular was painfully complex, I'll admit that. But I liked the work as a whole very, very much. It does take interpretation beyond just READING the words on the page. This is very much a book that you could study and dissect in an English class. Again, if that isn't you're bag, don't buy it. It's also more than a little pretentious but seeing as most of it is in the form of a pseudo-academic criticism (almost to the point of parody), I think that it's understandable. So if you hate academic writing, even if it's about a house that violates the laws of physics, don't buy the book! <br />People say that this is a tale of horror and they couldn't sleep at night because of it. I've also heard someone say that it \\"ruins your life\\". Personally, I didn't find it very scary. Suspenseful, you bet. If you are expecting terror, you won't get it. This book made me think and that's why I like it so much.

B000E97HIA|2.0|More than one time I said to myself: That's it, Prince! I've had enough of your songs! But then again, I've paid the price just to see if I could discover another of his \\"pearls\\". And that's the case with \\"The Dance\\", the only one where apparently he's followed his instincts. As for the rest... Well, another composer trying to please the majority with his \\"easy hits\\".
B000E6ESL2|4.0|Why was this film so widely panned in the U.S.  It is NOT incomprehensible, nor poorly acted or filmed.  My guess is that the temple dogs of media neither \\"get\\" or allow material that challenges the ego mind or the consensual model of reality, unless it's marketed as hokum or horror. <br /> <br />Folks who get A Course in Miracles or any other spiritual map which exposes the illusions of the ego-mind-body time space trap will both enjoy and understand this subtle outing about a mind in crisis and another mind joining his in order to come to a higher understanding of being. <br /> <br />MacGregor, Gosling and Watts are affecting.  The Asche and Spence score is not much different than their sonics for \\"Monster's Ball\\"... effective, but not memorable.  I'll be glad when films get off this whole ambient schtick. I like the old thrillers and dramas with melodic background a la Herrmann and Donaggio.  I suppose it's always in cycles. <br /> <br />
B000HT386M|3.0|Oh, it's good natured fun, but if you're looking for something more, beware.<br /><br />CLICK is about a businessman named Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) who has his priorities a little out of order. Too often, work comes before anything else in his life. So, stressed out and faced with 8 or 9 remote controls in his living room, he makes a trip to Bed, Bath & Beyond (a product placement that probably paid for the entire shoot) for a univeral remote. There, he meets up with Morty (Christopher Walken) in the Beyond section, who gives him more than he bargained for... a remote control that will change his life.<br /><br />That's where the movie sort of moves into the realm of silliness. With the remote, he can fast forward life, skip unpleasant things, pause to think about things, put things in slow motion etc. Many of the antics are very funny, and some are questionable... why would anybody fast forward through sex with Kate Beckinsale???<br /><br />Where IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE had a wholesome quality to it, CLICK loses its wholesomeness in many Sandlerish sequences... like the slow motion jogger with the bouncing assets, or the depantsing, or the nut-kicking etc. At times, the remote control theme gets a little ridiculous.<br /><br />But then... the movie turns a corner into the redeemable. The movie finishes with some emotional moments that effectively tug the heartstrings and give the movie weight.<br /><br />Ultimately, CLICK is a good movie. Some jokes work. Some don't. So, like I said, as long as you're not looking for something as unforgettable, timeless and world changing as IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE was, then CLICK may not disappoint you, because it isn't unforgettable, timeless or world changing. It's just a movie, and a movie we'll probably forget after a couple of months.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|Whether you like it or not, Avenged Sevenfold have become a force to be reckoned with. You could liken their popularity to that of Metallica in the late 80's/early 90's. Sure, there have been plenty of popular metal bands, but Avenged Sevenfold seem to have struck a chord with both the metal audience as well as the punk, mainstream and even pop audience, all at once. \\"City Of Evil,\\" the band's third album, despite it's shortcomings, is actually quite a refreshing and just plain fun album.<br /><br />Sounds Like: Someone wants to be the Guns N' Roses for the Warped Tour generation.<br /><br />The Good:<br />- Avenged Sevenfold bring to the table both solid musicianship and a frontman that stands out from the pack.<br />- The production is crisp, clean and pure.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />- \\"City Of Evil\\" marks a change in pace for the band, and a cynic could say it was made to play on the radio.<br />- The album gets a little tiresome in the middle; not enough variety.<br />- The band's image is both ridiculous and contrived.<br /><br />Hits: The heavier and faster \\"Beast And The Harlot,\\" \\"Burn It Down, \\"Blinded In Chains\\" sit well with the softer material such as \\"Seize The Day,\\" \\"Strength Of The World\\" and \\"M.I.A.\\"<br /><br />Misses: It may work for some, but \\"Bat Country\\" never fails to annoy me.<br /><br />Future: Avenged Sevenfold may have the largest group of haters this side of Limp Bizkit, but they have the goods to back it up. And unlike most of their peers, they can turn their musical prowess into good songs, as opposed to just ear-candy. I get the feeling the next album will blow everyone away and should gain them the respect they deserve.<br /><br />Personally: I wanted to hate this band just as much as the next guy, but one listen won me over. Avenged Sevenfold are unfairly criticized at times and they deserve to be taken a little more seriously. Perhaps ditching their goofy, re-heated Motley Crue-esque look would do them some good.<br /><br />Best Listened To When: You have an open mind.
0393061434|4.0|Though iWoz credits Gina Smith as a co-author, it reads as though penned by Woz alone - and everyone knows that engineers aren't the strongest writers.  Though I risk ratings decimation, I must acknowledge the general butchery of the English language exhibited in the book.  That said, however, I don't believe that the text was overly damaged by this shortcoming - my belief is that most readers of a book like iWoz will be less concerned with clear prose, and more with what Woz has to actually say.<br /><br />Because of that fact, I'll strongly recommend the book - there won't be many \\"casual\\" readers coming to read Steve Wozniak's story.  The primary strength of the book is in its insight into Woz's character - by the end, I really do feel as though I know the guy.  Additionally, we get a good glimpse into the technical mindset of the engineer, as well as the chance to revisit the invention of some world-changing technology.<br /><br />However, historical and technical nuggets aside, iWoz is a book only someone who loves Woz (like I do) could love.  The hacked up prose, persistent soapboxing, and regular declarations of humility (while telling us how great he was at x, y, and z) make for a text most would find tedious.  I appreciated the book because it allowed me to experience a hero of mine in an intimate and human way.  Woz enthusiasts should run out and grab this book - casually interested readers might not be so satisfied.

B000056OBA|3.0|Beethoven's 5th by Karajan was my first classical record purchase.  Thousands of analogue and digital discs later, I again purchased the same 5th and eight others on this CD set.    Karajan lived through the eternal dilemma of the all artists who came after the great predecessors.  At his last Saltsburg Festival, after conducted \\"Don Giovanni\\"He said to his wife,    \\"Furtwangler would have said it wasn't all that great.\\"  She consoled the Maestro,  \\"It was! It was!\\"  Karajan had a life long struggle with legacy of Furtwangler and was not too sure if he won.    Well, his style and interpretations are definitely non-Furtwangler, or to more precisely put non-German.  It seems to me that Karajan tried to avoid playing Beethoven's music in conjunction with German culture and spirituality.    Whether his attempt was successful one or not, has been a topic of many music critics and connoisseurs.    Personally, I have a mixed feeling toward this cycle.  I like No.1, 2 and 7 very much. However, there are some flaws; for instance in the fourth movements of 5th and 9th,  cello, bass, tympani and all lower notes suddenly disappear. All you hear is the first violin all the way to coda with painfully  bright tone.(This is more obvious if you own high resolution Audiophile stereo system)    Wonder if this deletion of bass is a part of Karajan's interpretations or a fault of old analog recorder, which is incapable of  recording loud passages?    In each symphonies, the first violin is always exaggerated over other instruments. I think that is the reason why some people  call these recordings \\"light\\" Beethoven.    If you must listen to Karajan's Beethoven Symphonies, I would recommend SACD reissue, which is more expensive and bass is  still thin but tonal quality is somewhat more acceptable.    And if you want to listen to the best Beethoven cycle, do yourself a favor:  Obtain the 9 symphonies by Furtwangler.    This set is not my first choice.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|... but something was keeping me from doing so. I'm not really sure what, but it feels like something is missing from this album.  <br /> <br />It's not that DCfC sold out, because I honestly don't see much of a change in their music, other than the fact that it's a little less raw. I think the only thing keeping me from giving this cd 5 stars is the actual song quality. <br /> <br />Just because they've stayed true to their indie-label roots doesn't mean every song's got the quality that their old ones had. There are a couple songs on this cd that I think are filler-- \\"Someday You Will Be Loved\\" and \\"Your Heart Is An Empty Room\\", to be exact. \\"Someday...\\" is about as repetitive as it gets. Also, I thought \\"Stable Song\\" could've been left off the album... but that's just me. <br /> <br />The good songs on this album are VERY good... my favorite is \\"I Will Follow You Into The Dark\\". The mediocre songs? Well, they're REALLY mediocre. <br /> <br />I would recommend getting Transatlanticism instead, and just downloading some of the highlights from this cd off of iTunes or something.
B00005JPBP|5.0|This is the third film to be released in 2006 that deals with magicians and the second of the three to take place in Europe at the turn of the 20th century.  It is also the second to star Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson.  However, each film has been unique and this one is probably the best of the three (The Illusionist is a close second and Scoop is a distant third). <br />Telling the story of two rival magicians over the course of a few years (starting somewhere in the 1890s and ending around 1900), The Prestige is a great story of love, revenge, duality, and mystery. <br />Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) start out as assistants to a fairly prominent magician.  They are \\"plants\\"; they pretend to be audience members brought on stage to assist with a trick.  Known as the Water Escape, the magician's female assistant, who is also Angier's wife, is bound and lowered into a tank of water only to escape within seconds.  However, when Borden alters the knot he ties to make it look harder to untie, he inadvertantly causes her to drown.  This starts a bitter rivalry between Angier and Borden; they each strive to become famous magicians and outdo the other.  Angier disrupts one of Borden's shows, so Borden in turn does the same.  As the story continues, Angier hires Harry Cutter (Michael Caine), a man whose profession is to build the devices magician's use for their illusions, and Olivia Wenscombe (Johannson) to be his new assistant.  Meanwhile, Borden tends to perform shows by himself.  We soon learn that while Borden is definitely the better magician (he can instantly spot how his colleagues perform even the most baffling illusions), he is a terrible showman.  Even though his act is comprised of great illusions, he cannot keep the audience interested.  Angier on the other hand is a wonderful performer; he knows how to engage the audience and build up tricks.  However, he is nowhere near the magician that Borden is.  Despite Angier's self-realized inferiority, the rivalry continues to heat up, and despite the warnings of Cutter, Olivia, and even scientist Nichola Tesla (David Bowie) of what an obsession can do to a man, they each try to continually outdo the other. <br />The story is not told linearly.  It starts out near the end with Borden being arrested, and most of the movie is a flashback due to Borden reading Angier's diary in prison.  However, there are plenty of flashbacks within the flashback, as there are scenes where Angier is describing in his diary of reading Borden's diary.  Though this may sound confusing, it is actually fairly easy to keep track of where scenes fall in continuity.  Directory Christopher Nolan, who also did the amazing Memento and Batman Begins, is a master of non-linear story-telling, and this film is no exception. <br />The central mysteries of the film are very well-done; they are interesting and have good payoffs, but the best part about them is that there are enough clues for them to be figured out.  They are not easy to figure out, but keen observers may be able to piece certain things together to find the answers (I was able to put most of the stuff together, but I did miss one or two details).  This doesn't take away from the film at all, in fact it enhances it and makes it fun to try and see where things are going. <br />Everything about The Prestige is well done, from the acting to the effects to the writing.  There's a reason why it was the number 1 film at the box office after its first weekend, so make sure you don't miss this.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|The dulcet and eloquent articulation by Hugo Weaving playing futuristic revolutionary known as V belies the powerful message of the film.  Director James McTeigue working with a script provided by the Wachowski brothers and based of the novel by Alan Moore creates a socially critical film in the mode of the classic story \\"1984\\".<br /><br />In the year 2020 worldwide conflicts have fueled the creation of a totalitarian society in England led by the unyielding, dictatorial Chancellor Adam Sutler played powerfully by the accomplished John Hurt.  Having quashed the ideals of intellectuals, citizens live under fear of reprisal for wrong thinking.  Under these repressive conditons arises V, a lone voice attempting by terroristic acts to alter the shape of society.<br /><br />During one of V's escapades, he comes into contact with working girl Evey Hammond played by Natalie Portman.  She comes to his aid as he attempts to take control of the government run television station where she works.  They form an uneasy bond at first and V takes Evey in his confidence.  We learn that both Weaving and Portman are products of their society.  V was a survivor of a government sponored experiment into biologic warfare.  Portman survived the destruction of her family at the hands of an unsympathetic government.<br /><br />V who stealthily gets around in swashbuckling fashion cloaked with a Guy Fawkes mask throughout the film, has designs to make a stupendous terroristic statement on Guy Fawkes Day, November 5th.  He schools Evey in his philosophy and together they work towards making major changes into societal structure.<br /><br />The special effects and visual imagery were prodigious and the stunt work was also first rate.  Weaving, Portman and Hurt were all impressive in their portrayals.  Despite the cartoonish nature of the film, it did provide relevant critiques into authoritarian societies which deny its members a freedom of choice.
B000FFJ82Q|1.0|The first time I saw this movie, I didn't like it. When I saw it again on cable TV, I still didn't like it. Since it first came out, it's earned its place at the top of my most-hated-movies list. But to an extent, I did understand why so many were taken in by ID4 when it first showed in 1996. The special effects were unquestionably spectacular. Unfortunately, that was all it had going for it. Right off, I saw that the producers were out to make a quick buck without actually thinking about such basic things as good storytelling, decent acting, character depth, and credible dialogue. They didn't care that their so-called story had plot holes the size of lunar craters. They didn't care that their so-called script was riddled with moronic dialogue and annoying, unfunny jokes that kept repeating. They didn't care about anything, except the special effects, and the profits. <br /> <br />And now, this. A tenth anniversary edition that only serves as a numbing reminder to the thinking moviegoer that the same people who made this one of the most commercially successful movies ever still think it's a great piece of filmmaking. I for one thought, and hoped, that people would soon enough wise up to the fact that ID4 is a huge dud. I actually hoped they would realize that after the novelty of the special effects has worn off, what you're left with is garbage. I really believed that after being exposed to the likes of The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, films which combined terrific special effects with good storytelling, they would see ID4 for what it really is: an enormous pile of dung. <br /> <br />Sadly, I was mistaken. Emmerich and Devlin are still making big bucks out of this singularly awful attempt at filmmaking. And what I find particularly disturbing is, the fan base for this movie has apparently not only remained loyal, it actually seems to have increased in number. <br /> <br />Know this, I have nothing against mindless fun. I am fully capable of appreciating a movie that allows me to leave my brain at the door and just sit back and enjoy. But see, mindless and stupid are two different things. Even the Abrahams brothers, who gave us no-brain belly laughs with the likes of Top Secret, Airplane and Naked Gun, should be credited for thinking up all those gags. And mind you, that takes a lot of imagination. Emmerich and Devlin, on the other hand, clearly made no such effort. And therein lies the difference between mindless and stupid. The mindless enjoyment should be on the part of the viewer. The producers still have a responsibility to think through their story. When they fail in that responsibility, what they come up with, more often than not, is stupid filmmaking. <br /> <br />I remember a behind-the-scenes featurette wherein Emmerich, in an interview, said, \\"I don't care about critical acclaim. I just want to have fun.\\" Fine, who doesn't want to have fun at his job? But if his idea of fun is inflicting stupid films like ID4 on the movie going public, well, that's something I simply can't endorse. <br /> <br />Of course, there are strong indications that a lot of people have no problem at all with this type of attitude. To these people, I say go ahead and buy your copy of this tenth anniversary DVD release. Just be aware that you are contributing to the bank account of someone who didn't care about quality filmmaking, and just wanted to have fun. And know that he's succeeding at your expense.

B000HT386M|4.0|Click pulls off the dramedy genre quite well. The first half of the film introduces the viewer to a typical working parent who is dealing with the stresses and frustration inherent to balancing work and family. Michael Newman (Sandler) is dedicated to creating a (materially) better life for his wife and two children. When he is provided with the seeming solution to much of his frustration with his family's lack of understanding about his goals in the form of a universal remote control which controls his universe, he uses it in the same way that many of us would. As he entertains himself by pausing, muting and rewinding various situations, and fast-forwarding through or skipping over entirely the tedious, it's highly entertaining to watch. When the remote begins to reprogram itself based on his seeming preferences, the darker and more serious aspects of the movie kick in. The mood is kept from ever becoming too dark through the injection of humor into even the most poignant and wrenching of circumstances, keeping the second half from becoming morose. I found the ending somewhat predictable, but satisfying none the less. For a quick summuation of Click, look to the review title.
0767817478|5.0|I first watched this movie in theaters when it came out and I absolutely loved it. I guess I'm different in that I never went into it with the intention or idea of comparing it to the original Godzilla. I knew it was a reinterpretation and I thought it was awesome. My 16 yr old son and I watched it recently on one of the cable movie channels and he was even more entertained by it than I, if that's possible. If you look at this film that way instead of trying to compare it to the original you will see an exciting, action packed film that really is awe inspiring and terrifying. Yes, it does have its campy, funny moments... they just have nothing to do with the monster. I honestly don't understand why people didn't enjoy this film. My own sister, who's just as big a Godzilla fan as I, didn't enjoy it. \\"He's not the original Godzilla!!\\" No, he's not. He's bigger, faster, meaner... better. I'm gonna end up buying it.

B00005MP58|4.0|Whether or not the dvd is in the best of conditions, I still love having it at hand to watch whenever I want. The dvds are not as bad quality as an old VHS but not up to standards as a DVD. IMO, Colin Firth makes up for this.     This is my favorite on screen adaptation of Jane Austen's novels. I have been sorely disappointed with others, save for the 1995 version of Sense and Sensibility, with Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet. (I HATE the recent P&P movie with Keira Knightly - I have absolutely no respect for her after that movie. In plainest words, she was HORRIBLE.)     In this production, a few things were slightly changed but overall stayed true to the novel a lot better than I could have imagined. I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewer who said this can be watched over and over again. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle just pull you in head first into the story.     One thing I really don't like about this dvd set - no subtitles! I hate dvds not having subtitles. It's hard to understand what's being said because I am not used to British accents and especially when everyone is speaking softly.  Sometimes my tv makes up for it and add captions on but otherwise I have to rewind and listen again to some parts of the movie.    The colors are a bit washed out which I don't mind because it adds to the story which takes place in another era.  It sets the mood for me because I am not seeing everything vibrantly.  I think it psychologically works better because it creates the atmosphere necessary to recreate an \\"old world charm.\\"  If that doesn't work for you, just readjust the colors of your tv.     FYI - I am referring to the edition that was released in 2001 NOT the new version.  The newer version is apparently digitally remastered and both versions of this dvd display the same reviews.

B0002O7XVI|5.0|Every once in awhile a film comes along that it should only be spoken of in hushed tones.  Roman Polanski's  TESS is one of those films.  To place it in context, there are moments in the film DR.ZIVAGO that are some of the most beautiful on film... they are a stark relief to the majority, which is snow covered and bleak.  , Being set in lush countryside, 80% of TESS is that gorgeous, making it one of the most visually beautiful films ever made.  It won Geoffrey Unsworth & Ghislain Cloquet 1981's Best Cinematography Oscar.  (Unsworth died of a heart attack ½ way through production.)  It also rightfully won for Art Direction and Costume Design.<br /><br /> Like DR.Z., this film tells the story of the downfall of a lower class girl who has neither the schooling or upbringing to fight for herself, in Hardy's unrelenting sad story (written after he had become depressed in the wake of reading Darwin, and saw the dying way of life that industrialization was bringing about).<br /><br />  Natassja Kinski is luminous and looks a bit like Sharon Tate, and reminiscent of young Ingrid Berman here, in look, but also very much in persona and even her voice.  Now wonder it has been hard for her to follow this film.  Few roles could match it, few productions have gelled this completely.  Peter Firth as her misguidedly moral husband is perfectly matched with her, and they both give richly felt performances.<br /><br /> The musical score is soaring and melancholy, the costumes are just right, whether they be the muddy field workers or the finery of a fallen woman, and the shades of class within different farms are delineated here, too, in costumes and set, and the golden days of the happy farm to the grey skies of the sad.  All elements are in  perfect accord in this literary adaptation that necessarily cuts a few scenes from the novel, but keeps the story amazingly intact.<br /><br /> I've read the book twice.  The BBC did a Miniseries of TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLE'S in the late 1990s, and while it's length maintains some of the details of the story, neither it's somnambulent leading lady nor it's visuals can compare to the wonderful performance here of Kinsky, and the constantly awe inspiring visuals, scene after breathtaking scene.<br /><br />  Polanski tells us that Tate had given him this book, as she had been told it would be perfect for her.  He did not read it until after her death, so this film is a fully realized bittersweet chanson d'amour.  A classic of cinema in every sense of the word.while it's length maintains some of the details of the story, neither it's somnambulent leading lady nor it's visuals can compare to the wonderful performance here of Kinsky, and the constantly awe inspiring visuals, scene after breathtaking scene.   <br />     Polanski tells us that Tate had given him this book, as she had been told it would be perfect for her.

B000003TA4|5.0|Great, but not a patch on In Utero. It doesn't have the rawness (with exception to say breed and territorial pissings) that Nirvana were all about in Bleach, In Utero, Incesticide and their live material. Its a great album, with great tracks that has influenced so many people and so many bands. However In Utero is a much vaster recording spanning different moods and styles of music, and to me has a lot more passion in it compared to this slightly weakened pop version of Nirvana. I also think In Utero tells so much more about what the band were going through at that phase with pain, love and disillusionment. If you want the definitive Nirvana album go for In Utero, its like a mature and refined bleach. However you should be buying all nirvana albums as they are the best band of the lates 80s and early 90s, the only band really to get even close to their impact in the 90s was Radiohead. BTW if you looking for some raw nirvana, try and find out of the blue which is the bootleg recording of Nirvana at Seattle Uni in 89...its INCREDIBLE and has the best version of sappy/vcv and negative creep ever.
B000E8QVWY|3.0|This movie is a good work of fiction, based on the life of Johnnie Cash and June Carter.  You get drawn in and care about most of the characters, good or bad, because the acting is so excellent. The excellent acting is supported by a very well-crafted screen play with some wonderful lines and scenes. It's a treat if you like good acting. However, if you want the real story of Johnny Cash, you need to go elsewhere.<br /><br />For example, the film makes the central event in Cash's life the death of his brother Jack.  Indeed, the film opens with an adult performing Cash, pausing before he goes on at his historical Folsom prison show, paralyzed by seeing a circular saw like the one that alledgedly killed his brother.<br />In this film Jack allegedly  sawing wood for a dollar about the age of 9 when Johnny is tagging along with him about the age of 6 or 7.  Jack tells little Johnnie to go on fishing and he will catch up. Jack has an accident and later dies.  Little Johnnie is not there, so his father reproaches him for. Dad heaps a lot of cruelty on this very young child. Guilt and angst over this clouds the rest of Cash's life and poisons Cash's relationship with his father. The pivotal scene in the movie is an adult confrontation between Johnnie and his father over this.<br /><br />However, this whole business was made up.  Cash's brother died in an accident in high school machine shop class!<br /><br />Johnnie's first wife Vivian is  a victim of this film. She's portrayed as a very conventional, Southern white wife, who is continually asking Johnny to forsake music to go and work in her father's business. She's quite at home with the Bible-Belt culture of Cash's attempts at a gospel career but seems just to be a conservative anti-music force.  The viewer thinks she wants Johnnie to go back to Arkansas's cotton country.<br /><br />  However, Vivian Dorraine Liberto Cash was a Mexican-American. Cash wooed her while he was stationed in San Antonio in the US Air Force. At the time Vivian was a student at an all-girls Catholic high school. The film provides no information about the kind of culture and racial clash that Cash's having a Catholic, Mexican-American wife must have been in 1950s and early 1960s Arkansas and Tennesse.<br /><br />  Instead, Vivian is potrayed as a conservative, money oriented, music hater in contrast to the wittier, more attractive, and more meaningful June Carter. Vivian is also pictured as a fairly unsophisticated looking house-wife type.  In fact, throughout their marriage, Vivian was very glamorous and attractively dressed and made up. She looked more like a movie star than June Carter whose main act until she hooked up with Cash was as a country girl corn pone comedian, a kind of younger version of Minnie Pearl.<br /><br />The truth is that Johnny Cash quite freely admitted that his marriage to Vivian ended only because of his own drug addiction, abuse, and unfaithfulness. Both Cash and Vivian Dorraine Liberto have said that they would never have parted except for Cash's drug addiction. As Cash said in the 1970s,\\"I have to take blame for that -- because no woman can live with a man who's strung out on amphetamines<br /><br />  _Walk the Line_ says nothing about Cash's musical and political embrace of the changes in the 1960s as a result of the civil rights movement, the anti-Vietnam war struggle, and the youth radicalization.<br /><br />For example, in the mid 1960s as Cash recovered from addiction, many Country artists backed the right-wing pro-war \\"Silent Majority\\" cultural campaign against the movements for Black liberation, against the Vietnam War, and for native and prisoner's rights.  I can remember driving through Florida and Alabama seeing promoting then Nashville Super Stars George Jones and Tammy Wynette's appearances at rallies for George Wallace.<br /><br /> Instead, Cash embraced the music made by the new generation and the political questioning that went on.  The film does picture him doing Bob Dylan's \\"It Ain't me Babe\\" and listening to Dylan's \\"Highway 61.\\"  However, only a more-than middle aged music buff like me who remembers those songs and the controversy in Country music circles Cash's friendship and performances with Dylan caused can understand what's involved the way _Walk the Line- portrays it.<br /><br />Nothing is also said about Cash's championing of new-breed Nashville song writers like Kris Kristofferson. Cash's determination to perform Kris's \\"Sunday Morning Coming Down\\" with its references to being stoned on drugs despite NBC's attempt to censor the song was big news at the time.<br /><br />  When Cash was first invited to the White House by Richard Nixon, Nixon asked him to sing an anti-welfare recipient song called \\"Welfare Cadillac\\" and Haggard's \\"Okie from Muskogee,\\" a song that had become an anthem for right wing culture war opponents of the changes of the 1960s, even though it was written as a parody of the \\"silent majority,\\" by a marijuana high Haggard while he band bus tooled through that Oklahoma town. Cash refused because he did not agree with the outlook of those songs.<br /><br />  Cash's decision to dress all in black is pictured in _Walk the Line_ as just his choice one time when nothing else was available back in the 1950s.  Yet, his decision to wear black and his identification with it only came in the late 1960s.<br /><br />Cash always made it clear that he wore Black because he identified with the struggles of society's victims. He wrote a song explaining why he wore black which says: \\"I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down, / Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town, / I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime, / But is there because he's a victim of the times.\\"<br /><br />_Walk the Line_ doesn't tell us about that Johnnie Cash.<br /><br />This movie's executive producer is John Carter Cash, the child of Johnnie Cash and June Carter Cash.  I guess to him the most important thing in Johnny's life was his parents getting together.  Otherwise, John Carter Cash wouldn't have been born!  Perhaps, this is why the film streamlines Cash's life down to a fictional romance between Johnnie and June.  Perhaps, his father's political and musical radicalism in the 1960s and 1970s is not to John Carter Cash's taste.<br /><br />Yet,  John Carter Cash and the people he worked with were able to find some great screen writers and an outstanding cast of actors.  They give remarkable performances that make this a worthwhile film, despite its distance from the truth.y 61.\\"  However, only a more-than middle aged music buff like me who remembers those songs and the controversy in Country music circles Cash's friendship and performances with Dylan caused can understand what's involved the way _Walk the Line- portrays it.

B000003TAR|5.0|Best commercial Nirvana album. The songs have way more passion that Nevermind ever had and really convey what the band and Kurt was going through at the time (pain, love, disillusionment). Songs like Serve the servants, frances farmer will have her revenge on seattle, very ape and radio friendly unit shifter are some of the best songs ever produced by Nirvana, up there with negative creep, love buzz, school, aneurysm, breed and territorial pissings. This is definitely in the top 10 albums of all time and it's as necessary as Led Zeppelin II and Beatles - Revolver.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|I must admit that I never watched this show during its first season, thinking that it was more for young teenagers.  However, I was channel surfing this September, and happened to catch the first episode of this season.  It was so good I immediately hooked up with Amazon and bought the dvd set of the first season.  I have finally found a replacement for the X Files!!  The supernatural phenomena are what makes the x files and this series so good, along with the subtle humor between the main characters.  I enjoyed watching the relationship between the two brothers evolve, as well as the dynamic among the brothers and father.  The young stars are actually very good and very believable.    Having just discovered this show, I worry now that the writers will start changing the basic premise and start getting all \\"mystical\\".  There are plenty of unexplainable events that can be fodder for \\"supernatural\\" stories.    I noticed on the dvd that each episode is only about 40 minutes long, including the introduction.  I must say the writers are doing a great job with developing the plotline and resolving the issue in such a short time. Not a lot of time is wasted in transition or background.  We are given the information we need to know to enjoy the program.  And these stories can be very scary!  Ironically, the episode which scared me the most was the one episode that was NOT \\"supernatural\\", The Benders.  Very frightening, especially since it is easy to believe that there are people like that out there.  All in all, you don't need to be a teen-ager to enjoy this show.
1596912367|4.0|When Ruth, a single mother and teacher of English as a Second Language, goes to Middle Ashton to visit her mother, Sally Gilmartin, in 1976, she receives a surprise.  When Ruth is ready to go home, Sally gives her a folder entitled _The Story of Eva Delectorskaya_.  Ruth has never heard of Eva--until her mother stuns her by announcing, \\"I am Eva Delectorskaya.\\"  Sally believes that someone is trying to kill her, and she wants Ruth to help her find Lucas Romer, her former boss in a British spy agency, during World War II.<br /><br />The novel which ensues from the additional folders Eva gives to Ruth alternates between Ruth's life in the 1970s and the life of Eva Delectorskaya from 1939 through 1942.  A Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; to Paris, Eva is recruited by British intelligence, and once she has been trained (and has removed all traces of a foreign accent from her voice), she is sent to Belgium, where she works for Agence d'Information Nadal, a front organization which plants disinformation which the allies hope the Germans will accept as truth.  Later she goes to Holland with Lucas Romer, her boss, and eventually to Manhattan.<br /><br />Ruth's life, far more plebeian than Eve's, revolves around her teaching of foreign students, her care for her son, her friendship with Hamid Kazemi, an Iranian student and engineer, and her involvement in activist politics.  When Ruth succeeds in locating Lucas Romer, the two story lines come together in a grand climax.<br /><br />Always a master of narrative pacing, Boyd keeps the story moving smartly, though Eve's story is far more interesting and more involving than Ruth's.  His ability to recreate the atmosphere of Europe and the US in 1942 makes for lively reading as he explores some of the lesser known intrigues by British intelligence.  Boyd has often made use of diaries and journals to advance his plots, and this formula works as the reader becomes fascinated by Eve's complex life as a spy.  Unfortunately, the characters themselves are not very complex, and as a result, the reader remains at arm's length from the action.  With its unusual plot twists and its focus on British spy activity within the US, however, the novel moves quickly and is fun to read. n Mary Whippled as a result, the reader remains at arm's length from the action.

B000002H97|2.0|Metallica from the very beggining had huge potential but never lived up to it. They made some ok songs along the way but never had an entire album that was worth anything. This album is the only one of them all that I think is ok. It's the only one I can listen to and really the only one that is ok all the way through. Still not a huge fan of the album but its the best they did. Overrated but not to bad. Plenty of other bands that are way better.
0142000671|5.0|Written in 1937, when the Depression was still affecting all aspects of the farming community, this powerful novel depicts the lives of migrant workers--grim, pessimistic, and offering little hope for an improved future.  Focusing on two characters who arrive in the Salinas Valley during peak season, Steinbeck creates touching scenes between Lenny, a big, severely limited worker who does not know his own strength, and George, a whippet-thin man who serves as Lenny's constant companion and protector.<br /><br />Both Lenny and George have dreams of one day living on their own farm, where Lenny, who loves the feeling of soft things--even dead mice--wants to take care of rabbits.  George hopes one day to benefit from his own hard work on his own farm and to create an environment where Lenny can be safe from his own impulses.  As Steinbeck brings the characters on the ranch to life, he shows how every person there has dreams of a different life but few opportunities to change the lives they already have.  Some are physically handicapped from accidents on farms, while others are emotionally handicapped by lack of opportunity or their own personal limitations.<br /><br />Life is lonely, uncertain, and harsh but George tries to make life for Lenny more bearable by allowing him to have one of the new puppies in the barn.  When Curley, the boss's son, brings his flirtatious wife to the farm, he introduces a new element which eventually leads to a tragic ending.  Women are considered dangerous to the status quo, as they reinforce the need for \\"soft\\" elements in lives that otherwise offer little softness.<br /><br />Giving vivid pictures of the natural surroundings while also creating vivid pictures of the interactions of these men, Steinbeck shows that even among those whose lives offer little hope, there is a desire to take advantage of each other.  Crooks, the black stable hand who is forced to live alone in the barn, undermines Lenny.  Carlson takes advantage of Candy's love for his old, smelly dog and causes pain to Candy.  Lenny's puppy, Candy's dog, a heron capturing a water snake, and dreams of their own farm all become symbols which add to the drama of the conclusion.  In this powerfully sad novel, Steinbeck offers little hope that the lives  of these men will improve and even less hope that they will ever be able to control what happens to them. n Mary Whipplely dog and causes pain to Candy.

0385720920|5.0|I take pleasure in the forbidden, the out of bounds, the uncontrollable, even when I'm not an active participant.  Chuck Palahniuk delivers all that and more in his novels and, in my opinion, Choke is the best of the bunch.<br /><br />Victor Mancini is the main character of this novel, and for all intents, the only character in the novel - the rest of the cast is under developed and each exists in the novel to occupy a certain piece of the development of Victor.  Who is he?  He's a choker - a man who chokes on food intentionally in restaurants in order to give others the opportunity to be the hero, to save his life, and to take some responsibility for him thereafter.  He's a sex addict - a man who has sex with any woman, anywhere, anytime.  He's the Son of God - and believes that with good reason.  He takes on all the sins of others.  He's a loser, working a dead-end and abusive job.<br /><br />But most of all, he's us - each of us have this martyr inside.  You know, the person inside us screaming for attention at all costs, screaming to be noticed, to be liked, to be the center of it all.  That person is Victor Mancini in all his psychotic glory, living out the horror of our nightmares.<br /><br />Palahniuk has this gift for modern day horror - the kind of story that makes one cringe.  He does it without monsters, without darkness, without stabbing serial killers.  Chuck Palahniuk does it with possibility, for each of his stories deals with the worst outcome of the obsessions we all share.  He tears the blindfold from the reader's eyes and shows them what they could become and it's disgusting.<br /><br />Choke isn't for everyone - the language is graphic, the sex explicit, the vision disturbing.<br /><br />- CV Rick
0780622642|2.0|If a movie is going to be really bad, it should have some camp value added in: i.e. real humor of some kind, some excitement and unexpected events, and some good hammy dialog. This groaner has almost none of these things, at least to my understanding. I did watch this two times over the years, once in the theatre, and another buying this tape for 99 cents. I really do like most science fiction films I've seen in the last 40 years, including many critical failures and campy low budget and high budget films. So I am qualified to submit an opinion. Lost is Space does have some entertainment value for kids. It is just OK, if you can turn down your IQ rather drastically and lower expectations also. I was able to do both a little the second time, and enjoyed it somewhat. In the theatre, I ended up walking out before the ending. This is the only time I have done this because of a movie. (One other time I did because of an audience laughing at some torture scenes, but that is another story.) <br />Both times I saw this, the first part really seems like it is supposed to be a video game, and there is some expectation or question of when is the movie going to start? The problem is, it never does. Saying the story has not much revelance has become a cliche for movie reviewers who don't have enough to support their arguments, but in this case it is very true. Nearly every twist and turn of this story (there are a lot for such a bad movie), causes the story to worsen. So by the end, when the story has no ending, one really doesn't care at all. Knowing that a needed sequel never got made gives one a feeling of justice in the universe.
0156012197|5.0|I wish I understood French well enough to be able to read it in its original language (without the help of a dictionary) because I suspect that something has been lost in the translation. Even so, this book bears the hallmark of something great: it makes you feel happy, and sad, both at the same time. The story itself is a curiosity and seems almost drug-inspired. However, the message (or rather one of its many messages) is one that needs to be read and understood by adults, not children. The message is: life is absurd, don't take yourself too seriously, and don't be afraid to make friends and love others. This is a book that could and hopefully will change your life, for the better.
B0001KU93C|3.0|I had vaguely heard of this movie. I am a big fan of the Sergio Leone spagetti westerns but have seen very few other westerns of that genre. I also like Franco Nero after being exposed to him the first time in the movie The Salamander. I was looking up some info on Franco and I came across some info on his movies and read about Django. Many said that it was equal to the Leone westerns and that it was darker and more brutal. After watching it, and enjoying Django, I must say that I don't think that it is on par with any of the Leone westerns. That is not to say that it is not good though. When you consider that most of the time they didn't even have a script and that they improvised the script most of the time, it is a pretty entertaining movie. The cast of characters is really good and like Leone the faces that he comes up with to play the parts are all interesting. It is a down and dirty western with lots of mud, dirt, and plenty of really over the top violence including an ear scene that inspired Quenting Tarrentino to film his scene in Resevoir Dogs. The gun play is also cool and Django himself is one cool dude.<br /><br />This movie of course is dumbed in English. Unlike the Leone westerns I don't think there are any English speaking actors. Nero is dubbed and the guy has the typical hero voice but it is ok (not great and if it was redone I would love to have somebody else dubbed in or Nero himself). I also liked the little documentary interview they did with Franco as well as the trailers they showed.<br /><br />Again, it's a fun movie and Django and his coffin are dynamite in action!
B000GYI32M|3.0|Okay, we all know season 3 sucked, but we just couldnt stop watching because we all secretly wish that maybe,just maybe, next weeks episode would be so amazing and it would be like we were back in season one... <br /> <br /> <br />that never happened. and it probably wont happen next season either, but that wont stop me from watching. I love this show.  Yeah, Killing Marissa was a dumb idea, even though I disliked her, but it was dumb- she was in the core group.   <br /> <br />I love this show. I love Seth,Summer, Sandy, Ryan, Kirsten,Julie... I love the original lineup.  the fact that next season is going to follow kaitlin pisses me off. She is not that great of a character,she was annoying last season and she will be this season.  But, Seth/Summer will still be there, same with Sandy, Ryan & co. so it cant be that awful. <br /> <br />Season 3 is definitely not as good as season 1 or 2, but hey, its still going to make big bucks.  Fans are going to buy it because thatst just what we do. Season 2 wasnt all that, but I still bought it.  It sucks that this bright, hilarious, mind-blowing every week program is now this dull, predictable, dud..... <br /> <br />This show has the potential to be just as good as its' first season. <br /> <br />I'll get off my soapbox now and get back to the point... If your even looking at these reviews, obviously you're a fan and you've been watching since the beginning.  you love this show even if it disappoints you. it's like a relationship. you love what it use to be, you love the familiar faces, and you keep going back even if it lets you down.  so stop reading these reviews, if you've got the money- buy it. <br /> <br /> <br />its not the most awful thing out on shelves. it's the OC. and The OC= Seth Cohen. Sandy Cohen. Summer Roberts.Ryan Atwood. Julie Cooper. Kirsten Cohen.and oh yeah-marissa (for the fans of that one out there) and they are amazing and they make the show. <br /> <br />
B0000025RI|5.0|Jazz, R&B, Rock, Soul, Funk, and Pop music had all existed before 1982, but when this album came out, it literally combined all the elements and paved the way for what music is today. From recordings to performances to worldwide sales and recognition, Jackson set the standards for it all. Hundreds of years from now, this will still be looked back on as quite possibly one of the finest albums ever recorded. <br /> <br />While Quincy maintained his masterful touch on all the recordings, Jackson lent his to the timeless compositions of \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", \\"Beat It\\", and \\"Billie Jean\\", songs that have literally become signature songs of the 1980s, and showed the world just how musical Michael could be. Aside from those recordings, master songwriter Rod Temperton (\\"Rock with You\\", \\"Off the Wall\\", \\"Always and Forever\\") and R&B soulman James Ingram contributed their own unique tracks, as well. From \\"Thriller\\" to \\"P.Y.T.\\", every song here literally changed the course of music as a whole. <br /> <br />While some have maintained that there are far better albums in music history's catalogue, I have yet to come across any with as much quality, energy, diversity, and versatility as this one. A masterpiece.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|Silent Hill is the kind of horror film where having a completely logical story wouldn't make sense.  The thing that makes Silent Hill so great is the way it leaves the audience guessing what's happening.  It's not meant to have a simple understandable storyline.  In other words, it's not like the Friday the 13th series.  It's NOTHING like that.   <br /> <br />I really think people who dislike the movie really ought to give it another chance.  Don't worry about whether or not you can figure it out- just absorb the excellent suspense the film delivers from beginning to end. <br /> <br />With that said, I own and play the original Silent Hill all the time for my Playstation One.  It was truly a revolutionary step forward in the world of video gaming, a step the creators didn't think the people were ready for.  Hey, I was surprised how scared I was to play the game, and had to keep the light on while I played, so maybe we weren't ready after all. <br /> <br />The only thing I wish the movie had done differently was have the main character (the parent) be a man.  In the movie, it's a woman and her daughter.  In the video game, it's a man and his daugther.  Besides that, you really need to look into this wonderful film and expect the unexpected.
B000HIVQLW|2.0|I really enjoy virtually everything Pink Floyd has recorded, and my luke-warm rating shouldn't be taken as an indictment of the songs on this compilation.  For anyone new to the band's music, this playlist is an interesting sampling of \\"classic\\" PF songs (that being materials written & recorded before Roger Waters' departure from the band). <br /> <br />However, for existing fans possessing many or all of their original regordings, this is a virtually redundant collection.  What is more, I have always felt as though the whole of many of Pink Floyd's albums are greater than the sum of their parts and, not unlike many classical recordings or classic rock \\"operas\\" like The Who's \\"Tommy\\", listening to a Pink Floyd album in full provides additional context and enhances one's appreciation for the material.  This strikes me as particularly true with the recordings between 1973 - 1983. <br /> <br />As a separate note, given that the collection is limited to songs recorded with Roger Waters, I wonder what/who selected the playlist. <br />
B000CNE092|5.0|I can't say enough how wonderful this movie is.  I watched it on HBO the other night and can't believe I ignored the movie for so long!  The only problem is that some of the musical numbers aren't quite as memorable as others.  In fact, I'm happy to say the film is not entirely a dance/musical, and features more story than anything else.  A good story about an orphan not sure which path she wants to travel down.   <br /> <br />In addition to that, you have very good animation.  As someone said below, it's almost unbelievable how REAL certain scenes feel.  The scene in the beginning with the man and woman dancing is a good example.  I loved the story, loved the characters, and would gladly watch it again.
B000002J27|5.0|Yes, yes - Phil Collins had been there the whole time, proving to be an excellent drummer and part-time vocalist, but it was here that he became lead vocalist, if not quite the dominant songwriting voice he was to become. It may be hard for some to realize how controversial this was at the time. To many, Peter Gabriel's lyrics, voice, and on-stage theatrics were Genesis, and few thought that Collins (or anyone, for that matter) could fill the huge gap that he left. How could anyone write music to match that of \\"The Musical Box,\\" or \\"The Cinema Show,\\" with their lyrical sophistication and musical prowess? Many thought Genesis would never recover. <br /> <br />What a shock A Trick of the Tail must have been! It's a stunning example of progressive rock at its peak - majestic, thrilling, and well-written music all around. True, Phil Collins does his best to sound exactly like Peter Gabriel here, but who could blame him? And, after all, he does a really good job of it. The band also displays the startling virtuosity they had developed on classics like Foxtrot and The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. They sound excellent. <br /> <br />All of which would mean nothing if the songwriting weren't up to par. Instead of trying to rewrite past classics, it builds on them. A Trick of the Tail is at once dramatic (\\"Dance on a Volcano\\"), beautiful (\\"Entangled,\\" \\"Ripples\\"), whimsical (the title track, \\"Squonk\\"), and sly (\\"Robbery, Assault and Battery\\"). When you look closely, you certainly see their predecessors in the Gabriel era. Sure, \\"Dance on a Volcano\\" is similar in tone to \\"Watcher of the Skies.\\" Yeah, \\"Robbery, Assault and Battery\\" is kinda like \\"Get 'Em Out By Friday\\" or \\"The Battle of Epping Forest\\" in its wit. And \\"A Trick of the Tail\\" could be compared to \\"I Know What I Like (In My Wardrobe).\\" But, and this is to the key to this album's success, they hold their own with those earlier classics. This is not the sound of a band trying to replicate its past glories, but rather the sound of one that knows how to play to its strengths and write excellent songs. You don't miss Peter Gabriel on A Trick of the Tail because the rest of the band was as much a part of the sound of this band as Gabriel. <br /> <br />I'm a tiny bit reluctant to say this is a good entry point to Genesis, because I think that one should acquaint oneself with the Peter Gabriel era first, but this would probably make a great first album if you haven't heard anything by the band yet. It's a bit less dense than, say \\"Supper's Ready,\\" so it may be more appealing and less overwhelming than those earlier albums. Suffice to say that this is a progressive rock classic, and all fans of the genre will find this a rewarding work of art.
B00005JPBP|5.0|2006 has been a quiet year for event films. The predicted blockbusters this past summer pretty much underperformed despite some being exactly as good as I thought they'd be. Other than Johnny Depp and the gang's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, every blockbuster didn't blow the industry out of the water. It's a very good thing that I had smaller films to tide me over. This year has been a very good ones for some independent-minded and smaller films which came out during the slow first couple months of the year and during the graveyard release months between the end of summer and the start of the late year holidays. I've already had the chance to see such very good films like Running Scared from Wayne Kramer and Hard Candy from David Slade to The Proposition from John Hillcoat. I am glad to say that Christopher Nolan's film adaptation of Christopher Priest's novel, The Prestige is another non-blockbuster that excites, entertains and, in the end, keeps the audience mystified but not confused.<br /><br />I've read Christopher Priest's novel about dueling late 19th-century London magicians. It's a novel written in epistolary format with each chapter and section written as entries into the journal of one of the main characters in the story. The novel itself is pretty straightforward as it tells the story in near chronological order. I was hesistant to embrace this film adaptation when I first heard about it since alot of the mystery of of the story wouldn't translate so well in film if they followed the strict order of how the story was told in the novel. For Christopher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, to just adapt the novel straight-out would've made for a dull and boring mystery-thriller. I was glad that the Nolan brothers were inventive enough to borrow abit from Christopher Nolan's first feature film, Memento. Their film adaptation of The Prestige doesn't go backwards in its narrative, but it does mixes up the chronological order of the story somewhat, but not to the point that Tarantino does in Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. The two Nolans fudges abit with the timeline to add some backstory filler to help give the characters that Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman portrays with the reason for their pathological obsession with each other.<br /><br />Christopher and Jonathan Nolan's screenplay for The Prestige was able to keep the mystery of the story intact, but it also keeps the amount of red herrings in such films to a minimum. Michael Caine's character, Harry Cutter, opens up the film explaining just exactly what constitutes a magic trick on stage. How it's divided into three parts. First, there's \\"The Pledge\\" wherein the magician shows the audience something ordinary he or she will use in the trick. Soon, the magician will follow this up with \\"The Turn\\" where the abovementioned ordinary object does something extraordinary in front of the audience. The pay-off of the magician's trick is \\"The Prestige\\" where the audience's astonishment occurs as they fail to deconstruct and figure out the means of the trick. That's pretty much the film in a nutshell. It's one big magic trick. The clues are there for the audience to see, gather and extrapolate their answer to the mystery that is the story. The screenplay doesn't treat the audience as if they need to be hand-held throughout the film. In fact, anyone who pays attention will be able to solve one-half of the mystery by the first hour. I won't say exactly whose half of the mystery it will be but people will be kicking themselves afterwards if they don't figure it out right away.<br /><br />This magic trick of a film does have its many underlying layers of themes to add some complexity, drama and tension to the characters of Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman). I've already mentioned that throughout the film their mutual obsession about each other is due to a backstory detailing their past. A past where they were initially friends --- rivals even --- and apprentices to the magician Harry Cutter (excellently played by Michael Caine as the only voice of reason throughout the film). Borden and Angier's obsession is not just in ruining and sabotaging each other's magic tricks and lives, but also trying to find out each other's secrets as they both learn magic tricks which amaze and thrill the gentry of London's stage. From the beginning of the film these two characters begin a journey towards a path of destructive behavior which puts not just each other's lives at risk, but those who they care about. All of it in the name of humiliating and upstaging the other due to a tragic incident early in their mutual careers. These two individuals were not sympathetic characters and I applaud Christopher Nolan and his brother for not softening up their hard edges.<br /><br />Most adaptors will try to make a story's characters more sympathetic and likable. They went the opposite in The Prestige. But even these two dark characters continue to exude the charisma and strong personalities that the audience will root for one or the other. Should they root for the charismatic and born shownman that Hugh Jackman's Angier character plays or go for the perfectionist Borden character Christian Bale plays. A perfectionist whose technical skills surpasses that of Angier's but whose introverted and brooding personality makes him little or no stage presence.<br /><br />Both Jackman and Bale play their characters well. The film wouldn't be so good if it wasn't for the work of these two actors. It helps that they're surrounded by quality supporting character like Michael Caine as the seasoned, veteran mentor to the dueling magicians. Even Scarlett Johansson does very well with the part she's given. It's a part that many sees as more of a throwaway character. A piece of very good-looking distraction for both the story and the audience. But she gamely plays the role of pawn for both Angier and Borden. Unlike Michael Caine's character who remains the singular voice of sanity in the film, even Johansson's character of Olivia gets pulled into the obsessions and betrayals that's plagued both Angier and Borden. But in the end, she's just part of the process of \\"The Turn\\" and if people have been watching the film closely right from the beginning then she's also a clue as to the secret of one of the amazing magic tricks shown by the two magicians.<br /><br />The Prestige also has a distinct look about it. The 19th-century London just before the start of the new millenium gives it a certain sense of Victorian-era familiarity. Production designer Nathan Crowley shows a London at the height of its Gilded Age, but soon gives way to a certain steampunk look as inventor Nikola Tesla makes an appearance during an integral part of the story. David Bowie portrays Tesla as an eccentric genius whose search for the secrets of the universe will lead to the discovery of what many of that era would consider magic. It's the ingenius looking technology created for the Tesla sequence which finally gives The Prestige it's root in fantasy and science-fiction. The film doesn't dwell on this new development but from that part of the story and until the end, the film takes on a look and feel of a steampunk mystery-thriller. There's not enough films that tries to mine this new subgenre and I, for one, am glad that Christopher Nolan added this new dimension to the film's overall look.<br /><br />In the end, The Prestige really needs to be seen to be appreciated and for people to make up their minds about the film. Some will see it as a thriller with twists and turns that doesn't insult the intelligence of its audience. Some may see the film as just one large gimmick from start to end. Those people will probably be correct as well. The film at its most basic level is one long magic trick with all three acts. It has \\"The Pledge\\" which is then followed up by \\"The Turn\\" and then ends with \\"The Prestige\\". It will be up to each individual who sees the film to make the final decision as to whether they've bought into all three acts of the magic trick that is The Prestige, or come away having felt like they've wasted their time. I've not come across many who felt like the latter, even those whose own feelings about the film don't reach the same level of praise as I have for Christopher Nolan's latest offering. All I know is that this is a film that delivers on its premise to confound and amaze. It also continues to validate my views that Bruce Wayne and Batman are in very good hands with Christopher Nolan at the wheel.

B00005NKKV|4.0|They've pretty well captured some of the problems that this particular album has, which is a rare and wonderful event.  If you've listened to The Paul Simon Songbook, you know that, while he could do the occasional good job (Kathy's Song), in his early twenties, Paul Simon was not much of a songwriter.  This is a relatively direct, unnuanced, pretentious record for what was essentially a direct, unnuanced, pretentious time.  At times, it can sound like an angsty teenage girl's private poetry collection.  These are all correct and valid assertions, and if that sort of thing is going to bother you, you might be better advised to stay away. <br /> <br />What the album also has, however, is a number of quality musical efforts.  Kathy's Song and April, Come She Will are both good indicators of what was to come from Paul Simon in his later work.  While this may be among the least of Simon and Garfunkel's collective output, the worst of their five records is still better than a large body of other music. <br /> <br />Regarding the bonus material, this is also one of those happy instances where I can actually recommend to buyers interested in getting the newly expanded CD that they buy it.  Rather than a mess of demos and mono mixes that sound essentially the same (the policy that Columbia pursued on much of the other Paul Simon rereleases), this CD actually has four previously unavailable, mostly good songs to its credit.  I could personally have lived my life without hearing the Simon and Garfunkel interpretation of Barbriallen, but fans will be happy to have all of the additional material. <br /> <br />For other listeners, if you're just looking for the \\"best\\" Simon and Garfunkel record, or a start with the duo, it might be better to try Bookends or Bridge Over Troubled Water first.  For fans, well, you probably already own this record and I'm not sure why you're still listening.  For more casual listeners just in search of a good overview, you'll probably be satisfied with The Best of Simon and Garfunkel (the twenty song collection - rather than Greatest Hits - gives a more thorough overview).  For people who just like good music, however, while I can't recommend this as their best record, it's certainly worthy of a listen.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|Every Iron Maiden album since Somewhere in Time initially received poor reviews and A Matter of Life and Death will be no different. It seems to me the Maiden albums, especially those with Bruce Dickinson on vocals, take a while to fully open up and envelop the listener if given repeat plays. Multiple listens can be utterly rewarding when listening to post-Blaze albums, as evidenced with the amazing Brave New World, one of the greatest comeback albums ever, and its heavy successor Dance of Death.<br /><br />Speaking of the band's previous two discs with Dickinson at the helm, it is basically impossible not to compare them with A Matter of Life and Death, as Maiden have carved their own niche and created their unique sound years ago. It is daft to expect them to deviate from a sound they made their own through years and years of dedicated work and do \\"something different\\". Do not listen to this album if that's what you are anticipating. This album is still built around the ideas and themes we've come to love Maiden over the years. Steve Harris still lays down numerous galloping riffs and goes back to utilising enchanting keyboards much like the ones on Brave New World. While Dance of Death found Iron Maiden striving for heavier musical statements, their new album sees them going back to the highly gripping melodic-signature writing of Brave New World and injecting that sound with the production values of The X Factor from the Blaze era.<br /><br />It is true that the mix and production of A Matter of Life and Death is no way similar to those heard on its predecessors. Kevin Shirley's engineering has rendered both Dickinson's vocals and the guitar team's tones several decibels lower than most CDs, but therefore, the music is not compressed the least bit and has more vivid dynamics. These mostly shine through during Harris and McBrain's rhythm arrangements, which are noticeably more natural sounding. Even though I'll take a better produced drum sound over this one any day of the week, for this particular disc, the human feel carried over is marvellous. McBrain plays in a relatively more straightforward style through most of the course of the album, but his time changes and crescendos are essential to the songs' flow.<br /><br />What's best about the album is that one will feel he knows all the songs upon first listen, since they are all injected with the classic Maiden signature, but further listens will attest to its diversity. Each new spin warrants something new, as it's virtually impossible not recognize the energy, maturity, and brilliance of this band. On the Gers/Harris-penned \\"The Pilgrim\\" and the brilliant final track \\"The Legacy\\", the folky, upbeat acoustic guitar lines function perfectly underneath Harris' pronounced bass and Dickinson's melodic singing. The former has a subtle eastern feel to it; while \\"The Legacy\\" is a prime example of Iron Maiden's darker songwriting. Almost like a leftover from The X Factor, this song is epic in both its size and execution. Surrounded by claustrophobic, suffocating production elements, it flows seamlessly from ghostly acoustic passages to vital keyboard sequences and majestic fretwork.<br /><br />As with some of their previous material, songs like \\"These Colours Don't Run\\" and \\"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns\\" open up with Harris' slowly building bass arpeggios, only to develop into crushing soundscapes with the arrival of three-part guitar sections. Mind you, the guitar sound of this album is slightly behind those on the band's previous outputs, but there is still plenty of punch and melodic awareness present. The explosive riffs that come after Dickinson's lower register singing on \\"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns\\" are amazing, not to mention Harris' bass solo in perfect harmony with acoustic chords. Adrian Smith also plays a fantastic guitar synth on this piece.<br /><br />\\"The Longest Day\\" arguably features the guitar trio's finest soloing on this disc, as each one has enough spaceto highlight it with their own style and sound, but it is also the brilliant keyboards that elevate it to the next level. \\"Out of the Shadows\\" is the band's ballad-style number, while on \\"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Greeg\\" and the only Harris-penned \\"For the Greater Good of God\\" retreat the album's sound into darker territory, providing thought-provoking themes and lyrical concepts. Dickinson particularly shines on the former, which may be my personal favourite vocal delivery on the album, whilst the latter is defined by clever dynamic shifts and drawn-out guitar work.<br /><br />This is a very solid album. Granted, it won't be in my top 10 of the year or anything, but it more than serves its purpose, and has incredible staying power. Though Brave New World will always be my favourite from the second Dickinson era, I can safely say this one's already surpassed Dance of Death for me.e and sound, but it is also the brilliant keyboards that elevate it to the next level. \\"Out of the Shadows\\" is the band's ballad-style number, while on \\"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Greeg\\" and the only Harris-penned \\"For the Greater Good of God\\" retreat the album's sound into darker territory, providing thought-provoking themes and lyrical concepts.

B00011RPB0|5.0|In her second film, 'Lost in Translation', Sofia Copolla displays her astounding screenwriting capabilities. Capabilities that will hopefully be developed and explored further in the future. Where much of 'Lost in Translation''s beauty comes from is the knowledge of where to allow silences between the characters. This is not a film that is cluttered with unnecessary dialogue, but instead allows silent bonds to develop between the characters, as well as emotions that are unexpressable through conventional speech. <br /> <br />Although never truely spoken or discussed, the silent desperation of Charlotte and Bob is palpable. These are two people who, despite their differing lifestyles, are equally lost, alone and desperate for someone who understands them. This is what gives the film its tragic beauty. Within this script it would have been all too easy to fall into the 'mid-life crisis' cliches, however these are deftly avoided. <br /> <br />It is not just the scriptwriting that is remarkable in this film. The preformances by both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are pitch perfect in what was an outstanding piece of casting. Each of them more than deserving at least an Oscar nomination. <br /> <br />Ultimately 'Lost in Translation' is a masterclass in subtlety, unspoken anguish and unfulfilled affection. In one word, beautiful.
B00005JPAM|4.0|In Stephen Frears and Peter Morgan`s \\"The Queen\\", Helen Mirren gives a spot-on brilliant portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II during arguably the darkest days of her reign: those following the untimely death of Princess Diana.  Through this narrow door of one week's time the audience is provided a wide-angle view of the entirety of the 20th century Elizabethan era, from the effects of the abdication of Edward VIII, through ten prime ministers, to the 1997 arrival of Blair. This portal additionally allows us to see much of the character of PM Tony Blair (played magnificently by Michael Sheen) during the early days of his government.<br /><br />Interspersed with genuine newsreel footage of Diana and the Paris crash, the bulk of the film takes place with the Queen in Balmoral and Blair in No. 10, as the rest of the world sits stunned and shocked at reports of the Alma tunnel crash. Sweeping and glorious panoramas of the Scottish highlands fade in to vistas of flowers piled outside Kensington. The Queen drives around in her Rover tending to her dogs as Blair is driven around London while dealing with the press.<br /><br />With the Royal Family holed up in their country home in apparent dismissive denial (\\"Have you heard from the Spencers on what they wish to do with the funeral?\\"), and a national populace increasingly frustrated by their response, Blair deftly tries to maneuver the monarch into a more sympathetic attitude, all the while deferring to the megalith that is the institution of ER-II. The film shows the delicate interplay of prime minister and monarch, sparing us none of the cagey-ness, mutual respect, and suspicion. Marvelous parallels are drawn between the stalking of a stag on the Balmoral grounds and the stalking and death of the Princess of Wales.<br /><br />Mirren's performance is Oscar worthy. At this writing she has already bagged the Best Actress award at Venice, and will no doubt carry a major sweep of all gilded statues.  She effects a beautiful balance of the stony matronly monarch and the vulnerable womanly mother and grandmother without once giving way to stereotype or parody. She adds great humor to the film with the slightest flicker of a smirk or icy glare. She employs the ever-present purse carried by Her Majesty (why? why?) to great effect.<br /><br />The supporting cast is likewise magnificent and should garner their own share of honors. Syliva Sims is particularly engaging as the jaded, hunched, martini swilling dowager  queen mother. There are no punches pulled vis a vis the characters:Philip is boorish, Cherie Blair is irreverent, Charles is conflicted. Yet each is treated respectfully, and the overall portrayal is realistic and compassionate.<br /><br />Wittily written, wonderfully filmed, and masterfully edited; this is well worth the viewing and will stand the test of time.onarch and the vulnerable womanly mother and grandmother without once giving way to stereotype or parody.

B000003S0R|5.0|...right behind robyn hitchcock and the egyptians' \\"queen elvis\\". 1974 and you just can't believe it. the new remastered edition is monumental listening. many will say his \\"here come the warm jets\\" is the pedistal piece, but i think this is a much more accomplished work. \\"burning airlines...\\" could be recorded today, and you can't turn your head without hearing \\"the fat lady of linbourg\\" in a movie these days. a must for anyone who cares where good music comes from.
B000002AP1|4.0|The last studio album, and a relative calming down after the carnage that was Fun House. But the word \\"calm\\" has to be put into perspective, 'cos it's Iggy Pop and The Stooges that we're talking about here. The violence and excess is still there, but expressed more by the lyrics and wailing guitar work, rather than, erm, a huge wall of noise. <br /> <br />If some of the riffs sound fresh after 35 years, and somehow familiar... well that's either because you're already a Stooges fan, or more likely because the Stooges' influence has reached far and wide. Most people might not have an archaeological interest in early punk, but the more mainstream musicians that followed did, and still do. <br /> <br />And the remix?  Well, \\"Gimme Danger\\" now sounds as good as it should have done from the beginning and \\"Penetration\\" is far more ominous. And \\"Raw Power\\" really is raw. Good. Yes yes yes, it's not the original mix that you listened to all those years ago. It's far, far better than that.

B0009SOFGI|3.0|Compared to the manic energy of what was come later, the first album by The Stooges' sounds... dare I say it... relatively sedate. Relatively, I said. While most of the tracks're sounding a little dated to modern ears, the best tracks, \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\" and \\"No Fun\\", make that magical transition to timelessness, possibly because of their familiarity to those amongst us with an interest in cult music; more likely because of their small but undeniable influence on the mainstream.<br /><br />Why three stars? Well, for me it's now a two track album. Should I buy it? Of course. Why? 'Cos your shopping cart already has the essential Fun House and Raw Power albums in it, so one more won't break the bank. Right? Right.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|A two-disc set including all of the band's hits from 1975-1987, as well as some album tracks and lessor-known songs.  The packaging is attractive, and the remastering is outstanding.  Although I personally feel that the five studio albums from this lineup of the band are superior than any compilation, the set will fit the bill nicely for those who are looking a collection with all of the hits and most of the significant album tracks.  This peaked at #12 on the Hot 200 and is as close to a definitive compilation of this era of the band as there is.
B0009SOFFY|5.0|This is it, look no further: Fun House is The Stooges' manic, excessive, drug, alcohol and sex-fuelled homage to everything and anything that yer bona fide very naughty boy could ever do to have fun fun fun. Nihilistic madness, the lot of it, but not yer sophisticated New Yorker dressed in black sort of nihilism. More of yer trailer trash rebel who doesn't want to miss a minute of it. <br /> <br />Picture this album as the unfolding story of a weekend's rampage, beginning with the opportunistism of \\"Down on the Street\\" and ending up with the come-down of \\"L.A. Blues\\". The musical mayhem in between describes pretty candidly what he gets up to. Probably a cracking party, but one that few of us could survive intact. Some pleasures are better experienced vicariously, methinks.
B000002KXO|4.0|After the ambitious yet commercially disappointing double album TUSK, Fleetwood Mac retreated from the avant garde rock of that previous album and released MIRAGE, a comparatively traditional pop album.  Commercially, the album was a big success, shooting straight to much-covenanted #1 position on the Hot 200 and spinning off a couple of classic singles.  While the assessable approach of the disc is neither as intriguing nor as musically stimulating as TUSK, the MOR stylings of MIRAGE is nonetheless as appealing and as well-crafted a piece of pop product as one could hope for.  However, the album also works musically - and that is something that has unfortunately gone unacknowledged by many fans and critics.  <br /> <br />All three of the Mac's principal songwriters turn in material that is top-notch.  Christine McVie penned the smash hit \\"Hold Me\\" (#4 Pop, #7 Adult Contemporary, #3 Mainstream Rock), with a unique pseudo-oriental arrangement, gorgeous duet vocals from Christine and Lindsey, and killer refrain.  It remains a classic single in the Fleetwood Mac canon.  McVie also contributes the hit  \\"Love In Store\\" (#22 Pop, #11 Adult Contemporary), a bouncy mid-tempo love song, fleshed out with lovely harmony vocals that recall the very best of the Beach Boys and the Mamas and the Papas.  McVie's other two compositions are completely solid as well.  Her wistful \\"Only Over You\\" is dreamy and sensual, and her \\"Wishing You Were Here\\" is a lovely, delicate ballad that manages to avoid cliche and achieve genuine poignancy. <br /> <br />Lindsey Buckingham is apparently the only one of the three writers who was still in an experimental frame of mine.  The somewhat gloomy \\"Empire State\\" and the revved-up rocker \\"Eyes of the World\\" are perfect showcases for Buckingham's remarkably inventive production, and \\"Eyes\\" features a blistering guitar solo that would make Hendrix proud.  The sputtering \\"Can't Go Back\\" is a reflective number in the same vein as RUMOURS' \\"Never Going Back Again,\\" while \\"Book of Love\\" and Oh Diane\\" (#35 Adult Contemporary) are old fashioned rock songs that pay homage to Buckingham's own musical influences.  Somehow they succeed at the amazing feat of sounding both new and familiar at the same time.  All of Buckingham's tracks are expertly-crafted and intriguing, his voice has rarely sounded better, and \\"Can't Go Back,\\" \\"Oh Diane,\\" and \\"Eyes of World\\" all rank among his finest compositions. <br /> <br />MIRAGE was also Stevie Nicks' first album with the band after releasing her Multi-Platinum solo debut, 1981's BELLA DONNA.  Impressively, Nicks' supplies MIRAGE with three of her best-written offerings, proving that her loyalty to the band was as strong as ever.  The hit \\"Gypsy\\" (#12 Pop, #9 Adult Contemporary, #4 Mainstream Rock) is perhaps Nicks' best trademark white-lace ballad, and has become one of her most-loved signature songs.  Buckingham's intricate production and the song's memorable refrain (\\"lighting strikes, maybe once, maybe twice) combine to create a aural masterpiece, and Nicks has rarely been in better voice than on this recording.  Nicks' country-styled rocker \\"That's Alright\\" is also pure fun, and \\"Straight Back\\" (#36 Mainstream Rock) is the type \\"Dreams\\"-styled mid-tempo rocker that Nicks does better than anyone. <br /> <br />Though it is certainly true that MIRAGE breaks no new ground and finds the band playing it pretty safe, it also cannot be denied that there are few groups who can craft a pop album that is as consistent and intriguing.  The group's primary goal was to create a commercially successful recording, and they certainly succeeded (in addition to topping the charts, it also sold a couple million copies).  With flawlessly-constructed production and a set tuneful songs, MIRAGE stands as one of the ultimate high gloss pop recordings.  On a side note, the MIRAGE album cover is also particularly attractive and enchanting.
B0006HXXBA|5.0|Notice the title, I used not one but TWO songs from the album to kreate it (stupid pun); I am cool.<br /><br />For starters boys and girls let me get something out of my system - Virushan is a complete idiot and probably didn't even listen to the album in question. At least, I hope he did not, because if he did he is even more of an idiot than I am giving him credit for being. Now that I have that off of my chest let me actually get this so called review rolling. For those of you who are not in the know or are new to this wonderful genre called 'metal', Kreator are sort of a big deal in thrash metal circles. These German titans of thrash have released several quality albums through out the years, many I personally own. \\"Enemy of God\\" is their latest effort, and honestly, I was half way thinking Kreator would fall flat on their face with this album and follow the trend started by a lot of other good metal bands and decided it would be cool to suck it up. But, me-o-my, how I was surprised! Kreator still have it in them. They may not be as thrashy or fast as they used to be, but they have been around for nearly twenty years. I would much prefer bands to attempt change and try different styles instead of continuing to release the same ol' same ol' year after year. As I stated before, this album is not as fast as previous releases and actually is more of a hybrid of thrash combined with more melody...a lot of melody actually, and there is nothing wrong with that. Many of the songs are down right catchy and chocked full of riffs. The guitarists are riff monsters and can shred! Though the solos may not be the most technical out there they are very respectable and hold their own, and bottom line, are enjoyable to listen to, and is not that what matters most? As far as vocals go they have a certain aggressiveness and assertiveness to them and are semi-raspy. Seems to be either you love 'em or hate them; I like them a lot. Most of the lyrical content is typical thrash material: end of the world, death, war, ancient plagues, etc. Again, not supremely great but very good and enough variation on the central them to keep things interesting. Pumping through the mix is the bass. Having bass that is audible on a metal CD is not always the easiest feat to accomplish, so that gives you some sort of idea for the quality of production on \\"Enemy of God\\". The drums are nice, classic thrash, resplendent with pounding double kick drum rhythms. So it appears I must be traveling onward friends and fellow metal heads, so let me just sum things up by saying this is a great release by the masters of German thrash. Enough of the old mixed with enough new material to kreate just the right amount of sonic destruction. Pick it up new and old fans alike; you will not be disappointed.f the world, death, war, ancient plagues, etc. Again, not supremely great but very good and enough variation on the central them to keep things interesting.

B000002KLZ|4.0|Still smarting from the negative reception that Tusk received from many fans and critics, the Mac decided to release a live album of their previous hits to remind fans of why they became so successful in the first place.  A whopping 10 of the double album's 18 tracks come from 1975's FLEETWOOD MAC and 1977's RUMOURS, with \\"Sara,\\" \\"Over and Over,\\" and \\"Not That Funny\\" standing in as the only songs to represent 1979's underrated masterpiece TUSK.  Still, there are a few surprises, including a stunning cover of Peter Green's \\"Oh Well\\" and a rare performance of \\"Don't Let Me Down Again,\\" a stellar number form Buckingham Nicks' long out-of-print debut album.   <br /> <br />There are also two newly-written songs, which will be of interest to fans.  Christine McVie contributes the lovely ballad \\"One More Night,\\" which is yet another beautiful, bittersweet ballad, very much in the same vein as much of her melancholy material on TUSK.  Stevie's new composition \\"Fireflies\\" (#60 Pop, #59 Mainstream Rock) is a groovy mid-tempo rocker, that many of Nicks' fans will no doubt buy this record especially for -  although the song was not a hit, it was a charting single, and it has yet to appear on any other album.  There is also a terrific backstage recording the Beach Boys' \\"The Farmer's Daughter,\\" which highlights the groups gorgeous harmonies at the peak of their strength. <br /> <br />Live albums are a sometimes a tough sell, as they are often routine and predictable.  This one is one of my favorites, however, as it contains raw and energetic performances that are a nice counterpart to the heavily-produced studio versions.  In particular, \\"Rhiannon,\\" \\"Don't Stop,\\" \\"I'm So Afraid,\\" and especially \\"Go Your Own Way\\" all rock harder than ever, brimming forth with an almost carnal energy that becomes intoxicating.  The set's ballads like \\"Sara\\" and \\"Over and Over\\" also seem to strike stronger emotional chords in the live setting, with Stevie's tattered rendition of \\"Landslide\\" emerging as especially moving; it sounds as though she's literally experiencing the lyrics right in front of your own ears.   <br /> <br />On the downside, the material isn't always very well recorded (the mastering of live albums has come a long way since then), and all of the tracks come from different concert dates spliced together, but this device actually works surprisingly well as it gives listeners a well rounded view of the overall tour.  I do wonder why the original two record set is presented on two compact discs, when, at about 80 minutes, it could have fit on one CD by editing only a couple seconds.  This is a minor nitpick, however, as the album remains an amazing document of one of the all-time great bands at the top of it's game.  The album was also a commercial success,  peaking at #14 on the Hot 200, which is a great showing for a live recording.
B00005JPBP|4.0|The Prestige is introduced with the basic elements of magic. Like the structure of most storytelling, there is a beginning, a middle and an end but instead it is called the Pledge, the Turn and finally, the Prestige. <br /> <br />The Prestige follows this structure...but not in sequence. Instead, most of the film is told in flashbacks through diaries, introducing the characters at the Turn of the trick and the movie before moving back to the Pledge with the two Victorian magicians at the beginnings of their relationship and rivalry. From that rivalry, a story is told that explores the depths these characters will go in order to keep the secrets that come with their profession and their obsession with learning each other's secrets in order to become the superior magician. While the reveal of their secrets, the Prestige, can be predicted, it doesn't make the reveal or the anticipation any less satisfying. <br /> <br />The film has an impressive cast, led by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale as the rival magicians, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden. With two likeable leading men it was difficult to choose which character should come out as the winner of their rivalry or if either one should or even could. The characters' very different personalities undergo dramatic shifts, varying from charming to sinister, as they seek out their goals, needs change and secrets are revealed. The performances of both actors add greater depth and mystery to their characters, making them either more sympathetic or more suspicious depending on the event, the point of view or the reveal. With two such intense characters, Cutter, played by the legendary Michael Caine, puts the need for secrets in perspective as their guide and mentor while adding another, more objective view of the rivalry between the two magicians.  <br /> <br />Adapted for the screen by Jonathan and Christopher Nolan and directed by Christopher Nolan, the flashbacks could make it difficult to keep track of the timeline, however that turns out not to be the case. Although the direction is at times a little heavy-handed and deliberate, it is also beautifully filmed with tones, sets and costumes that enhance the era of the story.  <br /> <br />As with any magic trick, it's a little disappointing to have the secret of the trick fully revealed. That is also the case with The Prestige. However, it would be more disappointing if the secrets were left unknown. It's a gripping movie, filled with intense emotions that come from mystery, suspense, drama, romance and rivalry which make the journey extremely satisfying.
B00009RAJI|5.0|What is left to say about this album?  One of the biggest sellers of all time (18 million copies and counting have been sold), RUMOURS proved that musicians can make an album that is an enormous success both commercially and artistically.  The story of the group's two sets of couples ending their respective relationships while in the process of creating the album is well-documented and shall not be recounted here.  So much attention has been paid to the soap opera-esque theatrics of the group members' personal lives at the time that the quality of the actual music contained on the disc can often be somewhat shortchanged.  Simply put, even when divorced from the real-life drama that surrounded it's writing and recording, RUMOURS is a truly exceptional album that remains one of the milestones of the singer/songwriter era. <br /> <br />All three of the group's principal songwriters are very nearly at the peak of their powers on this album.  Once again, Christine McVie offers up a set of tuneful and compelling pop numbers.  Christine offers one of her most delicious hooks on the sly hit \\"You Make Lovin' Fun\\" (#9 Pop), which effectively sets Stevie and Lindsey's amazing harmony vocals against a killer refrain and one of Christine's most soulful lead performances.  The eerie \\"Oh Daddy\\" also makes fantastic use of the group's incredibly tight harmonies, and is perhaps the most chilling number that the usually upbeat McVie ever wrote.  On the complete opposite end of the spectrum from the sparse \\"Oh Daddy,\\" Christine also penned the delightful smash \\"Don't Stop\\" (#3 Pop), a jubilant ditty that could bring a smile to even the most hardened cynic.  The best of McVie's material, however, is the heartbreaking \\"Songbird,\\" a genuinely touching ballad that avoids schmaltz with a healthy dose of restraint and sincerity.  It has remained a staple of Mac concerts since the release of this record. <br /> <br />RUMOURS finds Fleetwood Mac's other grand songstress in top form too.  Stevie Nicks' provided the group with two of the previous record's most memorable songs (\\"Rhiannon\\" and \\"Landslide), and this time she goes one step further and gives the group it's biggest hit ever with the ethereal mid-tempo rock ballad \\"Dreams\\" (#1 Pop).  Nicks' haunting melody and poetic lyrics combine with John McVie's dementedly thumping bass line to create a surreal masterpiece, and it is perhaps best described as the aural equivalent of a Van Gogh painting.  Stevie's irresistible pop confection \\"I Don't Want to Know\\" is so uncharacteristically lighthearted and sunny that it sounds like her version of the type of song that Christine typically writes.  This attempt at up-tempo pop is so surprisingly successful that I'd actually like to hear Stevie tackle this type of song more often.  Nicks' final solo contribution is the sobering album closer, the powerful cocaine-inspired opus \\"Gold Dust Woman.\\"  Though never officially released as a single, \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" is yet another song that has justifiably became a concert staple and it is now commonly regarded as one of Nicks' finest compositions. <br />  <br />In addition to his increasingly active role in producing the album, Lindsey Buckingham also once again makes a lasting impression as both a songwriter and vocalist.  In addition to providing a memorable duet vocal opposite Christine on \\"Don't Stop,\\" Buckingham also contributes three solo compositions, all of which rank among his best work.  The seemingly chipper \\"Second Hand News\\" effectively uses it's frenetic arrangement and instantly memorable chorus to undercut the pain and bitterness in the lyrics.  This device creates a powerful juxtaposition that brings added depth to each and every line of the lyrics.  The basically acoustic \\"Never Going Back Again\\" is a sputtering folk ballad that gains strength from it's refreshing simplicity, which isn't something that typically found in the majority of Buckingham's work.  Obviously the best of Buckingham's solo material on RUMOURS is the immortal \\"Go Your Own Way\\" (#10 Pop), an angry and angst-ridden rocker with a blistering guitar solo and an unbeatable hook.  It's probably my favorite cut on an album overflowing with highlights, and zero filler.    <br /> <br />All five of the band's members had a hand in writing \\"The Chain,\\" a mammoth cut that serves as the centerpiece of both RUMOURS and the band's entire career.  With moody versus and abstract lyrics that break away into a fist-thumping chorus and whirlwind fade out, \\"The Chain\\" combines the very best elements of each member of this particular lineup of the group.  While this merging of talents literally comes to a head on the \\"The Chain,\\" it is evidenced and echoed throughout the entire album.  At the time of the creation of RUMOURS, Fleetwood Mac was a band of five very distinct individuals who could somehow play together as one.
B000HCO840|4.0|My focal point of this review is not necessarily to review the movie.  I'm sure you have more than enough information from all the reviews presently underneath this title.<br /><br />When I purchased X-Men - The Last Stand (Stan Lee Collector's Edition) I was under the impression that there were alternate endings in this special presentation DVD .  I concluded that this meant, more than one version of the movie was on this special edition dvd --that cost approximately $10.00 more than the regular dvd standard version.  In essence, isn't that what Alternate ending suppose to mean?<br /><br />Well, in the Marvel World it seems \\"Alternate ending\\" means \\"deleted scenes\\". Scenes that never made it to the big screen.  There is only ONE movie on this dvd and a few deleted scenes with a crappy comic book that is suppose to justify the reason to charge you $10.00  more.<br /><br />Be forewarned, purchase X-men- The last stand.  It is a good movie, don't bother with the Stan Lee Collectors edition.  A waste of your hard, earned money.
B000002L9Y|4.0|This is the Mac's fifth and (so far) last studio effort with all five of the band's most popular members, and it was the last time that Lindsey Buckingham would record in the studio with the band for 16 years.  The album was a considerable success, peaking at lucky #7 on the Hot 200, selling two-million copies in the US, and spawning four hit singles.  Overall, quite an impressive showing for an aging supergroup well into it's second decade of performing together.  While it certainly does not rank among the classic Mac albums from the Buckingham/Nicks era of the band, it does remains a excellent recording that sent the most popular lineup of the band out on a high note. <br /> <br />As with TUSK and MIRAGE, TANGO IN THE NIGHT is primarily a showcase for Lindsey Buckingham's talents as a producer and arranger.  He consistently provides an arresting performance as a producer, and manages to flesh out and strengthen the songs of Mac's other two principal writers.  Buckingham is also a top-notch singer and songwriter in his own right as well.  The material he contributes to TANGO IN THE NIGHT is all first rate, and he's in great shape vocally.  The primal cries of \\"Caroline,\\" the clipped rhythm of \\"Family Man\\" (#83 Pop), and the sexy smash hit \\"Big Love\\" (#5 Pop, #23 Adult Contemporary, #2 Mainstream Rock, #7 Dance) all sit comfortable with his best work, and his bizarre title track is really the only truly TUSK-esque cutting edge track present on this album.   <br /> <br />The always endearing Christine McVie continues her irresistible blend of pop and blue-eyed soul, and contributes two big hits with \\"Little Lies\\" (#4 Pop, #1 Adult Contemporary, #14 Mainstream Rock) and \\"Everywhere\\" (#14 Pop, #1 Adult Contemporary, #22 Mainstream Rock).  The delirious smash \\"Little Lies\\" was the biggest hit off the album, and it remains a 24-karat classic of eighties pop.  Though the arrangement relies heavily on synthesizers and other late-eighties production gimmicks, the song actually sounds more pleasantly nostalgic than hopelessly dated.  \\"Little Lies\\" also has one of the most instantly memorable choruses that McVie ever penned, and the harmony vocals make effective use of all three of the band's vocalists.  Similarly, the heavy synths never become intrusive on McVie's \\"Everywhere,\\" which also remains a true slice of pop perfection - even though the gurgled voices at the end was probably one step too far.   <br /> <br />However, the absolute best material of the disc comes in the form of the three Buckingham-Christine McVie collaborations.  The super-sensual \\"Mystified\\" has an irresistible aura of jazzy coolness that brings out the sophisticated elegance of McVie's distinctive alto singing voice.  Conversely, the pulsating up-tempo stunner \\"Isn't It Midnight\\" (#14 Mainstream Rock) gives McVie one of her few chances to really rock out, while Lindsey's haunting background vocals provide a memorable counterpoint to McVie's uncharacteristically impassioned performance.  The concluding, almost neo-samba \\"You And I, Pt. 2\\" is great fun, with Lindsey giving an unusually jubilant lead vocal.  There's just something about these three Buckingham/McVie collaborations that merge the best qualities of both artists.  Christine's sophisticated pop song-craft balances out Lindsey's odd extremities, while Lindsey avant garde inventiveness minimalizes Christine's occasional blandness.  I'd really love to hear these two do a whole album together. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, not everything even comes close to working as well.  The only real downside to TANGO IN THE NIGHT is the surprisingly poor quality of Stevie Nicks' material.  The derivative \\"Welcome To The Room. . . Sara\\" is probably her best offering here, even though it's basically a rehash of her own superior 1981 composition \\"Blue Lamp\\" (included on the HEAVY METAL soundtrack album).  Still, \\"Welcome to the Room\\" is at least listenable.  Stevie contributed \\"additional lyrics\\" to the Sandy Stewart-penned hit \\"Seven Wonders\\" (#19 Pop, #13 Adult Contemporary, #2 Mainstream Rock), which finds Nicks pandering too much to the pop audience in order to snag a hit.  Worst of all is  the embarrassingly undistinguished \\"When I See You Again,\\" which finds her in the worst voice of her entire career.  There is something uncomfortably disturbing about listening to Stevie's tattered vocals on this cut.  It's like hearing a singer completely fall apart right before your very ears.  Thank God Lindsey took over the vocals at the end of the song before the track became too unbearable to listen to.   <br /> <br />In the end, TANGO IN THE NIGHT is a great album with top notch material and performances from Lindsey Buckingham and Christine McVie.  Unfortunately, the poor quality of Stevie Nicks' solo contributions keeps it from reaching it full potential.  With some decent material from Nicks, would TANGO IN THE NIGHT have become the eighties pop equivalent to 1977's RUMOURS or 1979's TUSK?  Maybe, but, as it stands, TANGO IN THE NIGHT is still a great record and a must-own for Mac fans.
B000INAXHE|5.0|With this double Compact Disc, Jamiroquai will say goodbye to Sony Music for good and move to another label. He already created a label called Long Lost Brother but it collapsed a few years ago. I wish him luck in his endeavours, but let's be honest, without the marketing structure of Sony Music it's going to be hard for him to sell his new material. My advice? Move to Universal Music Group, so he can share the payroll with James Brown, GAP Band and Stevie Wonder.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Fleetwood Mac returned once again in the fall of 2003, and not a moment too soon.  The current pop/rock scene had been such a vast wasteland of commercialized nonentities that an album of refreshing, complex, and adult popular music was just what the doctor ordered.  The re-addition of Lindsey Buckingham (his first studio album the band since 1987) and Stevie Nicks (her first since 1990) into the fold seems to have rejuvenated the old hit machine, and their knack for crafting memorable, hook-filled pop/rock (brimming with thoughtful lyrics, melodic surprises, and impossibly tight harmonies) remains firmly intact.  Only the absence of longtime hit-maker Christine McVie prevents SAY YOU WILL from being a full throttle reunion, but Buckingham and Nicks almost have enough songs and ideas to fill the void. <br /> <br />It had been over a decade since Buckingham's last solo album (1992's criminally underrated OUT OF THE CRADLE), and his contributions to SAY YOU WILL prove that his immeasurable talents as a producer, singer, songwriter, and guitarist have not diminished in the least.  I personally feel that the near-epic rock opus \\"Come\\" sounds a little too similar to Buckingham's own 1992 composition \\"This is the Time\\" (from OUT OF THE CRADLE), but the rest of his material is first-rate.  The revved rockers \\"What's the World Coming To\\" and \\"Peacekeeper\\" sit down perfectly next to the eccentric masterpieces \\"Murrow Turning Over in His Grave,\\" \\"Miranda,\\" and \\"Red Rover,\\" which are certainly the most refreshingly avant-garde tracks that the band has recorded since 1979's TUSK.  Buckingham's tracks are always tuneful and surprising, with the genteel \\"Steal Your Heart Away,\\" a studio version of the beautiful \\"Bleed to Love Her\\" (originally performed during THE DANCE tour), and the bittersweet ballad \\"Say Goodbye\\" all ranking among the best compositions in his long career. <br /> <br />Stevie Nicks has been more active than Buckingham in her recent career, although her work onSAY YOU WILL is no less impressive.  Nicks delivers a couple of her trademark incoherent musings with \\"Illume\\" and \\"Smile at You,\\" both of which become instantly memorable due to the passion and urgency in which they are performed.  Nicks' immediately likeable title track is super-slick, her \\"Throw Down\\" is a fun mid-tempo number in the same vein as 1982's \\"Gypsy,\\" and she also delivers two beautiful new ballads with \\"Silver Girl\\" and \\"Goodbye Baby.\\"  The best of Nicks' material, however, are the rockers \\"Everybody Finds Out,\\" \\"Destiny Rules,\\" and the fantastic \\"Running Through the Garden,\\" all of which allow the singer to rock out in a way she hasn't done since 1981's \\"Edge of Seventeen.\\" <br /> <br />If there is a problem with the album, it would be that it never really seems to merge as a whole as much as I would like it too.  For example, the album TUSK was all over the map, but it still managed to pull together into a cohesive unit.  Nearly all of the tunes on SAY YOU WILL are terrific and the album's pacing and sequencing work far better than I initially suspected, but I still can't help but wish that Buckingham and Nicks had collaborated a bit more together on at least a couple tracks for unity's sake.  And that is definitely where Christine McVie is missed the most, as her consistently calm material was quite often the glue that held it all together. <br /> <br />Still, SAY YOU WILL is easily one of the best albums of the decade.  Fans responded to the disc, sending it all the way to #3 on the Hot 200.  It was quickly certified Gold in sales.
0618680004|5.0|Ironically, as an ardent and lifelong searcher, practitioner, thinker and student of Eastern Philosophy, Western mystery schools, Comparative Religion and World mythology I arrived quite separately at the same conclusion as Dr. Dawkins, and other au current scientist/atheist/activists as Sam Harris and Daniel Dennett.  <br /> <br />It is painfully obvious that humankind has reached its collective tipping point concerning the \\"god delusion\\" and other antiquated belief systems, and must now act vigorously to counter their oppressive hold over the human psyche. As Robert Oxton Bolt writes, \\"A belief is not merely an idea the mind possesses; it is an idea that possesses the mind.\\" <br /> <br />I do feel it necessary to caution us not to throw the proverbial baby of imagination and myth out with the dingy bath water of ignorance, dogma and obduracy. My own personal experience informs me that myth remains one of the great paths to personal evolution and expanded awareness, or, as the great Bard has offered, \\"We are such stuff that dreams are made on\\".  However great our powers of ratiocination, it is, also our ability to dream, imagine and mythologize that makes us uniquely human. When we start factualizing, moralizing and legislating on those beliefs is where the trouble begins. Alan Watts put it succinctly in The Wisdom of Insecurity when he wrote \\"The great tragedy of Christianity is its obsession with what was true once as opposed to what is true always.\\" (paraphrased)
B00009RAJJ|5.0|An ambitious and often misunderstood recording, TUSK is possibly the Mac's most rewarding effort - even if it's not as accessible as the band's other records.  The critics hated it and after selling 18 million records and spending over 30 weeks at #1 with RUMOURS, TUSK's sales of 4 million copies and \\"only\\" hitting #4 on the Hot 100 was considered a big disappointment.  Originally released as a mammoth, seventy minute-plus double record set, Tusk is anything but commercial.  I will always argue, however, that this usual experiment is the best work that the members of any lineup of Fleetwood Mac were ever involved with.  Heck, I will even go as far to argue that TUSK is one of the greatest recordings of the rock era, period. <br /> <br />Stevie Nicks turns in five of her very best compositions to the album, and, for the most part, she seems to have been in a highly introspective mood.  She penned the set's biggest hit single, the nearly seven-minute mini-opus \\"Sara\\" (#7 Pop), which explores some very personal subject matter in a poetic and ambiguous manner - all while seducing the listener with an irresistibly hypnotic groove.  Nicks also plays up her mystic persona on the intoxicating \\"Sisters of the Moon,\\" which can send chills down the listener's spine like an unexpected gush of wind.  Stevie even flirts with moderately hard rock on the intense \\"Angel,\\" which works it's driving melody to the fullest extent in addition to laying down an instantly memorable refrain.   <br /> <br />The best of Nicks' material, however, are the gorgeous, refreshingly unsentimental ballads \\"Storms\\" and \\"Beautiful Child.\\"  Stevie has commonly been described by fans and critics as a the perpetual woman/child, always just one the verge of reaching full maturity - she is destined to reach for the sky, yet is doomed to walk the earth.  This unusual predicament has left Nicks with tremendous gift for crafting songs with universal themes that still manage to carry a unique edge.  This is exactly what allows the very best of Nicks' to stand out from the compositions that other writers have been churning out for centuries.  \\"Storms\\" and \\"Beautiful Child\\" are perfect examples of this, and both songs arguably remain her finest song-writing achievements. <br /> <br />Perhaps the stereotypical woes of sudden stardom are to blame, but, as with Stevie Nicks, TUSK also finds Christine McVie in a somber, soul-searching mood.  Fortunately, this suits the longtime Mac muse well, and her dark husky voice has seldom sounded more beautifully pained.  In fact, the McVie-penned opening number, the mournful \\"Over and Over,\\" is actually what sets the pace for the entire double record set.  The song, which is an extremely rare exception of a cry of desperation that never sounds pathetic or self-pitying, is an absolute tour de force for McVie, and lets listeners know that the band had no intention of simply recreating RUMOURS.  It with some irony then that McVie also contributes the most RUMOURS-esque cut on the album.  The blaring mid-tempo rocker \\"Think About Me\\" (#20 Pop) is the closest thing tusk has to bright AOR of RUMOURS, but even it has slightly dark edge that separates it from the polished pop of the previous record.   <br /> <br />After those first two compositions, the bulk of the tracks penned by McVie are featured on the last half of the album.  In addition to \\"Over and Over\\" and \\"Think About Me\\" (which are both sequenced near the very beginning of the record), Christine also delivers the intense ballad \\"Brown Eyes,\\" the elegant folk of \\"Honey Hi\\" and \\"Never Forget,\\" which plays like an homage to the very best pop of the Brill Building era.  While all of Christine's material is remarkably solid (as is the rest of the disc's material), my absolute favorite McVie-penned track on the album (along with the aforementioned \\"Over and Over\\") is the heartbreaking piano ballad \\"Never Make Me Cry.\\"  The tender simplicity in the arrangement, melody, and lyrics combine seamlessly with the gorgeous melancholy in McVie's voice to create a haunting hymn to neglected love that resonates in the mind long after the track has ended.        <br /> <br />Lindsey Buckingham really took control over the recording, with his name even signaled out from the rest of the band members as a \\"special thanks\\" on the production credit.  In addition to creating amazing sonic landscapes for the material by Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie, Buckingham also delivers nine original compositions that are nervy, frantic, and fantastic.  The lean, fist-thumping rock numbers \\"The Ledge,\\" \\"What Makes You Think You're the One,\\" and \\"Not That Funny\\" each have a primal energy that seems to radiate through the speakers.  Each of these tracks have a stripped-down, blistering urgency that leaves the band sounding more like tried-and-true rockers rather than pampered MOR superstars who are recording the followup to a massive success. <br /> <br />TUSK also allows Buckingham to pay homage to many of his own early influences and musical heros.  He seems to channel Buddy Holly on the rootsy rockers \\"That's Enough for Me\\" and \\"I Know I'm Not Wrong,\\" while the lush, tight harmonies of \\"Save Me a Place\\" and \\"Walk a Thin Line\\" both rival even the very best of the Beach Boys.  Impressive variety is present in all of Buckingham's tracks, which are all arranged and performed with a wide assortment of surprises and unexpected turns.  On one end of the spectrum is the soft tones of the somewhat distressful \\"That's All for Everyone,\\" while the thunderous stampede of the avant garde title track (#8 Pop) is on the clear opposite end. <br /> <br />Though commonly thought of as a failure, or at least a commercial disappointment, TUSK represents Fleetwood Mac taking a huge commercial and artistic chances and emerging with one of the greatest achievements of the rock era.
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|Def Leppard has never been able to climb past the commercial or creative success they achieved with Hysteria.  Some might argue that Pyromania was their finest effort.  Truth is, Hysteria was the record that made them a success not only in thier home country of England, but also broke them to a worldwide audience like no other hard-rock/ heavy metal act before them. <br /> <br />This Hysteria Deluxe Edition puts that whole era in perspective, with the inclusion of live B-sides, studio outtakes, and extended remixes of their  succesful singles.  Disc One brings together the original album and the studio b-sides while Disc Two is an additional disc of all the B-sides off the 7 (yes, count them, SEVEN) singles released to promote the record.  Four of those B-sides come on the first disc, and the idea works well, because those songs are actually studio outtakes that did not make the final cut.  Therefore, their presence here only adds to what they were working on at the time.  Of particular interest is Ride Into The Sun, off their independent debut EP which they re-recorded in 1987. <br /> <br />The second disc starts with several LIVE versions of 5 songs (Elected, Love and Affection, Billy's Got a Gun, Rock of Ages, Women) and goes on to include remixes for ANIMAL (extended version), POUR SOME SUGAR ON ME (extended version), ARMAGEDDON IT (The Nuclear Mix), EXCITABLE (Orgasmic Mix), ROCKET (The Lunar Mix).  It is important to mention that while Rock of Ages has the same name as their famous song off Pyromania, the version here is actually a medley including parts of the classic rock anthems \\"Not Fade Away,\\" \\"My Generation,\\" \\"Radar Love,\\" \\"Come Together\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\". <br /> <br />Finally to close the second disc they have included another studio b-side, a humorous version of \\"Release Me,\\" credited to Stumpus Maximus & The Good Ol' Boys.  Which proves that Def Leppard and particularly Hysteria might not be the most serious music ever made, but they were indeedserious about having fun.
B000002LFZ|3.0|GREATEST HITS does a fine job of assembling the bulk of the Mac's hits from their 1975-1987 heyday, including some of the best pop/rock songs of all time.  \\"Go Your Own Way,\\" \\"Rhiannon,\\" \\"Say That You Love Me,\\" \\"Big Love,\\" \\"Gypsy,\\" \\"Little Lies,\\" and countless others are as relevant and as compelling as ever.  All of the tracks are presented in their original album versions, including the full-length version of the hit \\"Sara,\\" which has been inexplicably replaced by a single edit on some CD issues of TUSK.<br /><br />The only real faults with this disc are the half hazard song sequencing (all compilations should be presented in chronological order to preserve the right momentum) and the absence of several good tracks.  The missing songs, including a few hits (\\"Think About Me,\\" \\"Love In Store,\\" and \\"Seven Wonders\\") and some popular album tracks (\\"Monday Morning,\\" \\"The Chain,\\" \\"What Makes You Think You're the One\\"), would have brought more diversity to the set and fleshed things out a little more.  Also, the MIRAGE track \\"Oh Diane\\" is still one of the group's biggest hits in the UK, although it's also missing.<br /><br />Two new songs are added - the rocker \\"No Questions Asked\\" (#37 Mainstream Rock) and the glossy semi-hit \\"As Long As You Follow\\" (#43 Pop, #1 Adult Contemporary, #15 Mainstream Rock).  These two tracks are the first recordings released since Lindsey Buckingham stepped out of the band and was replaced with Rick Vito and Billy Burnette.  \\"As Long As You Follow\\" features a terrific vocal from Christine, but it is an otherwise predictable power ballad.  Though Nicks' \\"No Questions Asked\\" is more energetic, it's also more cluttered and unfocused.<br /><br />Due to the previous lack of solid compilations of this era of the group (there wasn't a more definitive compilation of the 1975-1987 years until 2002), this album sold over 8 million copies in the US alone.  While I personally recommend that listeners explore the Mac's five studio albums with Buckingham and Nicks (all five of which are each more satisfying listens than this record), GREATEST HITS will do the job for the most casual fans who only want the biggest hits.uckingham and Nicks (all five of which are each more satisfying listens than this record), GREATEST HITS will do the job for the most casual fans who only want the biggest hits.
B00005B4GU|5.0|i had began working with a huge radiohead fan a few weeks before this came out.  aside from creep, which i always thought was ok, i never really heard them.  i was an 18 year old, rage against the machine kinda kid.  so when this came out i bought it, along with kid a and ok computer.  though they were all great, i was especially hooked on amnesiac.  i sorta get why so many people hate this one, but then i don't.  i guess ya just have to be the kinda person who can see past the poppy, bouncy westernized, force-fed corprate music.   <br />i spent basically the rest of that summer and fall, on my bed, with no lights but a strobing blacklight, pen and paper, and this cd along with tool's live disc looped.  i wrote alot of dark stuff that needed to come out, and ultimatly helped me become a more rounded person.  so i guess what i'm sayin is this is one of those things ya really feel, more than ya hear.  all ya gotta do is stop and feel.
B00009RAJH|5.0|The self-titled debut of the most popular lineup of Fleetwood Mac remains as fresh and enjoyable as the day it was first released.  Before this album's release, the average Fleetwood Mac record sold around 300,000 copies.   To the shock of everyone, this album spent months on the Hot 200, eventually hitting #1 and selling over 5 million copies - more than all of the group's previous recordings combined.  However, with the addition of Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks to the lineup, the record truly had the sound of new band at work.  The overall sound is very much in the mold of most mid-seventies California rock, which gives the record a nice unity.  Even though it is the first record for this particular lineup, the band had already perfected the eclectic sound that they are best known for.   <br /> <br />Buckingham's early prominence in the producer's chair is largely responsible for the band's abrupt switch from old-school blues to progressive pop/rock.  Buckingham also demonstrates his talents as a skilled vocalist on his impressive rendition of Michael Curtis' \\"Blue Letter\\" (the only track here not written by either Buckingham, Nicks, or Christine McVie), and a lovely reading of Nicks' \\"Crystal.\\"  This particular song had been previously recorded on the long-out-print Buckingham-Nicks album, and Lindsey's delicate performance will make you wish he would cover more of Nicks' material.  The two numbers solely penned by Buckingham are also exceptionally tight.  The energetic \\"Monday Morning\\" has an unbeatably catchy melody, while the mini-anthem \\"I'm So Afraid\\" hints at the paranoid brilliance that would fully emerge in many of Buckingham's later compositions.     <br /> <br />Similarly, Stevie Nicks' somehow seems to have already tapped into her full potential as a songwriter and delivers two total classics right out of the box.  In addition to the aforementioned \\"Crystal,\\" Nicks contributes the riveting hit \\"Rhiannon\\" (#11 Pop) and the mournful \\"Landslide,\\" and both remain two of her finest achievements.  Not surprisingly, the mystical \\"Rhiannon\\" became one of Nicks' best-loved signature songs almost instantly after it's release, and it remains the most fondly-remembered of this album's 11 tracks.  On the other hand, the uncharacteristically straightforward \\"Landslide\\" was never officially released as single, yet it has become as popular as anything the Mac ever recorded.  It is now considered a tried-and-true classic, popularized through years of concert performances and cover versions.  Nicks' wrenching performance, however, is the definitive rendition of the song.     <br /> <br />Even more impressive, however, this album marks the final transformation of Christine McVie from a charmingly pleasant songwriter and vocalist into one of the greatest pure-pop craftswomen of her generation.  On all previous Mac recordings, Christine was largely kept in the background with a limited number of songs making the final cut.  Finally on this recording, she is given ample room to showcase her talents, and she responds with some of the finest pop recordings of the seventies.  McVie displays her gift for fine-tuning expertly-crafted lyrics and melodies on the gorgeous hit \\"Over My Head\\" (#20 Pop), and the stirring \\"Warm Ways\\" demonstrates the irresistible way in which her lovely alto embodies a lyric.  McVie also turns in the surprisingly sensual \\"Sugar Daddy\\" and the delightful \\"Say That You Love Me\\" (#11 Pop), both of which are perfect examples of the polished pop she is famous for.  The searing \\"World Turning,\\" a then-rare collaboration between McVie and Buckingham, actually comes close to monumental sound of the classic Mac and is the stunning climax to this recording.   <br /> <br />While Fleetwood Mac isn't as highly regarded 1977's even more massively successful Rumours, it is really on the same level as that masterpiece.  It was recorded in considerably less time than Rumours would eventually be, and is therefore more roughsounding and less polished than that later album, which may actually be a preferable quality to some listeners.  Either way, you can't go wrong with a record that features three exceptionally strong singers and songwriters working at near peak capacity.  Although this album was highly successful, nothing could prepare the Mac for what they would achieve with their next record.
B000AADYYO|5.0|With the addition of Per Weiberg this adds more of a permenant piece to the Opeth puzzle. This is possibly one of the bands that you can't place in a single genre. The album was what I expected from Mikael and company. The riff's and arrangements are wonderful and his vocals are just as good as in any of there previous releases. Mixing the clean and brutal vocals is what makes this band unique besides as well as the music it's self. Having signed with Roadrunner Records before the album was released many figured the band would go south and become a bit more...pop. Far from it actually and if you ever get to see them live. Do it there just as tight as they are on disk.     Though with the loss of Martin Lopez and the addition of one of Sweden's best drummers Martin Axenrot this band is turning more into a super group that can actually create good music. There new album I do hope (I don't think I'll be let down) will be as good as anything they have written. But with a line up like this. How could it not be?
1904920209|4.0|I have been baking for about 8 years now, on and off, and for the most part eschewed the simple straight doughs in favor of more complex sourdoughs, or poolish starters (making a mini-dough several hours to 1-day before mixing the dough and adding it to improve flavor.)<br /><br />What so many bread books can't teach you is how to knead. Nancy Silverton's Breads from La Brea Bakery comes closest in explaining the technique, and emphasizing extremely important steps such as resting, to let the flour absorb water on its own. But there is always something lacking in a written description (and this from a writer).<br /><br />My perennial problem with bread though was an inability to get enough air into the dough to create what I call uneven bubble structure, the sort that the best artisan bakeries achieve. The major contribution of Bertinet's book is that he shows you in the DVD how to trap air in the dough so that you get this uneven structure and an airy bubble-filled crumb. Although the DVD is a bit amateurish (too many shots of his head when we should be looking at the dough), it does show a great kneading tecnique of stretching the dough and trapping air that results in a great crumb. It also shows you what condition the dough should be in during different phases of kneading, such as soupy and gloopy at the outset and satiny and smooth toward the end. (This white dough recipe is also perfect for pizza).<br /><br />I have been following his white dough recipe (for experienced bakers, he uses 70-percent hydration), with a few adjustments. I think if you just make a straight water, yeast, flour, salt dough with a 1 hour rest, shaping and 1 hour rise, as he suggests, the dough will taste yeasty. So I've been making a flour/yeast/water poolish, letting it develop for about 3 hours before I mix the dough and add it in. Or I make a poolish with sourdough starter which really improves the flavor. Otherwise I follow his instructions. I generally use King Arthur All Purpose Flour, which is close in protein content to European bread flours. Also, I go for a slightly more hydrated dough, adding 2-3 tbs of water in the keading. This is my own preference for a slighly wetter dough, which leads to a looser crumb.<br /><br />This is the best book I've come across for novice bakers but I look forward to his second book for more experienced ones.Flour, which is close in protein content to European bread flours.

0783231202|5.0|All criticism aside, one of the most powerful statements against slavery and man's inhumanity towards his fellow man. It seems that when it comes to slavery and America's shameful past, we try to ignore that it ever happened. Too few films have portrayed the slave trade or the continued illegal slave trade, such as that of Spain's, that was still taking place then. No one wants to be reminded of that dark past, but we tend to stand tall concerning other issues, \\"lest we forget\\". And yes, Cinque was a man without a language in this foreign land, like any of us would have been. Hats off to Mr. Spielberg, for one of his most powerful works to date.
B000HBKCDC|3.0|Okay it should have been obvious had I bothered to look at the song list.  I didn't since I was thrilled to see the long awaited and much anticipated new Sarah McLachlin CD.   <br /> <br />My mistake.  Don't make the same mistake.  There are a few songs that make the CD worthwhile, Song for a Winter Night (from 1994), Wintersong and Christmas Time is Here,  but generally there is not much to recommend this CD.    <br /> <br />Back to waiting and anticipating.
B000F48D3C|5.0|If our best WWII movie is Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down is definitely the best modern day battle movie.  Black Hawk Down is able to capture everything involved in the incident that happened on that nice 3rd day of October.    I own both the original release and this Extended Cut edition DVDs.  The original version has a faster pace and this version is perfect for those who still want more of it.  Both versions are good but if you can only decide to keep one, keep the extended cut version.  I would say this extended cut version is even more worthy to collect than the 3 discs collector edition.
B000FZETIO|3.0|The Duckie edition of Pretty in Pink is not what it promises to be. It has great interviews, and extra features the original DVD release did not contain, but don't buy it to see Duckie and Andie get together. The promised \\"Alternate Ending\\" is not included on the DVD. Many fans say that we should all be satisfied with the original fairy tale ending.  I loved that theater ending, where the girl gets her Prince Charming. It is a great finale. <br />However, although I agree that it is a fairy tale, one possible happy ending to this fairy tale would be that the underdog, the boy who loved Andie (Duckie) gets the girl. His utter devotion to her happiness is evident in the theatrical version, where her happiness is so much more important to him than his own that he sends her off to the boy she dreams of.  It should make no difference if the actress does not feel genuine chemistry (an argument repeated many times in the DVD interviews)--that's what acting is about: pretending that which is not real. Good acting can make it appear that there is chemistry. We underdog/outcast-types don't feel the theater ending should be thrown out, we just want a chance to see the other possibility, to see Duckie get his wish, and for Andie to realize she loves him too. It was a real disappointment to see this package promise that little snippet of the alternate fantasy, only to have the special features tell us incessantly why it was a bad idea instead.  I did genuinely enjoy seeing the actors discuss their experiences on the set, and laugh at the debate over which ending they thought made the best sense. I would have bought the DVD for those interviews, but I was tricked into buying it for the Duckie ending. It is dishonest that this DVD does not contain the promised contents--even the title promises we will see Duckie prevail.
B000001GY9|5.0|I own the Szell recordings which finally convinced me that Schumann's symphonies were worth getting to know (Kubelik's readings on Sony just didn't do a thing for me), but listening to Bernstein's Schumann was like hearing an entirely different composer. I agree with another reviewer who wrote about his response to the Adagio in Symphony #2. Although I didn't have tears rolling down my face, it certainly grabbed me and wouldn't let go (Szell clocks-in at a little over 11 minutes; Bernstein over 13 - but its not overt indulgence like his Tchaikovsky 6th). It was like listening to Lenny's Concertgebouw Mahler 9th. It is wrenching. I wouldn't ever let go of Szell or Bernstein - both have much to say about this often maligned composer of symhonies.
B0000013G9|5.0|Despite the fact that my musical taste now ranges from Tim McGraw to OTEP I really grew up on the R&B and Hip Hop of the 90's.  Everything from SWV to TLC, Boyz II Men and Jodeci.  Matter of fact, my favorite album of my childhood would have to be `Crazy/Sexy/Cool' by TLC.  This album is really their definitive moment, capitalizing on T-Boz's sultry voice, Chilli's sex appeal and Left-Eye's (RIP) spunk and energy and delivering their most memorable and inspiring hits from the controversial `Waterfalls' to the guilty pleasure of `Creep'.  <br /> <br />Songs like `Red Light Special' and `Diggin on You' really set the mood right, T-Boz almost verbally stimulating us and getting us ready for anything.  Just thinking about this album makes me...um...so let's move on.  Another great mood setter is `Take Our Time' and the sultry `Lets do it Again'.  Not a huge fan of `Case of the Fake People' but that's just a minor low-point and they far then make up for it with songs like their classic cover of `If I was your Girlfriend' which they blow out of the water, and the great closer `Sumthin Wicked This Way Comes'.  All I can say is that `Creep' has to be the greatest TLC song, or possibly the greatest R&B track from the 90's period! <br /> <br />As far as the intros and interludes and skits are concerned, they just add weight to this album and give us a nice detour from this brilliant and wonderful musical experience.  I just don't know if it can get any better than `Crazy/Sexy/Cool'...
B000HT386M|4.0|This movie had plenty of wacky humor that I've grown to expect from Adam Sandler. That's why I watched it. I didn't expect the movie might have a universal theme I'd find important.<br /><br />But, it did have a strong message about living life in the company of those that love us, not our jobs. It reminded me of a modern day Dicken's Christmas Carol. They had the past, present and future \\"controlled\\" by the clicker. And there was Christopher Walken playing the (well, I won't ruin that).<br /><br />I liked the futuristic part of the movie the best. I enjoyed seeing the creator's vision of what that future might be like.
0800141660|5.0|The first time I saw this film I was about ten and I abhorred it.  I was bored.  I dismissed this film as one of those movies I'll never like, but then last year I was delighted when watching `Pride and Prejudice' and it hit me...I'm not ten anymore and I just might like these kinds of movies now.  So, I decided to give `Sense and Sensibility' a try and I was quickly set at ease for I became completely absorbed in this film.   <br /> <br />The film focuses on the Dashwood family, more notably the two eldest sisters Elinor (Emma Thompson) and Marianne (Kate Winslet).  We see their struggles to find true love and keep it and we're endeared towards them as their attempts at happiness are met with the harshest of resentment and persecution.  That's not to say that this isn't a happy and warm film, it's just sad to see what they must fight against, most notably their evil sister-in-law Fanny (Harriet Walter).  As Elinor struggles to provide for her family emotionally she shelters her own emotions and refuses to confide in anyone whereas Marianne is open in her emotions, very charismatic and almost selfish in her manner. <br /> <br />To me the acting is what really drives this movie home.  Both the leading women are great, but it's Kate who lifts this movie (and pretty much every movie she does) and causes it to soar above the rest.  Her Marianne is not only convincing but memorable.  In my humble opinion she deserved the Oscar.  Alan Rickman is also very good here as the gentleman Colonel Brandon who wants only the best for Marianne, and Greg Wise is every bit charming as he is despicable as Willoughby.  Now I'm not a fan of Hugh Grant, at least not a huge fan.  I much prefer his selfish play boy types like in `Two-Weeks Notice' and `About a Boy', so here I felt he was a bit miscast.  He works, just not wonderfully.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|Some people will dismiss this as a chick flick. But, it won't be just women that enjoy this story. For those men among you that aren't afraid of admitting that you enjoy romance, this a great movie to share with your loved one.<br /><br />This is one of the best new movies I've watched in a long time, because it was so un-Hollywood. The way this movie was directed reminded me of some of the dialogue in the movie. In one scene, Alex's father talks about how architects need to know their environment, they have pay attention to the light. To me it seemed Alejandro Agresti was paying attention to the environment. He wasn't just filming a movie, he was creating this movie the same way an architect can create beauty out of wood, glass and steel.<br /><br />This story has a paranormal element that can throw some viewers. This is not a movie about time travel. The story is about two alternative realities, and how the characters can't travel to each other (at least without Alex waiting for time to pass).<br /><br />But, more importantly, this story is really just a romance. To me it seemed as if the creators didn't even want the alternative realities to detract from that romance. They could have had more pizzaz than a mailbox flag flipping up and down to show two alternative realities. But, why have drastically shifting images and sounds like The Butterfly Effect did, when simple worked?<br /><br />Of course, there were some special effects that were interesting. But, this movie didn't have that Hollywood glitz that distracts from the human element. The Lake House was calm and quiet and romantic. It's hard to find that in the movie industry these days.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure that it was the direct, Alejandro Agresti, that played the guy with the breath freshener on the train. It was my favorite scene. I laughed so hard I had to back up and watch all the dialogue I missed. Thank goodness for DVD.
0618680004|4.0|One of the key arguments Dawkins makes in his book is (and I am paraphrasing here) that the assertion that God is an explanation for the complexity of our universe does not really explain much...because it does not explain the origin of the complexity that is God.    Several of the negative reviews posted here attack this as flawed logic, on various grounds. The essence of the protest is that (again paraphrasing) that something may exist that is \\"outside\\" of our universe or \\"outside\\" of our concept of time. And it could be more complex than we are, even if we can't understand how this is so.    I am still left to wonder how this helps much. I mean it is all well and good to answer the question: \\"How did the universe get created?\\" by saying it was created by something more complex than ourselves. But, to me, that still leaves the question of how the creator of our universe was created. Figuring out how to get out of this potentially endless chain is a bit like trying to understand infinity itself. Still, I am more than willing to concede that my wonderment is not tantamount to evidence one way or the other.    I believe Dawkins is on stronger grounds when he points out that, just because you can't disprove something, does not mean that it is just as likely to be true as any alternative. That is, just because one can't disprove that there are invisible aliens walking secretly among us, it does not mean that it is equally likely that there are aliens as there are not. In science, in such cases, the onus of responsibility is on the person making the positive assertion. That is, before the scientific community would accept the idea of aliens on our planet as reasonable, there would need to be solid evidence supporting it. Simply saying that you cannot disprove the existence of aliens is not sufficient evidence. Dawkins wants this same standard to be applied to the existence of God. Again, however, I understand how other people may argue that God is somehow outside of science and thus immune from this standard.    However, even if one were to concede that there are flaws in Dawkins' logic, or at least viable alternative viewpoints, this would in no way support the notion that a \\"creator of the universe\\" is anything like what many religious people regard as God. Just because the origin of the universe remains a mystery is no reason to assume that there must therefore be a God that provides our moral compass, that takes an interest in our actions, that has created an afterlife (heaven, hell or whatever), that may answer our prayers or punish us for our sins. And so on. There is similarly no reason to believe that the Bible or the Koran or any other religious document is anything other than a collection of stories created by humans, with no divine intervention. There isn't even any reason to believe that there is an anthropomorphic God that set the mechanisms of our universe in motion and then left it to run on its own thereafter. At best, all that can be said is that the creative force of our universe is something we can't yet explain.    Too often, it seems to me, this distinction is muddied. That is, pointing out potential flaws in arguments for atheism is not even close to the same thing as providing evidence for a traditional view of God.

This copy is perfect.  I was leery when I ran a search on this site.  I got a few hits, but nothing that really struck me as the \\"definite\\" copy I was looking for. <br /> <br />If you are looking for an heirloom quality copy, this might not be it......at least not for a couple more decades......as I believe this book will wear nicely and be a great piece once the pages start to yellow.

B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|When I heard that MCR were coming out with another CD I was very afraid of what I would hear.  After the success of songs like Im Not Okay, Helena, and Ghost of You I thought I was going to lose one of my favorite bands.  I heard Welcome to the Black Parade and wasn't really impressed.<br /><br />Then I picked up the CD.  I gave it a listen through and heard lots of things I liked.  Mostly with this CD you have to accept that MCR is trying something different and all the songs arent going to sound like Three Cheers.  Theres bits that feel like their debut, then Three Cheers, then Queen inspired riffing.  I would say best tracks are \\"Cancer\\", \\"Dead!\\", \\"Teenagers\\", \\"Disenchanted\\", and \\"House of Wolves\\".  With the songs they are all a good mix of slow and fast songs so it never becomes boring.<br /><br />I think this CD is a lot more creative and a lot more inspired.  It also shows that Gerard doesn't let fame go to his head.  He has always said that he wouldn't let the posers and fly by night fans dictate what music he creates.  Although I know a lot of people will throw the \\"sellout\\" flag too soon I would suggest taking another listen and get the lyrics.  It's really a well made CD.
B000E1NWGY|4.0|This is one of my first Heifetz cds and one of the favorties in my collection. The orchestra plays exceptionally well and gives the Bruch VC a driven pace that compliments Heifetz's style. Like a well made movie thriller Heifetz builds suspense and tension in all the right places. <br /> The Scottish Fantasy is a real gem. Played with feeling and flare and perfect tone. It is no wonder why Heifetz is considered one of the best that ever held a bow. <br /> The recording is also fantastic for it's time. I did not listen to the SACD tracks but the redbook material is of good quality.

B000G2YD3C|3.0|Pure Reason Revolution sound somewhat similar to RPWL or Porcupine Tree's lighter material, and anyone interested in those bands may like this quite a bit. Most tunes on \\"The Dark Third\\" begin with a mellow rhythm at a moderate tempo, other instruments are added, and the music slowly builds to a peak. There are heavier moments scattered about, but the majority of the disc is a laid-back affair featuring clean guitars, spacey synth work, and plenty of multi-layered vocal harmonies. Five of the six band members (one female) contribute to the vocal duties. They all sing good enough but no one really shines and there is no lead vocalist.      The biggest issue I have with this disc is the last song that clocks in at 13:13. Problem is, the song is really only five minutes long, then there is five minutes of silence before an unlisted track begins. After talking with Sony quality control they said this is not a manufacturing defect, but this is how the producer mastered it! I guess this is for artistic reasons? I've noticed this on quite a few discs recently and it's irritating! These hidden tracks are not worth waiting for.

0307341542|5.0|I started and finished this book in one day.  It is bit dark, but a very good novel. I just could not put it down.
1400079276|2.0|Though it wasn't clear to me what was going on, I loved this book for Nakata's charming conversations with cats up until the chapter with the graphically described cat murders.  Harrowing though it was for me to read that, I continued reading the book because it is a readable story and I wanted to finish what I'd started.  Having finished it, I find it ironic that Murakami refers more than once to Chekhov's assertion that if a writer puts a gun into a story, it has to be fired, when Murakami drops all kinds of guns into his story that he never does fire.  Why do we have this chapter with the cat murders?  What does Johnnie Walker mean when he says he's taking their souls to make a flute?  Why is he called Johnnie Walker, anyway, and why is another character called Colonel Sanders?  Why did Kafka's mother leave, why did he have a lousy relationship with his father, why did his father prophecy that Kafka would repeat Oedipus's acts, and why does Kafka embrace that prophecy, though at times he professes to be trying to escape it?  What's the evil thing that Hoshino kills at the end, and why does he have to do it so that Nakata will rest in peace?  I certainly don't know, because Murakami never does tell us why he puts any of this stuff in his book, nor have I found any other reviewer who's figured out the answers to any of those questions.  Throwing gratuitous violence and other unexplained eccentricities together for the sake of throwing them together hardly makes for great writing.  I might pick up a different Murakami novel to see whether he does any better elsewhere, but the only reason I give this book as many as 2 stars is because the narrative is, at least, competently written.
0375759174|5.0|The satire isn't as harsh, and the humor isn't as brilliant as you will find in Austen's major works, but don't let that stop you from enjoying this little book. <br /> <br />It's a charming and funny short novel that spoofs gothic fiction and romantic sentiment in a way that is surprisingly modern. Although the novel is full of subtle references to Jane Austen's favorite (and least favorite) books, you don't need to know anything about them to enjoy the story. Think of it as a teen comedy with moments of slapstick, lots of offbeat humor, and social embarassment galore, and you will be right in the spirit of Northanger Abbey.  Some of the customs and vocabulary in the book are out of date, of course. But most of it will be easy to understand even without footnotes, (although it's nice to have them handy if you need them). Austen's wonderful talent for dialogue still makes this little novel a treat to read. I have re-read Northanger Abbey every year since I was a teenager myself, and I still smile all the way through it! <br /> <br />
0142000663|5.0|I can not praise this book enough. It is excellent through and through. I know this is a book that is commonly read in high school. Since I did not read when I was young I deprived my self of some great reading. The begining I thought was slow, until the story hits the road, then I start to really feel their plight. My father had worked in real life in a apple cannery in California for a short time, he always said the \\"Okies\\" were some of the nicest most generous people you would ever want to meet. It is certainly ironic to read a book about oppression and discrimination by white people and to see that it is the same race of people who treat them as animals. That tells me that racism is much deeper than the color of your skin. If everybody read this, perhaps people would be more tolerent and compasionate, I know this is how the book made me feel. The end is tragic but so were the lives of many of these real Americans who were displaced by the Dustbowl.

0684800713|2.0|My apologies to all the Hemingway fans, but I didn't really care for this book. I had a hard time understand what was going on throughout the book. One bright spot was when they were in the mountains fishing and it is always nice to read of another country that is not yours. The characters did not appeal to me, I wouldn't want to party with any of them. They seemed lost and spoiled. Grabbing a quick peek at the Cliff Notes in a book store for this book; I found some of my conclusions were valid. But unfortunately it just wasn't for me. If you try this book I wish you luck.
0743289412|4.0|It's safe to say that Stephen King has grown as a writer.  For every novel that's an all out gorefest (such as Cell earlier this year) there's always a novel you can find by the author that goes a bit deeper and below the surface of modern day horror.  Lisey's Story is such a book.  In one eye, it is a horror story full of grisly suspense and supernatural wonders.  In the other eye, it's a love story full of emotional heartstrings.  Mix them together and you actually get what is quite an absorbing tale full of not only suspense and supernatural, but humanity and insight.<br /><br />Scott Landon is a bestselling novelist, and Lisey supports him.  At a speech, Scott is nearly gunned down by a madman.  Lisey manages to save her husband by hitting him over the head with a shovel, but ten years later he dies of natural causes.  Two years after Scott's death, Lisey goes searching through his files and realizes she's been in the background of Scott's fame all these years.  In many interviews with the bestselling author she is hardly even mentioned, and when she is it's usually not by name.<br /><br />Scott has his own little history, however.  Genetic insanity runs rampant in his family, and it was thanks to Lisey that Scott didn't suffer from any such insanity.  However, Lisey soon begins to understand what it was that Scott was facing and ultimately will have to face those same demons.  Her story will eventually lead her to a place called Boo'ya Moon, where she will unravel the mystery of the demons that tormented Scott.  Boo'ya Moon, where Scott often got the ideas for his stories.<br /><br />The book tends to jump around from past and present quite a bit.  Every now and then you'll find yourself reading a flashback.  Some of them are full of tender moments, but most of them are so that we too can get to know Scott.  And we do.  To the point where we ultimately feel sorry for his demise.  It recounts their courtship, and how deeply in love they truly were in love with each other.  What's so fantastic about these flashbacks is how they really help flesh out and develop the characters.  You'll grow fond of Lisey and Scott as she recounts the good times. You'll also grow to appreciate Scott as we dwell through some of his more bleaker moments in life, mainly his childhood with his father.<br /><br />Then there's the present.  Where we see Lisey dealing with the evils of Boo'ya Moon as well as how she interacts with her sisters.  Some of these moments are not nearly as interesting as the backstory itself, but it works to shape Lisey into the stronger person she ultimately becomes by the books end.<br /><br />Lisey's Story suffers from the usual King foley.  The fact that the novel is pretty big, and most of it is spent getting too deep into descriptions.  The book moves at a steady pace, but it is in many areas slow because King tends to get a little a little too far into his own head to describe everything that is happening to these characters, and the setting.  Some descriptions drone on and on for long stretches at a time.  Also, the made up language can actually get extremely repetitive.<br /><br />In the end, Lisey's Story is fantastic.  It's heartfelt, powerful, and most of all, terrorfying in a way you probably wouldn't imagine.  The books characters really come to life, even if they are drowned out in some of the description.  Lisey's Story should please any King fan.fantastic about these flashbacks is how they really help flesh out and develop the characters.

0312335164|3.0|If you like Dan Browns other books you will like this. I was attracted to this book because it had something to do with computers and encryption. There is very little reality from the computer world. After all if he used reality it wouldn't be very exciting. I would of liked it better had he done a little more research in the computer world to create a more realistic picture of computers and technology. It seemed to me he did more character development in this book than any other. This was kind of a nice change.
B000GCFO0I|4.0|Silent Hill, what can I say. I was waiting for this movie to come out and blow my mind just like the games did, but instead, I stumbled upon that euphoria in another movie entitled \\"Containment.\\" That's a different story, however. I was under the impression that Silent Hill was going to be a classic, but once I saw it, I see where it falls short. Yet, it strives to make up for what it lacks with a crisp world and a true-to-game representation of this abandoned little town with a ghastly secret.  <br /> <br />The game left a lot of the plot up to the imagination, but being a game, each player has his/her own player story anyhow. The movie tried to do the same, but failed in this area, because in a movie you follow the character, in a game, you are the character. We need sustenance! The movie would've been much more enticing had it teased my brain, and then tricked it, but gave me something solid to hold onto after it's over. That's what will make it memorable. Twist the ending, but explain it at some point during the film. Otherwise you'll leave the audience to wonder what happened, rather then revel in what could've been.  <br /> <br />But, overall, it wasn't a bad movie. There were lots of cinematic elements at work that covered up any misshapen plot holes and poor dialogue. In my opinion it's still worthy of a classic title, just not in the way I had originally imagined. So what all worked to the films benefit, and what brought it down? <br /> <br />Atmosphere and camera work- Obviously as you've well heard by now, the visual representation of Silent Hill is ecstatic. It is probably the most accurate and most thrilling game to film atmosphere to date. If you simply wanted to experience Silent Hill in all of its creepy visual glory, then this film would be a must see. The visuals alone and the excellent camera work almost make this film a classic as is, and certainly make it one of the most intensely artistic horror films of all time. I do wish more producers woulddevote this kind of time and funding to their atmospheres.   <br /> <br />Blood and violence- I think that Silent Hill did extremely well with this aspect of the film. Although the game listed some severe horror-scapes that didn't seem to be present in the film, I was generally satisfied with the proper amount of blood and gore. I will admit that I missed the scenes from the game, dripping with mutilated dead bodies strung up between wire mesh and other metal objects. The film included a few of these scenes, but probably chose to remove much of it for rating purposes.  <br /> <br />Plot- Now I know the game surfaced on a simple plot where you wreck your car and loose your daughter in this strange town, only to find out that it's overrun by a strange cult, which has the town under a grotesque plague...But the film barely managed to expand on this. Simple plots are great for games, but not movies. In-fact, you know it was either too complex, or too simple when you run through a door and enter into a bright light only to be greeted by the voice of a child, who blatantly explains the entire surface plot, and that was about all the further it went. The main character didn't even really discover anything. It was really a 2D plot, with no deep grounds for something 3 dimensional, something that allowed the audience to dig deeper into the film for meaning beyond the basic plot. You could try to dig in deeper, but at the same time, you wouldn't get much further than the surface, even with that mysterious ending.  <br /> <br />The characters- The game had characters of complex and different archetypes, which helped lead the main character through this strange little town. The movie had a slew of insignificant supporting roles compiled to simply set up the film and further the plot in any stage of events. The characters, excluding the mother and daughter, never seem to grow and change within the film. None of them, except Cybil and the mother even seems to complete a full character arch. This in turn makes them seem a little less human, more like zombies. However, they managed to include most of the key characters in the game, and at least provide them with some placement and importance with regard to the plotline. And in relation to the creatures.....(expletive deleted) I wanted more! They should've run to the police station, loaded up on mythical weapons, and rode the \\"action genre\\" wave for at least a mile. The game was all about killing those awesome creatures; the film was all about the atmosphere. I think we can all agree that it would've been much more exhilarating with the static from the cell phone resonating around every corner with enough creatures to build a small third-world country, and enough fire-power to take it down. <br /> <br />Acting and dialog- Of course in a film with this type of budget, and a well-established director attached to it, we know the acting is going to be superb. I think it flew in a lot of ways, but there were a few instances where the characters crashed and burned. I'm not sure if it was just scripted poorly, or the actors were at fault, but the roles were tough-enough as-is. However, it should be mentioned again, although every review had the same note; the dialog is lacking. There are some attempts to make it philosophical and other-worldly, but in the end, it's basic. It doesn't bring you into the same type of deep thought and conversation that the Matrix slapped you with and made you question your own existence. Maybe it just wasn't supposed to be that kind of film, but again, we go back to the surface plot, and the dialog never strays from the basics of human interaction.  <br /> <br />In the end, I feel that Silent Hill was a good movie. It was definitely worth seeing in the theatre if you got the chance, and I am sure going to buy the DVD at some point. Being a fan of the game (I own the entire series), it definitely excels in some areas and falls short in others. With the addition of a fewchanges, it would've been an instant classic, but I feel it might just fall short. In any case, it's worth seeing, and you won't be disappointed by the set-work.
1416524800|3.0|If you liked Dan Browns other books you will probably like this. Its plots are exciting but not very probable in real life. So shed yourself of reality and enjoy the story. I did enjoy how science oriented the plot was. Fortunately I don't know enough science to really see how improbable it was. Conspiracy theorists should love it though. It reads like a mystery-suspense made for television mini-series.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Easily a 5-star album, one of the best to come out of the 90's.  I just need to point out something that's been bothering me and why it's been knocked out of my personal all-time favorite album position.  Many have said SP is one of the most original bands out there.  But this album ('93)is so derivative of My Bloody Valentine's \\"Loveless\\" ('91) that it's almost depressing.  Don't get me wrong, it's brilliant and has moments of great originality musically, but the production and guitar tones sound like Kevin Sheilds, and Billy sounds unmistakably like Belinda Butcher, which he didn't on Gish.  That said, this is still one of the best albums ever made.

0743289412|5.0|This is part of a longer review I did for Compulsive Reader. I loved the book so well, I wanted to share some of that with you here. The pictures of the cover of the book don't do it justice. You should pick up one for yourself and see what they've done. <br /> <br />Lisey (pronounced Lee-See) and Scott are a young couple in love and become a couple married for a good number of years. Scott is an author who comes from a violent childhood. To me, this story is just about as much his as it is Lisey's. We travel back and forth in time, where King explains to us what's happened in the past that makes the present make sense. <br /> <br />Scott has met with an unfortunate death and leaves behind a few things for Lisey to find. These things will help her more than you think. Once Scott has left this life, Lisey is contacted by people who want to go over Scott's unpublished work. One of these people, a man by the name of Jimmy Dooley (and several other names), contacts Lisey and threatens her. His threats are not just so much hot air, as Lisey finds out, and finds out the hard way. He's a violent man, one who will kill her if he can, who will use any excuse to do it. Or perhaps he doesn't need an excuse. He wants to torture her first, though. Let me tell you, this is one bad man to run into! <br /> <br />Lisey's sister, Amanda, has had a troubled life herself and is known to cut herself. Lisey and her other sisters aren't sure what to do for her, other than commit her. Amanda has her part to play in the events unfolding, though. If she's locked up, she will have a difficult time helping Lisey, though. So what is Lisey to do? <br /> <br />For those of you who have read any of King's work, you'll understand when I say he has a way with a turn of phrase that sings. For instance: \\"She opened her arms to Jim Dooley and caught him like a fever.\\" So many have gone on about how he writes as if he's sitting right there with you. I'm not so sure it's that, but rather he has the vocabulary that reaches inside of us and makes us remember we're alive. His work stands up to rereading wonderfully as many can tell you, and each plot is memorable. If you say Dreamcatcher, I can tell you what happened. If you say Insomnia or It or Gunslinger, I can do the same. Some prolific authors lose that distinction in their quantity. Not King. <br /> <br />I also want to thank Scribner for making advance copies available. It used to be that there was no hope of getting ahold of one in order to write an early review. This time they've distributed more of them for a King book than they ever have, and it's with joy that I can tell you that I'll be right in line buying the hardcover for this title along with the rest of you. I collect all of King's work in hardcover, because it holds up to time. I know I'll be reading it again. And again.  <br /> <br />LISEY'S STORY sneaks up behind you on quiet little feet, then walks beside you as you become aware of the journey you're taking. Then....wow! Suddenly you're looking at a roller coaster ride of emotions and actions and glad for the thrill of it. The evil are truly evil. Scott and Lisey, they teach us many things about love and survival. Especially love. Especially survival. You won't forget their story soon. <br />
B000GCFO0I|2.0|Phrases like \\"complex storyline\\" and \\"dripping with atmosphere\\" are creative ways of saying \\"large plot holes\\" and \\"fairly well done effects\\".  Yes, it captured some of the atmosphere of the games, but all in all it wasn't scary.   <br /> <br />When I played the first Silent Hill game I was enthralled with the atmosphere.  The creepy sounds, the eerie - ethereal scenery.  This movie had little of that.  Yes, the ash strewn streets and the dark pale of the air were nice, but it wasn't even close to the experience of the game.   <br /> <br />The acting wasn't bad, but the storyline seemed to suffer from not clearly knowing how it was supposed to progress.  It had a definitive beginning and, a somewhat clear cut end (at least the \\"final conflict that is), but the rest seemed muddled and uncertain.  The final scenes seemed to only exist as a way to play set-up for a sequel. <br /> <br />Was it a horrible video game movie?  No, I won't say that.  Not with the vomit masses that Uwe Boll keeps purging for the world to see out there for comparison.  On the other hand it isn't the best either. <br /> <br />For those of you expecting to see the video game on the big screen you are expecting too much.  For those of you who feel that production value can make up for a weak plot and a meandering story progression then this may be the movie for you.
B000GH3CVQ|5.0|If you're fortunate enough to have found the Frames music and fell in love, then you will also find The Swell Season a worthy companion. Like any Frames song, these will also go deep to your core. They are simply beautiful. Marketa and Glen's voices are incredible, whether alone, together or with violin and cello. I'm listening to this recording daily since buying it and have only enjoyed it more each time. <br />Worth every penny. <br />
0553565915|4.0|While this book contains a couple of aspects I don't believe in, such as Satan and Hell, overall it is well-written, easily understood, thought provoking and believable.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and hardly put it down for two days while I was reading it.  Great work.
B000GG4XJM|3.0|5 stars for the music + 1 star for the pointless, full price reissue of this album=3 stars average.    I love the music on this album. The five new songs are worthy to stand alongside the tracks on the original version of the album, and I'd argue that \\"How Can A Poor Man\\" is one of the best songs that he's recorded in years.  So as I said in my review for the original album, don't let the idea that this is \\"another folk album\\" from Bruce Springsteen deter you from buying it.  Bruce may not have written the majority of these songs, and they may not be performed by the E Street Band, but it's as powerful and fun as anything I've heard from him in a long, long time.    However, I'm extremely disappointed that Bruce seems to have ended the US leg of the Seeger Sessions Tour, because I was really hoping to experience these songs live.  As it stands, many major cities, including my own, that have long been traditional stops on a Springsteen tour will not have a concert for the first time in thirty years.  That's a shame, because I do believe that there is a market for this music.  And while a poorly executed tour may have little to do with my enjoyment of CD itself, I would argue that Bruce's recent commercial moves are the main culprit for poor attendance at his recent US concerts and the modest sales of CDs like this.  While this music is great, I don't think that there's a market for hearing it performed live at prices near $100 a ticket, or for full-priced reissues of an album that is barely six months old and that contains only 5 new songs (the DVD content is pretty negligible).  I think that many people find Bruce's blatantly commercial ploys to be incongruous with the social message that he obviously hopes to convey by performing songs like this.  I mean, who is prepared to pay $100 per ticket to hear protest music in an oversized stadium or amphitheater?  And who wants to pay $14+ for a CD that contains only 5 new songs?  That doesn't mean that he isn't entitled to make money off of them, but I do believe that there's a balance between making a profit and making your music accessible to a wide audience.  Cheaper ticket prices would have drawn in more fans, and releasing these 5 new songs (2 of which were actually included as bonus content on the original CD) as a cheaper EP would likely have made this CD sell more copies.  Remember \\"Chimes of Freedom\\", Bruce?      Yes, the songs are available to be downloaded, but I'm not convinced that the sound quality of itunes is up to par with that of a CD, or that downloading music is the preferred choice for most people in Bruce's audience.  The same guy that won't remaster his shoddy-sounding CD back catalog or release many live recordings doesn't hesitate to put out this strange release?  I just don't get it.  The music is great, but save moves like this for pop acts that won't have near the longevity of Bruce Springsteen.
B000GY729M|2.0|I really liked Hot Fuss.  I have no idea what happened to the Killers from the time they released Hot Fuss until now but they need to fire who ever is advising them on their career.  There are at most two stand out songs on this album and the rest are very disappointing (even the \\"standouts\\" are disappointing).  I do hear the Bruce Springsteen and U2 influences.  But the Killers will never EVER make an album as good as U2's best (arguably Achtung Baby).  And I agree with one of the other posters when he/she said they didn't even make the best album released on the same day . . . that was The Information by Beck (if you haven't already gotten it, put down this horrendous album and go get it now).
B00005K3O4|4.0|My sister and I caught this on TV once and had to watch the whole thing.  If you like \\"campy\\" movies especially cheesy horror flicks this is the one for you!  I especially like the cotton candy coocoons and the attack-popcorn that the Klowns have at their arsenal.  Good for Halloween or anytime you want a laugh!
0440238609|4.0|Full disclosure:  I am adult reader who is a fan of \\"pre-teen\\" literature.  While the Potter series satisfies with plot, action and descriptive prose, this one satisfies at a deeper level.  It has a philosophical/theological angle that is thought provoking, and while some might say anti-church I would say more like anti-authority. There are still plenty of spiritual ideas to ponder.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|What a great voice she has! It is chocolatey and deep.  I really like the music that they are putting out.  Really rich.  She sounds like she looks if that makes any sense.
0803730470|5.0|My 3 year old son borrowed this book from his kindergarden and loves it so much I needed to buy him his own copy. Highly recommended book for this age!
0143034901|5.0|I don't know how much more I can say than all of the other reviews, but this is one of the best books I've read in quite a while.  In part this is due to the fantastic story telling of Ruiz Zafon, but also of the excellent job of translating by Lucia Graves.  Had this book not taken place in Barcelona and made several references about Spanish culture, I would have thought the original language had been English.<br /><br />As for the story I was completely engrossed by both the story, the characters, and their history.  I will admit that the length of the story could have been cut back a little bit, but at no point was I flipping ahead pages, either.  Ruiz Zafon tends to be very descriptive, but what I appreciated was that when he went into describing a character or an event in detail, it was interesting and had relevence to the plot.
B000002IZ4|5.0|I loved core when it came out. When they released purple i was excited and could not wait. I did not expect it to be better then core but was I wrong. This in my oppinion is still there best album. It has rockers like meatplow and vasolin it has slower songs like interstate love song and pretty penny. I know they were part of the grunge sceen in the 90's but they were much more than that. Here in 2006 this album is still an outstanding listen.

0060935464|5.0|This book was simply wonderful and a must read.   <br /> <br />I was amazed at the presentation of the story and the way Harper Lee draws you in.  The narrator is an 8 year old girl named Scout who is both innocent about the world and its social norms; while at the same time curious enough to be engaged and question \\"why does it have to be this way?\\"   It is from Scout's perspective that you are able to see the silliness and real injustice that we (adults) create by continually abiding by these destructive social norms that we consider \\"the way it has to be\\".   <br /> <br />On the surface, many readers will read this book and say that it is about \\"race relations\\".  But upon taking a deeper examination into the book, you will find that \\"race\\" is just the example used in order to convey an even bigger message on the importance of being both open minded and aware of oneself and the world around you.  Harper Lee, through the innocent eyes of Scout, challenges us to think outside the box, to accept people for who they are, to be open-minded, to challenge social norms and to start thinking for oneself.   <br /> <br />I have rarely identified with or have been more inspired by a fictional character as I have with Atticus.  He embodies every characteristic I wish to have from having compassion and love for everyone (even when it is undeserved), to his ability to critically think through issues, to his capacity of fairness, open-mindedness, and knack for remaining calm and peaceful in times of hostility and high stress.  What an amazing character. <br /> <br />To Kill a Mockingbird is not just revolutionary in its day for implying that blacks should be equal to whites; but is revolutionary even now because the underlying themes and messages it states still need heard and practiced today.  This book will impact you and challenge you, and should make you a better person.   <br />
0195145925|4.0|Barbour's thesis is that time is an illusion, and doesn't really exist.  According to Barbour, the universe is a timeless thing existing in configuration space; it doesn't \\"move through time,\\" but rather exists as an infinitely dimensioned manifold (my word, not his, and I may not have accurately captured his meaning) in configuration space, where each point on the manifold represents the universe in a unique configuration.   <br /> <br />Many of the key concepts in this timeless universe were developed by earlier scientists, particularly Mach.  Indeed, one of the benefits of reading this book is the many historical highlights and anecdotes provided by the author.  Even if you don't subscribe to his timeless universe hypothesis, the books background material in Newtonian dynamics, special and general relativity, and quantum mechanics makes it worth reading. <br /> <br />The first part of the book lays out general concepts, including the notion of configuration space.  I particularly liked Barbour's method of using three points (a \\"universe\\" with just three points) as a metaphor for the timeless universe he imagines.  In this simplified three-point universe one can define a history as just a path through configuration space - thus eliminating the need for a time variable (at least as far as describing a history is concerned, anyway). <br /> <br />One of the traps in both reading and writing this book is that the concept of time is so permanently ingrained into our minds that it seems impossible to discuss the issue without recourse to phraseology pregnant with the very thing (time) that Barbour says doesn't exist.  His wording is literally dripping with time-impregnated words as he describes a timeless world.  He understands, even apologizes for the problem - but it persists and was a source of distraction and confusion for me throughout the book. <br /> <br />I think the author does a better job of showing how to eliminate time (or at least think in terms of a timeless universe) within the context of Newtonian dynamics, than in a relativistic and quantum universe.  The explanations from an Newtonian point of view are pretty straight forward, but as he progresses through special and general relativity, and on to quantum dynamics, the picture - and figures - become more sparse and (it seems) more dependent on speculation. <br /> <br />At an intuitive and philosophical level I find myself largely in agreement with Barbour.  There's something weird about time.  It doesn't quite fit.  I've often caught myself toying with the notion that it's an illusion.  On the other hand, we can measure it, and all our measurements seem to be consistent.  It's hard to see how we can measure a second so precisely if it's just an illusion.  <br /> <br />On another level I'm almost inclined to think the whole thing is based on semantics.  After all, if someone told me that pain is an illusion - that it's really just electrical impulses transmitted to my brain - I'd reply that that's an explanation of what pain is, not an argument that it doesn't exist.  Similarly, the universe may exist in timeless configuration space, but my consciousness certainly doesn't.  Maybe what we mistook for the universe (and us) moving through time is really just us - our consciousness - moving through configuration space.  We mistake our travel through configuration space as movement through time the same way someone floating down a river might mistakenly think the trees are moving past them, and they are just standing still.  In fact, I wonder if that might be a characteristic of consciousness - something that moves through configuration space - and perhaps the \\"laws\\" of the universe look the way they do because our consciousness is constrained, by virtue of its existence, to travel through configuration space along histories (paths in configuration space) that have certain characteristics (increasing entropy, for example). <br /> <br />That's just speculation, of course, but that's what a lot of Barbour's book is, too; a lot of speculation.  Not that that's particularly bad, it's just that, in the end, there's nothing really testable here to evaluate.   <br />
0525457585|3.0|I've never seen the famed movie version of this book. In fact, I didn't know anything about it except there was a dragon like being who was white and had a lion face. So when I needed something simple to read, I picked this up, hoping for something close to \\"The Princess Bride\\" or maybe \\"The Last Unicorn.\\"    I was wrong.    \\"The Neverending Story\\" is about a boy who literally gets pulled into a good book, but really it is a philosophical novel about stories, whishes, reality and fantasy. All good stuff, but not what I was looking for. Reading this book is a little like being in my philosophy class. I don't really understand why I thought this was a children's book before-I don't know anyone under the age of 12, at the youngest, who would have really understood the deeper parts of it.     That said, I still liked the book. But I probably won't ever read it again, so three stars from me. Perhaps I'm not the kind of person who can appreciate a book like this one.
B000025OG6|2.0|If you are in the group of fans who thought that Toto IV through The Seventh One produced some of the most airtight performances on the planet (and I'll throw out \\"Waiting For Your Love\\" and \\"You Got Me\\" as examples), then I strongly advise you sample whatever sounds you can from \\"Kingdom of Desire\\" before purchasing.  When I first put it on I thought I was listening to any one of a dozen early 80's rock bands.  I warmed up to it a little at around the 8th track - there is some nice work from this point on, and there is plenty of good material for David Paich fans on this cd. <br />In my humble opinion, Toto are one of the most talented groups ever assembled (in any of their incarnations) but I wasn't thrilled with the Rock direction they took on this album.  It seems almost like a step backwards for them.
B00004XPPK|4.0|That toss of the hair & the \\"strip\\". Rita Hayworth had them first. Actually,  \\"the strip\\" consisted of taking one glove off. It just was so sexy it seemed like more. An in your face performance by an absolutely gorgeous Rita Hayworth. She took my breath away for a moment when she first appeared.  No doubt in my mind this is her best performance. She is so hot in her scenes with Johnny played by Glenn Ford. He is at his best also. The plot is convoluted & a bit improbable. She marries Johnny's boss but it obvious they had a thing before & still have it.   She is wild & slutty but it is just to get Johnny jealous. The opposite of hate is not love but indifference. The emotions of love & hate are razor thin close. Johnny & Gilda hate each oher so much it hurts. But they love each other so much they can't survive without the other. This is referred to by some as noir but I didn't see that. It is a fine, almost great, top shelf star power movie.
B00005JPAD|5.0|Frank Costello (Nicholson) rules the streets of the Irish American community in Boston.  Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Damon) both start out on those streets, but their paths diverge.  Both enroll in the police academy, but while Costigan wants to be a state trooper, Sullivan is Costello's right-hand man, and just wants to be help out the man who helped him while growing up.  Costigan's plans are changed when Captain Queenan (Sheen) and Sgt. Dignam (Wahlberg) hand pick him for a job getting into Costello's gang.  He succeeds, and soon is passing information to the police, but Sullivan knows that there is a leak, and soon both sides are looking for the rat.<br /><br />\\"The Departed\\" is a great movie, and will definitely be in the running for best picture come Oscar time.  The cast is great all around, with everyone bringing their best performances to the table.  DiCaprio and Damon are the core of the movie, and they prove up to the challenge.  Nicholson is excellent as always, especially when he is allowed to just be Jack.  The story is great, and is an example of how a remake does not need to be bad.  Scorsese makes is all flow smoothly, and the movie does not feel as long as it is.  This is easily one of the best movies of the year, I highly recommend seeing it.
B000001E8P|5.0|Released 11 years ago, this was a hit in the UK. I didn't know that until last year. <br /> <br />I was looking for some music from the britpop era, (being a huge fan of Oasis, Blur, Coldplay, The Verve, etc) and a stumbled upon their greatest hits CD. I must say that the only track I really got into was \\"Disco 2000\\", the rest were OK, not great. Then, after a couple of spins of that CD (and listening to the lyrics) I started lo like them. <br /> <br />I got His N' Hers (I played it to death) and then this one... wow... I played three times in a row, it was an amazing experience. Jarvis Cocker knows how to create an atmosphere with each song. <br /> <br />Every song could have been a single, amazing lyrics (to me, this guy is one of the best lyricists in britain nowadays). The stories of typical day-life on working-class people from the UK is something that the casual listener can relate to.  <br /> <br />I recommend this CD to everybody. It came out during the so-called britpop era (I love that genre, even though most of the bands are now defunct). I won't mention any particular track. <br /> <br />Get it right now, it's a piece of Britain's music history.
B00006JU7T|5.0|'Serpico' is a definitive Pacino classic, with all the right stuff to keep you riveted!  The acting is killer, and dialogue top notch.  Albeit now a bit dated as far as the film's scenery and dress goes, it still timelessly captures the essence of the NYPD back in the 60's and early 70's.  Anybody intelligent knows that corruption still goes on in many departments (and many other industries too), but back then it was epidemic, and needed grand jury investigation.  That said, most police officers are commendable, honest, caring people that perform their duties very well, and proudly so.  But for those that flouted the law, and accepted graft, this film is an indictment to say the least.  This is, in my opinion, one of Al Pacino's finest moments and the direction by Sidney Lumet was brilliant!  One of the best films of the 70's, and a 'must see'.
B000E33VWW|5.0|I can't say anything about this movie that probably hasn't already been said in the other reviews.  This true crime story has haunted me ever since I read George Plimpton's book on Truman Capote which is the foundation for the new Capote movie being released this year.  If you are a fan of Capote's \\"In Cold Blood,\\"  you will not be disappointed in this behind-the-scenes type movie of how he came to write the book.<br /><br />Hoffman definitely deserved the Oscar for his adaption of Capote which was brilliant.  I only wish this movie would have explored a bit more of his feelings that the real Capote had for Smith, one of the convicted.  Imagine standing there having to watch someone you so deeply cared about being put to death.  Chilling!  This movie does a great job of capturing that feeling in the end, but could have used a bit more of it when Capote first met the killers.<br /><br />Otherwise, this movie is enduring magnificence to the saga that is Capote!
6305622914|5.0|As I originally come from the same part of England this movie was filmed in, I found this doubly enjoyable, although my buddies in Alabama might need a version with subtitles... <br /> <br />This is one of those rare movies that is as good as you have heard, and it is one of the best human interest stories I have seen in a long time. A real film about real characters, who many people will be able to identify with, or recognize in their friends, family and neighbors. <br /> <br />While the laughs are there in bucketfulls, the movie also sensitively deals with issues such as divorce, co-parenting, unemployment and psychological impotence, in additon to the obvious theme of male bonding in the face of social and financial stresses. <br /> <br />One of the few flaws in the plot is the way Dave's wife seemed to be the only woman in the whole city who hadn't heard about the boys practising for the strip show. <br /> <br />Good, solid entertainment.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Not so much the life-story of \\"The Man in Black\\", \\"Walk the Line\\" tells of how J.R. Cash became the iconic half of Johnny Cash and June Cater Cash.  It's a story with the ups and downs we've all come to expect from a celebrity bio - the talented artist finds himself trying to deal with family trauma and dysfunction, has bad brushes with substance abuse and is ultimately redeemed by love to become the icon that he's remembered for.  Johnny's start was a precarious one - he sounded horrible until he could learn to channel his past into his music.  The story informs Cash's rise during run-ins with Elvis & Jerry Lee Lewis.  He courts the lovely June Carter.  The Carters are already celebrities in Country music before Cash enters the scene, yet they're down-to-earth, and probably more sympathetic to Cash than June is.  (They get one of the funniest scenes in the movie when, while still June still remains unmarried to Johnny, they giveCash's drug supplier the double-barrel brush off.)  Joaquin Phoenix doesn't quite look like Cash, but he goes the distance when it comes to capturing Cash's talent for injecting gobs of angry and funny energy into his bottomless baritone.  This is best displayed when Phoenix kicks off his show at Fulsom Pen - creating the now historic concert album - with \\"Cocaine Blues\\"; Phoenix plays Cash like a demon, a performance alone that should have netted him an Oscar (he lost to Hoffman for \\"Capote\\").  Robert Patrick is a surprise with the unenviable job of Cash's father - a stiff and unartistic soul who nevertheless managed to escape alcoholism, yet seems unwilling to help his son out of his own substance abuse problem. <br /> <br />In short, it's funny and sad - something that most celeb bios shoot for, but few achieve.  Even if the script seems to lag, Phoenix and Witherspoon save the day.  If anything, you can watch this disc, just to hear them play.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|Dialogue. Dialogue. Dialogue. It's all about the dialogue.<br /><br />Nick Naylor has the gift of gab, and he uses it to defend Big Tobacco. And Thank You For Smoking really doesn't take sides if that's what you're thinking. This is not a documentary or a \\"Super Size Me\\" reality trip. It's entertainment in the purest form of the art.<br /><br />Whether you hate smoking or smoke like a chimney, Thank You For Smoking will make you laugh. It'll dazzle you with quick-witted rhetoric. It indeed will provide food for thought about how this country is not lead by leaders, but by those that can spin a tale in their favor with the cleverest amount of craft.<br /><br />And most importantly, Thank You For Smoking epitomizes the notion that you don't necessarily have to win an argument to walk away with all of the chips; all you have to do is make the pubic believe that your opponent is wrong.<br /><br />Thank You for Smoking is intelligent, thought provoking and thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. Not a single boring moment.<br /><br />SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING:  Aaron Eckhart's (Nick Naylor) performance is killer.  Katie Holmes' precarious positions could cause blindness. William H. Macy's perfect reflection of the people that run our country could drive you to drink. Seeing J.K. Simmons portray a brash pompous jerk again could cause deja vu. The lovable Robert Duval telling you to smoke could cause you to smoke. And Sam Elliott looks so much like the Marlboro Man you could get whiplash from a double-take.
0440180295|4.0|Slaughterhouse five is by far a great pies of work by Kurt Vonnegut. The story's plot focuses on the life of the protagonist named Billy. The story can be a little complicated being that it is a story in a story of the author's who is a character in the book. <br />The book more or less has no structure in it. The plot structure cannot be described as linear, but rather it is more spatial in its organization. the style of the story to me was almost bleak and depressing, with a subtle mention of science-fiction in it.
B000I2J5UG|5.0|I'll be the first to admit it: I was not a fan of My Chemical Romance. This was exactly the type of band I had taken to ignoring; it sounded like pop-punk, so it had to be worthless in my eyes. My Chemical Romance was nothing more than a derivative band with no identity, a group who were more interesting in vampires and selling T-Shirts than in crafting essential music. My disinterest was such that when told by a friend that the new single (the epic \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\") was actually good, I distractedly listened to the first three minutes and said I liked them. After all, I couldn't be missing much, could I?  <br /> <br />It turns out that I was missing a lot, and in writing this, I'm going to eat my words. It was easy to dismiss My Chemical Romance before, but now it will be impossible. With The Black Parade, an urgent, passionate, insane, awesome piece of music, this band has become essential to the musical landscape. This is an album for the ages. <br /> <br />The Black Parade is a concept album, and tells the story of a man known only as The Patient, a victim of cancer. The album starts with the Patient's death, spends its midsection ruminating on the life he left behind, and ends with his good-byes. It's a hugely ambitious work, and it would have been so easy for it to implode into a sloppy, incoherent mish-mash of \\"sensitive\\", junior high level poetry and forgettable power chords.  <br /> <br />That's the kind of thing the old MCR would do. It's what characterized their first two albums, their Goth-oriented fashion sense, everything about them. But that's the thing about this album: more than anything, it's a coming out for the new My Chemical Romance--a glorious, unapologetically theatrical behemoth. The Black Parade of the title is as much a celebration of this new sound as it is a rite of passage for the deceased protagonist. <br /> <br />Here we see MCR dipping their toe into all sorts of musical styles. \\"Mama\\" starts out as a baroque number reminiscent of The Decemberists, before evolving into an exuberantly nasty cabaret number (complete with a cameo by Liza Minelli). \\"Teenagers\\" is a throwback to some of the best punk rock of the 70's. The lyrics may not exactly be poetry, but they don't have to be. The juxtaposition between the bombastic grandiosity of the musical arrangements themselves and the direct, bruising quality of the lyrics (Cancer's icky \\"I'm soggy from the chemo\\" sticks in the mind) make for a sort of abrasive splendor; this is possibly the most triumphant album about death and dying that has ever been recorded.  <br /> <br />None of this would matter of course, if the music itself wasn't up to snuff. Here, frontman Gerard Way reveals a previously untapped musicianship, an ability to make the hugeness of The Black Parade's sound remain fresh through the use of diverse instrumentation and irresistible hooks (something The Killers failed to do in their similarly anthemic but overcooked sophomore album). It isn't every band that manages not only to stick a tra-la-la sing-along at the end of a song song, but dare you not to sing along with it.  <br /> <br />And now, as the Patient joins his Black Parade, as the hype dies down, as the implications of this astounding achievement make themselves known, questions arise: was it a fluke? Did My Chemical Romance always have this untapped potential? And, perhaps most importantly: what's next? All I have to say is this: Gerard, the ball is in your court.  <br /> <br />10/10
