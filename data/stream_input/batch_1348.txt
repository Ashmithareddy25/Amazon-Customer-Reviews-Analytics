B0071QIN00|2.0|I thought this looked good for my Kindle Fire, and I was right. The gameplay was fun. The graphics looked decent. I am just tired of every racing game having to have a scantily clad female in it. I was hoping it would be something my young boys could play, but I will not start teaching them such objectification of women. Thus I have deleted this app from my device.
B005XY67WI|5.0|We have a couple other Shakira's videos, one  of them is the Oral Fixation Tour Bluray. Just like the other bluray, this En Vivo Desde Paris presents a superb recording both video and audio, played very well in our Sharp 1080p 52 inch, as well as on our  Martin Logan Vantage (driven by Bryston amplifiers). I admire the director of photography or whatever the role is to present such good photography from all possile artistics and dynamic angles! The video captures the nuanse of the entire performance very well, the dynamic of the audience (huge stadium!) and definitely the dynamic of Shakira!  I and my wife are fans of Shakra ever since, love her songs and performances. We sit enjoying during this entire performance of some 90 minutes or more. With black pants, possiibly spandex, and golden top, Shakira looks still young, vigorous, slim and sexy.  Gypsy presents interesting dance drama presented by Shakira before the song was being sung, very intricate and passionate  dance. The dance gave a narrative to the song and made the song became more meaningful (at least to me). There was also a dancer before Nothing Else Matter was sung, very great performance. Nothing Else Matter is an unexpected interpretation by Shakira with the acoustics guitar team, a rock song by Metallica that I love  was sang so beautifully, very enjoyful along with Sahita passionate dance. La Tortura was sung without Alejandro, she seemed dancing similarly with the one in the other bluray. But I prefer the session in the other  bluray, in which she sang with Alejandro Sanz, with more complicated dances. They carefully selected the ending songs which are Hips don't lie and then waka waka. Waka waka was delivered with a very powerful message, effort for delivering Africa to a better future, I love the songs, full of high spirit and melodious. I also saw Waka Waka performance in the video of World Cup in South Africa. Confetti was speread at the end of the performance, a very artful  photography as the video ending.  The Extra part, just like other Shakra's videos give many glimpse of Shakira's live and performance behind the stage, nothing unusual, but still very good to see how Shakira looks in 2010 and 2011... btw the Paris show was in June 2011.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I own over 800 movies and have seen thousands in my lifetime. This is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Any one who rates this movie low did not really sit and watch the movie.  If ever a movie deserved an academy award, it is this one.  When you watch this movie, do not apply it to anyone but yourself.  Do not apply it to your husband, or your wife, or your grown children who are raising your grand kids.  Apply it only to yourself the first time you watch it.  This movie is geared towards fathers and rightly so, but every parent in the world needs to see this movie, even if you are not a Christian.  This movie applies to all parents.  If you have children, who are raising kids, or just got married,  buy the movie yourself and give it to them. I don't give a two hoots about the Madalyn Murray O'Hair's out there, this movie should be required watching for every single high school student in this world as a minimum prerequisite for graduation.  This movie does not beat around the bush, it come right out and tells you what is wrong with with the youth in our country and many other countries today.  This movie will grab you by the shoulders, and shake you, till you wake up. This is not a movie that should be watched for it's artistic value or how well it was done in the Hollywood style. You watch this movie for it's content and message. Again, anyone who gave this movie low ratings did not watch the movie, they only watched at it.
B0071QIN00|5.0|Excellent graphics &amp; tracks.  Another great free app from Amazon for my Fire, but this one is worth the purchase as well.  ...you gotta love playing it with the tilt controls!
B004FOA84A|4.0|It was entertaining for about an hour, and then it was over. Far too short, even for 99&cent;. I'd love to try more from this dev, but not if they are all this short.
B0071QIN00|4.0|This is pretty fun. On the kindle fire it works well, I like it. This was confusing at first but now I really like it. Worth trying!!!!
B00021R7CG|5.0|An early HBO film that gave us a hint of the great films and series to come. Yes, good script, fine acting, tense drama. More importantly, unlike so many others of the genre, it faces and asks the final, the toughest, question, \\"Is there anything on this planet worth destroying it for?\\"
0670022950|5.0|This book is long, almost 700 dense pages. To quickly apprise potential readers of what they're getting into here's a nice summary of the book found in its closing chapter:<br /><br />\\"The decline of violence may be the most significant and least appreciated development in the history of our species. Its implications touch the core of our beliefs and values - for what could be more fundamental than an understanding of whether the human condition, over the course of history, has gotten steadily better, steadily worse, or has not changed? Hanging in the balance are conceptions of a fall from innocence, of the moral authority of religious scripture and hierarchy, of the innate wickedness or benevolence of human nature, of the forces that drive history, and of the moral valuation of nature, community, tradition, emotion, reason, and science.\\"<br /><br />I went ahead and just quoted Pinker directly because it is futile for me to try to improve upon the superlative quality of his writing. The clarity and logic of this book are also of the highest standard. Even with such a long text, digressions are not pointless and the book has an organization that is always strongly making the main point (that violence is declining). The researched material seemed so thorough to me that the only reason I started to forget the point of the book was because by around the half way mark, I was already taking it for granted as if it were an obvious point of fact.<br /><br />I felt that Pinker was fair to different perspectives and thoughtful in his analysis yet I'm sure he'll have many critics for the opprobrium with which he treats religion and other magical modes of thinking. I know religious people really believe that religion has been a civilizing force in human history, but Pinker shows that it has simply not been the case. Pinker is not stridently against religion per se, but I think it's clear that like all non-psychopaths, he is appalled by violence and his evidence- and there is a lot- shows that religion is one of the most pernicious factors for exacerbating it. (If you strongly don't agree, buy the book, read it, and write your own analysis; I'm just reporting what Pinker reported to me.)<br /><br />While this book necessarily drags one through the worst horrors of human history, it is, if you can stand that sort of thing, delivering a terrifically positive message. It turns out that if you block out the sensational aberrations and really take a clear look at the big picture, things are getting better, many, many important things! While there may be some room for slight opinion differences on some of the causes and best practices to strive for, over all, the main point of this book seems irrefutable. Humans are getting better at treating each other better. Or as one of my favorite musicians, DubFX says, \\"Peace on earth is evolution for mankind.\\"e of the most pernicious factors for exacerbating it.

B0061S073A|5.0|This is the app I have been looking for as my son accidently ordered an app a few days ago.  It's also a good app sharing your Kindle Fire with others so that your personal stuffs stay personal.
B0050SYS5A|2.0|We got this after realizing that our weird shaped living room forced us to play Kinect games with our legs pressed against the couch.  The pros:    -The Zoom does allow you to stand and be recognized closer to the TV, though not the 40% that they advertise. At best, it'll give you maybe a foot and a half.    -It looks pretty cool. Like night vision goggles for your Kinect.  The cons:    -It performs its task with a fish-eye type lens that distorts the edges of the playing area. In some games, the effect is not so bad, but for anything that requires the least bit of precision, it becomes a nightmare. Even trying to place your left hand in the position to bring up the Kinect menu is nearly impossible.    -It scratches the face of the Kinect. It doesn't effect the performance, but it looks bad. It comes with a sticker to protect the Kinect, but as you will have to be removing and replacing the Zoom depending on how each game reacts to it, it will come off. (Ours came off the first time I tried to remove and replace the Zoom.)    -It will cause some games (Fruit Ninja is a prime example) to constantly stop and recalibrate. Due to the above mentioned fish-eye effect, it has a difficult time seeing the ground properly so some games have difficulty placing you in the right spot.    -The overall quality of the motion capture is much worse. When tuning, you can see how the lens makes the image grainy and makes parts of your body invisible, causing the constant recalibration mentioned. Our legs were almost never picked up by the Kinect through the Zoom.    -Microsoft does not endorse the product and actually recommends against using it. It turns out that you can't just slap some lenses on a high precision instrument and expect it to work properly.  In the end, we rearranged our living room and will be returning the Zoom. If you absolutely can't make 8 feet of space, then it may be worth trying the Zoom, but, honestly, there just aren't enough games to justify the aggravation.The only reason that it doesn't get 1 star is that it does technically do what it claims.  On a side note, I bought this at Gamestop for $30. If you are going to spend money on this contraption, at least buy it on Amazon for much less.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|A little laggy, but great app. Very convenient for access to files and programs when I'm not home, love using Army Builder from my android.
0307888908|4.0|This book surprised me with how applicable it is to job hunters.<br /><br />It seems to focus on \\"creating your personal brand\\" and its value to changing or finding a career.  Basically, by treating your job-hunt as a \\"start up\\", you increase your chances of landing the career you love.<br /><br />I would have liked a more in depth coverage of the subject, hence why only 4 stars.<br /><br />Great book!
B0071QIN00|4.0|as long as ur not one of those no life's who spends all there time and effort rating apps its pretty cool
B0064NTZQ2|3.0|I really don't know what to make of this movie. It reminded me a lot of David Lynch's Lost Highway (except not as good). The parallels between Ryan Gosling's character and Balthazar Getty's character are identical. They both work in a garage, they both fall for a blond, they both get involved with gangsters, they both kill people for the benefit of their lady friend. Hell, they each have their own garage sidekick. Ryan had the limping old man. Balthazar had an aging Richard Pryor. I guess overall I think Drive is decent. What is up with all of the staring in the movie as others have suggested? Weird. I did actually enjoy the 80's discotheque sound to the film along with the score provided by the great Cliff Martinez.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I'm tired of the lip synching pathetic \\"artists\\" that pass for music these days. This CD rocks! The record companies went down the tubes for a reason. Because the \\"product\\" they were selling was sub-par. Buy this and show everyone who's number one!
B0050VI5SI|5.0|I first heard \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" on Letterman and instantly loved the song. My husband got me the album as a gift and I was hesitant. But withing a listen or two, I love the whole album. Brings me back to my early teens when I was introduced to Alternative music by my older cousin, who I thought was the cat's meow.<br /><br />Been searching for another band that strikes me like this album does. They seem to be far and few between. I pretty much guarantee that if you like one song, you will like them all.<br /><br />When's the next one come out?!?!
B002VRZEYM|2.0|Around 3/5ths through this hole filled documentary, a presumably Hispanic (likely Mexican) family expresses their role in this thing.  I find their particular lot in this largely their own fault.  Racial connotations aside, your time, and theirs, are one's own responsibility.  No one but one's self dictates how one's time is spent.  If one chooses convenience, over some degree of responsibility, he or she no longer truly has the right to \\"bitch\\" about it.  \\"No time to cook\\" implies a degree of neglect of one's children.  If this occurs regularly, then that person officially is trash.  Over $200 in medication, counterbalanced by an informed diet really only implies a large degree of responsibility lacking.    We know the governments the world over have failed in the stewardship of their people. Well, cry about it, or take action?  A legitimate question, considering the loudest protestors rarely are accountable for the plight they decry (thus their noise serves only to agitate the cattle, instead of spending money on feeding the masses what they feel is proper).  It's a simple thing, complaining, and lamenting.  But at the end of the day, it's all our fault.  All legislature allows room for interpretation. And all therefor are allowed by us, the majority.  Big money means nothing if a retail vendor chooses not to accept some currency or another.    You are to blame for the acts shown in this film.  You are to blame for your poor health, and all political failings. You are the devil you denounce.  You are the evil politician.  Because you would rather discuss it, or complain, instead of banding together with like-minded folk, and acting.  One such crowd though, will act so foolishly, and lack so much wisdom, they are little better than the poor treated so-and-so that they would support- while sitting in front of a T.V., and buying ANYTHING advertised. You are more suitable for food than the cows.  Which sadly (for all of us) seem somehow more possessed with logic thanman.  I hope your cancer is as brutal as the complaints you lodge on others.  You all are hippocracy. Ignorance.  And there is no finger on your hand worthy of doing any pointing.  I hope you enjoy the hell you expressly worked so hard to create.  Inaction, and tolerance does only one thing:  nothing.
0955153077|5.0|This Book is Beautiful!!  I am very new to digital arts, but 3d total has been one of those communities I have kept in my pocket the whole time I have been learning.  I just received this book and I have got to say, its the best publication I have seen from 3d total yet.  This book is very well constructed and comes beautifully packaged with a hard cover for storage. The organization and flow of the text is wonderful, and the tips and learning is great information and feels quite fresh (not just a recycling of articles).  The tips section is wonderful and details specifics on creating specific subjects and effects. I am very pleased with the book, and I think it is pretty much a must have for any digital artist interested in 2d painting art (even if its to frame 3d art).  Add it to your bookshelf, you won't regret it.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I am very happy with my kindle fire cover, it us sleek and looks very neat as it fits well. I would recommend this item to my friends.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|This bluray has it all, the music selection is great, all of the songs are good to watch and hear, plus you get Katharine Mcphee performing The Prayer in duet with Andrea Bocelli, what else could you ask? The other artists do a great job here, you won't be dissapointed.
B003L8GPTI|5.0|Great quality pressing. Nice mastering. Punchy lows. Clear, open and expansive sounding. This record lives up to how I remember this album sounding on vinyl back in the '70s, but in a brand new pressing on a nice, heavy chunk of vinyl. Worth having.
B004I744AS|5.0|This app makes learning new words delightful and fun! There are so many different and interesting aspects to this app such as the daily words, articles, horoscopes, matching games, hangman, spelling bees, and there are pronounces in American and UK English accents, as well as how to pronounce translated vocabulary. The definitions provided are lengthy and insightful. This app is very user friendly, I would highly recommend it!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this is a great mix of strategy and leisure in a game. its great to play on kindle fire. big screen and its zoomable for the ability to play at different comfort levels. as addictiong as ever. everyones played this game.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I would give this app 5 Stars if it could recognize Kindle owners and those that had Prime Memberships so that the purchaser of those products could enjoy them on all their equipment running Kindle products!!!
B005K17RU0|1.0|sorry guys. my favorite weather app until it started force closing everytime I open it. please fix so I can change my review.
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|This is one of the best movies of all time. I don't want to tell you any more just see it for yourself.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the game where you have to move the face in the fish bowl is difficult on kindle fire. good games for kids though.
B0071QIN00|5.0|Great control without any force-close or problem when played in my G2X. Best free Amz app so far imo !!!
B0000TB050|4.0|I slammed the U2's 360 Rose Bowl blu-ray for many different reasons, but I can't slam this dvd at all. Perhaps the word passion can best explain what makes this dvd a better show. Bono oozes passion for his home-country crowd. I like the set list better too, Pride(In The Name Of Love) just about brought tears to my eyes(me! crusty old me!) The only flaw would be the video quality in some of the scenes(blu-ray has spoiled me I guess)Despite the below average quality of many scenes I will probably grab this dvd before the 360 blu-ray when I need a U2 fix.
1849163847|5.0|Repressed knowledge is the heart of this book. Most of the \\"detection\\" that takes place in what is in principle a detective novel is really a process of personal revelation for the main character. The detective is less uncovering the truth than having it revealed to him. that's probably as much as can be said without spoiling it for other readers. I found the way the process is handled to be convincing, which is a big achievement. Many detective novels at some point require you to suspend belief. That isn't the case here although it is an extraordinary story. The physical and psychological landscape of Lewis is well-described and captures the sense of being on the outer edge of the world in a very unforgiving environment where people divide themselves into those who can escape and those who cannot, but, like the Hotel California, its not quite certain that anyone can really leave.I am very surprised this has received so few reviews because it is one of the most enjoyable books I've read in a long time
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote on a daily basis. I easily keep track of anything and everything. The best part is is that I can access my notes from anywhere with an Internet connection. So many options, that I only use about a third of them all.
B005D0RDKW|5.0|I am a HUGE Rush fan and I loved this Blu-Ray. Some made issues with Geds voice;I do agree a bit. Presto sounds weirdly sang;though great they did it. Overall he holds his own. The music is what shines show is pretty much flawless;they never dissapoint..  Cant wait for next tour and album!! 8D
B003YWUTJI|4.0|This 18-track collection of Norah Jones' guest appearances on various albums (plus one duet with Dolly Parton, \\"Creepin' In,\\" from Norah's second album, [[ASIN:B0002VYQ2U Feels Like Home (CD+DVD)]]), showcases Norah's ability to adapt to various musical styles.  I did not care for the hip-hop tracks, although Norah's voice makes them tolerable, but enjoyed all of the others.  Her cover of Elvis' \\"Love Me\\" (with The Little Willies) is especially good.  If you are a Norah Jones fan and don't want to buy a lot of different artists' CDs to get one or two tracks featuring Norah, this collection is for you.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I have been using this case for a few months now and I am mostly happy with it. I like that it protects my phone without adding a lot of bulk. Would it survive a 4 foot drop to the pavement? Probably not, so be careful. This is not a case to cushion falls, it's more for protection against everyday wear-and-tear like scratches, bumps and maybe a few short drops (if you're lucky).<br /><br />Just be aware that this clear material will pick up color over time. I have to wear dress pants to work and always keep my phone in my front pocket. Over time, the case has taken on a brownish color from the fabric. The case almost has a rose-like tint to it now. Cool? Well, you be the judge. It doesn't bother me all that much but it could some people. If it concerns you I would recommend getting the \\"smoke\\"-colored amazonbasics case instead, or a different model. It's hard to top the value of this inexpensive, simple case though.
B006PKQQJS|5.0|you should play this game because its so fun.also because when I first played this came I didn't like it thin I played it and loved it. you should really play this game its my faverite game now.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game makes you think at multiple levels. I would even call it a brain-training game because I feel that my brain got a good workout every time I play.  Nicely written, good graphics, clean.  Highly recommended.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The lightweight yet, quality leather material has held up extremely well over several months.  I bought this back in November when the Kindle Fire was first introduced. Since then, this cover has been exposed to coffee, soda, milk, snow, rain, mud & even a dog's mouth! Other than a few light scratches that I was able to successfully buff them out with a leather cleaning solution & microfiber cloth.<br /> My Fire has been dropped, kicked, tossed. & stepped on numerous times without ever a negative result! This cover has been strong enough to withstand it all!<br />I honestly cannot see how anyone could complain about this product except for maybe the price. Personally,  I feel it is worth every dime I paid and I'd paid $39.99 at that time.<br />I highly recommend this product!
B00127RAJY|3.0|Good way to sweat. Only 20 mintues, but if you're looking for a quick fix to lose a bit of weight real quick this isn't going to do that. I watched my diet, and did this every day, for a few weeks-i've only had it that long- but didn't lose weight (but i didn't gain either). Since i'm a stay at home mother i don't leave much, so if you're not very active this won't cut it. BUT it is a great exercise and it's not too hard. I'd rather just run a mile or something, i feel that i get more accomplished doing that.
B0071QIN00|3.0|U can get in glitches that annoy me alot.Please patch these glitches.This game isn't that great for people that say its so beast
B0071QIN00|4.0|Limited only by your own coordination, or lack thereof. The movement seemed very realistic. The UI worked just fine. I'd give it five stars if I could play it better. While I tried this as as a FAOTD, it is definitely worth well more than a $1.99  BTW ***AMAZON*** WHY do you indulge superman75's misguided attempts to entertain? More importantly, he distorts the ratings by awarding one star in EVERY review.  Clearly, he cannot offer a fair review; his comments DO NOT ADD TO THE DISCUSSION. (I apologize to the readers for even acknowledging this...this person's existence).
B006Y5BWQG|4.0|Katherine McPhee and Megan Hilty compete for the part of Marilyn Monroe in a musical about the screen idol.  Ironically, both have to have much better singer voices than Marilyn ever had.  Although this part is interesting, I personally found some of the other characters even more interesting.  Angelica Huston plays the producer and we get to sit in on her divorce conference with her soon to be ex husband.  I really enjoyed that. Then the songwriting duo has problems with the potential director.  He is a brilliant director but a miserable human being (so my guess is that he is in as our director). Plus the female songwriter, played by Deborah Messing, is trying to convince her husband that the Marilyn show won't throw a wrench into their plan to adopt a baby.<br /><br />So far the musical numbers only occur in the course of rehearsals or try outs and do not erupt at any point in the show, like they do in GLEE.  So it really cannot be compared to GLEE.<br /><br />I intend to watch more episodes to see if how the show develops.  I think it is promising.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B0071QIN00|5.0|wow awesome game. Great graphics and fun controlls plays perfect on th kindle fire. There needs to be more games like this...awesome.
B0036SSZIC|5.0|I think everything that is said in this film is factually correct. Much of what conservatives say about American freedom is nothing more than falsehoods coated in a layer of propaganda that hides much of the truth behind free markets. It makes me angry to see how gullible and apathetic the public has become over basic human rights and the extent that we are controlled and dictated to by the rich and powerful.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I AM SO EXCITED TO RECEIVE MY MOVIE, I LOVE THE TWILIGHT SERIES, BUT I LOVE THIS ONE THE MOST. I AM SICK OF PEOPLE ON HERE WRITING NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABOUT THE MOVIE IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT THEN DONN'T BUY IT OR WATCH IT PLAIN AND SIMPLE. BUT FOR THOSE THAT DO LIKE IT ISN'T IT EXCITING TO FINALLY OWN THE DVD.
1594132054|4.0|Why does the Kindle edition cost as much as hard cover and almost double the price of a paperback?  What am I missing?  I read the first chapter and it does look like an amazing book, but at that price I will go with a hard copy - if I'm spending the money, I might as well get something tangible for it.
B0071QIN00|4.0|This is one of the better \\"daily freebie\\" games I've seen so far.  This game is well done.  The graphics and sound are good.  The levels are really good.  On the down side, the physics are pretty unrealistic, but that's OK.  Heaven help me if I could lean forward a little on my own bike and do a front wheelie like that.<br /><br />This is definitely one of my favorite Kindle Fire games so far.  It was a free download today, but I would recommend it even if you had to pay a few bucks.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Courageous is a wonderful movie and a MUST SEE for all men, whether they're fathers or not. Teenage boys also need to see this movie to help them realize that there's more to being a father than just having relations with a woman. It's a powerful movie with a great message - one minute you're laughing your head off and the next minute the tears are flowing. Definitely Sherwood Baptist's best movie so far! Which, if you haven't seen their other 3, then I highly recommend them! Flywheel, Facing the Giants and Fireproof are all excellent movies with great messages.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  the puzzles got progressively more difficult.  however, I never felt like I hit a road block on one of them and was unable to continue.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think 100-in-1 games are very fun and you will love this game as much as i did!I LOVED it!!!!

B005XQLBU4|5.0|The subject says it all.  Great update for a classic game.  I highly reccomend it to anyone who loved the original.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Excellent quality, great seller and fast delivery. I enjoyed this series and can't wait for season seven. I also purschased season one, two, three, four and five and loved all of them! Great to add to your video library  .
B002MQYOFW|3.0|THIS SERIES STARTED STRONG WITH THE HUNGER GAMES AND GOT A LITTLE BETTER WITH CATCHING FIRE THEN IT GOT AWFUL AT MOCKINGJAY SHE JUST KILLS OFF EVERY ONE SHE CAN THINK OF BUT I BELIVE OVER ALL THE HUNGER GAMES WAS A EPIC TALE BUT NOT BOOK FOR CHILDREN UNDER 13!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Excellent game, I find it very relaxing and a challenge trying to beat my own high score. Highly recommend this for all age groups.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|I love the watch. It is really light, it looks good and professional, and the clasp is secure so the watch bracelet does not open by mistake. I have had other Skagen watches before and completely love the watch that I can wear even when I have carpal tunnel. This is probably the only watch I can wear without pain. Sharp looking watch and classy.
0736092269|4.0|This is a great book if you're looking to brush up on your anatomy and learn what exercises work which muscle groups.  The book features an image of the body for each exercise showing which muscle groups are worked.  The descriptions are fairly short yet effective, there are images showing the movement, and comments on how different grips affect how the muscles are worked.  There are also sections on stretching, injury prevention, and how a person's morphology affects how they lift weights.  Overall the information is very good.<br /><br />There are a couple areas where the book falls a little short, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  First, there are several exercises in the book which are very similar that work the same muscle groups that don't explain any difference between the exercise.  It's good to know what muscle groups the exercises work but it would be better to know why I would choose one exercise over the other.  The second thing was that the book seemed to try to appeal to too large of an audience (on one page mentioning something relating to osteoporosis, on the next something that only a serious bodybuilder would care about) and perhaps falling a little short in addressing each audience fully.  Lastly, the abdominal section is filled with variations of crunches and leg raises, and while these do work the abdominal muscles they seem like an under-representation of the many varieties of exercises which can be done to work the abdominals.<br /><br />The book is a worthwhile purchase and other than the flaws mentioned above is a very solid book which provides a great amount of information about anatomy as it applies to strength training.
B0059XTUMC|5.0|It's Hollywood in 1927. Silent movie star George Valentin wonders if the arrival of talking pictures will damage his career. All that is jarred by Peppy Miller, a beautiful young dancer waiting for the big break. Peppy is part of the new wave of talking pictures. George clings to the fading silents. George gets caught up in this new world of noise; he becomes the butt of some nameless joke in front of a gaggle of chorus girls. But someone is trying to save George. Someone really cares. In a black-and-white dream world, everything is very sad, very real. Very touching. A veiled biography of, perhaps, John Gilbert, \\"The Artist\\" is casually classic, and avoids sugary sentiment. And it's silent. An original homage to pantomime, the double-take, and dog tricks, \\"The Artist\\" is,finally, a tribute to Charley Chaplin. The cast includes Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo(very good), John Goodman,James Cromwell, and Malcolm McDowell as the butler. Filming was done at RED Studios Hollywood, which was once Metro Pictures back lot no. 3, constructed in 1915. A scene late in the film is lifted from Douglas Fairbanks in \\"The Mask of Zorro(1920)\\". Accolades and awards aside, Michel Hazanavicius' \\"The Artist\\" seems simply  blessed by the gods. James Cromwell plays Clifton, the chauffeur. His father was John Cromwell, a director of silent movies.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|not great but entertaining. most games work well and it is fun trying to unlock new ones. it does stink that you have to play them repeatedly to get enough points to unlock new ones.
B006470HZ6|5.0|I honestly think that season 1 Was better. I hope that the series don't go towards the soap opera way. I still love it, but I hope this is as far as it goes with the drama. I don't mind a little bit of it, but it is supposed to be a survival show!. I just hope, the second part of season 2 picks up a bit, PLEASE, MORE SURVIVAL STUFF!!
B002BWP49M|1.0|witness such a tragedy!<br /><br />Saddens me to see such monstrosities released on DVD!<br /><br />Oh but it horrifies me to see it on Blu-ray!<br /><br />To see Bella's stone face in HD is like running into a tree!<br /><br />To see Edward's sparkling chest truly scrambles one's brain into a mess!<br /><br />Such overrated trash is not meant to be seen, but quality no longer needs to beam. How easily one can see the stitches on the seams. It seems that good movies in 2012 are naught but a dream!

B0055PMURG|4.0|Even though I never plan on surfing in my entire life (I have a fear of open water) I love watching surf movies. This one was a joy to watch. I also love the fact that the religious part of the movie was not over dramatized or propaganda-ish, I felt like I was watching real people, regardless of their religion. Yeah there were times where that Hollywood cheese makes its way in, but its never in an outlandish way. I like that they kept true to the fact that she placed 5th instead of rewriting so that she placed 1st. If they had done that, it would have ruined the message the film was trying to convey. There's another movie very much in the vein of this one because its based on a true events called Wild Hearts can't be Broken. Both girls must over come tragic events to do the thing they love most. Its not about her losing her arm, its about her never losing her love of surfing.<br /><br />If you love surfing movies, this one can find a nice home on your shelf.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Don't let the one star reviews deceive you. This is a good app. It isn't the most revolutionary thing you will ever play, but it's fun and a good way to waste time. my only complaint would be that some of the games aren't very responsive, but that's easily overlooked seeing as how you aren't REQUIRED to play every game. Overall it's worth the install. Especially since it's free.

B006W0QOF2|1.0|I wish I could give it no stars, but that wasn't an option. Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. The trailer has all the action and all the talking for the whole movie in it.  The actual movie is full of awkward silence and random over the top unneeded violence.

B0034G4OY0|5.0|Amazing movie although almost unheard of. Visual effects, unusual story line probing the psyche of the disbeliever, yet you are left to make your own decisions.  Although it is \\"fantasy,\\" it brings a sense of \\"this could really happen\\" to the screen.

B003P2WO5E|5.0|It's been a while since I read this book, but I figured it was just one of those books that I have to tell people about.  A lot of people think the beginning can be an investment because it essentially has 3 prologues.  After having read the book I can see how those prologues were vital in setting up the book correctly.  I personally enjoyed the first section even thought it's just setting you up for the story it's in and of itself action packed and fascinating.  I'd also like to add that Sanderson is the king of magic, I think he has the most inventive magic systems in all of the genere.  All in all this is probably my favorite book I have ever read and that's saying something since I'm typically quite the critic.  If you haven't read this book then you really really should.
B004I744AS|5.0|I love this. Especially the offline mode. It's much better than dictionary.com or the kindle dictionary. I reccomend this for the kindle or any device
B004M9ZI0M|4.0|As a Shakespeare fan, I was elated to read that Julie Taymor was planning a film version of THE TEMPEST. If she could turn a minor work like TITUS ANDRONICUS into a thrilling film, imagine what she could do with Shakespeare's last truly great play! The movie opened in December 2010 -- and then disappeared. No further distribution. Released on DVD late and without fanfare. Even an episode of \\"Law & Order: Criminal Intent\\" based on Taymor's troubles with the Spiderman musical, which referred to her last film as a flop. Not good signs . . .  While Taymor's version has its flaws, it is still worth watching. First and foremost, for the Prospera of Helen Mirren, who gives a performance of power, range and nuance. A close second is Ben Wishaw's creation of Ariel, enhanced by Taymor's creative use of special effects. The part of Miranda might have been written for newcomer Felicity Jones. And, in a brilliant touch, the play's epilogue is rendered hauntingly in song, played behind the end credits. Finally, as one has come to expect of Taymor's films, all of the visual elements -- costumes, settings, photography -- reflect a carefully integrated realization of the play's themes.  One of my tests of a filmed version of a play is: are there moments I passed over in reading that come alive in viewing? Two examples come to mind from this video: the old counselor Gonzalo (Tim Conti) is played for comedy -- a sententious windbag like Polonius; and the temptation scene between Antonio (Chris Cooper) and Sebastian (Alan Cumming,) which has a wonderfully sinister feel to it.  There are some mis-steps as well. Russell Brand is a marvelous performer; but he cannot, in even the remotest sense, be said to act. Miranda is a sparkling creature; but her Ferdinand (Reeve Carney) is bland both in presence and line delivery. The conclusion of the comic subplot belongs in a cartoon.  This version is, as a previous reviewer noted, better than previous attempts but ultimately unsatisfying -- I think due to problems with pacing and proportion. Propera's scenes seem rushed, while Miranda's are lingered over. Ariel and Caliban need to be seen as forces of equal strength, but the CGI emphasis on Ariel renders him a minor character.  For a fully realized production of THE TEMPEST, I recommend the CBC's DVD of the 2010 Stratford Shakespeare Festival production with Christopher Plummer. It is no slight to Ms. Mirren's considerable talents to say that this is a part Plummer was born to play.

B002BWP49M|5.0|The Blue-Ray release is very nice in detail on HD TV. You can see the dark scenes like the wolf / forest much better than in the movie house in my case. Its is a must have for the fan, may be the collector edition with a movie set flower petal from Target mail order. I am in the Twilight universe for a couple years and married for 30 years with my beautiful wife who I met in our high school auditorium with more love over the years; just like Bella and Edward.  This is the last book of the saga and finally see Edward and Bella married after all the angst of twist and turn since they met. The emotion toll are deep and moving. This movie are much closer to the book than the Eclipse movie, a lot more dialog straight from the book. The major different from the book is the wolves and the Cullens had never fought in the book but in the movie. The wedding was held in door vs outdoor. Bella character is all about love with Edward and missing feeling with Jacob. She is back to her original determine personality to love Edward forever than the more independent personality in the movie of Eclipse. I would guess the movie made more sense if you are heavily in the books. Otherwise, you would loose a lot of subtle acting that Kristen and Rob try to portray in the movie.  For those doesn't know. The dying Bella is a mechanic copy of Kristen to make her looks thin and frail. I think they did a good job on the birth segment and mostly accurate.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|...never having been a fan of horror fiction (real life can be horrific enough).  25 years ago I worked for a fellow who read everything King wrote and often would finish one book in a long weekend binge.  I am a fan of SciFi and time travel in particular should always be interesting. I was not quite prepared for the level of detail and character in his writing.  Most scifi is plot driven and moves so fast that the \\"worlds\\" created are mere pencil drawings.  King's book is like a large oil painting with a multitude of colors.  I cannot recall ever in my 50-years and thousands of books, having the tiniest of tears in the corner of my eyes as the story closed, and truly wishing it would continue.  I imagine a reread in a couple of years. A truly wonderful read.
B000002KBU|5.0|The songs on Joni MItchells, Blue, album are my ultimate favorites. I kept the album since my college days 40 yrs ago, even though I do not posess a turntable. One day, I craved to hear the songs and I was delighted to find, the CD offered on Amazon, for a VERY GOOD price! Even paying shipping, it was under 10 bucks. The quality is excellent. Now, after a busy day or when I just want to take a mini vacation in my head, I play Blue. Ah, sweet memories take me away.
1419387243|4.0|** spoiler alert ** Before starting to review this book, I read a lot of reviews on it to get a sense of what others were saying about it. This may be cheating, but in this case, I was having a lot of trouble coalescing a lot of impressions into any sort of articulate analysis, and reading other reviews has really helped me organize my thoughts.<br /><br />I had a lot of personal reactions to this book because of the fact that so many of the references were cultural staples during the time I was a high school student. Contrary to what some reviewers stated - that the cultural references were out of date and/or unrealistic, I think they were pretty much spot on. I was in college during 1991-92, but as a high schooler I remember the cult of Rocky Horror (though I was not a part of it), and I remember the whispering, bullying, shunning, etc. that those on the fringes received in high school. At that time, the fringes included homosexuals, artsy types, druggies (and those who dabbled), super smarties, and of course all the other standard groups. There is no question that taunting, bullying and the like happened to the fringes kids. There is no question in my mind that Charlie would have experienced that type of treatment. I don't know how high schools are now, but I expect things have not changed a whole lot with regard to kids who are weird, unfashionable, or different. It is certainly realistic to me that oddballs tend to draw to each other, especially if they have any kind of kindred feelings and kindness toward others like them as a result. Chbosky was hardly speaking of the mainstream high school kids here, so that the mismatched element to this group of friends seems right to me.<br /><br />With specific regard to Patrick & Brad, and how they navigated their relationship, I think to some extent you have to have lived through the 80s and early 90s to understand some of their behaviors. Attitudes were a lot different toward homosexuality...it wasn't as mainstream as it is today, especially in high school. There absolutely were known areas to go for the purpose of casual sex. It wasn't at all easy to \\"come out.\\" Additionally, this was before there was a widespread understand of sexually transmitted disease, and the risky behaviors (meeting in the park after dark to hook up with an unknown person) that made one a high risk candidate.<br /><br />I think Charlie's voice rang absolutely true in the book. He was smart, weird, emotional and broken. He felt completely responsible for the death of his Aunt Helen because she died on his birthday while out to buy him a present. What teenager wouldn't feel like that to some extent, especially a teen who had other emotional and psychological issues (as we learn at the end). I certainly did not expect that turn of events, but in the end, it explained a lot about Charlie and his fragility.<br /><br />I also think that, again contrary to what some reviews suggest, it was completely realistic for Charlie's parents to be somewhat naive to what was going on in his life. For a kid who had emotional & psychological problems - from which he appeared to have largely recovered - they were realistically and understandably glad that he had made some friends. He had a teacher at school who showed particular interest in him because he was so smart...as a parent, especially one who was unaware of the molestation, this would be a welcome experience. I remember going through high school and being pretty much autonomous when it came to my academic decisions...not surprising when you're a responsible student, and Charlie was definitely that. Now I do think that they were ridiculously out of touch when it came to his social schedule, but there are a lot of kids out there who, at 15 or 16, have an inordinate amount of freedom (and free time). It seems understandable to me that this inattention to his activities is part & parcel of their characters, and also of their happiness at seeing him make some new friends...especially after his best friend committed suicide.<br /><br />Finally, it is easy to see why this book created controversy. While I didn't see it as encouraging deviant behavior necessarily, I can see how the fact that it was accepted and there weren't really any negative consequences could make Charlie's 9th grade experience seem exotic and desirable. He was essentially a good kid who went through a lot of crap, so this whole situation is an anomaly. But then again, back in my high school days when we were reading Catcher in the Rye (to which Perks of Being a Wallflower has been compared), Holden Caulfield's experiences were an anomaly as well. I don't know that I'd be comfortable as a parent with it being on a required reading list, but I'm not a believer in censoring lit, nor in being an uninvolved parent. I believe it should be available, and parents should know what their kids are reading so they can, when necessary, talk about it.<br /><br />All in all, I loved this book. I loved the epistolary format. I loved that Charlie had an emotional outlet. I loved that his family pulled together when it counted. I loved that he had a teacher who was interested in him for his brains, and who was not a pervert. I loved that he had friends like Sam & Patrick...because there are kind kids out there, and there is always a net gain when people are kind to each other. And I loved most of all that he recovered. To me, that may be the most important part of this whole story...that you can recover, that suicide is not the answer, and that help is available when you need it.itted suicide.

B001AKTZPA|5.0|I guess the answer is obvious: I freakin' love this album! Green River is as enjoyable as Bayou Country. The songs are pure gold: CCR really knew how to create some perfect rock music in the past. The first track, also called \\"Green River,\\" is a fantastic opener, a lovely showcase of things to come. \\"Commotion\\" will make you want to tap your feet (or even better, stomp them hard on the ground!). \\"Tombstone Shadow\\" is typical CCR goodness. \\"Wrote a Song for Everyone\\" is perfect for a ride across the Heartland or, from near where I live, the Central Valley. \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" may sound horribly negative, but at least the music is good. \\"Lodi\\" and \\"Cross Tie Walker\\" are undeniably rich in lyrics and melodies (even if the latter sounds pretty much the same as \\"Bad Moon Rising\\"). \\"Sinister Purpose\\" is a sure crowd pleaser, while \\"The Night Time is the Right Time\\" is a TRUE love song that's timeless. And let's not forget the bonus tracks: the splendid instrumentals (\\"Broken Spoke Shuffle\\" and \\"Glory Be\\") and the live performances (\\"Bad Moon Rising,\\" \\"Green River,\\" and \\"Lodi\\") are really enticing to listen to.<br /><br />It looks like CCR has become one of my all-time favorite Southern Rock bands (even though they are NOT from the South). Now they've joined Lynyrd Skynyrd and Marshall Tucker on the top of my list. Kudos to Cook, Clifford, and the Fogerty's for some wonderful rock music. And kudos for creating Green River.<br /><br />Grade: 9.8 out of 10<br /><br />Also from CCR<br />Self-titled (9.1 out of 10) [[ASIN:B001AKTZP0 Creedence Clearwater Revival]]<br />Bayou Country (10 out of 10) [[ASIN:B001AKTZO6 Bayou Country]]

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I assiduously avoided this series when it first came out, as I am typically not a fan of science fiction, it is not my habit to read a lot of YA fiction, and the dystopian genre that has become so popular is not something that interests me in and of itself.<br /><br />However...<br /><br />These books have met with huge success and almost instantaneous popularity.  There again, a reason I tend to shy away until something proves not to be a flash in the pan.  But they continue to be bestsellers - all three in the trilogy - and with such rave reviews, I finally broke down and read The Hunger Games.  And I loved it.  Were it not so widely known to be YA fiction, I would not have immediately recognized it as such.  Certainly the two protagonists are teenagers (which is a huge giveaway), but the story itself is not necessarily YA subject matter.  Couple that with some tightly crafted writing, and it is easy to see why these books have been such hits.<br /><br />It is not as though post-apocalyptic settings are particularly new.  They're not.  Neither is it a particularly new twist on the socialist, totalitarian government construct.  What Collins does here is take old, time-tested themes and weave them into a beautifully constructed story of commitment and love in the face of almost certain death.  And it truly is a story of life or death, because the penalty for losing (or being outsmarted) is death...public, (hopefully) gruesome, and brutal.  This is not light subject matter for anyone, let alone young adults, and yet it is gripping, captivating, and utterly moving.  The more I read, the harder I rooted for Katniss.  Collins made me believe she was the angel among demons.  She was the bright spot in the dark.  She was the one to love...and the one to beat.<br /><br />This story reminded me so much of The Running Man by Stephen King.  A game, set up by a central government, where the penalty is death, and in order to win...to live...cunning and brutality are required.  The difference, of course, is that in The Running Man, the game is \\"voluntary.\\"  In The Hunger Games, it is a part of life, a payback required from the government as a reminder of who had power and who didn't.  I am always amazed, in the dystopian settings, how easily controlled the populations are, but then I am reminded of how most fiction contains elements of truth, and dystopian fiction is no different.  We have only to look back in history a few years to Hitler to see the parallels.<br /><br />All this to say that this is a book worth reading.  It is thought provoking, infuriating (in ways), mesmerizing, and in the end, rewarding.  I'm looking forward to the second  & third installments.e Running Man, the game is \\"voluntary.\\"  In The Hunger Games, it is a part of life, a payback required from the government as a reminder of who had power and who didn't.

B006O5YHUY|5.0|I've never cried so hard, for so long, watching a film in my life. In the end, our quest to take a stand somewhere where the lines are drawn simply - when the events and decisions that put us there are so gray, so complicated, so hard to come to terms with - brings us to a pure place where heart, courage and will can let us finally win. This film brings us to that place and carries us through a moment that so few of us ever get to have in our lives. I am so grateful to have seen this, to have been in that place, if only through the lens.
B0068RHGJM|5.0|...my faith in Nightwish is renewed.  How wonderful an album!  I would even say it's better than Dark Passion Play.  These guys are really showing they are masters of their craft.
B006UG90RM|5.0|No ballads! YES! David Lee Roth couldn't do a ballad if his life depended on it. As much as I enjoyed Hagar with VH, this is what it's supposed to sound like. Everybody has had much to say in these reviews but I will try to keep it simple.  If you're a life long VH fan and you bought this cd then you should have nothing to complain about. What did you expect? Dave to be singing about conflict in the Middle East? C'mon! The boys rock out exactly the way they did back in the day. Maybe half the songs are re-worked never released old demos. So what? Not a single song on this cd sounds like any song that they every released. This cd is not a masterpiece but then again is anything out there these days a masterpiece whether from new or older rock artists? Hardly! And the production is fine and dandy. I don't see any reason for complaint there. And are we missing MA's backing harmonies? Boo hoo! I love Michael Anthony but his talent is expendable here. As i implied before, if you're a life long VH fan then you should love this. Buy it! Love it! As Is!
B0071QIN00|5.0|I am having a blast with this game. It is like a 3D version of the original ExciteBike! The graphics look great on my tablet. You can either use tilt controls or on-screen buttons and both ways work great. There are 30 different levels included and trying to collect 3 stars on every level adds a lot of replay value to the game.<br /><br />Everything here is very well done and it is obvious that the developer put a lot of hard work into this game. This is a great free app of the day but worth every penny of the normal asking price.

B005GVA2L0|5.0|I can't even begin to tell you how many times I've listened to this album--and it never gets old.  And this is with so many great music releases of the past year of so, I'm so focused on a few, like this album.  There's the inevitable comparisons to Fallen and how it doesn't compare, but don't let the naysayers fool you!  This is not the Ben Moody band, and they made that perfectly clear with the opening track; make no mistake though, this is a solid album and it's great music.  Highly recommended for lovers of hard rock with female vocalists.
B0071QIN00|4.0|pretty awesome love the roads that are ummmmm like where the hell is that lol but all in all still cool worth at least a cuple of bills
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a very good movie which focuses on the roles men have in life. The main portion is regarding fatherhood and is geared to help men move the right direction in building healthy relationships with their children. This is very good!
B0071QIN00|4.0|this app is great and really fun to play glad its free but wouldn't give it a five star rating
B0058VA2U4|5.0|This album very quickly grabs me and doesn't let go until the last track ends.  There's not a weak spot in this.  Sounds best when cranked LOUD while driving!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|super fun game but kind of addictive and hard but it was a tu. was to stay busy its full of classics too so j enjoy doing this on plane rides .getter itt
B006OFN0SE|1.0|This movie might have been a compelling story, but I really couldn't tell you.  All I can tell you is that my suspension of disbelief was punctured, no, shredded, by this phenomenal underachievement by Leo.  The accent fluctuates.  His version of an old man reminds me of a cartoon, and, well, I just didn't buy it.  If you can forget the acting and just focus on the lines, this movie might be for you.
0956031609|5.0|i read the book after i watched the dvd, the book was only delivered after the dvd. couldn't wait to read the book first. the book portrayed more than what is shown in the dvd. a love that endured so much and took so long to come to fruition is worth waiting for. i read i cant think straight and watched the dvd as well by the same author.
B0034G4ORC|2.0|Hollywood actors, upset by alien bullies, dress up like soldiers, go where they shouldn't, give away their positions, waste thousands of rounds, have tantrums, and generally get into lots of trouble before eventually turning the tide by taking out the enemy's space-hog network server.  You sense that a fair amount of money went into this movie, but it's mainly stuff blowing up. The plot and interaction of the 'soldiers' is so unreal that the aliens are more interesting. The dialogue is so trite that my girlfriend got the giggles and annoyed some students sitting nearby in the theatre. The camera tremors are so bad that another good title would be \\"JIGGLE: Los Angeles.\\"  The explosions are convincing. If you like lots and lots of shooting and hollering and very large scale urban renewal, check it out.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome and you have to unlock other games but the games are really fun. you should really try it today!!!&iexcl;

B0000640VN|5.0|This is my favorite romantic movie of all times. Actually it is from this movie I found out who Hugh Jackman is. Never heard of him before. (I know, shame on me). I know it is a modern movie in a modern setting but there is something about it that makes me miss the olden times and the way how men used to be, so respectful, gentle and considerate. After watching this move, modern guys just don't appeal in the same way. Eeeh, I fell in love with Leopold. It's very light hearted movie that I can watch over and over and over.
B004GYY714|5.0|This app is great! After you enter all your locals (sadly,Clear Channel blocks access to MANY local stations in the U.S.) you can begin listening to and adding in national and international radio stations. So much listening fun! Love it!/
140053271X|5.0|I must admit I was a skeptic regarding ebooks. I thought nothing could beat a good ole paperback in my hand. after purchasing 2 of these for my wife and I on a whim I have to admit, I love it.  Allows me to read books more quickly,not sure why, faster page turning, easier to find where you left off, maybe easier to read for longer periods of time, easier to carry with you anywhere maybe?.  Adjustable font size so you don't have to squint at small print, display is just like a real page, and you can flip pages with a swipe, a touch, or using the buttons on either side. I can't compare it to a Kindle because I never owned one, but my understanding is that it allows more formats than the kindle does.  so simple to transfer books from my computer, or purchase books via WIFI at B&N or at home, or even borrow from my local library online!  can't say enough great things about it, my wife and I were thrilled with them, not really any cons, wifi is difficult to connect in some places, thats pretty much it
080726203X|4.0|The narrator's voice is very nice, and he reads at a good pace. My only negative comment is regarding the chapters starting in the middle of tracks, and sometimes even needing to change the cd in the middle of a chapter. If I was only listening to it for enjoyment, this would not be a concern, but I am using it for my class and it becomes a hassle when reading 1-2 chapters a day. Overall, it's a great audio!
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I just don't get it. Firefly was such a great show in every respect. The actors were superb and the storyline was awesome. You really liked the characters. They were all very distinct individuals but, like any family, if you mess with one you mess with all.  And it was Joss Whedon...need I say more?  Someone had their head up their b**t when they decided to cancel this show.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Not too bad, but can get bored easily. Not so much that you won't try it again &amp; again. Good way to spend a few minutes.  Teens would love it, have to think. before you move.
B004132HZS|5.0|I'm just adding my 'five stars,' for this well-reviewed and popular series.  Those who enjoy intelligent drama (with some humor!) and high production values will not be disappointed!
B0062NAX1U|2.0|My wife and I have been consumers of all the Sherwood Pictures productions. My wife seemed to enjoy this one and wept during parts of it, but my reaction was different - I found absurd certain aspects of the worldview expressed through this film. For instance, Robert Amaya plays Javier Martinez, an immigrant working man with sanitized \\"legal\\" working status (this is simplistic - in real life Christians, as well as non-Christians, more often find themselves grappling, in ethically tricky situations, with illegal immigrants). Now, desperate for work Javier is praying in an alleyway when Alex Kendrick (as Adam Mitchell) spots Javier in prayer (about what he knows not) and offers him work. Now yes, God does answer prayer, but not often on a time frame dictated by the constraints of film-making. Moreover, Javier gets work in a factory, and in a short time is promoted to manager owing to his integrity and work ethic. If the creators of this film understood what it is really like in a factory; who gets promoted in factories and why, they would not have insulted us with this simplistic depiction of the work-a-day world. The real world is much uglier, and how God works in the lives of his disciples in difficult circumstances is usually nuanced and complex. If in order to make films that audiences will pay money to watch, Sherwood Productions feels compelled to make simple the complex reality of life, and demystify the mysterious and often painful, protracted means by which Jesus brings his children victory over the world, than I doubt it's worth it. (In other words, if one can't portray in film the way God actually works in the live of people, than the Christian cause is not advanced by compromising the truth to satisfy the demands of film-making.)<br /><br />The producers of this film suffer from the uniquely black and white understanding of reality typical of conservative Baptists. At the same time, it is the simple faith of these Baptists that inspired them to begin film-making in the first instance; so, black and white simplistic thinking is a double edge sword.<br /><br />The redeeming virtue of this film is its central message, a message not entirely coherent until the end. That message is - that men in their role as fathers have a tremendous impact, for good or evil, on their children and yet men are largely unaware of their full impact, or potential for it. This central message is obscured by the unbridled preachy ambition of the Baptist filmmakers to squeeze in about a hundred other sub-messages that fill up and push this film way too long (over two-hours). For their next production Sherwood needs to simplify the plot, limit the number of truths they wish to teach, and exchange this film's complexity of incoherent noise for exploring the complexity of a victorious life through Christ.making in the first instance; so, black and white simplistic thinking is a double edge sword.<br /><br />The redeeming virtue of this film is its central message, a message not entirely coherent until the end.

1878424114|5.0|By learning and applying these principles, you will have the ability to put yourself in harmony with nature. And when you are in harmony with nature, you will have the power to create unlimited wealth and success in your life without doing any hard work.<br /><br />Success means different to different people but according to this book success means continued expansion of happiness and progressive realization of worthy goals. You must understand that success is a journey, not a destination. Success also includes good health, energy and enthusiasm to live the life completely. When you will apply these 7 laws to create what you want in your life, you will know the true meaning of success.<br /><br />The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success:-<br /><br />The Law of Pure Potentiality<br />The Law of Giving<br />The Law of Karma or Cause and Effect<br />The Law of Least Effort<br />The Law of Intention and Desire<br />The Law of Detachment<br />The Law of Dharma or Purpose in Life<br /><br /> 1.  The Law Of Pure Potentiality<br /><br />This Law is based on the fact that there is no separation between you and all the other things of this world because there is a divine energy that is flowing through all the things. The more you discover how to be in harmony with the nature, the more power you would have to create anything you want.<br /><br /> 2. The Law Of Giving<br /><br />The law of giving says that your body, your mind and this universe is in constant and dynamic change. The divine energy is continually flowing through each of us and in order to receive something, you must be willing to give something. Many people believe that if they will give, they will have less but the law of giving does not work like that. According to this law, when you will give, you will have more.<br /><br />3. The Law Of Karma Or Cause And Effect<br /><br />This is a great law. According to this law, you will reap whatever you are sowing. \\"As you sow so shall you reap.\\" If you are not happy with your life then it means you do not understand this law. Whether you like it or not but everything that is happening in your life is the result of the choices you made in past. Maybe you made those choices unconsciously.<br /><br /> 4. The Law Of Least Effort<br /><br />This Law says that if you can learn to be in the harmony with the nature, you can do less and accomplish more in your life. The nature's intelligence functions with effortless ease to create all the things that you see, touch and listen in this world. You can do the same. You can create whatever you want with effortless ease.<br /><br />This is small book containing about 80 pages but it's very powerful. The seven principles described in this book are essentials to attain what you want in your life. More than 5 million copies of this book have been sold. I highly recommend you to get a copy of this book. I have bought this book 2 years ago and have read it many times. This book has helped me to make my life more joyful and abundant in every way.in your life is the result of the choices you made in past. Maybe you made those choices unconsciously.   4.

1400049628|5.0|This is a good book for boys since it's so hard to find books that will keep my son reading. There are so many more books for girls and I'm thrilled to see my son enjoyed this book so much. It started him reading not just for school but for fun and that's every parents wish! Great book for tween boys!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game it's so fun and addicting. My daughters love it too and play it often. It is tricky and mindbending.
B000PAAH3K|4.0|This book is weighed down with anecdotes, and never delivers on it's central promise of showing you how to train yourself to make good snap decisions.<br /><br />It's still a worthwhile read (particularly if you just skim most of it).  The central premise is that our subconscious can make accurate judgments on a variety of subjects in a matter of a second or so.  He tells some interesting stories about when you should, and should not, trust these snap judgments, and the nature of some of our biases.<br /><br />Overall a good book, but it could have covered the subject matter as well in a third of the length.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so fun and exciting!!i love how there are many games in one!!!! you should play it!! i love it!
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|Wow! This was one of the best movies I've seen in awhile! It is a survival in the wilderness type movie, somewhat similar to \\"The Edge\\" with Sir Anthony Hopkins. It had my eyes GLUED to the screen, afraid to turn away for fear I might miss something. And I would watch this flick again, in a heartbeat! AND, I can't wait till the video comes out.<br /><br />The movie begins with shots of the Canadian Rocky Mountains and wolves howling, then you see frozen icy land.  Liam Neeson is a wolf sniper for a big petroleum company way up north.  Snow and ice is everywhere.  Neeson is missing his wife and has frequent visuals of her.<br /><br />In the very early beginnings of the movie, Neeson and other guys take a small plane to Archorage, Alaska and the plane goes down, crashing into frozen nowhere land.  Amidst the bitter temperatures, knee deep snow, icy waters, and brutal howling wind, Neeson and the guys attempt to survive.  But WAIT, there are vicious snapping, WOLVES, too, lurking around every corner!<br /><br />Shot amidst Vancouver and Alberta, Canada, including the beautiful Canadian Rockies, this is heart-thumping suspense.  When it was over, all I could say was \\"WOW!\\"<br /><br />BTW, watch the credits. Immediately after is a final shot that adds to the movie.<br />BTW#2 - Lots of blood so I do not recommend for younger children.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I won't rehash everything that has been written before me. This gamepad is awesome and comes in at 4.5 stars. It just needs an updated driver to fine tune the thumb stick. Other than that, I love everything about the G13.

0307352145|5.0|[This review is of the pre-publication uncorrected proof]  If you manage people, teach kids, are in a relationship, or have children, you should read this book. Though it's primarily about introverts and what's going on when they feel the way the feel and do what they do, the comparisons to extroverts provide a lot of insight into those folks as well.  Cain does a fine job of organizing and presenting the results of a lot of new brain science and behavioral studies, as well as classic research, so the average reader can grasp and use it. If you're an introvert (or have some introvert characteristics), you'll probably find many passages that feel like they were written about you. If you live with an introvert, a lot of mysteries will become far more comprehensible. A valuable resource for parents, manager, teachers, and spouses. Highly recommneded.

B002RKSCA6|5.0|To fashion a vessel of vice so that one may drink deeply and anonymously from it is a theme with Victorian resonance.  It is also the lasting impression one has on reading the story of Jekyll.  Familiarizing oneself with his ignominious fate is not only a worthy endeavor, but this version of it for your Kindle provides you the perfect sojourn for doing it.  Only a table of contents is lacking, but the brevity of the tale leaves it hardly missed.

B000MXPE74|5.0|The first (and sadly penultimate) disc by Scotland's The Fratellis is one of the best BritPop albums in the last 10 years. Think of a mix between The Libertines, Arctic Monkeys, and John Lennon: there's heavy influences of each here. It won't take long to warm up to this disc, two listens, perhaps three at the most. All of the songs are tightly craft power pop laced with irreverant lyrics. \\"Henrietta\\" starts off the disc and is a naughty number that should have you up on your feet and dancing. \\"Flathead\\" was the first single off the disc, but I find it one of the weaker tracks here. \\"Whistle for the Choir\\" is a smart little ballad. \\"Chelsea Dagger\\", well, all I can say is \\"Oh Yeah!\\". After hearing this great track you'll know what I mean. \\"For the Girl\\" is one of the disc's best tracks. It starts off with a vampish string of La-La-Las (think Libertines) followed by a heavy guitar riff. I bet it's a great number live. \\"Doginabag\\" took me a number of listens, but I now think it's a great song. Kind of blusey, with John Lennon's ghost seemingly a guest on this track, it boasts what could be labeled as The Fratellis' gestalt: \\"There's nothing really much goin' on around here, I'm holding on for dear life and one more beer\\". \\"Everybody Knows You Cried Last Night\\" might be the best track on the disc. A half-ballad half-rocker, it has one of the best (albeit too brief) solos on the album. \\"Ole Black 'n Blue Eyes\\" is a catchy pop song that has some nifty lyrics to boot: \\"I believe I was drunk, both of my heads were shrunk\\" is one example.  The songs will make you want to laugh, dance, or both. A stelar effort that will be regarded in much the same vein as \\"Up the Bracket\\" or the Artic Monkey's first disc.
B00005NMVP|5.0|A high school buddy came by my house excitedly one day, decades ago, with a new album in hand. It was Al Stewart's \\"Past, Present, and Future.\\" We sat mesmerized listening to a sound, the likes of which, we had never heard before. That began my 40 year love of Al Stewart's music. I've had \\"Year of the Cat\\" in vinyl since its release in the 70's. I just purchased the CD version and can't stop playing it.....what great music.
B00457WZEI|5.0|War Horse is one of the best books I have ever read. The language is both fluid and easy to understand and the story line is simply amazing. Anyone who loves horses or war movies must watch this...and love it. The characters are beautifully crafted, expressing personalities very similar to ones at the time of the war (WWI I believe, taking into consideration that they were still using cavalry during that time). This novel is one that you will not soon to forget.

0812992792|5.0|Excellent book. Still digesting it, and now when I go back to books I was reading before, (The Hobbit, A Dance with Dragons, Things Fall Apart) I miss Adam Johnson's style. He's not terribly descriptive, like George RR Martin, and shines in dialogue and the unraveling of plot.<br /><br />Speaking of the plot, it is extremely clever. The development of the main character figures heavily into the plot. I have heard that character's development referred to as Kafkaesque, but Jun Do's development is not entirely fictitious or unbelievable. The theme is also central throughout the book, comparisons between light and dark. I am still thinking about it so I'll add more as I digest it further.<br /><br />P.S. If you are worried about The Biography of Jun Do being the end of him, fear not. The last sentence of that section leads you to believe his story is over. When reading it, I was so shocked that I Googled to find the answer to that and was hit with a big spoiler. Jun Do's story is not over, not yet at least ;)<br /><br />Questions for other readers (*SPOILERS BELOW*):<br />1. What did the investigator smell on Jun Do's bed when he took his team from Division 42 to the houses of Comrade Buc and Commander Ga?<br />2. Did the second mate get away or not? I know it sounds like a dumb question, but the Pubyok seemed very sure that Second Mate was found on a raft.<br />3. Was Gil one of the interrogators at division 42?<br />4. Does the warden of Prison 33 die? Commander Ga gave him the uranium ore to carry around, I was sure we were going to see a horrific death from radiation, but last we heard from him, Jun Do was walking away from the warden after being allowed to leave.<br />5. What became of Mongnan? We are told she is dead, but none of the flashbacks tell you how or even when. Last we hear from her, she is telling Jun Do to assume Ga's identity.<br />6. Were the guys who drive Jun Do in the crow to the prison on their way to draw blood supposed to leave him there? We hear one say something along the lines of \\"hey, we're not done with him yet.\\"<br /><br />If anyone can answer these questions I'd be most grateful.ot done with him yet.\\"  If anyone can answer these questions I'd be most grateful.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|the packaging and delivery of the turntable are great.  We have it hooked to our Sony Receiver which all of our audio/video runs through to feed our smart tv and speakers.  This turntable has an inline amplifier built in so it will hook into the RCA ports labelled for CD.  Since we play our CDs on our DVD/CD player this works out great.  We did purchase an extension RCA audio cable (very inexpensive) as the one included is not very long.  Now for the incredible part.  Last night I took my husband downstairs where I had hooked up everything and told him to pick out an album (a real album as we over 40 people refer to them), I had purchased an authentic Discwasher (do not get a new one) and the D4 liquid.  He picked out Bruce Springsteen (which we also have on CD) and OMG the richness, the depth, the music intensity, the saxophone range, the whole experience ... it was if we were teenagers again.  We are so glad we saved many of our LPs.  We have three children and life is hectic, but last night this brought us so much relaxation - I can't wait to get another album out.  After listening to the album the CD HAS NO DEPTH.  We are so glad we purchased this turntable.  This one does have the ability to convert our albums to digital, but after last night we are in no hurry to figure out  that option, maybe one of our kids will want to, once they hear some real music!!!!
B005HJWWW8|2.0|Besides it's plastic (ugh) construction, this little amp is a huge step up from the E5. It's EQ settings are terrific, and it's compact design makes it perfect for going anywhere. Battery life is about 10 hours on a full charge, and it has a very small amount of \\"hiss\\" compared to the E5. It's still there, but you won't notice it unless nothing is being input, and you're at a high volume.<br /><br />EDIT: It was good, whilst it lasted. I was putting it through it's normal paces as a portable amp, biking around with it, securely velcro'd to my ipod, and just now I pull the cord of my ATH-M50's out of it, and the whole thing comes apart at the center. Being cheap with the plastic on this E6 was a stupid move by FiiO, I'm returning it.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Heard Tatoo, said to myself 'uh oh', this is going to get ugly.  Got the album yesterday and literally have not stopped listening to it - probably at least 20 times through.  It's astonishing how good it is.  One of, if not THE best rock album in decades, period.  They frikin pulled it off!!  Ed absolutely murders with abandon and without mercy.  DLR sounds like classic Diamond Dave and is on point throughout adding the cocky lyrics and screams/chants/rap that is his trademark.  The beats are heavy and groovy at the same time.  Solos are so intense and soaring its frightening - dang Ed, sobriety has done you well.  EVH plays as well as he ever has - and that's saying something.  Get out of the way, the King is Back.  Production quality is awesome, the record begs to be turned up to 10 (and beyond).  Try headphones cranked for a real experience.  Wolf's bass playing is excellent and the background vocals are in some ways *better* than MA's IMO - not as shrilly - gives the band a slightly different sound which is exceptional.  Bottom line, this album takes its place next to the 6-pack as an instant classic.  If its not album of the year, I'll be shocked.  Expect it to debut at #1 next week and stay there - there's has been zero marketing for this album but its sheer quality will carry the sales.  BTW, comparisons to Chickenfoot?  Please... Not even in the same universe, they are boring and predictable in comparison.  Keep eating that Poundcake and Koolaid and call me when they are a 3rd tier opening act for the headliner VH at the summer festivals ...  Nothing Van Halen did post Roth even compares to this record.  The stain of Sammy Hagar's teen-tied garbage pop rock that ruined the best band in America is suddenly and forever erased in 13, awe inspiring, face melting tracks.  Van Halen is BACK!  What a treat!  Thank you Boys.  See you in Vegas!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible it is so wonderful and I definitly recommend it TRY IT NOW it's free so whatdaya got to lose?
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Great series. Wanted to watch all at once. I think I may have liked it as much as Star Wars.
0439023483|5.0|Arrived Super Fast and in Perfect Condition. The book was amazing, fast paced story that keeps you reading all day long, I never wanted to put it down until it was finished!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Fantastic movie. Watch Firefly series first as the movie will make more sense but is still great on it's own. The cast of characters are well chosen for their parts. A great variety of personalities that seem to somehow work together even though you want to knock a couple over the head.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I loved it. Don't mistake it for a horror, it's not. Kinda gory, but I don't have a problem with that.
B002BWP49M|1.0|You get a single disk with the Theatrical Release and a few extras. What in THE world makes this a special edition?  You don't even know this is your lot until you open it and see it on the disc. :(
B00192KCQ0|3.0|The songs are too long, and there's too much jamming. The production is horrible. There's a few good songs on it.
B006W0QOF2|1.0|Imagine the Transporter.....but without dialogue......or fun.  Presto, you have Drive.  Oh, and the music blows; it feels like the music is bolted onto the film rather than a part of it.  Don't waste your time.
B000001EUN|3.0|This is a good album, but it's not great. It's not as good as the other metal albums that were released at the time. It's worth it for the price. Most of these songs are not played live by Scorpions.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|This game is pretty good, although simple. You need to walk around the wilderness finding pieces to complete puzzles. This is not a fast paced game in the least &amp; you will probably finish it quickly, but is worth playing if you have some time to kill.
B005LAIGVY|5.0|I went to see the movies at the cinema and I must say that I<br />loved the 3d conversion.<br />Spectacular.<br />I look forward to seeing all the other movie.
B005ZUR724|5.0|this is a pretty fun game. I thought 6.99 was steep for a kindle game..but after seeing the graphics, gameplay, and online experience, I think it is worth the price.  similar to the WoW game I think. if you're into mmorpgs, then you'll like this.
B0064NTZQ2|2.0|I'm not impressed because this movie was very predictable. There was no surprising twist at the end. Basicallyn good wins and the good guy gets the girl.  You've seen this a million times. What would have made this movie interesting is if the girl was secretly behind the whole plot.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|An excellently written comedy show! I've seen hundreds of tv shows and this is by far the best comedy. Only DVDs I've ever purchased.
B003Y5H51K|1.0|I'm sorry - cinematography alone cannot save a movie. This movie has gorgeous cinematography and it is, at times, a feast for the eyes.<br /><br />That's where this terrible, terrible, terrible movie stops. There is absolutely nothing else good to say about this movie. The plot is thin at best, completely and utterly unrealistic at worst. Claiming to be 'based on a real world event' yet the only similarity between that event and those depicted in the movie are that they both occurred in caves!<br /><br />The story is deeply flawed, the character developt weak at best, and situations they find themselves in simply and utterly without merit.<br /><br />Bad form!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i like it a lot....... me and the kids play for hours on our kindle fire. works great on it.
B0051ERJBI|5.0|There Sound -The Songs -The Vocals -It's All here- 2-3 Minute Songs That Rip Your Face And Your Ears Off -It's All Yours For The Taking-
B005K17RU0|2.0|On kindle fire everytime I try to open the app it forces close!! From what I have seen I liked it. Guess I need to find a new one.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I got sucked into Downton after many clients told me about it.  I now have the Bluray for both seasons and it is on almost daily as clients who haven't seen it, or see the episodes during the appointments come in.  I've been cursed a few times for causing people to go home and spend hour after hour doing nothing so they can continue watching.  The cinematography is sublime, the acting fantastic and the stories keep moving.  Fabulous show for both men and women - some of my clients have had to promise their husbands not to watch anymore at my salon since they don't want to continue without them.  I hope Downton continues for many years to come and will look forward to season 3 airing in the UK in September.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|So much fun! I loved this game! It isn't to long or to short! It even gives you hints if you need it! They are in your journal!
B000N2VMZW|4.0|Surely one of the oddest concept albums to emerge in the 1970s, this 1972 Chrysalis release by Jethro Tull features a single seamless song on both sides based upon the satyric poem \\"Thick As A Brick\\" by fictional author Gerald \\"Little Milton\\" Bostock. Both cover, inside and back covers and large fold-out insert are designed to look like a small U.K. village newspaper, the St. Cleve Chronicle & Linwell Advertiser, complete with product advertisements, puzzles, cartoons, horoscopes, classified ads and articles. All wrapped in that deliciously notorious British sense of humor.<br /><br />The main story, which begins on the cover and is continued inside, tells about young Gerald (8 years of age), nicknamed Little Milton, and how his first prize for the poem was revoked after a reading of his composition on the BBC where he used a word deemed offensive (only described as \\"g__r\\") by The Society For Literary Advancement And Gestation (SLAG). The entire poem is printed inside with a review article revealing that the band Jethro Tull has released an album based upon the poem by Julia Stone-Mason B.A.<br /><br />All this is the brainchild of band leader Ian Anderson (flute, acoustic guitar, saxophone, trumpet and vocals), and members  Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond (bass), Barriemore Barlow (drums, timpani, percussion), Martin Barre (electric guitar, lute), and John Evan (organ, piano, harpsichord).
B005OOSPZO|5.0|Just made my order today on Amazon for the blu ray.  Have this on vcd, dvd, vhs and I also think it was on betamax.  Not sure if anyone can put me right here, but I thought I may have seen this movie in a cinema in the UK on what they then called the wide screen.  Some cinemas in the UK at that time would adertise the show as a wide screen production and I remember the curtains would open really wide as if they surrounded the cinema.  Aftet that is was wow for a great experiance if like me you liked to view from what we called the gods, the upper circle.  Anyway looking forward after great reviews to see it on my blu ray system.  I will come back and review my total experiance.
B0063IH60K|4.0|A quick and easy, fast playable game of the classic Klondike solitaire.  Would be almost perfect it it could figure out when you lose. Love the one-tap move feature.
B0017TYPIG|5.0|Bought from Amazon US and I took a gamble on it.  I play my Blu Ray movies on a PS3 with a Sony HD 1080 TV.  My PS3 played the movie even though my coding is not Region A and it does say US and Canada only (confused)  Moving on.  Still looking to purchase a region free blu ray player in Asia when I can afford but was so excited this one run for me, thanks Warner.  I was 11 years old when this was produced and first seen the movie in the cinema a few years later.  My cinema experiance was on a wet Wed afternoon in the North East of England whilst skipping School at the local Odeon my place of escape as a confused teenager.  What a fantastic story, just amazing and I then understood why I was a rebel of some sort who wanted more from Life and was willing to work for it.  Romance over, grown up now and can still be a rebel at times.  Not sure what the budjet was for this movie and how they even managed to edit it.  Must have been a lot of dumped takes.  For instance look at the boxing, the low camera angles in the early part of the fight on a Sat afternoon.  Luke gets up from another knock down and peers at the ankle chains of a bystander, was that a mistake as later on all were seen to be free.  The punch shots in your face, cinema at its best and we are talking the 1960 era here.  The acting was fantastic, looks like they all had fun making this one.  Wish I could see some out takes also.  Before I move to the Blu Ray experiance I would say for one this movie has been underestimated as one of the greats since cinema rolled out the first.  Place it in the action/story cat and over the las 50 years this one should be in the top ten if not top five.  The movie story justs move on with great directing to a point in a cinema you will never leave your seat for a snack or the bathroom.  Pee in the bottle you are holding empty (rebel)and starve as in my case I did not because some kind lady sold me something that used up my bus fare home.  What a walk home though, give me time to think my rebel ways were not the way to go even though my Parents in my eyes did not understand me.  I asked my Mother for boiled eggs and I think She gave me two fried with chips.  Always like a boiled egg after this movie.  I had to educate them on how smart I was (later)  The blu Ray transforamtion is fantastic, my opinion as I have it on vcd, dvd, vhs.  Look at the sweat coming off the guys on blu ray, amazing.  The whole blu ray experiance is a must for such a great movie that has probably faded in the history of great movies.  All I will say is buy it and you will play this again and again to lets say a visitor aud because you can never be bored with great acting and directing.  Have some iced cool drinks on hand also as this will make you feel hot.  My two teenage kids just watched it also and asking daddy who is Paul Newman.  I told them He is the Brad Pitt of that era and it seemed to have gone down well.  Cinemas world wide should have a day when they show epics on a grand scale to give the younger generation a chance to see movie making at its best without the usual digital imposed scenes that we see now.  Oh well, I think you will all agree I am an old fart but an old person who loves cinema at its best and has seen the benefits of upscaling to blu ray to view old great movies like this without deleting.  Enjoy.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Downloaded and reinstalled numerous times. The App appeared to install OK. However, as many users have noted - the App would not consistently load, or if it did load it would crash at some point. Also, it would not update the time or weather data - stuck at the initial reading.  Uninstalled the App.
B005K17RU0|1.0|This ap used to work well on Kindle, but now it always force closes when I try to open it.  The widget seems to work fine, but I get a force close when I click it to open ap.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I am not a big Tv person, movies, yes, but tv, not much.  This is a wonderful series.  I had watched Part I, and pre ordered part 2.  I am so glad that I did.  It is the type of series, that I am sad as I approach the end of it.  I am looking forward to season 3, which I heard is including Shirley MacClaine, of all people, but I think she will be great.  If you really enjoy total entertainment, order this.  It is bigger than life, the film quality, how they formed all the characters, the relationships, are incredible.  I cannot praise it enough.  I can understand why it has won so many awards---meaning season 1.  Even tho I am older, 64, and have no grandchildren, this is something you could watch with them, make some popcorn, and enjoy.  As I got more engrossed, I even made myself some tea and ate some sandwhiches as they were doing on screen..lol....If you have the opportunity, see it on a larger HD tv, so much better.  I am watching on a 50 inch plasma, and love it.  Order it soon, total entertainment.
B00383UJ2U|5.0|I love all their songs, beautiful written lyrics and amazing voice. I would buy every CD from HURTS. Theo Hutchcraft is so talented and his voice gives me goosebumps when I listen to him sing... totally adore HURTS
B0061S073A|5.0|This is a great app that saves me money!  I decided to get this app after my 3 year old daughter purchased a video on Amazon inadvertently.  This app allows me to put the Amazon video icon in it but not the browser or store icon.  So, I can feel safe giving this to my children knowing that I won't have a bill to surprise me.  It works because I tried it myself to purchase something and the browser won't launch for a purchase.  But for the Amazon free videos, it loads just fine.  My children can watch all the free video they want (within a certain time limit) but not any video that I would have to pay for. I love it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very well put together. Better than others I have seen. I highly recommend it. I like the multiple translations. Great! L8
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This is a fun and often challenging game that can test your patience and problem solving. We like that it is family appropriate without violence.
B0071QIN00|2.0|Serious.. I would have liked this game if the tilt controls worked more accurately. try again..And the saying &quot;extreme!&quot; all the time was so unrealistic and over the top lame.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game, and very addicting! It was easy to learn how to play since I've never played this before. I recommend this app.
B006UG90RM|1.0|This album is so bad... DLR's voice is shot... The production is dire - Eddie sounds like Satriani.... The tracks are hookless.... Maybe there's a reason Ted Templeman discarded them in the fist place. And where's Mike ?? He was VH's secret weapon....
B006OAB3ME|4.0|This is exactly what Paul intended it to be. He's inviting anyone who'd like to come along for the ride. A leisurely one, but a smooth ride all the same. I'm glad he did this. Enjoy it.  And the next album won't be far off.  I hear it'll be a scorching rocker.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I really love this show.  Like so many new shows on TV, I ignored it.  I didn't know what it was about, maybe because I Tivo everything and fast forward past commercials and hadn't seen Fox's promos.  Anyway, by chance I read a review online and immediately ordered the first season from Amazon.  My husband and I started to watch it together and I was hooked.  Just like Lost, this show has episodes that move the story forward and others that you wonder what the heck is going on.  My husband soon dropped out (essentially when they reached the parallel universe concept - he is not a scifi lover and got too confused).  I continued watching and it was really worth it - the show gets stronger and stronger.  I already ordered the second season and am looking forward to starting it soon.  It's a great show with characters you'll grow to love, especially Walter the scientist who's spent many years in an asylum and is adjusting to life outside while helping the Fringe division solve their crazy mysteries.
B001AIG41K|5.0|I love this group!  Heard about them when I read that they performed on the Legends of Rock cruise last year.  All of my exploring on the internet made me more intrigued, so I jumped in and bought this CD and I've been in love ever since - can't stop listening, wearing this CD out.  It's my go-to when I'm road traveling (which I do frequently for business) and I've actually been putting it on and turning off the sound for my exercise video.  You can't not dance to this.  All of the tracks are awesome - the two that really stand out are American Outlaw and the extended TYA.  I'd love to see these guys live - appears that they don't often venture out of TX.  Hope these guys will be getting more national exposure - they're too good not to be out there.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I'm a constant reader and especially like mysteries, fantasies and science fiction.  For me this book combines all three elements.  The book starts out slowly and I must admit I had to force myself to go forward after the first fifty pages or so.  However, I persisted and found myself getting more and more involved with the characters.  Sure there are flaws, some rather banal dialogue, and a premise that is recognizable from other books, but when taken as a whole, the book is engaging.  If I reach the end of a book and am impatient to find out what comes next, I consider the book a success.  Yes, the author is working on a sequel and I'll probably read that too.  Give the book a chance, it may take time to get into it, but you'll find it's worth it.
B00164KYV4|5.0|This is a good movie for the woman who are tired of thinking they found the one. And in the end you look like a crazy girl because you want him so bad and he is trying to get away. I wish this movie was out before i got married. It could have prevented a lot of heartach. This is a must see movie.
B0071QIN00|4.0|Love these games. I got the first one as faotd as well as this one. In my opinion they just keep getting better. Can't wait to see the next one and what new things will be added to make the game an even more complete package. Great work Dev.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Worked for a little while but now force closes on my when ever I want to look at the doppler. I loved it in the beginning but won't tolerate it not working. Uninstalled. DROID incredible
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its good if you get bord easly, you have lots of great games. though make shore to read the directions for the games.
0061726834|2.0|I picked up this book thinking that the plot was something new and fresh. I thought it would exciting, captivating, and intriguing. Unfortunately, I was wrong.  This is not a completely negative review so keep reading.  Let's start with the things I did like about this book.  I liked the concept. The idea that something we feel, experience, and look for, is not natural, that it's wrong - a disease, I thought that was interesting. I picked up this book because I was intrigued and I wanted to know where Oliver was going with it.  I like the quotes she put in the beginning of each chapter. They're excerpts from the books and manuals that citizens of her dystopian society live by. I thought it was clever, it provided some information about the inner workings of this world and how they really view love.  I liked Hana's and Lena's friendship. I liked that they were close (as much as young people can be in this dystopian society anyway) and that they have been friends since grade school. But they weren't so close that they had the same personality, they sort of complemented one another. I thought it was fitting that after everything that has happened to Lena and her family, she has someone who doesn't look at her like everyone else does, someone who can stand up for her. She needed someone who can coax her out her shell a little bit.  Another thing I liked was the description of Lena's apprehension about how her relationship with Hana will change after she is cured. It was touching, it was sad. It was believable. It's not that we worry about not remembering our childhood friends after we turn eighteen. The believable part is the difficulty of having to say goodbye to someone you've known for so long.  I understood those moments and as I read them I just wanted to scream at Lena, \\"Hug her, tell her that you love her! Do it, now!\\"  Of course for Lena, it's not just that goodbyes are difficult, it's also that she doesn't know what to say. She doesn't know how to express how much Hana has meant to her because she doesn't know what love is like.  The last time they see each other made me tear up. That is more than I can say about the ending.  Moving on to the things that I did not like - I thought the concept was poorly executed. The plot seemed to drag on and on. There wasn't anything exciting happening. For what seemed like a really long time, Lena was just waiting for her operation. I'm not looking for action because obviously this isn't an action, adventure story, but there was something lacking in the progression of the plot.  Unfortunately, it seemed like it was stretched out by repetitive descriptions. Again, Lena counting down the days, her and Hana not talking, the description of the streets, the season, the robotic, monotone people.  At 441 pages there was no clear description of how this world came to be - how did scientists discover this disease? What happened in the world that made the government put up borders, change their beliefs, and of all the things we could be looking for a cure for, why love?  I don't know and that annoys me. I should have answers after all those pages.  - tinybooknook.blogspot.com
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a good app but the controls are little hard. There is a little lag when controlling the icons, but overall it's a good app for free.
B0071QIN00|5.0|Awesome game, responsive controls. good graphics. definitley a good game. too many review trolls.  I used button mode not tilt controls as I have a kindle fire.
B006O3MU96|1.0|ok don't waste your money on this app if u get the original it comes with Christmas and like 7 other themes.  DO NOT GET!!!!!!!!
0439023521|4.0|Pulled me in with just a few lines. I could not put this book down!!! Happy reading all you wonderful people out there!
B0063IH60K|5.0|when I first got this game, I got it because Ive played it on the computer .........its waa&aacute;aaaaay better, awesome!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this is a good game except for some levels like the aqarium level with the smiley face and the fish you just can not get the face around the fish.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|When I first received it, I was a little disappointed that it was so plain Black. Now it is just what I had in mind. Light weight for traveling, easy to hold, click my stylus to band and go. I would recommend it to anyone who was going to carry their kindle fire a lot. Amazon is great. Great choices, and prices. Easy to order on line, or through the Kindle. The strap also helps to keep the kindle secure in your hand while walking around reading, which I do a lot. Give it 5 stars.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has wonderful features: so many different Bible versions, notes, highlights/bookmarks, catch me up (for when you've slacked off) that brings you back to where you left off....I can't say enough about all of it! I highly recommend the Study \\"Living a Divinely Inspired Life\\"...it sets a wonderful tone and course in your walk with the Lord : )
B0054JZC6E|3.0|As the game goes it is okay but is not the best because you have to earn points from games to get more games. but get it anyways.
B005HV6YO8|1.0|When one think of the Best of... Especially after 25 years, there should be 2 maybe 3 discs of material ~ b-sides, outtakes, live, remix, acapella  et al., Nothing stands out here which you will find on other \\"Best of\\"... Another marketing toy 2 keep Sting on the radar & pocket some chump change.  Put your previous \\"Best of\\" collections on rotation & you will have this one.  Beginners only should  wait for a bargin basement buy.  Seasoned worshippers should avoid unitl you do a trade in.
B006UG90RM|2.0|Seems most of the five star reviews have more to say about Hagar than the new music.As a fan of the early years this didn't even live up to my tempered expectations.  The production is terrible.DLR's voice is gone. Where are the harmonies ? The lone bright spot is EVH's playing seems back to be getting back where it once was.  If this wasn't a Van Halen record it would never have seen the light of day.  Sad effort by a once formidable band.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|At first, I loved this game. Then it kept shutting down on me and trying to make me buy other apps. One star for app performance and one for the games. (I kept on trying to get back on because I loved them so much, but I got so fustrated that I deleted it from my kindle fire.)
B0064MT1NU|1.0|I feel this is a great masterpiece of a film which is mistakenly missing the subtitles, so if you can't interpret the main character's sign language or if you don't speak the tongue of the New Zealand natives then you're going to have a problem with this Lion's Gate release.  A few other reviews posted here are calling the blu-ray release inferior due to picture quality issues which I don't understand one bit.  Sure, there are some low-lit scenes which appear grainy but that is simply the nature of celluloid.  Even the master print will show that.  Point is, I wish I could return this copy in exchange for a corrected version.  Is someone at Lion's Gate Studio listening...or do they even care to fix the problem?  I'm going to try returning my copy for a refund.
B004SKJTY6|1.0|I spent 5 minutes watching the \\"review\\" thinking I was about to also watch The KIng's Speech\\" {the actual movie}.  Spent another 10 minutes trying to figure out why the movie hadn't started.  It ain't a free movie !  Not like Amazon to pull this sort of thing.  Very disappointing.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I purchased this DVD because I had seen the movie and wanted to see it again.It is a very moving story of an \\"orphan \\" who knows in his heart that he really  is not an orphan.He feels in his heart that he has a Mother and Father \\"some where\\".His parents both are musicians and deep down in his spirit that music plays over and over again.The boys at the home he lives in discourages and makes fun of him.But he \\"knows \\" he will find them some day some where.He leaves on a journey to some how find them. A very inspiring movie !

B004GP3DTK|2.0|This is not very good. I am a huge Mr Big fan and I was really excited to find that they had recorded a new album, so I went right out and bought it.<br />Blah. The problem is the songs. Sure, there are numerous cool moments of interplay between Gilbert and Sheehan, and Eric Martin's voice sounds good and melodic, but the songs basically stink. Nothing memorable here at all. I can't even remember the name or even the melody line to one song, and that is after repeated listens.<br />Other than Lean into It and their debut (even that was spotty as far as song selection) Mr Big's albums have always been a bit uneven.<br />Unfortunately, this one just shows why they broke up in the first place; they really had nothing else to offer.<br />Maybe it will be big in Japan....

B005OCFGTO|5.0|All the people who are putting negative comments on this dvd set just because it doesn't have extras are ridiculous. The title says it all: 8 complete films, period. I am VERY satisfied with just the films, that's all I need. And I only paid 39.00 for 8 movies - that's one heck of a deal!<br /><br />I love the case it comes in personally. Stylish, and convenient in the way it stores all the discs. All my discs came with pictures on them (none of them blank), so i'm happy with that. Good quality too.<br /><br />So if you're a Harry Potter fan I recommend this DVD set, for sure.

B001E75QH0|5.0|Such a fun ride!  I hadn't seen Raiders in many years and forgot how great the movie actually was.  They're all great, but the last one - not so much. It was kind of silly.  But if you're a Harrison Ford fan like me, it won't bother you.  It's a great collection!

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I got this game for my Fire and so far I have really enjoyed it. The ads are barely noticeable and I can actually play the games. The game instructions could be a little more instructive, and some games are nearly impossible to play, but the good news is you don't have to play them all if you don't want to.

0670022950|4.0|Having now listened to CD's 1-26 (of 30), here are my thoughts: 1) Pinker is excellent in laying out his thesis and defending it reasonably (probably better when not in his primary area of study - cognitive science); 2) would probably have had more impact if he limited the book to 200 pages or so; gets sprawling, as if \\"stream of consciousness\\", in parts; 3) too much unquestioning reliance on ideas of \\"psychopathy.\\"<br /><br />To elaborate, contrary to what Pinker says, psychopathy is NOT a DSM diagnosis.  It is tied to Robert Hare, from Canada (like Pinker), who developed a psychopathy checklist from interviews with incarcerated people.  Defense counsel, especially in the death penalty area, have done a good job laying out why the theory is 1) not predictive for general population and 2) not helpful re pointing to a cure.  It is a \\"catch all\\" or \\"default\\" label, generally slapped on people by prosecutors and police.  It is like saying in the 1600s that x is a warlock or witch.  Saying someone is a sociopath or psychopath is just saying (in essence) that a person is bad, do not know why, do not know how to fix the problem, no cure possible. Maybe Texas should execute this guy - let's call Dr. Death (Park Dietz [...] or Dan Martell [who, too his credit, will concede limits of the psychopathy idea in forensic settings]).<br /><br />Similar to anti-social personality disorder diagnosis.  Psychopathy study is more pseudo science than science, as one can tell when Pinker mentions CEOs who can be classified as psychopaths.  End of rant.<br /><br />Glad the book is out there - lots of good news about the good old days being grim compared to now. Amazing how we tend to block out the violence that is in our past.<br /><br />From Wikipedia:<br /><br />However, there is no consensus about the symptom criteria for psychopathy, and no psychiatric or psychological organization has sanctioned a diagnosis of \\"psychopathy\\" itself.'[3]<br /><br />Psychologist Robert Hare has been a particular champion of the concept of psychopathy, based largely on a characterization introduced by Hervey Cleckley mid 20th century. The Hare Psychopathy Checklist is a standard ratings tool most often used in forensic settings to assess psychopathy. A study by Hare and colleagues suggested that one to two percent of the US population score high enough on a screening version of the scale to be considered potential psychopaths.<br /><br />In addition, Hare's concept of psychopathy has been criticised as being only weakly applicable to real-world settings and tending towards tautology. It is also said to be vulnerable to 'labeling effects'; to be over-simplistic; reductionistic; to embody the fundamental attribution error; and to not pay enough attention to context and the dynamic nature of human behavior.[134], based largely on a characterization introduced by Hervey Cleckley mid 20th century.

B001G7SS9G|5.0|I enjoyed this movie alot!  Sure it's not like the book, but itself it was a great experience.  If you're looking for a post-apocalyptic movie, this is by far one the the must haves.  Great Graphics  Great Acting  Great Plot  The box-set itself I give a 10/10  For $10 it's unmissable  All the merchandise you get has had effort put into it, and is quality made.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|i like this app it is pretty good except for when the computer only only has a king and a pawn or something and i have 2 queens a king a rook and a pawn when I'm about to get the king in checkmate and it says draw by stalemate. argg

030771652X|3.0|Sister is a murder mystery, a medical thriller, and the story of the love that exists between sisters. Rosamund Lupton is an author who is new to me, so I really took a chance purchasing it for my Kindle.  Beatrice is the older sister. Raised in London, she has moved to New York and made a life for herself there. She has a demanding job, a fiance, and a lovely apartment. One Sunday, she receives a phone call from her mother. Her younger sister, Tess, has gone missing.  But Tess is young, irresponsible. She is an art student living in a cheap flat in London. Although her mother does not know this at the time, Tess is pregnant by a married man, one of her instructors.  Beatrice flies to London as quickly as possible. And the search for Tess begins.  Although they live an ocean apart and lead very different lives, Tess and Beatrice are unusually close. Part of their bond is due to the childhood death of their brother Leo from Cystic Fibrosis. Tess' baby was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis in utero, and Tess was part of a clinical trial of a gene therapy designed to cure the dread disease.  Does Tess' disappearance have anything to with the trial? Or is her married lover to blame? What about the fellow student who has been stalking her?  There are lots of questions. And it takes until the end of the book to learn the answers. Along the way there are false leads and red herrings. As Beatrice searches for the answers, she undergoes some life defining moments. Her personal relationships change as her obsession with Tess grows.  There are so many layers here, it is sometimes hard to figure out what Lupton is trying to accomplish. It this book truly about the sisterly bond? Or maybe it is about the evils of the British National Health System and gene therapy. Anyway, it does seem a bit muddled. However, it is a quick read-good for an airplane ride or the beach. I did not guess the ending, but then I really didn't try. I didn't care that much about any of the characters, but since I paid for the book, I wanted to finish it.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|This game is really fun cause u can move ur finger and make things with it. This is really fun
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Very stylish and easy to use cover for the Kindle Fire. Easily folds to a stand for reading. Also can use the strap to hold the Kindle for long term reading.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|The World at War is the best historic series availble on DVD. I first saw this series around 1976, and when the 30th anniversary edition became available recently, I bought it. It is even better than the original series, due to the added features. The BBC outdid itself on this one. Alas, there are some serious historical shortcomings in the series. First, the series is told mostly with a British viewpoint. The result is that the desert battles were a big focus of the series, but they were relatively minor to the outcome of the War.  Second, the recovery of the Soviet armaments industry after the German invasion was a great influence in the outcome of the War. Third, the USA's immense output of arms and materials, much of which was supplied to the Soviets and the Brits, was barely mentioned, but it was of great importance in the outcome of the war. Even the Russians acknowledge that the war would have lasted an additional year without the lend lease aid provided to them by the USA. By then, American troops would have been occupying Kiev and Berlin would have been nuclear rubble.  Finally, the British and American breaking of the German codes influenced every battle, including Kursk, considered to be the most significant land battle of World War II, and the Battle of the Atlantic. The defeat of the U-Boats could not have happened without the breaking of the German Naval Codes.  I do not know if the original producers knew about this codebreaking success, but the information became public in 1975,and this was never incorporated into this 30th anniversary edition.  But, this is THE BEST World War II series out there. Someday, I hope the BBC expands upon the original series.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the plans and number of available versions. Would and have highly recommended it to others. A very useful tool.
1451627289|4.0|I finished reading this book ten minutes ago, and I liked it just fine.  I hadn't read a Stephen King in over 13 years, as his style finally bored me, and Gerald's Game put the nail in the coffin, but the premise of 11/22/63 lured me in.  Would I recommend 11/22/63 to anyone to read?  Absolutely.  It's a fun read, littered with thought provoking passages, and the topic, coupled with time travel, is a sure winner. I am not going to rehash the plot, many have done that just fine, but I would like to point out a few things that I thought about as I read the book.  11/22/63 is fraught with minor problems, but it's a damn fine read of epic proportion.  I suppose it is a matter of style, technique, and the author's purpose, but much of the rambling narrative could have been eliminated and nothing would have been lost.  King went on and on about characters and scenes that didn't really come into play for the over-all picture of the novel.  It is an 849 page book, which could have easily been accomplished in less than 500 pages.  However, the length of the book lends it to becoming a movie of epic proportion, which could be good.  However, his excessive descriptions of characters and scenes is one of the things about Stephen King's books that caused me to quit reading them; they are usually unnecessarily long.  My standard reply when people ask me if I like Stephen King is, \\"yes, I like his books very much, but he talks too much.\\"  In his many novels, King frequently gives enormous character detail that often lacks a purpose at the end of the story; it's like we could have easily gone without it; it's merely fluff.  I was reminded of that while reading 11/22/63.  Being a high school teacher, I very much enjoyed the high school scenes, particularly the politics of a high school that only teachers, administrators, and students really understand and recognize.  I thought the love scene between Jake (George), the protagonist and Sadie, his target of affections, was fine.  It has been painted by many of the one-star-reviewers that it was excessive, and I was led to believe that there were many love scenes, but neither was true for me.  I remember only one lengthy scene and another as a call and response to the first one, but most of the others were merely references.  I've never been impressed by King's love scene narratives, they seem clumsy and amateurish, even middle school level pornographic, but I can also understand the inclusion of the one in this story.  Perhaps the worst love scene I've ever read in any modern pop fiction was the culminating love scene in It; sincerely bad.  I would not let the comments about the love scenes in this book sway you from reading it.  The ending sucked.  I mean, we have all of this build up to the big moment, and the intensity gets lost in his nagging tendency to talk too much.  It's not just style that hurt the ending for me, it was what happened.  I didn't like it, and I envisioned many different scenarios that could have been better.  But that's a personal opinion, and I'm sure others will like the ending just fine.  I bet they change it for the subsequent film, though.  Surely, had the book taken a different ending, it would have rendered itself to a possible sequel, if not a mini-series.  I guess that possibility is still there.  This novel should be huge at the box office.  I heard it was picked up by Jonathan Demme, though it could have been his brother.  The story is great, the topic is great, the premise is great.  It should flock people to the theaters, particularly if they cast the right people, which so often doesn't happen.  So, yeah.  If you like Stephen King, or even if you've never read a book by him, this a good read, lots of fun, it had me wanting to go back to it and finish it.  In the right environment, I could have easily found myself reading this book non-stop until I finished it, that is in several long sessions.  It takes me awhile to read 849 pages.
B0071QIN00|5.0|fun game one of the best faotd.everyone should atleast give it a try if you don't like it delete it.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Works great on my Fire.  Easy navigation and controls. Good distraction between books and movies. And its free! What more could you ask? .
1439152799|4.0|I love the way Kate Morton writes. Distant Hours has two story-lines...one that takes place in 1992 when the main character's mother receives a letter that had been mailed, but not delivered, fifty years prior. This letter sets off a series of events which leads the main character to find out more about her mother and part of her mother's life that she knew nothing about.  The second story-line is essentially about her mother's past...about the three sisters that the main character's mother went to stay with for 1 year during the start of WWII. The story was very engaging. I thought Forgotten Garden was better, but this story did not disappoint.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|My husband and grandson (age 8) went to see this at the theater. Both loved it, which is why I bought a copy. They watched it again right before the Superbowl, both said it is still as good the second time around.

B006OAB3ME|5.0|If you don't like Paul you won't like this album.  Simple as that.  But for those of us who have followed his career this is a very personal, assessible album that brings him full circle to his pre-Beatles days and the songs that influenced him.  No it is not rock and roll (to use the antiquated term) but does everything have to be rock and roll?  No.  It may seem to some that he is once again singing \\"silly love songs\\" but to me he is just going back to his roots and having a wonderful time.  One problem that people have had in examing the post Beatles careers of all four is that each had certain gifts they brought to the table and when they split and those gifts became front and center it seemed excessive when compared to the balance brought by the four together.  That will be a problem to Beatles fans who did not like the softer side of the group.  But these are beautiful old songs and he does them well.  So, the bottom line is if you like Paul and/or the \\"standards\\" you will probably like this maybe even love it like I do. If not there are plenty of other cds for your listening pleasure.  At near 70 I think Paul deserves to do what he wants to do and for me he gets all the kisses he wants.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|These games are fun and fairly easy to play so it doesn't require a lot of thought. I play them on my Kindle Fire and it works great. Sure you gotta posy games to get points and unlock other games, but who cares. It gives you something to work toward and it is NOT hard to earn points.
6304602944|4.0|Tango and Cash is definately a typical \\"guy\\" flick but can be enjoyed by women who love action. Stallone and Russell do a great job as usual but the story line is predictable. Unfortunately, I could guess what was going to happen through most of the movie. Still worth watching.
B006IVBSBU|2.0|With the cast here, I was hoping for something at least good, but this wasn't it for sure. Just IMPOSSIBLE things, and jumps all around. I don't dislike many movies, but this was one of them I'm sorry to say.
B0045HCJGC|5.0|Demolition Man is an action packed Stallone and Snipes flick that doesn't just deliver on the typical punching-kicking-chasing of their other films. Humor is sprinkled through this movie like peanuts in trail mix. Wesley Snipes is evil and rediculous at the same time while Stallone's character makes you feel sad for his predicament, awed by his abilities and amused by his lack of control and difficulty fitting in. Sandra Bullock is just too funny in this one. Sit down with a bowl of popcorn and get ready to laugh and cheer the characters on. If you figure out the \\"three seashell\\" thing...let me know!
B00006FDCD|1.0|i was shocked by the first omission of the beginning scene where the little girl was attacked and killed by Pennywise, the clown from hell, AKA \\"IT\\".  we also missed the scene about Georgy and his relationship with his older brother. we also missed where Georgy was sending his paper boat down stream in the gutter where we should have been introduced to that horrible clown and his terrifying pointed teeth, who was in the gutter, waiting to consume small children.  a lot of the show was rendered impotent and embarrassingly silly because there was nothing leading up to the so-called scary scenes to add to the tension and making them really scary.  Pennywise was still really creepy.  i wish i could have seen the scenes that were cut from the original TV movie.  i would never have ordered it, had i known it was incomplete.  at least, now you are warned!
0061433047|5.0|The last Tiffany Aching & Nac mac Feegle story?  Say it isn't so!  This was a great read, full of real wisdom about what it really means to be \\"the witch\\", making the hard choices and standing up for those who can't.  This is a darker story than we've seen before with these characters, but it's fitting because the adult world is full of hard decisions.  If this truly is the last we'll see of Tiffany and her little blue friends, then at least they're in a good place.  Another fine Discworld entry with Pratchett's trademark humanism and humor.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|It still baffles me as to why Britney titled this album \\"In the zone\\", if she's going by the classic definition of being in a place where you work harder than you have ever before to accomplish something amazing, this isn't it. True, Britney has polished her sound and has made great strides in improving her music for a more mature outlook on her image, but \\"In the zone\\" is still very easy and entertaining listening music, and Brit did not collaborate with her produces and songwriters on this album as much as she did on her 2001 album \\"Britney\\". But here's the silver lining, Brit has pumped up the sex appeal enough to make it obvious enough for adults, but still subtle enough for teens and tweens alike to listen to without feeling like their hearing an audio from a pornography. She also ditches the sweet, soft ballads and has exhanged them for club-hitting dance numbers which perfectly transform her from a teen idol to a superstar that can be in the ranks with Madonna and Sheryl Crow. Also, she provides irrestiably catchy guilty pleasures such as \\"Touch of my hand\\", \\"Outrageous\\", and \\"Showdown\\", all of which are highlights from \\"In the Zone\\". Her 2 ballads are \\"Shadow\\" and \\"Everytime\\", the latter of which is my highest recommended track and is sonically her best song to date. Brit also gets you moving with \\"Brave New Girl\\" and \\"Toxic\\". So this album as a whole works well with Brit's new found womanhood and her efforts to branch out into more mature pop. Yes, there are some throwaways (\\"Early Mornin\\" and \\"The Hook Up\\"), but you will definitely be satisfied as a listener.

0684803356|3.0|This book is ostensibly a modern American lit classic, but I find other works are more deserving of such nostalgia than this book.  (See: East of Eden, Grapes of Wrath, Slaughterhouse Five, et al.)  Foremost, the pacing of this book is critically flawed.  This book incredibly BORING in the second half!<br /><br />The ability of Hemingway to paint a vivid picture of the setting of this story really captivated me for the first half, and, along with learning about the characters, he distracted me from possible plot progression problems.  Unfortunately, that gimmick runs out about half-way through.<br /><br />If you consult a synopsis of this book like I did, you'll realize that the first 200 pages consume more than 3/4ths of the plot description!  That leaves nearly *300 pages* wherein *less than a quarter* of the substantive events occur.  Considering this book is set over only 3 days, that leaves the reader a whole lot of minutiae to grind through just to say you finished it.<br /><br />Perhaps there are readers for whom this type of book is fine -- or even preferred -- but I am not one.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great games for the price!! Glad that it is compatible with the Kindle. Many games, all different. Good idea to make you work to unlock other games.
B004LWZW9C|5.0|I was skeptical about seeing this film because of the numerous negative reviews it received. However, I have to say that this film was excellent. I personally do not like the comparisons to Valentine's Day because I thought that was a horrible movie. New Year's Eve was poignant and introspective. Although, some parts may be cheesy, and yes, it takes awhile for all the storylines to develop, I laughed out loud throughout the whole movie. So I recommend that you give a shot, if you were on the fence like me. I hope that you are pleasantly surprised.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like it, its quite fun and I enjoy it a lot.  I would really recomened this game to friends.

B0026ICAOS|5.0|Product arrived new, on time, and as described in the listing. Not much else to say about a movie. Wish I could find #2 on bluray.
006190385X|4.0|A good book with good pictures. Black print on a dark red page is tough to read, not sure what genius thought that was a good choice. Check your hardback version and see if you have the 10-13 pages re Zooropa era missing - cause they were in mine. Not vandalism either but a production error. Enjoyed it, but as is the case with all of U2's recorded output, too much Bono, not enough Edge. One star less for that. Sorry Bono.
B0071QIN00|5.0|This is a very well-crafted scaling down of similar games on Xbox, etc.  The courses are absurd and the physics unrealistic but very predictable but those do not detract at all from the fun and excitement the game offers.  In fact, I believe that the extremely over-the-top challenges can really get the adrenalin pumping . . . with a minor downside for me being that in the heat of battle I find myself really clamping down on the onscreen controls and before long I have pain and cramps in my hands.  Despite that minor hazard I think the game is quite impressive and a lot of fun.  On an unrelated note, though I wish he would default to five-star reviews when publishing his little melodramas, I often find  Superman75 quite entertaining.  I suspect that any decent app can weather his one-star reviews but he really ought to make then five-stars in cases like this one where the rating isn't really integral to the story.  Even better would be to make the star-rating relevant to the app even though the review is not.  More importantly, however, he needs some fresh material rather than doing so many variants on past themes.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is awesome. many translations to choose from, lots of devotions. &agrave;nd so easy to stick yo a reading plan.<br />5 stars
B001F6TXME|5.0|this is exactly what you need. Its a remote, and it has a lock feature that allows you to do super long exposures. Its built solid, easy to use (plug and play). I bought this over the cheaper ones because they had some reviews about the connectors breaking.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is very entertaining and has so much variety I hope everyone enjoys this game as much as I do :)
B0071QIN00|4.0|for the kindle fire it takes long to download, but it is very cool.and fun.I like the options for the tilt OR the buttons, so that's cool very exiting and fun!  u never know what you have to do on the next Lvl :) I recommend this game to every1! I gave this a four star Bc it took long to load but fun game!
0062082353|5.0|I found this book to be a very frank and open account of Mr. Kyle's life and personal sacrifices that he and his wife both made to protect fellow patriots in the front lines of a very brutal and difficult war.  These folks are cut above and have lived through what most of us can only imagine.  I hold them in the highest regard and pray that God will bless and protect them the rest of their days.
0385534639|4.0|I loved this book. I love all the magic and \\"illusions\\". The romance didnt start up until half way through the book.It was complicated and a bit heavy to take in but all  in all, a great book I recommend.
0525478817|4.0|I was so excited to read this novel after all of the hoopla that surrounded its release.  It did not take me long to become engrossed in the story.  It is a novel that is full of humor and humanity.  I'm not one that cries easily when I read or watch movies, but The Fault in Our Stars managed to draw a few tears.  John Green is a fantastic author.  The only complaint I have were a few style things that bother me, but they are all a personal preference thing and I don't want to say what they are because I don't want anyone that reads this to notice the quirks more than they would have on their own.
B0071QIN00|5.0|i love it it is so addictive it is awesome cool an fun who ever made it thank you you rock peace out oh it ros k peace out again bye thank you
B000099T2L|1.0|You're in love with yourself. We're also aware of the fact that you are female. No need to invent new ways of proving it. Instead, go back into the studio and spend more time on your music and less time on your wardrobe.<br /><br />If you don't then in another five or so years, you will be an old, sad, cougar with something to prove just like Janet Jackson.
B0071QIN00|3.0|It's ok for being free, nothing special.  Were you aware that a monster such as I is capable of a sentence such as, &quot;I like turtles...&quot;
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a very good quality game and worthwhile downloading. There are quite a few ads but its easy to navigate around them. What do you expect for a free app?! So addictive for those who have some spare time and want to play a light yet visually stimulating game.
B0071QIN00|5.0|i got this app for the kindle fire and itz awesome. this game iz very fun and after a while might get boring but still fun.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is by far the best free app available! Im able to search for and listen to radio stations broadcasted in the UK. Any type of music you are interested in, there is a radio station that specifically plays it and this app will let you access them. While listed to music in the background you can perform other functions with the Kindle fire, like read, play games, search the internet. I am so glad I discovered this awesome app!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|if u when u get gems for outworks so win win and Briana and Ariel don't fail me its a big
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great games!!  Unique games.  Some easy, but some are rather difficult!  All are fun!!  Even if they want to make you pull your hair out!!!
B0071QIN00|5.0|Much cleaner than the original Trial Xtreme.  Excellent graphics, smooth controls, and challenging levels.  Runs great on the Kindle Fire.  Nice improvements by the developers....
B001IMFHTS|5.0|Before making your purchase, be sure you understand that this is a set of DVDs and not audio CDs.  The recordings will NOT play on a conventional CD player. If you have a pair of top level earphones and a computer with Windows Media Player or its equivalent, the DVD will provide excellent sound and give excellent camera views of a master conductor leading a great orchestra.  Whether or not Abbado's baton technique will mean much to non musicians is subject to discussion.  Conducting styles are highly idiosyncratic to begin with.  The real work of a conductor is done before rehearsals begin when detailed decisions are made which determine how the music sounds in performance.  Conductors who give the audience a gymnastics exhibition while conducting give me a pain.  Hans Vonk, for example, suffered a severe muscular illness late in his career.  I once watched him conduct sitting down with very little hand movement.  Despite his physical limitations, Vonk had prepared the orchestra well and the sound was great despite an absence of energetic baton swinging.  Considering these recordings purely as music, I find them to be pure Beethoven and Abbado, to my ears, is a master Beethoven conductor.  In that respect, he ranks with Reiner and Monteux.  The Eroica is particularly strong.  In the 5th, the transistion from the 3rd to the 4th movement rises to a dramatic climax and the symphony reaches its usual thrilling end.  On the downside, the choral movement of the 9th does not quite mesh despite the individual excellence of the soloists.  Perhaps I was spoiled years ago by Robert Shaw's  interpretation when he was conducting the Atlanta Symphony.  The 8th Symphony is not as quite as ebullient at Monteux's but it is not stodgy like some performances I have heard where the conductor did not do full justice to Beethoven's humor.  The 7th comes across with grace and power.  The last movement, for example, does not start too fast and never seems to be teetering out of control.  It seems to develop power and precision as it soars to a dramatic climax. It is at once a dance and an orchestral tour de force.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|Van Halen<br /><br />Fair Warning (1981)<br /><br />\\"Fair Warning\\", despite the fact that it failed to produce any big hits, is an excellent album.  Even the Disco song \\"Push comes to shove\\" cannot ruin it.  All the songs (with the exception of that inexplicable Disco addition) are hard rocking gems.<br /><br />The album cover comes from a painting by William Kurelek, called \\"The Maze\\" (in case you were wondering).  See the full painting in the `album pictures' on this page.<br /><br />This is a Five Star album.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Service and shipping were great.I saw the movie before and thought it was pretty go.Its based on a true story.dvd quality was great.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|One of the better free games on the market. Love that you can many different games on one app. Would defiantly recommemnd.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I decided to hop in and write a review about this good head pair, in sights that there is way too many 5 star reviews and that got me hooked into buying the headset. While there is a very good quality on the pair and software wise is fun and useful, there is two major drawbacks.<br />The batteries are not for meant for the hardcore gamers. Did I get too used to my old Sennheiser TR120? The later had an awful hissing sound and got worse as time passed by. It did however hold a charge for 1 full day of music, games and skype. The G930 just seem not to cut it, even though I try to let it charge the full night so its ready for another day of fun. I end up using the charger around the last 2-3 hrs of the day. I guess it would not bother me as much if it had a cradle to sit on while not on use in the day...but it doesn't.<br />The other disadvantage are random disconnects while I go through the kitchen. Is it the microwave? the fridge? It almost feel like its company'standard that designed them that way. \\"Let's have a good quality sound at all times or disconnect if not achievable\\"?<br />Buyer beware.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this DVD! When I started the program I thought I was going to pass out, but everyday became easier. I did all 30 days and I lost 10 pounds! 3.5 inches off my waist, 2 inches off my hips, .5 inches off my arms, 1 inch off my legs. You have to push through it. I never was able to do a \\"regular plank or push up\\" .... I did those on my knees and still saw great results. I am so happy I bought this video and highly recommend it. I am so excited to continue my journey to getting fit.... and this is a great start.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This Is a great app for kindle! you will love it!  Weather is very accurate. Please get this app!  if u don't like it. its free
B0054JZC6E|5.0|kkhhggbjguf hfhhudffcnbhbj hfzbf jjggsh jjbvfv hbghbjb hnheggb I did this for game points so plzz donnt really be mad I am like 15
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Great app for, troubleshooting wireless networks, signal strength and channel issues. Especially if there are a bunch of networks you don't have control of.
B005VPRETE|5.0|Let me start by saying I had reservations about having to \\"girlify\\" legos. I have used legos since I was a kid, my husband as well, and have an extensive set of the regular blocks. I dislike having to make everything in my life for either girls or boys. I give my daughter every opportunity to play with superheroes and cars and trucks and blocks too. That having been said, I think this type of set was created with girls play styles in mind-- girls tend to want to build stories while boys are more focused on the item itelf. It was amazing to watch my not-quite-five year old build the complicated structure herself, with just a little guidance and encouragement from me. We were using math skils, language skills and visual-spacial skills for the better part of an hour, and she couldn't wait to finish her tree house and play. Once assembled, she promptly grabbed her Playmobil pirate set and staged an attack and defense of the treehouse, lol. This sparked a good old family movie night watching \\"Swiss Family Robinson\\", with my daughter riveted by this whole magical world expanding from what she created with her own two hands. It was amazing, and we will definitely be getting more of this set! If anything, I would love to see Lego create more unisex characters in this style. The character style really is more fun (and the blocks work perfectly into the old lego sets. I found it durable, and well-made for a structure that is made by a child out of plastic blocks. My daughter played with it all evening (and so did my 20 month old son) and it held up :) Love this set!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|got thr upgrade it was soooooooooooooooooo. fun lille fish not going to tell much get it it is free and fun
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|I watched this movie this morning and didn't quite know what to expect.  I like the actors and saw that Spielberg was associated with it so I thought I would give it a look.  Damn, this was good.  I would go as far as to say that I enjoyed this film as much as I enjoyed the Rocky movies -- and I love those.  The idea of robot boxing...whatever.  Spielberg making a movie about robot boxing and i was still thinking, yeah whatever.  Then I watched it.  Robot boxing is freaking cool!  The cast was great, the story was very human, and overall it was really good.  I'm not going to say that it's great, but as i stated in my title, it was surprisingly good.  Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of REALSTEEL today.  [[ASIN:B002M9WW30 Rocky: The Undisputed Collection (Rocky / Rocky II / Rocky III / Rocky IV / Rocky V / Rocky Balboa) [Blu-ray]]].
B0068TL23G|5.0|I love this game it starts out easy and then gets very challenging.  I am currently stuck on chapter 7 stage 12 are there any cheat sheets out there? I have used the star points to show me the 1st &amp; 2nd path and feel like I have tried every possible solution!?!?
B006UG90RM|4.0|I heard that these are reworkings of unreleased tracks from the 1980s.  Well so what if they are?  Tattoo sounds like it could have been off 1984.  I think it would have fit in perfectly.  There's no doubt that it is awesome to hear new music from DLR and VH.  If you don't think about it, you would think that this is the classic lineup.  Wolfgang fits into Mike's shoes just fine.  That is as far as playing base.  Due to the fact that you don't get Mike's bg vox which added a lot to their music, that is enough to take a point away from this release.  Eddie is in top form with his playing and soloing.  Check out his solo on Blood and Fire -- awesome.  This whole record sounds like its been in a vault somewhere like it was the original follow up to 1984 that got shelved b/c of the infighting between Dave and Eddie at the time.  I'll admit this -- it doesn't matter to me who is taking over lead vox.  This band is about Eddie and Alex.  Period.  Now here's a thought -- what would VH sound like if they dumped all their lead vocalists and recorded an album without lyrics?  I think it would be totally cool.<br />[[ASIN:B001O7SMLC 1984]]<br />[[ASIN:B00004Y6O7 Fair Warning]]<br />[[ASIN:B00004Y6O9 Van Halen]]
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good but could be better smiles smiley smile ma la la la la kitties and rainbows 4 out of 5 stars and I love you
B0071QIN00|4.0|Great story Superman75, you always make me smile and lol. Now on to the app - I don't usually get these kinds of games, and the graphics were a little off-putting, but it was free so I decided to try something new. I'm not sure if I'll keep it installed, but it was fun to mess around with and challenging at times if you're not used to those kinds of games. Overall, I thought it was done well and it ran great on the Kindle Fire.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|I saw this after I read (and loved) the book.  It was very well acted and nothing in the movie conflicted with the book, but the movie was simply not able to go into the detail that the book had, even with a run time of 2 1/2 hours.  Some characters were missing entirely, and the relationships between those who remained were not shown with the same depth.  Considering that the story is largely about relationships and interactions with others, this was a big disappointment to me.  That said, it was still a better-than-average film, with good actors, a good story, and excellent costumes and settings that really transport you to the time and place.
0545265355|5.0|I purchased The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxed set after I had read the first book, The Hunger Games. It was a riveting book and the second and third books didn't let me down either. They were exciting and heart wrenching and kept me engaged the entire time. The realness and relatability of the characters are what will make the Hunger Games Trilogy classics! I am so glad I got the hard back set so that I can pass them down to my daughter to read. I proudly display them next to my other sets of epic stories like The Lord Of The Rings and The Chronicles of Narnia. This is the perfect gift and keepsake!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are fun and will take a while to finish. over all I would recommend it to everyone.  my son will really like them.
B000AQJPQE|3.0|We got this for my daughter for Christmas. She was so thrilled about it and had a blast putting the planets in order with us. She used it nightly for a few days, but then it just wouldn't turn on. We thought maybe she used it too much and the batteries ran down (though we were a little annoyed that the batteries only lasted a few days). After changing both the batteries in the system and the remote, it still won't work. We have no idea why and she is devastated. We will replace it with the same system, only since there aren't similar ones, but we're going to just cross our fingers this one isn't a dud too.
B0071QIN00|5.0|I love this app!!! funniest part is when I make myself crash and get a concussion! :D  you should definetely download this downtrend miss out and miss the best faotd Evar!!!!!!!
B0067QPVJ6|2.0|I really enjoyed this movie. However, there are plenty of reviews on the film itself. After ordering the dvd, I was very excited when I received word that it shipped. But, it wouldn't play in my Blue-ray player. I sent it back and got a replacement but it would not play either. My neighbor also tried on his Blue-ray to the same end. Previews play, Anti-piracy warning and then it freezes. I guess the Universal has finally come up with a way to insure that customers buy the blue-ray combo pack in order to watch in higher definition. A really crappy thing to do.
B0071QIN00|5.0|All the bad reviews are from people with no idea what this game is trying to do or immitate and it is disappointing to see no one remembers this classic style. Its no TrialsHD but its a great attempt at the subgenre for the mobile market! Runs great on kindle fire, just use buttons. When you bought a two hundred dollar tablet you might have realized its tilt hardware is subpar but instead you ruin a companies rating on a great FAotD?
B006UG90RM|5.0|This is the long awaited album from Roth and Ed et al, almost all the tracks are fast (like circa VH II) and it does not mean a bad thing, Ed nailed it again, and again. No wonder he plays better with Roth on vocals, so much pride between them at stake maybe? Well, I am not doing the review track by track, it will just get boring, the reason I submitted this review is to call for arms.  Buy the album, it is neck to neck in achieving the top spot this coming week at Billboard 200.  Just to share, sadly, I was among the first clients who visited JB Hi-Fi nearby and struggled to find the CD, asked a crew, she found one, asked for the CD/DVD edition, she had to go to computer and check and found that there is, she said, \\"Wait here, I will get you one\\", My response\\" Don't get one, get three for me and get many for the front of the store where the new releases are promoted, this is an Amazon.com #3 on sales chart and many people will certainly look for it. She promised to tell her Store Manager about my suggestion, you know what happened, I went back to store daily and up to now, after almost the whole week, the CD is still not displayed at the front, only rubbish bands that are talent less. At first glance, it seems their loss, but even though, if Van halen's A Different Kind Of Truth does not hit Billboard #1 spot this week, that store is partly to be blamed. They just don't listen to what is a good sales move for them, hurting a great band along the way. So if you go to a music store, and does not find the album at once, ASK! Hopefully they have a \\"Got Talent\\" section at the back of the store.  Again, buy the CD, support the might Van Halen!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game ecspecelly finding the golden eggs and the bomb bird! I also liked getting 3 stars on every level.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very fun game, works very well,  I haven't had any problems with pop ups or spam either. Highly recommend, this a great game!
B001FB4W0W|2.0|This would definitly qualify for a NC17 rating. It was too graphic for my taste and I will not be continuing with the series. Now I just have to get rid of this one.
B00762ZPOQ|5.0|It is a wonderful episode and series. I can't wait to see what comes in the next episodes. WIll Mary and Mathew ever get together?
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Lots of hidden objects in each puzzle.  Some are very obvious, others are more.challenging.  Not a bad game for a rainy day.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This app has great graphics, sound... The app's levels are tricky so that they are at my personal level. This app is totally cool, and totally worth my dollar. I recommend this app for any angry birds fan.  First off, the graphics are perfect. The cool new birds, blue and Jewl, are very fun and entertaining!  They have a spectacular new power, each of them do, and they are drawn just like they are in the movie. The graphics of the birds are amazing, better than they were in angry birds seasons and better than they were in angry birds seasons and angry birds original version. I recommend this.  The sound is catchy, and it motivates me while I am writing stories in my composition. The music is tropical and reminds me of Hawaii. It has the same tune as the theme of angry birds is. It is like theme and variation. Except, this variation is Hawaiian. The music can be bought in the music store of your kindle fire, but why get that for 0.99 when you can get the music AND the game for that amount. m  The &quot;golden eggs&quot; of angry birds Rio are really just &quot;golden fruits&quot;. The golden fruits are very hard to get, however. The golden fruits are hard to play because you have to get ALL of them in that section (you know, like ham em' high, poached eggs, the big setup) and just to advance to the levels that have them and hitting the boxes and packages that contain them is hard enough! This is why it is at my level of playing.  This is why I highly recommend this app to anyone who is a fan of angry birds Rio.  P.S. That's me!!! :) Not :p
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love YouVersion's Bible app. Easily accessible and easy to navigate. The plans are awesome for keeping me on track. A person can easily read chronologically or however is best for them to read and learn.
B000RMQH30|5.0|My favorite Ben Harper CD. Everytime I play it people ask \\"Who is that?\\" and make a note to buy it. I actually bought this one for a friend to prevent him from stealing mine!
140053271X|5.0|I tried to leave this review at barnesandnoble.com, but they never posted it. Oh well.  The Nook Simple Touch is a great e-reader. If you are looking for a tablet like device to surf the internet and check email, this is not the product for you. The e-ink screen is amazing. It looks like you are reading a physical book. I like that you can turn the page by pressing the buttons or touching the side of the screen. Either way will be useful depending on how you are holding the book. This is very simple, which I love. One night, I was lying down in bed and went to lay the Nook on it's side then immediately jerked it back up before the page orientation changed. Then I remembered that it won't do that; which makes this great for reading no matter what position you may be sitting or lying in.  The Nook accepts epub books; which means that you can get books from a variety of stores, not just Barnes & Noble. I found that between the B&N store and Google Books, you can get all of the classics for free. No reason to pay for one of those ever again. Download Adobe Digital Editions to put books on from other places; including borrowed books from the public library.  The Nook doesn't handle pdf's well on its own, but there is a work around. Download Calibre, bring your pdf's into it and then convert them into epubs. Once you do that, you will be able to highlight and take notes like you can with the actual books.  If you want a simple e-reader, the Nook Simple Touch is the best. (FYI: It's costs less on the B&N website.)
B000BDLJBU|5.0|This particular product, the Neutrik NTP3RC, is of fantastic quality.  Plugs just aren't designed and made this well, in my experience.  So these are unique.  I'm fascinated by their design and quality.  I'd have paid much more for them had I known.  Certainly made the shipping costs worthwhile.  (I bought 4, which also helped.)  I intend to use these to replace some existing headphone plugs for use with the Kindle Fire, because these will help relieve any inadvertent strains that might occur with a straight-line plug that is usually found with headphones.  They have excellent solder tabs, an excellent pair of plastic pieces used for strain relief (and one of which is designed well to also insulate the contacts from the metal shell externally.)  Do NOT buy these unless you know how to solder and have appropriate tools, though.  They are not extension plugs.  They are just very high quality replacement plugs that anyone with soldering skill and tools can apply.  I don't write many reviews.  Three maybe?  But these were just too good to believe.  So had to write something about them.
B0071QIN00|5.0|Nice graphics. Works great on an Acer A500 running Android 3.2.1.  There is a choice of tilt or button/touch control. Music & effects volume is either on or off, not adjustable through the game. Not a show stopper.  The big boobs trophy girl is a nice touch.
B001JNNE64|2.0|I know we're all addicted to the idea of Director's Cut is far better than theatrical cut, Amadeus is not one of those movies(Dances with Wolves is another disaster). It was truly a great movie as it was.  So please don't deprive us with this Director's Cut only!  Give us theatrical cut or at least give us both version release.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Considering how long it has been since Diamond Dave and Eddie made music together, this album is amazing.  Everytime I listen to it it gets better.  All is right in the world of music.  Boy I missed that guitar, not to mention the one and only David Lee Roth!
B006JPS1OM|4.0|I actually don't care for the types of games, but this one is better than many chiefly because of the crime theme.  I wish the locate the hidden object portion wasn't the focal point, but it was quite fun. The storyline is compelling enough although the mystery isn't that mysterious. But it will hold your attention
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great. I enjoy it for many reasons but the fact you can change translations with easy and jump to other books without going back to the table of contents are my favorite.  You can keep up with your Bible teacher and not miss a word. Its free so what's to lose if you try it out.
B0063IH60K|5.0|just like playing the game with real cards. I don't know why this game is free, it has minimal ads and is certainly worth paying for.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is great for any age! It's complexing some tomes but that's part of thet thrill! btw the monster. is so cute!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|my whole family loves this game.  it is challenging and so much fun!  it is hard to stop.playing.  I just cant get enough!!!
B005M2A4D4|5.0|Matt Smith has finally, for me, become the Doctor.  He is on track, full speed ahead, a Time Lord for the people!  This set is not just the Sixth Series but also A Christmas Carol, Confidentials, Commentaries, and so on.  But the meat and potatoes of the set is, of course, the Doctor Who episodes and MANY of them will go down in history, Doctor Who History, as some of the best episodes EVER.  Such as The Doctor's Wife, The Rebel Flesh, The Alomst People, and Night Terrors.  Even The Girl Who Waited, which has one of the most AMAZING plot twists in the whole series, will very likely be thought of as one of the Top Ten episodes of the New Doctors.  Well, not as good as The Doctor's Wife, but very damn close.  Some of them, such as The curse of the Black Spot and Let's Kill Hitler are pretty close to perfect. Maybe in the Top Hundred of the new Doctors.<br />But in some ways the theme is the same.  As in the last series the Doctor is the target.  But who is the weapon and who is sending it after him?  Yes, the weapon is a living being and one we ALREADY know.<br />And we get to see The Doctor and River Song marry!  Isn't that lovely?<br />Matt Smith does a great good, lots ot power behind his acting, and
0061726826|5.0|I finished this book today. It brought me to tears. It reminded me of the book The Giver (amazing book) and the book series Uglies (also amazing). Even The Hunger Games series is similar. Honestly I think that Delirium is the best of all these \\"Dystopian society\\" books. My heart currently is aching due to the heart breaking ending :( It's so sad! When I read books I put people in reality into the characters position and the thought of the person who represented Alex... it's terrifying. But it makes a great book. I cannot wait until February 28 (only 18 days away!) when Pandemonium comes out.  This is my favorite book and I hope that people read it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great way to pass the time, especially when you've been concentrating diligently on work-related tasks. Great mind release!
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|This focuses on what people often unconsciously do to one another and how destructive it can be.  Also described synchonicity and importance of following/paying attention to it.  The cinematography is negotiable but the theme and lessons are priceless!
0618680004|2.0|After reading innumerable reviews, I've got to add my own:<br /><br />If you can't dazzle 'em with brilliance, baffle 'em with ... let's call it bovine excrement!  (Amazon nixed my review when the other phrase was used!)  And in such a style writeth Dr. Dawkins.  Here's \\"The God Delusion\\" in a nutshell; for clarity, I'll enumerate his major points.<br /><br />1)  Religious people are stupid, for they believe in their Scriptures rather than in Science.<br /><br />2)  Theology isn't even a proper field of study.  This is clear because its net contribution to society has been zero, or even less.  Why?  Because I said so!  Gee, I proclaimed it unintelligible; isn't that enough?<br /><br />3)  Why should we even respect religious ideas?<br /><br />4)  Religious people, especially religious political regimes, have perpetrated innumerable evils in the name of God.<br /><br />5)  Atheists NEVER would never stoop to such levels.  Any evil they do must be traceable to religious roots or some other such thing.  Ergo, since I, the omniscient Dawkins, have never seen Hitler's formal renunciation of Catholicism, it's likely he was acting as a good Catholic when he gassed all those Jews.<br /><br />6)  Most of the political problems in the world would disappear if we would just eradicate religion.<br /><br />Okay, that's a good overview of Dawkinsian politics.  Ready for the scientific/philosophical part?<br /><br />1)  The only stuff of the universe is physical.  So we need not consider the reality of something as inconvenient as Spirit.<br /><br />2)  Anything that gives richness to life flows from incredibly complex material interactions.<br /><br />3)  God must be material, otherwise he's not real.  But I can't find him, and neither has anyone else! Ergo, God existeth not.<br /><br />4)  All the proofs for God's existence are moronic.<br /><br />5)  God most probably doesn't exist, because Darwinian Natural Selection does not require him and (let us bow in reverence) is a better explanation that doesn't suffer from the problem of Infinite Regress like a Designer God so very obviously does.  Those Intelligent Design guys sure are funny dolts, aren't they?<br /><br />6)  By the way, don't bother me with silly \\"why\\" questions, like \\"why do we exist at all rather than not exist?\\"<br /><br />Easy, isn't it?  Next up, morals!  This is slightly stickier, so let's all pay attention to the good teacher!<br /><br />1)  All people have approximately the same moral values.<br /><br />2)  Therefore, religion is emphatically NOT the source of morals.<br /><br />3)  The Bible isn't either - just look at all the bad examples of morality there!  The God of the Old Testament is about the most hateful, mysoginistic, brutal monster ... but wait, that line is so often-quoted from my book; no need to repeat it here.  Obviously, the Bible is a \\"how-to\\" handbook of morality, so it fails miserably.<br /><br />4)  Therefore, we need to allow the much kinder atheists to be the guardians of public morals.<br /><br />5)  Religious indoctrination is obviously a form of child abuse.<br /><br />6)  Ergo, let's take children away from their abusive parents who insist on warping their children's minds with indoctrination!<br /><br />7)  Gee, why do religious folk so often accuse us atheists of being amoral?<br /><br />Written with tongue firmly in cheek, I can't really see that I've actually misrepresented Dawkins' views.  Many other believers besides myself, and maybe even a smattering or more of unbelievers might actually have some rather different questions for the New Atheist spokesman:<br /><br />1)  Hey, Richie, you tell us how Natural Selection is the best explanation for about everything.  OK, so it's great and all, but I'm no scientist, and I really don't get off on Darwin.  More important to me is pretty ordinary stuff like choosing a spouse or a career.  I know I'm a complete chump, but I can't see how evolutionary theory ever impacts my everyday life in eventhe slightest way - or am I missing something?  How does Natural Selection shed any light on those things?  If you say N.S. ain't the intellectual be-all and end-all, you've just opened up Pandora's Box.  Be careful - God just might come out!<br /><br />2)  How the heck can you Science Guys be all into Sci-Fi and fail to recognize that a lot of that stuff strongly resembles something bordering on the spiritual - at the very least, stuff like wormholes or time warps hardly seem solidly physical.<br /><br />3)  Oh, and Dr. Dawkins, I'm constantly tempted to refer to you with a popular contraction of your first name with all the gutter-level connotations that carries.  Why do you write in a way to inspire such a response?  Don't you realize that science often requires the support of the public to flourish - why anger 'em en masse?  Does civility and respect really hurt so much in the face of our quaint plebeian religiosity that you can't muster the strength or courage to try it even once?  Are you so insecure that you must constantly lash out?<br /><br />4)  What world are you from?  On planet Earth most of us can expertly foist evil upon one another - with minimal effort regardless of our religion or lack thereof!  And if we're in political positions we just claim we're performing the duties of our jobs!!  Isn't that nuts?  I think it'd be absolutely cool to live on a planet where all I need to do to avoid the worst evils is to quit believing in my silly God!<br /><br />5)  By the way, what is wrong with a \\"why\\" question?  How do you defend your commitment to materialism?  I know these are irritating little philosophical details, but since they're also axiomatic some of us can get pretty picky about knowing.  Your refusal to answer that kind of thing throws the shadow of a rather large doubt on your intellectual honesty.  But I know, those are hard questions, so it's more convenient to treat them with mockery instead.<br /><br />6)  Sorry - another little philosophical question.  I would REALLY appreciate knowing why I can't put Natural Selection in the mind of a Designer God .... just asking; no need to get defensive!<br /><br />Anyway, the Church of Darwin is just not big enough for me.  I'm sure I could go on, but that takes far too much work.  No sense in putting forth any more effort into a review than the author did into the book.  Actually, that's a lie - I do actually have another one written and ready, but it's over 4 times as long.<br /><br />Worth a read?  Yes: it's popular, it does make one think, it shows that mean atheists are really out there, and it underscores the terrible lack of critical thinking today that has reached almost epidemic proportions.<br /><br />Two stars.t!  2)  How the heck can you Science Guys be all into Sci-Fi and fail to recognize that a lot of that stuff strongly resembles something bordering on the spiritual - at the very least, stuff like wormholes or time warps hardly seem solidly physical.  3)  Oh, and Dr. Dawkins, I'm constantly tempted to refer to you with a popular contraction of your first name with all the gutter-level connotations that carries.

B000YAA68C|5.0|Again, I also purchased this for friend but watched a while back.  Very touching, moving, as weel as hysterical.  Perfect for women...and probably quite a few men.
0767802470|3.0|This is a WWII movie of a German U-boat (submarine) crew - so it is in German with subtitles.  [Though unlike many subtitled movies I've seen, this one is easy to read, and brief enough that it really doesn't distract from watching the movie.]<br /><br />The movie starts with the crew getting as drunk as possible the night before they ship out, some of them stand by the side of the road to the club and pee on cars as they pass. The next day they don't appear to be hung-over in the slightest and they eagerly start their tour of duty. They are packed in extremely tight quarters, with obvious hygiene issues and unsanitary conditions and flinging buggers and being crude (later you find out a good deal of them have crabs)...basically the movie is fairly easy to walk away from for the first 30-45 minutes, however if you make it that far you are rewarded as the action, tension, suspense and danger kick in and you feel it along with the crew as they go through multiple life and death situations that not everyone survives.  [40,000 were sent out on U-boats in WWII, 30,000 didn't make it back]<br /><br />The ending surprised me - but then I hadn't read the book or read any reviews etc.<br /><br />Very good filming - kudos to the person(s) behind the camera. [I appreciated this more after watching the interview about the making of the film and what they all went through) Not a movie I would choose to watch a second time<br /><br />If you know someone who served their country on a submarine, this movie will give you a much better appreciation of what they endured.  [Other movies I've seen - American - showed tight quarters on their subs but they seemed spacious and such compared to this so I think it's an interesting comparison.]<br /><br />NOTE:  Blockbuster has 2 disks for this movie, Disk 1 has full movie, Disk 2 has same full movie plus interview about making the movie.
B000683VI4|5.0|I bought for a friend bought watched years ago.  Powerful movie, showing often part of what authentic love is all about.....beyond the \\"chemistry\\" and excitement of a new relationship.  Check it out for sure if you havne't....you'll wonder why you havn't.
B0071QIN00|5.0|challenging and frustrating at times, but true to the console version. would like to see the brake reverse the bike like in the Xbox version, but the bike hop is pretty sweet. worth the money.
B0001WANCM|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies for years.  Focuses on importance of following your inner voice despite all that may encourage (usually unconsciously) you to do otherwise.  A must watch!

B002ZG980U|2.0|I wasn't impressed by the movie even though it is related to my profession.  However, MANY love this flick and I bought as a gift for a good friend who appreciates the file.  It was well done I must say, just \\"wasn't feelin' it.\\"
B0054JZC6E|3.0|you won't get addicted to any of the games but some you will enjoy, I finally fiqured out Suduka playing this. The only real problem with this is on the action games my Amazon Kindle Fire sucks at quick response and often need to clean the screen. Basically I plan on playing all the games, making the set scores and delete the whole thing after that.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Amazing action, story, etc.  Wouldn't recommend for children though...far too much hand/hand violence (not that any type is better).  There's also some good modeling as far as values in life.
0553801473|3.0|minor spoilers<br /><br />Less describing what people are eating and more advancing the story please!  Seriously, if you skip over the paragraphs devoted to what the characters are consuming at every meal this book is only about 500 pages long.  I've really enjoyed this series, but unless I know that the story will be concluded in the next volume or two I'm going to stop right here.  I would also like to know that the next volume or two will be coming out reasonably soon.  I'm not interested in waiting around for years only to read another 1,000 page volume that doesn't advance the story in any way.  I assumed the point of book 4 would be made clear in book 5, but that just makes two volumes of seemingly pointless character development.  If the story isn't going to go anywhere, could we at least get some battles or something?  Book 5 is full of people either hanging out in various castles or simply walking around.  Arya Stark has been sitting around in that temple for the last two volumes, Jaimi is still roaming around the riverlands not really doing anything, Danaerys is pretty much in Meereene the whole time getting no closer to Westeros, Tyrion finally makes it to Meereene and then has no impact on the story, neither queen in King's Landing has their story advanced in any appreciable way, Brienne and Sansa are hardly mentioned.  Mr. Martin, I would appreciate it if you would announce that this series will conclude at the end of volume 7.  I would also appreciate it if you would announce that the next volume will be out this year and the final volume the next.  I could deal with that, but no more.
B0058A119G|4.0|I like Barbra Streisand a lot and buy each album she puts out.  I consider this one to be one of the best she's made in the last 10 years.  I was familiar with most of the songs but she does a great job with all of them.  My favorite track is Something New in My Life.  She's recorded many of the Bergman's most famous songs over the course of her career so some of these may be less familiar to some people.  I've seen some reviews which criticize her voice, saying it's not like it used to be.  People have to realize your voice changes as you get older, it's a fact of life.  Show me another artist in their late sixties who sounds as good as Streisand. If you're a Streisand fan I highly recommend this album.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is a fun app - easy to set up &amp; play with diff options. would've given 5 stars if it had more solitaire games.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|In a creative and beautiful way (how can it not be set in Paris) it's a poignant reminder of the importance in \\"living in the now.\\"  It becomes very tempting to dream of how we may have lived a happier life if we were only born sooner or later, but that time is much better spent making the life you have now happier.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|My 11 year old nephew loves knives. He carries a couple of them with him all the time, along with a multi-tool for fixing things. I bought this for him as a gift, so he can make sure the knives are always sharp. I have not used it, but looks nice, is compact for the pocket, and simple to use. Time will tell.
B00027JYLC|4.0|This has to be one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen, which is suprising considering how old it is...I felt bad for being creeped out by well-meaning kind hearted people who just happen to have been born with numerous physical deficiencies, but I can't help it...the pinhead people freak me out the most...like if they let them have normal hair and didnt make them wear NIGHTIES (even the men ones) theyd look far less 'freaky'. I wish I was a human duck.
B005UKJX4E|5.0|[[ASIN:B005HV6Y5W The Tree of Life (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)]]Terence Malick's films aren't for everyone, but if you can - please forgive the touchy-feely, hippie phraseology - just go with it, just let the visuals and music flow over and through you, this film is a revelation.  If you are a fan of Malick, or if you are willing to stop trying to analyze and interpret what you are seeing, if you're willing to look at what Malick shows you without trying to hold on to it - if you stop trying to make it into a secret code with some hidden meaning, this film can move you profoundly and deeply.  If you're just looking for a Brad Pitt family drama, or all you care about are trite and easily summarized and interpreted allegories and themes, this is not the film for you.  I'm usually more articulate, but this film defies rationalistic commentary, and the more you limit it to linguistic discourse the more you lose what the film is communicating, if that makes any sense at all.  I guess that's the point: this film makes no sense, because it rejects the very notion of \\"sense.\\"  Another way I might phrase this is that this film, like all of Malick's films, but to an even greater degree, is an attempt to directly convey emotional states without first translating those emotions into abstract formulations; it does this through a combination of sensory stimuli instead of commentary, dialogue, discourse, etc.  It's more akin to a haiku, or an abstract painting than representational art - which of course is the mode to which we are accustomed in film.  I think this provokes a highly negative reaction in many.  I'll stop now before I get completely weird.  If you hated the film, give it some time and thought - and I bet if you hated it the first time you saw it, you're still thinking about it, still seeing the images and hearing the voiceovers and music.  Give it another chance.  Often, we are exposed to art before we are ready for it, when we're unprepared, and upon returning to it have a far more positive experience.  I had a very similar experience with \\"The Last Temptation of Christ,\\" hating it vehemently when I first saw it, and upon being coerced into a second viewing completely reversed my opinion, and was embarrassed by the vitriol I had expended in condemning it.  So, if you hated \\"Tree of Life,\\" give it another watch.  Bottom line, turn off your cold rationalistic tendencies, and see this film with an open mind and open heart.  One last note: I wrote this review while browsing through instant videos, and noticed the film had a surprisingly low rating.  DO NOT EXPERIENCE THIS FILM THROUGH STREAMING.  Get the blu ray.  My review indicates that I'm reviewing the Instant Video, but I have not streamed it, nor would I.  I'm sure it's fine, but this film deserves to be seen with the best possible picture and sound.  I've put a link to the Blu Ray at the beginning of this review (you're welcome, Amazon); the transfer and remastering, both video and audio, are exquisite - a perfect Blu Ray.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some winners and some not so great, but overall a lot of fun choices and easy to figure out. Several very addictive choices.  Neat to open up one or two at a time.
0811879542|2.0|Well, a lot of other reviews are very positive so it must seem like a fresh idea, so I give it an extra star out of pure peer pressure, not the 1 star it felt like to me. This book just has the feel of a website meant for a toddler where they click or roll over an icon and something happens to it -- only it's supposed to be funny because it's a pretend click. But that one gimmick is all there is: the child is invited to do a pretend click or other action, and then they see a different image on the next page. There's no story, no illustrations other than dots.  Really, kids click enough buttons as it is and computers can do so much more using less trees -- the novelty of the concept wears off at page 2 or 3 and then there's the rest of the book still to flip through. My 4 year old was briefly amused by a couple of the pages, but it was a fast read and they haven't opened it again.  This is that book you flip through at the bookstore and are tempted by because you feel a \\"hah\\" novelty feeling, but that doesn't make it worth purchasing. If you're going to own (or buy as a gift) such an attractive thick feeling book why not an entertaining story, or artful illustrations to admire, or learn something about something.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|This is the most refreshing cd to come along in quite a while. After reading all the (unwarranted) hate about LDR on the internet I was unsure of what I might hear on my first listen-boy was I in for a pleasant surprise! I have not stopped listening since the first play-and the friends that we have told about the cd have all purchased it as well-and LOVE it!
B004LWZW42|5.0|Most superhero/adventure movies don't center on actual historic events; they tend to take place in a vague near-future or parallel present.  This fifth entry into the X-Men franchise breaks the rule, and very spectacularly.  I had been a bit dubious about a prequel without Patrick Stewart and the familiar younger Xers, but this one is just as good as any of its predecessors and better than some.  It's 1962, and Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), age 30, born in England but raised in his wealthy American stepfather's Westchester mansion, has recently earned his doctorate and been named a full professor at an English university, when he's approached by rookie CIA agent Moira McTaggart (Rose Byrne).  Moira has recently observed some incredible things, but what she doesn't know is that they portend the rise of mutants--the next stage in human evolution, speeded up considerably by the use of atomic power, most notably The Bomb--or that Xavier himself, besides being a genius, is also a mutant, a very powerful telepath.  After persuading the Powers That Be that mutants are real, Xavier is given the green light to assemble, under government auspices, a team of them to address the issue of the renegades who seem to be working for the Russians.  It takes everyone a while to realize that they're not working for the Russians at all (though even the Russians think they are): they're working for Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), who hopes to destroy ordinary humankind by starting World War III--he seems to believe that mutants will be able to survive fallout--and inaugurate an age of mutant supremacy.  Additionally Shaw is also a mutant--he can absorb any kind of energy and then release it under control of his will--and, under an alias, he worked as a scientist under Nazi auspices (though not a Nazi himself) in a concentration camp where a young Jew named Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) and his parents were imprisoned, and where he killed Erik's mother in an attempt to force Erik touse his own mutant power on command.  Now Erik's grown up and hunting him--and convinced, much as Shaw himself is, that mutants and normals can't possibly coexist; he fears anti-mutant pogroms on a scale not equaled since the Final Solution.  Shaw's plan is elegantly simple: manipulate the US and the USSR into planting missiles close enough to each other's territory that their DEW systems can't warn them of launches, then pressure one side or the other into making the first aggressive move.  The key to this program is Cuba and a ship loaded with Soviet missiles.  Of course the SFX in this movie are splendid, and the mutants themselves an intriguing and fascinating collection--Xavier's foster-sister-of-sorts Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), who can assume the shape of any person she wishes but in her own form has dark steel-blue skin patterned with tattoo-like ridges; Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult), later The Beast, a scientific genius working for the CIA who has thumbed feet and an athleticism that matches any ape's; Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones), who can scream at supersonic frequencies; Havok (Lukas Till), who can release red bolts of destructive energy; Angel (Zoe Kravitz), who has functioning dragonfly wings and can also spit gobs of fire; Emma Frost (January Jons), a powerful telepath who can also transform herself to a diamond-like entity; Azazel (Jason Flemyng), Shaw's good left hand, who (except for his lack of horns) looks rather like the popular conception of the Devil, tail and all, and is a teleport; Riptide (Alex Gonzalez), who can call up whirlwinds; Darwin (Edi Gathegi), who \\"adapts to survive\\" according to the environment or situation he's in.  (There's even a brief appearance by Wolverine, which those who have seen his movie [[ASIN:B004UPANAI X-Men Origins: Wolverine]] will understand completely.)  The extended climactic faceoff between the American and Soviet fleets over the Russian missile ship is non-stop suspense and excitement, with mutant power beingslung in every direction, shells and rockets flying, and a final tragedy that shapes the future of Xavier and his school-that-is-to-be--and of Erik, now known as Magneto.  But almost the best part is the relationship between the two men; Erik seems not to be an evil person at heart--he wants to be Xavier's \\"brother\\" but can't accept the concept of mutants and normals living side-by-side.  There's a good deal of sf violence, as might be expected, plus one instance of the f-word, some discreet nudity, and one sort-of-sex scene, so it's probably best suited to families with older kids; but it's sure to raise some important discussion points, besides being a superior entry into a popular series and a great action movie that ably stands on its own feet.

B004EPZ07K|4.0|This movie has gotten a fair amount of less-than-stellar press in various quarters, and it definitely has derivations from [[ASIN:B0006VIE4C Star Wars, Episode IV- A New Hope (Widescreen Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B000UU4NE4 Spider-Man 3]], but I found it a not despicable example of the popular superhero-adventure genre.  Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) is a test pilot for the Ferris aeronautical corporation and the son of a pilot who died before his eyes in a fiery explosion when Hal was just a boy (his two brothers think he wants to \\"be like him so bad, you need to die like him,\\" and certainly he does tend to take fantastic risks).  Following a hotdogging faceoff with a pair of drone fighters (his wing \\"man\\" is Carol Ferris (Blake Lively), daughter of the company's owner (Jay O. Sanders) and his girlfriend since they were kids), Hal is fired and suddenly finds himself scooped up by a ball of mysterious green energy which takes him to the dying Arin Sur (Temuerua Morrison), a member of the intergalactic police force known as the Green Lanterns.  Sur has crash-landed on earth after being attacked by a being called Parallax, a feeder on and embodiment of fear, who was once one of the Immortals who originated the Lantern corps; knowing he's doomed, he has ordered his ring, the source of his powers, to find him a replacement--and it's chosen Hal.  Hal himself isn't at all sure he's suited to the job, and neither is Sinestro (Mark Strong), a veteran Lantern who considers humans a young and primitive species.  But what neither Hal nor Sinestro knows is that the xenobiologist genius Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard), son of a powerful Senator (Tim Robbins) who's always considered him a disappointment, has been tapped to head up the analysis of Sur's body--and contaminated by a bit of Parallax's bioessence in the Lantern's fatal wound.  Hal tries to resign from the Lantern corps, but when he discovers that Parallax is threatening Earth, he knows he can't shirk his duty.  There's plenty of action and some fine SFX, but at the core of the film is the distinction between being without fear (which is what Sinestro believes Lanterns must be) and overcoming fear (which, Hal realizes, is the key to success as a Lantern and otherwise).
B000T0XEGS|5.0|First seen by me on Sky Arts. Fabulous film set and cast.  Teresa Stratus is the perfect Violetta and a young Placido Domingo a wonderful Alfredo. Unfortunately, Customs and Royal Mail Handling charges added £11.82 to the delivery, which I hope to recover, as the DVD was just under the £15 limit, so an expensive purchase.  Be careful of extra charges.

B006PZBR8S|5.0|Most of you have probably seen, or at least heard of, Hugh Jackman's new movie Real Steel.  Now, in general I'm not a big fan of sports movies.  However, this is one movie that does a great job across the board.  The special effects are great, the story is both moving and powerful, and the action is satisfying.  I was especially impressed with the development of Jackman's character.  Written by John Gatins and directed by Shawn Levy, this is one movie that is worth seeing, even if you don't like boxing or robots.  Overall: 9.0/10  Overall this is an odd premise.  A sports movie about robots that box, an overwhelming champion vs. an unlikely challenger.  On the surface the entire movie feels like a bad remake of Rocky.  This feeling seems challenging to move past, but the movie itself provides all of the help that most people will need.  Between the reckless arrogance of Jackman's character, Charlie; the patient affection of Bailey; and the cleverness of Max will make most people fall in love with this movie.  While boxing robots might get some people into the theater, and might drive others away, they quickly become background details to the movie itself.  Writing and Production: 10/10  The writing in Real Steel is marvelous.  Gatins does a great job of keeping the focus on the characters, and not allowing the fantasy of the story to take over (something that happens all too often).  Characters and Acting: 9.5/10  Ever major actor in this movie pulled off their roles masterfully.  In fact, the only actors that weren't entirely convincing were Olga Fonda and Karl Yune, and even these I think were mostly because of the very limited screen time allowed to each.  The three main characters, Charlie, Bailey, and Max, are all very well developed, and entirely believable.  The growth of the relationship between Charlie and Max is the central feature of this movie, and it is masterfully written and acted.  World: 9.0/10  The hardest part of this movie to accept is the wholeconcept of robot boxing.  However, even this is explained fairly well.  The world has a lot of detail, although some of that detail could be better explained, or more believably presented.  Plot and Content: 10/10  I will promise you that you've seen this plot before.  Deadbeat dad comes back into his son's life, bonding through sports, and the underdog faces the champion.  None of the premises in this movie are new, none of them are incredibly original, none of them are groundbreaking.  However, they are put together with such skill, and performed with such masterful talent, that something that should be old hat becomes new and interesting.  This is not a movie that tries to be original, this is a movie that makes cliches real - something much more difficult to do.  Pacing: 9.5/10  Real Steel is an evenly paced movie.  It is not fast or slow, and it doesn't have a great variance in it's pacing.  Commentary: 8/10  Real Steel has one, overwhelming commentative focus: the importance of the relationship between father and son.  This focus is well-written, well-developed, and will bring tears to most peoples eyes.  All in all, this is a strong movie.  Conclusion:  Real Steel is one of those few movies that everyone is probably going to like.  It's well done, knows what it's trying to be, and doesn't try to make everyone happy.  This is a movie that sees has clearly set out goals and pursues them without question.
B005HWAOCA|5.0|The Cream: Live at Royal Albert Hall 2005 [Blu-Ray] is marvolous. The sessions were selected from different nights, with some duplicates from different nights. They are as good as anything Cream recorded in the 60s, although, perhaps not as flashy. The members have matured, and are now capable of completing a coherent, well-paced concert without going off on wild tangents to Never Never Land. They gave it their all!! Recording both audio and video with Blu-Ray technology captured every nuance. I already owned a DVD, and decided to order the Blu-Ray version when I got a flat-screen tv and Blu-Ray player. It knocked my socks off. Just make sure your subwoofer is in good shape.[[ASIN:B005HWAOCA Cream: Live at the Royal Albert Hall 2005 [Blu-ray]]]

B005Y4241K|4.0|On her live set, [[ASIN:B005Y4241K Adele Live At The Royal Albert Hall (DVD/CD Edited Version)]], Adele, one of the most recognizable voices of 2011 specifically, delivers brilliant live renditions of her hits from 2008's debut [[ASIN:B0018QOIXU Adele 19]] and 2011's follow-up, [[ASIN:B004EBT5CU 21]]. On the exceptional set, Adele proves that she's more than a `studio' vocalist, lending her powerful pipes to this fine compilation recorded in 2011.  While most of the arrangements maintain their `sanctity' in accordance with their studio counterparts, the effects are not boring, but rather just a solid, live version. There are few quibbles making Live a solid addition to any hardcore Adele fan's library.<br /><br />\\"Hometown Glory\\" opens the effort with a few changes, namely a mysterious ostinato to open the cut.  The dramatic use of the lower register of the piano is a nice touch and finally the cut settles into the piano-driven hit from 19.  The pitch by Adele is nearly perfect and proves to be a solid way to open the set. \\"I'll Be Waiting\\" follows, exhibiting top-notch mixing given the live-sound.  The supporting background vocals on the refrain sound particularly strong here. \\"Don't You Remember\\" keeps up the momentum, doing a fine job of preserving the original arrangement.  Adele's vocal performance is solid and dramatic by all means with no qualms to speak of.<br /><br />\\"Turning Tables\\" begins ever so slightly slower than the studio recording, but still preserves most of the nuances and vocal affections of the original.  The original does eclipse this live take, but \\"Turning Tables\\" sounds very solid live. \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\" is a better performance, with highly assertive lead vocals by Adele.  The producers have done a fabulous job of ensuring that Adele's lead vocals are highly present within the mix.  The grit achieved is marvelous to say the least.  \\"If It Hadn't Been For Love\\" is a nice cover performance, adding something different for listeners.  \\"My Same\\" is captivating as well, with Adele doing a fantastic job of presenting the jazz idiom.<br /><br />\\"Take It All\\" preserves the original performance, though the background vocals absence are a slight quibble; they would've taken \\"Take It All\\" live over the top. \\"Rumour Has It\\" is well executed as far as maintaining the arrangement and personnel.  \\"Right As Rain\\" does a fine job of preserving the arrangement and breaking up lengthier songs.  \\"One and Only\\" is perfect, achieving a sound mix and pure, capable vocals by Adele.  As great as the interpretation of \\"One and Only\\" is, adding some horns would've made the cut truly cutting edge and `killer.'  If there was one other quibble musically, it might be that at the end the background vocals from the choir fade out - an issue that also occurred with the original. Imagine the added power with retaining the choral vocals.  Regardless, \\"One and Only\\" is a brilliant performance.<br /><br />\\"Lovesong\\" is fine, proving no more or less exciting than the studio version.  The only quibble might be that \\"One and Only\\" and \\"Lovesong\\" could have been spaced out considering their consummate length, however, they fall the same way on 21. \\"Chasing Pavements\\"  is solid, though a slightly less refined performance than the studio version.  \\"I Can't Make You Love Me\\" is a superb performance and perfect choice of song for Adele to cover.  \\"Make You Feel My Love\\" is also a solid Bob Dylan cover, keeping the momentum of the live set lofty.  \\"Someone Like You\\" and \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" close the effort particularly soundly, as expected.  \\"Someone Like You\\" is the better performance of the two, but \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" is none too shabby itself.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B005Y4241K Adele Live At The Royal Albert Hall (DVD/CD Edited Version)]] is a fine addition to any fan's library.  Adele sounds as powerful and recognizable as ever, proving to be more than just a studio singer - but did she really have to prove that? Highly recommendedlive set.
1567184855|2.0|Don't get me wrong I read the whole book. However it was a struggle. The metaphor of watching earth on a video before we get here to pick who will be our \\"host\\" body was disconcerting to me and it certainly did not ring true with my spirit. I do not feel that our spirits are using our human bodies in a partner in a parasitic relationship.
0061801313|2.0|Let me start by saying I'm an avid watcher of the show so I thought I'd give the books a try.<br />I'm also a college aged English major who still does love children/teen/young adult literature.<br /><br />However, I had a few problems with this book. Stylistically, I feel like the intended reading range should be 10-15ish. Yet, the topics and use of profanities make this a novel more for the 16-20 range. It is definitely a lower reading level, and the few chapters I read seemed to focus on vain, shallow aspects. The character development is very materialistically and appearance based. Syntax was quite bland and wordy, which didn't allow me to flow and stay smoothly in the story.<br /><br />Overall, the 3 Chapters that I read were just not my cup of tea.  The best advice I can give, is if you are a parent considering these for your daughter or son, you might want to look closer into the content first. Also before you buy, consider reading an online preview to really see if this is what you think it is.

B004BLDD9Y|5.0|This lamp is my first LED lamp purchase, as I slowly replace CFL's in my home. The lamp's quality of light is very natural, with only a very slight green tint. I noticed this tint only testing this lamp next to an incandescent lamp; it's something I scarcely notice, otherwise.  The LED lamp's silhouette is similar to an incandescent lamp, so it easily fits into lamp sockets that previously prevented me from using CFL's with their bulky bases.  Turns on instantly. Wastes very little energy as heat. I love them.
B006UG90RM|5.0|VH is back! While I hadn't exactly missed them figuring the glory days were long gone, this is a pleasant surprise.  This is definitely a return to the form of the first 4 albums.  (Thankfully not a return to the synths of the 1984 era!) This fits in nicely with the material from the 3rd and 4th album.  The playing by Eddie and ALex is inspired and the Chemistry with DLR makes the album for me. The album rocks hard, has a lot of energy and intensity.  The songs are well done and DLR sounds as good as ever.  Reading some of the negative reviews of the album bashing the vocals, the songs, the lyrics, I just don't get it if you've truly listened to the album and are truly a fan of the first 4 albums.  (If you think Diver Down and 1984 were VH's DLR era peak then maybe thats why) Let's face it, you don't go to one of the first 6 Van Halen albums if you are looking for deep meaning.  I therefore don't understand, the issue with the lyrics.  How can someone judge the lyrics as sub standard?  Have you ever read the lyrics to Everybody Wants Some or even Jump?  Not exactly deep!  But thats not the point with this album.  It's just a great rock record with great rocking songs and its nice to have a new album.  If you thought that the Hagar era was the superior version of VH then I can probably see that this will probably not be your cup of tea.  As not a big fan of the albums from that period, this is a welcome return to form. The album just rocks harder plain and simple than anything in that era! Highly recommended!

B001TOD92C|5.0|Mickey O'Rourke plays this one to a tee. Besides the thrilling wrestling presentation, there are some very affectionate scenes, especially with his portrayed daughter. The movie proves what some athletes go through. Once the adrenaline instills itself in their acting, they can't abandon it at the risk of losing someone very dear to them. Obviously, it's not only the money that matters to them, but also the fame and excitement of their sport.

076531178X|2.0|I went into Mistrborn expecting something engaging--not in an intellectual sense, really, but something fun, something that might tug on my heartstrings a bit.  Nothing complex and over the top.  I'd read two of Sanderson's short stories before this, and they were really exciting and fun, albeit not too original.  I was thoroughly disappointed with how this book turned out.  It has action, yes, and there's some fun here and there, but Sanderson handled the characters poorly, and the plot didn't build up very well.  The book is separated into several sub sections (like part 1, part 2, etc) each one with its own arc that moves the cast closer to the overall goal of overthrowing the evil emperor guy.  At the end of each section there's an action scene that's supposed to be big an momentous--one that will really bring the plot in a new direction.  However, none of those battle scenes felt dramatic or interesting.  Sanderson spends most of the sections showing the protagonist, Vin, attending balls and learning rumors, learning to be a lady, and moving along her character arc.  Then, at the end of the sections:  \\"HEY GUYS GUESS WHAT?  HERE'S AN ACTION SCENE!  TURNS OUT IT'S IMPORTANT!\\"  He didn't make us feel the importance or the tension.  It felt like action for the sake of action.  The larger arc of the book has this feel as well.  The climactic fight sequence just kind of... happens.  The characters are also poorly handled, for the most part.  Kelsier was interesting, and it seemed like he had some depth to him, but nothing all that interesting ends up coming of him.  The same goes for Vin--kinda.  She's kinda distant and she doesn't trust people all that well, and she has her little ups and downs: sometimes she trusts people, sometimes she doesn't.  What really ruins it for her is the fact that Sanderson has no clue how to employ subtlety.  He just tells you everything, shoves it in your face, and now the character doesn't feel human anymore.  There were perhaps twoscenes that held emotional depth.  They were very brief, and Sanderson probably had no clue that there was even any emotional tension in them because they were subtle.  The rest of the cast doesn't have much heart, either, except Elend, but he's too cliche and flat to really be enjoyed.  What irked me the most was the atmosphere of the book.  Seems like a trivial thing to talk about, but in a fantasy novel, atmosphere plays a huge role.  What would Lord of the Rings be without it's epic atmosphere?  What would A Song of Ice and Fire be without it's gritty atmosphere?  In Mistborn, Sanderson tries to create a gritty atmosphere, and he fails miserably.  He conjures these interesting images: ash falling from the sky, this dark, dreary city with oppressed peoples crowding the streets; thief gangs run rampant, and these dudes called Steel Inquisitors have NAILS HAMMERED THROUGH THEIR EYES.  They just walk around like that--nails in there eyes!  Sounds hardcore, right?  Wrong.  While all of this sounds like it might be gritty and really visceral, Sanderson interacts with this world like a novice fantasy writer interacting with their knock-off Middle-Earth.  The characters are too homely and kind, and action scenes are bloodless and read like bad anime translated to text.  This is a book about thieves, but no one's cut throat, no one's harsh and bloodthirsty and greedy--except for one guy, but he's only in two chapters or so, and it's apparent that Sanderson views him as a \\"bad guy\\".  Sanderson is too stuck in the amateur fantasy writer's mindset--good guys are nice, humble, pious, and pretty; bad guys are all racists (or some variation of that), egotistical, mean, ugly, and they--gasp--do the naughty!  So really, all this grit and grey is just a part of the setting.  In actuality, this is every Tolkien knock-off ever written.  Oh, but wait, it has hard magic.  That must mean it's original.  Sanderson did create a fairly interesting magic system, yes, but it's a bit too hard for my taste.  Really, this isn't a technical issue; I just don't like having to deal with countless rules.  It hampers the action sequences and turns some scenes into lengthy exposition-ridden monologues with the occasional question thrown in (always from Vin).  All in all, this really isn't a very good book.  Like I said, no subtlety, poor handling of the plot, no tension, cartoony, and, something I didn't mention before, lots of purple prose.  It gets two stars for being entertaining in a few spots, and for being consistent, if not very interesting, with the emotional story.  It's also hard to hate Kelsier.
B003Y5HWK4|5.0|I wouldn't say I like this show quite as well as say [[ASIN:B002OID4VS The Sopranos: The Complete Series]], but at the same time I really do like it!  I haven't even finished watching season 1 yet...I've got maybe 2 discs left, but I've watched enough to know I like it and I have been pretty enthralled in it.  Good cast and story and everything.  If you like good crime drama, then friends...this is a show for you!
0545425115|3.0|What Harry Potter did to Tolkien and what Twilight did to Stoker, The Hunger Games does to post-apocalyptic science fiction. That is, treat it as a setting for adolescent romance with pedestrian and formulaic prose. All that said, it IS a decent children's book.  It's not a terrible book; I'm not saying that.  But it IS being lauded well beyond its station.
B00631VJLE|5.0|My wife and I both really like Lacuna Coil, so of course when this new offering by them came out, we had to snag it.  We had heard a few songs off of it before it's release and loved them, so I went out on the day of release and picked up the CD/DVD version of it for us, which came with some cool stuff...a guitar pick, a poster, and a sticker.  We have not yet watched the DVD, but I'm sure there is some cool content on it.  We sat and listened through the whole album that afternoon while we ate lunch and were blown away.  Amazing album all the way through...probably their best album yet in our opinion!  We have listened to it multiple times and just simply love it!  If you're a rock/metal fan, I highly recommend checking these guys out...at least this album if nothing more.  Great stuff!

B00280LYIC|4.0|I decided to just read a few chapters to see if I could get into the book. I hadn't watched the movie when it came out so I knew precious little about the series. I realized that the book was a fast read when I was 50% of the way through it after an hour. I hadn't planned to read that much!<br /><br />I love the concept of this series and think it's been well-executed. Trouble manages to find Percy and through sheer dumb luck (and good friends) he manages to find his way out.<br /><br />Grover makes me think of the character Snot from American Dad. I can't help it. I adore the character. He's the lovable side-kick that provides you with the warm fuzzies.<br /><br />I liked that Percy wasn't flawless. He did dumb things and made mistakes. He floundered and fumbled but he grew and learned from his mistakes. He started to see both sides of the coin as the book went on and didn't take things at face value as much.<br /><br />One thing I appreciated about Riordan's storytelling is that he didn't draw it out. Yes, it seems easy in some areas and too fast but unlike some authors he didn't make it go on endlessly. He had a point and he stuck to it. He put in the action necessary to get through the task at hand and then let it go. I like that.<br /><br />Needless to say, after finishing this one, I picked up Sea of Monsters and devoured it, but I'll review that in the appropriate spot!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. It is so awesome and I love to play it every day on my device! This is an awesome game!
B002MQYOFW|2.0|Hunger Games. It's everywhere in the media. I can't escape it on TV and I can't escape it on the best sellers lists on Amazon. I can't even escape it at work when people are reading it and asking me questions about it. I can't escape.<br /><br />I bought the book months back when Amazon had a sale on the trilogy for $5. I bought it, I read the first two chapters and set it down. At that point, I was confused. Why did people like this book? How utterly depressing this world seems to be. After a bit of research and constantly asking people why they liked it, I came to think of it something like Twilight. People read it because someone said to, they felt they were supposed to like it and so they did. But, very rarely can anyone say WHY they liked it.<br /><br />A common response I get is \\"strong lead female\\" and OK, that makes sense. It's a YA novel, we need that for our girls to grow up and become strong leaders of their own. She's self-sufficient, that's certain, and she's determined. She capitalizes on skills she learned from her father and friend and helps her family to survive through the years. She then uses those skills in the game to survive there.<br /><br />As I type this, I keep thinking of the prophecy from Harry Potter which says, \\"Neither can live while the other survives.\\" I never feel like she's doing more than survive, she's not thriving, living or even growing. She's just hanging on for dear life.<br /><br />Now, granted, I'm not sure I'd be able to get through what she did but the viewpoint we see from the story has her time in the games as pretty easy and cushy. She's not truly struggling at all.<br /><br />I dunno, I just can't figure out why I wasn't impressed with her or this book. It wasn't bad, it was a fast read. I think because it was YA it flowed faster and only skated on the surface of \\"big ideas\\" but it was just .. meh.<br /><br />Having finished it, I now have to debate finishing the other two books. I imagine it'll be more of the same as the first and then of course we'll have drama drama drama from the love triangle. Oh joy.<br /><br />Katniss is in a unique position and I fear she won't get her head out of her ass long enough to do something about it. Yeah yeah yeah, she's young, she's been thrust into this role, etc etc... but really, if she's a strong female lead shouldn't she step up?rom the love triangle. Oh joy.  Katniss is in a unique position and I fear she won't get her head out of her ass long enough to do something about it. Yeah yeah yeah, she's young, she's been thrust into this role, etc etc... but really, if she's a strong female lead shouldn't she step up?
B0070Z4M4I|4.0|First,kudos to Amazon for offering this movie as a ppv download!..I have a Netflix account,and The Thing wasn't going to be available until Feb. 28.That wasn't going to do for a big fan of the originals,1951 and 1982.So for $3.99 I could watch it now,no excuses.  I didn't know until yesterday that Amazon even offered this service,pay per view online for current releases when they're available everywhere else,except for Netflix.Don't get me wrong,the Netflix service is a great deal if you have some patience for must see new releases,which I usually have,but not this time!  As for the movie,my expectations were very high or at least very hopeful,and I wasn't disappointed...For the most part...I wish they hadn't rushed things like they did at times.I prefer slower reveals,more suspense,but overall,they did a great job.The other problem throughout the whole movie was a very dark picture making it hard to see anything.This did nothing to add fear or suspense,it was more frustrating.Maybe when watching it on dvd at home the picture will be a little brighter.  This would be a great idea for the next 'Thing' or for a similar movie,there should be some thought provoking dialogue between the alien and the humans.A moment when everyone knows who is what,and there's a pause in the mayhem to find out what is motivating the alien imposter,the why,what and how behind its actions...It would have been very interesting to find out if the alien was just a homicidal maniac or since it's very intelligent there might be a method to the madness,a plan,a vision.  And even bolder idea then would be to let the alien bad guy win to see what that agenda is after reaching full fruition!..If the \\"thing\\" took over the world and won complete victory,how would the world change and how would the world be different...As humanoid things how would we be the same and how would we be different.  Such a movie would be extremely entertaining and thought provoking as well!..I suspect that eventually humanoid aliens would become just like we are today,only made out of different stuff,maybe better.  But I don't think movie makers have the guts to make such a movie where the aliens win,and we get to see what develops long term...Most movie makers don't have much original thought...Trust me Hollywood,let the aliens win sometimes,all the way,please.  [[ASIN:0792838416 Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]  I want to see a faithful sequel to the 1979 version of \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\",and see how the world and humanoids would change and remain the same,and then I want to how as humanoids we would evolve or devolve...My guess is over time we end up going full circle. After all humans are largely just the sum of their/our memories,and this alien creature not only absorbs and assimilates our bodies but also our brains and memories to not only pass for human but as the specific individual it's using as its host... After watching such a movie,people might better appreciate being what we are instead of just waxing negative about it.

0385535139|5.0|It was with a little trepidation that I downloaded the latest Grisham onto my Kindle.  His last couple of books had been disappointing, and I'd felt he'd lost his way and passion.  From the first paragraph Grisham had me hooked!  The Litigators was a gripping read in a slightly different way to his earlier bestsellers.  It was quirky, fun and had several laugh-out-loud moments.  Grisham has a sense of humour!  Three original, interesting and believable characters are developed warts and all.  They show you another side of street law and the lengths they go to to make some money just to cover day to day expenses.  Welcome back, Mr Grisham!  I loved this book!
B005I4JG80|5.0|Comparisons between cultures and countries are fascinating and informative. It shines a light on the commonalities, those features that as humans we share and are immutable, and the differences that are cultural only, though by ignorance we believe to be inevitable.  This is about at least middle class Parisian culture and child raising, with many hints that much of the philosophy and practice is much more part of French culture than merely Parisian. Two names stand out, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Francoise Dolto, the latter referred to as the French Dr Spock. My sense is that much of current child philosophy is based on Dolto who began her influence in the late 1960s. At this point, none of Dolto's works have been translated, so they're not available in English.  What I don't understand from the book is the extent to which the success of the French approach is embedded deep in French history and culture, and the extent to which the success is due to Dolto's influence. Dolto's influence is only two generations old, so that might promise some solution for us in the nearer term.  On the other hand, our increasing failures are also only two generations in the making, so it might be reversible, though I find that increasingly unlikely.  This is a story about appreciation. How children learn to appreciate boundaries. How parents enable and appreciate a child's growing competencies. How to appreciate boundaries for both parents and children. Most importantly, how to appreciate that neither parents nor children are the center of the universe, there are others and there are manners. And, (this is purely French), how to appreciate the subtleties of vegetables.  I came away from this book with two insights. One, this is what we need to do. Two, we can't do it.

B006OAB3ME|5.0|These are the songs that Paul was meant to sing and I'm so glad he's still around to sing them.  His voice has mellowed with age and, although he might not be able to belt the high ones like he used to, the notes he does hit are round, full and as lovely as you could wish for.  My favorites songs on the album are the two he wrote himself.  His songwriting skills are, and have always been, right up there with all of the greats.  Congratulations, Paul, on a thoroughly enjoyable and beautifully crafted CD.  Big kiss on your bottom!<br /><br />And special kudos to Diana Krall for her lovely, understated vocals and rhythm arrangements, Eric Clapton for the signature guitar solo on 'Get Yourself Another Fool' and Stevie Wonder for wrapping it all up so nicely on 'Only Our Hearts'.<br /><br />I haven't stopped listening to this CD since I bought it.  Dreamy...just dreamy...
B0059XTTW8|1.0|This is another sad remake of a great story. Don't bother. It is a mistake to try and take a six-part story and lodge it all into a one-part movie. Avoid this. Buy the real deal.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Awesome start to finish. No it's not one of the first sacred six VH albums. No one can compete with those BUT this is the closest anyone could possibly get. Ed's on fire; he s back and playing with the same virtuoso skills and ferocity that made him the king. Al is lockstep with Ed and has developed a bombastic rhythm section with nephew Wolfgang. Wolfgang has stepped up with solid groove and some bombastic flourishes reminiscent of Billy Sheehan on EEAS (listen to the end of Chinatown for an exaple). Wolf is also stepping up with the background vocals and together with his father and DLR lay down some nice signature VH harmonies. What about Dave? Dave is Dave and it is awesome to have him back. He has evolved from the 1985 days but the fun, the swagger and the attitude that made classic Van Halen classic is back. So buy this bad boy NOW then sit back and enjoy the ride. It took 28 years to get here...and above all, Stay Frosty!

B000PDYVVG|2.0|I know this story is about a woman searching for, well, the meaning of life or really the meaning of her life as she enters a sort of midlife crisis.  I really enjoyed the first journey which was through Italy.  That part was great and I really wanted to like the rest, however I just never made it that far in enjoyment.  I finished the book but I'm just not a fan of this one.<br /><br />Gilbert is a talented writer and this book is written well but just not terribly interesting to read about a person who just eats and travels, has sex and then moves about leaving all responsibilities behind.  I wanted something a little deeper.  It would have been great if the culture of each location was expanded upon.  I'm also not sure why the author felt the need to include her own political opinions in this book.  Didn't seem necessary to the story.  Silly really.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|not as good as the other g5 games but hidden item games are cool. story line ok but doesn't match game really
B002BWP49C|4.0|After all the comments I was prepared for this to be a horrible movie, but it actually was very good.  Solid acting from everyone, screenplay worked well against the book.  It's a great love story.
B004EBUXSA|4.0|This processor is insanely fast! Definitly top notch technology. I made a jump from an Intel Core i3 to this processor and the speed difference is fenominal. If you aren't looking for a gaming computer however I would recommend an Intel Core i5. I took down a star though because one of the features of this specific processor is the overclocking ability and to my surprise the stock fan that came with this processor sucks at cooling it down. I would recommend buying an after market cpu cooler. I had overclocked the processor from 3.40 GHz to 3.80 GHz (taking in mind that it was a stock cpu cooler so I decided to leave it at 3.80 GHz instead of over 4.00 GHz like most people do) and the temperature went up from 40 degrees to 60 degrees. Good thing the motherboard senses the processor temperature and shut the computer off before it reached unstable temperatures.

B005LAIGPA|5.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 2/8/12**  With Chronicle, 2012 has its first great movie. It's easily the most exciting, watchable action/sci-fi film in months. What first-time director Josh Trank was able to accomplish on a shoe-string (at least by Hollywood standards) budget is so cool that it borders on unbelievable.  The story will be familiar to most who have watched any superpower origin tale. More specifically, the script owes a great debt to pioneering 80's anime classic Akira. Three teenagers, one of them weaker, more socially awkward, and ultimately more disturbed, start to develop mysterious powers after an incident outside of a party. Andrew, the younger/weaker of the three (played by the pitch-perfect Dane DeHaan) finds he's able to control his newfound abilities to a greater and more impressive extent than the others. But, due to circumstances not entirely under his control, the powers prove to be too much for him. And thus, we have conflict.  While the story's familiar, the execution is startlingly fresh. Sure, the \\"found footage\\" genre has been around for awhile, but until now, I'm not sure it's ever been exploited to its full potential. Viewing this incredible story through an everyday lens gives the film a naturalistic feel and makes the effects all that more shocking, real and... well... fun. And honestly, \\"fun\\" is what this movie's about. Not that it's super happy or anything, but it's certainly a jolt of guerrilla film-making. In a world of polished studio action movies, this feels more like a couple of (ridiculously creative) storytellers playing around. Of course, it helps that they've got a taut, wonderfully human story at the core. For as awesome and exciting as the set-pieces are, Chronicle doesn't take the easy way out. Its characters feel real and completely sympathetic. In other words, it's really got a bit of everything for everyone. And at just under 90 minutes, it doesn't overstay its welcome. What more could you ask for? A-
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|This CD is electrifying, rejuvenating, truth telling, spiritual directing, artistically creative a great decision for long road trips. A smooth mixture of Hip Hop & a spice of Reggae to it ++++++++. Damien Marley's lyrics were mind blowing, this is a MUST have in your conscious library I wouldn't lie to ya! Afrika Wake up is my fav, in addition to Patience. Hip Hop needed this! Its like water in a desert of all this other mess thats out here

B004A8ZWW4|3.0|You can have a movie whose nature echoes its own motif. A black-and-white movie about years gone by; a movie in three parts about three-ness; a movie told in reverse about retrospection. Even an awesome movie about awesomeness.  What you *can't* do is have a movie that is abysmal-for-the-first-half-then-makes-a-great-comeback about being abysmal but then making a great comeback. It doesn't work. People will lose interest during the first half and quite possibly quit watching. It's a really stupid thing to do, intentional or not. I would bet unintentional in this case.  If you want to know how bad the first half is, read the 1-star reviews. If you want to know how good the second half is, read the 3 and 4 star reviews. No-one with any discernment wrote a 5-star review for this movie. And anyone criticizing it for being derivative ought to know that while fine taste is an asset to enjoying art, a fine memory is not.

B000AM2L1O|5.0|It really can substitute as a teether! Calin's bald head, hands & feet are soft but sturdy enough that a teething child can get relief on & is easy to clean. She is much loved by my nieces. The educational value rating is due to that my nieces give their Calin all the TLC that their mom gives them.
B0071QIN00|4.0|Enjoyed the first edition so snatched this one up.  They have added a few more buttons (prefer buttons over tilt) which concerned me at first, but didn't get in way at all.  I do find the encouraging voice overs and item collection a little distracting though.  They took something that was pseudo realistic and arcade gamed it up.  Worth a checkout and excellent quality for a faotd, but it is slightly less than the first edition due to the cheese.

B006UG90RM|4.0|With everything that has happened within this band since the 1996 soap opera helix of Roth joining, then leaving the band again, fans of the old Van Halen wondered if they would ever again see a new, full studio album.  Filling in that time was Gary Cherone for the VHIII album, Hagar leaving and for a time, doing a dual tour with Diamond Dave, and the eventual Exodus of Founding member and bass player Michael Anthony, subsequently replaced by Eddie's son Wolfgang.  It finally happened, and despite the time that has passed, this album does fulfill something for many fans of that Brown sound with Diamond Dave as the frontman again.  Unlike \\"VHIII\\", This album is much tighter in musicianship and execution.  Sure, you'll hear some familiar licks and riffs of old, but the harmonies, backing vocals and song structure are much, much more polished and flowing.  It may be just a small blast from the past, but it also still embodies what made Van Halen great in the first place; great guitars, a variety of themes in the songwriting, and simply FUN rock.  I miss Michael Anthony on Bass as much as the next VH fan, but let's give Wolfgang in the new VH lineup, and this album, a chance to shine.
B004MWI2M0|5.0|My son (7-1/2) bought this with his allowance and he loved putting this set together. It's neat that there are some moving parts to this and he was able to follow the instructions pretty much all by himself. He absolutely loves the Pirates of the Caribbean series so this was a great addition too the rest of his Pirates Legos.

B0017V7GLC|1.0|Ladytron have been on a downward trajectory since 604, but even Witching Hour was relatively worthwhile. This album screams $ellout from the cover art to the cliched, worthless little songs.  They must have needed money.  No, I really don't need to say anything else.
0143038583|5.0|I bought this a few years back. I love this book!! Michael pollen did a great job. It really makes you think and makes you mad for being more aware of what's going on. It's a good thing though. Highly recommend reading this then passing it on so others can learn.

B006ZDU7QI|5.0|On a hunch of my love for 'Somebody I Used to Know' I purchased this entire album....and I was overly pleased.  Gotye shows influences of everything from Daft Punk to Bob Marley to The Clash and everything in between.  If you have an open mind about music, you will enjoy this entire record beginning to end...time and time again as I have over the last few days.
1410430103|3.0|You have to have a lot of patience to get through this book. The story  is engrossing when you can get to it through all the layers and pages  descriptive text. I read the kindle version and it took 60 pages  to say the Jack Reacher was pulled from a diner while eating breakfast  and charged with a murder he didn't commit and though the investigators  knew he was innocent he was sent to a lockup for the weekend. That's it!  There are sections where you have to skim page after page to get through  the next meaningful anything. I guess some readers will appreciate the  style.  The main character is interesting with a much more varied life  than Harry Bosch. But Lucas Davenport in the \\"Prey\\" series has  is a much more enjoyable read, with lots of cop humor, great dialog,  interesting and likeable characters and more terse writing with no  skimming required!
1607053888|5.0|Just because a girl can never have too many handbags - this book is fab. Subtitled Clutches, hobos, satchels and more, you'll be sure to find several patterns to satisfy your handbag hunger. Chapters are split into small bags, clutches and large bags. There are 19 pattens in all from pencil cases and sunglasses cases to carryalls. Great clear instructions and good quality photos make this book a breeze to use. The pattens are split into skill levels, so this book is for all kinds of stitchers from beginner up. I love the 'Betty wallet' and the 'Veronica day bag' as well as the 'Sweet Annemarie bag.' Stylish and contemporary, this book has something for everyone. Patterns are included. This review first appeared on yarnsandfabrics website.
0393327655|1.0|First two chapters were good but then it becomes an \\"American apologist\\" and justifies torture and the killing of innocent children because \\"America thought it was bombing something else.\\"  Well, perhaps you should have better intelligence before bombing someone.  I read the first 130 pages and then threw it in the fire.  I would give zero stars if possible!
B0071QIN00|1.0|I used this game on my kindle fire. at first the game seemed to ne working okay -- it had decent graphics and all.  then it just froze.

B000KX0HVY|3.0|There are a thousand, thousand ways to package, Elvis Presley the be-bop rock and roll minute king of the 1950s teenage angst night. And for his early work he should be packaged, packaged to eternity. It is the rest of his work that is the problem and hence the problem with this two CD set of what the producers have picked as essential. There are just too many duds, and semi-duds from his later period (the 1960s and 1970s Las Vegas flame-out period). Any essential product has to be top-heavy with 1950s stuff get a nod from me.  From this compilation the obvious classics That's All Right, Heartbreak Hotel, Blue Suede Shoes, Hound Dog, Don't Be Cruel, Jailhouse Rock and It's Now or Never rate a nod. The rest though are strictly a mishmash. And I know from where I speak. Why? Until very, very recently I actually, if you can believe this, did not think much of Brother Presley's music. And I was (and still am somewhat) nothing but a be-bop rock and roll baby boomer boy who could listen to the stuff all day and night. A while back I got hold of a five CD set of Elvis' work from the Sun Record days mainly. That's the Elvis who will live in rock and roll history. Stuff like It's All Right, Mama, I Forgot To Remember To Forget, Good Rockin' Tonight, That's Where Your Heartache Begins, Your Right She's Left and a ton of others. Ya, the stuff from the days when he was hungry, and we were too. This compilation will not satisfy that hunger.

B0034G4OZE|4.0|It's Kind of a Funny Story is a charming, thoughtful, and slightly bittersweet look at teenage depression as well as the pressures of life for all of us and how we cope. The subject matter is well covered in scores of other artistic mediums, but that doesn't devalue this effort. IKOAFS is well written and acted, smoothly directed, and engagingly paced for a light drama.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the acting is superb, especially Zach Galifianakis and the young lead played by Keir Gilchrist. His shy mannerisms and geeky awkwardness are captivating and genuine, no doubt aiding by the fact that he is a teen himself. It's nice to see Galifianakis playing against his clueless stereotype and he handles the subtleties and suppressed self-loathing of his character without trying to steal scenes or chew scenery.<br /><br />Though it has nothing to do with the movie per se, I found myself reflecting upon a small moment in the movie when Gilchrist's \\"Cool\\" Craig is talking with the ward's chief therapist. She asks if he has anyone he can talk to about his problems and it struck me how essential that element is for all our sanity. As Craig learns, and as I have as well in my life, he isn't alone in struggling with depression. Maybe it's a casualty of our increasingly insulated life, stuck to our personal communication devices at the expense of our face-to-face interactions, or maybe I'm simply thinking too much. Be that as it may, in a society buried under countless options for staying perpetually connected with each other, it's amazing how easy it is for our social skills to atrophy or for our sense of reality to get blurred through the anonymity of these technological social venues. What are we losing in the convenience of avoiding depth?<br /><br />It would be easy to criticize the movie's ending but I took heart with it. Living life is not about focusing on the pain and difficulty but focusing instead on the small joys brought about by those we love and the feeling of knowing you're not alone.ng you're not alone.

0062073478|5.0|Even though she has a household name, I didn't know about Agatha Christie's work until I read Amore Towles' \\"Rules of Civility.\\" Until then I probably would've assumed she was the founder of the famed auction house. It's disappointing to realize her name was never mentioned in any of the various English Literature courses I took in college. It probably has something to do with the snobbery that's unfairly issued to genre fiction. Nevertheless, when I learned of the Queen of Mystery I delved in to her work immediately, starting with \\"And Then There Were None.\\" Reading of its premise reminded me of the board game and movie \\"Clue.\\" This was no mistake. Her most widely read book certainly influenced pop culture, and having read it in a two day span I can see why. This is a book that sucks you. I stayed up until 2 AM on a weeknight just to finish it, something I almost never do. The thought of reading about ten different characters might daunt those who want to know everything that lies inside the hearts and psyches of those they read about. Had Christie provided such details I probably would've skipped the book. In Christie's work murder victims get about a half-page of background and that's it. Only detectives and survivors will ever warrant more. At around 250 pages the work is palatable and brisk. The various murder scenes aren't too gruesome for today's tastes and even at age 71 the book is fun, dark, and suspenseful without manipulating its reader.

B004HEXSLI|5.0|I have been practicing meditation for a little over two years and much of Jill's experiences I have also glimpsed through meditation. The techniques of quieting the inner dialogue, not getting caught up in the storylines we are creating, and not biting the hook (see Pema Chodron's book with the same title) of negative emotions are also taught in meditation classes. Jill expalins this phenomena of connecting with the potentialities or right brain engagement in a way that is articulate and easily understandable. I am very grateful for her work.[[ASIN:1605145939 Don't Bite the Hook: Finding Freedom from Anger, Resentment, and Other Destructive Emotions]]
1593082045|5.0|This begins with the \\"Return of Sherlock\\" after the author brought him back to life, thinking he was done writing the series and had killed him off.  Fans revolted and he had to start writing more stories.  A very good addition to anyone's Holmes collection as it provides a load of information not commonly known and a whole new series of stories. I highly recommend this for anyone who likes Sherlock as it helps you dive deeper into the whole experience. Makes an outstanding gift for the right person.
0525478817|5.0|Looking for Alaska is my favorite book of all time, but after reading The Fault in Our Stars, I might have to amend that. This is very stereotypical to say, but it made me laugh, it made me cry, and it left a really big impact on my life. The characters are all so different and lively, and it's really interesting to see the perspective of someone my age going through cancer. Even if you're not into \\"teen\\" books, I really recommend reading The Fault in Our Stars; it's not your average hormonal-teen-falls-in-love novel.
0890090572|5.0|This is a great compilation of the entire Holmes adventures.  Had it several years ago, lended it to someone and never got it back some years ago and just had to have another copy.  Well worth the price for any Holmes lover.
0307352145|2.0|Introverts like me make up one-third of the population, and conduct most of the world's thinking and listening. Examples include Buffett, Chopin, Einstein, Gandhi, Newton, Orwell, Page (Google), Proust, Spielberg, and Yeats. Rosa Parks was another, changing history with just one word, 'No,' when told to move to the back of the bus.<br /><br />Author Cain also questions what she calls the myth of 'charismatic leadership' - all mouth and enthusiasm, with no content or strategy. The latest business-school fad (forced collaboration) is also rightly targeted - my experience has been that adding mouths and diversity accomplishes nothing other than making progress more difficult, if not impossible.<br /><br />My own experience - I initially worked as a computer programmer, just the computer and I. We got a lot done together - the computer quickly pointed out my mistakes, and I wasted no time talking with others. Another author example - Buffett's own analysis vs. the much more social beings that followed each other into massive market losses.<br /><br />I, like most everyone else, have inadvertently eavesdropped on cell-phone conversations between extroverts. The content was ALWAYS trivial! Worse, we've all seen non-stop talkers on their cell-phones while driving, risking their own and everyone else's life. When do these people ever have time to think, learn/find facts, or just rest their minds? And that's similar to what the book's author should have done - quit after about 5 pages.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|This is an exceptionally good movie.  I saw the Swedish version and liked it.  However, this American adaptation of Stieg Larsson's novel is even better.  It tells more of Larsson's story, and although it doesn't stick strictly to the book I think David Fincher's direction makes the story clearer and ties the various themes together better.  The photography and music greatly enhance the movie, and give a haunting, dark, threatening, yet realistic sense of winter in Sweden that adds to the story-telling and deeply illustrates the themes of psychological and physical/sexual abuse. The editing is fantastic, moving the film along strongly and artistically.  Not a moment is wasted, even though it is nearly 3 hours long. Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara are excellent choices for the lead roles, and they interpret their characters with great precision and depth.  Craig's depiction of Blomqvist is really close to Larsson's as he exhibits the journalist's fire and dogged pursuit of his story, as well as the surprise and respect he has for Lisbeth's intellect and weirdness.  Rooney Mara deserves the Oscar nomination for her Lisbeth Salander. I have similar kudos for the rest of the main actors, particularly Christopher Plummer (Henrik Vanger), Stellan Skarsgaard (Martin Vanger), and Yorick Van Waginen (Bjurman).  The opening sequence with the credits is amazing, and some things weren't clear until I'd seen the movie a couple of times---It's not just an artistic introduction with fantastic music, it foretells some theme elements but you don't realize it until after it's over.
0375507256|3.0|Last night I finally finished `Cloud Atlas'. I say finally, because I started it over a month ago. My progress was initially good, whipping through nearly half of it over the course of a few days. Then my interest started to wane, Christmas and all its trappings arrived, and the book got put on hold. Once I settled down to finish it, nearly a month later, the pages turned easily enough, but I can see why my interest started to sputter out when it did.  Oh, that's not to say `Cloud Atlas' isn't a good book. It is; the writing is brilliant, the characters and settings and style are all vivid and engaging, the multiple genres are all well executed (although sometimes it seems an exercise in look-how-talented-I-am by the author. What can I say? He is very talented). I am entirely unsurprised to see it's been nominated for awards left, right, and centre. What this book lacks is an overarching plot. Call me old-fashioned, but I like a good plot in my books.  It makes me a little uneasy, confessing to this opinion. After all, who am I to criticise? If I'm insanely lucky I might one day write a book half as good as `Cloud Atlas'.  And criticising something so obviously `literary' and `deep' probably marks me as someone too thick to `get it'.  Maybe there was a plot, maybe I just missed it. I probably would have felt less unsatisfied by this book if there'd been a description on it somewhere that read something like this:  \\"This book is a collection of loosely connected short-stories with common themes. The first half of the book comprises the first half of each short story, moving forward in chronological order. At the mid-point the second-half of the stories starts to unfold, moving backwards in time.\\"  If I had known this was a book of short stories when I started it, I wouldn't have wasted so much time and energy waiting and searching for the overarching plot.  I did like the device of having to wait for the second half of the book to get the finale of each short story -it certainly heightened the suspense and anticipation. However, as I was convinced that the short stories would all converge in the second half of the book into one glorious climax, hopefully involving time-travel and reincarnation, I was a little taken aback when each story stayed distinct and the book thus ended with a fizzle rather than a bang.  My favourite short story would have to be the penultimate sci-fi flavoured one, featuring a world of 'fabricants' (human clones) who are slaves designed to fill menial service roles. I wish there had been a whole book about that world, rather than a single glimpse.  Overall, this is a very well-written book. If you like 'puzzles', good writing, 'literary' books and don't mind switching genres willy-nilly then this is probably one for you. If you're a fan of the more conventional tale, it may not be your cup of tea.
B006362ZR6|2.0|I love the Fray, but this was not their best album. The music was just as good as it has been in past songs, but all of the lyrics are about love. I'm just not a fan of love songs. So while I liked the music, I just couldn't seem to connect with the lyrics like I have with their past songs like 'Little House' and 'Trust Me'. I would suggest looking up the lyrics to some of the songs before deciding to buy it.  But if you don't care about the lyrics, or you like love songs, then this is definitely a great album. Again, the music rocks as much as it always did. But check out the meaning of the songs.
0440244412|4.0|This is really a review for the series as a whole, as I read all the books over a five day period and can no longer distinguish them from each other in my mind.  First off, let me be clear that I think this series is a very good urban fantasy and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys that genre. The series is very well thought out; the world, the mythology, the twists and turns basically meant I got very little sleep over that five day period. I HAD to know how it all ended! I particularly like all the celtic faerie mythology woven into it, and the focus on the dark aspects of faerie (beauty does not equal goodness).  However, I have to have a wee side rant here:  (1) I HATE Jericho Barrons as a love interest! I love him as a character (he's got so many facets it's hard not to be intrigued by him) but I think he's rubbish as a romantic hero. I was hoping against hope that the \\"happily ever after\\" for Mac would be her becoming a strong, independent woman. Strong enough to realise that even though she might be sexually attracted to Barrons, he's ultimately a b*stard that would make very bad partner material.  (2) My GOD can Mac be irritating! This is both a good and a bad thing. Good because she feels like a realistic character (she has deep flaws and she grows as a character over the course of the books). Bad because her flaws sometimes make her stupid, judgemental, and frustrating to deal with.

B0017YZIL4|5.0|I am a jazz guitarist and huge Wes Montgomery fan. Arguably, Wes' playing on this album is as good as any studio album that he made. As such, it's a must buy album if you have any interest in jazz guitar, at all. Wes Montgomery rises above the pack in the field of jazz guitar, and this album is a wealth of jazz guitar enlightenment. Wes was not the flashiest jazz guitarist, but his musicality, taste, and creativity were unparalleled. Never a wasted note. He never overplayed. Everything he played was a part of an idea, and his vision was about as perfect as it has come on the guitar. If someone said that this should be a first buy for Wes, I can't argue. The only criticism of this album, compared to his other great works, is the tone of his guitar. The ideas contained within this album are a virtual gold mine for aspiring, transcribing guitarists, but they'll be robbed of experiencing Wes' great tone. Wes achieved an absolutely gorgeous sound on guitar and it is not found on this album. As a listening experience, other albums like, \\"Smokin' At The Halfnote\\", \\"Boss Guitar\\", or \\"Further Adventures of Jimmy & Wes\\", to name a few, might be better purchases, in terms of really capturing the full Wes Montgomery experience. With \\"Incredible Jazz Guitar\\" you get supreme playing, but you don't \\"experience\\" the full artistry of Wes. This is not a knock on Wes, but the recording engineers. Wes was noted for verbalizing dissatisfaction with the guitar tone that was achieved on his albums. I can't help but wonder if this was one of the albums that prompted those comments.

B004Q1FDHO|5.0|This game is awesome I think everyone should get this game it is the greatest the best part is blowing up the fish
B005G4TJI4|1.0|Look, I understand that with big-name films, there's going to be multiple home versions of it on any given format. Usually there's the basic version that includes the film and maybe one or two features, like a commentary or some deleted scenes or something, but otherwise pretty minimal stuff. That's fine, considering that they often charge only about $20-30 for that kind of version, and usually release the \\"real\\" special features-heavy version very close to or at the same time as that version. It makes sense, since we think we're getting the \\"real\\" version by paying more money for something that should be there to begin with. But the existence of the basic version tricks us into buying the \\"real\\" version, like it's some ultra-special edition, and to own the basic edition is a mark of shame. It makes sense, really. I mean, would you want the crap version of the film with nothing on it but the basic theater version? Of course you wouldn't. But we'll still charge you $10 extra for the \\"real\\" version under the pretext that it's a special edition of some kind, instead of the reality that it's the only version they expect you to buy at some point if you're a fan of the film.  So, you can see where I'm going here. This is the absolute bare-bones version of the film, with absolutely *zero* special features. No commentaries, no deleted scenes or outtakes, no featurettes, nothing. You get the film. No more.  We'll still charge you $30-40 for it, though. And the special edition, which will be released several months later, will cost just as much if not more than this version. So, what are you going to do? Spend the cash now for the basic version, or be the last to own it at home while waiting months for the real version with all the cool stuff? It puts you in an impossible dilemma that you can't escape. See, production companies have found that people often buy the basic version if they release it at the same time as the special edition, since people often don't care about anything but the film, and will gladly take the reduced price. That changes when they're spread out this far apart. This adds a whole new dimension of what's worth what--and I guarantee you that people are trading in their old editions for the new one right now, and in bundles, just as the studio always planned.  It's great marketing, sure, but it's also an obvious ripoff that doesn't even bother to hide that it's a ripoff. We could have at the very least been given some kind of commentary, bare minimum. Anything, really. Just...Anything. I mean, this is a full-price Blu-ray with a pretty moot digital copy, but it doesn't include what that often entails.  This, in a word, sucks. Hard. They threw out the Blu-ray as fast as humanly possible, while planning the entire time to release a real edition with special features out the whazoo. Studios are always trying to cash in on big-name films with their home releases, especially considering how awful box offices are doing these days (with the insane ticket prices and ridiculous emphasis on no-effort 3D effects, they should have seen that coming), but while I think this deserves no stars for being downright deceptive (no pun intended), you can't blame the studios for pulling off what works to get the most money for the least effort. So, here you go: Transformers 3 on Blu-ray, with all the audio and visual bells and whistles, just without any special features to speak of. And they know that by the time the \\"real\\" edition comes out, this'll drop in price so much that it'll have the image of being the bad version. Many of you will trade in the original for the new one, and I don't blame you. If you want those special features, you have no choice. This is how they operate, and it works. You don't have to like it, since money speaks for itself in this kind of massive industry.  As a final note, I remember the days when DVDs basically always had two versions that came out at the same time: The basic single-disc version, and the \\"2-disc special edition\\" version. Almost all movies with any impact did that. The key difference is that both came out at the same time, so you had a reasonable choice to make. One was typically $10 more than the other, maybe even less. The decision was clear, and everything was laid out. Not so here, not anymore. Now you don't even know what the special features are going to be ahead of time, and you're gambling that you can live with the basic version many months after the basic version is released. This kind of trend is very disturbing with the studios taking advantage of this, but again, it just works. The studios are frothing with excitement as people trade in their old Blu-rays for the new special one, just as they always wanted. They're getting literally more than double than what they would normally get if they did it the traditional way, since you're basically buying the movie twice if you fell into this trap.  This version sucks, and cons you into buying it anyway. Maybe you're the type who simply does not care at all about anything except the film, and special features and maybe some video and audio corrections aren't a big deal. Well, then you can probably live with this. If not, then, well, they've got the problem and the solution right here.
0525457585|5.0|Some books can touch frozen archetypal currents within us and entice them into flowing again. This is one such book. Ende has adapted the Hero's Journey to fit modern sensibilities, to rekindle enchantment with a world in which imagination, dreams, fantasies and wishes are temporarily saved from invisibility of the real. I found the book to be profound and touching. It is an entrance into Ende's world of magic, mystery, beauty and endless surprise... a world as strange and alluring as it is familiar.

1400052181|5.0|Rebecca Skloot has written a fascinating account about the gathering and utilization of human cells for medical research.  It has achieved widespread acclaim for its appeal in both the scientific and lay communities.  But there's much more.  This book is also an ode to friendship, even love, as Skloot gathers together a wildly unbalanced family in an attempt to calm their cynical minds.  THE IMMORTAL LIFE OF HENRIETTA LACKS has been a runaway best seller since it was first published in 2010.  It's amazing that a complicated topic would have such universal appeal.  But give the author credit for taking a complex scientific subject, simplifying it, and infusing it with human interest, making the reader feel intelligent while still being entertained.  It's a detective story with a technical background featuring real people you care about.  One can imagine the emotion of having parts of a dead family member, in this case a mother, divided and spread around the world for purposes not fully understood.  What parts are being used?  What are they being used for?  And what does it mean when you are told your beloved will live forever when you know she's dead?  Although you might not accept the answers, being well educated might make them easier to grasp.  But being totally ignorant about human cells, their study and usage, and medical procedures and their consequences, having a dead mother involved would surely cause great angst to most of us.  Add the constant badgering of a notoriously ill mannered and prying news media and one can appreciate the torment to the remaining members of the Lacks family.  We meet Deborah Lacks, Henrietta's daughter.  She is troubled and vehemently opposed to further discussions of her mother's death and subsequent cell distribution.  The rest of the family point to her as the final hurdle Skloot must overcome to get information about Henrietta's turbulent life.  But she's not talking.  Skloot's accounts of the gradual steps she must take to gain Deborah's cooperation are touching and brilliantly presented.  The remaining family members reluctantly follow along.  There is continuing scientific debate about the virulence of Henrietta Lacks's cells, or HeLa, as they are commonly known.  They have powerful growth qualities and are eternal when most others don't even survive first cultivation.  Her family had many ideas about that, mostly based on supposition or superstition.  Some thought it was God's punishment for various transgressions by Henrietta.  Others thought it was God's punishment for Adam's eating of Eve's apple or, perhaps, disease-causing spirits that hovered over Henrietta. One thought it possible that something alive had crawled into Henrietta, killed her, and kept on living.  One thing was for sure.  None of them knew what was happening to Henrietta either before or after her death.  This created the anger and distrust that Rebecca Skloot was battling against to get her story together.  The living relatives had much to distrust when it came to science, not the least being an inherent fear of any scientific experimentation with black people based on past experiences being widely publicized at the time.  And there was the idea that a lot of money was being made with Henrietta's body parts, and the family members, who desperately needed financial assistance, were not getting one dime of it.  Skloot tackles all these perplexing situations in an analytical and nonjudgmental manner.  She is the embodiment of an investigative journalist; probing, indefatigable, brave.  She is also a talented writer, but there is more than that about her.  She gets intensely involved with Henrietta Lacks's survivors and her honesty and genuine affinity with their plight gains their reluctant cooperation. It took her ten years to do that.  I was amazed at the depth of research in the book, the beauty and simplicity of the writing, and the importance of the subject.  I believe this book deserves the highest prize for literature and that Rebecca Skloot's debut effort is nothing short of sheer genius.  Schuyler T Wallace  Author of TIN LIZARD TALES

I never watched the 2nd one and when this one came out I heard a lot of good things from other people I know that it was an awesome movie. Let me just say that this movie was a complete waste of my time. I was very disappointed after hearing all good things about it. It was way too slow for me and boring. The scary parts weren't even that scary. Good thing I only spent $1.20 renting it.

Ginny's husband Dan is useless at everything from putting the cradle together to finding the street the classes are in, and she lets him know it. Petal Harmon's classes are supposed to be life changing, but so far, Ginny's not all that impressed. But tonight's the last class, and this will be something different.

0393338398|5.0|This book tells the story of the Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane and his team building philosophy/approach. Billy has focused on drafting undervalued or overlooked players and building a great team on a budget. Unlike most of his GM peers, Billy and his team rely on empirical statistics to make decisions on a more systematical fashion. He understands that to beat the other teams who have much largers budgets he cannot play the same game they are. Instead he applies - what I call - a Benjamin Graham value investing style approach to picking players (stocks) and building a team (portfolio). The outcome a team that pays the lowest on a per win basis within the league.<br /><br />Michael does it again, with his great story telling approach to reporting. A recommended read for any baseball or business enthusiast alike.<br /><br />Below are key excerpts from the book:<br /><br />1) \\"The meetings, from their point of view, are all about minimizing risk. They can't afford to have guys not work out. There's no point in taking risks on players temperamentally, or legally, unsuited to pro ball.\\"<br /><br />2) \\"We're blending what we see but we aren't allowing ourselves to be victimized by what we see.\\"<br /><br />3) \\"When Alderson entered the game he wanted to get his mind around it, and he did. He concluded that everything from on-field strategies to player evaluation was better conducted by scientific investigation - hypotheses tested by analysis of historical statistical baseball data - than by reference to the collective wisdom of old baseball men. By analyzing baseball statistics you could see through a lot of baseball nonsense.\\"<br /><br />4) \\"Managers tend to pick a strategy that is least likely to fail rather than pick a strategy that is most efficient,\\" said Palmer. \\" The pain of looking bad is worse than the gain of making the best move.\\"<br /><br />5) John Henry: \\"People in both fields operate with beliefs and biases. To the extent you can eliminate both and replace them with data, you gain a clear advantage. Many people think they are smarter than others in the stock market and that the market itself has no intrinsic intelligence - as if it's inert. Many people think they are smarter than others in baseball and that the game on the field is simply what they think it is through their set of images/beliefs. Actual data from the market means more than individuals perception/belief. The same is true in baseball.\\"<br /><br />6) \\"The important thing is not to recreate the individual,\\" Billy Bean would later say. \\"The important thing is to recreate the aggregate.\\"<br /><br />7) \\"No matter how successful you are, change is always good. There can never be a status quo. When you have no money you can't afford long-term solutions, only short-term ones. You have to always be upgrading. Otherwise you're fu**ed.\\"<br /><br />8) \\"The day you say you have to do something, you're screwed. Because you are going to make a bad deal. You can always recover from the player you didn't sign. You may never recover from the player you signed at the wrong price.\\"<br /><br />9) \\"Know exactly what every player in baseball is worth to you. You can put  dollar figure on it.\\"<br /><br />10) \\"Know exactly what you want and go after him.\\" (Never mind who they say they want to trade.)<br /><br />11) \\"Every deal you do will be publicly scrutinized by subjective opinion. If I'm [IBM CEO] Lou Gerstner, I'm not worried that every personnel decision I make is going to wind up on the front page of the business section. Not everyone believes that they know everything about the personal computer. But everyone who ever picked up a bat thinks he knows baseball. To do this well, you have to ignore the newspapers.\\"<br /><br />12) Bill James: \\"1) Every form of strength covers one weakness and creates another, and therefore every form of strength is also a form of weakness and every weakness is a strength. 2) The balance of strategies always favors the team which isbehind. 3) Psychology tends to pull the winners down and push the losers upwards.\\"<br /><br />13) \\"I learned that if you look long enough for an argument against reason you will find it.\\"ent against reason you will find it.\\"
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I didn't think that pulling off a high quality video production of a stage musical, particularly Phantom, was possible. But Really Useful has done it. For true Phans, this disc is worth every penny. And it wasn't a special \\"cameras only\\" event, they had a full house to entertain behind the cameras.  It is clear throughout the program that the set is a special 25th anniversary arrangement, specifically for the purpose of accommodating the cameras. The most obvious difference from the Broadway/London/tour regular sets is the use of a digital video background which enlarges the size of symbolic items for more dramatic effect. The orchestra is actually above the main stage, moved out of the way, no doubt, for cameras to move about in the pit. Even so, it makes for a spectacle to behold.  What is so amazing about this video is it is the exact, full stage production. Nothing has been changed for a television audience or timing. The performers are incredibly passionate throughout every scene, and in my opinion show more raw emotion than most film actors in modern times. Speaking of film, this is ten times better than the theatrical adaption of Phantom. It was filmed beautifully in high definition, so you get to see things even the audience can't see, or things you miss when seeing it in person. You can see every movement the performers make, the sweat on their faces, subtle costume rearrangements, and yes - even the microphones. But even the ability to see all that does not take away one ounce of the enjoyment of the performance.  If you've seen the stage production in person and cannot get enough of it, this is going to help soothe your addiction. At the end, Andrew Lloyd Webber takes the stage and leads the anniversary party, introducing many former company members - including the originals. Seeing former Phantoms get to take the stage again lights up their eyes, and it's just a great thing to watch. Looks like it was a heck of a night. There is also a behind the scenesfeature to get an idea of what it's like to be a player. Enjoy!

The sound quality is brilliant as is the way that Carole King and James Taylor just enjoy themselves reliving their music together. It was great to be able to be there.

0307352145|4.0|Interesting enough read on the introversion/extroversion aspects of personality psychology. I'm not huge on labels, and probably could have done with less on the underlying pathology of the labels (and the sociology of those who carry them), and more on leveraging specific personality styles to their best effect. For that reason, I found the last third of the book the most interesting, and I loved the brief conclusion in which she beautifully summed up what one should take away from the book (a brief \\"Introvert's Guide to Life\\").<br /><br />The note on the dedication, immediately following the conclusion, was also, oddly enough, one of the more moving bits of the book.

B006VREN86|5.0|I made the mistake of overlooking HBO's Boardwalk Empire in 2010.  Then I read about the project recently and decided to give it a try. It turned out to be stunningly good. Fair warning - if you are turned off by graphic violence, you won't like Boardwalk Empire. But it's about much more than than that. It's a tapestry that recreates an fascinating place and time, and adds tremendous color and personality - and more storyline twists than a wooden roller coaster.    Boardwalk Empire is a fine historical gangster drama set in prohibition-era 1920s Atlantic City.  Backed by Executive Producer Martin Scorsese (who directs the premiere episode), the series features a smorgasbord of acting talent, led by Steve Buscemi as the sociopathic gangster Nucky, his protagonist Michael Shannon who brilliantly plays a darkly fanatical  Treasury agent, and Kelly Macdonald (No Country for Old Men).    Awards? It's won a bathtub of gin full: Screen Actor's Guild Award for Best Ensemble in a Drama Series, Steve Buscemi won the Screen Actor's Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series,  and Martin Scorsese won the Directors Guild Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Dramatic Series Source: [...]    Following the successful model of HBO's Rome, woven into the plot are a full complement of historical figures: Al Capone, Arnold Rothstein, Eddie Cantor, Lucky Luciano , Meyer Lansky, Warren G. Harding, Johnny Torrio. Buscemi's Nucky is based on Enoch L. Johnson who actually was the corrupt Treasurer of Atlantic City back then.    It is great to see Steve Buscemi in the lead role here, and observe the verisimilitude of his acting talent which is very impressive indeed. He portrays a character of lonely vulnerability, who is as ruthless and shrewd as they come. Who else can do that but Buscemi? The Screen Actor's Guild Award is well-deserved.    Michael Shannon gives a wonderful performance as a dark, brooding, conflicted, apocalyptic Treasury prohibition agent. Elliott Ness, he ain't.    Then there is the icing on the acting cake, all the other performances large and small.. Dabney Coleman as a rheumatic, wicked, vengeful, rageaholic political boss.. Gretchen Mol as a gangster Moll, a sex-starved, ruthless showgirl - and devoted mother.. the list goes on.    Finally, the show has gotten well-deserved praise for the high quality of the visual recreation of Atlantic City in the 1920s. As someone who lived on the boardwalk in Atlantic City for months while on a Casino consulting gig, I was delighted to see the beautiful attention to detail in the film's production design. Special effects magic took the real buildings and morphed them back in time. But they are the real buildings, on Boardwalk, not a phony Hollywood version.    I can appreciate that something about the lost glory of the place called out to the makers of Boardwalk Empire. Five stars.    Can't wait for Season II to come out on Amazon!

B0071QIN00|5.0|This game is awesome. Runs great on my EVO 4g. Reminds me of a very updated version of ExciteBike! I totally recommend this one!
B0042EJD8A|5.0|This movie is a must see for everyone because it can affect you no matter where you live.  They are drilling and hydrofracturing now in PA. OH, VA, TX, OK, and even in California, near Monteray!  It has been known to destroy your source of clean water. WATCH THIS!
B004I744AS|5.0|For the intellectually curious this is a destination app of its own. Great homepage, exhaustive definitions, and various tools for finding the word or concept you seek. Highly recommend!
0671027344|4.0|Great reading material for casual reading  for your teen. My granddaughter was so proud  when I gave this book to her. I always  preview the books myself, though, before  I give them to my granddaughter (s).
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Gorgeous cover- fits the kindle fire perfectly.  Looks exactly like leather and is worth every penny.  I feel awesome carrying this beauty around!
B0052GACNM|5.0|I have enjoyed the duets II/series very much.  It had to be you, one of my all time favorites.  It is great to hear voices blend, and at the same  time, not take away from the great songs. Nothing  like sentimental love songs; treasures from the past  Today with Tony!
B006OAB3ME|2.0|i don't get it. paul's voice is not that sweet anymore. the voice is sort of tired already. i was waiting for an original album written, composed and sang by my fav beatle. something is wrong here. this type of music is not suited for you..paul. imagine mick jagger singing that kind of songs. the songs are not terrible but it does not fit into pauls style that fans all over the world have come to know and love....ewwww
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love the variety. there are several games that I like to play over &amp; over - very fun.  the price is right!
B001QKSWOE|5.0|This is my favorite of the Stephanie Plum books. Carl is a hoot! Diesel is my favorite of the guys, which is probably why I like the \\"Between the Numbers\\" books best.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It would be better if it did not do ads. But it is an amusing app. I would most definitely recommend to a friend.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love spider app on the kindle fire! its one of the funnest games on my kindle. when I'm bored I just click and have an intense game of spider! lol luv it ;)

B006C1DH92|1.0|This App freezes really bad on my Kindle Fire...and I am not happy with it at all. I purchased it on my android and it works great on there...
B000KFTWIG|5.0|In 1994 When \\"Ready To Die\\" First Came Out It Was Everywhere, If You Lived In New York(The Same Way That \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin\\" Was In 2003). I Was A Kid Back But When I Got 17, I Decided That I Would Buy It But Unfortuately The CD Was Pulled From Stores Because Of The Ohio Players Sample On The Title Track. The Cd Was Remastered Afterward And The Sample From The Track Was Removed And Bad Boy Added \\"Who Shot Ya\\" And \\"Dreams\\" Plus A DVD With All The Videos From The Album....Not Bad But If You Dont Care About The DVD And You Already Own \\"Born Again\\" Which Has \\"Who Shot Ya\\" On It Already All Your Really Getting Extra Is A B-Side That You Can Cherry Pick From The Remastered Version (MP3's) And A Song Thats Missing A Sample.....I Wanted The Original So Thats What I Got, It Was Used But I Got It. The Album Is Great If You Dont Care About The Missing Sample Buy The Remastered Version. If Your Like Me The Extra Songs + The \\"One More Chance Remix\\" Will Run You A Grand Total Of A Extra 3 Dollars.
B006UG90RM|3.0|There's been such an overblown response to this album, I am floored. Sure, it is better than anything the band has done in quite some time but it's not up there with their masterworks. There's some quality tracks, some cool Eddie shredding but the songs aren't definitive Van Halen.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Awesome!  This is very much well worth buying.  I just bought the Pro version after trying the free one.  The free version doesn't allow you to upload files to the Android device from your computer, but will let you download files from your Android device to your computer.  No more messing with a USB cable for me!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of different games but not all accessible at beginning. games should be able to be opened with less points.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Exactly what I expected from a solitaire game!  Easy to understand, no lagging or problems while playing, works great on my kindle fire. I love it!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Humerous, witty, and suspensful - you can't help but fall in love with the series!  You may as well buy seasons 2, 3, and 4 right now!
B006TJXZ30|2.0|The app keeps crashing in ICS on Galaxy Nexus...please help with an update.  The app worked fine when first installed but now doesn't work at all...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. some of the games are challenging and others are easy enough to earn the points you need to move on.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Does everything I need it to. Remotely controls my desktop and plays the content onthe kindle fire. Amazon prevents music and video streaming unless it's through their service. Splashtop bypasses that and plays directly to your device without leaving your network. Haven't tried it outside my network but works beautifully and seamslessly whithin it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found Wool by accident by browsing through books on Amazon.  It had good reviews and the price was right so I bought it.  Now, after reading all 5 books in the series I still crave more.  Hugh Howey has created a compelling drama within a unique environment.  It reminded me a little of the castle in the Gormenghast Trilogy by Mervyn Peake.  An enclosed world within a world where the curious yearn for freedom.  The author spins his yarn (pardon the pun) with great detail and skilled dialogue.  The characters are well developed and fully fleshed.  This story hits a raw nerve that must be almost universally felt judging by the accolades from those of us who have spent some time running up and down the great stairway of the silo.  I feel lucky to have stumbled upon this gem and this emerging author.  I have read the Molly Fyde series and Half Way Home and they are just as good.  Hugh Howey goes on my short list of authors whose books are eagerly anticipated and avidly read.

B006UG90RM|1.0|Are you all serious out there?? Comparing this lump of coal to any of their classic recordings is just plain wrong.  Yeah the music is rockin' and Eddie is shredding better than ever...but where are the good songs?  Terrible lyrics and the melodies are missing. As soon as Dave opens his mouth the song goes to hell.  This is more like Dave's solo stuff not Van Halen. People are going nuts over this CD, probably because there isn't much else out there to listen too besides Nickelback and Daughtry on rock radio, but this is just plain boring. Where's the kick drum in the mix?? Where's the singalong choruses? Where is the reason to listen to this more than once except to try and figure out the mystery behind the reason so many people like it??  Don't get me wrong, I love Van Halen. My favorite tunes are DOA,Bring your whiskey home and I'll wait. This Cd has no such gems...point blank junk.
145162445X|5.0|I learned so much by reading this book! Krauss has whet my appetite and I plan on following this book with more of his works as well as those of Stenger and Sagan. After reading Krauss it truly amazes me that anyone would find physics void of beauty. I'm sure no one reading, and enjoying, this book will be surprized that it was Dawkins and Hitchens who sparked my interest to buy this book in the first place.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app.  Easy to use with lots of translations. I would recommend this to anyone. It is a handy tool. Many of versions havean audio feature for listening. Versions are downloadable so wi-fi isn't necessary to read.
B001MTENOC|2.0|The book is an interesting read. He is defiantly touching on some glimps of afterlife. We are spirits incapsulated in this physical body at this space time. We are most defiantly existed before. That is why this book seems to carry some sort of truth and may relate to our inner knowledge. We know deep down inside that we are more then mare mortals.  Now, here is the deal here. I will put this right upfront. I am a Christian. At this point some may just stop reading.  If you continued here is my view on Mr. Newtons philosophy. It voids the need for Christianity all together. We continue learning, and developing thrue these many lives and eventually we are going to be with God. So it's kind of a done deal. There is no need for Christ. There's no need for choice, no matter what we choose we will end up with God sonner or later. It's all nice but in my mind it's about my choice. I can choose to live a thousand lives and perfect so much or I can choose to accept a gift of God and be with him as a spirit not because I'm perfect but because he forgives my imperfections and chooses to be with me. That is why the whole Christianity is all about. So to me. It's either this or thousand lives and self perfection.  This just does not work together at all.  I think there's some glimps of truth and a lot of wishful writings that is no more then a modern day philosophy on the subject of life and death.  Another point that I want to mention is how does this book changes our life? Does it make me love my fellow human being more? Or does it tell me that no matter what I do it's all learning and therefore good???  Now you think for yourself.
0553801473|2.0|I enjoyed the first book or two in the series, and my compulsive desire to finish what I start has kept me reading through the latest installment, but honestly the last two or maybe three books (and especially this one!) were a waste of my time. I feel that the series has devolved into chronicling the random Brownian motion of innumerable characters wandering about, going nowhere and accomplishing nothing. Apparently publishing companies are unwilling to impose an editor on bestselling authors, and Martin is unwilling or unable to self-edit, so here we are, with 959 pages of sound and fury signifying nothing.<br /><br />Another few gripes that I've been nursing throughout this series:<br /><br />1) When I started Book 1, I was not particularly thrilled with the fact that half of the characters were toddlers, tweens, and teens. If I was into children's literature, I'd read Harry Potter. I assumed that, over the course of a billion or so pages, we would get to see at least some of these youngsters grow up into believable protagonists, and I could stop \\"suspending my disbelief\\" in little kids doing the heavy plot-lifting of 30-year-olds. Sadly, after five books only a year or two has passed in story time, and I still have to consciously fight the feeling that I'm reading a Hardy Boys mystery. According to Martin he originally intended to have a five-year gap between two of the books so that some of the characters could mature. Instead, I guess he felt the need to describe every day in the life of each of his 500 main characters throughout those years. (Only three or four more years to go!)<br /><br />2) And what's up with the timeline? Our toddlers and tweens are still toddlers and tweens despite the fact that several lifetimes feel like they've gone by. Arya, for instance, has been through two major training regimens (Water Dancer and Face Dancer or whatever she is now) that have significantly augmented her skills, and has traveled by foot, horse, and ship over a vastworld, having spent the better part of a book or two just wandering aimlessly back and forth across Westeros. During this time wars have been fought, armies have traveled across continents several times, cities have been sacked and rebuilt, dragons have grown big enough to ride...all in one or two years!! What manner of world is this where 11-year-olds can master such skills after what can only have been a few weeks of training?<br /><br />3) I started out being pleased with the fact that Martin isn't afraid to kill off his important characters. He has discussed how he feels it is important to let his readers know that he is \\"playing for keeps.\\" I applaud that. OK then, so what's up with all these resurrections of characters who had been declared dead? I've actually lost count of how many times Martin has played this \\"fooled ya\\" game. There are multiple instances of the ol' switcheroo, where we find out that a character we thought was executed had been replaced by a patsy at the last minute and is actually alive and well. Add to this several actual, magical resurrections. So where does that leave \\"playing for keeps?\\" All tension is gone when the \\"Law of Death\\" is broken (thank you, Stephen Donaldson), and I would no longer be surprised if Ned Stark galloped in at the end of the series to save the day.<br /><br />(Heh heh, maybe the sequel to \\"Game of Thrones\\" should have been \\"Playing for Keeps.\\" Sorry.)<br /><br />All that aside, I could deal with my other pet peeves if this whole unwieldy mess didn't just degenerate into a bunch of random, endless, pointless roaming around. One of the other reviewers suggested that this is probably what you get when a bestselling author who can do whatever he wants gets paid by the word. He was right. Or to use Martin's favorite and slightly more profitable phrase, \\"he was not wrong.\\"
B0071QIN00|5.0|this is.a very fun game that is addicting. it has something new on every level and never bores u :)
B006H3MIV8|5.0|I bought this CD set and brought it home--in passing four CDs for what 10 years ago one often cost--and put it on and groaned. The versions were jarring and different stylistically and hey I thought Dylan did them better! I couldn't even console myself by saying \\"Yeah but its for a good cause--\\" because, frankly, if I was to choose a politically active charity, it would not be Amnesty (they aren't bad, just seem to be fading a bit in relevance)--so I downloaded the CDs down to my MP3 player and forgot about it.....<br /><br />Which was great, cause when the songs came up individually and I wasn't expecting a Dylan song, I was impressed with 1) How incredible these songs actually ARE! 2) How a little change brings a whole new interpretation to the song's lyrics. Chimes of Freedom does not work (to put it mildly) as a coherent album--the style changes are too jarring and the performers are all too different. But hearing a single song (especially when you are not expecting to) often means you have a pleasant rediscovery of a classic Dylan song and see how STRONG the song really is independent of Dylan's original interpretation. Dylan is a GREAT musician and a GREAT singer--but these CDs drive home that for all his strengths as an interpreter of his own material--he is even a GREATER songwriter.<br /><br />Last year, a flurry of rumors suggested the Swedes were actually considering Dylan for the Nobel Prize for literature. Even though I thought he was superior to many of the fourth rate Scandenavian authors who HAVE won,I still thought the idea slightly silly. Now I'm not so sure. Maybe noble Bob should be Nobel Bob.....
B0071T5PN0|4.0|You can sample the tracks for yourself, so I'll keep it short and give you a history to go on. As someone who had every VH album with Dave and continued seeing the band live and buying albums up to around the time \\"Right Now\\" became a Pepsi commercial, I was pleasantly surprised. Simply put, this is Van Halen at nearly 60. They aged, but the guys from 1984 (minus the criminally absent Mike Anthony) are still in there too. The album put a smile on my face and it sounds to me like the band may have even cracked a smile while recording it.

0385344228|5.0|Despite a few slow passages Defending Jacob was, for me, a can't put down sort of book.  One of the main sources of tension in the novel was the disconnect between the facts and what was being reported by the  narrator, Andy, Jacob's father.  One example of Andy's unreliability is his depiction of the prosecutor, a flawed character to be sure, but one who makes many valid points throughout the novel that are totally dismissed by Andy.  For one thing, Logiudice objects to Andy taking over the murder case, citing a possible conflict of interest, something Andy won't admit to, but which is a reasonable point. Also, although continually maligned by Andy, Logiudice puts on on a generally competent prosecution of Jacob.  Further evidence of Andy's unreliability is when he jumps on a sex offender as the murderer and is quite willing to prosecute him, despite no evidence at the beginning and flimsy evidence later on that he was involved.  Andy claims to be certain the man is the murderer, but I think he is being completely disingenuous and would have been willing to send the man to jail for life if it would save his son.  Andy repeatedly asserts that Jacob is innocent, but I think he believes his son is guilty.  In many ways the novel is a game in which we try to discern what are really the facts through the distorted mirror presented by Andy.  There are also fascinating parallels between the violent tendencies of Jacob and the violence Andy appears to be capable of (as when he attacks the sex offender).  And there are indications that, like his son, Andy often lacks empathy.  A fascinating novel.

B0071QIN00|5.0|Fun game, nice visuals, pretty difficult tracks and the best thing is that it works with the controls on my Xperia Play!
B0067QPVD2|3.0|I and I'm sure a lot others mostly got the movie to see a new 2011 prequel version of the 1980's movie The Thing,  while the special effects and scenes where the Thing absorbs and duplicates someone is great none of the cast are very intriguing or don't seem even remotely worth caring about.  If you saw the 80's version then you would probably remember when Kurt Russell's character goes to the burned out Norwegian arctic base after a seemingly crazed member from that base goes on a shooting rampage apparently trying to kill a runaway dog.  This movie of of curse gives us the story on what happened there before that calamity happens.  You have the standard group who after the Thing awaken star to of course distrust one another not knowing who could be the Thing.  The acting is about above a B-movie rating but just barely, but let's be real we didn't really get this movie for the acting as so much getting to see the new version of The Thing in action. So while you'll get decent action and pretty cool effects don't expect any academy award winning acting in the movie are even really caring on what happens to them really.
0385344228|4.0|This was a well written story.  Flashing from testimony in front of a grand jury to the story around that testimony.  I thought the plot was well planned and the characters were created and beleivable.  Throughout the stroy you didn't know if the main character as guilty or innocent and every chpater it changed and surprise end to the book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|cool and different with interesting play and very User friendly. fun for group of friends to play. you should get it
B0067LY4WG|4.0|I was first exposed to Leonard Cohen's music at the age of 17 when I went to the movie theater to see a new film called \\"Pump Up The Volume\\" starring Christian Slater. He played two Leonard Cohen tracks: \\"If It Be Your Will\\" and \\"Everybody Knows\\", which inexplicably did not end up on the film's soundtrack (yet for some strange reason Concrete Blonde's version of \\"Everybody Knows\\" did). It was later that I bought \\"I'm Your Man\\". No sooner had I done that, but I went back to the movie theater to see a new film called \\"Natural Born Killers\\" which had \\"The Future\\" and \\"Waiting For The Miracle\\" in it. In the mid-1990's I bought all of Cohen's work and have been revisiting it over the past 15 years or so.<br /><br />To me, Cohen is a master like Tom Waits, Randy Newman, Johnny Cash, Warren Zevon, Bob Dylan and Paul Simon. Yet, his music is an acquired taste. I'd say the more I've listened to his albums, the more I've come to enjoy him. I'm glad, at age 77, Cohen is set to earn his first top 10 album of his career. There should be more of this and less of what's youthful and popular out there.<br /><br />\\"Old Ideas\\" is diverse, and shows Cohen ruminating on death \\"Going Home\\" and religion \\"Different Sides\\" and pining for a lost love \\"Anyhow\\" and tolerating a loved one \\"Crazy To Love You\\". This is all done in typical Cohen-esque poetic style. Again, Cohen takes a minimalistic approach in terms of arrangements. He gets in and gets out without going astray. \\"Old Ideas\\" is surprisingly brisk and neatly packaged from an artist in the winter of his life.<br /><br />While \\"Old Ideas\\" isn't Cohen's best work, it is certainly worth four stars. I think my favorite tracks are \\"Going Home\\", \\"Amen\\", \\"Show Me The Place\\" and \\"Different Sides\\". I'm hoping we'll get more from Cohen before it gets too late. I'd love to have new music from him when he's 85 or 100. He's setting a new precedent that age doesn't always interfere with creativity.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Old Ideas\\" compares with Cohen's other work:<br /><br />1967 The Songs Of Leonard Cohen: Five Stars<br />1969 Songs From A Room: Three and a Half Stars<br />1971 Songs Of Love And Hate: Four Stars<br />1974 New Skin For The Old Ceremony: Four Stars<br />1977 Death Of A Ladies' Man: Three Stars<br />1979 Recent Songs: Three Stars<br />1984 Various Positions: Four Stars<br />1988 I'm Your Man: Five Stars<br />1992 The Future: Four Stars<br />2001 Ten New Songs: Four Stars<br />2004 Dear Heather: Four Stars<br />2012 Old Ideas: Four Starsonard Cohen: Five Stars  1969 Songs From A Room: Three and a Half Stars  1971 Songs Of Love And Hate: Four Stars  1974 New Skin For The Old Ceremony: Four Stars  1977 Death Of A Ladies' Man: Three Stars  1979 Recent Songs: Three Stars  1984 Various Positions: Four Stars  1988 I'm Your Man: Five Stars  1992 The Future: Four Stars  2001 Ten New Songs: Four Stars  2004 Dear Heather: Four Stars  2012 Old Ideas: Four Stars
B006W0QOF2|1.0|I have never written a review on here before but I felt like I needed to for this movie. My boyfriend and I were so excited to watch this movie and after about 5 minutes we were regretting that decision. I couldn't even make it through the entire thing. Honestly this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am a very easy person to please when it comes to movies. There are not many movies I dislike but this movie was so horrible I could not believe that would release something like this. This movie might be for some people but it was definitely not for me!

B005HSG3VK|5.0|I wanted a cover that is lightweight and has a nice grippy feel to it.  I looked at it several times, but because of the bad reviews I kept looking at other ones.  Glad I finally decided to just go ahead and try it.  It is very form fitting and sleek.  The back kind of feels like the actual back of the Kindle Fire.  It is actually some kind of soft rubbery feel layer over the hard plastic layer which looks like it would protect well enough.  The front has a rubber, grippy feel, as well. The two sides do have a different feel, the back is a bit more grippy feel.  The front is also lined on the inside with felt to protect the front of your kindle.  The strap on the back is there to wrap around the front cover when not in use.  Or when the cover is open you can use the strap to hold it open.  For using in horizontal viewing, the front cover folds and rests on an indentation in the back.  It is functional and I have propped it while on my bed and it stays.  Some people complained about being flimsy in this aspect.  I suppose if you were moving around alot it would collapse (slip out of the indentation), but so would any other cover.  I will leave it in this most of time, but was pleased that the Marware case/Kindle will also fit inside my bulky and very padded Timbuk2 case for traveling.  The Marware case would be perfect for tossing in your purse of pocket.  And I love the pink color!

B005ELZKWS|5.0|I notice there seems to still be this competition with some VH fans that won't die and never will so I thought I would put my two cents worth in here.I love the new Van Halen record ADKOT but that does not mean I am suppose to dislike this record like some people have decided, they are both great! I do favor the new VH more but that's not to say this is not an excellent record IT IS! I was and still am a fan of VH with DLR and Hagar and now Chickenfoot as well it's nice to have this much good RnR these days we should all feel blessed we do! By the way for young ones still learning Sammys music check out his fantastic solo record Standing Hampton.

In all honesty, Vengeance just doesn't feel the same. I can see why they had to get Liam, since Andy died, but they replaced Lesley-Ann Brandt (Naevia) and it just isn't the same.<br /><br />Trying to give Liam a chance so we'll see... not liking the new Naevia. But it's only up to the 3rd episode right now so I'm hopeful....

B005VPRET4|5.0|I bought for my daughter's 7th birthday this week.  She can't put them down.  She has had other Lego sets - some of the city sets - that didn't get played with very frequently. She had absolutely no interest in the Star Wars and other more violent oriented sets.  Because this one has multiple people and is oriented toward more role-play, it appeals to her much more. It's nice to see that Lego finally figured out that they've been ignoring about half of their potential market (girls) and are now doing something to appeal to them. It's nice that the little people have hair and clothes that can be switched out.
1594744769|3.0|Not an especially bad book or good one. It took me a longish time to finish because the plot moved slowly and self-consciously.  It is an interesting coming of age story with a healthy dose of mystery and sadness so I don't feel it was a waste of time. Ransom Briggs does a good job of developing atmosphere and sympathetic characters. A sequel is planned which is a good thing if Briggs can learn to increase the pace and suspense in his storytelling.  There is a prospect of Tim Burton making a movie based on Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. I think that sounds like an excellent pairing for a novel that should be improved with imaginative visuals.

He is one of the most talented living musicians, and he has written and performed songs which will last through lifetimes. However, just because I think he's wonderful doesn't mean that he never makes a mistake. This album, KISSES ON THE BOTTOM, is a sad mistake.  Why? Two important reasons. The first is that his voice is just not up to it. He sings in a high register that makes his vocals sound weak, and exposes the aging that all singers experience after many years. Not all of the songs are affected by this; \\"Ac-Cent-Tu-Ate The Positive\\" and \\"My Valentine\\" find him lower in his range, and stronger. The remainder, however, sound feeble in comparison. It's sad to hear the man who belted out \\"Long Tall Sally\\" and who crooned \\"Yesterday\\" reduced to this.  Second, the backing is anemic. I don't know if all of Ms. Krall's work sounds like this, but it completely lacks energy. It's as if the musicians are playing in their sleep. You can sing slow songs and still have energy. These arrangements, however, are dull and soporific.  I won't say the album has no pleasures. As I mentioned above, \\"My Valentine\\" is gorgeous, well sung and with a beautiful piano backing. It could fit in well on one of Paul's original records. \\"My Very Good Friend The Milkman\\" is amusing and whimsical, but as someone pointed out, Clapton's version has a lot more excitement. Although I liked the opening \\"I'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Write Myself A Letter\\", I could actually imagine a much better version performed by Paul and his band with guitars and drums, not unlike his two rock oldies albums. Paul's strength does not lie in this genre. At least, not on the evidence here.  (For those who own the deluxe edition, just compare the strength of Paul's original take on his own \\"Baby's Request\\" from Wings' BACK TO THE EGG as compared to this new remake. The 1979 version has more energy and a better vocal.)  Finally, before protestors claims that I don't like it because I'm not a jazz fan, let me counter by saying that I own TAKE FIVE, KIND OF BLUE, GIANT STEPS and A LOVE SUPREME, among others. Those are classic jazz albums. This is not.  Please, Paul, go back to your strengths. Give us another rock/pop album, or more from the Fireman.
B004LROMSO|2.0|I watched the pilot (\\"Homecoming\\") online, and was intrigued enough to buy the series on DVD. Mistake! This is--as many others have said--a dumbed-down, soft-porny, politically-correct version of the epic tale. Added to all that is the fact that the ultimate villain(ess) turns out to be...a nun! And a mother superior at that! I mean, c'mon, Hollywood...has Christianity-bashing come down to this?!? That the only cleric we meet in the entire realm of Arthurian Britain is a nun who's sold her soul (for reasons that are never made very clear) to the Dark One? Silly and stupid, really.<br /><br />Now if Hollywood really wanted to put on a clever re-imagining--and get some sword-and-sandal tie-in as well--they could have adapted Jack Whyte's brilliant Camulod Chronicles--[[ASIN:0765303728 The Skystone (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 1)]] and its various sequels.<br /><br />I'd give no stars for most of the series. Eva Green (Morgan Le Fay) and Ralph Fiennes (Merlin) get a half-star apiece for their acting: Claire Forlani (Ygraine) gets a full star for her acting, as both the dowager queen and as...another role, which I can't reveal without spoiling.

B004SBQALA|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. There was enough action to keep entertained and enough supernatural events incorporated for it to remain interesting. It is a bit refreshing to see a movie that is not based on a book, cartoon, television show, is a remake, comes out in 3D, is a prequel or a sequel - unless of course this falls into one of these categories and I just do not know it :o)
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Well, there he goes again!! I've never been a fan of songs from this era, but Paul is making me one. You know, I was skeptical about this project when I first heard about it, but less than a minute of listening put me at ease with his decision to do an album of standards. I read reviews that basically said that this was out of his range, but I disagree. He has taken these songs from fine songwriters from the past, and made them his own. I just wish he could get the radio time the likes of Rod Stewart got, but I sincerely doubt it. They are of the mentality that if it's not another Hey Jude, it's not good enough to put on. Kudos Paul, please keep the good work coming. We are listening!!!

B000V1Z8KK|3.0|The movie revolves around a retired marksman who is seduced into a role that will supposedly prevent the assassination of a sitting President. The film, a political thriller of sorts, stars Mark Wahlberg, who is in rare form here--a string of scenes, which I'm sure took weeks to film, has him displaying a labored kind of breathing following a failed attempt on his life. Walhberg, having been shot twice, is seen hobbling about in dire pain, wincing and breathing in short, quick breaths, and this his character does over the course of an evening, night, and following morning. The consistency in this portrayal was highly convincing. The antithesis of this performance has to come from Danny Glover, who, for the first half of the film is speaking in a seeming whisper that attempts to recall a raspy tough-guy act from ages past, but comes across as woefully inadequate. He only keeps it up, as I said, for half of the film, then abandons the voice for his usual speech tones and patterns.<br /><br />The movie's plot itself, which begins well enough, soon plunges into a pool of absurdity, so much so that an FBI agent, fresh out of the academy (this doesn't stop him from having unbelievably keen instincts that would more befit a veteran fed), is seen running around alongside Walhberg's character as his new \\"spotter\\", while Walhberg is shooting at bad guys and blowing things up with great relish. What I did love about the film, however, besides Walhberg's performance (his best being his roles in The Departed and The Fighter) are the portions of dialogue that Walhberg's character dispenses, the ones that have him talking shop, and doling out marksman lingo like Senators dole out political rhetoric.<br /><br />I was disappointed with everything else in this film, particularly the ending, and the direction the film took when the conflict began to take shape in the Second Act.

0811870413|5.0|I have to think that whoever is rating this book low is not following the instructions.<br /><br />This book is not for the impatient cook. It took me 3-4 weeks just to get a good starter going, and a couple of batches of bread to get it just right (but even the first batch was the best bread i'd ever baked).<br /><br />It's a half day day commitment though the active time can't be more than 45 mins in total. You have to go back and turn the dough at intervals, especially in the first 4 hours, after that, the second rise goes without interference (french country bread). Ideal for saturdays at home. And boy is it worth making. I live in NYC and this bread i am making rivals all the fantastic bakeries in the city.<br /><br />The instructions look overwhelming at first, to baking novices, like i am, but after the first batch, the process is laughably easy, and the second time around you hardly need the book.<br /><br />Honestly one can just get to that first (iconic) country french bread recipe, and never needs to go further! (i add a little extra salt to be fair ;-) )<br /><br />None of my friends believed i was making this bread myself until they actually saw me doing it. It's THAT good.<br /><br />This book has revolutionized my bread baking. Sensational. oh, and it's also outright beautifully made, written, and photographed.

B004X6PRO6|5.0|I read a review about the book in my local paper book review section and thought &#34;Eh.&#34; But then I saw an interview in PBS with the author and was like &#34;Wow!!!&#34; I looked it up on Amazon for people reviews and then found it on my Kindle and started reading it that night. I could not stop - who'da thunk a book about North Korea would be intersting??! I look foward to the authors next book about a country I've never been to and a culture I know next to nothing about.
B005DOL0R0|3.0|The Kindle Fire itself is like a smooth, fat, shiny black brick. The colors on the Fire's screen are nice, but its ergonomics leave something to be desired. So it needs a case to help it out. This case is not for that. Don't get me wrong. It's perfectly serviceable, if drab. The outer shell is tough and the inner lining is padded (as is mandatory for the black brick - don't dare drop it outside of its case - it's a goner). One needs a case that is as tough as this one seems to be, but that helps hold the Fire. Holding it in one's hand is not fun. So, this case is OK - as far as it goes.
B006DHAT5K|2.0|I floated between giving this 1 or 2 stars. I think at least .5 of a star came from Chris Evans, who is just delicious at all times. Honestly though, I really didn't like this movie. Anna can either be cute or really awkward and abrasive, and she fell into the latter alot of this movie. If the movie would have pushed the comedy harder (or maybe they thought they did :/), it would have turned out better, because Anna does better when she's being goofier. When you have a premise such as how many people you've had sex with, you kind of just have to go for it, and this movie kind of made it uncomfortable to watch when it didn't have to be.  Some of the meant to be comedic moments (i.e. the wannabe senator asking her to be the straight wife to him as a gay husband, and Jole Hale smelling his fingers *gag*) were just downright sad. The only thing likeable was Chris and his arc, which they managed to do pretty well. The time was also way too long; the version I watched clocked in at 1:45, way too long for a movie like this.  If you like romcoms and/or raunchy gal humor..don't even bother trying this to see if you like it unless you just want to stare at Chris. My library copy didn't work, so I spent $.74 at Redbox, and that was a bit too much for this, lol. This is more like a 1.5 star vs a 2, but I don't feel utter total hate, so we'll go with 2.

B004N70MH2|4.0|Marcus Lutrell is a Texas-boy through and through. Texans are a unique breed. Often arrogant and self-confident, yet warm and generous, Lutrell fits the bill. \\"Don't mess with Texas!\\"  On June 28, 2005, Lutrell and SEAL Team 10 are sent on a mission into Afghanistan as part of Operation Redwing. SEAL Team 10 consisted of Lutrell, Matthew Axelson, Michael Murphy and Danny Dietz.  The SEALs moved through the Hindu Kush mountains, eventually positioning themselves to watch the village where their target was supposed to be located. While on surveillance, they are surrounded by the Taliban and engaged in a firefight. Over the next few hours the team is outnumbered probably 35 to 1, caught in a vicious firefight, wounded and pushed further and further down the mountain. There are great moments of heroism and bravery as one-by-one they are picked off. In the end, only Lutrell is still alive and on the run with the Taliban chasing him through the mountains.  Eventually he is found and taken in by a Pashtun tribe, and carried to their village where his wounds are treated and he is cared for. The tribe extend their hospitality to him, and they are bound to protect and care for him to the death. This pits them against the Taliban in securing the safety of Lutrell, and in their determination to return him to the Americans. Eventually they do just that.  The writing style was a little too relaxed for me. It was like I was sitting in a bar and listening to him talk over a beer. It was a little scattered and lacked very much structure. Additionally there is so much arrogance in the beginning that it could be a bit of a turnoff. But eventually I got used to the writing style and began to see the arrogance more as \\"confidence\\", and by the middle of the book I'd hit my groove.  However the one thing that kept bothering me was the continual derogatory attitude towards \\"liberals\\". I know Texans are staunchly conservative, but it would have been nice to see a little less bias and derogatory tone. It is quite evident that the author views liberals an enemy nearly paramount to the Taliban.  The details of the firefight are brutal. These guys were shot repeatedly, with serious head, neck, back and stomach wounds, sometimes mortally shot, and they kept going. They kept fighting- for themselves, for their buddies, for their mission and their country.  The one thing that I missed in this book was the chance to really get to know these guys that died out on that mountain. However that didn't stop me from crying as I read of their bravery in the face of terror and pain.  There is a fair amount of vulgarity throughout this book. After all, there is a reason we refer to people as \\"talking like a sailor\\"!  Overall I would recommend this story-- for the middle. The beginning is a little too arrogant and brash, like a boy boasting of his conquests. The end a little too quiet as he recuperates and tours the US to visit with the family members of those who died in Operation Redwing. The middle, the heart of the story, is heart-wrenching and brutal and will have you in tears as you read what these boys went through and what they did for one another. Their love for one another is evident. Beautiful.  If you are intrigued by the Navy SEALs, if you don't shy away from brutality, if you can take the vulgarity and brashness, pick this one up. It will move you.
B000SEJHRA|1.0|I saw this book listed on a bunch of people's \\"funniest books I've ever read\\" lists. I didn't enjoy it at all. The stories were boring and uneventful. I only finished it because I felt obligated after spending $10 on it for my kindle.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Look no further... If you are a Star Wars saga lover, you gotta have this.<br />The box itself is a collectors memorabilia.<br />The Extras Blu-rays have very interesting documentaries about the movies.<br />I totally recommend this purchase.

014241722X|2.0|Wow -- I'd been hearing about John Grisham all my life and though his writing style isn't exactly what I look for when I go to reach for a book (I'm a non-fiction buff), I figured that my kids were in good hands with such a well known and experienced author. I read this book with them over the period of a week or two and wow, were we amazed at how bad it was. It started out promising, with the a murder mystery to solve and a thirteen year old who fancies himself a \\"lawyer\\" -- but frankly you could have done a better job with this book by taking paper cut-outs and pasting them to the pages of the book. As the story went on it went quickly down hill. First, the tone is heavy and didactic. Second, the characters are ridiculous. Theodore Boone is the \\"hero\\" -- somehow he never needs to attend school and when he does manage to show up, he's being solicited for legal advice from friends, schoolmates, teachers and the school secretary. He always knows the answer. Always gets the goods. Yet, somehow, the story manages to remain static throughout. We find out about a third of the way through the story how the murder occurred and who the likely murderer is and after that -- the story never changes. It just plods along with more and more improbable and annoying scenes in which Theodore Boone, kid lawyer comes to the rescue. By the end of the book, the only sympathetic character is his Uncle Ike, the pastry eating, baseball cap wearing black sheep of the family -- the rest of them are an irritating bunch of lawyerly types who aren't worth the time it takes to read about their stereotypical lives. We started out enthused and by the end of the book, as we finally hit the halfway point and started the ride downhill, found ourselves in a free for all as we hurtled toward the end -- all of us cheering for the fact that the book would soon be over. Even my kids were making fun of Theodore Boone and the starched, artificial language and unbelievable circumstances that led the reader through one of the sorriest kids novels we've seen in a long time. I bought the book because one of my kids has a deep desire to study law, but even he thought the tone and characterizations in the book were absolutely leaden. Don't waste your time with this one. You'd have more fun hiring a lawyer.

B000FC1192|5.0|Coraline is like a dream that twists around into a nightmare, without you being able to figure out just where everything went wrong. Aside from Coraline, most of the characters are flat and odd, like marionettes that someone else is playing... but it works. Coraline breaks down the barrier between what things look like and what they are. It's one of the scariest books I've ever read, but not for violence... just the horrible, lingering creeps that crawl right up your back!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Looking for something to keep the Kindle safe, something that wouldn't get in the way or be bulky to handle, and something with a stand.  This cover is all of those things.  Bought it in black; I do wish they offered more color choices (like red!) but really it's just perfect.  It's very much like the iPad cover.  It snaps onto the Kindle very securely and I am very comfortable carrying it in my purse and not worrying about scratches.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Book was well written and hard to put down.  Even with working full-time and taking care of four kids, I still managed to finish the book in less than a week; lost a little sleep over it, but it was worth it ;-)  I would recommend this book to others for sure...now, it's time to start on the second book in the trilogy!
B00008WT5C|5.0|The tracks on this cd are based on the American vinyl release of this album from 1977 they took off Crabsody In Blue and added Problem Child from their previous album Dirty Deeds because no other AC/DC album had been relased in the States yet. So if you by this version of the album and buy Dirty Deeds you've got 2 versions of Problem Child. The way to avoid this is to buy the Australian import version of Let There Be Rock which has the orignal black & white cover based on the Australian original vinyl version of Let There Be Rock.
B003FSTN7A|5.0|It was a pleasure to receive this season and the final season for the series as a gift for the holidays from my husband, who, of course, watched them with me. The characters are delightful, the plots varied, the acting adequate.  It is unfortunate the series is no longer on TV, but we enjoy all 7 seasons of DVD's.  Recommend this for people who like to explore a slightly different universe.

B0071MQBX0|4.0|I'm used to adapting to my world, and not having my world adapt to me but I felt a little ambushed by this movie. I'm a long time fan of Phantom, so I knew the key points to expect trouble for my photosensitive epilepsy. The problem in this case was that the lighting effects in this version tended heavily toward strobe - even at points I wasn't expecting. I streamed the movie as a rental, so I just dropped the movie at the key points. However, I found myself rapidly spinning myself out and around or slamming on minimize at multiple other points completely out of the blue. That meant I was missing entire sections (although I at least got to hear them.) One would think with the recent news stories about seizures and movies people would begin to think things through. I guess it's just going to take some time.

B005UT29Z0|5.0|This film was so perfectly executed I am shocked it hasn't received more attention.  Its basically the human story of corporate culture and its values, but don't expect this to be cut in dry lambasting of wall street investment firms and those who work for them, no. This film throws out the rhetoric and hands you human beings you either love or hate but cannot help but understand their position even if you cannot empathize with it; human, oh so human Nietzsche once wrote.  There are aspects of this film that were obviously lifted from the documentary Inside Job which details exactly what happened in 2008 during the financial meltdown.  Instead of blaming all of the woes on corporations this film extends itself so that we all as a culture are culpable in the values which lead to the collapse.  It also plays the tune no one really wants to highlight which is that most of these companies didn't have any choice, the game was over anyway.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about reading this book first, I don't know if it was the fairytale remake or the cyborg part, but if you are having any of those reservation DON'T. This was one of those books I had a hard time putting down. The author does such an amazing job capturing your attention that before you know it your reading the last lines and your mind is blown away by an unexpected ending. I absolutely cannot wait for the next book that follows!
B004ULNJIU|3.0|To start with I have to say that Jason Statham is one of my favorites; so I may be a little kinder than I should be for this UK movie. It starts off with a nice butt whipping so it caught my attention. The rest of the movie runs a bit slow and has a lot of character building. There is a good amount of cold blooded murder, ass whipping and a killer you may call barely believable but passable for the limited imagination this movie has. I do admit I did like the ending even though you can see it coming a (Kilometer) away.<br />It is worth a watch in my opinion.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|I've been a fan of Leonard Cohen's since I was a kid listening to my mom's old records.  I feel such a sense of pride with the release of this album that I haven't felt in a long time.  Cohen is a beautiful mystic and knows a little more about truth than the next guy.  You can hear this in his voice.  You won't regret it.

B004B8RXQQ|5.0|In this third show of the first season, Holmes has to match wits with a malevolent mind who provides links to crimes that Holmes has to solve by a deadline or another innocent will be murdered.  Holmes mental dexterity is on display, the cat and mouse tension heightens the drama, and the season ends with you wondering.  Can't wait for Season 2.  My brother is visiting--he tends to like car chases--and he fell in love with this cerebral, edgy show as I have.
B004132I4S|5.0|Each Sufjan album is different, evoking an individual mood and emotional response.  This CD, along with his catalogue as a whole, just cements his place as a modern-day musical genius.  Buy any of his albums to start and you can't go wrong.  If you already know him, then be pleased that he still strives to grow and try new approaches to express his musical vision.
0385534639|4.0|Wonderfull debut; full of magical, transcendent imagery. I really wouldn't call it magical realism like Alice hoffman's books or Gabriel Garcia Marquez because this was infused with pure magic, like a grownup Harry potter. Readers who enjoyed this should try \\"Veronica\\" by Nicholas Christopher. Same theme about dueling magicians and a lot of Asian/Tibetan mysticism and just as heavy with atmosphere. As I read \\"the night circus,\\" I kept wondering if the author had actually read \\"Veronica\\" because it could have easily inspired this novel. Both stand on their own though. Looking forward to more from this author.
0141327677|5.0|My son has always been a very reluctant writer, so when my mom gave him this book as a birthday present, I didn't expect much gratitude.  Much to my surprise, he spent weeks avidly filling in pages upon pages of writing.  It was creative, funny, and best of all, he LOVED it!  Now he's begging for me to find other books like it.  This book simply blew me away, and I can't tell you what a pleasure it's been for my son to actually enjoy writing for once.
B006UG90RM|5.0|This is a great album!  If you are a true Van Halen fan and enjoy the days with Roth the best then you will enjoy this album.  It's fresh!  It's fast!  It will have you moving in your seat behind the steering wheel!  I absolutely love it.  While I do agree that the sound is a little bit different without Michael Anthony, it's still totally Van Halen and it still totally rocks!!!!  My favorites on the album are Blood and Fire, Bullethead, The Trouble with Never, Stay Frosty, and Big River.  Actually, I think it's a toss up between Blood and Fire and Big River as my favorite song on the album.  Stay Frosty is not far behind.  The songs are not forgettable (like one of the reviewers stated) and it may have even convinced me to spend the money and go see the show!  So, what are you waiting for?  Click the buy button or (Amazon may not like this) get in your car and go buy the actual CD like we all did in the days of old!  I really don't think you will be disappointed.
0385523912|5.0|Having just finished this book I rate it among the best I have read. Since I had been in South Korea in the Army in the late 50's with Army Intelligence I was able to look back at how South Korea has so rapidly developed and how North Korea has gone nowhere on the backs of it's citizens. Barbara Demick does a masterful job of  relating the stories of those who actually lived the horrors of life in such a repressive country and the aftermath and realities of what happened to them upon defecting. It's one of those books that was difficult to put down each time I turned the light off at the end of the day. I was always looking forward to continuing the read. This book should be required reading somewhere in our educational system.

0618154248|5.0|Bought it for a 1-year old who likes to hold it in her hand and wave it around and casually chew on it.  Her 4-year old sister likes the ease of turning the pages and claims George is her favorite.  Then she proceeds to \\"read\\" aloud to the younger one by describing what she sees. Purchase is a success!
B006YXTRHY|5.0|Breaking Dawn pt.1 has done justice to the novel in my opinion. The cinematography is beautiful and the special effects were beyond my expectations. It's not so much a cheesy romantic film than an action-packed drama. Ignore the haters and give this one a chance, you might be surprised.
B004WR125O|3.0|My wireless router provides great coverage throughout my house for web browsing, etc. but this Onkyo adapter can't access a strong enough signal to work in this environment.  I can stream video on a laptop, I can't even stream audio with this adapter in the same location.<br /><br />The only upside is the installation process is very simple.<br /><br />I would return the item, but it is more trouble than it is worth.<br /><br />My next try is the TP-link adapter that has better range and the same guts as this thing (so it is compatible).<br /><br />If that doesn't work, it is on to power line ethernet I guess.<br /><br />3/4/12 update--With a TP-link adapter on its way to me via Newegg/DHL, I tried firing up the Onkyo USB dongle one last time-----and this time it worked.  I did nothing different this time than the 20 or so times I tried previously, before writing this review, but now I can get internet radio with good quality from the same 65% signal that didn't work before.  I would be willing to bet that the cheaper TP-link adapter is a better purchase, however.  I upped my star rating to 3, where it will stay if this is reliable for a good long time.  At least consider the TP-link adapter, which is cheaper and reviewers say has a stronger antenna, before you purchase this.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|This is one of those books that took a while for me to get into, but once I did, I could not put it down.  I did not realize how really good it was until I got to the end and began to think of the interweaving of characters and events.  I actually did cry while reading this book.  I finished the book about a year ago and still think about the different stories from time to time now.  The writing was excellent and the episodic nature was riveting.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to learn about human nature.
0767819659|5.0|We were delighted to find the dvd on Amazon.  There was a little girl who really wanted to send it to her hospitalized friend as a gift.  The vendor did a great job of shipping in a timely manner.  The product was new, as described.
0143118706|1.0|This was supposed to be about her marriage to her Bali lover.  While she does drop his name from time to time it is a very long disertation of rambling thoughts on marriage that mostly are quotes from other author's...and her lack of carrying about another person and her decision not to have children (Thank God on that one!)  She mentions prayer/praying a lot but it seems more likely she is muslim or a follower of Buddha or can't decided what she wants to be.  This book seems more like her shot at endorsing gay marriage and putting down marriage in general.  She will never love anyone or anything as much as she loves to hear herself talk! She talks endlessly about her high education and bank account and her own low moral standards of years gone by.  I hope that is not her picture on the back cover.  She says she is 36 or so but the picture looks like a worn out housewife of fifty something -- only thing missing is the apron of the forty's & fifties. Time for a visit to the beauty spa and learning how to apply makeup...a new wardrobe is waaaaaay overdue!  The last two segments of Eat Pray Love were in the same \\"look at me\\" vanity psychie.
B005UKJX4E|5.0|I stand confidently in the \\"I loved it\\" side of the room on \\"The Tree of Life.\\"<br /><br />The cinematography by Emmanual Lubezski is spectacular.  I'll agree with someone else who commented that you could hit pause at any moment in \\"The Tree of Life\\" and you'd have an image worthy of framing.  But I loved the movement of the camera which seemed to go from one extraordinary angle to another throughout nearly every scene.  There was more than one love affair going on in this film.  Perhaps the cinematographers love of morning light was one of the most powerful.<br /><br />Jessica Chastain was magnificent.  This film gives the viewer every opportunity to relate to one or more of the characters for whatever reasons appeal to them an a personal, emotional basis.  I related to the young man and his struggles with identity.  But if I shed a tear at the end, it was because of how badly I miss my own mother, who for me, was so gracefully portrayed by Ms. Chastain.  Chastain's performance is the reason this movie reached my heart, and why I was so willing to embrace all its fundamental ambiguity with curiosity and enthusiasm.<br /><br />In the movie, Jessica Chastain's performance was challenged by the relative lack of audio recording. So many of the scenes were filmed in a way where the ephemeral methods employed by the director and cinematographer meant that there would be no dialogue.  It seemed to me in these scenes Ms. Chastain was the most brilliant.<br /><br />I might have changed the balance a little bit - less dinosaur, astrophysics and young male acting out, with a little bit more development of the other two brothers, of Mom's reality, and of the older brother (Penn) later in his life.  However, given that the story has its roots in the biblical story of Job, I thought it was somewhat clever (smile) that the screenplay has so much \\"pre-\\" historic scenes that were decidedly un-creationist!  Perhaps in exchange for some dinosaur action, in keeping with the grace of this film, more footage of ancient rainforest (rain), savannah (wind), or desert (heat) would have been nice to reinforce the \\"grace\\" of \\"nature.\\" Anyway, I wonder if the evolutionary implications of some of the prehistoric scenes is why so many people, many who have never written reviews before, have logged into Amazon to write as many one or two sentence one star reviews as possible, and/or do as much damage as possible to the positive reviews for \\"The Tree of Life.\\"  Were they offended on a religious level?  Was the mysterious crystalline light in the background of some of the dark screens not enough divine symbolism?<br /><br />We are our memories.  My perfect genetic clone is not me because he has none of my memories.  I completely enjoyed the way Malick portrayal memory in \\"The Tree of Life.\\"  Short clips.  Varying amounts of sound.  Unconventional perspectives.  Varying speed.  All kinds of light - in this movie light is used like an artists tool, whether it is brilliant morning light, fire, candles, interior filtered light, etc. Many of the scenes have no sound.  I can only imagine the amount of work that went into the preparations for shooting for the all the individual scenes.<br /><br />Right now I am thinking about Mrs. O'Brien with her son at a river.  They have their backs to us and there is a light evening breeze.  They are sheltering something with a bright fire light in their hands.  There are extraordinary moments in my life that I recall like this.  Others have criticized Malick's art.  I totally embrace it and look forward to tracking down more of it.<br /><br />I have one question I would ask Mr Malick if I could: it seems so many of the artists who contributed to this film (actors, camera, scenery, animation and special effects included) contributed their art in a way that was entirely consistent with the overall theme and character of the movie.  I wonder how much of this is Malick's heavy directing hand, and how much of this was the artists who embraced the theme free to explore their art under the general light touch of Malick.  In any event, the collection of artists added so much to the overall richness of the end product.  A wonderful example of this is the music by Alexandre Desplat. I am a great fan of rich, emotional and melancholy music that is powerful yet does not force the listener toward a specific conclusion because of its modest ambiguity.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, \\"The Tree of Life\\" stands out for me as a very important and worthy film because of its entirely unconventional and effective approach to the visual art of story telling.ho embraced the theme free to explore their art under the general light touch of Malick.

B004ZNARH4|5.0|Sound quality across the board is very,very good. The videos are the weakest sound link here, but given their age, better than I've seen. The live show is better than my bootleg copy of it, however it should have been the complete show.  Yes the packaging is..not well thought out, so while your at amazon, or you favorite local music store, pick up 2 or 3 double jewel boxes.  The extras, better than nothing, the books are nice, good color,very sharp. The scarf I drapped over one speaker, and when I get the WYWH set I'll do the same to the other. The marbles I thumb gummed (blue swishy playdoh type stuff ) to the base plate of my TV. The coasters...I tossed in a drawer..I may get them lamanated so they could be used as a coaster, but I doubt it. I have a mancave so the wife couldn't care less what I decorate it with, pretty common themes...Star Wars, Music, Green Bay Packers.  One thing that bothered me was the missing posters and stickers from the vinyl...seems odd not to have them included.  Now that the price has dropped I didn't feel ripped off at all....now the waiting for WYWH to get sub $70.

1594203334|4.0|As a new parent, I found the French parenting philosophies in this book very intriguing. I totally agreed with the author's viewpoint on many American children - they are impatient, have no tolerance for diverse(and healthy)foods, and the parent's desire to force their children to reach developmental milestones, robbing them of their childhood. My greatest fear as a new parent is having a child who will only eat bland or sugary food, who throws temper tantrums the moment their need is not met. This book offered a different perspective on how all children don't have to be like that - it is possible to raise polite children by employing this French philosophy. While many ideas in this book are common sense, I think a lot of parents in the US could benefit from reading this book as a gentle reminder that you shouldn't be your child's best friend, that children should be allowed to learn at their own pace, and they could eat more than chicken nuggets and potato chips.

0465011047|5.0|When I tell people about this story I always emphasize that it is true -  I didn't make it up. A story of how an entire family endured unspeakable horrors contrived by men who were (and still are) mad. This is not written by just a third party but by a family member who lived it. His story actually received the attention of the White House where he was invited for an interview. I think it's natural to become complacent about conditions or things when they are not in our everyday consciousness. This story can jolt the reader and serve as a reminder of what was and still exists in a country on the other side of the world from our comfort zones.

B000AARKOO|2.0|I loved all the \\"epic grandeur\\" of the movie, but if you are going to make a war movie, make the sides seem more even, or have some kind of complexity or even moral ambiguity to them both. This isn't some kind of children's book, this is an enormous production and worthy of more thought! Instead, the Christians, particularly clergy, are portrayed as sadistic, murderous, pitiless, even cowardly goons, and the Muslims as Wise Men of the East. Either the movie's makers were afraid of a Muslim terror cell targeting them, or they wanted to sell the movie in Islamic countries (and I think they were able to do so, by the way) but one way or another, the characterization of the two sides is terribly unbalanced, and so far from any realistic conception of the contemporary reality for the time period that this film with amazing special effects loses its ability to make us suspend our disbelief or really get into the action at all. It is alright to have some corrupt priests and so on, but to have every priest and Templar knight some kind of murderous idiot, and the Bishop of Jerusalem a coward who is ready to convert to Islam out of fear, and the hero of the story becoming an atheist - it is just too much! In the Middle Ages, in a CRUSADER STATE, is there going to be this level of lack of faith and atheism??? Absolutely NO WAY! Completely unbelievable! If they portrayed the Crusaders in the light of their own culture and mindset, and the Muslims in their real contemporary mindset of JIHAD, we could sit back and be dazzled by that time's fascinating clash of religions and cultures, and by its exotic motivations, which, since they are quite different from those of the modern West, would intrigue us. Instead, we are treated to a long anti-Christian bigoted rant. Was there not one priest who was principled then? Is there nothing at all noble about that time's Christians to impress us with on the screen? Were all Muslims such humane and philosophical wizards? Were the Crusades really any more morally repugnant than the many Jihads which lay waste to so many countries and kept our own Western culture suppressed for over a thousand years??? This movie will in no way become \\"THE\\" movie of the Crusades. Someone else will be able to come along later and tell a much more interesting and believable story, using REAL motives for that time period's characters, and do it without such an enormous heap of anti-Christian bigotry. Until then, though, I guess this movie will have to stand in for it - \\"sigh.\\"
0062082353|5.0|I ordered this book for my son who has become a fan of shooting from paintball to rifles to pistols.  He didn't put this book down until he was done and already has another to start (another book recommended by the author of this book).

B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a good game, but the game isn't clear on my kindle fire screen its kinda fussy, but kinda if your bored.
0767803434|3.0|... whether you view it as a serious film or a comedy. As a serious film, one star. As a comedy, 5. For me, it's definitely a comedy.<br /><br />See the President of the United States engaging in mortal, hand-to-hand combat with armed terrorists! Sure, he's clearly in his fifties, and going up against young, strong, trained combatants; but he's a Fighting President! And nobody, but nobody, is going to take over his plane! (He makes it clear at one point that it's \\"my plane!\\". Funny, I thought the plane, and the White House, etc., belonged to the people. Guess that's an outdated concept).<br /><br />Meanwhile, watch the determined Vice President get off the helicopter (not sure why she was flying around in it in the first place) and whirl into action, issuing orders and taking command of the situation. Because she's a Fighting Vice President! Oh, we have a minute or two of the obligatory scene where she and the Secretary of Defense argue about who is in charge, but that's just for show. In the next scene, the Fighting Vice President is still running the show. And doing so brilliantly! Because she's not a figurehead VP, as most are; no, it's made clear that she and the president are good friends and close partners (yep -- that's realistic). Also, she looks exactly like George Washington, so she has that added gravitas. (Don't know what I'm talking about? Go to google images and enter \\"glenn close air force one\\". Find the picture where she's standing in front of the \\"White House\\" logo in the press room. Put it next to the image of Washington from a dollar bill. Compare the hair, the eyes, the nose, the lips. They could be twins).<br /><br />To fully appreciate the absurdity of this movie, imagine it with our real president and veep. Look, I'll be non-partisan about it -- imagine either Obama or Bush in hand-to-hand combat with armed terrorists and killing them. My own choice would be Clinton and Gore, who were in office when the movie was made. I think \\"Air Force One\\"is a great comedy; but if someone would use CGI to replace Harrison Ford and Glenn Close with computer-generated Bill Clinton and Al Gore, and dub their voices in -- well, that would be, by far, the greatest comedy film of all time.

B004U52VPS|5.0|My boys love playing Angry Birds on the phones/Ipad so when I stumbled on this, I had to get it. We've had a lot of fun playing this game as a family!
0525478817|5.0|I don't know what more I can add to the fabulous 5 star reviews here, but I will try.  I was a bit put off thinking this was a \\"Young Adult\\" novel.  I was not at all interested in the Twilight or Hunger Games series, both of which earned enormous critical acclaim.  I was reluctant to purchase this thinking it would be another novel which was widely adored-but not for me.  I was so wrong.  While the characters, Hazel and Augustus are teens, they are far more mature than their years, in part due to their long term illnesses.  The discourse in this book is sublime.  The author really had me repeating lines in my head and writing them down in a journal because they were so meaningful.  It is really difficult to write a novel about suffering and death without being maudlin, over the top, or flat out depressing.  Somehow, John Green accomplishes the impossible by making this novel more about love, laughter, family, friends rather than the pain that each person in the novel experiences.  This is a truly remarkable feat....and a book which should be cherished for a long, long time.

B002RSDW80|5.0|A conductor stands poised, baton at the ready, before his orchestra. A surgeon takes that steadying breath, scalpel in hand. A teacher stands before a class of eager, boisterous behavior under control. What marvels will unfold in each scenario?<br /><br />It's that beginning, that initial moment, knowing--in advance--the great effort of the task to come, that leads \\"Julie and Julia\\" to fruition. And, oh, that opening moment, that promise of richness of story, can lead only to great satisfaction or disappointment. \\"Julie and Julia\\" did it for me! This is a movie to love! I have gone on and on to family and friends about how much I love this movie!<br /><br />Where to begin? Obviously, Meryl Streep as Julia Child should not have received a penny for her acting--she too much enjoyed getting into that role, giving the viewer a truly great performance. Julia Child loved life! Everywhere she went, with everyone she met, with every experience, she brought herself, bigger than life, and oh, so much fun! Meryl Streep gives us a portrait of that woman. It's an amazing performance!<br /><br />Julie Powell conceived of the perfect idea for a book: Cook Julia Childs! No, not literally. Julie cooked her way through Julia Childs' magnus opus: \\"French Cooking\\" written for American women who wanted to explore the cooking techniques of the French chef, yet knowing she could never go to cooking school.<br /><br />That takes us to France, her husband, a diplomat, and French cooking. Julia Child was very happily married to Paul Child. In fact, this plain-looking, big-boned woman married at age 49, at which age she had experienced sex exactly zero times. But, according to the movie, oh, how she made up for it, including noon delights. (If this topic seems out of character for Julia Child, you would be wrong--it's quite pertinent!) As for Stanley Tucci, again, he gives a wonderful performance. He is one over-looked actor at awards time!<br /><br />The book is written in alternate stories: that of Julia and the writing of \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" and that of Julie, a young married woman who wanted to distinguish herself as a solid writer. She conceives of a blog in which she details how to cook the French way, following the famous Child methods. Then, we see Julia learning how to cook French and adapting that to her own inimitable style.<br /><br />The film follows Julie's story for the one year it took to prepare all the recipes in the book. Julia's story covers several years and the writing and cooking that make up the book.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this movie. Not only is Meryl Streep excellent, but also Amy Adams as Julie. What poetic license Julie inserts in this a true story is inconsequential: the story remains the same--an accounting of two lives: one who lived joie de vivre, who challenged the status quo, and one who faced obstacles and overcame each one, whether with pluck or defiance or joy.<br /><br />Next reading assignment: the book, that is, both of the books!rt of French Cooking\\" and that of Julie, a young married woman who wanted to distinguish herself as a solid writer.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I rated this five stars because it was exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a light case that wouldn't add bulk to the device, but protected it well, was sleek, and was able to stand it up for watching movies. This case is fantastic. It looks cool and the band, which is similar to one you would find on a moleskin book, is really nice for holding everything together. I was really pleased with this case. If you're looking to throw your device down 8 flights of stairs and expect it to be protected, this may not be the right case for you. I haven't dropped mine at all thankfully, but do feel comfortable that it would withstand a typical fall with this case.

B003H9MSPG|3.0|Kids love this gun and that is probably what matters most but this thing is huge and I think just too big.  Perhaps in the summer it'll be more manageable outdoors but the smaller guns are more popular and easier to use.  All the kids have complained that the shoulder stock doesn't come off as it does with some of the other nerd guns. I think their attempt to make it smaller was thwarted and disappointing.<br /><br />I'd pass on this and get something different if I had to do it again.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it is so awesome. the one thing I don't like about it. is that you have to buy the games
B005XOPEOU|5.0|Great album by a great band.  If you don't know what you are getting by now or who Cold Play is then either try this and enjoy or find some older albums and see what they are about.  I absolutely LOVE this album. I think it actually is my favorite of theirs.
055380684X|3.0|The book was filled with very interesting anecdotes that was written much like Bob Rotella's, \\"Golf is not a Game of Perfect\\". But I would have liked to have seen those anecdotes relate to more specific instructions or recommendations or approach of how to apply deep practice and other aspects of the book.  If greatness is learned, then we need more specifics on how to learn rather than just anecdotes.  But I definitely benefited from the observations of the author and will apply my own interpretation of the data. I'd recommend this to any one.
B0071QIN00|4.0|this is a great game seems to have bugs issues. the rides are not as smooth, making the game play very hard. sometimes the buttons would not register. and they should add a way to drive backwards
B0071QIN00|5.0|this game is awesome. I recommend this game to everyone. this game is all I do when I'm bored and have nothine to do. this is the best dirtnike game ever.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app gives you great reading plans and they even allow you to earn badges! Some crashing here and there, but does not interfere with function overall.
0312330537|2.0|Reminded me a lot of Siddhartha, if Herman Hesse had been an idiot. Okay, kidding aside, I really liked the last 3rd of this book, and some of the characters (Prabakar for one) were great stuff. The main character was pretty much a wash for me- he seemed to suffer from that \\"superman\\" syndrome I see in books alot, where the main character is effortlessly a 1) Multi, multi linguist, 2) knife fighter, 3) writer, 4) philosopher, 5) medical practitioner, and 6) forger. I might be missing some. He also has terrible mood swings. Almost every other chapter ends with his anger \\"peeling away to be lost among the stars\\" only for the next chapter to start with him pissed off for absolutely nothing.  But disregarding the main character, the writing is very nice in many parts(especially the descriptions) and the story is interesting, if rather far fetched. There are some horrible lines in here though. An example, during a lovemaking scene: \\"I was her chariot, and she rode me into the sun.\\" Ugh.  You could tell the author himself loves India, and this gives the book a lot of value, in my eyes. I felt I understood the culture of india more after this book, and I enjoyed reading about life in the villages and slum areas, and the redemption found in those sorts of places.  Worth reading if you like cultural studies, and can ignore some awkward phrasing
B0071QIN00|1.0|this game is so stupid whenever you try to jump over bombs you just land on them its super stupid and it froze my kindle fire
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing solitaire and this game doesn't disappoint. I haven't had any issues with crashing and it is challenging enough that I'm not always winning but also not too easy.
B00377V6J2|5.0|I really enjoy this CD/DVD combo.  I became an instant fan of SRV when I saw an in session performnce with him and Albert King on PBS, and it happens to be the same DVD I ordered -- loving it.
B0071QIN00|2.0|Like the first version of this game, the launch/ jumps ramps are a mess because of the low polygon counts. For instance, a smooth curve requires more than a few curves put together. The more angles the smoother. In this game, because of the Android limitations, there are usually only a couple angles on launch ramps. So when you set up a jump there is a lift (30-45 degrees,) which usually causes you to slow down when your bike hits it, then another ramp at a higher 75-80 degrees at the top. This second ramp instead of being smooth, slows you down even further and causes you to jump straight up frequently. The result of jumping straight up, slowly, is that you fall straight down, slowly. See my pic above for the results of this poor design.<br /><br />The developer tried hard and the graphics look good for an Android game. But the gameplay is flawed and not fun. The point of these games are to make them just challenging enough that they are hard but possible to beat. With the angles and lack of smooth jumps the game is more frustrating than fun. We simply need more polygons.<br /><br />In the meantime, check Xbox Live's Trials HD for this game done right.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|when people said grisly manor needed to be bigger the creators made this. its pretty fun but it might be a little to big

B0070Z97LG|1.0|The movie is well shot, but plot wise is a terrible mess. It doesn't know what it wants to be and has a poorly realized twist. In fact, if you have seen the trailer, you already know the main plot twist.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|This app is just amazing.  I fell asleep within 15 minutes of the first time I used it. I love all of the different sounds, especially rain on a tent. I highly recommend this app.
B005MRXS78|2.0|This pan head is not for serious videographers. It is not solidly built and requires too many (5) AA batteries. Rotation is generally smooth, but is subject to subtle sudden acceleration. The horizontal rotation is only 120 degree. Its light weight and low price may, however, be attractive to some casual users.
B001N1DPDE|3.0|UPDATE:<br />I upgraded my review from 1 star to 3 stars.  It is still true that this is not the knife for normal knife tasks.  Now that I no longer mistake this thing for a normal knife, I can appreciate it for what it is - a small pry bar with a good edge.  it is great at splitting wood,  a terrific throwing knife if you take the handle off.  I take it car camping every time but never carry it anywhere.<br /><br />--------------------------------<br />OLD REVIEW:<br /><br />There is not one normal knife task (cutting meat to eat, peeling a potato, peeling a grapefruit, making a figure 4 trigger, cleaning a fish, ...), in my opinion, that can be performed with this gigantic hunk of steel.  The blade is simply too wide, too thick, and too heavy.<br /><br />Unlike the gerber LMF2, the gerber ultimate knife, and the Kabar USMC knife, it is not weighted well and is not even slightly ergonomic.<br /><br />Although the steel is relatively high quality, and the blade is not serrated (which I prefer), It is so impractical I will never ever carry it anywhere.<br /><br />The only thing this is good for is splitting wood.  And if one is willing to carry 16oz of metal, a swiss army knife with a saw and a smaller survival knife would be a much more practical choice.<br /><br />I am very surprised this has gotten so many great reviews.
B005HSL626|3.0|I like this game but there's a lot of adds : (  also my screen went black while playing then it brought me to twitter.
B004ZN9YNC|5.0|This album is as good as many of their works, and is one of the most underrated albums ever. I think Gilmour plays some of his best and here, and Not Now John is one of Pink Floyd's best songs. Just give it a chance, it will grow on you
B006UG90RM|5.0|'Bout time we got some f&*$king rock n roll at it's hardest thanks to the VH clan - great job guys. You keep this 51 year old still rocking after all these years and i've been a fan since I was 17, many moons ago. \\"If it's too loud you're too old\\" Welcome back Diamond Dave!
B000006TRV|5.0|Many people like Dark Side. They call it Floyd's best album, but that is a lie. The Wall is, and it is one of the greatest works of the 20th century. As many know, it tells the story of Pink and how he built his no-existent wall. The lyrics and music Waters and sometimes Gilmour wrote is phenomenal! The vocals are truly outstanding, Gilmour always shreds his guitar as usual, Rick's piano is electrifying, Mason provides an excellent beat in every song with drums, and Waters has some of his best bass lines. This album is truly outstanding!  10/10
B004QK5N5W|2.0|This thing works fine but videos purchased through iTunes will not play through it to your TV. You will get a message saying \\"Protected movie cannot be played on the connected device.\\"
0307593312|2.0|too long, too repetitive, meandering into a circle without much point. granted there are parts beautifully written. the books lost me half way thru reading it! there are better books to spend time reading than this one.
B005T87QCI|4.0|It is a very fun game especially for real steel fans. I enjoyed it a lot. The graphics could be better.
0439023513|5.0|The first two volumes were outstanding. The third, though, is the best. It elevates the Hunger Games series to something special.  Surprise after surprise, a harsh realism, sharp satire and an understanding that even victory comes at a price. All these and more create a book and a series to be remembered.  This is great storytelling and great fiction. I hope the movie makers don't go the Hollywood route when they get to the final and make a sanitized zipadee doodaw ending that a minority of the reviewers here wanted.<br /><br />Something ought to be said about the audio versions. I read all three books, watched the first movie, then listened to the audio version and in that caught a lot more of the nuances from the work. There are a lot of good performers reading audio books these days, some good, a few not so good. Carolyn McCormick, Dr. Olivette from the Law and Order series, may be the best. She gives a dramatic reading that very much enhances the enjoyment of the novels. I would consider an audiobook on her reading it alone.

B002UZ5CHO|5.0|I kind of don't want to eat.. anything.. anymore.. The movie was an EYE-OPENER. Never again will I eat meat. Or chicken. Or anything else-point is, don't eat because you are what you eat and, as this movie shows, OUR FOOD IS HORRIBLE. Just kidding, sort of. Really though, good movie, well-made, and informative. Do what you will with the information (YOU'LL NEVER EAT AGAIN!!)
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is fun and challenging. I also like that you can change the backgrounds and the card faces. What I dint like is that you can't change the card sequence.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I have not complaints about this product.  The show itself is one of the best on TV, and the special features on the DVDs are interesting and worthwhile.  However, being a blu ray snob, I should have waited for them to come out on blu ray.  At the time I purchased this box set there weren't even blu ray versions set to be released (aside from the 5th Season that hasn't even finished on CBS).  Anyway, unless you care about high definition, this product is great.
B006GH6IS4|5.0|Saw a preview of this documentary on YouTube so I was so excited when they put it on Blu-Ray here in the US.  It's an amazing doc. with lots of interviews and video clips.  Also a bonus section of unseen videos and more interviews.  Great addition to any music fan, and Queen fan's library.

Adele is amazing, she's funny, elegant, chic... she's a DIVA and the quality of the sound wow, and my mind was blown. Great purchase I did.  The only thing I didn't like is that the package does not include the MP3 version.

0783226063|3.0|Dune(released Dec/84),is an overly long and erratic tome that in the end fails to satisfy.It is chock full of stars like Jose Ferrer,Patrick Stewart,Linda Hunt,Kyle Maclachlin,Sting,Max Von Sydow,Dean Stockwell,Sean Young and many,many more,but the sheer immensity of the talent on hand still isn't enough to give this film more than just an average score.The book was first published in 1965 and I recall it was a must read among my buddies.The author wrote five more sequels,none of which this movie attempted to integrate...thank goodness!<br />The plot is a hard one to follow but in general terms it consists of one planet whose surface is mined for the spice melange,called Arrakis.It is highly valuable stuff and when production of it starts to waver,or at least the potential of a slow down is seen,the Emperor Shaddam is under scrutiny by its trading partners.A direct threat to his power is the Duke Atreides,who has a son who has foretold prophecies of the future that have affected the Emperor.The Emperor schemes to let the Duke take control of the mining operations on Arrakis.However Baron Harkonnen the sadistic ruler of another planet has been given permission by the Emperor to invade Arrakis and kill the Duke and his son and take control of the mining operations there.<br />The Duke,his son and mother arrive on Arrakis and are given a tour of the spice mining operations.The biggest threat to the miners are the gigantic worms that are attracted to sounds and have been known to destroy the machines and kill miners in the process.The Fremen are the inhabitants of Arrakis and up until now their numbers have been vastly underestimated.The Duke wants to make an alliance with the Fremen but before he can do that the Harkonnens attack.During this time the Duke is killed but his son and his mother escape into the deep deserts.While seeking refuge from a sandworm they meet up with a local tribe of Fremen.They take the dukes son to be a fulfillment of a long held prophecy,which coincides with the myriad of dreams the Dukes son has had all of his life.He is now the Muaddib and becomes leader of the Fremen.He leads a revolt against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and regains control of Arrakis for the Fremen.The film ends as rain,which hasn't fallen in centuries,comes down on an astonished populace.<br />Director David Lynch focuses I think too much on the characters of the film such as the Baron Harkonnen,played a little over the top by Ken McMillan,and leaves the plot to meander from one episode to the other.It seems to shift from an over the topper like the Baron to an understated and more subtle performance such as Dr Kynes,played nicely by Max Von Sydow,and back again.As a result the film is reduced to a roller coaster ride that can get boring awfully fast.<br />Technically the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and needs a remastering as the film can be a bit too grainy at times.There are no extras to speak of.<br />In conclusion Dune is just an average film chock full of great talent that really had no where to go.Dune,to do the book(s)up right,should be given to a Peter Jackson,who did the Lord of the Rings up properly.He could do great things with this series of Sci-Fi classics,but if you're looking for Dune done properly,read the books;it hasn't been put onto celluloid yet!des with the myriad of dreams the Dukes son has had all of his life.He is now the Muaddib and becomes leader of the Fremen.He leads a revolt against the Harkonnens and the Emperor and regains control of Arrakis for the Fremen.The film ends as rain,which hasn't fallen in centuries,comes down on an astonished populace.

1416550542|1.0|This book sounded so compelling and had so many great readers reviews that I ordered it at my book club and spent $13 for it. What a waste of money and time!!!<br />Obviously the younger readers nowadays have no comparison with really great and fascinating historical novels.<br /><br />First of all: why three different time lines and changing all the time from one to the other until it really got confusing? The grandmother time line easily could have been skipped and simply been told within the rest of the text, the novel could have had at least 200 pages less.<br />Second: to me it sounded like several other stories that I have read in the past (but written in a much better style), for instance by Victoria Holt, Barbara Erskine and others.<br />This novel simply didn't compell or surprise me.<br />Third: the longer I continued reading, the more confusing and boring it got. Not a good sign!<br /><br />Definitely no keeper and my first and last attempt in reading Kate Morton.<br /><br />&quot;Forever Amber&quot; (Kathleen Winsor), &quot;Ang&eacute;lique&quot; (Anne Golon), Barbara Erskine and Victoria Holt are so much better in their writing style than this 7th grade student attempt of writing a historical novel. It seems strange to me that the publishing house gave this author a chance.
B005TD4GTO|5.0|i've been looking forward to noel's first solo effort post oasis and this is exactly what i expected from this veteran songwriter. i somehow knew that his solo stuff won't have banging records like early oasis. so if you're looking for tracks like \\"rock n roll star\\" you won't get it here, most of the songs in the album are mid-tempo. however if you're a true fan of oasis you should've seen this coming since the \\"heathen chemistry\\" era. most of the songs noel sang on that album as well as the b sides are slow tracks albeit very good tunes. so if you've follow oasis since then, including their b-sides, this would be the type of material you would expect from him.  everybody's on the run- this song starts off with a bang, with its lushful orchestra and haunting choral accompanied by heavy drumbeat, this is the perfect way to start off the album. in a way i get the feeling that this noel's way of giving the finger to beady eye (the band liam and the rest of oasis created) i could almost hear him saying,\\"hey mate this is how you write a song!..\\" 5/5  dream on- this is a quirky song reminiscent of \\"round are way\\" but a bit slower. the official video of this song shows a pathetic boxer getting knock down more than he cared to count by a woman... 4/5  if i had a gun- \\"if i had a gun, i'd shoot a hole into the sun and love would burn this city down for you!\\" this is the first line of the song and a great line indeed. this is a love song that isn't derivative or trite. it's about a proclamation of love and hope from a romantic observing his paramour from afar. lyrically, this is one of noel's best. 5/5  death of you and me- this is 1st single. it's very reminiscent of \\"importance of being idle\\". it's a pretty solid track and very catchy. 3/5  i wanna live in a dream- this is my ultimate favorite song from the album. im a little bias with this song mainly due to the fact that i've heard the leaked demo years ago and i've been waiting for noel to release it properly. this songis very beatles-sque from chord changes to lyrical wordplay. i've always thought noel should've released this as a single but he opted not to. much like \\"everybody's on the run\\", this song is filled with orchestra and chorus. 5/5  aka... what a life!- this has an electronic drum beat albeit simple, actually adds a lot flavor to the song. if you're familiar with noel's side projects with chemical brothers during the mid-90's, this song sounds like an offspring to those tracks he's done with them. a lot of repetitive beats and guitar loops. 4/5  soldier boys and jesus freaks- this is more or less a shot at those groups/individuals who seemed to have lost their individuality due to deep seeded traditions, i think?!... or maybe i've over analyzed it but i guess you be the judge. 3/5  aka...broken arrow- this song is an enigma to me. for some reason every time i listen to it, i find new meaning to the song. my initial reaction was i thought it was about a man finding his soulmate but ultimately she leaves him. but after numerous listens, i thought it was about a person with broken dreams and find it difficult to live his life. this is another song whom i thought noel did a great job at building a lyrical maze or riddle and its up to one's interpretation. 4/5  stranded on a wrong beach- i think this song is about starting a new chapter in life. however, starting anew doesn't entirely mean one is free from the burden of one's previous life. therefore, eventhough you can start fresh you still have to carry some of the baggage from your previous life. this song is a little darker than the others. 3/5  stop the clocks- this is an old song from the oasis days but somehow never got the proper treatment of being released. i fell in love with this song lyrically and melodically at first listen. it's a good track to end an album with. 5/5  -----the following are reviews for exclusive tracks from either *itunes and **amazon.-----  let the lord shine a light on me- this is noel's attempt at writing a gospel song. it's well done and a little bit of pink floyd can be heard in the middle. 4/5  good rebel- it's a mix of beatles \\"ticket to ride\\" and bob dylan's \\"mr tambourine man.\\" a solid rocker. 3/5  *simple game of genius- noel's best non album track to date. its a slow track but crescendos with a solid guitar solo and crashes down serenely with piano and keyboard. aside from \\"i wanna live in a dream\\", this is my other favorite track. 5/5  **alone on the rope- a very quiet and somber song that resembles that of radiohead's trademark sound. this is another one of noel's strong outing with his wordplay. \\"I won't let your smile, get lost in the fog  I won't let your dreams, run away in the dark\\". great lyric from a great songwriter. 5/5

B002GHIPYI|3.0|Pretty good headphones, nice value for the price. Bass response if pretty cool.<br /><br />On certain songs and with certain EQs, they freak out and deliver almost no vocals and all bass, but I haven't had them long enough to see if just properly burning them in will remedy this.<br /><br />I bought these hoping that they'd give me relief from hurting ear syndrome brought on by smaller headphones that squash my ears, but these have pretty shallow wells as well, and can't be comfortably worn for more than an hour.

B004XN3FHA|1.0|After reading the strong reviews of this flashlight I purchased one and was initially very pleased with its performance.  After about a half dozen uses the power switch stopped working.  Fenix was no help trying to address the problem.  Their customer service is in China. I received an e-mail response from them that was difficult to understand due to the poor command of English. Fortunately Amazon honored the return request.  I received a replacement and right out of the box the mode switch did not work properly.  At first only 3 setings worked. Within a couple of days only 2 settings functioned (of course they were the lowest settings).  I will be retuning another light.  While it may be bad luck to have 2 units that don't work it speaks to a serious quality problem.  I have owned several Surefire lights that have worked flawlessly for years.  The high lumen rating of this light was what drew me to purchse it but the poor reliability will keep me from buying another product from Fenix.  If you chose to buy one I hope you have better luck.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|All the stuff I said before, realistic play, endless amounts of play, easy to work and all the different machines are really cool to look at.
B005I4JG80|4.0|There has been some backlash about this book, but it seems like it's coming from a place of defensiveness and from those who haven't actually read this book.<br /><br />The author does not convey the usual message that's present in a lot of these French-women books, the one of dreamy-eyed wishfulness and love of the culture at large. In fact, from the start, she sounds very much like a fish out of water and lets the readers know that she just doesn't feel like she fits in. It is clear that (obviously) she tries to fit in with the other mothers but there's usually something that just sets her a little apart from them.<br /><br />I did not find this book to be, as others have stated, \\"All American children are terrible\\" and that \\"all French children are perfect\\". There were displays of different parenting styles (the \\"hippie\\" mother that breastfeeds past birth, for example), none of which seemed to be pushed on the reader as the \\"correct\\" way of doing things. It was just the way different mothers had done things - but many of which had the same fundamentals as one another. This rings true in North American parenting as well!<br /><br />The book was more of an insight than a how-to book on how to parent. It showed that there are differences between the cultures (as one would expect) and that maybe, just maybe, there's something to be garnered from a french-style of parenting. On the flip side, I felt that there was also an open door that'd allow some North American mindset within a French methodology of bringing up your child.
B004T6IBNY|4.0|This is fun and not exactly but a lot like regular pinball and it's FUN.  The best part is that you never have to walk away because you're out of quarters.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|My mother thought \\"House\\" was just an actor until she saw his documentary on the blues. Thought he was great because she had never listened to that type of music. I bought it for her B-day present and she loves it! Great gift for great price.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Adobe is usually a good program in the experience I've had with it which isn't very much.  This works very well on my kindle, I can download the specials at my local grocery store to my Kindle.
0553573403|4.0|OK, from looking at lots of the 2 and 3 star reviews here, there are clearly some things you NEED to know before you read this.  Otherwise, you will spend your time complaining about things that make this a great book.<br /><br />First, know that it's not your mom's sci-fi.  There is very, very little \\"magic\\" and no wise wizards to save the day.  This seemed to throw a lot of readers off and make them quite angry, from the reviews that I read.  It's more of an \\"alternate world\\" type of science fiction than the style that some might be used to from today's TV shows and movies.<br /><br />Also, know that this is just one step in a long journey of a series of 7 books.  I think it's still 7 - seems like it changes as Martin writes.  Not every character is going to live for all 7 books, which is sad and difficult as you read it, but necessary for the story to move forward.  Some of the characters in this book, since it's the first, are children.  Don't count them out just because they're young - there is a good reason why Martin gives them a voice and lets you get to know them now.<br /><br />Now, also be ready for the violence, bloodshed, lies, gore, etc. etc. etc. that are integral to the plot of this book and the entire series.  People seem to be really angry about the comparisons that are made between Martin and Tolkien.  This is certainly no \\"LOTR\\" series - but that's a GOOD thing.  We already have \\"LOTR\\" so why would you want to read the same type of story again??  I would compare it a bit more to Stephen King's \\"The Dark Tower\\" series in some ways.  There is violence, accidental death and murder, not to mention some truly unsavory parts that make a reader feel a bit sick to the tummy.  But it's a wonderful, wonderful story that would be lessened by the editing of those portions.<br /><br />If you are the type of reader who wants sunshine and rainbows, heroes and heroines and perfect endings in a nifty little tied package, you won't want to read this.  Characters in this story are very human - meaning they are mean, nasty, greedy and they make poor choices.  They are also brave, loyal, loving and honest.  What they aren't is one thing at a time and for some readers, I guess, that makes them uninteresting and unlikable.  I think it makes them realistic and it makes me care about them more than any cardboard cut-out hero.  It's also vital to note that the characters are not safe - they are often in emotional and physical danger, and sometimes they don't get out of that danger.<br /><br />To try and be spoiler-free for those that have read this far and are still interested, here's how I would describe it:<br /><br />There's basically three storylines, that come together like a braid.  In the world where seasons last for years and decades rather than the traditional months, it has been summer for a long, long time and people are getting pretty nervous about the coming winter.  One strand of the braid involves the \\"Night Watch\\" who live in the far north along a wall of ice, guarding the kingdoms below from wild raiders, outlaws and keeping a watch for other even creepier things.  Another strand of the braid tells the tale of one of the northern-most families, the Starks of Winterfell, and how the family splits to take to life at court in the south and to try and stay and maintain Winterfell.  This is the thickest strand of the story.  Not only do we see the story through the eyes of the parents, Eddard and Catelyn, but we also see it through the eyes of most of their children - sons Robb and Bran, daughters Sansa and Arya and Eddard's \\"on the other side of the sheet\\" son, Jon.  Some stay at Winterfell, some go to King's Landing to the court and some go elsewhere.  This allows the reader to see the story from lots of perspectives.  Finally, the third strand of the braid involves the exiled daughter of the previous \\"mad\\" king, who was overthrown quite violently.  The daughter, along with her brother, have fled across the sea to theeast to try and spent years trying to find support to raise an army and reclaim the throne.<br /><br />Each chapter is told from a different character's viewpoint - which is difficult at first.  The jumps between age of the narrators, along with the difference between their own goals and knowledge, kept me interested in all characters.  Many readers seemed to really hate this - but I think when you are prepared for it, it's a very intriguing way to tell the story.<br /><br />Since this is just a step on the journey, the storylines are very much unresolved at the end of the book.  Each story has grown and evolved and many characters have changed or left the story, but each strand of the braid has grown thicket and more complex.  It is not a \\"cliffhanger\\" ending, but it does certainly compel you to get the 2nd book ASAP and get back into the story!an army and reclaim the throne.

B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|I forgot that I wasn't very good at this game when it was at the bowling alley I lived near when I was young.  I haven't gotten any better.  The game is good proper game play, I'm just not great at missle command.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|Ok....I think it's obvious that some of the other reviewers are the younger Twilight audience.  The shift of Bella's obsession from Edward to her unborn baby is absolutely correct.  I guess only a mother could understand that.  More than that, the entire story comes together.  Everything actually makes sense (mainly the love triangle and lack of imprinting from Jacob, which was hard to understand).  It was a fantastic summation of the characters and the character development.  I just hope Stephanie decides to elaborate on Jacab and Reneesme's story in the future.  Again....the younger fans may not understand the depth that all of the characters reach, and that's ok.  Just give the book another chance after you've had a few more ( or several more) years of life experience.  You may find a new appreciation for it.
B0071QIN00|1.0|have to agree alot with the 1 2 3star reviews didnt like the controls one bit at all there is alot more why i didnt like this revamp version of trial xtreme 2 but i did like the graphics again just like the first one of this game offered on here as faotd i didnt like it either
B001MEJY8W|3.0|After reading the positive reviews, I was really anticipating adding a gnarly, harrowing, and unique horror flick to my collection. WRONG.  Not in the least bit scary. I dozed off several times while watching it. Certainly not groundbreaking, or unique.  Totally overrated!!

0385523912|5.0|The story of North Korea can be told through many lenses. It is satisfying and simple to portray North Korea through the lens of an outsider, because in this country's case reality truly is stranger than fiction. In fact, it is so absurd that at times the narrative changes from describing a dark, totalitarian state to a farce. This has been done with great style by many, including the Vice Guide to North Korea and the graphic novel Pyongyang: A Journey in North Korea by Guy Delisle. I highly recommend them. A much more complicated story, both to obtain and to tell, is that of the people of North Korea. Nothing to Envy not only manages to tell that story, but does so with great empathy and clarity.  Told through the accounts of defectors during the great famine of the early 1990s, Demick weaves multiple stories into an epic tale of love, family, and sacrifice that had me holding back some tears by the end of the book. It didn't dawn until me until then, but I had been cheering for these people the entire way through. Although secondary to the stories themselves, as a Communist damnation this book is the best I've seen, particularly because Demick finds accounts of people from all across the power spectrum: from the highly favored caste, an eventual Workers' Party member, to the lowest, the family members of a former POW from South Korea. It's easy to spot the cracks even without direct pushes or narrative-making from the author, and makes for a compelling exploration of philosophy and systems of government. Through and through, this book deserves a read.
B005VTGB0S|4.0|Looks like I am a dinosaur since I have only the original version of the iPad and not the iPad2. I'll start with the negative stuff: The iPad is held in place by four straps that stretch over each corner. The upper right corner strap covers the on/off button.  So either you have to move the strap out of the way to power on or off the unit or else you have to press down on the strap over the button (which is what I do). It really is not difficult at all but the problem is all of that pressing (or, if you choose to move the strap instead) serves to weaken the seam and I suppose eventually that corner will have the possibility or probability of tearing. Once that is done then your iPad will no longer be securely held.  That is the only negative for me. The cover itself is nice and sturdy.  The iPad fits very well.  The inside felt lining is soft and will not harm the screen. The grooves for holding the iPad at the three different viewing angles do a good job - the iPad is stable at all three of the angles.  The strap for keeping the cover closed also works well. The stitching is strong and neat. I might quibble about the price being somewhat high, but compared to other products out there, it is reasonable (it's just that in general, products like these all tend to cost more than they are worth - at least Amazon's product fits very well and isn't some rebadged item that tries to be a one-size-fits-all solution.
1451648537|3.0|Admit it, this dude is an icon. Steve Jobs was pivotal in putting the personal computer on our collective radar. As with any man as influential as this there is always a story to tell; indeed, Isaacson makes use of this to fill up 656 pages. Unfortunately, much of this bulk only serves to hammer home one point: Jobs is unlikable, petulant, emotionally unavailable, and mean. (And even so, occasionally brilliant.) Perhaps this isn't the author's fault, but it sure felt like it at times. Early in the book, I simply felt a distaste for the man; he is exactly the kind of manager that I would despise working under. I didn't expect for him to do a 180 and reveal a warm fuzzy-bear side, but as the book went on I became more discontented.  Jobs never evolves as a person, and I grew to despise him for that. All of his infatuations (drugs, eastern religions, radical diets) do not seem to fundamentally improve him as a human in any way. Steve is static. His lack of personal growth paradoxically peaks with his battle with cancer. It is caught in an early and treatable stage, but Jobs remains recalcitrant to authority, refusing medical advice for a live-saving surgery, deciding instead to rely on extreme diets and alternative therapy. When he finally relents and has the surgery, he ends up aspirating his stomach contents into his lungs because he refuses to have his stomach pumped, against doctors' advice. Afterwards he complains that he \\"almost died because the doctors messed up a routine operation.\\" Cue me throwing down the book in disgust.  I cannot relate to Jobs on any level; his humanity is like a mythical beast listed in some cryptozoological manual. I suppose in that lies the fundamental drama of his life's story: Jobs was such a stiff arrow that it eventually killed him. Jobs is precisely what I guard myself against becoming, and maybe that scares me; maybe that's why I hate him so.  From a more technical standpoint, Isaacson could have easily pared the book down to a more manageable 500 pages, leaving out the multitudinous, distracting mentions of Jobs' \\"reality distortion field\\" and its supporting evidence (seriously Walter, we get it) and some of the more nuts-and-bolts descriptions of business deals found in the latter half of the book. Even with the personal insight that this book enabled, I'm going to have to say it missed the mark for all but the most involved Apple aficionados.

B003HV0TN2|5.0|This one had me losing sleep, skipping work, and left me generally useless until I'd managed to reach the final page, at which point I was pulling my hair out trying to get hold of the next book... However disruptive that may be for my social life it's generally a good indicator for the book in question.  You begin this book with Kote, the quiet bartender in an out-of the way village who you quickly discover is not all he appears to be. Eventually you're introduced to Kvothe, an incredibly talented child who grew up to become the infamous 'Kingkiller' eventually resorting to faking his own death as a bid to escape attention. Once discovered by Chronicler, a travelling scribe, he agrees to tell his story but demands 3 days to do so. The first book covers the first of these three days where we learn how Kvothe came to learn magic in a desire to learn the Name of the Wind, and earned the first of his many titles `Kvothe the bloodless'. From the start we're warned that this story will span 3 books and I suspect that a subsequent trilogy will cover what happens next, as clearly Kvothe's story will not be limited to how he became so infamous.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game overall. you pick what you play, earning coins and such. I do recommend it to every age. bye
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Nice. It has some good games that is enjoyable for all age's. So it is a pretty good game except for the ads.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I'm enjoying the story so much I'm not spending any time thinking about what the author should or should not be doing.  The only complaint I have about any of the books is that the Cersei chapters in the last book were a grind at times.  She is an interesting character though.<br /><br />This book didn't have that Cersei grind and a went little past the time line of the last book.  All the characters people complained were missing in the last book are back.  Plus, we get to see Cersei go through some torment (loved that chapter).  Considering that, this book should not be suffering from the same low rating of the last book (not getting that - so many complaints addressed with this book and many of you don't seem any happier than you were with book 4 ?).<br /><br />ADVICE:  With the Kindle version you really don't have the ability to look back at the maps at the beginning of the book (and not really readable like the book).  I'd recommend printing out a couple of maps and keeping them with your Kindle so you can glance it them from time to time while reading.  Seeing where things are helps a lot I think.<br /><br />OTHER ADVICE:  After you read this book,there is a sample chapter from Book 6 on Martin's web site.  Also, when the paper back version of this book is released in June 2012, it will include a 2nd preview chapter from book 6.
1451627289|4.0|Having read a lot of Stephen King books, I was not sure what to expect. Some have been great (The Stand, Cujo) and some have been overly long wastes of time (The Tommyknockers).  I am pleased to report that this was one of Stephen King's better works. Yes, it is awfully long and the characters are about the same as they all are in King's books (hearts of gold, two-dimensional, solidly liberal, etc). However, for some reason I cannot readily articulate, I found myself caring more about them than I often do in King's books. The prose was lively and the plot kept me hooked despite the slow pace and predictable vitriol against people who are religious, conservative or otherwise establishment figures (I am not overly political, but, on behalf of many King fans who could also care less about his political agenda I would like to say WE GET IT!!!! MESSAGE RECEIVED!!!! PLEASE PUT THE 2x4 AWAY!!!!).  The only sour note was the ending. The book (at least to me) had an extremely gripping premise and kept me glued to my Kindle. I did not even mind that the hero did not exactly get the girl in the end. I would have preferred a happy ending as I was pretty invested in the characters, but I suppose the way things worked out added depth or something.  I just do not understand why King went all supernatural on us right at the end. I found the way in which he approached the time-travel truly inspired (you always go back to the same point, things zero-out if you do it again...). We stuck to that for hundreds of pages only to have things (out of almost nowhere) get wacky with earthquakes, end of everything, metaphysics, blah, blah, blah... I don't get it. If the point was to show saving Kennedy was a bad idea, King could have simply stuck to the dystopia concept and not introduce the \\"end of days\\" thing. What did all the wrath of God stuff add? If you took away all the natural disasters would the hero not have changed things back anyway?  As it is, this awkward ending left me hollow. We, the readers, knew from the start there was no guarantee that saving Kennedy was a good idea. We were prepared for the eventuality it would not work out well but also traveled under the assumption that it could be a great thing (hence the suspense). Once the supernatural garbage came into play (right at the end), we realized that there was no such uncertainty and that the entire enterprise was doomed before it started. We only had the illusion of suspense. All the effort, pain, and sacrifice was a complete waste in retrospect. This seems like breaking faith with the readership to some degree.  All in all, I am not sorry I bought this book, but a better ending would have made it really special.

B0028KGD8I|4.0|I love Dexter. This is truly one of the most avant-garde productions in the history of television. Seasons one and two are exquisite, exciting and enchanting. Seasons four and five are fresh, fun and invigorating. Season three, well, it's okay.<br /><br />Seasons one and two bounce off the foundation of the novels. In season three, the show tries to find its own separate destiny, and it gets off to a less than stellar start. Season three is the show's awkward phase. It spurts and sputters along trying to find its legs, which it does in the last couple of episodes of the season, but its a tedious journey to get to those episodes. Season three has great character development and not just for Dexter. Each member of the cast fleshes out as much more fully developed and realized individuals. These are my T.V. Friends and I adore them and loved watching them develop their quirky personalities, yet the plot driven writing on season three is weak.<br /><br />If your new to Dexter and just watched seasons one and two, go ahead and watch Season three for the character development, and forgive it its many flaws, because the best is yet to come. Season four picks up the ball and runs with it and season five will leave you gasping for air.<br /><br />As a series, Dexter has raised the bar for innovative quality storytelling, just not in this season.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This exhilerating novel was so compelling and intense I could not afford to put it down. READ THIS NOVEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That is all. I love Suzanne Collins's writing style.
B005LAIIRQ|2.0|A group of men work at an outpost where they draw natural resources from a planet (oil, I believe, in this case). Liam Neeson is a sniper who picks off the local predators when they attack. Some of the men are flying back to their primary settlement called Anchorage, I assume it is so named because the outline of the landmass is remarkably similar to that of Alaska. Their transport crashes in a frozen wilderness. They are beset by the predators which bear a superficial physical resemblance to wolves. The men even call them \\"wolves\\". These aren't very creative people.<br /><br />The story of how the survivors of the crash persevere is well made and includes some very good scenes. Overall though, it's a pretty stupid movie. The animated/animatronic creatures aren't especially credible. And it's pretty obvious the reason these predators are attacking is that the humans have wiped out their natural prey - after all they are the only non-human creatures we see in an entire two hour movie that takes place entirely out doors. As a survey of varieties of ways to die, though, it's pretty thorough.

0385534639|1.0|The prose was over done and the story line was jagged -- jumping from event to event, place to place. The characters didn't develop -- but how could they? They were more  \\"things\\" than people. I tired of reading \\"magical\\" and \\"glowing candles\\" and other over descriptive sentences. If you enjoy reading of illusionists and the paranormal, then this book is for you.

B000SGGUWS|5.0|I saw the book and thought it was like the show but it is way better than the  show.
B004EPZ070|4.0|Something Borrowed is definitely a chick flick, however... as much as it disappoints me to say this, I actually *liked* it.  I'm so ashamed of myself!  A grown 30-year old man shouldn't like a comedy like this!  Oh well, haha.  It's about Ginnifer Goodwin's character playing the role of a best friend to Kate Hudson, and... one night during a party (a BORING party in the beginning that's 5 minutes of uselessness- you've been warned!) she actually BETRAYS her best friend by sleeping with Kate's fiance.  The storyline is that Ginnifer hides this little bit of information from her best friend for the entire movie.  Will Kate ever find out?  You'll have to watch it and see!  A lot of the laughs are actually funny though.  Ginnifer Goodwin steals the show, and like always with these type of comedies, the boyfriend/fiance acts like filler who pretends to be funny and romantic but from my point of view (a guys) he's anything but!  He just stands around and... I guess women find these type of men appealing but for all the men out there reading this review of mine- you know they aren't in the least bit funny!  However I DID actually laugh at some of these jokes (as much as I truly don't want to admit it, haha) so... avoid the 5-10 minutes in the beginning and the storyline soon develops into a nicely written, well-meaning storyline involving friends and relationships.  I recommend it!  Oh, and you just KNOW Ginnifer Goodwin is going to resemble Sally Field 30 years from now, lol.

B0070Z4M4I|3.0|The movie was ok, it could have been a lot better and I feel that the story was a bit rushed just to answer all the questions that myself and I'm sure others had asked when they first saw the original. The CGI I would have to say is the biggest flaw of the movie. With the original,everything was created by hand and was puppeteer'd by someone. In other words, it looked more real and felt real. As for this movie the CGI just goes way too far and even though it may look kinda scary or gruesome, your eyes can easily tell what is real and isn't in this movie. It was a nice attempt at a prequel but it was in my opinion a failed one. I will recommend that anyone who was a fan of the original to watch it, but only so they can decide for themselves if it's good or not.
0385534639|5.0|I purchased the kindle version of this book one late insomniac night when I was out of reading material. This intolerable state of affairs should be easily resolved with the kindle offerings expanding by the moment, but I find it difficult to sort wheat from chaff in fiction lately. Still, the reviews were mostly promising and I was in the mood for some magic.  Magic is exactly what this book is.  I am a very fast reader; often I read books in a single day. This one I found myself parceling out like dessert after a virtuous dimmer, to try and make the treat last longer.  I have never before read a book structured as this one was; there are marvelously evocative vignettes sprinkled throughout that have no bearing on the plot itself, except as atmosphere. This evidently has irritated some reviewers, but I loved the beauty and mood of them. It was like intermissions for the brain; keeping you in the setting without requiring anything of you for that moment.  The rest of the book I found marvelously unpredictable. Too often, because there is nothing new under the sun, it's easy to know what shape a book is taking before you are halfway through it. Not so The Night Circus! I am somewhat puzzled by negative reviews lamenting the lack of dimension to the characters. While Morgenstern does not feed the reader a framework for all the relationships and interdependencies, I rather enjoyed being able to infer and decide for myself, and I thought the characters were each distinct, their motivations either clear or deliberately obfuscated because of their very nature.  No need to go into the story outline; suffice it to say this is one of the best books I have read in a very long time. If you're on the fence, I hope you'll tip, & read it.
B0064MT1NU|1.0|Watched this for the first time a few weeks ago as I am a huge Sam Neill fan. I couldn't believe how abhorrent this movie was. Even the next day I asked myself several times why the heck I just didn't turn the terrible thing off. The characters are static and dull. There is way too much naked Harvey Keitel and Anna Paquin is just as mind numbing to watch as a child as she is today, if not more so. Do not watch this piece of garbage, its a waste of time. I wish I had the 2 1/2 hours of my life back....and I am still wondering how it managed Academy Award status.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|I went into this movie expecting a descent sci-fi flick.<br /><br />I wound up watching one of the best movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />The character development put into Caesar was incredible.  The portrayal of him as chimp, but a chimp with human intelligence was superb.  Never did this movie cause me to lose sight of the fact he was a chimp (easy to do when giving animals human characteristics) nor did I ever think of him as less than intelligent.<br /><br />The interaction between the various apes (pre-gassing) is from what I can tell pretty close to genuine.<br /><br />I left this movie wanting more.  I left this movie wanting to see the next movie where the Will Rodman (James Franco) acts as an ambassador on the behalf of the apes to establish the area of forest their in as sovereign ground, the apes not happy with being confined initially try to leave and integrate and eventually decide to have their own revolution after being treated as, well, damned dirty apes.  There's going to be a sequel from what I've read, I have no idea what it will entail, but this paragraph is simply what went through my mind.<br /><br />I don't care if you hated the original Planet of the Apes movie series.  I don't care if you hated the first modern \\"reimagining\\" give this one a shot, it's incredibly good.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This is THE comedy Christmas movie to watch !!! Chevy Chase at his best !!! Also has hilarious scenes from Randy Quaid as Clark Griswold's (Chevy Chase) redneck cousin Eddie. Has great soundtrack and never a dull moment.Can't go wrong with this one !!
B0012QCZ54|4.0|\\"Step Up 2: The Streets\\" is a sequel to \\"Step Up\\".  This movie features different characters, but continues similar themes of urban teens navigating relationships and expressing themselves through hip-hop style dance.<br /><br />I wonder if anyone watched \\"Breakin\\" 1, 2, \\"Krush Groove\\" or \\"Beat Street\\" in research. Know your history.. (on a side note, it would have been interesting to get Adolpho Quinones and Michael Chambers to play some bit parts.)<br /><br />The film is surprisingly effective. It's clearly a formula film, broadly in the underdog-youth-team-of-misfits genre. Whatever the various plot holes, it is very professionally shot and put together. Excellent choreography and cinematography.  There is also plenty of hip-hop dance music by contemporary artists of the genre (a bonus CD soundtrack would have been nice for the DVD release.)<br /><br />That the main point-of-view characters/romantic leads were Caucasian was somewhat to be expected for a major studio film. To the filmmakers credit, they did feature a multi-cultural cast, though only a few of the characters are given personalities.<br />It's unclear how much of her own dancing that Briana Evigan did, but she's sympathetic and compelling as the tough-but-sensitive Andie.<br /><br />Some quibbles: Several of the characters here don't rise above stereotypes, (the talented dork Moose, the bullying rival crew leader Tuck.) It's curious that the director, John Chu, is Asian-American, and the one prominent Asian character is a foreign exchange student with a choppy accent who speaks in clipped catchphrases. And does anyone from the 'hood dance crews go to school at all? (To that point, I suppose it was nearly unavoidable, but many of the actors/dancers featured here skew too old to pass as current high school students. Though I'm sure this is neither here nor there with the target audience for the film.)<br /><br />\\"Step Up 2\\" earned even more money than its predecessor at the box office.  It is a technically proficient film and hits the right notes for its genre.  Children and teens will get the most out of watching this.genre.

0743437497|4.0|Here's the thing about Stephen King.<br /><br />... He scares the bejeezus out of me.<br /><br />Seriously.  So, I'm going to tell you a story about picking this book up.  No joke at all. This is what happened.<br /><br />I picked up The Shining around 9pm at night.  I wanted to read, it was there, it needed to be read.  But I'd heard horrors about Anthony Hopkins and that hotel in Colorado and.. I wanted to be able to sleep.  So I told myself - I'll read 'til it gets scary.<br /><br />150 pages later, I thought.. huh, this isn't that bad. I'll keep reading...<br /><br />Then my mind began to process everything coming through it and OH MY GOSH I COULD NOT CLOSE MY EYES.<br /><br />I fully expected lots of gore, lots of slashing madness, but what I didn't expect was the psychological impact something like a shaking elevator, or locking someone in a walk-in fridge would do to me.  My hands were SHAKING as I read the book, but.. to be honest, it was a lot of fun and I can't wait to muster the courage to dive into my next Stephen King adventure - \\"It\\".
B006UG90RM|1.0|The one star is for the sheer \\"balls\\" to actually enter the studio and lay down this crap. After listening to the first 5 tracks, an easy conclusion was reached. I will not even download this tripe from an MP3 source for free.

B00280LYIC|4.0|Rick Riordan did a great job puting these books together. I recomend this book to all who have an intrest in greek mythology. I give this book five stars. It`s one of those books that you just cant put down let alone go to bed at night. this first book introduces all the characters. if you get the sample youll be sure to love it

B001L1S1SK|5.0|I've been waiting to see Season 3 for quite some time. For unknown reasons it was never released here in NZ on DVD. I'd forgotten how funny Season 3 was until I finally got the DVD. I fell in love witht the show from Season 1 and watched every episode through to the end of Season 2.  The character of Betty is very inspirational - she knows her values and won't compromise them. She speaks out and is not afraid of trying. She learns her lessons and trys to make her life and her family's life better.  The character inspires me each time I watch an episode. It is such a pity that the show only went for 4 Seasons. It was well written, well filmed and extremely well cast. Although some of the story lines were a bit beyond belief, the show as a whole was a joy to watch. I recommend Ugly Betty to everyone - it's the sort of show which lifts you up when you are down. Definately one of the best comedy shows in recent years.

0385340990|5.0|Oh, how glad I am that I didn't put this audiobook away after being disappointed in the initial portion of the first CD.  Other audiobooks that I've listened to are primarily spoken by one or two speakers.  Guernsey Literary Society audiobook is read by the characters, and I learned to love listening to their various voices.  Similar to NPR newscasts, I found myself sitting in my car long after I had returned home.  Even now, a few weeks after completing the series, I hear the character's voices in my head.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed reading as much as I did the audiobook.  The storyline lends itself beautifully to an audiobook. Can't wait to see the movie.
B006TVQTHW|5.0|Likes:  *Sturdy, with nicely rolled edges throughout that won't cut you.  * 3 external 5.25 drive bays is just right.  *No external 3.5\\" drive bays. Use an external card reader or adapter dongle.  *Side and front panels are hinged, easy to remove.  *Roomy enough for 9\\"x12\\" boards with SATA ports mounted sideways.  *\\"Sideways\\" HDD bays make drive swapping easier.  *2 of the 3 fan intakes are filtered.  *Quiet fans, more than adequate for stock usage and even mild overclocking.  *\\"Tool-Less\\" bays work nicely.  *Cutout behind the CPU area makes installing giant coolers very easy.  *Fan behind the CPU. Case makers ignored that excellent cooling opportunity for years.  *Looks great, very sleek and simple.  *No cheesy, bulbous \\"convenience panels\\" which cause a real birds nest of wires.  *My Hyper212+ cooler and Ripjaws RAM all fit just fine!  *Cable management is awesome! Never had such a clean and easy build!  Dislikes:  *Has too many (6)internal 3.5 bays. If you need more than 4 HDD's, get a full tower!  *Side doors should have captive thumb screws. Even Dell uses them.  * No 3.5\\" to 2.5 HDD bay adapters were included,  the \\"mounting holes\\" are useless.  *Rear 120mm exhaust fan is too weak for overclocking, though perfect for stock usage.  *Fans should have come with 4 pin connectors for automatic fan control.  *2 of the120mm fan intake grills are unfiltered, rendering the other filters useless.  *The front headphone jack is too tight, and almost ruined my expensive ear buds. (fixt).  *Fan grills are stamped honeycomb, far less efficient than concentric wire grills.  *Need a cable management access hole for the EATX power cable.  I wish Antec would have designed in a separate ~7\\" wide by ~16\\" tall door for quick access to the internal drive bays. I also wish the sideways drive bays were handy USB3 and SATA hot docks. A push button latch to open the front door would have been nice. Instead, you have to remove the left side panel in order to remove the front panel. Huh?What was Antec thinking?  This is a great case. It's designed for the mid level enthusiast, and did not disappoint me on the important features. Some of my complaints were easily fixed. I moved the rear fan to beneath the CPU,  added a stronger fan in its place, and also made all the fans system speed controlled. I am ordering a pair of 2.5\\" HDD mounting adapters for my SSD's.  I am also contemplating cutting out the honeycomb grilles and replacing them with proper chromed wire grilles.  I know there seems to be a lot of negatives in my review, but most are very minor annoyances. In fact, many people may prefer what I perceive as annoyances. Buy this case, you won't regret it either way!

B000002IP1|5.0|Phil's CDs tend to be hit-and-miss affairs, except &#34;But Seriously&#34; where every song is a winner (except maybe I Wish It Would Rain - which is ok but a little tedious and boring and is ruined by Eric Clapton's pointless gutiar playing).  This is CD is better than his &#34;Hits&#34; CDs, and is the place to start any Phil Collins collection.  Here is a song by song rating:   1. Hang In Long Enough - 10 - A great starter -- Awesome fast-paced opener with amazing horns -- much better than Sussudio   2. That's Just The Way It Is - 10 - Great ballad - sets the tone   3. Do You Remember? - 10 - Another great ballad - definitely one of his best   4. Something Happened On The Way To Heaven - 10 - Another awesome faster paced song with great horns   5. Colours - 10 - Great ballad with awesome faster paced ending - amazing!   6. I Wish It Would Rain Down - 7 - Worst song here - Eric Clapton's unfocused guitar is annoying and ruins an already somewhat boring song   7. Another Day In Paradise - 10 - Another amazing ballad   8. Heat On The Street - 9 - Another great song - this one really grows on you   9. All Of My Life - 9 - And yet another great ballad  10. Saturday Night And Sunday Morning - 8 - OK - not sure why it is here  11. Father To Son - 9 - Another great ballad leading up to an amazing finish......  12. Find A Way To My Heart - 10 - AMAZING finish -- His BEST song of all time!! WOW!!!!!! Can't believe this is not on any of his Hits of Live albums??  Well, Find a Way to My Heart is FINALLY available as in a live version on the bonus CD.  I was really really looking forward to it but unfortunately an over-zealous female singer ruins it.  Why did Phil let her join him on this wonderful song???  She yells her way through, has an awful voice and TOTALLY RUINS IT!!!  Is there another place to find a good live version of this amazing song??
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I rated this game earlier when I had just started playing it. I enjoyed it immediately but, after playing through, I can't say enough about how much I loved it! visually beautiful, entertaining and challenging! I look forward to more like this!
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|I can't believe it took this long to get to America but thank god it actually got here, and in Blu-Ray. This movie is such an amazing, breathtaking accomplishment of modern Japanese animation that it makes it a must-see for anyone looking to see something new and exciting.  The animation style is a seriously stylish mix of Samurai Champloo (the director was an animator for it), Heavy Metal, Speed Racer, J-pop neon color, F-Zero. This is the first anime I think I've seen that has a clear homage to American animation influences like Heavy Metal and Speed Racer, also to American Rock music (JP's hair is clearly Elvis-style). But what it does is mix all of this together with the Japanese style in such a cool and, ultimately, unique and visually captivating way.  Since the movie has the advantage of being released in the digital, blu-ray age, we are given a COMPLETE SOURCE transfer. That means absolutely no specs, grains, washed-out colors, etc... This is the cleanest a hand-drawn animation can look without being done on a computer. That's why this movie is such a success. The sheer imagination and heart that went into the artwork makes a greatly convincing argument for the beauty and potential of hand-drawn artwork that has completely been absent from American animation.  The music is the next best part. It starts out with the main anthem, \\"Yellow Line\\" and gets into the action right away with about an 8-minute race opening that right away captures the awesome feel that the rest of the movie will throw at you.  It captivates the tone and emotions at the right points and even gets a little touching at some points as there is a small amount of melodrama to keep this movie from being without any depth, not that it's totally needed but it's a nice touch. The music captures that Redline has this soulful heart to it that you just latch on to.  The story itself is not complex, but that's good because is if it got TOO convoluted in talking then we couldn't really enjoy the limits of animation that this movie pushes so well. The melodrama with JP and with himself and Sonoshee it makes the movie come together in the end that brings out the heart of the creators and staffers on the project that just makes this film special. I'm so happy this movie came out because I was really starting to mourn the end of Japanese animation, especially with the loss of Satoshi Kon. This movie has a soul and that makes it so much more necessary to witness.  That brings me to my only complaint. The dubbing in English was done by Manga Entertainment. That means the dub was given a \\"typical anime\\" dub in English. While JP, Sonoshee, and Frisbee's voices are all fine there are other voices that are awkward and too anime that distracts from the universality of the animation. In Japanese, the voices are less cartoonish and more realistic, which makes the movie much better and more in line with the creator's vision. Thankfully, the English and Japanese tracks are both True HD so you can choose which one you like.  Bottom Line: Get Redline. It's beautiful. It's inspirational. It's great. These animators deserve the money for making such an amazing work of art. It doesn't matter whether or not you like anime, this isn't an \\"anime\\" it's a Japanese animation and appeals to a wider swatch of people. It's exciting and the movie just goes by so quick because of how awesome it is. BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!

B0073LWEXK|5.0|I loved the game... if you like point and click adventures like myst, then this is probably right up your alley. It isn't one that you have to read cheats the whole way through, which is nice.

B000021Y77|5.0|We have a strange category of movies in our house: the Zen movie. In this is category, Run Lola Run is  one of the best. (Also of this genre: Being There with Peter Sellers, Groundhog Day.)<br /><br />Yes, it's got violence and young people perhaps not behaving in a fashion that some adults may favor.<br />It's in German and the hero is female. Some of the movie is animated. There even could be a cigarette or two lit. None of this should throw you off: all of this creates one of my favorite films ever.<br /><br />The deeply talented and charming Franke Potente needs to do more films.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|\\"The Misremembered Man\\" is a story about the way orphans and abandoned children were treated by a system that should have nourished them.  Until I read this book I was completely--might I say blissfully?---ignorant about this disgraceful chapter in the history of the Church.  At times, when I read scenes featuring the orphanage, I was tempted to put the book away; the suffering was just too painful for me to \\"witness.\\"  However, I soldiered on; the story was too provocative to abandon.  Furthermore, just when despair threatens to overwhelm, kindness intervenes.  Even though the ending is a bit predictable, the story is intriguing and well worth the read.  In addition, the juxtaposition of good versus evil is indelibly etched throughout the book.  A  reminder of how even the most benign of organizations can turn malevolent if good people fail to monitor them.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app. I use it for a quick devotional in the mornings before everyone else gets up. I t is a great way to start the day; however, if I miss a day, it won't let me log in without going through the whole &quot;forgotten password&quot; thing, which means I lose that time. Actually, that is good, too, because it keeps me on task.

0307592731|4.0|Hiking is good for the soul. It helps center one's life. And so it was that Strayed took off at a moment's notice to conquer her fears, depression to hike the Pacific Coastal Trail (PCT) the trail that spans 2,650 miles from Mexico to the Canadian Border, crossing through California, Oregon and Washington.<br />For Strayed it was not so much the distance she hiked but he distance she was away from real life. Starting in Modesto, CA she made it through ice fields, rock falls, bear and the occasional rattlesnake to the far side of Oregon. With all the physical difficulties of hiking, from sore muscles and broken feet to the extra precautions any young woman hiking on her own has to face the journey was accomplished and life began anew.<br />I was very pleasantly drawn into this story of accomplishment having hike the PCT's eastern cousin the Appalachian Trail, under similar circumstances, about ten years ago and so many times I found myself nodding or uttering agreement to the trials and tribulations Strayed voiced. It was quite the mini flash-back and I really enjoyed basking with her on her backpacking journey.<br />Like those before and those to come this life's journey was one of abolishing one's fears and striving for a new beginning.<br />[[ASIN:0307592731 Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail]]

B006W0QOF2|1.0|This was hands down the worst movie I've seen in a long time.  I kept thinking it would get better at some point and it never did.  Granted, I'm not the artsy, read-between-the-lines kind of person.  In fact there were hardly enough lines of dialogue for me to read between, I think it took Gosling all of 20 minutes to memorize the 10 or so lines he has in this movie.  Apparently there must be some kind of deeper meaning to this one that escaped my limited intelligence if people are rating it 5 stars.  It seemed to me like the plot could've been written by a 10 year old.  If you frequently \\"find meaning\\" in rocks and dirt, you'll love this movie.  Otherwise do yourself a favor and never watch it.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|Absolute garbage! Trying to be too clever through \\"art\\", this film is just an annoying mash up of visual mumbo jumbo. Forget about it if you want a film where you can follow a story. It's not clever and is just a waste of money. I had to turn it off, we watched and waited for it to do something given it had won awards, but alas it went from clouds to dinosaurs to other rubbish. Don't waste your time!
B000J5XS3C|5.0|The 802 is solidly constructed and does exactly what it's supposed to do for a small mixer. One improvement would be perhaps making the lower six button controls click into each change to right or left rather than just roll. But that is a small problem one overcomes with experience with the unit. Excellent mixer and well priced.
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|this movie was so terrible i almost killed my self in the theater and i saw it with my niece
B001DHXT1G|3.0|It wasn't a tall order to improve upon Ang Lee's disastrous 2003 effort, which was simply horrible in every way. Transporter director Louis Leterrier turns up the action, while maintaining a light touch without compromising the drama. But, like Iron Man released earlier that summer, it's utterly brainless entertainment with no lasting merit whatsoever.<br /><br />Bruce Banner (now more appropriately played by Edward Norton instead of Eric Banana) is living in South America, away from the authorities who want to turn his curse into a weapon. Over-confident Army soldier Emil Blonsky (a very small, old, and un-threatening Tim Roth) wants a shot at capturing the Hulk, but gets smashed in the process. He is quickly repaired with a magic potion and turns into The Abomination, a creature even more fake than the big, green CGI guy.<br /><br />Like other comic-book movies that preceded it, the ending is nothing but two CGI effects thumping each other until one of them doesn't get back up, while the surrounding environment is destroyed for our 'enjoyment'. I am honestly sick to death of this. The Punisher, with Thomas Jane, kept it real and gritty and it flopped. But CGI trash like Spider-Man, Iron Man, Hulk and Fantastic Four make hundreds of millions. It doesn't make sense to me.<br /><br />Personally, I feel that comic-books are more suited to TV where the characters and plots can be developed over long periods of time instead of rushing through everything with generic, tired motivations in 110 minutes. While this movie is not bad, even the 1978 TV show was better. It sets up a lot for the long-in-development Avengers movie, which is so low on my priorities list it's completely subterranean, including the creation of 'The Leader'. But I doubt we will ever see the character in any sequel, mid-quel, prequel, or spin-off. There's just too much material, and not enough time to fully explore everything.<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk is an inoffensive time-waster. Don't go out of your way for it.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks good in 2.35:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound and a fair amount of extras.ood in 2.35:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound and a fair amount of extras.

B00110K62U|5.0|This is the BEST concert version of Les Miserables out there! DREAM CAST = WONDERFUL. Each and every actor/actress was MADE to play the role they were assigned! This version is totally better than the 25th anniversary edition. I have this on VHS and DVD. &lt;3
B0052UZIFA|3.0|It's pretty good but it doesn't have all the features every other version of this game does and has a serious lack of updates...
0307352145|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this work; it was very engaging and hard to put down.  The depth of research was expansive and balanced; there was an easy flow to the material which would easily categorize it as a page turner.  Most importantly the reader could easily identify and emphatize with the positions being advanced.  If you're the sort of individual who craves thought provoking literature packaged with many human elements and examples in between to liven the discussion/debate without being condescending then I highly recommend this book.
B005I4JG80|5.0|As a mother with young children, and a lover of French lifestyle (I once lived in Paris) I was very excited to read this book. Bringing Up Bebe is mainly a memoir of Ms. Druckerman's experience as an American raising her children in Paris. Her observations are very valid and are worth at least considering. The observations that interested me the most were \\"Le Pause\\" with regards to sleep, the less snacking technique (makes sense as to why kids might not be hungry for lunch or dinner if they've been snacking all day), and the elements of the 'cadre'. With books like these one must pick and choose what would work for their lifestyle. It is also worth noting that this book is very well written and funny. I found it charming and am glad I could take away so many interesting tips for being a better parent. A great read.
0525478817|5.0|I'll put this book in my top five all time books and it's at the top for the past year. John Green tackles the most serious of life's subjects with a humor, poignancy and depth that are of the highest quality literature. Yet it's so down to earth and easy to read, the zingers will sideswipe you with an unexpected potency. I laughed and cried while reading it then dwelled on the many deeper messages and symbolism after I put it down. A great work for all ages.
0071752854|5.0|I didn't expect to be quite so blown away by this... but by my own results I guess I really am. The instructions on framing really, truly work. Two successful pitches right after finishing the book. Ok fine, after getting halfway through the book.

0385344228|3.0|As a long-time legal transcriptionist, I don't usually read fiction set in the legal world (with the exception of Jodi Picoult), although I understand that the reality of the courtroom is generally much too boring for fiction.  I made an exception for \\"Defending Jacob\\" because it sounded intriguing and was reviewed so well.  William Landy definitely kept me reading to see how things panned out - hence, the three-star rating - and exploring the viability (or lack thereof) of the \\"murder gene\\" could have been fascinating.  However the old \\"unreliable narrator\\" device just didn't work in this novel. In order to pull it off, the writing, plotting and characterization have to be flawless, and none of those things came close.  In my opinion, I think a limited third-person POV would have served his purposes much better, and I could have done without the ridiculous parodies of transcription.  The \\"surprise ending\\" was pathetically evident after the first third of the book, and the general cluelessness of his main characters grew more and more unbelievable as time went on.  There is something to be said for William Landy's talent in that I truly *wanted* to believe, but I wound up feeling emotionally manipulated, being set up for the twist that wasn't a surprise at all, only to be left hanging as to the ultimate outcome.  That being said, however, I do think William Landy is a talented writer with great potential, and I would give another of his books a try.
B0071QIN00|5.0|Great game. it is amazing how far phone games have comer in such a short time and this game is an awesome example.
B0010SKUYM|3.0|It was obvious from the first words that Rothfuss is trying really, REALLY hard to be poetic, intriguing, enchanting, and mysterious. Everything you could want in a fantasy book, right? Wrong. Rothfuss's strained attempt to evoke these feelings comes off as cumbersome, overly descriptive, forced, lacking depth, and just plain boring at times. What I'm saying is: Just because you can think up a good story doesn't mean you should be the one penning it.<br /><br />The writing is not polished, not \\"clean\\" and flowing. I was too busy fumbling over the awkwardness, being distracted by the  predictability, and feeling deflated at the impossible length (really? seven hundred pages?? only about 300 has any real content) to get lost in the world Rothfuss was trying so desperately to create. Really, it was the awkwardness that I found most difficult to get past, and I spent much of my reading time squirming and rolling my eyes, even skipping entire sections to spare myself. I kept hoping the writing would mature as I went on, but it did not. There is the Mary Sue-like quality of Kvothe, but that has been discussed at length in other reviews, so I'd prefer to talk about the awkwardness.<br /><br />The best examples of this are the numerous attempts at VERY AWKWARDLY and painfully trying to describe Denna's beauty. No man, not even Kvothe, who has ever seen Denna, much less slept with her (which seemed to be everyone but Kvothe), could ever hope to adequately describe her impossible perfection. So perfect is she, that none of these men are jealous of each other. Instead, they simply bond over being thankful to have gotten whatever they could from her--a smile, a touch, a night of passion, whatever. In case you aren't getting it: No woman as wonderful as Denna ever existed before and no woman like her will ever exist again! Apparently, this also makes all men blind to the fact that she is flighty, evasive, a liar, emotionally abusive, uses men like tools, manipulative, and sleeps with someone new every night. In fact, they find these things charming and \\"fall for her like wheat before a scythe.\\" Talk about setting expectations! Even her immense flaws (which aren't her fault, but the fault of her circumstances and the men who approach her!) are endearing, making her vulnerable and in need of protection. Yet, I am still lost about what, exactly, they find amazing in her because, despite her amazingness, she has the least depth of all the characters in the book.<br /><br />Honestly, most of the time I felt like I was reading the fantasies of a school boy, not a story written by an adult man. I hate to do it, but I'm going to go there: It was like in \\"Twilight,\\" when Bella is constantly describing Edward's beauty, but it was obvious we will never, EVER in a million years understand how god-like Edward is, except that instead of using the same five words over and over, Rothfuss can never actually find ANY words to describe Denna, so we are forced to stumble along with him for several paragraphs after which he just gives up and says it's impossible to find the words. Rothfuss should borrow Meyer's thesaurus because then at least he would have five words. I am not sure which is more annoying and distracting--using the same five words to describe someone repeatedly or repeatedly trying to describe someone and failing altogether. Much like my going on and on about his inability to describe this woman, this is what it was like to read the book, which happened every 50 pages for several paragraphs (even pages!) at a time. Eventually, if I might be crass, I felt like Kvothe just needed to get laid and that would solve his impossible dreams about this woman and make her more human, rather than a standard no real woman could ever live up to.<br /><br />I will continue reading the series to find out what happens, as I do think the story has potential. But, I have no idea when I will feel recovered enough to start the second book, which, of course, is evenlonger (over 1000 pages). Length with purpose is one thing; length with lack of content for four hundred pages is quite another.urpose is one thing; length with lack of content for four hundred pages is quite another.

B004LKRR6U|5.0|I have grown up a huge Grace Kelly fan, from her movie through princess years, and when I first saw her doll collection by Barbie Collector in a catalog, wanted to get one of these dolls.  This one from \\"To Catch A Thief\\" is just gorgeous, in a beautiful box with backdrop of the hotel corridor where this blue evening gown scene was filmed, and most importantly, the doll is a spectacular likeness of Grace, the facial features are perfect, as is the slim body shape.  The dress is a lovely two toned blue that matches my living room colors, and will be proudly displayed on a tall bookshelf.  Even if you are not a doll collector (I am not) but you are a Grace Kelly fan, having one of her beautifully made dolls is a pleasant reminder of an elegant, regal lady.

B002QP145C|5.0|We students of World War II history often forget that while German was mopping up Poland, safe behind a non-aggression pact with Stalin, the USSR saw an opportunity to invade Finland, thinking to regain some territory populated by freedom-loving people who'd declared independence from Czarist Russia in 1917.<br /><br />Since Finland is still, well, FINLAND, you can probably derive the outcome.<br /><br />This movie is about THAT war.<br /><br />It starts in the Finn homeland as citizen soldiers are called up, leaving homes and families and loves behind them, and progresses to horrendous and seemingly futile battles as the small and ill-equipped Finn army faces down the Soviet might.<br /><br />\\"Saving Private Ryan\\"?  This beats it, for emotion, feelings of futility and of victory.  You can't look away from the screen because first, the action is realistic.  No gasoline explosions.  More dismemberment and bloodshed.  And second, subtitles.  The film's sound track is in Finnish.<br /><br />Short version:  Great movie.  Learn a bit of history you didn't know.
0307352145|5.0|I'm very surprised by how consumed I became with this book and how much it affected me.  In short, Susan Cain lays out the historical figures, historical events, biological and evolutionary research, and the differences (and similarities at times) between extroverts and introverts.  Ultimately, it is a statement that if you're an introvert, it's ok, or often even really good.<br /><br />This book is broken up into four sections:  The Extrovert Ideal, Your Biology, Your Self, Do All Cultures Have An Extrovert Ideal?, and How To Love, How To Work.  In Part One she discusses what brought about the extrovert ideal, beginning from the early 1900's, leading up to today with Tony Robbins and Harvard Business School.  While exploring it, she discusses while being the most extroverted doesn't necessarily lead to being the one with best ideas, giving multiple studies and case studies in support.  Likewise, in Part Two, she discussions the psychological and biological research regarding introversion, while in Part Three she discusses whether or not what we see in modern American culture is indicative of all cultures worldwide.  Finally, she discusses how to go about life as an introvert, including how to be extroverted at times.<br /><br />I'm an introvert.  I have been since a child and feel emotionally satisfied if I have a loving partner and maybe spend a little time in conversation each day.  I don't need much.  I'm in my thirties now, but as a teenager and twenty something I was often made to feel like something was wrong with me because I didn't want to go to clubs, play sports (even though I would play basketball for hours on end alone or with one or two friends), or go to places with large crowds of people.  I spent so much time feeling like so much was going on \\"out there\\" and I was missing out on life, when in reality I had a hard time accepting I just enjoyed reading, taking a walk, or spending time with one or two people.<br /><br />Ultimately, this book is for introverts to provide evidence there is nothing wrong with them.  There isn't.  I'm glad this book was written.  It shows that just because you're loud, outgoing, boisterous, or even arrogant, it doesn't mean you have the best ideas, the best logic, or the best research behind what you say.  It's usually the quiet person, sitting at home reading each night, that can inform you the most.
B004YEJGEO|4.0|This game makes use of simple mechanics to make an excellent puzzle game. I'll admit I don't understand the scoring system, but that hasn't stopped me from playing the heck out of it. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Multiple solutions<br />-No time limits<br />-Problem solving<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Sound is quite  bland and skip-able<br />-Sometimes the screen sensitivity is variable, especially when changing colors in prisms.

0385534639|3.0|Like many others reviewing \\"The Night Circus\\", it was the hype that first drew my attention. Talk all over the internet, a huge display case in the local bookshop, rumors of a movie deal mere months after it had been published - I thought I'd may as well give in to the inevitable and read it.<br /><br />In my opinion, every good book requires three things: 1) rich, vivid world-building, 2) a story that captivates the reader, and 3) interesting, three-dimensional characters with equally interesting, complex relationships. Naturally, this is something of a generalization, and obviously not every good book is going to contain all these qualities to the same degree. Some may be missing one of these aspects entirely, but can make up for it on the strength of the other two. Others can utilize all three factors, but only adequately, or manage to capture one so brilliantly that nothing else is necessary. And so on.<br /><br />But for the purposes of this review, let's pretend that this three-pronged approach to storytelling is an infallible method of crafting a decent novel - in which case Erin Morgenstern's \\"The Night Circus\\" excels in one area, is pretty good in the other, but stumbles on the third.<br /><br />The draw-card of \\"The Night Circus\\" is (naturally) the circus itself. The Cirque des Reves, or \\"the Circus of Dreams\\" is a gloriously imaginative creation and a dream-like experience to both readers and characters. Beautifully designed and described in prose that only occasionally turns a shade of purple, this is a circus that arrives unexpectedly in the night, consists of dozens of tents in the shapes of pyramids, is entirely monochromatic in color, and opens only once the sun goes down. Visitors enter through the gate and are free to wander the circular paths to discover the secrets that the tents hold. Every impression is captured: the sights, the smells, the sounds - Morgenstern has crafted a fully immersive reading experience.<br /><br />Within this setting of a magical circus is the story itself, though it always feels secondary to the world that Morgenstern has created in which to *tell* that story.<br /><br />The stage magician Hector Bowen (who uses the ironic stage name Prospero, though he's about as far from Shakespeare's devoted father and wise magician as you can imagine) returns backstage from a performance to find that his hitherto unknown daughter has just been delivered to his door, her mother's suicide note pinned to her jacket. His initial reaction to her is not promising, but his interest is raised when she displays telekinetic powers.<br /><br />Enter Alexander H, an old friend/foe of Hector, who is usually referred to as the man in the grey suit. He proposes a wager, and judging from their conversation, this is neither the first nor the last time that the two men have played such a game. The exact reason behind the wager is unclear, but it seems to have something to do with each man trying to prove the superiority of their magic and teaching methods. The competitors in this game are to be their own prot&eacute;g&eacute;es: for Hector, it is his daughter Celia, for Alexander, it is Marko, a young boy he plucks out of an orphanage. Neither child knows the rules, they don't know how to win or when they'll win, and they don't even know who their opponent is. Readers who are feeling generous could call this a metaphor for life; others may think it's just an easy excuse to create the plot.<br /><br />Only one thing is clear: the Night Circus is the venue. As each child grows into adulthood, each one goes through a traumatizing learning regime under their guardians, who control practically every aspect of their lives. By the time the circus opens, the two are fairly evenly matched: Celia has natural talent but little discipline, while Marko is rigorously pedantic, but lacks Celia's raw power. The competition begins, and the beauty and magic of the circus grows with each move they make, gradually drawing closer to one another as they construct the sideshows and attractions that surround them.<br /><br />Divided into five parts of varying lengths, the narrative leaps back and forth in time between the 1880s and the 1890s, and is told entirely in present-tense, the immediacy of which can get a little tiring after a while. Furthermore, certain segments address the reader directly, recounting the various experiences that one might expect in the Night Circus: \\"You are amongst the crowd, of course. Your curiosity got the better of you, as curiosity is wont to do. You stand in the fading light, the scarf around your neck pulled up against the chilly evening breeze, waiting to see for yourself exactly what kind of circus only opens once the sun sets.\\"<br /><br />But a question hangs over the proceedings: when does the contest end? How is the winner decided? And what consequences await the loser? This brings us to the third quality of any decent story: the characters, who make up the heart of almost every novel - and here's where \\"The Night Circus\\" fails.<br /><br />Celia and Marko are two of the blandest, most uninteresting protagonists imaginable - and that's a pretty astonishing feat given the richness of their surroundings and the dangers of the competition that they're embroiled in. Any other character in the story, from the circus patrons to the performers, are more interesting than these two. As a result, their relationships suffer as well. The reader is given absolutely no reason to invest in the wishy-washy love story, for the two barely interact before we're lead to believe that they can't live without each other.<br /><br />Other relationships, which contained the potential for conflict that could have been riveting, fall flat as well. Though Morgenstern gets some mileage out of Celia and Hector's strained father/daughter bond, there is nothing on the Marko/Alexander front, and neither child seems particularly phased by the years of neglect and abuse they suffered. Marko starts a relationship with a young tarot reader called Isobel; she later joins the circus in order to spy on Celia for Marko's benefit, but her thoughts and feelings concerning this matter (and the heartless way in which Marko treats her) is never really explored.<br /><br />A past competitor is revealed to be working in the circus, fully aware of the new contest, but no insight is given on this potentially fascinating perspective either. We never learn the reason for the rivalry between Hector and Alexander, nor the background to their animosity. A boy called Bailey becomes captivated by the circus and has an important part to play in its fate; yet his obsession with the Night Circus feels perfunctory, more a plot-device than a character trait, and his involvement in the denouement feels more of a deus ex machina than an organic choice driven out of real passion for the circus.<br /><br />It all seems a dreadful waste. No one in the book feels like a real human being - they're all as distant and insubstantial as the circus itself. It's a pity; as their personalities and relationships could have held the necessary grit and realism to ground the dreamy circus atmosphere. A story that relies almost entirely on a mysterious competition that no one can fully understand *needed* strong characters to carry it - otherwise, nothing is at stake. Without characters to invest in, it's difficult to care about the resolution.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading \\"The Night Circus\\". I liked the central conceit and for the most part I liked the execution. But I never found it riveting. I could put the book down for breaks and not feel an urgent need to return to it. Reading it was like eating candy floss: sweet and tasty while it lasted, but dissolving almost instantaneously. Apparently the rights to the books have already been sold to Hollywood, in which case movie-goers are in for a visual feast when the story is adapted for the big screen. Until then, I just wish that the characters were worthy of the fantastical setting and the intriguing plot - which would have been all the more rewarding had the players in it not been so superficial.<br /><br />Five stars for the world-building, three stars for the plot, and one star for the characters.ko's benefit, but her thoughts and feelings concerning this matter (and the heartless way in which Marko treats her) is never really explored.

Gratitude for the joy that her recordings have given me through the years, but with the sadness that she's been taken from us too soon!<br />What is really fascinating and moving to me is the realization that I took her beautiful voice for granted for so long....it's almost like I'm listening to all of these songs for the very first time and I mean REALLY listening and hearing that rich, rich tone and marvelous range she possessed!<br />The lineup of songs is perfect for those of us who are already fans and for a younger generation who are just getting acquainted with her music!<br />Almost all of these songs bring back fond memories of people, places, and events in my life....Thank You For That and R.I.P. Whitney!!!
B000G8NY4U|5.0|Worth the money. Yanni is known to be a perfectionist and he ensures that each of his 200 odd musicians play it to the T, but in this video, the viewer gets a very up-close feel of how exactly each musician responds to the great maestro's cues and how wonderfully all of them come in sync together to produce some of the most fantastic music the world has ever heard.

B00006F7S4|5.0|The editorial review has to be some of the worst tripe I have ever read. I agree with what others have said about it, and couldn't state it better. I have been a Beck fan since around 1998 or so, when I was barely old enough to remember his music, listening to stuff like Odelay and later Midnite Vultures. It wasn't until 2008 or so that I rediscovered Beck and found this gem of a CD. I dare say it's one of, if not my favourite CD made since 2000. This album is quite possibly even my favourite album of all time. Beck is a master in this album at capturing his mood and his life and delivering a slice of it to us in audio form. This CD was not meant to be a happy one, and this seemed to have flown right over Hughes' head. When I think of music I like from just about any band, it always pales in comparison to this album. This isn't even an album--it's a masterful work of art.

B006UG90RM|4.0|I was going to rate this 2.5 stars,the avg of the 4 star music and  and 1 for the abysmal production or lack thereof. I just cant bring myslef to do that however because this is a such a fun cd to listen to. Do not base your decision to buy this on Tatoo. That is the only bad song on here and that is really bad. This cd just cooks and I dare you to not have a smile on you face while listening. Sorry to say that Van halen just sound more like themselves without Sammy in the band

B005I6EU7U|3.0|When I first saw this one I liked it because it had a different look. It was for my Kindle Fire.  When I first got the product - I put the fire in the sleeve and was a little dissappointed on the way it closed.  It advertised that it was for the fire but it didn't fit right. It left about an inch open.  The other issue was the cover had a substance on it that burned so make sure you clean it if you choose to buy this product. A few weeks later the cover finally closed.  It probably needed to be broken in like a pair of shoes.  The substance dissappeared after I cleaned it a few times. In the end this sleeve looks very nice and after all the issues cleared up I really like it.  I also had many compliments.  Most people have not seen a sleeve like this.

1451648537|5.0|I would not have been considered as part of the `target market' for Walter Isaacson's new biography of Steve Jobs. I knew very little about Jobs. I am at best a point and click MicroSoft computer user and really only have a vague idea of what an operating system is.<br /><br />I began reading this book because over the last 4 years, I have been told I look like Steve Jobs, maybe a hundred times. I was actually pulled out of line by the TSA last year at Seattle-Tacoma Airport and brought through a special line. I thought I was going to be searched but as I was walking through, the TSA agent said, \\"I am praying for you, Mr. Jobs.\\" I laughed and told him I appreciate the prayers but I was not Mr. Jobs. He then asked to see my license. He didn't believe me.<br /><br />I have worn black turtlenecks for years. I didn't know Jobs wore them. I hate to shave, so usually have a face full of stubble. I only pull out a razor when I am speaking (I am an author and professional speaker) or have a \\"suit and tie\\" business meeting. I began wearing glasses full-time in 2008 and the mistaken identity began almost immediately. My only other connection to the man is that I love my iPhone.<br /><br />The publicity surrounding his death increased the \\"do you know who you look like?\\" questions by ten times. During a recent walk through Midway Airport in Chicago, the young lady at the ticket counter said, \\"I know everyone must tell you that you look like Steve jobs, right?\\" As I walked to security, the TSA agent looked at me and asked if I was a celebrity impersonator. I said \\"No, but I do get mistaken for John Wayne often.\\" Then, as I loaded into the Southwest flight, one of the flight attendants was looking at me and walked up with her copy of the book and held it up to my face and asked, \\"Are you trying to look like him?\\" I assured her I was not. I then told her that I bet Steve was often mistaken for me. She looked at me and responded, \\"Nah.\\"<br /><br />So when I landed in Dallas, I downloaded this book on my new Kindle and the unexpected happened - I was mesmerized. People will say in reviews, as a standard line, \\"I could not put this book down.\\" We all know they certainly were able to put it down ... but never in my life have I been so captivated by a book.<br /><br />Walter Isaacson has performed an incredible service in his skillfully writtten examination of a life. It is structured perfectly, flows beautifully and is a brutally honest look at a brilliant man who will become a colorful part of our cultural history. Through most of this story, I did not like Steve Jobs but tolerated his arrogance and rudeness as part of what makes this story great.  Then came the point in the book where I realized it is not arrogance if it is true and I believe Steve Jobs to be a genius.<br /><br />I feel sorry for those who loved and respected him but suffered his wrath and continued to do so because of their loyalty to him and the \\"Apple Idea.\\" I despise him for the rejection and denial of his first daughter and know she will suffer for the rest of her life because of both his actions and inactions. I feel sorry for him because of the joy his daughter could have brought to his earlier life, that he chose to miss. Yes, he tried to make up for it later, but I think those are the kinds of losses that can never be regained.<br /><br />As the book progressed, I still did not like him, but the tremendous respect I felt for his accomplishments and intellect blossomed. Steve Jobs is the most interesting human being I have ever encountered, even though my only introductions are through this book ... and being occasionally misidentified as him. However, Walter Isaacson's skillful masterpiece is more than enough. Through Isaacson's insightful eyes and his carefully chosen and crafted words, I feel I have personally met a man that will be remembered as an American icon and revered for generations to come. Through this book, I witnessed a combination of his genius and severe personality defects in a way that displayed, what I believe is, a complete picture of Steve Jobs.<br /><br />When I began reading this book, the LAST thing I ever expected to say was this ...<br /><br />\\"This is the best book I have ever read. Period.\\"<br /><br />Go figure ... I would have never guessed.complete picture of Steve Jobs.  When I began reading this book, the LAST thing I ever expected to say was this ...  \\"This is the best book I have ever read. Period.\\"  Go figure ... I would have never guessed.

B006362ZR6|5.0|This album is above good. Most bands fail within their second album, but The Fray created another awesome cd.. And by the way not all the songs are about love like some previous reviewers claimed, in fact maybe about 2 songs in the full album are about it.. So before people come and ruin the ratings on this album they should do their research first, the Fray explained where the songs came from in their interviews.. So overall, this is one of my favorite albums and bands!!

Admittedly,some of the re-hash is pretty entertaining, but the ooze that creeps from the flop-slip/fish-wrap(hip-hop/rap) side is ALL so blatantly copy of previous eras in the music industry and the sheep just keep fallin for it!!! Come on King Kayne- sampling King Crimson and Mike Oldfield like no one has ever heard where these samples came from,this is NOT genius!!! Like Beasty Bois and all the like!! and putting a thousand other electronic sounds in to cover the fact that you can't play an instrument;Oh but I got me a tat even though I dont do anything else but watch Mindless Tv and eat junk food!!!

1451627289|4.0|I'm certainly not a King fan.  I've avoided his books for over 20 years because I found them to be long-winded, trite, and usually extremely shallow.  I decided to read this book because it is not your average Stephen King book.  It dealt with a topic I was interested in (JFK's assassination) in a genre I like (Time Travel).  Now, this book is about twice as long as it needed to be, and, like most King books, takes pages to say what ought to take paragraphs.  I hate that about King books, and I hated it about this book.  But, the story was interesting and held my interest, even when almost 300 pages were spent on a portion of the story that was entirely unnecessary to the overall plot.  Overall, I would recommend it to those who are interested in Time Travel.  Maybe it'll be another 20 years before I read another King novel, but I'm glad I read this one.
B0070Z4M4I|4.0|This movie is a prequel to Carpenter's film, though it, smartly, stays in safe \\"remake\\" territory. There is enough different to keep you interested and enough the same to make you feel comfortable. The director does a fantastic job building the sense of paranoia, which is so essential for this to work. Solid FX and performances.

The set was in great condition and the episodes were excellent.  If I had any criticism at all it would be a lack of special material on all of the disks.

B004ZZITEU|5.0|Everywhere I clicked; people were crying about the album as if it had caused global warming and started a war. After listening to the album on youtube, I bought the album as an mp3 download. The more I listened to it, the more I liked it. Now I'm really digging it. Do I like every song? No... I don't. Being a semi professional musician helped me appreciate this album, as there were several new approaches that no one has covered before. There have been very few albums that all the songs were hits and this album isn't any different. Drum Triggers? Who cares? It's about time the drummers were heard. Isn't it amazing that we as a society can only find a paragraph to compliment something and yet it takes us three or four paragraphs to sit and snivel about something? Jeez have we really become such whiners and bigots?<br />I REALLY like this album!
B004L35GAQ|1.0|Hello I'm I'm a close minded little pop lover and I HATED THIS ALBUM. I LOVED SAIL and no other song sounded like it so i hated it. 0/5 cus i like sail so much and everything else sucks on the album. Hur de hurr  Now that my point has been made, I would like to say I really don't get how people disliked this album, 6/5, and my favorite by far was KNIGHTS OF SHAME. yea i said it, many people disliked it, but in my view it,s the best on the album! it was almost beautiful in a sense. Don't listen to people who hated the album because their precious sail wasn't repeated in another song. I seriously didn't dislike one song on it. I'm so glad bands like this exist, bands that are capable of making EVERY SONG on an album incredible!

B004RFYEEC|5.0|Only 45 years late, we now get Brian Wilson's original 1966-67 sessions for this long-lost album, which fans know was completed by Brian and Van Dyke Parks with Brian's own band in 2004. The first disc recreates what might have been a finished running order for a January 1967 Smile, using Brian's 2004 version as a template. Yes there are some startling variations, but mostly this shows the project was closer to completion than you might think. Though to assemble the jumble of tape reels coherently required CoolEditPro digital editing -- a tool not around in 1967.  No wonder Brian couldn't finish it then - he didn't have the technology. Missing pieces from 1966 are found and, where possible, flown into place to fill spots where Brian added them in his 2004 completion.  But listen to the sessions, all of them more fascinating than you would think, as Brian coaches the boys and directs the musicians into more bizarre groupings as new ideas hit him.  Hear Smile morph into the sounds of Smiley Smile as the sessions progress! The 5-disc set with 2-LP's and 2-45 singles contains many cool treasures.  But most folks will get what they need from the 2-disc reduced set, which has most of the good stuff.  By the way, the vinyl sounds GORGEOUS
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Admittedly, I had not even heard of Lana Del Rey until I saw that critics were panning her SNL performance. I guess there really is no such thing as bad press since I may have never heard of her otherwise. I proceeded to watch the TV clips myself and thought that she did not do anything special. It was not a great performance by any measure, she was off key often and did not put up much of a show but it was far from the worst performance ever as some people were quick to proclaim. I then went to check out her first single, Video Games, which I thought to be quite an intriguing song with a fitting video. So I thought I'd give her album a shot even though I wasn't expecting much with her being a new artist and only hearing one of her songs. After all, one hit wonder artists are a dime a dozen in this day and age.  I'll tell you what, I was surprised at how much I liked it at first listen. After spinning it a few more times and numerous plays since then I have to conclude that this is a great album with no filler. Some songs are better than others, of course, but I think every song on the album works well while remaining cohesive. Is it a perfect album? No. But it's still pretty damn fun to listen to.  I can see this album appealing to a lot of different musical tastes. I hear elements in her vocals of Nancy Sinatra/Fiona Apple/Adele and even Michael Buble/Matt Dusk that give her a rather unique sound in today's music scene. The production on this album really shines and can appeal to older fans of the Sinatra-sound, younger lovers of Lady Gaga pop as well as the R&B and hip-hop crowds. Emile, the executive producer, worked with Kanye West on his acclaimed latest album and was responsible for Kid Cudi's amazing debut. He and the rest of the team proceed in similar fashion to create a mood that is mesmerizing. Lyrically, the dominant themes express melancholy, nostalgia, glamour and materialism - she captures the noir feel effectively. Consequently, there are a lot of thematic similarities to the outstanding House of Balloons trilogy by The Weeknd, probably the most intriguing new artist of the past year.  As for the critics that have given negative reviews of this release, I think they have let one performance on TV influence them into speaking ill of this newcomer despite her actual music. I have read about her changing her name and image and whatever else but, frankly, none of that talk concerns me at all whether true or not. All I care about is quality of the music and this album is thoroughly enjoyable. Lana may need to work on her live performance if she wants to sell concert tickets but as long as she can put out recordings this good I'm on board to buy her albums. 4.5 stars overall.

B006UG90RM|5.0|After the long wait the real Van Halen is back, even if it is without Michael Anthony. I'm not going to go into a song breakdown, or comparing the music to anything in the past because none of that matters when you listen to this record. The only thing that matters is this album rocks and is blast, from beginning to end. They have pulled off not only an amazing comeback, they made a complete record with not a bad song.  It's just balls to the wall good fun rock and roll like is meant to be played. This record has reminded me why I feel in love with VH from the moment I heard the the opening guitar on Running with the Devil, yes this record is that good. As a matter of fact I really can't explain to someone who has not listened to this record just how good it is, except to say if your a Van Halen fan, a true Van halen fan you have to purchase and listen to this amazing record immediately, it was created for you. It will bring a smile to your face and bring you to a simpler time when rock was fun. I just want to say thank you to the boys for a great effort. I will be enjoying this record for a long time.

B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Back when I was your age, when we wanted to know what the phase of the moon was, we had to look out the window! Ha ha. I love this brilliantly-constructed and informative app.<br /><br />When you first open it, you're treated to a high-definition image of the moon as it appears from your location, displaying the correct phase, moon face, and phase shadow angle. To accomplish that, the app uses either your coarse or fine (GPS) location. That alone is pretty cool, but there's much more to this app than just that. Slide your finger left and right across the screen, and the moon changes phases, displaying the date and time it will be at that phase. The displayed Moon even rotates accordingly.<br /><br />There is an available information screen that provides all sorts of information about the current Moon, including altitude, azimuth, right ascension, declination, distance, dates of apogee and perigee, and Moon rise and set times and compass locations.<br /><br />Using two fingers, you can take full command of our closest astronomical neighbor, spinning it around to see every part of it, including of course the incorrectly-named \\"dark side\\" that we poor earthbound saps never get to see.<br /><br />With one finger press, you can also alternate between the next full- and new-moon displays, with the number of days and hours until those occurrences happen displayed with the image.<br /><br />You can also set this app to permanently display the current Moon as a live wallpaper.<br />Clicking your device's \\"back\\" button re-orients the moon display to the current proper phase and orientation for your location.<br /><br />You can also input any date you wish to see what the Moon looked like on that date. On the day I was born almost 50 years ago, the Moon was 62% full (waning gibbous). Cool!<br /><br />You can also pop up a calendar-style graphic that shows a mini-photo of the Moon for every day of the current month (you can see any month by swiping the display or pressing forward and reverse icons). pressing on a calendar day adjusts the main display to that day's Moon appearance.<br /><br />This is an amazingly informative and very entertaining app. Well thought-out and the professional-level user interface is clean, logical and uncluttered. Even if it may not have much practical value in my everyday life, for 99 cents I still think it was well worth it.rd and reverse icons). pressing on a calendar day adjusts the main display to that day's Moon appearance.<br /><br />This is an amazingly informative and very entertaining app. Well thought-out and the professional-level user interface is clean, logical and uncluttered.

B000JMLFLW|4.0|I can understand why this is considered a classic of literature.  I saw the movie first and then just read it. The story is more for women, I think, but I confess I got into the drama once Darcy and Elizabeth started interacting. I could have done without some (or all) of the sisters, but I guess they were an essential part of the novel to show what silly girls were like in those days.
B000002J1Y|5.0|Simply put, this masterpiece defined my high school years. I didn't know that this was \\"progressive rock\\", I just knew it was incredibly unique and imaginative music. Yes was a group that went their own way, and their unique creative genius shines in every track of this album. I pretty much wore out the grooves on the triple-LP I had bought from Columbia Record Club.<br /><br />This album has it all - from up-close and intimate acoustic pieces (\\"Mood for a Day\\") to the soaring and uplifting \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" to the sweeping, fantastical synth-orchestral pomposity of \\"And You And I\\", which remains to this day my all-time favorite \\"Yes\\" composition. Most people have heard \\"Roundabout\\" on classic rock stations, but they really don't know the flavor of quintessential Yes unless they have listened to this stunning collection of live material.<br /><br />This album excels at sweeping you into a magical fantasy land where anything seems possible, and it doesn't even matter that most of the lyrics make absolutely no sense at all. Rick Wakeman's brilliant and bizarre keyboard solo, \\"Excerpts from The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\", is a marvel of showmanship and a perfect showcasing of Wakeman's mad genius. By the time he takes you through this seamless blending of many different musical styles and you arrive at the finale, you realize you're breathless... and then it perfectly segues into the classic \\"Roundabout\\".<br /><br />The recording itself is of mediocre quality. It's wispy and rough around the edges, far from the slickly-produced sound in common in live albums today. It's not even up to par with other live albums of its time. But this does not matter in the least. To me, anyway, the relatively poor recording quality actually enhances the album in ways I can't put into words. I couldn't imagine it being recorded any other way.<br /><br />If your only experience with Yes is their later mainstream claptrap like the 80s album \\"90215\\", you owe it to yourself to listen to them when they were at the height of their artistic powers. In other words, get this album!hem when they were at the height of their artistic powers. In other words, get this album!

B001MW0J2Y|5.0|This is one of the most moving, beautiful albums I have ever owned.  Although I had been a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan since I first heard Frusciante's opening riff for \\"Under the Bridge,\\" I never ventured to pursue his solo work, until this album.  I have always felt that there was something lacking in his guitar work on all the subsequent Chili Peppers albums after Blood Sugar Sex Magik.  It was always skilled, pleasant to listen to, but not very soulful or blusey.  All the soul you hear in Blood Sugar Sex Magik is present in this album.  It takes a very different form, however.  It's less \\"accessable\\" than most Chili peppers albums.  It took a few listens to truly grow on me.  I didn't like the sound of his voice at first.  \\"Why can't this all just be instrumental?\\", I thought.  His singing is very different than what most people look for in alternative rock.  It's very vulnerable, not so polished, and you can barely recognize the same rock-n-roll tone as you hear throughout RHCP's vocals.  The vulnerable emotion and the meaning of these beautiful, religious lyrics come across more authentically in the Empyrean's vocal track than anything that's normally heard in top 40 hits.  It reminds me a little of James Blunt or possibly Adele, only instead of being sappy, the emotion is deeply philosophical, sad, and vulnerable.  After 4 or 5 listens, the album's now brought tears to my eyes, which isn't something I can say for more than one or two other albums that I have ever owned.  I certainly didn't expect this sort of emotional reaction when I purchased the disc...  I think that it's a real gem.  If you're a fan of Frusciante's guitar work in RHCP, at least give it a try.  Give it at least three listens before passing judgment.  Read the lyrics.  You won't regret it.  Wow.
B005ISQ7JM|1.0|There are a couple things here that are helpful.  Generally speaking it was a waste of time.  The author really likes being able to leverage other people's content and to have it more neatly arranged.  He makes you aware of the \\"Canvas\\", which is interesting...  Honestly the rest was a bunch of kumbaya, \\"write your stuff expecting it to be leveraged, and expect to leverage / steal the work of others.  To write a monolithic website is dumb and selfish.\\"  Borrowing stuff from all over the web \\"real time\\" in the way the author suggests will eventually result in a maintenance nightmare.

B004DLPXAO|4.0|This app is great for reading novels and I have had no issues with that. However, it's not so great for reading textbooks. I recently downloaded a textbook because it was cheaper and easier to carry my tablet when I want to read it than lug around a textbook. The problem is that I do not have the capability to highlight or take notes. I have found some ereaders that allow this capability, but unfornuately I cannot use it for any books downloaded from Amazon.
B0026QBKQE|5.0|As far as I can tell this was never released in the US on DVD. I purchased the soundtrack years ago but could never find a DVD (only VHS tape). *HOWEVER* if you have a copy of SlySoft AnyDVD and a DVD player on your computer it plays back beautifully.  The sound is only 2 channel stereo (no surround) but the video on the disk IS in widescreeen 16x9 format which was a pleasant surprise. The only time I ever saw this was at home on HBO back in the 80s - thus it was 4x3 format back then...
B0073PQ720|5.0|A sleek film that already so much has been said about. Heard A LOT of hype while this film was in theaters and was hesitant to give it a shot but boy am I glad I did. It's one of those movies you either have to laugh at the ridiculousness of some of the violence or squirm from squeamishness (I found myself laughing throughout the film).  Ryan Gosling does an excellent job playing a man who \\"drives\\", but also does so much more.  As others have mentioned Gosling deserves a Best Actor nod for playing a somewhat sociopathic man but ends up displaying selfless behavior for his neighbor and son. His ability to \\"flip the switch\\" from mechanic to driver are frighteningly effective in this film, all one needs to see is the elevator scene to realize the capabilities of Gosling in this film. Should have been a best actor nod based on the performances of the other nominees.  Despite other reviewers comments (which I can understand), I personally felt the pace of the film was perfect for the premise of the film and the soundtrack matched. The score should be nominated if it was actually based on how well the film fit the movie. While the non-driving scenes were slower than most modern films, it built the anticipation for the driving and blood and guts scenes. These driving scenes are some of the best since Ronin, French Connection, and Bullitt but so much sexier with the Clippers game in the background, and the music to match. Albert Brooks does a great job in his supporting role and have received a nomination as well.  While this was not a nominee for best picture (and I do not think it should have been), I do think the performances throughout made this one of the more enjoyable films of 2011. So if you are looking for an entertaining, violent, at times disturbing but thoroughly enjoyable film I urge you to watch Drive. It will leave you wanting to ditch your foreign mobile and go for a \\"real drive\\".

B0042EJD8A|5.0|I happened upon GASLAND on HBO more than a year ago, and found it fascinating.  The movie is interesting, compelling, entertaining.  I've watched it 3 times.  Josh Fox is a true American patriot, in my book, for tackling this serious subject and singlehandedly making the word Fracking familiar to every American.  I highly recommend this Academy Award nominated documentary, which shows that the urgency of dealing with the destructiveness of hydraulic fracturing is not only a critical environmental mandate, but a human tale, destined to be told.
B00422LESO|4.0|I am a huge Austen fan. I haven't even gotten around to reading all of her work yet (I will very soon!) but she's one of my favourites. I will probably pick up anything with Austen's name on it and thankfully there are lots of spin offs out there! Some better than others, of course. I think Austenland was definitely one of the better ones. I think it managed to find its own unique style instead of trying to strive to be as Austen-like as possible.  Jane Hayes has a secret obsession: Pride and Prejudice. She is obsessed with it to the point of it hindering her life. For Jane, nothing in the real world ever lives up to what she sees as the idyllic life of Elizabeth Bennet. When her aunt dies, she leaves Jane something rather unusual in her will. Jane gets to visit a place that imitates Austen's time period and consists of actors roleplaying as various characters. I loved this idea and was interested to see where it would go. From the minute Jane steps in to this place, it's obvious that's it's not really her kind of thing and that she's not going to have such an easy time acting out the life she's been wishing for all these years.  I thought the idea was well executed and I really enjoyed Jane's stay at the resort. I found that even I was fooled several times over who was acting and who was real! I can't imagine how weird it would have felt to be Jane. She couldn't do the acting thing but kept forgetting that everybody else could. I found a lot of the interactions of the characters really entertaining and overall, the book was a pleasure to read. It did get a bit stale at parts with too much description and not enough talking or events but other than that, I really enjoyed it and I'm really looking forward to the second book, Midnight in Austenland!

0380713802|1.0|Having read five of Bill Bryson's books (including the excellent, \\"A Walk in the Woods\\"), I was looking forward to this book.  I traveled to Europe and Africa in 1971 for nearly six months when everyone was carrying the book \\"Europe on $5 a Day.\\"  I followed up with a short trip back to Europe in 1985 and then again many times years later.  I was very interested in reading this book, since I had been to all the places Bill was writing about. e.g., even Sofia and Istanbul.  This book was a major disapointment.  Not very informative, interesting or FUNNY!  There were some interesting facts, but usually just whinning and comments about how lousy a time he was having and all the unpleasant and unattractive people he encountered.  I am sure all this was designed to make the book more readable and humorous, but I found practically nothing funny in this book.  I guess you bomb out on a book every once and a while.  Bryson appeared to be a self-centered, pissed off, ugly American traveler--the very ones he hated and mocked in his book.

1451648537|5.0|Just finished reading \\"Steve Jobs\\" by Walter Isaacson. I should say that the whole book was very STEVE. There was simplicity and orderliness in the storytelling of Steve's life in this book. You can truly compare the main characteristics of Apple products to it - simple, easy to understand and powerful. The author mentioned also how Steve \\"controlled\\" the production of the book, from the cover, to the font, to the look of the inside pages, and photos to use. If Steve was not a very interesting figure then I don't think this book would be worth reading. Isaacson may not be the best writer, but the story and topic were one of the best  - that's why the book is a bestseller up to this point in time. He told Steve's life in \\"universal\\" English - given the fact that he has been with CNN and TIME, so he has that \\"reporter's way of delivery\\". Steve was definitely one of the most difficult persons to ever walked this planet as you read the book, but a genius, a VISIONARY that had transformed the landscape of computing technology. He may had been super \\"mean\\" for most times in his life but he said he wanted to leave a legacy for mankind - although many would consider that for an open discussion as to Apple itself as a legacy. Although he was not so fond of philantrophy, but the book made me discover how we can change the world while we are still alive - and that we should not live other people's lives. Think Different. I highly recommend this book.

B006W0QOF2|1.0|An extremely slow movie.  The first scene is quite refreshing and entertaining, but the whole thing just goes downhill from there.  The next half hour is useless.  After that the pace slowly picks up as there are a couple scenes of disturbing and graphic violence.  But I wanted to see some chase scenes. There were none.  To me it has a Miami Vice feel (another movie I hated).  It was a movie that wanted to be fresh and cool, but ended up being extremely boring to me.

B006TLFPKO|3.0|First, I still like the Twilight movie franchise and have found it to be unique, powerful and romantic.  So far, though, Breaking Dawn Part 1 is my least favorite and that is because it appears rushed.  Instead of trying to drag out the franchise for dollar$ they probably should have combined Breaking Dawn Parts 1 & 2 into a 2.5 or 3 hr film.  While it may have been a bit long, as much as people love this series they would have made their way to the theatre through a hurricane no matter the personal cost to their lives and sat through a 3 hour movie.  I'm disappointed that the producers of Twilight decided to drag out the last two parts to the series (to capitalize on profit, I'm sure).<br /><br />As for content, it's a bit \\"lite\\" which is really saying something since all of the Twilight movies can be described that way by degrees - lol!  The most powerful part of the movie was definitely the birth of Renesmee (horrible choice for a name in a movie script) which was pretty grim and made me wince several times.  Other than that though, the wolf pow-wow where they speak to each other telepathically was kind of silly, the lead up to the wedding and the wedding itself was too fast, the dialog seemed much lighter than in the previous films, and I didn't walk away feeling quite as emotionally full as I had after viewing Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse.  Also, not sure what all the hype was about but the sex scene between Bella and Edward was really mild... nothing overtly graphic or extreme (maybe they altered and cut part of the scene?).<br /><br />Overall, I liked Breaking Dawn Part 1, but found it not to be in the full spirit of the first 3 movies.  We'll see what happens with part deux...
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Ordered the Marware cover with my Kindle Fire - they arrived together and the cover was put onto my Kindle Fire immediately.  I like the feel and flexibility of the cover - serves as a support stand and has an elastic strap to hold the cover open or closed.
B005LAIIRQ|3.0|The movie was NOT a survival movie, as there was not any surviving going on, just dying.  The landscape was gorgeous and was the best part of the movie.  The movie was more of a thriller than anything else with me jumping quite a few times while watching it.  I thought it might be like my all time favorite movie, The Edge, but it was nothing like this movie.  Also, the ending of the movie was terrible.  The movie was not terrible, but I would say the movie had a GREY mood for sure.  I went away from the theater feeling like I needed to watch a comedy to get the depression off me.

B0060ZJ78U|4.0|MOVIE RATING: 4.5 stars (A-)<br /><br />There's something about baseball. It just works on the silver screen. I'm not a big fan of watching baseball in person, or on TV, but it can really zing on a movie screen. Following last year's movie masterpiece The Social Network (2010), screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, and Moneyball co-screenwriter Steven Zaillian, have fashioned this year's crisply intelligent word game to where it almost felt like the sequel to the Facebook film. The same brilliance that brought the seemingly \\"boring\\" business of social media to epic Greek-Tragedy-life, now brings the business and statistics of baseball to that same place. While The Social Network is about invention, friendship, trust, and revenge, Moneyball is about ambition, courage, logic, and intuition. Both to a large extent are tales of underdogs, scrappily fighting their way to the top, reaching their goals however possible with limited resources.<br /><br />Up-and-coming film director Bennett Miller did an amazing job pulling this movie together and telling a great new story in a genre that is extremely tough to compete in: the sports movie. Not only is that genre crowded, the baseball sports movie sub-genre can easily fill 9 innings or more with good films: Field of Dreams (1989), Bull Durham (1988), The Natural (1984), Eight Men Out (1988), A League of Their Own (1992), Major League (1989), The Bad News Bears (1976), The Rookie (2002), and 61* (2001). While Moneyball doesn't quite manage the extra greatness that I believe Field of Dreams, Hoosiers (1986), Days of Thunder (1990), and Rudy (1993) occupy as sports movies about underdogs, it does bring a lot to the table to trade with those films.<br /><br />To begin with, actors Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, and Philip Seymour Hoffman really brought their A-games to the Oakland A's. Some might argue that Hoffman's performance as Art Howe is too subdued and that he has very little dialogue in the film. But the pure weight of his performance with his somber, quiet, old school heft really works for the character he's playing: a grizzled, set-in-his-ways baseball manager up against a younger fire-in-his-pants general manager. Pitt plays the GM, Billy Beane, who wants to shake things up and change the system that they've all worked in for years and years. Beane realizes that the system is broken and that the teams at the bottom with limited financial resources just can't compete against the teams at the top with much bigger budgets to spend on the best players in the game. It's this conceit that sets up the \\"risk it all\\" strategy that Pitt employs by hiring Jonah Hill's character Peter Brand, a Yale economics graduate whose never played a lick of baseball, to assist him in throwing the traditional baseball scouts on their asses by using logic and statistics instead of popularity, gut instincts, and experience to pick players and create the team with.<br /><br />I think the strongest asset in this underdog story is the battle between logic and intuition. It's a classic philosophical debate in every \\"game\\" or endeavor in life. And while some might argue that Moneyball's Beane proves to a degree that logic rules over intuition, I think he's really just trying to bring logic back into the game to play alongside intuition. Babe Ruth, arguably the greatest baseball player of all time, doesn't exactly scream \\"great athlete\\" in terms of his physical prowess and athleticism by today's standards. You wouldn't see a scout pick a player that looks and acts like Ruth today. But his statistics don't lie. And Beane is simply trying to combine intuition, experience, and talent with statistics to show that sometimes a player might not look on the surface or by their book cover to be a good player, but if their statistics say otherwise, maybe they should be looked at more closely.<br /><br />The production design and cinematography in Moneyball are right up there with most great films coming out of Hollywood today. Neither overly stood out as exceptional to me, but they definitely aren't average either. There's a realism and \\"documentary\\" style to the way Moneyball looks and feels. Pitt's hair and costumes are more average joe, helping portray his character as anything but the sexiest-man-alive movie star that Pitt normally plays. He's a father, an ex-husband, and a general manager. It's actually kind of refreshing to see no love interest or romance for the leading man in a movie. We tend to fantasize and dream that we can have it all in the movies: love, career, family, sex, etc. But in reality, lots of men and women who put so much of their passion into their careers, don't have the perfect personal lives we see on screen. I'm glad this movie didn't just stick in a sexy momma for Pitt's character to tango with. Pitt's love in Moneyball is the game of baseball. That's his mistress.<br /><br />There are a number of great, memorable scenes in Moneyball that I keep playing over and over in my head as I think about the film. Scenes from the various games, the stadium, and the locker room. Scenes in the meeting room between Pitt and the scouts. Scenes in the offices between Pitt and Hill. And scenes with Pitt all by himself. Moneyball's editing, led by Christopher Tellefsen, keeps the film moving most of the time at a good pace, with a few 7th inning slumps. But overall, I felt the film was just right. Some critics and viewers have said that Moneyball is too long and that it drags at times, but I found it engaging nearly the whole time. I can't remember ever looking at my watch. I was vested in the story and felt the stakes, wanting to see how it all played out.<br /><br />The score and music by Mychael Danna really worked for me, giving the film the deeper emotional connection that I wanted from it. And the sound department did an amazing job with their work, certainly challenged by some of the locations they had to record in. At some point I want to listen to Moneyball's score all on its own to really appreciate it. I have a feeling there's more to it than meets the eye.<br /><br />You can't go wrong in watching Moneyball. The intelligence, wit, emotion, and craft in this film should appeal on some level with just about everyone. Just like The Social Network is not really a movie just about Facebook, Moneyball is not really a movie just about baseball.

Maybe not. But remember, this is a kids movie .. If you wanted to see another movie you shouldn't have gone with your kids.
0060899220|5.0|I'm not actually that interested in line cooking. I picked this up more for its value as a commentary on a subculture that I knew little about. The subculture, of course, was the kitchens of Manhattan restaurants.<br /><br />Bourdain has a refreshingly acerbic wit mixed with complete irreverence for the restaurant industry. His write-up is both comic and insightful. And the overall impact of this gem of a book is now a host of imitators wanting to write their own confidential portraits of their occupational world.<br /><br />Bourdain was really the first to do this in such a spectacular fashion, though, and he remains one of the best. As bad boys go, Marco White probably has him beat, but Bourdain is just too much fun for anyone to bypass this book.
