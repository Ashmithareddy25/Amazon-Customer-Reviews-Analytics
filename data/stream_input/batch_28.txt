B00000I0XW|5.0|I just got this out from Decca.... I really like it!<br />I love the new versions of some songs....like Memory and Love Changes Everything (note : the music is the same from As I Came of Age, but her voice it different)
B00000IMCU|5.0|I Love this movie no matter where you put it. Trust me. I've must of seen it at least 500. Literally. People say that the music is corny and the zombies look horrible. But Tell me the truth, the first time you hear the  gong song during the credits it didnt stick in your head for 15 min, in  stuck in your head for 3 days. And the zombies look like regular Joe's and  i think if was any other way it would be trash. In my opinion, it gives it  a whole comedic look. Thats why i love this movie. <br />---Pimp Master  Funk.
6305268843|5.0|When I went to the video store to rent a movie I didn't realize when I rented this one how much I would like it.  I loved the setting and costumes and the main characters.  I would like to own it, but like others will wait  until the price drops.  I would definately like to see it again.
B00000J7S8|4.0|this is my third diana krall cd purchase in as many weeks. I'm hooked. the salute to the nat  cole trio is my favorite. this album though is the perfect blend of songs, stylist, arrangement,ensemble players, and  orchestra. neither over or understated.I look forward to seeing this fine  artist in concert.
067101756X|1.0|Okay, so this guy has rehashed the plot of the X-Files. That does not make it any more real.
6300151379|5.0|The first time I ever watched this movie was probably when I was 12 and I was in awe. Not only was this movie great, but this story was beautiful. It is a story that it's been told through the ages, evil king, brave girl,  girl saves day and everyone else. I now have the soundtrack for this  movie,but however you don't get to see the story you can hear it but you  don't get to see it. This movie is art it would be a shame not to have this  movie re-released; in my opinion you would be you robbing a generation of  this beautiful story and that would be sad. So please for the love of God  re-release the film!
0684867621|5.0|He did it again ! Stephen King knows kids and what scares most people. This time the moster is in our minds until we're half waythrough the book. Then the tension builds, while we wonder when the first  confrontation will  happen. The end is both suprising and exhilerating.
B000003PWZ|5.0|Instead of waiting for a representative American release of the early Animals stuff, I decided to try this import. I heartily recommend this compilation to US fans; it is a healthy two CD set, and all of it sounds  pretty much necessary (and great) if you are an Animals fan; you may even  (like me) discover some fabulous stuff of theirs you were never aware of;  it is wonderful and does not overlap the American best of their second half  of their career at all, so between them you have it pretty much covered  (okay, real fans may want to throw in the later wild stuff, Love Is, Every  One of Us, The Twain Shall Meet, etc.)
B000006NPY|3.0|Songs that are really memorable:<br />Ava Adore: awesome. Perfect: 1979 knockoff. Pug: good groove.<br />Songs that are pretty memorable:<br />To Sheila: minimal, folky. Daphne Descends: good drum part. Appels + Oranjes: ditto.  Behold! the Night Mare: eerie. For Martha: good guitar.<br />The rest of the  album is one big long forgettable song.  It's not a *bad* song, Corgan just  wrote it 8 times... and the &quot;pretty memorable&quot; songs have enough  similarities between them to make this record feel bland.<br />There is a  *LOT* of texture here -- strummed guitars, overdubbed vocals, some piano  and synths and gentle drum machines -- but none of this material is very  distinctive at all and the melodies are dull compared to earlier efforts.
6301963695|5.0|Its been along time since I have seen this movie, but when I did I thought it was pretty wild. I think I would like to see it again.
0440180295|5.0|People who read books only so they can listlessly write high school or college papers which receive mediocre grades don't understand great books and authors like Vonnegut. No doubt, if they don't understand Vonnegut,  they WON'T like Richard Brautigan.
B0000057C5|5.0|LOVE THIS CD!  Not in english, but the beat makes you want to pump iron.  Go RAMMSTEIN!
B00000J2KR|1.0|This is not only Kubrick's worst film, but possibly one of the worst films of all time.  Boring does not begin to describe it.  The movie would be much better off in an hour and a half version.  Don't waste your time!
0385312083|5.0|The meanings of this novel are far deeper than &quot;War is bad.&quot;  Just because a work of litureature contains scenes of horror in war does not mean that that is the only message there.  I highly reccomend this  novel and any other Vonnegut work.
B000006OAM|5.0|This whole album is great, but the song, &quot;My Skin&quot; may be my favorite song ever.  It starts slow and quite and builds to a haunting and wonderful melody with piano and cello, I think.  If this song doesnt move  you, you are DEAD!  Natalie Merchant is one of my favorite artists because  she bares her soul and she is extremely talented.  Great album!!!
B000002HRE|2.0|I've been a Metallica fan since Kill'em All.  They have put out some of the most memorable metal of the 80's through 1991.  Load completely left me out in the cold.  I couldn't believe my ears when I heard it.  How could  they do it?!  What utter garbage.  Reload wasn't much better.  It's just a  heavy version of Load, nothing more.  To be honest, some of the songs were  okay.  I personally thought Fuel was decent but I think &quot;Where the  Wild Things are&quot; is the best track on the entire album (strictly my  opinion).  Overall, the album is a dud from beginning to end, showing  little of the musical finesse and power that is evident in their previous  works.  Fortunately, I haven't bought this album or Load.  I borrowed it  from a friend first.  I wasn't going to waste money on something that could  be a major disappointment.  Turns out I was right.  I think I'll wait until  they get their collective act together before I buy any new original  material from them.  What a shame.
B00000JCB2|5.0|This is the best CD ever!  Nookie is the best song since Faith.  But why would someone stick a cookie up their ---?  Limp Bizkit Will Rule The World!!!!!!!!!!!!
6300270424|5.0|Jimmy Page literally spoke with his guitar, therefore I think there were two singers, Page and Plant..I think this concert has to be the wildest (musically) in the history of rock'n'roll on this planet. If u haven't seen  this video, u really haven't heard much of zeppelin yet, I mean it....
B00000BKDW|4.0|This is a great album! It will make you feel like you are in ancient Egypt. Probably the best artwork EVER!!! But the music is what really matters, and this one certainly delivers! Buy it now...before its too  late!!!! It makes me miss those days when I could sport a mullet with  pride!
0345404475|4.0|I was looking for a &quot;fun read&quot; on vacation and, being a fan of Blade Runner, thought I'd pick this up.  If you're looking for fidelity to the movie, never mind.  On the other hand, this turns out to be much more  interesting and cerebral than the movie attempted to be.  I'd call it a  piece of philosophical sci-fi, posing questions that -- sooner or later --  we'll have to confront.
B00000BKDV|5.0|Still Life is, in my opinion, the best song this band has ever written. To Tame a Land has got to be second. If you like your metal heavy and raucous, purchase this album. A great asset to any true metalhead. Revelations jams  as well!!! EDDIE LIVES!
B00000JGOH|5.0|This is what cinema should be. Amusing, romantic, humorous and intelligent.  The more Shakespeare you know, the more you will enjoy it.  And the bits that are genuine Shakespeare are well-acted, too. Gwyneth  Paltrow goes up a long way in my estimation after this.
B000000H5K|5.0|roots is the best album that sepultura ever had.i was surprised that they changed there sound. the second time when i listened my mind got blank for a  second and i said holy s*** this sounds just like the second korn album  life is peachy. its just like haven another korn life is peahy album but  another band. whne i heard that song lookaway i just caught who was makin  that growl sound in it and i realized it Johnathan davis. sepultura rules  man
0062511408|5.0|I really recommend this book to anyone. Paulo Coehlo really gets his message on how important things in life are forgotten by man and overshadowed by all kinds of social constructs and fears. A good book to  make you think about life.
0679420401|5.0|A remarkable story of the adverse livng conditions during the depression. The constant struggle for just enough to eat was truly a triumph over tragedy.Fortunately, few of us today will never encounter such  hardships.This novel should be required reading for those who think it's  tough going in todays world.
B0000062S0|5.0|I am a huge fan of Led Zeppelin, but I almost enjoy listening to this album straight through more than listening to most Zep albums straight through. I bought WIC a few days after it came out, with pretty high  expectations. I listened to it once and thought &quot;very good, but not  great.&quot; After a few more listens, I thought it was great and still do.  I listened to this album more in the first couple of weeks after buying it  than I have ever listened to any other album right after buying it.  &quot;Most High&quot; is a perfect song in the &quot;Kashmir&quot;  tradition, &quot;Blue Train&quot; is ideal for a melancholy mood and a  rainy day, &quot;Heart In Your Hand&quot; is one of the most beautifully  sensuous songs I have ever heard, and &quot;Shining in the Light,&quot; for  some reason I can't explain, almost moves me to tears. Those are the  highlights, but although some songs are considerably better than others  there really isn't a weak one on the CD. Robert Plant and Jimmy Page were  geniuses when they were in Led Zeppelin and they are still geniuses. Get  this one.
0380002930|5.0|I think that the author must've had one great talent to write this book. I've even seen the animated movie based on the book. I have seen the movie ever since I was 3 years old! I have always loved the book and movie at the  same time and I recommend it to everyone who really enjoys great  imagination! The movie may not be the same from the book in some parts of  it but it does touch your heart in many ways than you can ever think of!
0767817478|1.0|Just plain bad idea. The film makers obviously thought they were updating a classic but unfortunately captured none of the original spirit. That would have been OK if the movie had turned out to be good at what it was  but, alas, it was not even a good special effects monster action movie.
078322706X|5.0|It was great, very touching
B00000J7S8|5.0|I began listening to Diana Krall in earnest about a year ago. I bought up the meager supply of her recordings and fell in love with that sultry voice. I yearned for more. And then I got to watch her perform in Oakland  at Yoshi's legendary jazz club last New Year's. It was at this time that I  got to hear several cuts from When I Look Into Your Eyes. This new music is  a natural progression for a singer/pianist like this young woman. In this  album she makes full use of her vocal talent, she teases us with her take  on Popscile Toes and she thrills us with I've Got You Under My Skin. I am  simply left wanting more. Diana, I've got you under my skin.
6300248178|5.0|This movie is so well put together! Better than the second. The jungle really fits well with the movie and all the characters and the music is awesome. I recommend seeing if u havent yet.
B000002J20|5.0|In 1973, I knew YES were recording a new album. Melody Maker and Circus magizines had quoted Jon Anderson as saying that the band were getting back to the roots, the basics, and we waited. I bought the album the day it was  released and hurried home. I was stunned. From the opening chant through  the last audible strains of music, I had never heard anything to compare to  this. This was not rock and roll. This was (and is) that generations finest  hour of recorded music. Perhaps it will take another 25 years for the music  industry to acknowlage this. Yet,in 25 years we may well hear Tales on  public radio
0790701251|5.0|This movie has the best acting and is almost hilarious. One of the best movies in my category. I urge you to see it. Props to stanley kubrick.
B000003CKH|5.0|Cake is the ultimate in picking random music styles, adding their own twists, and making it sound masterful.  This, AND they are incredible in concert!  What more could you ask?  Fashion Nugget and Prolonging the Magic  have become staples of my CD collection.... now I just need to go get  Motorcade of Generosity.
B000003S09|5.0|I quite disagree with several reviews on this page. I understand that the bad remastering is evident, but that adds to the majestic, doomy, earthy sounds on this landmark progger. As for the Mellotron solo in Moonchild,  well, that adds to the anticipation for a splendid conclusion, as good as  the finish on Supertramp's Crime of the Century. The songs are all great:  21st Century Schiziod Man is a shockingly, heavy, mysterious, outgoing  piece, while I talk to the wind is an innocently covered statement on what  the world is coming to. Then there's Epithaph, a beautiful, sad, terrifying  piece, the bleak Moonchild and the grand In the Court of the Crimson King.  So, dear reader, buy this now or embark on the endless journey of favorable  reviews that follow. Good Luck.
B000002AH1|5.0|This album is not melodies and harmony it is shape. It is beyond music in that it's shape lies in the realm of purely abstract sound. Even though it is all of this, the greater mystery is how it just has a groove that is so  incredible to listen to you'll never get tired of listening to it. On the  contrary it is still forward looking and sounds better on multiple  listenings.
B000006IUQ|5.0|My one regret is not seeing this at my local cinema, but then it only ran for a week. I had intended to go and see it but decided to wait until next week... Thankfully I was able to rent it out on laserdisc and was hooked.  <br />Edge of the seat entertainment indeed! Bart the Bear should have been  given an oscar for best supporting actor - certainly he was a lot better  than a lot of other film stars in other films.<br />This is a fine film which  I would highly recommend to anyone who wants to watch a good taut thriller  with some good characters. I get the feeling that some people see the name  &quot;Elle McPherson&quot; and expect either a dumb movie so don't watch it  or they expect lots of gratuitous sex and are disappointed. Its such a  shame that her name is so prominent in the credits as she only appears for  a short time, the film is dominated by the excellent performances of  Hopkins and Baldwin. I certainly agree with one previous reviewer that one  of the most shocking and powerful scenes has to be the character who falls  prey to the bear. <br />On another note, I loved the scenery. This is a great  film, I can't compliment it enough. Watch it, buy it, love it.<br />This is an  excellent transfer, with very good sound. My only complaint would be the  lack of features - even the laserdisc had sleeve liner notes (which gave  information about Bart the bear and how he had to be shown how to be  hostile and special wooden walkways had to be constructed so that he  wouldn't damage his paws!)
B000003TAR|5.0|This is awesome. It's thier worst album (out of all thier studio abums) and it is still one of the best albums ever. Don't make it your first choice if you're gonna buy a Nirvana album as such, but I didn't give it 5  stars for nothing. It is just soooooooooooo raw and soooooooooo good.
0783233477|5.0|The photography is excellent and the soundtrack is absolutely beautiful on this 3 hour DVD. It's a highly emotional romantic drama, but also has it's humorous moments, thanks to Brad Pitt's style of delivery.  <br />I've read  that this is the most expensive non-special effects movie ever made.  The  scenes are set in lavish surroundings at the country estate and the  Manhattan penthouse.  According to the comments on the DVD by cast and  director, over one hundred takes went into some of the scenes and the  fireworks display was shot over a period of a week - so lots of bucks up in  smoke - but the result is amazing!  I wish more movies were made with such  polish and attention to detail.<br />The movie starts out chatty like any  other movie, but then when Joe Black is introduced, the dialog becomes  minimal and body language, eyes, and facial gestures are used to convey  what is not spoken.  It's an interesting style that allows the music to  have more impact rather than compete with dialog.  It gives you time to  absorb more of the scene -- you actually feel the emotion being conveyed.   A passive viewer may not appreciate this approach, but it definitely adds  to the intrigue and mystery of the story.  Some questions that are proposed  to Joe (Death) are not aswered and the viewer must speculate as to an  appropriate response.  <br />Hopkins is sensational as he executes a smooth  performance.  Claire Forlani is beautifully sensuous and intelligent with  such an emotional performance.<br />Then there's Brad Pitt...   A departure  from his past acting roles, (which have been highly regarded) -- usually  some sort of violent or despicable character.   Here, Brad plays a well  spoken, sophisticated well groomed character who could charm anyone with  his manner.  He has a soft-spoken style that is occasionally displaced with  a more assertive voice when he reassures Bill that he is in control of his  situation.  His verbal interaction is even more terse than the other  actors.  Often times intiating or responding to questions with a single  word.  It keeps the mystery going with so much left unsaid. His initial  introduction to Bill (Hopkins) is cold and terrifying.  He looks like  &quot;a kid in a suit&quot; as Hopkins puts it.  But &quot;Joe&quot; makes  it clear that &quot;nothing is negotiable&quot;.  The way Pitt says it is  frightening.  Throughout the rest of the movie, the romance with Susan  builds and the intensity between these two (Pitt and Forlani) is  incredible.  This aspect of Pitt's acting should be exposed more often in  movies!  He projects a sensitive, tender, and loving character... also a  little embarrased and shy.  So much for that bad boy image, Brad!
B000003TA4|5.0|This is Nirvana's best album. I have nothing more to say. I've got all of the albums so my criticisms are fair. Buy this. Period.
B000002NJS|5.0|One album. Five videos. Many awards. Millions of copies sold.<br />&quot;Ray Of Light&quot; is something else entirely, far from the days of &quot;Lucky Star&quot; or even the &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina&quot; remixes.  Dance, dance, dance, DAMMIT. She said it best with the title of her 1987  remix CD. Yes, ma'am, Ms. Ciccone. We will dance, for you! Not only does  she speak of maternity, fame, and spiritual enlightenment on this new  album, but Madonna keeps us dancing. <br />One Question: what will her next  album be???<br />P.S. &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot; will not hit #1.  Madonna's more interested in artistic integrity now, not commercial  success.
B0000035E7|5.0|Bleach is the first in a long line of excellent albums by Nirvana. It is is just so brilliant. It's heavy, fast in places and contains some cool solos. The lyrics are also cool. If you are a grunge fan you MUST buy a  Nirvana album, any one except Unplugged in New York which is sh!t.
0517092948|5.0|After so many years, Shakespeare stills shines above everybody else. No words to describe the feelings and emotions I had reading this book
B000002HRE|4.0|When I first bought this CD I nearly cried. I wrote into Amazon and gave it a mere two stars. Then I started to like it and wrote in again giving it 3 stars. Now I'm writing in again and giving it four stars because I like  it so much. It grows on you. I will agree that it isn't really hard-core  metal, but niether is it alternative. Ignor the two other reviews I gave  it, this album rocks. I can't wait to get Master Of Puppets though, as  speed metal is what I really like and Re-Load isn't speed metal (with the  exception of Fuel).
B000006OBQ|5.0|Sinatra at The Sands. Brian Evans Live at The Desert Inn (both places Frank played). Frank is rocking in this new cd with newly added tunes not previously heard on the original version. I like this album because it  represents the past, and I like Brian Evans because he represents a future  for someone singing these songs with integrity.
B000003TAB|5.0|Thier 3rd album and they never went mainstream as such. They are just soooooooooooooo cool. This album is raw, raw, raw, and it kicks a**
B000002R4R|5.0|One of the best examples of British Jazz-Rock. If you like Miles Davis' BITCHES BREW, you'll love this album!
0375707972|5.0|I am appalled by some of the reviews Amazon's readers have submitted. This book is obviously not for the romance novel set. Those raised on fast-moving pulp fiction that revolves around sex and violence might not  appreciate this simple, yet profound piece of literature that explores the  relationship between those Germans born after WWII and their parents. The  author answers no questions, he raises them and offers them to the reader  to digest. These are important questions: how guilty is each German who  lived through WWII? What are the responsibilities of their children? Can  those children ever live normal lives under the cloud of what their parents  did or didn't do? The protangonist of this story could not. He is forever  scarred. What about his parents, the Germans represented by Hanna, his  father, the truck driver? It's a great deal to think about.  It is  beautifully written, though I think the author made some excuses for his  parents' generation despite his good intentions.
B00000F1D3|5.0|I just wanted to say that the reviewer for Amazon.com obviously is not a musician and has no clue as to what a &quot;wah-wah&quot; effect is. The effect on Cher's voice is very cool and very today. It's more like a  time/pitch shift but insead of being &quot;rounded&quot;, where you can  hear the up, then the down, it's stair-stepped, where you hear the effect  instantly upon going to it. It fits perfect in the song and I think it  enhances the overall song. For those that care, Jimi Hendrix used a lot of  &quot;wah-wah&quot; (a wah wah pedal) on his guitar solos, and those  sounded great.
B00000IL1K|5.0|Once again, Sarah is brilliant. Traditional and new songs plus a few covers in a quite adequate proportion. Dust in the wind, deliver me, eden, nessun dorma, so many things, tu ..., it is hard to say that one is the  best among so perfect songs. And her voice is fantastic ! Great album !!
B000002UAX|5.0|If you know that 'satire' isn't the opposite of 'this tire', then you'll understand and appreciate the spirit behind the White Album. <br />The rest of you, keep taking those irony supplements.
B000002J1I|2.0|One of Yes's patented trademark is  to include at least one dorky or pointless  song on each album. Examples ; A Venture , Five Percent For Nothing , Holy Lamb , White Car , Turn Of The Century , Take The Water To  The Mountain or Open Your Eyes. But never the whole album. ! Best track is  &quot; Onward &quot; . My guess , they were 4 minutes short and pulled this  song out of the archives. I cannot believe the same person (Wakeman)  who  wrote and played beautiful keyboard pieces of music ( such as  Roundabout,  You and I  and  Awake )  would have the nerve to record  a piece of garbage  as Future Times/Rejoice.
6304618344|5.0|In a tivoli the FBI-agent Sean Archer and his son are merely having a caroussel-ride. A shot is heard, and the bullet meant to be hitting Archer, hits his son instead. Now the hunt begins. Possessed only by the mission of  getting the murderer and ice-cold psycho and terrorist Castor Troy. During  the hunt Castor is hurt and falls into a coma. But not without letting  Archer know, that a huge biochemical bomb has been placed in Downtown San  Francisco. A bomb big enough to destroy the entire city. The clock´s  ticking, but nobody knows where. Sean Archer now gets a really advanced  surgery. The doctors are changing his look to the one of the killer. We now  follow Archer on the bonebreaking hunt between Troy´s own men, in order to  locate the bomb threatening San Francisco with a terrible  armageddon.<br />John Woo did again. He managed to direct an exellent  motion-picture with two of the greatest actors ever - John Travolta and  Nicolas Cage. <br />I just love it.
0312199066|4.0|This book was well worth the effort.   I walk away  with two major impressions:  one, wow, what an achievement the Apollo program was and two, double wow, what an ego these astronauts had.  I found their achievements  to be inspiring, but their human persona left a lot to be desired.  But I  appreciate the honesty, the author could have easily glossed over that.
B000002GBD|4.0|The Scots delivered terrific hard rock back in 1975! The production is even more metallic than in their previous effort, the already high-voltage RAZAMANAZ. In HAIR OF THE DOG, when McCafferty and company crank the volume  and begin to scream and riff unashamedly, then you are taken to heavy rock  heaven! <br />The title song is a MONSTER (isn't the riff a power chord  version of &quot;Day Tripper&quot;?), and I guess it can be included in the  Top 10 most devastating of the seventies. The sonic land-slide continues  with &quot;Miss Misery&quot;, about a heartbreaker &quot;gypsy  dancer&quot;. Heavy riffage, incredible &quot;rip-saw vocals shredding  everything in sight&quot;, cool slide solo ... It can be formulaic, but if  one has a warm spot in the heart for rock'n'roll, it is hard to  resist.<br />&quot;Changin' Times&quot; reminds me of &quot;Black Dog&quot;.  You know, the heavy bluesy riff, and the verses in between. Hot stuff! And  &quot;Beggars' Day&quot; is even more powerful, an anthemic rock that comes  close to &quot;Hair of the Dog&quot;. I've never heard Nazareth alive, but  I guess &quot;Beggars...&quot; gets what it takes to be one of the  highlights in the band's sets. &quot;Whiskey Drinkin' Woman&quot; is a  lighter, yet enjoyable southern-rock boogie .<br />&quot;Rose in the  heather&quot; is a gentle instrumental that's not remarkable, and  &quot;Please Don't Judas Me&quot; is a 9-minute-long song. The melody is  very predictable, and maybe some won't have the patience to listen to all  of it, but the band is in fine shape, trying' to sound epic. Actually, I  prefer the no-nonsense heavy rock attack of the rest of the album.<br />Oh,and  there's the hit &quot;Love Hurts&quot;. Some tried to put it down by saying  it is &quot;a proto-power ballad&quot;, and they are right! But  we should  recognize it is a lovely romantic rendition,  combining the energy of the  band with a sweet, fifties-like feel (check the smart use of slide in the  solo). Thesong is OK, and if I were a teenager in the mid 70's (instead of  a baby), I wouldn't mind dancing with my date while  listening to  &quot;Love Hurts&quot;!<br />Summing up: Grear rock album! I think only ACDC  &quot;Highway to hell-Back in Black&quot; came close to Nazareth in  riff-power. But Nazareth came first and they had a more diverse sound. HAIR  OF THE DOG is essential listening to understand the hard rock experience!
0805047905|5.0|My 1-year-old simply adores this book! She begs for me to read it to her over and over. I've caught her &quot;reading&quot; it to herself countless times. The cadence of the words, as well as the colorful pictures seems  magical.
6304432488|5.0|Another great edition to the Die Hard series. It is definatley the best of the three.  It's only downfall is that you have to see the first one to understand it.  But, the first one was excellent as well.  Bruce Willis  definatley deserves most of the credit.  Willis is probably thought of as  the most underrated actor in the buisness.  He knows this and he doesn't  let it bother him one bit.  Samuel L. Jackson also played well in the film.
B000002WYT|5.0|once again dmb has captivated everyone with his voice and his bands talent behind him. this is a great album, it has something for every one. please buy or borrow this album, because you are guranteed to like it.
B000001C6M|5.0|I guess I'm not drooling over this one as much as some other people, but I know when I'm hearing some great, classic metal. Show No Mercy is full of that early satanic slayer sound we all know and love. &quot;Die By the  Sword&quot; &quot;Fight Till Death&quot; &quot;Face the Slayer&quot; are  all outstanding tracks. We hear some incredible drumming from the future  legend Dave Lombardo and some screaming guitar solos. Definitely a must own  album for an old-school early 80s metal fan. The beginning of the legend.
B000002KBH|5.0|This is by far the Dead's best studio album, hands down.  Every single song on this album is magical. The mellow quality and beautiful melody are untouchable.  Ripple is by far my favorite on this album.  A must have for  any true Dead fan!
B0000019PA|5.0|I picked up this album because the cover looked interesting, a kid and a woman with a drum for a head. Hmmmm... Also, I was immediately won over by fellow Elephant Six Band Beulah (also highly recommended). I won't say this  is the best album ever, or that it is musically significant, but i will  acknowledge the power of the music in getting a response. The lyrics are  hauntingly nostalgic, heartbreakingly beautiful in the way that very few  things are. ITAOTS makes me want to cry, laugh and vomit all at the same  time! How's that for emotional! Every time i listen to this album, I want  to cry. Also of note, when I was younger, I was not the King of Carrot  Flowers, but I saw a carnival exhibit with a &quot;Two-Headed Baby&quot; in  a jar. The song &quot;Two-Headed Boy&quot; really really speaks to me  because of that experience. A must for all two-headed human fans...
6302799066|5.0|I was born in 1945, thought the movie was great when I saw it in a theatre, and have enjoyed it ever since. I noticed that my children and even my younger friends do not have the same feeling for the movie as I do.  Perhaps one had to live through the Cuban Missile Crisis to appreciate a  movie that could make you laugh at something that otherwise was profoundly  scary.
0767802519|5.0|This movie is amazing. The actors are really, really doing a wonderful job here. It is full of action, romance and tragedy. It has everything!! Buy!!
0790734060|5.0|Years ago, a bridge acquaintance was raving about a film he had just seen in the theater.  This film was \\"Amadeus\\".  I had reservation going in (often, when someone gushes about a movie, it never lives up to the hype).   As it turned out, this movie was as good as advertised, and even more  so.<br />The story of Mozart is told by a jealous, aging court composer  (Salieri) in flashbacks.  What's fascinating about this film is the  fervered hatred this also-ran composer has for Mozart, which contrasts  sharply to his absolute love of the genius's talent and music.  Although I  doubt it is even close to being historically accurate, it is a great  fictional story and the music is wonderful.  Add to that, a worthy  oscar-winning performance by E. Murray Abraham, fine performances by the  entire cast, and one is left with a film that can be enjoyed over and over.   Between 1 and 10, Amadeus gets a solid 9.
B000003YNH|5.0|Robin is one of the finest pianists of our day.  He is the pianist with the San Francisco Symphony.   He accompanies many musicians in the Bay Area.  His technique is crisp, his muscianship impeccable.   His  performance of the variations are such a delight  that one could listen to  them over and over.  I highly recommend this recording.
6303109950|3.0|Tombstone is an interesting film in that it came out at the same time as the superior (I feel) Wyatt Earp.  I saw Tombstone first, and although I thought it to be a good movie with a great, and often funny, performance  from Val Kilmer, I felt the film was uneven (I didn't like it near as much  the second time around).  Russell is solid as the stone-faced lawman, but  the representation of Ringo and the Clantons seemed typical  Hollywood.<br />Unlike Wyatt Earp (which tries to be an epic--showing the  life of the famous lawman), Tombstone centers only around the time he and  his brothers moved to that Arizona town.  As noted in the other reviews of  both films, it's surprising Hollywood chose to show the shootings of Morgan  and Virgil Earp on the same evening and not months apart as had actually  happened (probably due to movie length constrants).  Between 1 and 10, I  give Tombstone a solid 6.  It's well worth the rental or purchase, if for  no other reason than seeing Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday.
6300214753|5.0|A DVD is not worth a penny with out the qualities and extras of a DVD, get with it , I spend enough money here already.  Do something for your customers. Allow them the courtisy of experiencing what a DVD is all about,  or we'll just go back to VHS.  5.1, angles, cut scenes, etc. Hello does  anyone know why we would buy a dvd???????
6303431038|4.0|When I saw the epic \\"Wyatt Earp\\" in the movie theaters, it was about 190 minutes long, and although I liked it, I couldn't honestly give it more than 3 stars.  This video expanded version (212 minutes), added greatly to  my enjoyment of this film in that it made the movie more seamless.   Although a bit dull in places (especially the first hour), the film picks  up speed and impact.  I found all the performances very good, especially  Dennis Quaid's interpretation of `Doc' Holliday (although I must admit I  liked Val Kilmer's interpretation better in \\"Tombstone\\" -- I think he had  better lines).  Actually, Quaid looked very much like real Holiday.   <br />Richly textured, \\"Wyatt Earp\\" has a lot going for it (accuracy not  withstanding).  I don't know if there will ever be a definitive version on  this man's life, but I think this film probably comes as close as we are  going to get.  While it was a little difficult to sit in the theater for  more than 3 hours, this film should do very well in the video market.   Between 1 and 10, the expanded version of \\"Wyatt Earp\\"gets a marginal 8.
0375707972|4.0|I am amazed at the negative reviews on The Reader. This book is incredible in its depth contained in the wonderful story which wastes no unnecessary words. It asks a number of questions, it asks us to consider another  perception other than our own, to consider all sides of an issue and how  complex life really is. On the surface, it would appear that Hanna was a  cruel SS guard, and yes she was. She was also much more than that and we  know her as a kind friend before we know her as a prison guard. A person  reading about this trial would assume that Hanna was gulity as sin and  deserves to die over her crimes against humanity. And yet we know the story  is much more complicated than that. Who can question the shame that brings  people to act as they do? Don't we all cover up shame and at what price?  The author also raises the excellent question of what we as the next  generation are to make of the Holocost, what are we to do with our  knowledge? This book is beautifully written and highly recommended for  those who want to ponder some issues and not simply be entertained.
6300216039|5.0|This movie is so captivating...The tragedy of Romeo and Juliet is capturing to audiences everywhere and of every age.  The more recent release of this masterpiece can hardly do the justice that Oliver and  Hussey have done.  They wonderfully portrayed the clandestinme lovers, and  captured my heart.
B000002HO3|5.0|I first heard this CD at a friend's house last year, and had to buy it.  I had never heard the group before, but was captivated by their sound and rhythm.  This is truly one of the best pop groups I have ever heard, and  their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; CD is excellent - it gets better every time  I listen to it.
B00000ADG2|2.0|This CD isn't worth the hype it has been given.  It's okay but that's it.  Just okay.  Her messages are clear but too preachy in my opinion.
B00000DHRX|5.0|Good Show George Michael, What a Sterling album. When I opened the cd I thought what the devil, two cd's! I had only expected one. What a spiffing idea how you did seperate those songs eh, good show chaps
0451196716|4.0|This was an excellent read, I had read 95% of it in one day.  I have read some criticisms of the ending, but the ending was intelligent.  It is ambigious, and seemingly purposefully so.  If you want to settle into a  happy ending where the knots are fitfully tied, perhaps Judy Blume would be  more suiting. I took a different spin on the book, somewhat similar to  another critic's note on the simliarity of the Nazi death marches.  I found  this to maintain a striking similarity to the Vietnam crisis. Consider the  parallels:  At the beginning, all of the boys are psyched, blind, not  knowing what they are getting into.  The idea of a 'bang' flag suggests the  notion of seeming invincibility.  Yet when entered into the  &quot;crisis&quot;, most are not able to succeed against the enemy (in the  case, the road, or, each other).  Those in Vietnam who made it home, paid a  terrible price, usually in terms of Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome.   Consider this ending, where the protagonist's victory doesn't seem to be  &quot;all it's cracked up to be&quot;, sure he may receive or is intended  to receive his &quot;prize&quot;, but that is anticlimatic to what he is  undergoing...the psychological and physical exhaustion, as well as death if  one interprets the ending this way. A fast round of applause for this  thought-provoking work.
B00000DHRX|5.0|Okay, you're probably not going to listen to me because I'm a teenager and all teenagers are supposed to overreact. But this is a really a wonderful CD. Dude, this is the best album I've ever experienced (better than  backstreet boys)!! It has 2 Cds with different moods. One is &quot;for the  heart&quot; which contains smooth, serene love songs in it to melt your  senses. He has a wonderful voice that just pierces through your body! The  other CD is &quot;For the Feet&quot; which contains loud, fun music like  &quot;Faith&quot; and &quot;I want your sex&quot;. The double CD contains 2  full 28 page booklets with pictures and lyrics of him in silver print. All  the songs are unique in its own way and &quot;Heal the Pain&quot; is very  exciting! And let's not forget the famous &quot;Careless Whisper&quot;! I  practicallly worship this CD. It is truly the best of George Michael.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is one of the best records I've heard in a long time.  Songs like &quot;porcelain,&quot; &quot;Scar Tissue,&quot; &quot;Easily,&quot; and &quot;Road Trippin,&quot; showcase the Chili Peppers new mature restraint.   These songs are exciting and melodic.  Thank God the Peppers are back!
6303433766|5.0|this was very surprising to me that gore master peter jackson, the man who did Dead Alive, the bloodiest film on earth, made this movie. this is a excellent film. i also recommend peter jackson's other great films, Bad  Taste, Dead Alive, Meet The Feebles, Forgotton Silver. this is a good  movie, surprised the hell out of me.
0380973464|4.0|Having read all the other reviews, I don't have much to add.  I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard while reading a book.  Yes, the book could have been better edited, but I would have missed the things that  probably would have been removed.  I'd compare it to something like the  Beatles' &quot;White Album&quot; -- it could have been cut down to a single  record, but then you would have never heard some of the interesting little  side works like &quot;Wild Honey Pie&quot; or &quot;Why Don't We Do It in  the Road.&quot;<br />I also never thought I would come across a novel that  could incorporate higher level mathematics so well.<br />I'll bet  contemporary readers complained about the &quot;unnecessary&quot; detail on  the whaling industry that Melville included in &quot;Moby Dick&quot;,  too...<br />hee HEE!
B0000020C4|5.0|Lea Salonga has the most beautiful voice I have ever heard! Her performance as Eponine is breath-taking! I'm only 14, but have almost everybroadway CD and she, out of everybody, has the best voice I've ever  heard! I'm astonished every time I hear her sing! BUY IT!
0780626478|5.0|I Love This Movie. It kicks butt. Seen it twice and going to buy it. Love the cast.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauren's album is the shiznick!!  All of the cuts on here are fresh, laid back in rhythm and rhyme, and just so full of wisdom.  Lauryn can really &quot;flow&quot;.  She incorporates this well with her singing voice (just  like Missy Elliott, but better).  A definite buy for anyone who loves to  reminisce.  This album has an old-school flavor that is &quot;on the  money&quot;.
0385493800|3.0|This book is worth reading but I feel that it isn't his best writting he has done.  The plot just doesn't seem to be as catching as &quot;The Chamber&quot;. For any Grisham fans I would suggest this book but Mr.  Grisham please write another book don't let us remember you with this book.
0395759242|5.0|I must admit to my shame that although I had previously considered myself to be fairly historically knowledgable (for a layman), I was stunned by Hochschild's book.  Never had I heard about the scale of the murder and the  grotesque features of Leopold's oppression in the Congo &quot;Free  State.&quot;  I had heard mention of the rubber terror by History profs in  college, but this book flattened me in a way few nonfiction works have.  It  also showed me that foreign manipulation of our government is nothing  new--Leopold's use of lobbyists to influence U.S. Congo policy was a  classical political snow job.  A valuable, and very nonspecialist-friendly,  contribution to my still insufficient but improving understanding of  African History.
6305268843|5.0|This movie is so incredibly romantic.  I have rented it twice in 2 weeks.  The acting by Steven Dillane is superb.  His eyes are very expressive, almost speaking for him.  One reviewer said that you don't find out what  she needed the money for until the end, but in actuality, you find out in  the first couple minutes.  The very beginning tells a lot about the movie,  but it is hard to hear some of what is being said.  I kept rewinding to  make sure I heard everything.  Steven Dillane &amp; Sophie Marceau have an  incredible amount of chemistry.  You will either love or hate the ending  (my sister hated, but I though it was very fitting).  I love the character,  Charles Godwin played by Steven Dillane.  He had great dedication and  seriousness to his position and because of this creates that intense  &quot;forbidden desire&quot; he feels for Elisabeth (Marceau).  I only wich  this adapted from a novel. I definately will be buying the video once the  price drops!!
B00000BKDZ|4.0|This CD is one of Maiden's best!!It compasses their ability to write melodic songs with complexity that other bands cannot acheive without losing their listeners in a mess.Maiden are certainly masters and  &quot;seventh son&quot; is as good an example as any!!
B000002U82|5.0|Buy it
6300183971|1.0|It is quite telling that that the only people I've met who have enjoyed this film saw it while stoned. Let's face it folks, this film is pretentious, dull, lifeless, incoherent, and all the analysis in the world  won't make it any more entertaining. Frankly, I don't care if this film  holds the secrets to life's meaning; it's still unwatchable. Who are these  characters? What does the plot mean? Who could possibly care? Save some  time and take a nap instead.
6302136105|5.0|This movie shows the true life of the doors and what they were all about. I think that everyone should bye this movie again it is great.
6305399212|5.0|This is the best movie ever made.  It includes 17 minutes of never been seen footage and the classic senatary gun seen.  This should have won an oscar award!
B000002R0R|3.0|This album was released (I think) in 1977, and it shows, in the sense that the punk 'revolution' had come along and all the great bands of the art-rock pantheon had suddenly, and rather mysteriously, been labelled  dinosaurs. This is GGs attempt to react to this. I think it works and it is  certainly a very good place to start a GG collection as the songs are less  complex and more straightforward. This album will introduce you to a band  whose abilities were extraordinary by anyone's estimate. 'Betcha thought we  couldn't do it' amuses me as I think it was meant to amuse the listener. It  is GGs attempt at hard rock - they could not bring themselves to be  actually punk - after all how could they - they were real musicians! As  hard rock I think it is a good track. The rest of the album is excellent  too. &quot;Two weeks in Spain&quot; by the way I do not find embarrassing.  It is a track with a very British theme - that is all. The traditional  British annual blue collar visit to the sun and sea in Spain. Fish and  chips all the way and no attempt to understand anything about Spain or the  Spanish.<br />What IS poor is the CD reissue, totally lacking in any bass. The  original vinyl is much superior, no question. If there is an import version  available then you should get it and not this version.
B00000JGOH|2.0|I thought this movie was a cute, cleaver, charming film, but Best Picture??? and what's worse, Best Actress???  Honestly the one truly great aspect of this film in the great and cleaver script!  As a writer, this is  without a doubt a good one.  Though, I urge everyone to go out and see  Elizabeth and compare Gweneth's and Cate Blanchet's performances, and you  decided which one deserves the Oscar!   Gweneth was cute and again  charming, though falls flat of portraying true grace, artistry, emotion,  and character.  In my Opinion, Cate was robbed.  As a film student,  Shakespere in Love is no where near the movie classics stage and will fade  with time.  It's a shame &quot;Oscar&quot; had to be degraded.  Go back and  see Elizabeth, and even Saving Pri. Ryan, which in all honesty deserved  Best Picture, though if I had it my way, Elizabeth would've won it all.
B00000F14B|1.0|I couldn't finish watching this one.  It gave me a headache.  The picture had a slight white shadow around the figures, just enough to make it appear out of focus.  Maybe the VHS verison is OK, but if all DVD disks are the  same quality that I saw, I'd say skip this one.
B00000I8BX|5.0|Awesome Sounds and great rhythm, a great buy if you like Limp Bizkit, Korn, and others like them. Must Buy!
B00000IQBL|5.0|All of Kubrick's films for Warner Brothers (A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket and Eyes Wide Shut) were shot in either full-frame or the 1.66:1 ratio, and projected in the 1.66:1 format.   I am surprised that this edition does not recreate the full theater  experience, but I'm sure Stanley wanted it this way.<br />Now about the movie.   This is a masterpiece.  And I don't mean just the first half.  Anyone who  understands this movie and its message appreciates both acts.  ALong with  his other war masterpiece, Paths of Glory, this is the finest antiwar war  film ever made.  And what a screenplay.  War movies do not get much better  than this
B000001EAQ|4.0|I didn't like this album at first (like many people), and I thought U2 had lost their magic. True, it is not the old U2, however, U2 HAS NOT LOST ITS MAGIC! After listening to this album on headphones a few times and reading  the lyrics I am now hooked.  U2's ingeniousness is somewhat hidden and will  not be discovered unless the listener gives it a chance to reveal itself.   Without a doubt, the gem of this album is &quot;If God Will Send His  Angels&quot; (track 4). (Note: if you just want IGWSHA, DON'T buy the  single because it is edited and is robbed of it's power.)   I also enjoy  the rest of the songs after IGWSHA. (I don't like the first 3 songs)  The  poetic lyrics make up for the parts that are musically lacking, and vice  versa. This album is worth the patience, give it a chance.
0375707972|4.0|This novel is a beautiful, haunting story of love and loss that readers won't forget.  Part 1 is sensual and honest...poignant and tender.  The remaining two parts echo the beginning.  The reader goes on a psychological  journey through the mind of the narrator as he chronicles his adulthood and  the haunting of that life he can't seem to lead.  This novel deals with  coming of age and the Holocaust in a very different way, and readers will  struggle with moral and ethical issues.  I could not put this book  down...and I read it in one sitting!  I highly recommend this book.  It's  one I will never forget.
B000002JKA|5.0|How could you go wrong with insane guitar work from Petrucci, mad drumming from Portnoy, extreme bassist work from Myung, and the astonding sounds of Moore.  LAbrie's singing is excellent.
B0000028RR|5.0|When I got Evil Empire I thought it was the best cd I had ever heard. Then I bought Rage Against the Machine a year later and realized that I hadn't lived before I heard that cd. They have more meaning in their music than  any of the fakes that are only together to make money. Must Have.
B00000DRA9|5.0|This is the best soundtrack next to Labyrinth and Licence to Kill. I love it. It brings back memories of watching The neverending story as a child.
B00000J7JO|5.0|The guitar work will put you into an altered state. Every song: Around the world, Parallel Universe, Scar Tissue, Otherside.... flows.  They have matured since BloodSugarSexMagik. Anthony Kedis is at his best with lyrical  song and fast rap.
B00000J7JO|4.0|Californication is a fresh and funky record from one of the most consistent bands around.  This is by far their best CD since Mothers Milk.  Go buy this!
B0000025HU|5.0|When I ordered this from Amazon and played it for the first time -- yeah yeah okay. But now, it gets  better and better and better everytime I play it in my office while I'm programming. Man, I am playing it again and again  and it brings me still to higher ground, the orgasm of which I know not  when. Thanks for your reviews, I discovered a truly great gem...
B00000J6AG|5.0|Track #2 &amp; #17 are definitely my favourites bringing manly sounds/lyrics representing the hunting for love/sensual feelings. A great piece of eclectic sounds.  Buy the maxi CDs too. They contain 2 great  tracks ideal for a rainy sunday afternoon in bed...
B00000J2KX|5.0|I REALLY LIKE THIS MOVIE A LOT. ESPECIALLY WHEN JACK NICHOLSON GOES CRAZY FULL GEAR. IT WAS AWESOME AND VERY SCARY. PLUS, DANNY LlOYD WAS VERY GOOD AS DANNY. I REALLY WANT TO SEE THE TRAILER FOR THIS MOVIE A LOT.
6300248569|5.0|This is the best video version of Pride and Prejudice available.  It is the most faithful to the book.  I own all three versions, and recommend this one over the other two
6305165912|5.0|I watched this movie almost weekly (sometimes more) all throughout my past year of college!  I've memorized nearly every scene and can recite some of the most classic lines from the film on demand.  This movie has great  character development (pay special attention to Brant--he's brilliant!!)  and the DVD has an interesting interview with the Coen brothers (I never  realized what strange dorks they are).  It gets better each time you see  it--there are always new quirks and nuances to pick up on.  Buy your copy  now!!!!

0140177396|5.0|This is Steinbeck's classic novelette about two itinerate farm workers in central California, George Milton and Lennie Small. George serves as the \\"guide\\" or father-figure for the simpleminded, large, and strong Lennie.  Both have dreams of having their own place and farm; but, tragedy stops  them. As they reach for their dream, they are denied (\\"The best laid  schemes o' mice and men Gang aft a gley,\\" Robert Burns, 1785). George finds  that he is so attached to Lennie that he can't let the mob get to him. He  discovers that it is his terrible task to free Lennie by the only means  available to him. Steinbeck gained national prominance with this work with  its beautiful use of language and its realistic portrayal of itinerate farm  workers in the 1930s. He was awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature. It  is one of the major works of literature of the twentieth century.
B000002TIK|5.0|THIS WILL ALWAYS  BE THE BEST CD EVER  THE LIVE VERSION OF COURSE TO BAD THE RADIO STATIONS DONT PLAY THESE SONGS ANYMORE ALL THEY PLAY IS WERE AN AMERICAN BAND I TRIED TO MEET THEM IN A.C. BUT BEFORE YOU KNOW IT SOLD OUT  IM ALSO LOOKING FOR THEIR MUSIC VIDEO I GOT A COPY BUT ITS DULL MAYBE A DVD  WILL COME OUT ?
B00000721B|5.0|To this lifelong McCartney listener's ears, the UK version of &quot;All the Best&quot; appears to be a finer more refined version.  For the U.S. owner of &quot;All the Best&quot; there are 5 differences.  1) The studio  version of &quot;Coming Up&quot; instead of the live version which is a  huge mistake:those of us who were lucky enough to attend his 89 and 93  concerts can assert that &quot;Coming&quot; like wine got better as it aged  and Paul experimented with it. &quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot; was a must in  any McCartney best compilation and this one has it.  I'll take  &quot;Mull&quot; over &quot;Junior's Farm&quot; any day.   Also the import  has what any good compilation must have and that is an original track in  &quot;Once Upon A Long Ago.&quot;  One of Paul's most underrated tracks  ever, it is an excellent bridge between his recordings of the 80's and his  expolits later that roared with authority in with strong studio albums and  historic concerts around the globe in the late 80's and into the mid 90's.   &quot;Pipes of Peace&quot; was an OK track especially if you already own  London Town with the longer (better) version of With A Little  Luck.<br />&quot;We All Stand Together&quot; is a novelty to we in the States  but makes perfect sense on the UK version since it went to #4 on the UK  chart in 1984.<br />All in All, the UK version of All the Best is a more  diverse compiliation and a better reprsentation of the skills of Paul  McCartney as a recording artist.  As a pragmactic collector of McCartney  recordings, get the UK version because you get Mull Of Kintyre and Once  Upon A Long Ago. It might cost you a bit more, but to get the same songs  would cost you more in the long run.
B000002IVF|3.0|I must admit that this CD has some stand out tracks and those few I listen to often.  But overall this is a disappointing effort from one of the legends.  I definitely expected much more!
B00000IKSC|5.0|This video is great and so are the Backstreet Boys!I've been to a backstreet boys concert and the vidoe helps me to remember the concert I went to. The Backstreet Boys are by far the best boy band out  there!BACKSTREET BOYS RULE!
B000002KBA|5.0|To this day there has never been another album that has come close to setting the standard for Hard Rock music...Whats cool about this record is at that time there were no other bands to copy..At  least none of the style  of music that was laid down on this one...It was, and is, totally  original...As a practicing musician of 30 years I can say that this is one  to buy...&quot;Speed King&quot; and &quot;Child in Time&quot; alone are  worth the price of this CD...Lyrically this was kind of nasty for the time,  which made it that much better...The guitar riff on &quot;Hard Lovin  Man&quot; had naver been played (or recorded,to my knowledge) to that  time,so I beleive &quot;Ritchie&quot; to be the &quot;Master&quot; of what  we hear today...&quot;Livin Wreck&quot; is kind of goofy,but look at bands  like &quot;The Offspring&quot; or &quot;Ugly Kid Joe&quot;...Thats pretty  goofy...(I like these bands,by the way)...ROCK ON !!!
6300151379|5.0|Well, I've nothing to say about the movie anymore, because all others at here said it for me. So, please, please, please, re-release it!!! In VHS, DVD, Widescreen, With the &quot;Mking of Labyrinth&quot;.  &quot;Labyrinth&quot; is excellent for anyone, any age.
B00000DBXL|5.0|I'm dismayed by the number of reviewers who seem baffled by the lyric's in this CD (and the other Cake CD's too.)  Many songs take lines directly from the Bible, believe it or not!  On this album, &quot;Sheep go to heaven,  goats go to hell&quot; is something Jesus said to his disciples.   Throughout Cake's music, there is evidence that at least one of their  writers is familiar with other scriptures.  (&quot;You part the  waters&quot;.... and *I'm not fit to touch the hem of your garment* also  come to mind.)<br />As for the lyrics being dumb, anyone who has studied  Surrealism (Salvador Dali and Rene Magritte) know that two seemingly  unrelated ideas juxtaposed often result in a deeper truth... and humour.    That's why I listen all the time to Cake's three albums.  They have holding  power because they are deep as well as funky. They're my favorite  group.<br />Incidentally, I'm a high school teacher in her 50's. My son who  lives in CA. gave me my first Cake CD.
0380973464|1.0|As an avid Neal Stephenson reader (he ranks up there with Hemingway in my book) I was sorely disappointed.  His attempt to make this a grand epic overshadowed his ability to tell a good story.  <br />It is WAY too long and  it meanders from time period to time period without going anywhere in  particular.  It's often bizarrely tangential anecdotes became extremely  tiresome to the point at which I found myself yelling, &quot;get to the  point already!&quot; on more than one occasion. We DIDN'T need to spend 5  pages (I'm not kidding!) reading about eating a bowl of Cap'n Crunch or  about the time one of the characters got his wisdom teeth pulled while we  are trying to read a book about cryptology.  Things like that just kept  getting in the way of the story.  Even then it was still a pretty weak  story with very little payoff for the amount of effort that it took to read  it.<br />I sometimes delighted in his prose and it was a grand effort.  In the  end, however, it was just way too poorly put together.  This one could have  handled two or three more edits!  A disappointing effort for such a great  writer.
B00000J7JO|5.0|Just a gorgeous record for anyone who loves music. Listen to all the songs, and really listen. The Chilipeppers have made a record that credits the pace of their evolution.  They have finally arrived. Making a record  that is going to be a classic for years to come.
B00000DHRZ|3.0|The music's OK. I guess I was just expecting the CD to be more like the songs &quot;Pretty Fly (For A White Guy)&quot; and &quot;Why Don't You Get A Job&quot;. The only songs that I would play over are &quot;Pay The  Man&quot;, &quot;P.F.(F.A.W.G.)&quot;, and &quot;W.D.Y.G.A.J.&quot;  Personally, I think The Offspring's older songs are better.
6305232660|5.0|Good realistic portrayal of facing world destruction and attempting to defeat it with todays technology.
B0000025D0|5.0|While others Springsteen albums may be better known by the casual fan, i.e. Born in the USA, Born to Run, this is his piece de resistance.  From the outstanding cover track, to the incredible Prove It All Night, to the  rocking Promised Land and finally to the vastly underrated Racing in the  Street, along with the other tracks of which there are no weak sisters,  rather far from it, this is the best record ever made.
6304083769|5.0|Motoko says:  My all time favorite movie. The creation of a new life form is the plot of this masterpiece. It has stunning graphics and a plot line that is so complex it is a litmus test for your own intelligence. The one  liners are a gllimpse of brilliance (&quot;All things change in a dynamic  enviroment&quot;) and the dialog lacks the cheesiness usually associated  with Anime, especially those dubbed in English. This movie was a religious  expeience for me. A, P.
6300183211|4.0|How I remember watching this film in a Chicago movie theater in 1984. The audience actually cheered when Tony Montana turned the tables on the chainsaw-wielding Colombians to such grisly effect early in the action. For  those days it was an exceptionally brutal movie, but the reason why it  still looks good after 15 years is not because of the violence but because  it is a genuine morality tale about immigration, the American dream,  nothing succeeding and failing like excess, and too many guns chasing too  much coke. Whoever described it as an allegory of impotence also had a  point (so to speak). It doesn't quite deserve a five-star rating because 1)  it's too long and 2) the attempt to portray Montana as motivated partly by  a deranged possessiveness toward his sister is never very convincing. But  Al Pacino carries the day - a wonderful performance.
0140386335|5.0|I thought this book was well written. I couldn't put this book down for it made you realize so many things. the author made himself into a character, I thought. I read this book because it flowed with a steady pace, but never  dull enough for me to put down. this is one author I would like to meet. I  highly recommend this book.
006016848X|2.0|This book had some great advice, but mainly it made excuses for men
0385493800|4.0|I really enjoyed the change of pace.  This was not what I was expecting from a John Grisham book and I found the story touching.  This book is a very satisfying read.  If ever made into a movie - it has the potential to  be one of the better films of the year.
B0000026WD|4.0|Michael knows exactly what the sound of his own
6300216039|5.0|I agree with all of the raving fans--special mention to Mercutio and his &quot;Queen Mab&quot; speech plus his death scene as well as the party scene and the teasing-the-nurse scene. The ONLY flaw? The roaring hot fires  during the party scene--R&amp;J is set during a heat wave--hence so many  short tempers--why do you think Mercutio falls into the horse trough? A  perfect double bill? &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; followed by Franco Z's  R&amp;J.
0553573403|5.0|The first time I read A Clash of Kings - right after its US release - I inhaled it like a starving woman at a feast. After two long years of waiting I just wanted to see what happened next! As with A Game of Thrones,  I was sucked into this world and had a hard time pulling myself out. I  couldn't read anything else for two weeks afterward. Everything else paled  in comparison and I was exhausted! Since then I have gone back and reread  bits and pieces when I felt the need, fully intent on reading the entire  book again...and so I just did. This time I slowly read each chapter -  taking my own sweet time to savor it all. As with A Game of Thrones, I fell  in love with the story, the descriptions and the characters - and what  characters they are! But it's not just the main players (jon, arya, tyrion,  etc.) who seem real enough to walk off the page. Martin's secondary and  minor characters are just as fascinating. Bronn, the Hound, Yoren, Jaqen,  Doloreous Edd, and Vargo Hoat to name a few. I do believe I will never be  able to see a leech and not think of Roose Bolton. And Theon. Theon, Theon,  Theon. Even though I wanted to wring his infuriating little neck, I found  myself feeling something akin to pity for him as the walls of Winterfall  closed in on him. How does Martin do it?<br />Yes, it's violent. It's grim.  Terrible things happen to women AND men - this is war. It's not pretty and  it's not for little kids, but it has everything I could possibly want in a  book : descriptions that jump off the page and a gripping story full of  impelling characters who come alive and proceed to captivate, horrify and  amuse page after page after page.<br />It's simply awesome.
6304233639|5.0|To people who rate this movie a 1 star...  C'mon, these movie ain't real... so, don't try so hard to find good dialogue or realism... just enjoy it and let yourself sucked into the movie...Great effects, fun  actions, non-stop excitement... what else could you ask for from an  &quot;alien invasion&quot; movie? This is the type of INVASION movie I've  dreamt for since I heard about ALIENS... BEST BEST BEST!
630463949X|5.0|This was my first DVD purchase and I thought Mac was outstanding.  I had never seen them before although I enjoyed their music over the years.  Was turned off when one of their hits became Clinton/Gore theme but I have  overcome this because of their talent.
0790729989|4.0|Pitt and Freeman were excellent.  The movie was certainly gritty, although the scenes weren't as violent or gory as I assumed they might be, so I enjoyed the story.  The solving of the puzzle was interesting. I wish the  movie explored the relationship between David (Pitt) and his wife more.  I  hoped to see more of Gwyneth during the movie.
B000002MG1|5.0|This is a great all around album - riding all different levels of emotion and music. Many beautiful, haunting pieces. I originally bought this one for &quot;Ignoreland&quot; and it is my favorite song here. Forget the  lyrics (as a lot of the other reviewers refer to)- this song just rocks and  rides with strong emotion. Other favorites are &quot;Drive&quot; and  &quot;Sweetness Follows&quot;. After buying this as my first from REM, I  was disappointed in follow up purchases from them. The cohesiveness and  feel of this album stands out from the rest.
0783216084|5.0|This is probobly one of my favorite movies of all time.  Titanic doesn't hold a candle next to this wonderful movie!  My friends and I are still scared of the ocean, and will be for ever more!  At my old school, I was  known as &quot;Jaws girl&quot;, and everyone got a big shark in their  yearbook.  I love movies, but this is one of the best, maybe better than  Casablanca or Vertigo.  Jaws is almost a legend, and if you evr go into my  room, you will come out knwing exactly everything you ever wanted to know  or see written, drawn, reviewed,etc. about the best movie in the world:        Jaws
6300214710|5.0|This movie was the best! It really showed what it was like in the 80's. Molly Ringwald was wonderful a great date movie! I can't believe i finally found it at amazon.com!
0767819543|5.0|Central Station depicts a friendship between an old woman and a child. Dora, a retired high school teacher, makes money by writing letters for people passing through Rio de Janeiro's main station. She is a woman that  disbelieves love. Every evening after she comes home by the train, she  habitually reads aloud the letters of her clients and with her neighbor  Irene she discusses the contents of the letters and chooses arbitrarily  some to send and discard those she herself feels boring or unreal.  Scrutinizing others' lives has become her routine for fun.  <br />One day, a  nine-year-old boy Josue and her mother comes to Dora and dictate a letter  to the boy's father. But the mother shortly dies of a traffic accident and  Josue is therefore left alone with no relatives in such a big city, and  wanders around the station. Dora originally intends to make a quick profit  off the child by sending him to an illegal 'orphanage' that virtually sells  the children's body organs. However, perhaps because of her instinctive  maternal compassion, she then decides to rescues him and commits to take  Josue home, and find his father that he's never seen. Thus, a journey of  quest begins. Both of them are retrieving their identities: for Josue, he  is looking for his father, and for Dora, she is finding her heart.  <br />Directed by Walter Salles, Central Station is a well-made film  thoroughly. The handpicked cast, the beautiful cinematography, the touching  movie score, and the sharp direction, all contributes to the success of  such a film that catches a great audience's hearts. The actress Fernanda  Montenegro, who has been acclaimed as Brazil's greatest actress, renders a  convincing performance in the movie, perfectly personifying the harsh and  cynic character Dora. This highly claimed film also wins 1998's Berlin Film  Festival's Golden Bear Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign  Picture in addition to the nomination of this year's Academy Awards.  Moreover, the actress Montenegro is also the recipient of the Best Actress  Award at 1998's Berlin Film Festival and she is also nominated at this  year's Oscar for Best Actress.<br />With the worldwide recognition, Central  Station has been considered one of the best films in the world. It proves  that love and friendship really exist if you are willing to reveal yourself  sincerely to everyone around you. So if you prefer a tearjerker, don't miss  this movie that would definitely warm your heart. And don't forget to bring  your handkerchief, too.
0425129586|5.0|This book was so suspenseful. I stayed up all night reading it because i couldn't put it down! The confession by the killer gives a look into the mind of a murderer. It was the first book I read by Agatha Christie and now  I'm hooked! I still haven't found a better one by her than this.
068484267X|5.0|How could a man from Ireland, born during the Depression have so much to say to a woman born on the South Side of Chicago during the 1950's?  Frnak McCourt was able to tell me more about the Irish character and therefore  myself than any family member.  The book is excellent and the tapes are  even better.
6304458223|5.0|This is a wonderful movie, one I've seen several times on VHS. In fact, I was all set to buy it on DVD when I learned the aspect ratio was 1.33 to 1. In short, no widescreen. As a result, I won't spend the money. This is too  expensive if the format has no appreciable visual difference from the VHS  version. If a movie is filmed in widescreen, and the director is in any way  good, then said director is setting up the shot so as to use the the full  frame. Otherwise, why bother to film it in an aspect that isn't the TV  standard of 1.33 to 1 in the first place? I've noticed this problem showing  up with several DVDs recently, including the soon to be released collection  of Kubrick's work. (Which I hear HE authorized and supervised, which REALLY  mystifies me.) Anyway, it would seem logical to assume that if someone made  the leap to DVD, more often than not they want the widescreen formatting,  especially with the clarity of picture DVD offers. Talk about not utilizing  a technology to its logical limits... But all the same, I recommend this  movie if you haven't seen it. Great stuff.
B00000IL1K|1.0|I have read the reviews.  Doesn't it strike anyone that this new cd is dark and hard to listen to?  ugh.  Our house will continue with the beautiful &quot;Time to Say Goodbye&quot; cd and trash the depressing one.
B00000DRA9|5.0|This is a glorious album.  One can gain great listening pleasure with the purchase of this album.
B00000IO4I|5.0|I am a student at Illinois State University, and they happened to be playing Little Voice at the Normal Theatre, as part of a movie festival, my friends and I went, and it was truly an enjoyable evening.  One of the most  beautiful stories of love and tragedy, filled with characters seething with  reality makes this movie a must see.  All of that said says nothing for the  fantastic portrayal of LV she was so wonderful!! This movie is a must see,  and when you see it recommend it to all who you know!  What a fantastic  film!
0606040439|5.0|I never thought that picking up a science fiction book (this was my first) would open my life to a classical education!  I read the Trilogy.  Then I went on to read the real Demosthenese, then the Campaigns of Alexandar by  Arrian, then Heroditus...  Card has given his characters lives that fit in  with our own ancient mythology.  A fine sequal to the ancients!
B000003BEV|4.0|While I do not agree with some fans here who think this album is as good as any of the Beatles' psychedelic ventures, I admit to liking this very much. I think the Beatles comparison comes because here we find the Stones  experimenting with sounds a lot, as did a lot of groups at the time. It was  a fun trend. Sometimes these recordings get pretty sloppy, unlike Beatles  songs which were usually pretty grounded. However, if you are a fan of  psychedelic music, you shouldn't miss this one. There are good songs too:  &quot;She's a Rainbow,&quot; &quot;2000 Man&quot;... It's refreshing to  hear that the Stones could attempt this kind of thing, before they settled  into straight grinding rock stuff for the rest of their long career.
B00000J2KX|5.0|When I first saw this film in 1980 at the theatre, I saw it opening night, when I saw it again very soon thereafter, something had changed.  There was a 2 minute scene between the scene where Jack Torrance freezes at the end,  and the shot of the picture of the guests from the hotel in the early  1900's.  This scene was of Mr. Ullman visiting Wendy and Danny in the  hospital, telling them how sorry he was about what happened.  I believe  this was the only scene cut from the original film distributed by Kubrick  (re-cut within the first week of release).  Just thought you all might be  interested; hopefully its on the new DVD. :-)
B000002UDB|5.0|Basically this is some of the most mind-bending and wonderful pop ever made, and it stands many repeated listenings. The productions and sounds are superb, combining the most radical experimentation with the most  down-to-earth accessibility. The songs themselves are brilliantly composed,  often deceptively simple. Essential stuff.
0684867621|4.0|After reading Bag of Bones, I thought I'd never buy another S.King book.  I am half way through The Girl Who Lvd T.Gordon and it has me anxiously waiting to read what will happen next.  The book really holds your  interest.  I find myself saying out loud saying hang in there Trisha just  hang in there everything is going to be OK.  For those skeptics that  thought King was losing his touch well he's not! I don't think I'll every  go hiking again.
0782008119|5.0|This was a really hillarious look at how some ticked off Seattle bands got famous then their fans got mad and then everything got blown way out of proportion -- watch it now!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I don't mean to scare anyone off, but I'm in my mid-forties and love this cd.  It is perhaps the only album of the 1990s that inspires the same kind of sonic worship that &quot;Dark Side of the Moon,&quot; &quot;Joshua  Tree,&quot; and &quot;Abbey Road&quot; promulgated.  I don't understand the  reader's comment below about Thom Yorke's passionless singing--it is an  altogether passionate, desperate album that melds Pink Floyd's production  wizardry to the Beatle's inventiveness and early U2's seriousness.   &quot;Let Down&quot; is the &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; of the '90s, and  &quot;No Surprises&quot; is the rock equivalent to &quot;The Love Song of  J. Alfred Prufrock.&quot;  A brilliant achievement.
B000002UAX|5.0|Fan from Canyon: Who the hell was &quot;Don Van Vliet&quot;? and what in blazes has he to do with anything? Fan from Florida: The Beatles weren't just part of the British Invasion, they were the catalysts for it, and  therefore were of direct importance for the indtroduction of many of the  other bands you mention. AS for this album, the White Album, I can only say  that it is magnificent. Why? Because it goes so many different places  (sometimes even within one track) and does it so well. Joy, both simple and  complicated, is the result.
014028009X|5.0|I just finished it and am already missing her.  Loved this book so much I actually couldn't wait to get home to read it every day.  I made myself stop reading it so as to save some for the next day.  I am glad I'm not the  only female having weird thoughts like her (well sometimes!).
014028009X|2.0|I heard about this book on public radio and read about it, from that I expected it to be something I'd like. But as a American who fits Bridget's demographic profile perfectly (except for the nationality!), I was  dismayed. It just wasn't funny to me. Bridget Jones reads like an The Patty  Duke Show--twin cousins, one English, one named Ally McBeal, working as a  lawyer in Boston. It is disheartening to find women my age so weak,  obsessed with men and looks, and only able live life relative to what  others think of how they look, act, etc. Bridget Jones annoyed the hell out  of me. Viva la Feminism!
6302814790|5.0|This movie was beautifully made to accomplish the vent of frustrated dogmatism of behavioural patterns and subjective  approach.  A must see for the whacked types.
B00000J7JO|3.0|I got all into the hype of this album, but once i got it I was kind of disappointed.  TIt's not a bad album, but it could've been much better!
B00000IOSU|5.0|Sarah is an absolute Godsend. Her music is by far the most touching of all that I have ever listened to. A close friend got me started on Sarah's cds at a time when my life was in pieces and I owe the returning of myself all  to Sarah. She is truly amazing. Her words backed by that wonderful voice of  hers are truly amazing. She has a way of reaching in and grabbing a part of  your soul, touching it and you forever. If any of you are just getting  started with Sarah, please do yourself a favor and buy her older cds as  well. They will also bring a spark into your life.  My best goes out to her  and I wish her much continued success.
6305079811|5.0|This is one of those kind of movies you can watch every Sunday sitting in front of the TV with a bowl of raw cookie dough. Quite possibly the best goofy space movie ever made. It defined the 80s for me.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|This is the best punk cd ever! If you want a good cd this is the one! Just buy it!
0380789019|5.0|Gaiman has proven that you can write fantasy without including the duo of Dwarf and Dragon or placing the story in a &quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot; setting. I loved Gaimans London, (both above and below) and his  characters, while undertaking the Epic quest (of sorts), are jacked-up  enough to be wildly amusing. I read this book six months ago and I still  find myself eyeing walls for concealed openings and wondering where closed  doors on old buildings *really* lead to.
B00000J6AG|1.0|Another overrated record.  Moby found some old blues recordings and slapped them on top of disco, probably because they are in the public domain and he doesn't have to pay any royalties.  Sure he's ripping off the  man, just like all the white boys of the past, and all the kids will buy it  not knowing where to find the real thing.  He is obviously desperate for a  new direction, since this CD seems completely directionless.  If you like  these bogus beats, go get yourself some R.L. Burnside and treat yourself to  the real thing.
B000002G6J|5.0|I found this album by accident and after listening to the audio selections, decided to buy it. WhenI played it, I was delighted with the whole CD. It is very relaxing and also, great background music. Ihad  several people in the house when it was playing and they all liked it, and  I am going to purchaseand send several copies to family. Thanksto the audio  selections, which havemade the difference on several albums I have  purchased.
6300151379|5.0|This is an excellent movie, fun with a moral and great music to boot!  Please re-release!!!!
0553108034|4.0|This series is one of the best I've read. The beginning is a little slow, but once you've gotten into it, it's hard to put down. I would highly reccomend this to anyone looking for a good scifi fantasy novel.
0684800713|5.0|Enjoy the revelry of following along a group of Post-World-War-I Americans galavanting through Europe. Fishing, drinking, bullfighting, and fiestas all await you. Experience the fellowship and loneliness that is the Lost  Generation.
B0000025SB|5.0|Pink Floyd takes the life of a forgotten soldier and puts the worst parts of his return from war to music. This disc is an excellent &quot;headphones&quot; disc. if you don't listen to it with headphones you  will miss half of what was recorded. &quot;paranoid eyes&quot; is a  wonderful example of the focus to detail that pink floyd has lost in later  albums. This is an album frequently played in my collection.
B0000041ZT|5.0|If you only know Shostakovich for big doom-laden symphonies or politically incorrect operas, then think again - allow your ears to be tickled pink by the delicate, fun-filled orchestration and sparkling melodies of these  items of musical confectionary!! &quot;Jazz&quot; is probably not the best  description of this style - the equivalent of 1930's vaudeville and cafe  music for the Soviet populace.  Chailly and the Royal Concertgebouw have  obviously had the time of their lives (and a great laugh!) while making  this disc - may I recommend track 10 (Dance No 1)  if you need cheering up?  A brilliant CD and a showcase for the amazing talents of one of the  century's greatest composers/entertainers!!
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is the most interesting Jane Austen book I have read.  I must confess that Emma bored me, and although I liked Sense and Sensability, it is nothing in comparison to Pride and Prejudice.  Jane  Austen does a wonderful job of developing her characters.  By the end of  the book, one becomes acquainted with them.  I am always sorry when I come  to the last page of the book, and there is no more to read.
6304140428|5.0|I disagree with Leonard Maltin's observation that this movie has lost impact.  I show it to my sociology classes, and normally boisterous students are literally stunned into silence (after which I need to  carefully process the film's meaning with them). The performances by Taylor  and Burton are among the best you'll ever witness. (Burton deserved the  Oscar as much as Taylor, their characters so heavily depended on each  other).  The story is complex and intriguing, right down to the poignant  ending which challenges our ideas of what is real and what is not in  relationships. An absolute must if you are collecting great American films.
0590353403|5.0|Harry Potter is one of the best books that I have ever read because of how adventurous and imaginative it is.  He lives with his aunt, uncle, and cousin, who lock him in the closet and tease him.  Everything changes when  he and his guardians find out that he's a wizard!  His aunt and uncle try  to get him away from the wizards, by taking him to a different house. ( It  doesn't work!)  When he gets to school the fun and adventures begin!  I  feel like I'm right there on the adventures with him, and so will you !!
6305079811|4.0|Oh how I tire of George Lucas and his growing  sense of seriousness with the Star Wars films! Now this &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; fellow gives me some hope. This is a fun and flashy film, like a comic strip come to life on the  screen.  The dialog is appropriately cheezy, the visuals are splashy, and  the music by Queen keeps things speeding along. Max Von Sydow as Ming the  Merciless makes you wonder how he ever managed to pull off playing  Jesus  (&quot;Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;). As Star Wars becomes more and more  humorless, I go back to Flash... Saviour of the  Universe.  Indeed!
0590353403|5.0|Harry Potter and The Sorcerers Stone.    Well it is the best book in the WORLD.     Well that is just my point of view.  I wish that my 5th grade class finished the 2nd book.   Of course we aren't half way through it yet.      The 2nd book is just as good as the 1st book so far.   I think it will  be just as good as the 1st book.    Or probably BETTER.
B000007T1M|5.0|First time i saw this band they opened up for Incubus (one the best bands ever).  They had so much energy and put on a badass show so i got the cd and realized how much this band rocks.  Get this cd and make sure you check  em out live.
0590353403|5.0|If you like cliff hangers this is the book for you.  It has cool and new adventures they jump to all kinds of conclusions!  They also have tons of enemies , friends and people that are plan out annoying think that was just  the sorcerers stone (read sorcerers stone first) ! so you better brace  yourself for an all new and awesome adventures from the other book \\"HARRY  POTTER:the chamber of secrets.
B000001DYD|5.0|this is by far my favorite album. each time i listen to it there is something new waiting for me.
B00000IQMT|1.0|The soundtrack of the Phantom Menace as played in the movie was great.  The basic well-loved themes were there, but had matured just as all the original Star Wars fans had matured.  The addition of the chorus,  especially in the Jedi battle scene, only added to the tension and  excitement of that scene.  I practically ran out of the theater and bought  the soundtrack!  But I was so disappointed when I played it at home.  First  of all, why did John Williams mix up the order of the tracks on the CD?   Where is the continuity in that?  Everyone who buys the soundtrack is going  to see the movie at least twice, and part of listening to it is replaying  the specific scenes in your head.  Second, whether he cut the length of the  Jedi battle scene or what I don't know, but it is not as half as long or  dramatic as the music in the part of the movie is.  What with the shortened  versions and the mixed order, it doesn't bring the movie to life at home at  all! In short, don't buy it- it does not live up to the music as heard in  the movie!!
B00000IGGA|5.0|With all the attention on boy-bands and canned pop, Tom Waits comes out in a tour de force that can only be compared to his Raindogs album. The man is genuine, and, on this album, we find that he has found some sort of peace  (sans smokes and booze).  While Big in Japan left me kinda dry (though it  reflects on the early years of his career when critics loved him and  audiences booed him), songs like Take it With Me, Hold On, and the gospel  tinged Come On Up To the House did exactly what only real artists can  do--lift you up and set you back down in a different,better place.  I hope  Tom lives forever, and I'd buy his albums if he had to mouth the words (for  lack of voice) on a videotape.  Tom delivers what matters and the  commercial beauty=bucks doesn't know how to deal with him.  If you're  looking for a contemporary artist that can measure up to the greats in all  genres, (Monk, Parker, Lead-Belly, Hank Williams Sr., Robert Johnson, etc)  buy Waits...you won't regret it.  This album, his latest, still holds on to  the magic that Waits found somewhere...a taxicab, a bar, etc.  Mule  Variations is yet nother jewel in Tom's Porkpie Hat.
B000002L9J|5.0|'The Queen is dead' summs up what the Smiths are about.  From deadly voilent to suicidal kind, the album gives you a ride that sometimes makes your body thrill and your brain shaking. This albums shows that the Smiths  are more than Morrissey and Marr alone.  Keep Rourke and Joyce in mind.
B00000J7RZ|3.0|Jennifer is an amazing actor.Her voice is not all that bad to me if someone's voice sounded as bad as most people are making it out to be they wouldn't have made her album in the firt place.My favorite song is &quot;NO  ME AMES&quot; it is beautiful and Jenn's voice in it is too.The album is  pretty good for her first one.Come on everyone this is her first album cut  her some slack.Everyone has different taste that's why the saying  &quot;that's why they make fords and chevy's&quot; is true here.She is a  beatufil person.She is pretty good just needs a little work.Kepp working  Jennifer..you'll make it.
B0000004V2|5.0|After 'Sgt.Pepper', 'Never mind the bo**ocks' and 'The Queen is dead', this is the best album that reminds me of a new era.  Funky basslines, psyched-out guitars, JB-rhythms, what more do you want ?  From start till  end, absolutely massive !
0783225849|1.0|I have never watched a horror movie so dull as the original black and white Psycho.  Nothing in the film is scary and the soundtrack is repetitive and not extremely memorable.   The acting is very mediocre and I  would suggest the remake anyday. I'll never understand what the big fuss  is,  the movie stinks.  I'd choose  Halloween anyday and It bothers me that  people have the audacity to say Halloween is a remake or some kind of copy  of Psycho.  Halloween may have the character name Sam Loomis--but they are  com-pletely different characters.  It also has the daughter of Janet Leigh,   but Jamie Lee Curtis is much more convincing and just because you the  daughter of an actress,   it doesn't mean you do the same movies.  Hello  people,  Psycho is merely a boring suspense film(they never show anything  in full graphic footage) and I'd recommend Dressed To Kill(a Psycho rip-off  made way better),  Carrie,  Halloween,  The Guardian,   and even A  Nightmare On Elm Street anyday before this lame excuse for a horror film.
0375707972|4.0|This is a novella that presents several issues that might be too difficult to understand for someone who is not connected to that time or the German people of Schlink's age that have struggled with the guilt of their fathers  for all of their life.  Schlink tries to differentiate between love, guilt  and his duty to accuse or defend Hanna, who represents the German people  that committed these crimes during the holocaust. As a German I have  struggled with the same guilt, have gone to the camps to find an answer, so  that I can understand.  But can anybody ever understand?  This is an  extra-ordinary book that confirms to us, the children who were not involved  and yet carry a tremendous guilt, that we will never be able to free  ourselves from that guilt.
1573225517|5.0|This book does justice for music lovers and those who have gone through the trials of falling in and out of love.  Hornby writes with humor and flair that is rarely seen in modern writers.
0684867621|2.0|This one reads as if someone put a stopwatch on King &amp; said, &quot;You have 24 hours to write a story. Setting: girl lost in the woods. Ready, GO!&quot; 24 hours later, this is what we get. Hard to believe there are so  many errors in a piece this short.  It is still an engaging read -- Steve  can spin a yarn.  The other thing that kept me going was the knowledge,  gained from reading King for almost 20 years now, that he has been known to  kill off the kid and end the story tragically (see Cujo).  That knowledge  left the outcome uncertain, right up to the end. But this is a  disappointing work, considering that King had gotten back to producing at  least a few worthwhile pieces (Green Mile, Desperation, Storm of the  Century) in the past few years after years of complete crap (Insomnia,  Delores Claiborne, Gerald's Game).
B00000IOSU|5.0|MAN! I'm so glad I went out and bought this album. My only complaint is the lack of earlier material...but Sarah is in top form (as always) on this album! Check it out!
B000005S37|5.0|The only album ever conceived that combines east coast nihilism with the west coast singer song-writter tradition.  When will the muzak version appear???
0446343129|4.0|This book shows that numerous ills of refined sugar(sucrose).  It is an extremely important book because it represents the first step in a realization that sucrose is much worse for you than the billion-dollar  sugar industry wants you to believe.  There are very important statistics  and valid points hidden among a text which is not very cohesive.  It is  rather like stream of consciousness in its style and almost paranoid in its  feel, but it remains an important read for beginning to unravel the sugar  myth.
B000003TA4|4.0|&quot;Lounge Act&quot;, for no apparent reason is my favorite song on this album. It is perhaps the essence of what Kurdt and co. were trying to achieve with this album: catchy hooks, and gut-wrenching screaming.  Overall, a fun album, and not nearly as good or as bad as everyone says...
B000000FG8|5.0|This album is the definition of skateboarding in  the early 90's. featuring in videos by new deal and planet earth. Comming from England being able to get this album is a first and at this price a miricle.
0684867621|2.0|I bought this book because my realtor's name is Tom Gordon and I was selling my house.  I like a lot of Stephen King's work, but this one just didn't keep me interested.  I did finish the book, so it wasn't awful, but  I didn't care about the main character at the end.  I could tell there was  plenty of research done, and some of it was interesting, but my overall  take is that somebody can have my copy.  Unfortunately, the realtor  wouldn't take the book off my hands!
0767819594|5.0|This movie has it all. It does not play to just one sex because both sexes continue to upstage the other. From the very beginning it is hard to tell who is the puppet and who is the master. I highly recommend this movie. One  of the a few good movies made this year.
0780624890|5.0|Blade has the very best opening sequence I have ever seen in any film.  Just the thought of dancing in BLOOD is very cool and Blades appearance and subsequent killing spree makes it fantastic to watch.  Wesley Snipes is in  fantastic form and brings a Comic Book hero to life in a way that it should  be.  Blade is the film that Batman, Spawn and the like should have been.   Stephen Dorff is also excellent as Frost and moves through the film will a  coolness that rivals Snipes.  Kristoffesen also has a very good, cynical  &quot;can't stand vampires&quot; cameo.  The best feature of the film  though is the sheer style and fluid nature of it.  From the outset, if you  watch carefully, the &quot;vampire&quot; characters move slightly  differently, the scenes are choreographed in a very comic book style, fluid  and smooth.  The characters represent those portrayed in the comic book as  well, this is Punisher meets Batman and no remorse, there is no time for  worrying about hurting the bad guys. On the down side the plot does get a  little stretched, it tries to incorporate too many plot lines in too short  a time.  The silliest being the Dr's &quot;cure&quot; for vampirism which  was a little annoying.  On the whole though this is a fabulously executed  and well played comic book yarn that leaves you satisfied come the end.  If  you only see one film this decade, forget Star Wars, see Blade.
B000001IPL|5.0|I got this CD a year ago when I heard Come out and Play and Bad Habit. I still cna't get enough of this Album. Every song is good. It's great at parties, just play this whole CD, and it's perfect.
B000002HMH|4.0|All of you people out there who hate this CD should definitely give it another chance!  I agree with the music fan from Melbourne, Australia that Metallica changed with the Black album.  And yet, when I read the reviews  for that album, for the most part, they were all enthusiastic!  Why weren't  there any cries of sellout back then???  Why are there cries of sellout  now???  Yeah, &quot;Load&quot; is alot more alternative metal with a  looser, groovier, more bluesy feel, but SO WHAT! (pun intended)  In my  opinion, this CD is better than the Black album.  Metallica have once again  matured to a new level.  The best songs include &quot;Ain't My B****&quot;,  &quot;2 X 4&quot;, &quot;King Nothing&quot;, &quot;Hero Of The Day&quot;,  &quot;Until It Sleeps&quot;, and &quot;The Outlaw Torn&quot;.  Let's face  it, a band will change its style for the better.  And that is the case for  Metallica!
B000001ABD|5.0|My Cherie Amour,  I Just Call to Say I Love You,  Lately, Stay Gold, and For Your Love are enough to  tell you he is the greatest melody maker of this era.  They'll also show you his lyrics are absolutely beautiful and  profound. Listen to them and be ROMANTIC!
B000002JSJ|4.0|I COULDN'T GIVE THIS ALBUM 5 STARS SINCE I GAVE MY FAVORITE ALBUM, LED ZEPPELIN II FIVE.  THIS ALBUM HAS GREAT SONGS SUCH AS &quot;NOBODY'S FAULT BUT MINE&quot;, &quot;ACHILLES LAST STAND&quot;, AND &quot;ROYAL  ORLEANS&quot;.
B00000IGGA|4.0|I like Tom Waits a lot. His beatnik rock and jazz is explosive, it's really danceable and very listenable after a few spins. Rain Dogs it one of the best records of all time! Lately, I've been frustrated by his  brecht-like excursions and overly sentimental ballads (Frank's Wild Years,  yucch!). There is some of that with this record. But mostly just great  songs, great arrangments. A lot of music here!
B000002J03|5.0|THIS ALBUM WAS THE BEST LED ZEPPELIN ALBUM EVER.  EVEN THOUGH LED ZEPPELIN IV GETS ALL THE HYPE, IT STILL HAS AT LEAST A COUPLE NOT-SO-GREAT SONGS.  ALL OF THE SONGS IN LED ZEPPELIN II ARE WORTH LISTENING TO OVER AND OVER.   SONGS LIKE &quot;HEARTBREAKER&quot; AND &quot;WHOLE LOTTA LOVE&quot; ARE  CLASSICS.  ONE OF MY FAVORITE LED ZEPPELIN SONGS EVER IS THE NOT-SO-POPULAR  &quot;BRING IT ON HOME&quot;.  IT STARTS OUT SLOW BUT ENDS IN GREAT LED  ZEPPELIN FASHION.  THIS IS EASILY LED ZEPPELIN'S BEST ALBUM EVER.
0792151712|1.0|This film should only be shown to 14 year old girls whose vocabulary consist of &quot;like&quot;, &quot;y'know&quot;, and &quot;kewl&quot;.  As in, &quot;Like, y'know, Titanic was so kewl&quot;.  Other than the lousy  direction, juvenile writing and amateurish acting, it didn't have anything  going for it.  Comparing it to &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is like   comparing &quot;Love Story&quot; to &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;. <br />A fine  actress like Kate Winslet should be embarrassed by this tripe.
B000002P5R|2.0|After reading all of the reviews on-line here, I bought this cd.  I love Jimi and have all three original studio albums, plus Jimi Hendrix: Blues (which is a great cd!). However, I was a little dissapointed with First  Rays of the New Rising Sun.  A lot of the songs seem unfinished and I don't  think the music is nearly as listenable as some of his other stuff. It's  too bad Jimi didn't live to finish this music...perhaps it should've just  remained unrealesed.
0670881791|5.0|This is a wonderful book, a fairy tale for adults about a good woman with a troubled past who arrives in a small French village and improves the quality of the lives of the inhabitants by teaching them to live for today,  and to enjoy one of the greatest of joys, chocolate. Full of mystery and  passion, the write is exquisite. There isn't a word out of place. If you  love to be carried away on a pastoral summer breeze, this book is perfect.  IT's a truly lovely, sweet story, not overly sweet..just nicely done.
B000002KIE|5.0|Sure, The Pistols were as calculated a marketing effort as The Spice Girls but at least they knew that and admitted it as loudly as possible--when such an admission was still daring.  This album has some amazing tunes on  it, especially &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, and its influence cannot be  overstated.  Worth owning for its cultural significance and at least three  tracks that are as powerful as any music created since The Velvet  Underground disbanded.
0375707972|4.0|I found this book oddly mesmerizing.  It's an unusual story
B000002MUQ|4.0|This was the height of Van Hagar-Halen.  Easily the best album since 5150 and light years better than VH 3.
B00000J7S8|5.0|This CD is great.  I've been a fan of Diana for several years and this album is just as good as the others.  Her beautiful voice along with the quality musicians on this album make it a joy to listen to.  I just bought  this album and I've already listened to it about 10 times.  Buy it, you  won't be sorry!
0380973464|4.0|Great book.  I specially enjoyed learning all about how we broke the German and Japanese codes in WWII.  Great history lesson in the process.  Exposed me to a new and interesting topic that I had no clue (no pun, :)).   Makes me want to read more about WWII.<br />The other parallel story in the  book that takes place in modern times is interesting but a little  disjointed.  Seems like NS changed his mind of where he wanted to take it  half-way through it.  It goes from being Crypt centric to gold and love  story.  NS could have milked the Crypt angle a lot more.  Interesting idea  that could have been better explored.<br />Overall, I think it is definitely  worth reading it.  You will enjoy it.
080018789X|1.0|This is the most overrated movie ever.  Glorified soap opera with a few sports stars to make it easier to convince the men to be dragged to this stupid, sappy idiotic piece of garbage ever to be put on film.  Made me  wanna barf.  Buyer BEWARE!
B00000ICD9|5.0|I have had the book What Dreams May Come by Richard Matheson since it was first published, and read it many times over the years. It has helped more than one friend come to terms with death, as a change of life, rather than  an end, and the necessity of concentrating one's life on the things that  are truly important. The movie is simply astounding. It adheres to the book  in all the most important aspects, and does so with the most beautiful  cinematography and special effects I have ever seen. This is not a  special-effects movie; it is a film about life and death and love, and all  of the wonderful scenery is only enhancement.  On the DVD, there is an  alternate ending, which is more in tune with the original ending in the  book, and which, to me, is better. The ending which the producers decided  was more acceptable I found too saccharine and not in tune with the rest of  the story. Matheson wrote a perfect story, and to try and change his ending  to a happy-happy one was, in my mind, an error which disrupted the whole  climate of the film. See the DVD, and judge for yourselves.
0440224764|3.0|The first 100 pages were interesting as he introduced characters.  He doesn't just give you all the details at once, but gives bits and pieces throughout the book.  The second 100 pages were pretty boring and I almost  didn't finish the book.  Then for the last half it got more and more  interesting as everything came together.  I would have rated it 4, but it  had a terrible ending.  In fact, I wish I hadn't even read the last  chapter.  It made absolutely no sense at all and just ruined my impression  of the book.  I don't know what Grisham was thinking but I was certainly  let down.
0451450523|5.0|This wonderful tale is the haphazard story of two misfits and their unicorn, the last of her kind.  In an effort to help her find the rest of the lost unicorns, Schmendrick the Magician,  &quot;The last of the red-hot  swamies,&quot; transforms the unicorn into a human.  Yet, when she reaches  the one place the unicorns can be found, she loses her heart.  Will she  choose immortality over love?
630471288X|5.0|This story is told beautifully.  It was, even though it took place in a prison, photographed beautifully.  Morgan Freeman was as usual riveting as &quot;Red&quot;.  Tim Robbins also is great in his greatest role to date.   All the actors performed brilliantly and add to the richness of the story.    Especially &quot;this man's about to have an accident&quot; Clancy Brown  as the guard. It's very disheartening to me that the Academy chose to award  &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; with the Best Picture award.  That one was nothing  more than a glorified soap opera, no lasting substance at all.  Shawshank  should have ran away with that one.  Shawshank is right up there with  &quot;Amadeus&quot; as my personal all time favorites.   The 147 minutes  just fly by and you don't want it to end.  A great drama all around.   Without any car chases, explosions or sappy love story.  Although it is  about love and friendship,  it's never corny.  <br />Perfect.  Bravo! to those  responsible for making this masterpiece.  We want more.
6302990114|4.0|Awash with the kind of star-studded cast that the 'nineties simply cannot muster, this entertaining whodunnit lacks real menace, but has a humour and charm that make the voyage worthwhile.
6300151379|5.0|god, what can i say, this is a magical movie.  i'm a 17 year old male and i LOVE this movie. David Bowie is a god, and he is a terribly good actor.  This is a story that will definitely capture audiences of all ages.  The  fantasy in it is just awesome, and the characters, and the story itself,  it's just a great movie. 2 magical thumbs up!
0780625129|5.0|This movie did not follow any formula and kept me and my husband riveted to the screen. Glorification of either side was not made and one of the excellent qualities of the movie was that one could somewhat emphathize  with both sides. The characters were complex, not the typical one  dimensional cardboard figures generally onscreen. Additionally, this film  mirrors reality as much as any movie possibly can. But because of that,  this movie is incredibly intense and has extremely graphic sex and  violence. And don't forget to have your tissue handy; even my husband  cried!
0451160916|2.0|I love the movie but friends kept telling me it doesn't do the book justice and that I really should read it.  So I thought, hey, I'm willing to try anything once, even Stephen King, but boy, was I disappointed with  this novel.<br />It started out promising enough with just enough metaphors,  motifs and compulsive thinking to keep things interesting and spooky but  about half way through the book (about the time all that supernatural stuff  gets going) King begins hammering the reader over the head with  heavy-handed allusions and repeated references as though he's afraid we  won't get it.<br />Maybe it's just that I don't have much tolerance for or  interest in magical thinking but I found the last half of the book tedious  bordering on  silly.  To my mind, the scariest part of the book by far was  something that could have happened in real life -- the episode with the  wasps nest in Danny's room.  But I also think that the things real human  beings are capable of doing to each other are far more horrifying than  anything involving an elevator that moves on it's own, background ballroom  music, the whirring machinations of a wind-up clock or a hotel taking over  the body and mind of a sad, pathetic, middle-aged man.
B000002AH1|5.0|It should be illegal to make music this fonkay.<br />Be sure to check out 'Get Up with It,' the OTHER great early-70s album. Import though.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Sad songs, happy songs, angry songs, and &quot;puffy&quot; cloud-like songs. Steady melodic bass lines + Crackling drumwork + Brilliantly written solos + Billy Corgan's musical genieus + James Iha's musical talent=Siamese  Dreams.Billy, James, Jimmy, and D'arcy take you on a bullet train to the  human sole. This album contains the embodyment of every emotion you will  ever feel. Sadness, love, anger, meloncholly, glee, and even awe(as in the  awe of the album's power).James' guitar pick flys over the strings as he  unleashes the beautiful solos. Jimmy's snare drum echos the beat of  D'arcy's lullabying bass. Billy's voice goes from deep and sad, to loud and  angry, to high and sweet. The Pumpkins are the best in the buisiness. This  album is great in the car, at parties, or just to rock you to sleep.  As a  music fan I can't sing its praises enough. As a guitar player, musician,  and a song writer, I have never been more inspired! - Tim(california,  U.S.A.)
B000001EAQ|5.0|This is the best U2 album ever. It's different, not necessarily for Joshua Tree fans, but great nonetheless.
0784010919|5.0|I loves this movie. I have one of the 1987 vesions, and it is great! <br />My favorite character is Baby because she is just like me. We are both head strong and do nothing to stand in the way of what we want.<br />The best scene  is that at the end when Johnny tells her how much he cares for her in her  in his own way, and the dancing they did was sensational. I am glad that  she brought this movie on sale! <br />Anyone who wants to see the dramatic  impact that one person can have on your life then you should go and see  Dirty Dancing!
0380973464|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Stephenson's engaging novel. This despite the typos. The strength of the novel is the way plots are interlaced and in the power of description, specially the scenes in Manila. I am from Manila and I must  say that NS managed to capture the sensory elements that are very hard to  describe.<br /> Overall a good read with a pulsing buildup. Loved The  technology angles.
B000002AHM|5.0|I'm an atheist, but the music contained in this album is the strongest evidence that there is a God that I've heard yet.  Where else can this come from other than from heaven?  Listen intently, let the music flow through  you.  It will grab your soul, drag it along for a roller coaster ride,  fling you up and down, left and right.  On several occasions, I forgot to  breathe.  Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.  I must have listened to Rio  Ancho a million times.
0671004107|4.0|I read this book after I saw the movie.  There were a lot of holes in the plot of the movie, I figured that it's a good idea to find out what's this all about.<br />I finished the book in two days.  It's a difficult book, with  a lot of technical terms and jargons.  But generally, it's a very good  sci-fi book which stirs up your imagination.  It encourages you to look at  the sky at night and ponder about life.<br />I am shocked by Sagan's knowledge  about the history and culture of many other countries, like China, India,  Nigeria, and former USSR.  If you have read his Dragons of Eden, you will  find that he knew a lot about evolution, animal behaviors and psychology  too.<br />Two problems exist though.  He was not very good at dramatizing the  important events, like the death of Drumlin, making the flow of story not  very exciting.  Another one was his use of love at the very end of the  book, was that necessary?
6305095566|5.0|Sam Raimi's quite underrated zombie masterpiece is based on a number of teenagers who spend the weekend at one of their uncle's house.  Unknowingly,  they release a curse from a tape recorder left at the house  with a professor's voice on it,  reading from a book of the dead that he  had found.  When the words on the tape are spoken by the professor,  the  evil curse is unleashed,  terrorizing the teenagers and gradually turning  them into the walking dead.  Unlike the usuall cliche in most zombie  movies,   these zombies don't eat human flesh.  Despite the poor quality of  the footage,  &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; has wonderful make-up special  effects.  Even though this is no &quot;Night Of The Living Dead&quot;,   &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; is sure to entertain and scare the viewers who  watch it in generations to come.
B00000JCB2|1.0|The band that would be Korn, except there already was a band called that is back with more wax for the white male 17-24 fraternity crowd. &quot;Oh, wow this is like the best thing to happen to me since like, Ozzfest!&quot;
B000001E18|3.0|Zooropa is a solid album, but definately not for those who are just starting to get into U2.  Highlights include:  &quot;Babyface,&quot;  &quot;Far Away, So Close,&quot;  &quot;Daddy's Gonna Pay,&quot; and  &quot;The Wanderer.&quot;<br />But dont take the album too seriously.
6304913176|5.0|OK, OK, so the acting sucked, but so did Star Wars's (NO, I&quot;M NOT COMPARING STAR WARS TO THIS MOVIE, JUST THE ACTING), &amp; there was some pointless nudity, but this movie kicks ***!! (rhymes with bass) Special  effects are killer, it made me laugh my *** off, &amp; the battles were  cool too. Oh yeah, the book was better though, but it is a whole different  expierience.
B000001EAQ|2.0|U2's anticlimactic, flimsy beats and rythums, coupled with Bono's lazy, lackluster lyrics (&quot;your holy war/ your northern star/ your sermon on the mount/ in the boot of your car...&quot;), make POP sound more like  POOP.  PLEASE give us a break guys!  You are rock icons.  Start acting like  it!
006017322X|5.0|This book is unlike any other book I've ever read and I'm only a 13 year old. Harper Lee is a genius. I truly enjoyed this book to the very last page. I highly reccomend it to anybody who is longing for a good book.
6305265488|5.0|Feel good film! Cinderella told with some new twists to make it fresh and fun. Romantic but not sappy. Appealing cast, good costumes, I'd see it again.
B00000J7JO|3.0|I've listened to this a few times and what strikes me is how uneven the record is.  It seems like the boys are torn between rocking out and the &quot;mature&quot; sound that all the bands which used to rock out  eventually seem to settle on.  They get it right on a few songs -- I'm in  agreement with the majority on &quot;Scar Tissue&quot; and  &quot;Californication.&quot;  But Porcelain?  Are you kidding me?  Boring.   10 years ago any one of the Chilis would have quit on principle if you had  told them they had to record that song.<br />I still dig Frusciante's guitar  playing and most of the album is decent.  A worthwhile record to own but  definitely not one of the best records ever, or of the year for that  matter.  Of course, I do realize that (according to that one guy who  reviewed the album) the fact that I don't love it means that I don't have  an ear for music.  Oh well.
B00000IL1K|5.0|Except for her upper register, Sarah Brightman has one of the most cloying 'classically trained' voices around. As each year passes, her style and presentation become more and more outrageous. At times, I wonder if she's  deliberately spoofing herself and the world of classical music --- but when  you see her in performance she seems so very serious about what she's  doing.  This couldn't possibly be a joke, could it ?  That said, I'm   weirdly mesmerized by 'Eden' --- kinda like a lemming drawn to the sea.  I  can't stop playing this thing ! It's absolutely the most alarming,  overblown mish mash of styles --- everything from electronica to Italian  opera to new age.  Sarah, you're on to something.  And I think you're  probably the only one who can pull it off.  It's so bad, it's actually  great !
1559408898|5.0|This was a great movie the first time I saw it.  This Criterion Collection &quot;Director's Cut&quot; is even better- gorrier and more comic bookish.  I don't see why it wasn't origonally released this way. Well, actually I  do. . .because I listened to the very interesting commentary by the  director and producer provided.  Like I said before, &quot;What More Could  You Ask For?&quot;  Go get this.
0790701251|3.0|I am the largest-scale fan of Kubrick one can fathom.... A Clockwork Orange and 2001 changed my life... but this is just your basic '80's war movie, I don't think it was so good.
6305428557|5.0|As usual, Maltin completely misses the point. This is far from being a a one-joke movie. Watch it and you will see why so many people loved it.
6305358613|4.0|While I was not particularly pleased by the script as a whole, Cate Blanchard's acting is a sight to see.  She can really put it out there!  I wish the script had focused more on her and Geoffery Rush's  characters'  relationship; they had the best chemistry of the entire movie.  The other  acting was very routine in comparison to these two.  The sets and costumes  were terrific, as was the cinematography.  However, the script needed a lot  work on the characters' emotional and cognitive transitions; decisions were  made that didn't seem to fit the context of the story.  The DVD transfer  was good, as were the extras that were included in the package (good, but  not great).  A good rental.
0385493800|2.0|The Testament isn't as bad as Grisham's last two books, but that's not saying very much.  The characters are one-dimensional at best, the plot is non-existant, and, worst of all, there's no real suspense.  If you want a  decent Grisham book, try The Rainmaker.  If you want a decent novel of  personal redemption, search for a copy of Island, by Charles Abbott.  But  don't bother reading this book unless you feel driven to read absolutely  everything written by Grisham.  The publishers are obviously aware that  there are plenty of people in that camp, at this point...
B00000J7S8|5.0|Diana Krall is Canada's greatest musical gift to the world and she has gifted us in a magnificent with &quot;When I Look In Your Eyes&quot;.<br />The impeccable choice of material coupled with her incomparable voice backed by  world-class musicians(including Diana herself) makes this CD a regular in  my rotation of consistent listening material.<br />Thanks to Canada for the  gift of Diana!!
6302720419|5.0|Motoko says: This one makes the list for sentimental reasons. I saw it a year after it came out and I couldn't sleep that night. Also, it has the plot of Stephen King, who makes up some messed up stuff to begin with.  &quot;Why'd you have to go and mess with 'em, Jake?&quot;
6302968135|5.0|This was a breakthrough for Mexican-American filmmaking.  If anyone is intrested in witnessing how the life of three individuals from the barrio develop and how their friendship evolved into a epic  story!
B000005J56|5.0|This CD is excellent, and &quot;Dos Gardenias&quot; very special
B00000I9MK|5.0|The count down has begun. Tigermilk is on its way, another album may follow, but after that no one knows. They had a fight on stage in Dublin, Stuart was reduced to tears and as a result they may never play again. What  will we do now? Belle &amp; Sebastian don't forsake us!
6305268177|5.0|This was my second DVD purchase and the sound and picture quality were awesome.  First purchase was Fleetwood Mac, The Dance, and that was also a five star performance.  Wish I could find one for Dave Matthews.
B00000IOSU|5.0|Well what can I say? The woman can do no wrong. Mirrorball takes you on a journey of how live albums SHOULD sound: Clear and unbelievably awesome. Mirrorball covers alot of Surfacing and Fumbling with one song from Solace.  I have been a fan for 6 years and she just gets better and better. One  thing that struck me was how great &quot;I Love You&quot; sounded which was  one of the songs that were &quot;okay&quot; on Surfacing.  This version is  just great.  I'll see you at Lilith this summer Sarah!
0380973464|4.0|I found this highly promoted book initially quite interesting, especially the cult of crypto, but by the middle of the book it was getting bogged down and muddled with the myriad plot lines, and references to the myriad  plot lines by the author to make sure we we are aware how clever he was in  creating this complex web of interactions. But ultimately I must admit I  found myself growing bored, and just stopped reading. Upon reflection I  found myself disappointed that the author had tried so much but failed in  the most crucial task, engaging the reader and creating a story that  propels you forward. But oddly enough I will still recommend this book to  others, as maddening as the book became, because the sheer audacity of the  leaps the author makes is worth the price of admission.
6305311463|1.0|More proof that special effects cannot carry a movie alone.  Why did Criterion decide to add this tired genre movie to it's collection?  If you ever want to know whats wrong with big budget movies, this is a perfect  example. Stereotypical charactrers, thin on plot, and a truck load  of(welldone) special effects. Get 2001 instead.
B000001FA4|5.0|Este album es impresionante. Junto con Joshua Tree es de lo mejor de U2 y no vale la pena devanarse los sesos tratando de averiguar cual de los 2 es mejor porque tanta belleza no puede ser medida objetivamente. Es mejor  disfrutarlos.<br /> De las 10 canciones la unica que no es digna de merecer el  titulo de excelencia es 4th of July. Pero aguanta cuando escuchas el album  completo.<br /> Todas las demas son sublimes: Homecoming, MLK, Summer Sky son  excelentes. La guitarra cristalina de Promenade casi se siente llorar y el  frenesi de Wire hace levantar los pies del suelo.<br /> De Pride y  Unforgettable Fire ni que decir, ambas son clasicos y su musicalizacion no  tiene defectos. Cada una hace sentir una faceta diferente con sus letras:  Pride, la ira, el deseo de levantarse ante todo. Fire, el romanticismo del  amor no correspondido, el amor que no muere...<br /> Bad es una de las  canciones mas apasionadas que haya escuchado (can´t let it go). Las  alusiones a la vida sin Vida, al &quot;si pudiera&quot;, a desvanecerse  pueblan este sueño clandestino que pocas veces un grupo puede lograr  plasmar en una cancion.<br /> Por ultimo tenemos Elvis Prsley and America.  Obviando el titulo esta es una gema. Elvis no se aparece por aca y America  no abarca suficiente para esta joya. Sin embargo, he leido que a algunas  personas no les gusta. Tal vez porque es algo incoherente (incluso para  personas que tienen el ingles como lengua materna) pero eso no importa  tanto. ¿Que nadie se da cuenta que esta cancion narra una dulce venganza?  Bits and pieces on this floor... Tal vez la unica manera de que la venganza  sea dulce. Y la musica te hace palpitar al igual que el choque de  sentimientos narrado por la cancion.<br /> La musica y las liricas  indescriptibles, Bono apasionado e inigualable y Edge con su guitarra  infinita hacen de este album una de las maximas expresiones de la musica  contemporanea.
B000002UA2|1.0|I am a recent recruit to the ranks of PF fandom, I can listen to Division Bell, Meddle,Animals, Momentary Lapse..... and much of  &quot;The Wall&quot; BUT      &quot;obscured by clouds&quot; is a waste of talent and  money. I amazed they made it out of the 70s peddling this kind of lame and  mediocre stuff. I bought it here at Amazon 6/14/99     and was going to  throw it in the trash........ The first email to me gets it for free, no  strings attached.........Rod Heathcote
0451198670|1.0|I bought The Love Letter because of all the positive press. I'd just finished reading Wally Lamb's I Know This Much Is True, a fairly weighty 900-page saga, and was looking for something light, fresh and romantic.  Unfortunately, I did not find what I was looking for in The Love Letter;  every character was embellished beyond belief - no one had a simple thought  or action. I put the book down before reaching the halfway mark and  consider it a waste of money.
0385493622|5.0|make it this one. Take it from someone who read all three by Singh, vos Savant, and Aczel, this one is the best-written. One has to wonder, though, if Singh didn't plagiarize the earlier effort by Aczel - same flow, same  anecdotes, same diagrams.  Does anyone know how to get a hold of the BBC  documentary?  For you math-lovers, another good one is &quot;e: The Story  of a Number.&quot;
0790736233|4.0|I'll give this movie four stars for its incredible cinematography and special effects, for the luminous performance by Oscar-winner Jodie Foster, and for its creative way of expressing one of the greatest philosophical  dilemmas of the modern world...the relationship between science and faith.   While I thoroughly disagree with much of the philosophical ideas that the  movie promotes, I commend the filmmakers for this artistic triumph.
B000002BVN|5.0|The new songs on this collection are nothing but outtakes from past albums. &quot;Blood on the Dance Floor&quot; was originally recorded for the Dangerous album along with around 55 unreleased tracks,  &quot;Morphine&quot;, &quot;Superfly Sister&quot; and &quot;Is it  Scary&quot; were recorded for the History album and &quot;Ghosts&quot; was  just built around &quot;Is it Scary&quot; for the Ghosts film in 1996. It  is still a great album though. He has to release an album of outtakes with  songs like &quot;Circus Girl&quot;, &quot;Hot Street&quot;,  &quot;Niteline&quot;, &quot;Trouble&quot;, &quot;The Toy&quot; &amp;  &quot;Can't Get Outta the Rain&quot;.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I've been looking forward to this album since I first heard &quot;Thank You&quot; on the Sliding Doors soundtrack, and much to my surprise Dido's debut album &quot;No Angel&quot; is very good.  Amidst a sea of anonymous  Lilith Fair sound-alikes and recent one-hit wonders, Dido's refreshing  tapestry of electronic beats effortlessly blended into more traditional  melodies stands high above the rest.  If I had to compare her to other more  established artists, I'd say her music resembles that of Sarah McLachlan  with a twist of Everything But the Girl thrown in for good measure.  My  favorite tracks right now are &quot;Hunter&quot;, &quot;Don't Think of  Me&quot; (both great breakup tunes), and &quot;I'm No Angel&quot;.  I don't  know if this album has what it takes to make it big in the mainstream, but  that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  A very solid debut indeed.
0871137380|1.0|It's like reading the newspaper
B000000OE7|4.0|that mad the swine from southern california is a idiot this disk is good.yeah its not the best from queen but its still is good.the remake of &quot;made in heaven&quot; is just superb that alone with a lot of other  decent songs make this a disk worth getting.
B00000J631|3.0|It sounds like such a cool idea!  Wow!  101 songs all under :30 long.<br />That is... until you listen to it.  I'm all for nice quick punk blasts... but it gets old 30 or 40 songs into the disc.
6300213005|5.0|Robocop is a leading contender in the &quot;Most violent movie ever made&quot; sweepstakes.  With that warning in mind, those who are still willing to indulge (and those who can stomach the gore) will find a bleakly  funny, savage, snorting sci-fi behemoth which represents, along with Total  Recall, Paul Verhoeven's filmmaking peak.  (And now on to Basic Instinct  and Showgirls...)<br />I've done a comparison of the screenplay to this one  and the final product.  My verdict is that Verhoeven really pushed the  right buttons in the changes he made.  The Clarence/Robocop showdown is  excellently filmed and staged, the characterization on the money (Nancy  Allen's tough lady cop and Peter Weller's arrow-straight family man turned  metal giant are well matched).  Don't forget the humour as well:  &quot;I'd  buy that for a dollar&quot;; ED-209's humiliating blunders; Kurtwood  Smith's gleeful sleaze.<br />But it's longtime Verhoeven favourite Ronny Cox  who impressed me the most in this and Total Recall.  He finds the  complexities in his villain roles, never quite lapsing into megalomania  even when he's shouting and making villainous threats, finding the human  motivations behind the worst of villains.<br />Excellent set design, special  effects and dialogue round off this apocalyptic late-'80s masterpiece.   Make yourself a cast-iron stomach, take a deep breath and dive in.
B00000F1D3|5.0|This CD is an excallent combination of music.  The track &quot;Believe&quot; is an excellent song that shows Cher's talent
6303965415|4.0|Upon first watching this Austen adaptation, I was disappointed with the lack of interaction between the two main characters. However, when watching a second time, I appreciated more the subtleties. Amanda Root and Ciaran  Hinds (especially Hinds) were perfectly cast, and the movie definitely  deserves more than one look. Though it starts slow, it is worth it to stick  with it until the end. As another reviewer said, it is better each time  around. For the reviewer from Denver who is interested in other Ciaran  Hinds' works, may I suggest A&amp;E's Jane Eyre. He is more than  outstanding!!
0380973464|5.0|Neal Stephenson's &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; is  both a great story and the most insightful commentary on our society now in print. Readers who have experienced the award winning &quot;Snowcrash&quot; and &quot;Zodiac&quot;  will be familiar with Stephenson's ability to create fascinating  characters, tell an imaginative yarn in an ironic voice and sprinkle in  some caustic social commentary along the way. That talent is evident in  &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, as well.  But there is more, much more.  This  novel tells a gripping story about buried treasure, high tech corporate  intrigue and code breaking spanning three generations.  But that  description might describe any one of a dozen potboilers we might read on  an airplane and forget as soon as we set them down.  THIS IS NOT THAT KIND  OF BOOK.  It is this use of generations where this work stands out.  His  characters are at once flesh and blood and icons of and for their  respective generations.  Reviewers have in the past compared Stephenson's  style to that of Thomas Pynchon and truly this book can only be compared to  &quot;Gravity's Rainbow&quot;.  But where Pynchon's novel might be said to  have told a story about the Boomer generation set in the milieu of WWII,  Stephenson tells a story about all three generations beginning in WWII.   Neal Stephenson has written a transcendant work.  This is a real must read.
B00000IL1K|5.0|One of the best combinations of voice, instrumentals, and flowing emotions I have ever heard.  Brava, Sarah!
B0000024SD|5.0|This is one of Dylan's best albums, and one of the most important of the sixties, as he suddenly shifted from straight folk to some rock elements, with stunning results. Moody and quintissentially American, this music has  a lot of heart beneath its offbeat humor and rambling lyrics. &quot;It's  All Over Now Baby Blue&quot; is particularly effective.
B00000JCB3|5.0|I've been following the LB's music since the release of their first album and their now my favorite band.Even though I've only heard the tracks &quot;Nookie&quot; and &quot;I'm Broke&quot; I know Significant  Other is  gonna kick ***.The track &quot;I'm Broke&quot;,I believe,is very  reminiscent of R.A.T.M.I also am excited to hear their collaborations with  Method Man,Eminem,Scott Weiland,and Jonathan Davis
6305265488|5.0|This was a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful story.  It took me back to my childhood.  I found myself cheering for the romance!!  The scene with her in her wings was unforgettable!!  A definite MUST SEE!!
0792152328|1.0|So many people loved this movie and raved about it .  Boy was I disappointed.   A movie can not stand on special effects alone in my opinion.  I did enjoy the begining, but when the boat started sinking, I  just wanted to turn it off.  I FORCED myself to finish it.  I guess  watching all those people suffer and die just doesn't appeal to me.  Leo  was a '90's kind of guy in the wrong era, not believable, and certainly not  Oscar worthy.  How sad for &quot;As Good as it Gets&quot; and &quot;Good  Will Hunting&quot; that this horrible movie got best picture above them.
B00000IOSU|5.0|Sarah is one of those artists that I can honestly say sounds better live than recorded and this only proves my point! I have seen her in concert several times and this is as close as it gets to actually being in the  audience. Now I can rock out to her live, but in my car!! A definite must  have for any Sarah McLachlan fan or anyone who just enjoys great music.
B000002LGQ|5.0|Madonna has talent! Her two decades of success can prove it. She puts the &quot;va&quot; in &quot;diva&quot;. This is probably her best album. With songs like &quot;Like A Prayer&quot;, &quot;Dear Jessie&quot;, and  &quot;Act Of Contrition&quot;, this album is proves once and for all that  Madonna is the queen of pop music. Many have tried, but none can top her  success and talent. Her endless creativity with her music and videos have  made her an eternal diva!
0783113943|5.0|Who's ever wanted to be a model?  This movie gives us a chance to look at the other side of beauty... always put out for show; always picked apart on film; never quite enough after you've given it all to the camera.  What is  captured on film is not always what is behind closed doors.  This movie  dealt expertly with the problems Gia encountered after her rise to fame and  her inability to cope with herself away from the public eye.  Her overt  sexuality and very obvious drug use brought to light a very complex and sad  life.  Anjelina Jolie not only looked like Gia's twin, but she played the  part to absolute perfection.  This was one of the best films I have ever  seen, so much so, I had to own it for my own collection.
6305171769|5.0|I have been a big fan of halloween for a long time. I felt all the sequels after 2 were horrible and should have gone straight to video or the trash can. When I heard they were making another and treating it as if the  sequels after 2 hadn't happened I was elated. The movie is great a true  delight for any Halloween fan. It shows that horror movie survivors don't  just recover after a year like Jennifer Love Hewitt in IKWYDLS. The scene  where Laurie Strode and the shape come face to face after 20 years is  priceless. I'd give it 10 stars!
0380973464|5.0|Exhaustively discriptive in a similar way to Tom Clancy, I could not put this book down.  I loved the way the story jumped between and successfully intertwined the WWII and present-day storylines, with all the main  characters represented in both generations.  The story itself was  mesmerizing.  I found myself laughing out loud at the dry humor of the  characters and the author's comically sarcastic descriptions of people,  places, and things. The third-person, present-tense style of writing feels  like the author is sitting in your living room telling the story to you  from personal experience.   I loved the hell out of this book, and look  forward to more if its true about it being the first in a series.
6303481345|5.0|This is a perfect movie. Non-stop action, beautiful animation and a storyline rivaled by few others make it one even for those not crazy about anime. A must have for any collector.
B000002KHH|5.0|Black Sabbath has to be one of the best bands ever. There nice up beat metal is really what gets most people going. They really struck gold when they made this CD! Some songs might be a bit lengthy but who cares?! The  more the better!!! Parranoid and Iron Man and War Pigs have to be the best  songs on there. Trust me this is a great cd and you should buy it.
B00000J7S8|5.0|Diana Krall is the greatest to come along in years with her sultry blend of blues and jazz. Her artistic talent shines with her sexy renditions and arrangements.  This album is great for romantic evenings; in fact, I am so  sold on her I want more!
B00000IOSU|5.0|this cd is amazing! the crowd interaction, the energy... it's just amazing! this is SOOOOO worth buying, i don't care what anyone else says, but sarah is a goddess... just listen to the version of Path of Thorns, and  Ice Cream, you will so agree...
6305365121|4.0|I really enjoyed Insurrection. Did anyone else pick up on the plot of government corruption and the citizens revolting. Or was it the little guys protecting the littler guys from the big bullies? I also thought I saw a  touch of WW2 in there, sacrafice a few to please the crowd. Isn't that what  we and our allies did when our governments divided up Europe after ww2?  Good for you Enterprise!! You are an example to us all! We don't learn from  our mistakes so hopefully we will learn from Star Trek!!!!!!
630280082X|5.0|A Classically trained Eugene goes on a quest with an old Blues Legend(Willie Brown) thinking He is going to get to record some lost songs of Robert Johnson, instead ,He ends up learning the valuable lesson of how  the blues came about. He learns that these legendary bluesman lived their  music.That's probably why they show Ralph coming from a schooled  environment. Books can only teach you so much about blues. The rest you  have to live. Then he has to cut heads with (Steve Vai) to save the sole of  his friend and himself.The last 10 minutes of the movie are the best. Arlon  Roth is the one who plays Ralphs part in the end, He and Steve Vai co-wrote  the &quot;head cutting&quot; music together. Ry Cooder did most if not all  of the original blues music. The most enspiring movie I've ever seen!!!!!
B000002J20|5.0|I've appreciated the music of Yes since 1970, both from the standpoint of audiophile and musician.   After 25 years since its release, TFTO needs no evangelical movement to bring it to the masses.  If you prefer your music  challenging and want more than 3 chords in 4/4 time, then THIS MASTERPIECE  WILL FIND YOU!  <br />Forget about whether or not it's &quot;as good as 'Close  to the Edge' or 'Fragile.'&quot;  Was Beethoven's 9th &quot;better&quot;  than his 5th, or Stravinsky's &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; better than   &quot;The Firebird?&quot;<br />Don't be surprised when Neo-Progressive music  arrives in force (there are signs already) and TFTO is acclaimed as a 20th  century masterpiece.<br />Maybe you've missed the first 25 years- don't miss  the next 25.  Get this one.
0679600019|5.0|this is the most beautifully written piece of literature i've ever read.  it makes you look at people and life in a whole new way.
B00000IJPU|5.0|This is probably my favorite music CD of all time. I do like some of the new bands that come out but they are nothing compared to this. My favorite song in the CD would have to be 'Fear of the Dark (Live)'. The music sample  only plays a small portion of the non-heavy part in the song. They probably  cut out the rest of the song as pose not to spoil the song.<br />The other  songs in it are great. Anyways, I reccomend you buy it!
6305428050|5.0|It's nice seeing some actors in younger days before they were &quot;famous&quot; - like Shue, Donofrio and others. Don't miss RAPP who later became the star of the Broadway hit RENT!
B00000ILE7|1.0|&quot;Alien 3&quot; is not nearly as good as &quot;Aliens,&quot; in fact, it is much worse. The problem is, the movie ran out of materials.
B0000067L3|5.0|To find Diamonds,tiny little rocks,one must dig through tons of rock. Here, in &quot;Spoonful&quot; you'll find the brightest Diamond in the history of rock.But where is it? Very easy.If you have a CD, and who  doesn't these days, fast forward to 2 minutes and fifty seconds into the  song,just after the vocals have ended. Continue listening till about the 8  minute mark. This is it. After you've heard this for several times it will  hit you. You will take off. Get in your car and blast this at maximum  volume. Be careful not to crash. Let me know what you think.
0380973464|5.0|Stephenson has an incredible talent for turning fundamental ideas (e.g. code breaking, currency, telecommunications) into a satisfying story full of colorful characters and lavish detail. He know what he's talking about  and knows how to draw you in.
B00000J7S8|4.0|This is a lush album, with strings galore, and overall it works very well.  There are some great readings of standards (Under My Skin, in particular) and contrary to some comments I've read, the strings add a nice dimension  to her performance. My biggest complaint, though, is that there's not  enough PIANO on this one.  Diana is above all a great piano player, and  while her voice is good, as she has said herself, she's not a singer by  training.  Nevertheless, this is a worthy addition to her catalog.  When do  we get a &quot;live&quot; one!?
B000002JS8|5.0|If an album was to be the first and last thing a person heard after birth and before death. This would be what I would want to hear!!! There is only one thing to say....  Thank You!!!
B000002NHN|5.0|From the first time I heard Loreena McKennit's work (The Bonny Swans from The Mask and the Mirror) I have been transported by her work. This CD simply illustrates the highest art to be found in current popular music.  Not only is the music wondrous, it is expanding the boundaries of popular  music... when I heard &quot;The Mummer's Dance&quot; on LA alternative  radio I knew it was more than a limited appeal single genre CD. I have  listened to this CD innumerable times over the past year, and it surprises  me with each new listen. When I learned that Ms. McKennitt also has created  her own label, has maintained almost unheard of artistic freedom AND has  become hugely successful, I was totally impressed. There is no other like  her... I count this CD among my indispensible things.
B000002JSZ|5.0|I've listened to this album for years. I believe this to be one of the best albums they ever made. They totally pushed all buttons themselves. This is for a true AC/DC fan.
630529142X|1.0|I've always liked Adam Sandler.  Being a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; fan, he has provided me with some of lifes funnier moments.  But unfortunately, it was &quot;The Waterboy&quot; that propelled him to  superstar status.  &quot;The Waterboy&quot; was a nothing of a film.  When  the best thing about the film is the tackling scenes, you know you've been  cheated.  &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot; is his best so far, in which he  plays a &quot;real&quot; person with sincerity. I'll be in line to see  &quot;Big Daddy&quot; as well, but I hope his character isn't as  onedimensionally stupid and gimmicky as the one he played in this film.
B00000J7S8|5.0|Unlike several of the other reviewers I read, I had never heard of Diana Krall.  I was flipping stations this past Sunday and  happened to stop on a syndicated jazz show.  They played the song, &quot;Let's Face the Music and  Dance,&quot; and I fell in love.  Later that same day I bought the CD, and  I have played it daily.  It is so soothing and relaxing that I feel as if  I'm floating while listening to her music.  I will now shop for earlier  releases.
B000002W5J|3.0|Why has RCA chose to come out with new updated and remastered versions of all of JA's 60's albums except this one!?....which happens to be their best and most classic! The music is great, but because it sounds like it was  recorded at the end of a bowling alley, I give this disc a 3....RCA, please  wake up!
6304147589|5.0|Yes, it's long.  Yes, it's slow.  Yes, you have to do some thinking to follow along.  But, gosh-gee, it's all worth it.  Incredibily beautiful and powerful use of film.  Thank you, Mr. Cimino.
B00000J7J4|5.0|I've listened to Santana for about 12 years now.  My favorite was Blues for Salvador.  This album will blow you away.  He showcases his tremoundous skill and throws in some superstars, and you have an album that should be  considered for Album of the Year!!!  If you love Santana you will love this  album, if you have not heard Santana, get this one and you will be a  listener for LIFE!!
0375408266|5.0|I was astonished to find Bernhard Schlink in the New York Times Bestsellerlist and would like to add the view of the German post-war generation. The moving and unsettling theme in this book is the question,  if we can forgive ourselves the love and the bond we feel for our  grandparents and parents allthough we know (or not know) about their share  of the happenings before and during the third Reich. It is easy to blame  &quot;the Nazis&quot; in general or the hanger-ons who gave them their  power and to dissociate from all of it. But it is harder to face all of it  on a personal level.
B000000H5K|5.0|this is some great motherfxcking music!  Ratamahatta is crazy as hell and I love it!  Buy this and Soulfly's debut album!
B000002NHN|5.0|Loreena has done it again. The range of this cd is good for anything from an intimate dinner to just a quiet &quot;me&quot; time. Her harmonies are magical, yet haunting. A &quot;must have&quot; for any taste.
B00000J8EK|5.0|I just got through listening to the entire album (where was &quot;Racing the Tide&quot;?) on the Chem Bros Webring.  It was all in real audio but it blew my mind just as easily.  Every track is distinctive and fresh.  Like  the other albums by the Brothers, as you listen you start to realize that  all other music is petty and unoriginal.  This album has a quality that  just sets it apart from the rest.  It perfectly represents the last 4  decades of music, yet it adds a wonderful 90's touch which serves as much  to glorify the past as it does to show off the future.  I truly feel sorry  for anyone who doesn't experience this album.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Written and directed by Michael Mann (Miami Vice, Last of the Mohican's, Thief) this is as good as it gets. With Pacino &amp; DeNiro on board how can you go wrong?  A phenomenal production in all categories with an  excellent script, great music, and breathtaking action, including a very  well done bank robbery sequence. They don't come any better than this!
B00000IOSU|5.0|Having been a huge fan of Sarah`s previous work, it`s hard to believe that it could get much better. But trust me when I say that this new album will touch you even deeper. Her hypnotic lyrics have helped me through some  rough times over the past couple years, and the live version of these same  songs are truly more memorable than ever before. This latest rendition of  &quot;Adia&quot; is by far my favorite of all her work. The album is  definately one of the best pieces of musical work I have ever had the  priviledge to listen too. 5 stars really doesn`t seem to do it justice!
B00000J7J4|4.0|I just saw Carlos live a few weeks ago, and didn't recognize a bunch of the songs, even though I liked them.  I was quite pleased to find them on this cool CD, especially &quot;(Da Le) Yaleo&quot; and &quot;Maria  Maria.&quot;  Any Santana fan will like this CD, and go see him live too.
B00000IOSU|1.0|dont get me wrong i like sarah i just dont like this cd. i mean where r all the songs from solace those are the real gems. also sarah has toured 4 times to support surfacing. 3 times at lilith fair and once on her own  tour. she needs to write some new material. however there is a great  version of ice cream on this cd.
B00000JCB2|5.0|how can people think limp bizkit is bad, theeyre the best thing ever in the rock world(apart from koRn and godsmack, and all that kick *** stuff) i won the cd through a special raffle, and there is only like 1 NOT good  song, but every album doesnt have perfect songs(311 comes close though.)  everyone, buy this cd, as i said, it it is goin 2 be the best ever.

068815333X|5.0|Wow!  This is another excellent book in an excellent series.  Lehane's writing is great; he deserves to be on bestseller lists.  I read it in less than 24 hours, which now leaves me in the unfortunate position of having to  wait another year for a new book by Lehane.
6304362498|5.0|This is the best screen adaptation of a book that I have ever seen.  John Hurt was marvelous as Winston and Richard Burton fabulous as O'Brien.  Both portrayed their characters masterfully.  Winston with his fear, paranoia,  and government mastered delusions.  O'Brien with his mastery and control of  everyone around him.<br />Drawing Winston into a conspiracy that he knew  nothing about only to later use that against him, the O'Brien character  masterfully subverts then terrorizes this man simply for the shear pleasure  of it.<br />Chilling portrayls by both actors.
B000002ULS|4.0|I like Belle and Sebastian. This album is great. I am not gay
B000002LGQ|2.0|The only song I liked on this CD was &quot;Like a Prayer.&quot; Madonna has a wonderful voice, but for some reason whenever I hear her music I think of her writhing around onstage and it ruins the whole thing for me.
B000002LK1|3.0|violator is good but overrated. dm have made better albums (i.e., some great reward, music for the masses, black celebration). there is not much going on on this cd. world in my eyes cheerlessly ambles along on a blippy  rhythm track. sweetest perfection plods along in the same kind of gloomy  dirge pace. personal jesus is a decent song but halo is pretty much filler.  waiting for the night is a pretty ballad but then the anemic musical  backing on most of these tracks is so minimal it makes violator seem like a  lazily arranged work in comparison to earlier albums (which were far more  dense in arrangement and musical complexity). (in its defense this album  does contain enjoy the silence which is their best ever song) the most  disturbing element with violator is its complete sense of stasis...depeche  mode pushed no new musical boundaries with this release and it just seems  like MTV-friendly modern rock for the kids while other DM albums were much  more full of substance. Not surprisingly, this album went double-platinum  in the States and became their best-selling album
0792151712|3.0|Titanic. Sigh. Had SUCH potential. Over-hyped movies can get SO annoying! The first time I saw it, I loved it, except I was mildly annoyed by Leonardo DiCaprio, whose acting was not so hot and who is, yes, glamorous,  however much too modern for the part.  Then, when everyone started  obsessing and hyperventilating over the whole thing..well, to sum it up in  one popular slogan:<br />&quot;The ship sunk. Get over it.&quot;
B000002KXO|5.0|This album is probably the best Mac album from the 80's.  Tango was good, but it was too weird.  This album, Mirage, has 4 songs on it I just listen to over and over again.  Love In Store, Hold Me, Gypsy, and Eyes Of The  World.  The song Oh Diane isn't too impressive, because it sounds like it  came out of the 50's or something.  All in all, a great album.
B000002AQQ|5.0|Sorry, the summary line cut me off. I really love this CD.  It's a compilation of some really great oldies. I listen to it at least once every 2 weeks, because it's like a great oldies music station without the ads!
0671027344|5.0|Im 16 and as a teenager growing up this book really let an insight into the world.  I recommend this book to every and anyone!
006017322X|5.0|I read quite alot, and in all my findings I have never found anything that matched the standards I set myself up to after To Kill a Mockingbird. Harper Lee was a writing genius. If you haven't read this book, buy it  right now! If you don't own this book, you should buy it right now! It  takes you on a tour of all your emotions, it sets you into making new  standards for living, and all in all it gave you good reading time. Hurry,  hurry, hurry! Every moment spent waiting to read this book is..well, not  wasted, but pretty darn close. one of the best books ever written.
B00000IQBN|5.0|A deeply fascinating, though not very comforting period drama, Barry Lyndon is an immensely detailed masterpiece that requires profound attention for all three hours it takes the story to unfold, but also proves  very rewarding and memorable at the end. There are many things in the movie  that look downright unpleasant and even disgusting. The aristocratic  hypocrisy under the mask of good manners, the weakness of character of many  key figures (including the protagonist himself) - all this hardly makes for  a movie which would be entertaining in a conventional sense. On the other  hand, the honesty with which Kubrick transforms this particular adventure  into a period piece of utmost importance is breathtaking, and the visual  style of the film earn it the merit of being one of the most gorgeous  movies ever made. Certainly not a movie to see as a substitute for the  latest romantic comedy that's out of stock, Barry Lyndon is, despite (and  maybe because of) this, one of the most wonderful cinematic experiences one  can imagine. A work like this one gives a good name to cinematography  itself.
B000000WCA|1.0|Unless &quot;zigaziga&quot; is another word for throw up, I am certainly not a spice girls fan. They have no musical talent whatsover-but I give them this, their music is upbeat and bouncy, good for a workout.
6303589162|4.0|Unlike the rather misfired experience with Dressed to Kill (which did, for some reason, please the crowds enormously), Brian De Palma's next thriller that involves risque themes is a clear parody of Hitchcock's and his own  previous movies. Sometimes it seems that the director intentionally makes  the audience see how derivative the film is, by hitting them over the head  with the presumed &quot;rip-offs.&quot; The only nostalgically sentimental  scene of the movie, which could be related to Phantom of the Paradise (the  main character's flashback about the dead heroine) stands alone amidst the  general tongue-and-cheek atmosphere that doesn't take itself very  seriously. The plot brilliantly combines philosophy and humor, and the  movie is a rather unforgettable experience overall. Some scenes are  osomewhat unpleasant to watch, but there are no unjustified allusions to  pornography or sleazy situations for their own sake. Overall, this is no  masterpiece, but a rather successful movie nevertheless.
B000002BE9|3.0|It's a good albumn, but not one of my favorites.  Criminal is my favorite song, but after you listen to the CD more then once it sounds like she's singing the same song with different words.
0790701251|5.0|It is no surprise that Full Metal Jacket has been hailed by many as the best was movie ever made. Rather than pulling a Casualties of War and following closely one isolated story within the wilderness of Vietnam, this  film ignores completely any logical development of the plot and focuses  instead on the portrayal of the war atrocities as they happened in real  life - often disconnected, often kaleidoscopic, but all leading to a  general feeling of usually very negative emotions. Overall, the film gives  a much more effective, emotionally involving picture of the horrors in  Vietnam than all other leaders of the genre, including masterpieces like  Apocalypse Now, Platoon, or Casualties of War. Kubrick's directorial style  is perfect, as usual, and added to A Clockwork Orange, 2001, Barry Lyndon  and Dr. Strangelove, this masterpiece firmly etsblishes him as one of the  greatest directors that ever lived. Although some of the characters  inevitably give their opinions of what's happening as they go, there are no  easy answers to be found anywhere. Even the final speech of Private Joker,  which should presumably leave the viewers with a ray of hope in their  hearts, goes hand-in-hand with a downright stupid, almost sadistically used  song about Mickey Mouse, not to mention a dark, intinidating landscape. The  military preparation which is depicted in the first part of the movie is  sufficiently disjointed from what's to come to even provide a broader  metaphor for all education and its sometimes distant connection to what  comes after it. The film is unlikely to leave anyone with an upbeat,  hopeful feeling, but it contains many components that ensure its place  among the greatest works of art of the last few decades.
6304994540|5.0|And you thought Raising Arizona required repeated viewings for the full effect.  I never get tired of this movie.  A classic in the same league as &quot;The Jerk&quot; and the aforementioned Coen Bros. flick.
B00000JFSL|5.0|I own a previously released Surfing...someone please review this one and compare it to the previous editions.  Thanks!
0440178002|4.0|This book is over 1200 pages long, but don't let the size intimidate you.  If any book makes reading an effortless exercise, it's this one.  The writing is sharp, tight, and exhilirating.  The action is relentless.<br />Of course, if you're looking for precise historical accuracy, look  elsewhere.  Some have criticized the limitations of Clavell's Japanese.  It  seems obvious that the book uses only a few words for limited effect; it's  not meant to be a primer in the language.<br />The greatest thing about this  novel is its presentation of action, romance, war, and all that good stuff.  It is also interesting to see Blackthorne move from hatred of the Japanese  towards an appreciation of their culture.  It's great when Blackthorne sees  his former comrades-in-arms near the end and feels mostly disdain for them.  Blackthorne seems to feel this disdain because they are not civilized and  sanitary in the Japanese sense.  The Europeans are definitely the  protagonists at the beginning; we can only sympathize when they are beset  by the tortures of Yabu.  But throughout the 1200 pages, Blackthorne learns  and changes.  It's a great journey to be on.
B0000025LS|4.0|this was one of my favorite albums when i was a teenager and first getting into classic rock.  the guitar and percussion work are fabulous, and you have a touch of pop music intertwined with the catchy &quot;winning.&quot;   this album is a great addition to any collection and would be the second  santana album i bought after greatest hits
6305003882|4.0|A depiction of the degredation and violence that can be associated with drug abuse can bring about, I thought this film was remarkable in its presentation of the anti drug message.  Compare this with what often seems  like the soft spoken  mildness of the &quot;just say no&quot;  approach.<br />For reasons that elude me, many often ranted and raved against  this movie.  After the dreadfully awful Colorado shootings, for example,  their seemed to be a desire to absolutely demolish the picture.
B00000J7I3|5.0|I haven't heard the extra tracks on the latest version, but I know from years back that this is a kick *** album and in my opinion Motley Crue's best by far.  This is their first album and it's raw which I like, but  along with that rawness is great songs, great rockn'roll attitude, and ball  bustin' guitar playing by Mick Mars.  This album is a must have for Crue  and metal fans.
068815333X|5.0|This is the thinking mans detective story.  The characters at first pass seem stereotypical, yet quickly flesh out into much more complex individuals.  Every time I thought I had the plot line doped out, it  shifted direction and ran away.   I thoroughly enjoyed this book and though  I quickly realized that the characters had history  it merely made me want  to read the prior books.
B000000W6R|5.0|The real test of any great rock album is how it sounds, 5, 10, or 30 years after its release.  It has been over five full years since this one was released.  After giving it a listen for the first time in over 2 years, I  have to say that this one is still great.  It has the same effect it had on  me back in 1994, so it must be a great album.  Possibly the best CD  released by the Pumpkins.
B00000IOSU|3.0|So, here we have the usual live album (translation: let's keep the fans occupied while I take another 4 years to make an album). This is not a classic by any means, but certainly not a bad effort. The fans will be  happy, and you never know; it may convert some new ones.<br />Some of the  songs (mostly the &quot;Surfacing&quot; material) sound like inferior  re-treads of the studio versions, without the atmosphere. But others songs  take on a new life in a live setting. &quot;Hold On&quot; soars yet again  (this is like the 4th or 5th different version of this song to be released;  all different &amp; all engaging). &quot;Fear&quot; scales to new heights  with a denser arraingement &amp; a great vocal. &quot;Fumbling Twords  Ecstacy&quot; is an emotional centerpeice with the band soaring during the  ending coda. And &quot;Possession&quot; just simply ROCKS (Sarah, the  alt-rocker...believe it).<br />One BIG critisim...the CD-ROM program included  isn't even worth looking at; it's a self-serving merchandising campaign.  Having put out 2 decent ROM programs before, I expected FAR better. That  and it's a pain to try &amp; play the music from your computer.<br />Given the  fact that it was 4 years between &quot;Fumbling..&quot; &amp;  &quot;Surfacing&quot;, and with her recent announcements that kids are now  on her agenda, it looks like it'll be quite awhile before we get a new  album (hell, it's been 7 years since either Peter Gabriel or Kate Bush have  released anything). This may tide some fans over, but it may only serve to  make them hunger for more. For what it is, it's not too bad.
0783226888|3.0|Compare this with the original 'The Day of the Jackal,&quot; and I think you'll see the former is a far better film than this one. This one did have exciting moments though and deserves a rental,  Gere and Willis are always  worth a look. Another bit of gratis advice  is always to get the DVD  version  of a film if possible.<br />I am getting impatient with critics who  seem to be ready to shoot from the hip and blast the remake of a  &quot;classic&quot; (Day of the Jackals qualifies here).<br />Look at them  without prejudice.  I think this applies to the 1998 Psycho too.
B00000JGHM|5.0|This is the movie that made me want to make movies!  An all-star cast with many stellar performances--Pacino and DeNiro sharing the screen simultaneously for the first time ever, plus a never cooler Val Kilmer, a  never better Tom Sizemore,and a never hotter Ashley Judd (not to mention a  pre Phantom Menace Natalie Portman)--Michael Mann's tour de force of the  L.A. Cops and Robbers scene catches all the stars at their best---and who  can forget the most intense shoot-out ever captured on film---filmed in  actual downtown L.A.---as a matter of fact, to guarantee the film's  authenticity, no soundstages were used!  These are all real locations.  If  you've never seen Heat, see what may be the most overlooked, underrated  film of the 90s.
B000003TA4|5.0|NEVERMIND WAS THE CULMINATION OF THE COBAIN CONUNDRUM.  THE BEST OF THE PUNKEST MADE HIS STATEMENT AND HE STARTED TWO OTHER METEORS ON THEIR ASSENT.

I JUST DISCOVERED THE DEPTH OF KURT  COBAIN THIS YEAR AND I LOVE HIM FOR GIVING US TWO STARTLING ARTISTS SO THAT  THE PHOENIX HAS REALLY RISEN FROM THE ASHES IN A DIRECT LINE. YOU SEE THE  PRODUCT THAT IS THE ALBUM CAME ABOUT AS THE CONFLUENCE OF DAVID AND  COURTNEY SHAPED THE WAY LIFE INSPIRED KURT TO HIS GREATEST CREATION AND I  LIKE TO THINK THAT HE DIED OF HAPPINESS WITH THIS FACT AND NOT OF DISPAIR  OF HIS REALITY OF EXISTENCE.  LITHIUM IS A DRUG THAT I HAVE TAKEN FOR  THIRTY-TWO YEARS AND I AM NOT NOW BECAUSE HIS  MEANINGFUL MUSIC  HAS  REPLACED THE DRUG AND LEFT PEACE.  I WISH THAT KURT COULD HAVE SHARED THAT  PEACE.

6305263248|4.0|I dont consider myself a great movie critic.. I never fill these things out .. I think in this case potential DVD buyers (DVD only) need a warning. If you use a DVD player for your tv set you shouldnt have a problem with  this. If you use a DVD-ROM drive for your PC you WILL encounter some very  annonying and pesky problems. 1. There is an included software DVD decoder  on the disc.. this is a great idea imho.. but the autoplay feature on this  is extremely slow and annoying. I advise you to DISable autoplay for your  drive. Every time you put this DVD in, or even hit play on your dvd  software, it launches the autorun.. It takes about 30 seconds just to bring  up one window with two buttons on it. It has even locked my system a few  times.. I advise you to NOT install the software it prompts you aobut even  if you do not have a dvd player. All the other features of the DVD are VERY  nice. I loved the feature-length commentary by the director (John  Frankenheimer), and the alternate ending was interesting as well (glad they  cut it out tho =P ). Let me say again this is a great movie.. just horrible  coding and lack of thought went into the software included on the DVD. (I  filled out the little customer response card that came with it.. and  attached a letter informing them of my disapproval of the aforementioned  things.. you should do the same) Sorry to take so long, enjoy the movie
B000000YBQ|5.0|Sleepy, perhaps.  Ethereal definitely.  Evans was the first to make the piano trio more than a lounge singer's backup, and remains one of the most admired (and imitated) jazz pianists of all time.  The only downside to  this CD is the recording, which is technically limited (one can imagine  Orrin Keepnews balancing the tape-deck on his lap as he recorded these  sessions).  Regardless of recording quality, a must-own if you enjoy jazz  from the late '50s and 60's.
B00000J8EK|5.0|This isn't block rockin' beats -it's better - taking what they know best while mixing it up with   Hope Sandoval on Asleep from Day, Bernard Sumner on Out Of Control - it totally flows. The whole album takes you somewhere  else, throws you in an acidic groove and leaves you there.
6305426651|5.0|The contrast between the first and second halves of this movie is striking.  An apparently romantic comedy suddenly takes a turn towards the horrors of war but with a positive attitude.  Of course the concentration  camp is not intended to be pictured realistically but to present to the  viewer a setting in which the spirit of the man triumphs, much like on a  stage rather than in a movie.  I was never so moved after seeing a film in  my life.  I was speechless.  Incidentally, I was not aware of the theme of  this movie when I went to see it and felt some of the &quot;what did I get  myself in for?&quot; as the story developed.  I recommend it highly for  anyone serioulsy interested in the cinema, comedy, and history.<br />Jerry A.  Neff, Ed. D.

0451452739|5.0|Arthur C. Clarke is considered a master of science-fiction by so many not because of finely crafted fictional worlds or highly detailed alternate universes...no, he is beloved and respected because his stories of fiction  take place in *our world*.  They are highly believable in a very real world  way, because (by and large) Mr. Clarke's stories are grounded in the  scientific reality of their day and laced with speculative science that is  feasible in every regard.  You believe in his worlds because they are of  our world.<br />Arthur C. Clarke does not craft characters with rich depth, or  twisting plots that are overly complex - he creates simply stories of  discovery that delight and astoud, *without* seeming overly unbelievable.

B00000J7JO|1.0|I have been a fan of the Chili Peppers for eight years, and this highly anticipated album was a HUGE letdown for me.  The energy and fun, carefree style that was apparent on such spectacular albums such as  Bloodsugarsexmagik and Mother's Milk have been exchanged for the same  droning and depressing crap that makes up the majority of modern music.  I  almost liked &quot;Around the World&quot; and &quot;Get on Top,&quot; but  for the most part, this new album is a total waste.  Some people say that  the Chili Peppers have grown up, but I say that they've SOLD OUT.  But then  again, who knows, they might just make up for this in a few years....

B000003S0P|5.0|So much could be said for this album in spite of these reviews and the many liner notes accompanying King Crimson box sets.  Not only is this an excellent album that represents all that is Crimson, it might also be the  last word that slammed the door shut on what was once the most maligned but  certainly most intriguing genre of rock music in its storied history -  progressive rock.  Even though the term made Robert Fripp cringe, King  Crimson was (from their lofty beginnings with &quot;In the Court of the  Crimson King&quot; to their harsh excursions through &quot;Larks ...&quot;  and &quot;Starless ...&quot; ) a progressive band, because hardly a single  song followed the verse/chorus/verse/chorus/guitar solo/chorus/fade-out  formula pervasive throughout what passes as popular music today.  Each  Crimson excursion explored beyond the boundaries most bands feared to  cross.  While some fared not as well (&quot;Formentera Lady&quot;), most  succeeded (esp. &quot;Larks Tongues in Aspic, Part II&quot;).<br />Red, once  thought to be the end of the band after the top of Robert Fripp's head blew  off (read said liner notes!), revealed a troubled mind (Fripp) in conflict  with the music business, his own muses and his ambitious bandmates John  Wetton and Bill Bruford.  Wetton's vocals developed with such conviction  and delivery - his bass fretwork fast and heavy (second to only Chris  Squire at the time); and lest anyone might still have been questioning  Bruford's startling decision to leave Yes at their peak, Bruford, with  drumming agile, intricate and heavy, emerged with such force and abandon  (to make up for the departed Jamie Muir) that John Bonham and Keith Moon  must have returned to the drawing board.  This against slabs of thick  metallic Frippian guitar helped define the &quot;Power Trio,&quot; a term  often applied to much more renowned bands like Rush, the Police, and Brand  X (each Crimson understudies).<br />The album kicks off with the title track,  adirge of heavy metal that revolves around the tritone (&quot;Diabolus in  Musica&quot; - once a forbidden interval in classical music - the devil in  music - more fodder for King Crimson mythology) twisting and turning in  various time signatures.  &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; is a ballad with a  beautifully lilting oboe counter-melody that falls into blistering,  revolving guitar arpeggios backed by an irreverent, blasting trumpet.   Wetton's most moving vocal performances in U.K. and Asia have this song to  thank for his craft of melody and restraint.  &quot;One More Red  Nightmare&quot; sears with brutal, thundering percussion and a faster  variation of the tritone that sends the piece into outer space behind Ian  McDonald's (a worthy welcome back from the first album) alto saxophone.   &quot;Providence&quot; is an unstructured jam that recalls King Crimson's  four-piece lineup with David Cross on violin.  While some jams on previous  albums come off as random and lost, &quot;Providence&quot; builds and  connects - until it disappears, probably due to tape error.   &quot;Starless&quot; concludes the album, and within the 12 minutes of this  aural masterpiece exist everything that is King Crimson - soft ballad  mellotron with linear guitar that *really* gently weeps; jam session with  all sorts of strange percussive blasts and crescendos of screaming guitar;  fast, jazzy jam session featuring Mel Collins on soprano sax and even  screamier guitar before every element falls into place at the end to repeat  the opening theme and conclude just this close to absolute madness and  despair.  Only in silence at the album's end does one find relief while  struggling to contemplate the meaning of what had just captivated his  senses for the last forty minutes.<br />Rock historians have noted that the  golden age of progressive rock came to an abrupt end with this album, for  as King Crimson ceased to exist (at the time), Genesis, Yes, ELP, Focus and  every other progressive band worth mentioning just never seemed quite the  same.  King Crimson's &quot;Red,&quot; an aural assault and a musical  journey into the depths of Fripp's mind, heart and soul, paints a picture  we might seldom wish to see in ourselves.  It is complicated, painful and  incredible and what's more - it demands the listener's attention,  intelligence and open mind.  Simply put it is the best album I have ever  heard.
6302000823|5.0|We have all loved the cinema and Cinema Paradiso exemplifies the true love and joy that movies bring to people's lives.  This is a touching movie about culture, community, dreams, and relationships.  If we could all dream  like Toto and love like Alfredo, then we would understand the opportunities  that await us.  <br />One learns that we are all tied to our pasts, our roots.   Those relationships make us who we are today and they never leave our  hearts.  This beautifully cast, directed, and shot movie reminds us that  there can and should be a time when we can all return home and find the  person who we once were, full of enthusiasm, joy, and wonder.

0375707972|2.0|...but it never did.  The big secret was a let down, and the characters were void, &quot;numb&quot; was the word the author used. This book is alright for those who have a good imagination and can fill in the emotions  and motives of the characters, but isn't that the writer's job?  To be  fair, there were a few pages in the book that should be read twice because  they are quite profound (and there is also a need to get something for your  time), but as a whole, the book may have lost itself in the translation.
B000002O1Q|4.0|Who is Fire Inc.?  They are awesome!!!  And who doesn't love Dan Hartman's &quot;I Can Dream About You?&quot;  This sountrack has doo wop, rock, bluesy type songs.  It's complete.  And the movie isn't bad either!
B00000J6AG|5.0|To be honest, what I heard of Moby i wasn't that crazy for, but bought this one on a whim, and it hasn't left the CD Player since.  The seamless integration of styles on this album is amazing, and this is a disc that any  music fan would appreciate--if you can't find the money, steal it, recycle  cans, anything, just get it! You won't be disapointed!
6305470448|5.0|Joseph&amp;Gwyneth had the best chemostry i've ever seen! It very much exceeded my expectations.It was a very fresh interpretation of Shakespeare and I hope to see a lot more of these wonderfull and talanted young actors!
B00000IOSU|5.0|I've been listening to Sarah for 5 or 6 years now.  As much as I love her studio version of the album &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot;, hearing her words and voice live is truly like having an out of body experience.   &quot;Mirrorball&quot; is a grand reflection of her gifts.  Sarah, if you  read this, thanks for creating such magic.  God was smiling when he (or  she) created you.
6304118406|1.0|There should have been a selection for ZERO stars as I give it no stars, period.  After watching half way I wanted to puke! I felt disgusted I regretted watching it.  Movies like these cause violence in today's  society, senseless and stupid violence.
B000005J56|5.0|The guy who is going on and on about political repression should get over it. This is about music, which is a prime example of how people deal with repression. This music has serious, American jazz influences. And at least  the guys were paid for it -
B00000IRED|5.0|To me this was the most original and incredibly scripted movie I've ever seen.  The use of a lot of camera angles was amazing.  I wished more movies were like the Truman Show.  It sure reminds me of &quot;1984&quot; and how  we could possibly be monitored 24/7 (NSA's Echelon, hint hint).  I don't  know why it costs a hundred bucks for the video and why can can only rent  it now?!  I sure can't wait for the video release.
B000003S5H|5.0|I just stumbled onto this CD and picked it out cuz it had a cool cover and i was bored of the usual german techno rubbish. The first time i heard moon safari i was immediately hooked. the first and 2nd tracks are awesome. if  you like Moby, Orbital, the Orb, Felix, get Air!!!!!!!
B000001EUL|5.0|It's almost hard to believe this LP turns 20 this year.  I grew up on the Scorpions' music, and this power-packed half-hour of music remains my all-time favorite album.  Every time I hear it, it sounds just as fresh.  A  new record contract, a new line-up, and having the Mad Axeman himself, MR.  Micheal Schenker, as a guest seemed to light a fire in these rising German  stars.  This is one of those rare moments where everything came together:  the writing, arranging, production, performance, lyrics, etc.  Such great  songs, including the legendary in-concert standard instrumental 'Coast To  Coast'.  To hear a great outtake from the sessions of this LP, check out  'Hey You' on Best Of Rockers 'N Ballads.  For the unitiated, begin your  Scorpions collection here.
6305297525|3.0|Okay now 90 bucks for a video!  Maybe if it was one of a kind and I collected it!  Please drop those enormous prices!  Must see the movie!  Rent it!
6304167660|5.0|A fantastic comedy. Wonderfully written and performed even better
6305365121|1.0|A tired story seen before in other sci-fi stuff like outer limits and twilight zone.  Machines make mistakes; people are suspcious of the machine; want to get back to nature, but machine is providing the comfort  of the good life.  Machine falls, people awaken.... blah blah blah.  I  agree with the other reviewer - the Final Frontier was better and I hated  that one.  Bring on the big screen battle scenes, the Enterprise and  running and jumping - yeah that's the trek I love.  Skip this tape and see  the Phantom Menace - that's got probs too but at least we have your  gratuitous battle scenes and big box battleships.
0440224764|2.0|Like all Grisham books, this one has a good start but ends quite badly. Everything is too pat as one other reviewer wrote, &quot;like a made for movie book&quot; Try reading Leon Uris.
B000002GVO|5.0|They came to my city during the &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot; tour -- the greatest concert I've ever seen. They opened with &quot;Hotel California&quot; in the old form (not that wimpy &quot;Hell&quot; version).  It was incredible! Thinking about seeing/hearing Felder and Walsh duel  through that song brings tears to my eyes. This CD has everything!
1558807381|4.0|This film, while lacking in that all too scapegoated realm of character development, is both enjoyable and inspirational.  &quot;Lengend&quot; is a fairy tale, a fantasy full of elves and unicorns, demons and ghouls.  It  never claims to be anything more and doesn't need to be anything more, it  is mythical movie and follows a mythical format.  Nevertheless, this film  is a wonder to behold.  &quot;Legend&quot; is both spectacularly visual and  carries very potent and valuable lessons of bravery, love, and the evils of  hate.  It is a pity there are so few films made these days that take us on  a fairy tale journey through times and ages when innocence still frollocked  in the forest and brave people risked their lives for the sake of love.   I  recommend this film to all those seeking a trip back to their youth, back  to simpler times. You won't be dissapointed.
B000002H97|1.0|I bought this cd because of all the hype surrounding Metallica but I guess everyone has really bad taste because &quot;Metallica just sucks!&quot; There's nothing special about these guys.  The music was so slow and plain  sounding.  I think thrash fans should try out the real thrash gods  Megadeth.
B00000IOSU|5.0|I almost didn't get it since I have all of the rest of her CD's but couldn't resist &amp; am glad I didn't!  The live version(s) make me think of the lives shows I've seen.  I guess you can never have enough Sarah!
0679805273|5.0|I had just quit my job and moved to a new city when I came across &quot;Oh the Places You'll Go!&quot; Though the move was a great adventure with a happy ending, at the time my roommate and I were scraping by while we  looked for new jobs, and life was stressful. The book was just the kind of  pep talk I needed then ... in the years since, I've given it to friends my  age and even to my 4-year-old nephew so he'll have it when he's old enough  to need a good pep talk!
6305126062|5.0|This is a wonderful movie for adolescents.  As a high school English teacher, my colleague and I develped an entire literature unit around &quot;Horse Whisperer.&quot;  From the moment of the horrifying accident  scene, the kids are hooked on this film and willingly discuss a myriad of  issues relating to it.  Plot, characterization, conflict, setting, theme,  irony, etc. all lend themselves well to &quot;The Horse Whisperer,&quot;  not to mention the personal issues of career vs. parenting, grief, healing  marital fidelity, and so forth.  My students love this movie!
0440228921|5.0|In lang. Arts i got a e my first semester but i got a 85% (B)in the second semester, because it was all about the giver! Most of my class did not even really read the book, but I did! It was amazing, it held my attention from  page to page and from chapter to chapter. It is a shame that some of my  peers did not bother to read this intestering book, I think it is a  MASTERPIECE!  As you can tell it is a very good book. I enjoyed reading it  very much. Lois Lowry is amazing.  Keep making great stories.
B000003BF1|5.0|Love it, love it, love it. The earthy, sloppy grittiness of the Stones from this period exhilirates me, makes me feel real... dirty. Yeah. &quot;Live with Me&quot; is so nasty and untamed... You can hear the  desperation and decadence in &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; and the wise-ass  attitude in &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; (a great parody of &quot;Let It  Be&quot;). Keith's &quot;You Got the Silver&quot; is disarmingly beautiful  and soulful--&quot;Feelin' foolish, yeah that's for sure, waitin' here by  your kitchen door.&quot; What a great image--not the front door, or the  bedroom door, but the kitchen door! And the swaggering, truly frightening  &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot; is propelled by an unsettling current of  sexual violence. &quot;Well ya heard about the Boston--!!!... He's movin'  like a sly black panther.&quot; But rock'n'roll is great because it IS  scary, it should be, anyway, it should come from the gut and the spine and  the crotch, and that's all. This is a magnificent album, I'm glad after all  these years it retains all its power and threat.
0671798154|5.0|I recommed that you study A bit on the end of world war 2  before you read this interesting novel
B000001Y2U|4.0|Aside from the fact that Manson is visually repulsive, and his messages are taken to heart by millions of angst ridden adolescents the album is great. I have always been a fan of heavy music, and heavy this is. For  those of you that scoff at Manson, this ablum stands up on it's own. I am  sure that much of the credit is due Reznor, but nonetheless it's a great  listen.
B000002UA0|5.0|This is one of my all-time records (together with &quot;Madcap Laughs&quot;, &quot;Unicorn&quot; (Tyrannosaurus Rex), &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; (Bowie) and Soft Machine's first album). Everyone  knows that Syd is a genius, and I don't need to repeat it ad nauseum (if  somebody doesn't know, this is the chance to discover!). There's no bad  song (not even mediocre) in this album. All of them are gems of  psychedelia. My favourites are &quot;Astronomy Domin&quot;, &quot;Lucifer  Sam&quot; and &quot;Bike&quot;. But I don't agree when people say that  &quot;Madcap...&quot; is worser than this. Both are masterpieces!!!
B00000J7JO|5.0|this chilli peppers album is by far better than 1 hot minute which was there worst album the best songs on here are around the world scar tissue and Emit Remus. This is there best album yet were I live at least it has  got no radio airplay LONG live the mighty rock 103.5 Chicago
6300181456|5.0|Zany comedy that features the best talents of Julie Andrews, Mary Tyler Moore and Carol Channing.
0790701251|5.0|The thing I love about this movie is its originality....usually, the soldiers in combat films are nothing but pure actors thrown into battle fatigues, given a gun and told to act. Full Metal Jacket is different...we  endure the recruits' pain and suffering through Parris Island boot camp,  and live with them during the grisly war....and that's why FULL METAL  JACKET brings you close to the real thing.<br />But anyway, on to the  storyline and so forth. The plot involves a young Marine recruit, Private  Joker, who gets through Marine Bootcamp by excelling in everything  possible. He is then thrust into Vietnam as a journalist....and it is in  Vietnam that he always complains he &quot;never sees enough action.&quot;  Well, the &quot;action&quot; comes to him, but he soon discovers it is not  all fun and games.<br />Though Modine's narrative can be a bit flat and  one-sided at times, the acting in this film is absolutely superb. Also, I  have noticed in war films that the U.S. Marine Corps always seems to be  left out. Well, FULL METAL JACKET almost glorifies the Marine Corps, and  you don't see too many movies that give the USMC a lick of respect (that  they completely deserve). <br />I should also comment on the military  accuratness of this film....all the moves are right, no one ever seems to  be out of step in marching formations, and, according to my father, a  Vietnam-Era Marine Corps veteran, the harshness of bootcamp....and  especially the portrayal of the Drill Instructor, is exactly how it was  (is). <br />Another great thing about FMJ is its dark tones, that last from  beginning to end. The deaths in this film are very graphic, and Stanley  Kubrick puts you in a hell (making you feel as if you were there) that you  want to leave right away and escape the horrors of war. That's what makes  FMJ a very powerful movie. A nice touch was the eerie ending, and the  classic Rolling Stones song at the end (the name escapes me).<br />The only  thing unrealistic aboutthis movie is that Private Lawrence  &quot;Pyle&quot; never lost any weight, in fact, he looked as if he gained  a few pounds. Any Marine will tell you that the &quot;fat kid&quot; in  their boot camp platoon left basic training a fit, ready-to-kill war  machine...I guess Pyle's lack of weight loss goes to show us that the  catering provided by FMJ's producers was very good!<br />All in all, though, a  graphic and moving film that leaves you a bit shocked and a LOT  entertained...it should be in everyone's collection.
B000006045|5.0|I bought this album based mainly on Teardrop &amp; Dissolved Girl. I love them, and I have grown to love the others. I especially love Inertia Creeps. It's all so good...
B000006NPY|5.0|With all the boy bands etc. going on in MTV land the pumpkins decided to try something different, and who can blame them. The first few listens you probably wont like it, but if you digest it and play it a couple times  you'll realize how great an album this is. Tear, Pug, and For Martha are a  few of my faves. So give it a chance. Jimmy their drummer's back so they're  back to their rocking ways so watch out for their next album.
B00000IQMT|5.0|I bought the CD before seeing the film, so much of the music was familiar and I could &quot;see&quot; how John Williams employed it.  Mr. Williams is a master at composing film music (and other concert works) and if it sounds  like some of his other music it must be remembered that composers have a  voice when they write music that is much like our speaking voices. If some  reviewers were disappointed it seems to me it is because they do not  understand this.<br />The music is far from disappointing.  That the  arrangement of tracks does not follow the movie is less important than the  flow of themes and ideas.  A lot of thought was put into what Mr. Williams  wrote and the result is both familiar and fresh.
B000000WJZ|5.0|A masterpiece, buy it now
B00000J7RZ|5.0|Jenifer's CD &quot;On the 6&quot; is very good. After hearing her music on VH1 and MTV,  I'm ready to buy it
6304457383|5.0|saw it when i was a kid. terrified me. a classic in suspense. alan arkins role in this movie was excellent. should have won an oscar for it. they don't make them like that any more.
B00000IOSU|5.0|Sarah is a Goddess and her music is extremely heavenly.  Buy this CD.  You won't be disappointed if you are a Sarah fan (or even if you aren't!)
B00000IOSU|5.0|A Sarah fan for many years (before the mainstream discovered her), I have found this to be the quintessential Sarah CD--a must have for any fan. Unlike many live albums, the music is not lost to fan noise, and if  possible, Sarah sounds better than ever live. A wonderful addition to any  music collection!
6304078102|5.0|This movie was great! It was nice how it showed scenes of the psassing of time. I loved It. I usually like action or science fiction movies but this movie was one of the all time greatest movies ever made!
6304675348|5.0|I liked this movie so much and really loved Neve Campbell in it.  She may not be a teenager, but she portrays one so well and is the ideal survivor.
630514415X|3.0|this was a good movie but the nudity and  swearing was unnescesar
B0000025RI|5.0|This masterpiece will also will be the greatest album of all time.  No one could have done it better.  The King Of Pop has one that will stand the test of time.  Rating:A+
B000002HMH|1.0|Am I the only one who thinks these guys are gay? Is that their new target audience? Wearing makeup has a different meaning in the 90's than it did in the 80's. This is not some 'inspirational' turn in their career, it is the  sound of old guys who need to give up or at least change the name of the  band. I hate it when bands (and shows) get run into the ground. It's better  to die with pride and just stop making albums. I feel sorry for Cliff, he  must be in Hell.
B000002LHX|5.0|This is an excellent masterpiece done by Prince. One that I would recommend that everyone must have. rating: A+
B000001FMX|5.0|Probably the best tribute to a team of heroes. These are the people who created the kindling wood for the fire of punk rock. The first of an era who kicked the Eagles, Bob Seeger, and Andy Williams off the cliff face. If  the Ramones and Blondie were born from the New York Dolls, and the  Heartbreakers came from their death (we do not mean Tom Petty!), then they  are saints..
B00000J7A2|5.0|I've always loved this record and MAN does it sound fantastic on this reissue. The evil blues growl of Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band must've been *daunting* listening back in 1967, but in in the eclectic  musical climate of 1999 it sounds, well, \\"contemporary.\\" Isn't it  about time that the good Captain got his due? Well thanks to this, the  upcoming \\"Grow Fins\\" box set and Rhino's \\"best of\\" just  around the bend, finally Van Vliet's music will be heard by more than just  a few music afficiandos with very fine taste. Kudos to John Platt for this  FINE and long overdue rehauling of \\"Safe as Milk.\\" Trust ME, it's  great!!!!! OH, I forgot to mention that between this and the reissued  \\"Mirror Man\\" you get all the \\"lost\\" tracks from the MM  session. Get 'em both,people, get 'em both!
B00000J7J4|3.0|There are only about 2 songs on this album that I don't like.  I am a huge fan of instrumental Santana, and there is some of that here.  I think all of the guest singers kind of breaks the momentum because the styles jump  back and forth with no flow.  To truly experience Santana, see him in  concert, without all of the singing.  Carlos, the Matchbox 20 singer, what  were you thinking?
B00000J7J4|1.0|There have been five reviews already on this and if you look at the dates on the first three, they posted their comments before the CD had even been released. I'm buying this for my wife today. I base my decision on the last  two reviews, since those folks have listened to the CD. But, c'mon, folks.  Don't post a review if you haven't heard the CD!
0780623134|5.0|Check out IMDB.com and you'll see this movie at number 1 in the all time favourites. It's been number 1 on that site for at least 2 years Why ? A brilliant, thought provoking movie that will be sure to move you and  hopefully change the way you see life
B00000AFHM|5.0|I am embarrased that I have not heard of B&amp;S until recently.  I agree with Amazon's review where they describe the music of B&amp;S as &quot;complex arrangements favor a whimsical diversity&quot;  Buy this CD  today and spare yourself future embarrasment.
B00000IOSU|5.0|I bought Mirrorball yesterday and listened to at least 10 times.  This is Sarah at her absolute best.  Anyone that says otherwise is not a true Sarah fan.  There is so much feeling beside every song on the CD. It is so  powerful!
6305161879|1.0|This movie was so over-hyped when it was released.  Honestly, what is so funny about it?  Kline comes across as a bad actor, Cleese and his script are out of it, and Curtis is just annoying.<br />I guess we Americans have a  very low bar when it comes to labeling comedies &quot;great.&quot;
0684800713|2.0|This book had absolutely no message.  At best it was a decent-flowing autobiographical narrative of a buch of meaningless stuff that happened one summer.  There is some symbolism, but no message to give it any meaning.   It left me wondering what all the praise could possibly be about.  It also  left me completely dissapointed.
B000001DQI|5.0|Hmmm...lets see, I have owned this recording in every format imaginable, including 3 of the CD versions (MCA's original double disc from 1984, MFSL's Gold Disc from 1989 and the &quot;Classic Years&quot; version).   Wore out numerous albums and tapes before the CD's came along.  Does that  tell you how much I love this album???  I am sure when a new format comes  out I will buy this release once again!!!!!!  To say that this is a great  album is a total understatement.  I have been through cars, homes, jobs,  marriages, etc, but my copy of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road will always be  there for me!!!  Had this CD been released today instead of 1973, there  would have been at least 10 singles released from this!  About once a month  or so I listen to this one all the way through, and 26 years later  &quot;Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding&quot; still gives me  goosebumps!!!
6302787564|5.0|There is so much to say about this movie. It's premis is simple, Nerdy, but normal guy gets fed up with the way things are. Bill Foster (Douglas)erupts in violence at everyday annoyances. You find yourself  cheering for Douglas and laughing at the demise of his enemies. You even  cheer when Douglas is beaten because he gets the last laugh
B00000IOSU|5.0|I'm not a fan of &quot;live&quot; recordings, since they often don't capture the full studio sound experience, and I also                      typically don't like the audience noise from live recordings. But this  recording transcends my objections! Sarah's                      voice is  an absolute gift, and her &quot;live&quot; renditions of familiar songs are  a revelation. The recording quality is                      excellent and  the audience noise does not overwhelm. You'll want to have this CD in your  collection. It's                      already a favorite of mine.
6305232660|1.0|From the very beginning this movie was awful. The story line is very weak. The directore attempts to build tension by showing how the blow the comet. What took armageddon over an hour to do they compressed into six minutes  tops. Then they shift to who's going to die and who will live when the  comet will hit. The graphics are pretty good for when one piece hits. I  especially love watching people attempting to outrun a wave moving at 1100  mph. Pure junk through and through. Rent but don't ever buy
B00000G3PA|5.0|All you people that complain about movies need to remember that they are merely a form of entertainment.  It's worthless to complain about how unrealistic a movie is when it is a work of fiction that is put together to  give you something to do for 2 hours.
B00000J7S8|5.0|I was lucky enough to find a promotional copy of &quot;When I Look in Your Eyes&quot; at work recently. It ended up on the &quot;Giveaway&quot; table! What a treasure! I picked up one of DK's CD's last year, and couldn't get  over my good luck. The combination of her style and voice just smoulder. As  much as I love my other CD, this one has become the new standard. Kudos to  Diana for expanding her range, and adding the strings. I think it adds a  tremendous depth and smoke to her sound that I really adore. &quot;I'll  String You Along&quot; is without a doubt the standout song here. Buy this  CD ASAP!
B000002UUX|5.0|This is the release which saved the world from Poison, Skid Row, Bon Jovi, etc. and put thrashers back in the driver's seat.
B000002KCC|5.0|Neil is flat-out a great artist and this album is reflective of him at his artistic peak.  I am not saying this is his only peak, just one of his greatest.  Long May Neil Run!
B000000OAN|4.0|A Night at the Opera is good, but definitely isn't great.Basically because of the lack of great songs on the album.Now with good but not great songs like the overrated &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; and a ambundance of just  mediocre songs like &quot;Sweet lady&quot; and &quot;'39&quot; just doesn't  let &quot;ANATO&quot; fall in to the great catagory the really only great  song on &quot;ANATO&quot; is the much underrated &quot;the Prophets  song&quot;.Bottom line a couple of good songs isn't enough to carry an  album into greatness.
6305426651|5.0|Benigni's got it all: funny the most part of the movie, serious when he needs to be... I'm sorry for mister Hanks, one of my favourite actors of the &quot;new generation&quot;, but Benigni simply deserved the Oscar...  and when you think at the fact that he's the first not english speaking  actor to win the Oscar, you can't argue at the idea that he achieved  something brilliant. Bravo Roberto!
6305076650|3.0|I must admit to being a devoted Rocky fan...spending much of my college years living at the midnight showings. I was thrilled when i heard this was headed for video...only to be grandly disappointed when the magic, supplied  by audience participation, wasn't there. If you are a die-hard Rocky  fan...you will probably want this...if you're new to the film...don't  bother...look for a midnight show somewhere
B000002HAJ|4.0|several standout wonderful songs; trust, friday i'm in love, a letter to elise. others seem to blend into one long, brooding, yet compleetly enjoyable album best played on a grey wet day.
6300271439|3.0|if you want a semi-mindless, screwball comedy that will almost make you wet yourself laughing...then this is the film for you. Madonna and Dunne are a great combo. Don't look for any meaningful, socially-redeeming value  in this one...just sit back and laugh
6304504012|5.0|I enjoy this film more every time I see it. There is just so much to it. Madonna got shortchanged in the awards department. Antonio was perfectly cast as Che. Lets hope he is offered more roles that showcase his singing  talent.
B00000DFMM|4.0|I only give four stars for one reason: There is a Japanese edition of &quot;A Secret Wish&quot; that includes more and different tracks. Especially &quot;Dream Within A Dream&quot; is more ambient, beginning much  more smoothly with a solo trumpet floating into the song before the bass.  Look out for that import! In addition you will get as bonus tracks the  exented versions of &quot;Dr. Mabuse&quot;, &quot;P-Machinery&quot; and  &quot;Duel&quot; and Propaganda's really cool cover of &quot;Femme  Fatale&quot;. I found that edition already owning the regular one - and  it's worth to have both.
6304414048|5.0|I've seen this Movie and the truth is it  made me cry to see how two very different persons could come together and be able to love each other as much as Ben(Nicholas Cage) and Sera(Elizabeth Shue) did.
6302508878|4.0|My critique is based on the 3-minute difference between the original theatrical release (c1933-34) and the sanitized/PC version.  What has been post-production cut is a dialogue below decks between Armstrong &amp; Wray  wherein she uses the phrase, &quot;I'm free, white, and twenty-one.&quot;   It is curious that that is 'blipped' but they leave in the phrase several  scenes later, &quot;Yeah, blondes are a little scarce around here.&quot;   Still, this endures as both classic and relevant entertainment.
0790734060|2.0|As a work of fiction, this movie was acceptable.  Yet, it is the reason that many people think Mozart was a childish pervert.  He wasn't.  He actually was very intellegent and capable of upholding the strict standards  of decorum of 18th century Vienna.  Shaffer has created a fictional Mozart,  and that has greatly influenced the way society pictures the true Mozart.   If one wishes to see a mediocre example of film-making, watch this movie.   If one wishes to see how Mozart really was. . . just listen to his music.
B000001ESP|5.0|Rush hit their peak with Moving Pictures, and they never went back down from there.  Best album!
0679805273|5.0|I use this book as a theme for sixth graders preparing to go to junior high.  It is a great book for all ages!!!
1573300403|5.0|I enjoyed the fact that I was able to see the MTV performance. The Earth song video is the best video I have ever seen.
B00000BKDS|5.0|First off, I don't actually have this album, but I do have all the songs except Charlotte the Harlot and Strange World on A Real Live Dead One and Live After Death. Having listened to clips from the songs by Di'Anno I must  say that it is nothing short of spectacular. Phantom Of The Opera is  wicked.
0684867621|4.0|As an avid reader of King I feel this book was an amalgam of his talents as a involving story teller and as a suspensefull writer. I enjoyed this book because it was so much like somthing that you would read in the  headlines...Little girl lost. What King does however is describe the whole  story and the undeniable force of survival that exists in all of us. great  read.
0590353403|5.0|Harry Potter is one of the most wonderful books I have ever read.  I couldn't put it down for a second.  It had a wonderful blend of character's, action, and humor.  It never got boring.  If you read this  book I am sure you will enjoy it very much.  It is for all ages to read and  enjoy over and over again.  If you liked this book I recommend that you  read the second one, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secret's which is also  a great book

0590353403|5.0|An adventurous Harry Potter has no idea about his past or his parents, because when he was little....  There was a horrible accident.    Harry survived it, but had a lightning bolt scar.    This is a vivid, detailed  book that is well played.    It's amount of characters is just enough to  confuse you a bit.    Bunches at a time.   Some good.    Some bad.    Our  fifth grade teacher read it to her class.    So I got interested and I  started to read it.    I read it in a day.    I'm reading the second one  now.  Can't wait for the other five to come out.    This wild goose chase  of a book is a keeper!!!!!!!!!!    So you should read: Harry Potter and the  Sorcerer's Stone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2070364232|4.0|I was introduced to the Petit Nicolas stories in high school and I love them. They're very funny as well as surprisingly intelligent and it has a sweetness that isn't too saccharine. The french is simple enough for  beginners. The stories are intended for children but adults who snub Petit  Nicolas simply because it is children's literature are missing a lot.
0792153189|1.0|This movie bites, and is one of the most over-hyped, yet thoroughly dissapointing, films I've ever seen.  This is the first egg ever laid by Morgan Freeman to my knowledge, whose movies are generally outstanding.   While his performance is good, there's not much else to see - every cool  special effect in the entire movie was shown in the pre-release  commercials!  If this movie had featured ten more minutes of special  effects (that's what saved Armageddon) and ten less minutes of mindless  character development of lame characters I didn't care about, it might have  worked.  Instead, I left the theater thinking &quot;That's it?&quot; and  wanting a refund.    Because I disliked this movie so much, I did not go  see Armageddon in the theater, which I regret.  I definitely made the wrong  call.  Watching Deep Impact is like watching ice melt.  Yuck.
B000002UAF|5.0|What can I say that others haven't? If you want to get a flavor of Beatlemania, this CD should definitely be in your collection.  To this day, I still enjoy all the tracks and rank this as one of my favorite Beatles  album.   As for the instrumental versions: You're all referring to UA's  release, not Capitol's, right?  (The film was released under United Artists  giving them rights to all the songs from the movie) Anyhow, I felt cheated  when I had this on vinyl.  In fact I bought the import so I could hear all  the songs meant for the album.  Oh well, horses for courses!
014028009X|2.0|I thought that Fielding gave pathetic view of a woman's life after thirty.  It was very depressing how Bridget was obsessed with her love interest, Daniel, and how he completely blew her off. It appeared as though nothing  in Bridget's life was going right until the end.  Overall, the book seemed  unrealistic and full of Bridget whining about how pathetic her life was.
0380973464|5.0|Neil Stephenson brilliantly spins three plots simultaneously into one fantastic adventure.  He draws heavily upon WWII History, cryptoanalysis, and today's high tech industries combined with a lot of romance to set the  stage for the treasure hunt of all time.  This adventure will leave you  feeling good and wanting more.
B00000IOSU|5.0|I sat and listened to this CD twice and was blown away by the musicianship and vocal ability of this woman. I have listened to her CDs for years now, but the freshness and haunting harmonies in these songs is breathtaking.  This is a can't lose purchase. Lisa Souza

6305252521|4.0|&quot;The Truman Show&quot; should have been the best film of the 1990's.  This is a rare instance where added an hour to the film would have helped it out.  Let's face it, Truman is just not that interesting.  If we would  have found out more about the other &quot;actors&quot; in Truman's world,  and how they dealt with their fame, that might have added some tension to  the story.  Another sad fact, Jim Carrey's performance was nothing  noteworthy.  Anybody could have played Truman, while nobody but Carrey  could have played Lloyd Christmas (&quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;).  But the  positives of the film include the strange world presented here  (particularly the homage to &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; near  the end), and the high concept of the film.  The ending is great!   &quot;The Truman Show,&quot; while a good film with an existentialist  ending (where Truman is free to explore the world and become for himself  what he now wants to become), ultimately comes up a little short.
B000002KIQ|5.0|Everybody knows how talented Ry Cooder is.....but this album is must have if only for Tia Juana/The Pearls alone. Very pretty, off-beat and obscure renditions of songs you wouldn't otherwise get to hear. I would love to  have a transcription to &quot;Flashes&quot; for guitar. I think that it was  a Bix Beiderbecke tune. Maybe you'll never buy a Bix Beidrbecke recording  but after listening to Ry Cooder you will have to ask yourself &quot;Why  not? Definitly enjoyable! Earl &quot;Fatha&quot; Hines ia also on the  recording...Didn't he play with Louis Armstrong?
0517122707|5.0|Truly, the single funniest book I have ever read...a close second to &quot;Auntie Mame&quot; in the sweepstakes for funniest American novel of the 20th Century.  Years after reading this book, when I finally got to New  Orleans, I already KNEW that wonderful, wacky city.  I knew it in my soul,  thanks to John Kennedy Toole.  It scares me when people do not find this  book funny...what has life done to them?  Chilling.  The sheer brilliance  of this book makes me invoke that much over-used word:  Masterpiece!  Pure  and simple genius. You'll laugh, you'll cry.  You'll learn about life!
6305265488|5.0|wonderful movie. Ms.Barrymore is a very tallented actress and has improved over the last decade. The movie was great, and I don't see why it was rated PG-13. If you only buy one movie this year, make it Ever After. It was  truly wonderful. I hope there is another one like it soon
B00000IOSU|5.0|I got on the McLachlan bandwagon in 1988 with &quot;Touch&quot; and haven't look back.  Beyond a shadow of a doubt, she is the best female rock artist of her generation.  This is her long-overdue live album, so the  world can hear how that sublime, velvety, powerful and evocative voice  sounds live. Compare her live sound to that of other female artists (such  as Jewel, Sheryl Crow) and they fade into insignificance.  A must-have CD  for any music lover that contains the best version of &quot;Hold On&quot;  available on CD and a breathtaking version of the show-stopping  &quot;Fear.&quot;  Truly outstanding.
B00000IPHA|1.0|I saw this movie recently and was surprised at how completely unwatchable it was. Robert Redford and Paul Newman mug their way through the action from start to finish, looking much more like self-conscious movie stars  than train robbers or gun-slingers of the old west.<br />&quot;Butch and  Sundance&quot; is not completely without interest to the casual observer of  American cultural sensibilities, however. The most significant moment in  the film by far is the scene where Paul rides his bicycle around a  barnyard, flashing his legendary grin for all the world to see. As the  dream-like Katherine Ross gazes at him adoringly, we hear B.J. Thomas sing  Burt Bacharach's &quot;Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head.&quot;  As I  watched this taking place, I realized that I was witnessing the birth of  the 1970s.<br />In spite of such curiosities, &quot;Butch Cassidy and The  Sundance Kid&quot; is quite simply one of the most overrated Hollywood  films of all time. If you want to see an excellent film from that era about  &quot;the old west,&quot; I would suggest you get a copy of Robert Altman's  &quot;McCabe and Mrs. Miller.&quot;

6305234760|5.0|This opera is one of the great masterpieces by Puccini.  I am certain that no greater setting could have been used for this opera, and here we have it on video.  I am a bit of an Opera &quot;junkie&quot; and I find this to be  a wonderous performance and recording of the opera.
B000001ED1|4.0|Although I am on the precarious side of really appreciating &quot;One of Us&quot; for it's dingyville banal what-if-attitude, I have to say that the rest of the album is the voice of a totally different artist. A more  soulful, clever one. I bought the album for songs like &quot;St. T...&quot;  &amp; &quot;Spiderweb&quot; in which she layers and complicates and tinkers  about. Somehow, it's never gratuitious and darned it if I don't think she's  worth the $14.99 at the store or a free BMG intro extravaganza. Buy this  album.
B000002G87|5.0|I am not even an Eric Clapton fan, but this album is amazing.  This is great &quot;blues-rock&quot; and anyone who is looking for a great addition to their collection should pick this one up.  The album is solid all the  way through, and you won't be able to stop listening to it.
0064471837|5.0|I can honestly say that Sabriel is the best book I have ever read! I couldn't put it down, so I read for four hours straight! I encourage Garth Nix to write a sequel, or even make a trilogy with Sabriel as the first in  the set of three books. A MUST READ!
B00000J7RZ|2.0|On screen, Jennifer Lopez is an engaging, sexy and sensual actress with a charm, passion and beauty that bleeds Latin fire.  On disc, Jennifer Lopez is a competent singer fronting songs that could barely ignite a pilot  light.  Jennifer might never reach the vocal heights of today's R&amp;B  divas (think Houston or Braxton) - give her an A for effort; but the lyrics  - hardly C material in a remedial poetry class - taint an already drab  collection of mostly banal R&amp;B pop.  &quot;If You Had My Love&quot;  hits the ground running, and &quot;Should've Never&quot; is a dreamy,  erotic ballad, but most of what's left stumbles into a rut.  &quot;No Me  Ames&quot; works best as a ballad; as a salsa version, it feels out of  place - imagine Gloria Estefan sharing a CD with SWV.  &quot;Feelin' So  Good&quot; and &quot;Too Late&quot; sound like hip-hop wannabes with about  as much street-tough moxie as Brandy.  &quot;Promise Me You'll Try&quot;  and &quot;Talk About Us&quot; are forgettable ballads.  Though sung with  sensual honesty, musically they're dead on arrival.  Saving the set are  &quot;Open Off My Love&quot; and &quot;Let's Get Loud&quot; - both a blend  of hip-hop and Latin where Jennifer soars and excels with a sense of  enthusiasm and discovery - and &quot;Una Noche Mas&quot;, groovy Latin  house (better in Spanish than its &quot;Waiting For Tonight&quot;  counterpart).  Jennifer is bursting with potential, but we will have to  wait for her second release to see if she can fulfill it because &quot;On  the 6&quot; has become the inevitable hit, and it will probably have enough  chart success to sustain it for months.  Add to that her acting career, and  that can take years.  <br />If Jennifer could have waited another year and  scrapped about six (irony?) of the duds and replaced them with four other  different songs (in the style of &quot;If You Had ...&quot;, &quot;Open Off  ... &quot; and &quot;Should've ... &quot;), &quot;On the 6&quot; could very  well have stood as a testament to the sultry, sexy and spicy persona with  whom we've fallen in love in &quot;Selena&quot; (the movie) and &quot;Out  of Sight.&quot;  After all, Jennifer is a wealthy celebrity.  What a shame  she couldn't use some her clout to kick some of these insipid songwriters  to the curb and inspire her equally wealthy producer, Sean  &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs, to find some better songs.  You want pop, Latin  and R&amp;B?  Put &quot;On the 6&quot; back on the shelf, and buy Selena,  &quot;Dreaming of You.&quot;
0670880728|4.0|I read this book because of all the hype.  Tahnk goodness that I listened ot the hype.  I found it extremely funny and entertaining.

B000002L68|5.0|Well, if the &quot;album-rock&quot; era started with Sgt. Pepper, then this is the best complete album of the rock n' roll era.  The songs flow together perfectly and they are all amazing.  No human being made better  music in the 80s than Prince, and this album proves that.

B000001F5P|5.0|Just before all the weak, hair-band posers took over MTV and all the rest turned to satan and speed, Heavy Metal was an underground force feared and respected in the early eighties.  Today it would seem ridiculous to place  the Scorpions in the same sentence as, say, Judas Priest, but back then, it  could be done because Heavy Metal had yet to fully develop all of its  splinter groups.  Heavy Metal was Heavy Metal, and the Scorpions, German  rockers buried in commercial obscurity for nearly a decade, were waiting  for a break.<br />In 1982, the Scorpions released &quot;Blackout,&quot; and  the rest, they say, is history.  Their third album with the same lineup  (the first sign of stability since they started - unless you count Michael  Schenker's guest appearance on &quot;Lovedrive&quot;), &quot;Blackout&quot;  features all of the hard, driving but melodic riffs and crisp production of  &quot;Lovedrive&quot; and &quot;Animal Magnetism&quot; but goes one step  further to produce the most intense album of their career.  Except for the  intro, verses and solo of &quot;You Give Me All I Need&quot; and the  album's closer, &quot;When The Smoke Is Going Down&quot; (NOTE: the fact  that WTSIGD is so superior a ballad to future tear-jerkers like &quot;Still  Loving You&quot; and &quot;Send Me An Angel&quot; is often lost because,  after the hyper-riff intensity of eight songs, listeners are more apt to  notice the mood change - but WTSIGD maintains the album's overall intensity  with the sincerity of vocalist Klaus Meine's refrains and thundering  powerchords), &quot;Blackout&quot; races with supercharged riffs at a manic  pace through the psychotic title track, the crowd-pleasing &quot;Can't Live  Without You,&quot; the hit &quot;No One Like You,&quot; the spastic  &quot;Now,&quot; the anthemic twin-guitar thrust of &quot;Dynamite,&quot;  the fun romp through &quot;Arizona&quot; and the slow but iron-chained  march of &quot;China White.&quot;  Look at the terrific cover!Original,  dynamic, insane (if not a bit scary), Rudolf Schenker's screaming face says  it all!<br />Klaus Meine faced the end of his career with voice surgery  following this album (hear the power and the screams and you'll  understand), but elected to stay on.  As great a singer as Meine is and  always was, his voice - as well as the rest of the band - never seemed to  match the intensity they achieved with &quot;Blackout.&quot;  Guitar solos  shredded back in the days when guitar solos didn't mean &quot;all tremolos  and hammers, all the time.&quot;  &quot;Newer&quot; lead guitarist Matthias  Jabs seemed to come alive for this album, and Schenker's rhythm guitar  matched, as usual, his songwriting skills.  The rhythm section - the only  slightly weak link in the Scorpion chain - also stepped up.  Drummer Herman  Rarebell does more than the simple four-on-the-floor patterns of albums  past, and while the production has limited the bass, Francis Buchholz has  always been a capable bottom end for all the activity around him.<br />It took  ten years (and several very good albums, by the way) for the Scorpions to  reach their full potential.  Two years later began the downward slope as  Heavy Metal became 1) chicks 2) hair 3) copy-Eddie-Van-Halen guitar solos  and 4) spandex and leather.  The music seemed to lose its significance -  and what a shame, because all the great bands like Judas Priest (remember  &quot;Turbo&quot;?), AC/DC (&quot;Fly On The Wall&quot;), KISS (anything  post makeup) began to age.  No wonder Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer took  over.  What a relief that the Scorpions, already veterans in a field they  felt was passing them by, made their biggest and best statement before the  industry and all its money and influence carried them and so many others  into a slow but ever-devastating decline.
B00000JCRH|5.0|This is by far the best Metallica album and best heavy metal album of all time. It breaks the rules of 80's American metal being nothing but noise, mixing good rock rhythm with high decibal speed. It also displays Metallica  frontman James Hetfield's incredible talent for strong and meaningful  lyrics. In a decade when most rock bands incouraged drug use, Metallica  sings of the horrors of cocaine addiction in the track, &quot;Master of  Puppets.&quot; also the aloneness and depression of the mentally ill in  &quot;Welcome Home (Sanatirium.) This is not an alubum for just hearing a  bunch of noise, this is the album for the intelectual metal fan...
B000002KNU|5.0|This album is a MUST for every Talking Heads fan. It's wonderful sound is simple yet complex and none of their proceeding work comes closes to touching it. Songs like Tentative Decisions and Happy Day are  masterpeieces. Psycho Killer is only the tip of the iceberg on this album.  The first track reels you right in and links together the rest of the  album. The sound is pure, melodic, and will change the way you look at  music, or at least the Talking Heads, forever.
B00000JCB2|1.0|For a cd that took this long to come out, it sure dosent sound like they took much time on it. The lyrics are weak and the songs have a just thrown together feal to them. I could listen to $3 dollar bill front to back with  out hitting the track skip at all, but unfortantly I'm skipping all over  the place with this one. Maybe I'm just being tough on them because it  seems like I've waited so long or maybe its the old &quot;Sophomore  Jinx.&quot; For now I'll keep listening to $3 and wait another 3 years for  thier next release.

6303534422|4.0|Well, I just have one thing to say, and that is the movie is GREAT!!  I watched this in '95, when I was in a mid teens and shall I say, &quot;I totally loved it!  Totally!!&quot;  Well, I watched again just recently and  I think that it's still a very good movie.  Though there are some details  that I'm sure people can fight about, but all in all, I think it's great  for all ages.  It's family value packed while having some teenage things in  there.  So, great movie.
0399143904|1.0|Tom, Tom, Tom, whatever happened to you? I thought that it could get no worse than Executive Whatever, but this book is a complete load of junk, and seemed to be even more like a vehicle for Mr. Clancy's rather paranoid,  narrow minded, self righteous view of the world and America's place in it  than the previous one. Serious issues such as enviornmentalism and  vegetarianism are reduced to activities for abnormal, doped up sixties  rejects. Whilst he considers himself a great expert on the Arab-Israeli  conflict and can expound to us at great lengths on it (not in this one,  admittedly, but in several of his others) he can think of nothing better  than to label the enviorenmental movement simplistically as a bunch of  deranged tree huggers. (Speaking of Mr. Clancy's expertise on international  relations and America's place in the world, I notice that pressing issues  such as Bosnia and the role and participation of the USA in some of the  recent important global movements like the eradication of landmines and the  establishment of an international war crimes tribunal are conspicuously  absent from his work. Nothing to say on them? Perhaps they don't fit in to  his image of the world.)  When I think back to his great books like Hunt  for Red October, Cardinal of the Kremlin and Clear and Present Danger, this  one bears no comparison. With regard to those books, another thing that has  seriously suffered is his character depiction and dialogue, the latter  being truly abominable in this book. About the only thing that this one has  going for it are the action scenes. There are still few people in the  business who can pace and write action like he can. By the way, Mr. Clancy,  a vegan, as you denote vegetarians throughout your book, are people who  touch neither meat, fish or dairy products. A vegetarian is someone who,  according to their choice, may eat fish and will often eat eggs and cheese,  and drink milk. There is a huge difference between the two (as least onthis side of the Atlantic). Better luck next time (though I'll never know,  as I'll never buy another Clancy book in my life, and that's a fact!)
B00000J6AG|5.0|Moby once again takes us on a musical journey, where blues mix with techno and gospel mixes with ambiance. The result: beautiful. Already hailed as a masterpiece Moby's recent CD &quot;Play&quot; is wonderful. Touching on  various musical styles Moby combines the raw beauty of soul voices with  smooth beats and hauntingly beautiful sounds from his piano.  This CD is  very mellow indeed, but does contain some heavy beats like  &quot;Bodyrock&quot;-which also manages to blend some hip-hop-which also  sounds great. But you'll know the real beauty on this CD once you hear it  and feel it.

6304118392|5.0|I first fell for this film by listening to Trent Reznor's soundtrack. I did not see it for the first time until 1996 and it was everthing that i had envisioned from the vivid portrait painted by the soundtrack. While  this film will never be considered a &quot;classic&quot; film to most  people it touches on many truths that prevail in our sick and twisted  society that TV and our mass media has shaped. I have the directors cut  version and if you listen closely to Mr Stone's commentary he ironically  points out how our media turns mass murder into a circus, he made these  statements in 1996 and look where the media has taken us today with the  Colorado trajedy. there are many people who will never &quot;get&quot; what  this movie is all about because they refuse to open their minds to what is  really going on in the world, and has been for decades. In the words of  Mickey Knox &quot;you aint seen nothin' yet.&quot;
6305171769|1.0|YUCH!What an awful movie.This doesn't deserve to be in the same category of Nightmare on Elm Street,or even a part of this series.If I could I would give this movie a zero,even a negative.I have seen hundreds of horror  movies since I was a boy, but this is slasher movies at its worst.It had no  good point,and the directing was awful too.Not enough killing,and flat out  boring.Not worth a penny of my money.Not scary at all.Steer clear of this  stinker.

B00000J7J7|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful, intelligent, and profound albums it's been my privilege to hear in a very long time. It is as dense and cerebral as the writings of Mann, yet immediately accessible as well. Read the  lengthy essay by Mehldau, an artistic and spiritual manifesto no less  fascinating than the music itself. I buy dozens of CDs every month, and  most of them get only one or two listenings, but this one is destined to be  in my CD player many, many times. A treasure.

It's a good thing Paltrow came along and helped  Shakespeare, or we would be lost (With a title like ROMEO AND &quot;ETHEL  THE PRIATES DAUGHTER&quot;)       I'm a big fan of William Shakespears  work, my favorite is shtill Hamlet, but this comes with a close tie.

0425163407|4.0|This was the second Kay Scarpetta novel I read.  I especially enjoyed the autopsy details, and (since I've missed several of the novels) the tidbits of the characters' pasts.  As with the other Kay Scarpetta book I read, I  found the pace of the writing to be a little tedious, however I enjoyed the  story enough to keep going. The way Cornwall handles the difficult social  issue of homosexual acceptance through the chracters of Ring and Lucy made  a nice side line to the progression of the story as a whole.  I look  forward to getting and reading more of Patricia Cornwall's Kay Scarpetta  novels.

0525457585|5.0|This wonderful book is a very deep story, full of wise lessons about courage, friendship, and love for both the reader and Bastian.  This book shows that hope is a gift in life. It shares the same lessons about life  and hope like the play The Raisin in the Sun.  That without hope or goals,  life would be a repeating circle. LIfe should be a straight neverending  line, full of mystery and dreams for everyone.
B000001EHS|5.0|All their albums are great and each one is even greater. They could sing happy birthday and it would be #1 on the charts.
1561005533|4.0|Although I enjoyed Birds of Prey better than this novel, I still found River God enjoyable.  It's an interesting foray into Egyptian life.  You learn while you enjoy the story being told.  Worth the read...
B00000IOSU|5.0|This album is so refreshing! Listening to it is like being set free.  The original recordings are gorgeous and the previously released live versions and remixes have been rich icing on the cakes of &quot;Surfacing&quot; and  &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.&quot; With &quot;Mirrorball&quot; you can  just pop it in, let your hair down and relax with an old friend.   <br />McLachlan's vocal stylings are rhapsodic, particularly on &quot;The Path  of Thorns.&quot; This &quot;Building a Mystery&quot; conveys an  undercurrent of rage that doesn't come through on the album or other live  versions.  Even fans of &quot;Possession's&quot; Rabbit in the Moon remix  will have to admit that this arrangement explores the landscape of manic  rage expressed in the lyrics.  It calls to mind, not only the misguided  fan, but the stricken image of the unwitting singer.   &quot;Good  Enough&quot; is less mournful and sympathetic, more angry and fed up with  the plight of the victim.  As always, the simplistic lyrics and energetic  conviction of &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot; encompass the basic theme of  romantic love: 'take me as I am.'<br />If we never hear another word from  McLachlan, her body of work thus far has certainly been contribution  enough.
B00000373U|5.0|I guess I'm kind of an Elliot Smith groupie... seen him in concert several times. In Seattle at a place called &quot;The Break Room&quot; with about 200 people. He played solo with acoustic guitar and was just great. Then  saw him in Boston near the end of his tour with a small band... larger  venue and was excellent. &quot;Either/Or&quot; greatly encapsulates the  things I like in Elliot. This is a CD you'll wear out.
B000001DYJ|5.0|This is by far my favorite KISS album.  This album is a MUST for any KISS fan.  It starts strong and never gives up.  It will beat you into submission.  Even the older songs sound fresh and new, even though some are  over 20 years old. It's not the 4 original members, but it's still a great  CD.  Even if you're not a KISS fan, it's a must-buy.  It's got everything  from fast hard rock to slow ballads.  But don't take my word for it.  Try  it yourself.  You won't be disappointed!!!
0316743003|5.0|As one who is neither engineer, military personnel or mathemetician, I was intrigued by this book.  The writing style, the perspectives contributed by others throughout -- and the story itself is fascinating.  A combination of  military detail, spy and black ops intrigue and aerospace history.  A must  read for those who want to see who and what it was that made this country  great.
B000002UJQ|5.0|generally my music taste falls within what I would call classic rock. so when this album was repeatedly recommended to me I was a tad bit skeptical.  when I did finally get around to buying it (almost a full year after its  release) I was absolutely enthralled.  since the time I purchased it there  has not been a single day when I have not listened to at least one track.   here lies the beauty of this masterpiece.  each track can be appreciated  singularly but  you must listen to the entire thing start to finish a dozen  or so times. then the songs start to etch a place in your heart. this album  began a love affair btw. myself and RHead.  I cannot get enough of them and  can only pray that they continue to record
B00000IPAX|5.0|I am proud to say that this is just another awesome album by Blink 182!!!  I have yet to hear a song I don't like from Blink 182, and I own all of their CD's...  They are one of the very few bands whose CD I can just start  from the beginning and just listen all the way through...  Among my  favorites off of Enema of the State include Dumpweed, What's My Age Again?,  and The Party Song...  I am even more pumped up for their Warped Tour  performance in my town!!!  Thanks Blink 182 for another awesome CD!!!
0340738448|5.0|I saw the preview of the movie a few weeks ago, and when I saw this on the shelf of my local bookstore, I just had to have it. The quality of this book is excellent for the price you pay. This edition is similar to the  Four Weddings and a Funeral screenplay published a few years ago by Corgi  Books (unfortunately no longer available - not to be confused with the  lower quality St. Martin edition) printed on high quality paper.  The full  colour photographs bring the script to life as you read it.  If you enjoyed  the film, BUY THIS BOOK!
B000002OX7|5.0|My top 5 rock albums:<br />1)  Rolling Stones - Exile on Main Street 2)  The Who - Who's Next 4)  Rod Stewart - Never a Dull Moment 4)  Guns N' Roses - Appetite for Destruction 5)  Allman Brothers - Live at Fillmore  East<br />Who's Next is a brilliant album - songwriting, playing, performance,  etc.  It is an absolute masterpiece, and is essential to anyone's rock  collection.  Also check out Tommy and Quadrophenia, also examples of The  Who in their prime.
6305014140|5.0|This anime is one of the best I've ever seen!!. And believe me, I've seen a LOT. The action is great and the animation is excellent!!. You have to buy this movie if you're an anime fan!!. It goes right on top along with  Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Vampire Hunter D, Neon Genesis Evangelion and  Macross Plus ( to mention a few). A most buy for Ninja fans.
B0000027I6|5.0|This album is a beautiful summary of our society at this point in time.  It's themes deal with the mixture of war and television.  And, Jeff Beck's accent in the background top the album off.
B000009PNY|5.0|I loved this tribute CD. A friend recorded it to me on a tape so i could listen to it and it was great: the old songs (lets be sincere: some of the first records are starting to show their age) were completely renewed,  recycled, and polished. And that's the fun of a tribute CD: the songs  aren't the original ones. You are listening to Smashing Pumpkins, but they  aren't the Smashing Pumpkins anymore, neither it is a DM song. It is  something completely new, fresh, and at the same time, well known for all  of us DM fans. Some of the songs are better than others, but well, that's  the way it is. I would have liked to see more known artists (how about pet  shop boys ? or Duran Duran ? or Orbital ? or NIN ? well, maybe the next  time).- FIVE STARS !
B000002KXV|5.0|1982 my brother and I were roomates in college. This album started our day-everyday. My brother found the CD many years ago. About a year ago he loaned it to a friend who never returned it. Many music stores have told us  it is out of circulation???!!! Figures I'd find it here. I bought two..one  for bro on his b-day and one for me. As with all Steely Dan/Donald Fagen  productions this is a must have. Start to finish an excellent way to start  the day (or end it!)Enjoy....
B000001Y42|5.0|This is one of those albums that your not sure if you like or not when you listen it to the first couple of times but over time grows on you. In fact, everytime I listen to this album it gets better. I'm pretty new to Limp  Bizkit and have only started listening to them in the past two weeks. Yes I  was introduced to them by &quot;Faith&quot;. However, now that I've heard  the rest of the album at least half a dozen times I would say that Faith  would be one of my least favorite songs. It's very short, not Limp Bizkit's  own song, and gets tired fairly fast. The other song I don't really care  for is the 16 minute song. Ok I admit it I haven't listened to the whole  thing. I just don't see the point of it except to fill up time. Yes  pollution, counterfeit, and Stuck are really cool but also noteworthy that  people have not mentioned are Leech (the heaviest song on the album) and  Song #10 (forgot the name..anyway a really good but very different song  than the others on the album). One thing that's strange. Has anyone else  noticed that track 10 is two songs but ONLY if you play faith (#9)  otherwise 10 is only one song. The second song is the one that I was  talking about above. Can't wait for Signifcant Other -- June 22nd!
0385483821|5.0|I find the book stimulate people to alert the environmental change, it is not only useful for business, bu also it is more useful for personal career development especially in the internet age. Andy's presentation is simple  and to-the-point, I finish the book in a non-stop 8 hours. I think all the  readers can benefit from the idea in the book.
B0000057C5|5.0|Totally rocks!! In concert even better, a lot of fire ( heh heh ) and explosions. Singing in German makes it even better. Rammstein goes to 11!
B000009ED0|5.0|I don't know where some people got the junk about this CD being country. This is rock and rap at its finest. It has blood pumping beats, smooth flows, and everything in between.
0767002652|5.0|I am sorry I purchased this set of videos.  I saw the entire original series on American T.V.. It was fabulous. This set selects various episodes and you find yourself totally confused because the necessary connecting  episodes are not included. Why didn't they do a set which includes all the  episodes?
B000002C1Z|5.0|actually pigs(3 diff) only the first pig is subjugating the working class. not sure what the second is about(an f-ed up old hag) the 3rd is about mary whitehouse, some kind of jerry fallwell in 70's england I guess.  Sheep is  about controlling the masses with religion, not subjugating the working  class. That's what I think anyway. 'the dogs(gods) are dead.' and remember  jesus' flock.
B000002U8G|5.0|With all the hype of Dark Side, the only PF albulm I had before I got this, I wasn't expecting it to be so good. Dark Side is a great albulm, but there's nothing on it I like as much as Echos (much as I like Time and the  rest). A 23 and a half minute, sensational track, it's definatly the  highlight of the albulm, but don't over look the other stuff, it's all  good.
6305169187|3.0|The plot was unrealistic and not well thought up. The plot was not really even there, the acting was terrible ( especially tylers daughter, join a band) it was funny and average at best. if you have a free year spend 2 and  a half hours on this.
B000006NPY|5.0|I didn't quite know what to expect from Billy and the gang when I first heard that they were bringing out a new album, but I like what I hear on it. As much as I like the heavier songs from their other albums, I also  found the quieter songs to be a nice break in between.
6304211740|5.0|I've read the book and seen all the movies and this is the best one. A perfect movie to watch when you're feeling blue. A must for all romantics. Excellent job!!!
B00000IOSU|5.0|If humans can create a perfect song, it must be on the new Sarah McLachlan CD.  I cannot believe how incredible the songs on this album are.  I know you've heard all the songs on this CD before, and probably thought that  they could not be redone in a way that would hold true to their original  form and improve them at the same time, but she has transcended any and all  barriers and created what might be considered the world's most perfect  album.  Hold On and Fear, as performed on this album, are undeniably two of  the most fantastic songs ever created by mankind. If you were forced to  only listen to one album for the rest of your life, you would want it to be  this one.
0380973464|4.0|Combining elements of pulp narrative within literary trappings, Stephenson manages to invest his story with wit, history and inscrutable characters. Although not quite as compelling as Snow Crash, this book shows tremendous  growth of Stephenson as an author.<br />Like most of Stephenson's book this  uses an elipticl narrative and epic length (as well as epic quality) to  highlight the extraordinary actions of (for the most part) ordinary, but  talented people. I was a little surprised while reading it as initially the  plot didn't sound like it would be compelling (and slogging through the  first 100 pages, like all Stephenson books, was a bit of a chore).<br />Stephenson still needs to develop his characters a little more fully.  Character development is all too frequently sacrificed to pithy  observations, or one diminsonal quirkiness masquerading as character.  Still, he is far and away of one of the most talented writers of his  generation.<br /> I couldn't put it down.
B000002MZ6|5.0|I have never really been a Mike Oldfield fan and it was a fluke that I purchased this one.  I happen to be an Arthur C. Clarke fan and the album titled with Clarke's book gained my curiosity.  There isn't a bad song on  this album - it is absolutely the best music I own and I never get tired of  listening to it.  It has very deep, ambient melodies that fit into any  mood.  If you don't get this CD - you are really missing out. Buy it, turn  it on and curl up with a good book and escape.
B00000JCB2|5.0|JUST BUY IT
0060977493|5.0|Roy lets us see the world of Southern India through the eyes of an inquisitive child and makes you feel, smell, and taste the life that surrounds the characters. And she does it with beautifully formed passages  and words. She really is the god of small things and this book is a  must-read for anyone who loves the art of language.
630516603X|5.0|To keep it short and simple this is an extremely entertaining video packed not only with group dance but with solo dance, beautiful song, and lively instrumental music.  The stunning performers in lighter sequences are as  graceful if not more than ballet dancers. Yet, the faster sequences are are  full of foot stomping, heart thumping, breath taking performances. One to  purchase and have on hand.
B000002UAO|5.0|I'm 13 years old, and the beatles have written some of my favorite albums.  While most Kids are listening to &quot;Americana&quot; and &quot;Pretty Fly For a White Guy&quot;, I'm listening to &quot;Drive my Car&quot; and  &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;.  Luckily, I have friends who I've exposed to this  disk, and they love it, too!  I guess there is hope for the true Classics.   Of the Beatle albums that I've heard, this is my favorite, and I think that  all the songs on it are equally good.  This one is right above &quot;Abbey  Road&quot;!
B000000W5L|5.0|It took me a while to get used to &quot;Exile&quot;, I had always loved Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, etc. But when I heard this the first time, I didn't quite know what to make of it. It finally sank in and I can tell you  its one of my favorites. This record rocks and even the ballads have a  groove all their own. Some people complain about the rough production, with  Mick buried in the mix, but as one article I read stated that he  &quot;sounds like a desperate man trying to claw his way out of a  grave.&quot; That sounds pretty much on the spot. This record comes closest  to the sounds of the original bluesmen that inspired the Stones to begin  with, and I don't know of any other artist or group that has ever come that  close at all.
6300151379|4.0|Why, oh why won't the studio re-release this? It's a classic for both children and Bowie fans - &quot;although things are not always as they seem&quot; - the demand alone should make the studio reconsider putting  this movie back on the shelves.
0380789019|4.0|I found the book very imaginative.  I finished it in three days.  I had just finished Dune when I picked up Neverwhere.  I found it just as enjoyable as Dune but admittedly not as complex.
B000002MFN|5.0|Madonna's best album ever! 'Bad Girl' is the best Madonna song ever written! I just wish she would release an Immaculate Collection 2 so I could see the beautiful videos from this excellent release again! If you only own 1 Madonna cd in your life it should be this one!
0375701427|1.0|Roth must have been &quot;owed&quot; a Pulitzer--this one isn't worth the effort of reading.  Fragmented, full of dead ends, illogical, and plodding.
B000003CMB|5.0|From the home of the Marshall Tucker Band and Joe Bennett's Sparkletones. I have loved this album for so long.Get it,love it... Duane Allman was proof that it is not the length of your life but the quality of your life  that matters.
6304675348|5.0|This was a great movie! I loved every minute of it. The acting was oscar worthy. I loved Neve Campbells' and Rose McGowans performances. This movie resurected the horror genre for the 90's. I'm a scary movie freak (I own over a hundred of em'),  and the new teen horror movies rock. 5 stars are not enough, I'd give this  movie 100 if I could!
B000005RT8|4.0|What an album!  After the lame mess of &quot;Back to the Egg&quot;, Paul disperses with Wings and sits at home with a basic Studer 4-track recorder.  This embrace of 'the new wave' from by then an aging master is fruitful in  it's own - I doubt Paul expected commercial success but rather to say that  Wings was done and I'm at home now (much the same messge  &quot;McCartney&quot; sent after the Beatles).  Keep in mind this was the  album before the brilliant &quot;Tug of War&quot;, his last gasp at true  commercial and creative success.  Some highlights include &quot;Temporary  Secretary&quot; (reminiscent of the war whoops from &quot;Too Many  People&quot;), &quot;Summer's Day&quot; and it's hypnotizing low-key beat,  the melodramatic &quot;One of These Days&quot;, and the outrageous  &quot;Darkroom&quot; with its various voice and beat mix.  Even  &quot;Coming Up&quot; ain't bad (better than the released live version).  But the best song by far has to be &quot;On The Way&quot;, with its searing  vocals and guitar work, obviously serving as the emotional and musical tie  to its historical forebearer, &quot;McCartney&quot;.  Nice work, Sir Paul.
B00000GRL0|3.0|This is by far, Lee's best movie, not because the fighting scenes are the best (they aren't; in fact, this is one of my least favorite Lee films, in terms of the martial art action) but because, -as opposed to all of his  other films- the plot and acting and actors are actually...pretty good.   The story is interesting as well.  Still, not enough action and a little  overrated.  Lee's most awesome fight scenes are his action scenes in Return  of the Dragon and Chinese Connection.  (Though, the LATTER film sucked  royally, in every OTHER respect).
0684867621|4.0|This was a great read.  The reader feels he/she is in the forest too.  Mystical yet real.  This is a book that should be read.
0792153367|5.0|It's really nice to watch this great movie. Audrey is so charming, beautiful and elegence. Moreover, the clothes inside are excellent too.
B000002KE2|5.0|This is it, kiddies. Sabbath crush you at one moment then weave a beautiful mellow sound the next. An absolute must have for your metal collection.
0553328255|5.0|Anyone not familiar with all of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes is truly missing out.  I first read The Complete Sherlock Holmes when I was 8 (not difficult reading and very enjoyable) and have been an afficionado ever since.   Holmes is, without a doubt, THE detective (see Irene Adler in &quot;A  Scandal in Bohemia&quot;).  This is the work that gave detectives a place  in literature.  All other mystery fiction stems from this.  A must-read.
B000000WCA|5.0|i accually have had this cd like almost as soon as it came out, but just never got around to writing a review.  I love this cd.  all of the songs are just fine for little kids, i think.  i know a lot of people disagree  with that, but when i was little my mom probably would have let me listen  to it.  anyway youll like this cd, unless, of course, you dont.  but i like  the cd, and my favorite band is the spice girls.
B00000IOSU|5.0|This is the best Sarah CD out there. I love live recordings -- this one has all the emotion and more. Her studio albums tend to drag out by the end - this one will keep your interest and make you want to play it again.
0553378384|5.0|Jan Spiller's descriptions of the individual by nodal position are uncannily accurate.  The book demonstrates beyond a doubt the extreme importance of the nodes in the birth chart.  I found the section that  applied to me remarkably on-target.  I also find it extremely useful, and I  have read it over many, many times and will probably continue to do so.  It  serves as a constant and ever-ready reminder to me of what I need to do to  get and stay in touch with my inner energies, and what my in-grained  psychological and behavioral pitfalls are that I must seek to overcome or  transcend in this lifetime.  Just take a look at the book in a bookstore  and see if the section that applies to you seems on target.  My guess is  that it will and you will see how valuable this book is.  I sought out Jan  Spiller for a reading after reading the book and I think she is a  phenomenal astrologer.
B00000JCB2|5.0|I haven't heard the entire cd yet but i can just tell that it is going to rock after hearing nookie. I can't wait to get the cd and hear it live when they tour this summer.
B000002C1X|3.0|Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; attempts to do with a double album what Alice Cooper's &quot;School's Out&quot; did with a 3 minute single--not to mention Supertramp's &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; with a single album.  &quot;The Wall&quot; has it's moments--actually, some great moments--but  there's a lot of fluff in between. This could have been tightened up into  one great single album, or at least a double album short enough to fit on a  single CD!

0792151712|4.0|In the grand tradition of 60's style epics, Titanic can make you fall in love with it or leave you cold. To each his own. Taste notwithstanding, this is a film of collosal proportions and incredible special effects. So  Leonardo Di Caprio doesn't shine all that much? So the dialog is a tad off?  The ensemble is what makes this film the blockbuster it became, thanks in  great part to the support of 14 year olds. Watch it for the drama of the  ship and its passengers and for the outstanding effects.
B000002KO3|5.0|Heard that record in my car about 50 times and it got never boring(except the song &quot;the overload), which says it all. My all-time favourite together with &quot;More Songs about Buildings and Food&quot;.
6302824613|4.0|The worst film I ever enjoyed
B0000020C4|5.0|I swear that this is the best cd that I own. The cast includes some of the best singers I've ever heard; especially Philip Quast. Micheal Ball is excellent too. You won't be dissapointed with this CD. Just listen to  Philip Quast sing Stars; it will make your knees weak!
B000002BUY|1.0|this is one of the worst CDs i own.  i got it cuz i really liked new skin on the family value's cd.  there are only a few good songs on this cd but the rest is a load of @#$%.  this was just a waste of money.  i greatly  advise u not to get this cd if u like &quot;new skin&quot; or any hardcore  music such as KoRn, LB, static-x, coal chamber or any others for that  matter.  to sum things up THIS CD BLOWS!
B000002VC5|5.0|His best album and a great story set to music
1573226521|5.0|Alex Garland defines the modern day Gen-Xer. The Beach is a novel to take notice of.  It invites the reader into the world of an unheard utopia.  This is a novel which the reader gains not only insight to what peace could  be, but an insight to themselves as well.  Although a work of fiction, this  touches on the real feelings that runs through the minds of every person  from our generation.  I believe that this is a breakthrough novel and well  worth the read.
0790701251|5.0|I rated this movie a classic the first time I saw it. While many would disagree with me, I believe it is the first part of the movie that makes it a classic.<br />The depiction of life in a military boot camp, with all the  indoctrination, dehumanizing and debasement that goes on makes you shake  your head when we pause and realize that these are, in many cases, only 18  and 19-year-old boys that we train to be killers without remorse.<br />The  battle scenes were okay, but overall, I thought it was how they showed  regular, All-American kids and turned them into ravenous beasts that really  made the movie.
0062502182|5.0|It did mine.  Never before have I read a book that defined the aquisition of one dreams with such simplicity.  This book truly moved me and has become a guide.  It will for you too.  Read this book.  And always keep a  copy of it with you.
0446605409|3.0|This book, like the recent works of other major best selling authors, is a good novel but suffers from the idea that anything the author writes is gold.  As a consequence, the book is about 1/4 too long.  Even though  DeMille's dialog is often funny, you wind up wishing he'd get a move on his  story.  The novel is good, but nowhere up to his best efforts.
B00000DBXL|5.0|First off, their concert last night at the Tabernacle (Atlanta) was the best rock show I have ever seen, and I'm an eye doctor (seriously).  Anyways, about the album, their lyrics are downright potent.  Let's quote a  few, shall we?   1.  Allright, Oh no, Aahh yeah! (Songs #1-13) 2.  I was  high, but she was the sky (Mexico #2) 3.  The way you treat me likely only,  slightly brings me down alot (Guitar #4) 4.   I'm not feeling allright  today, I'm not feeling that great (If you don't know, why are you reading  this?) Their quirky tunes and eclectic influences chime true with this  physician.  I especially like their use of some &quot;country only&quot;  instruments like the musical saw and the lap steel guitar.  By the way,  could someone please e-mail me as to what a &quot;band pipe&quot; is?  Remember, As soon as you're born you start dying.
0802130208|5.0|I read this book &quot;off the shelf&quot; several years ago, never having heard of John Kennedy Toole...simply picked it up as I liked the title...and was definitely intrigued by the posthumous Pulitzer. I have  read some of the positive, as well as negative reviews of this most  unusual, unnerving, and most unfortunately truthful novel. <br />It saddens me  to think that those who found Ignatius to be a repulsive and impossible  character can't see that Ignatius was/is the author and not some fictional  character, but a young man, willing to lay his pain out on each page for  the world to witness. Saddest of all perhaps, that there are those who were  fortunate enough to have been given this rare and uncensored look into the  life of such a very, very, lonely man to have not learned from the  magnitude of his gift to us all...a rare chance to experience the pain of a  stranger,without obligation and having had this, not to have read the last  page with at the very least a readiness to accept others, for whatever, or  whoever they might be. <br />I have read perhaps 3,000 novels in my life and  am proud to say that I can feel this man's pain in all of his oddities and  idiosyncrasies...for he is no different than all of us...he lived, perhaps  not in a way that most of us will ever admit to...but in a way that we can  all admittedly or not, understand.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who  can accept that we are all different, yet all the same...to be different is  not always the accepted thing, but is most always better than being just  like everyone else.<br />Read this book with an open mind, heart, and room in  your soul for forgiveness... for Ignatius is certainly not a very likeable  character, but in the end (as in the beginning) he is human no more or less  than you or I however, unlike you or I, he chose to bear his soul and asks  for no forgiveness just acceptance and verification that yes, he did live.

B000005TQO|5.0|This CD was loaned to me when I began studying Italian.  I fell in love with it!  I didn't understand most of it but this CD proves that music is the Universal Language.  I found myself feeling very emotional with many of  the songs especially soundtrack #2.  They touched my soul!  You don't need  to know what she is saying.  You feel the heartfelt setiments.  It's  beautiful, fun and she's got a great voice!  I ended up going out and  buying all her CDs!  I love them all. This one is probably my favorite  though.  Bravo!  Bravo!
0553213105|5.0|There is no wonder why this was the story You've Got Mail was based on!  I also agree that Colin Firth himself is worth watching the movie, but the fact that it is so true to the novel is incredible!  Trust me, if more  stars were available, I'd use them.  Austen is awesome!
B000002AH1|4.0|When I first tried listening to this album, at the age of 19, I found it... intimidating.  Its restless energy and bizarre oceans of sound were almost frightening.  Because of this I was always fascinated by it, and  went back to it over the years until I really got to like it.  At times it  seems that Miles has achieved something that isn't quite music but isn't  non-music either --- &quot;that which description may never justify.&quot;   Those who are accustomed to the jazz styles of the 50s and 60s may find  this a tough listen, but it's well worth the effort, for its sheer wildness  and reckless courage.  A major effort by one of the authentic musical  geniuses of the 20th Century.
0553573403|5.0|As a relatively new reader of sci-fi and fantasy, I hadn't read too many of the current popular fantasy series, so I started with Jordan's books.  While they were enthralling and the world he builds is amazingly detailed,  my foray into the Seven Kingdoms in George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and  Fire series has been just as enjoyable.  I can't decide my favorite of the  two authors, but I will tell you what I like about A Game of  Thrones.<br />First observation:  Things happen.  After reading entire  chapters of Jordan's later novels that only stew in their own contemplative  juices without actually going anywhere, it was refreshing to experience a  little adventure and excitement with each chapter in AGOT.<br />Second  observation:  Women are authentic.  I'm not sure if I phrased that  properly, but here's what I mean.  After a while, Jordan's portrayal of  women gets really annoying.  Maybe it's just me, but they all seem so  similar and uninteresting most of the time.  In AGOT the female characters  are some of my favorites and they seem like real people to me.<br />I hope  that anyone who is reading this looking for a potential fantasy novel to  bide their time until the next Jordan book comes out will immediately add  this worthy tome to their shopping cart.  You may find yourself counting  the days until the next Martin book rather than the next Jordan book if  you're not careful.
B00000J7S8|5.0|This new CD is terific!  I especially like the old standards with Diana's unique interpretations.  My favorite is &quot;Let's Fall in Love&quot;.  The bonus track  &quot;Why Should I Care&quot; is a true unexpected extra.   Lots of variety--slow to upbeat, fun to forlorn.  Congrats to the group  that produced this CD.
0195073401|5.0|Easily the best micro-text available on the market. The authors have done a great job in explaining the concepts. Following the rigorous mathematical derivations is the economic intuition behind the results. All the  assumptions underlying the results are clearly stated. They prove many of  their claims. They cover a topic fairly completely unlike Varian who seem  to be in hurry to finish off as soon as he has started. Unlike Kreps they  don't waste time and space chatting with the reader. Most importantly,  investing time and effort solving the exercises gives one great confidence  and ability to read research papers in professional journals.
0930289234|5.0|As noted by almost all the reviewers of this book, &quot;Watchmen&quot; is a comic experience unparalleled by almost everything before or, sadly, since its creation. The highest complement that can be paid it, I think, is  that it crosses the boundaries between comic art and &quot;real&quot; art,  proving that a grand story is not exclusive to novelists and short story  writers.  The &quot;lesser arts&quot; can hold their own when inspiration  and craftsmanship work hand in hand. This is a wonderful comic that  disturbed me as a teen and enthralls me as an adult.

0805211063|2.0|I've had a lifelong obsession with Kafka, but his novels I can do without. This book is very tedious to get through, and if the point is to make me experience firsthand that that's how dealing with bureaucracy  feels--tedious, then I can just go wait in lines at my local DMV for that  big revelation. Better to read any of his short stories. There was a reason  these novels weren't published in his lifetime--even he himself felt they  weren't quite finished or ready for the reader's eye.
B00000IQV1|5.0|Robin Williams is a great actor his movies touch  people all over the world and this movie expecially because it combine laughter with crying and also makes you relize the real things in life and what everyone is going  through.It is a touching story and it also gets to people who are actually  are going through the same things that are in the movie.It is a must see  movie.
B00000J7J4|5.0|I coudn't wait to get my hands on this new release and I think it's absolutely wonderful ! The first cut (DaLe) Yaleo will make you want to leave your cares behind and boogie. This song puts a smile on my face and  warmth in my soul. The collaboration with Lauren Hill is beautiful as is  the last song with Eric Clapton, The Calling. The artists performing on  this album love and respect Carlos Santana and the result is felt  throughout.Carlo's guitar soars and this is clearly a man whose talent just  increases with time . Great album....
0812550706|5.0|This is a series of the best books is by far the best I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Even after finishing the novels in this four book series I find myself wishing it would continue into a fifth and sixth. If  anyone was  ever worthy of the Huge/Nebula awards it would be Orson Scott  Card.
0784011796|4.0|&quot;Pi&quot; was this mysterious movie that played for a short time at a local movie theater.  I had absolutely no clue about it, but I was fascinated by the movie poster, a huge pi symbol with the caption:   &quot;Faith in Chaos&quot;.<br />That explanation is perfectly suited for this  film.   Entering the mind of a  schizophrenic madman/mathematic genius was  exhilarating.  I have to admit, this film is not for everyone.  <br />The  cinematography is very dizzying (to the point of nausea), and the plot is  quite abstract.  However, if you watch this at least once, and take the  time to think about the messages conveyed about religion and the power of  finding universal truth, you will be mystified (although slightly sick to  your stomach)<br />See it once....it may not be your favorite, but you won't  regret it.
B000002GFU|5.0|This CD is a &quot;must-have&quot; for any music lover, not  to mention &quot;Harold &amp; Maude&quot; fans.  I think &quot;Miles  from Nowhere&quot; is truely my favorite.  Sometimes  it sounds as if Mr. Islam  is coming right through  my stereo.  I'd like to see the sales rank of   this one become #1!!!!!!!!!!
0553212478|4.0|With lyrical language, the story of a university student who animates a creature composed of parts of various corpses unfolds, exposing the shallowness of the human mind and its immature horror of anything different  or strange. The hideous creature that young Victor brings to life, is  spurned by his creator and forced to find its own way in the world, which  it finds is impossible due to general human hostility. Ultimately, it is  the story of an irresponsible parent who makes a life he is unwilling and  unable to care for, and the terrible results of such a mistake.
0790736942|5.0|It would surprise nobody to have me say that &quot;The Exorcist&quot; is a great horror film.  But I want to go a great step further: it's one of the most brilliant and striking films ever made, period.  In the documentary  which preceeds the film on the 25th anniversary edition, author William  Peter Blatty says that it is a film which provokes a reaction -- love it or  hate it, you're alive during while you watch this film.  This is what great  art is all about.  &quot;The Exorcist&quot; is far from being just a film;  it's a visceral experience.  Director William Friedkin researched great art  (paintings, literature) to use as a springboard into the story, and it  shows in every carefully constructed shot.  We learn in the documentary  that Friedkin was obsessive in his meticulous attention to detail, and, as  hard as it was for the cast and crew, it shows in every frame.  Each moment  of this film is carefully considered and executed, just like the works of  art Friedkin used as inspiration...and, like all great art, they take on a  life of their own.  And finally, the possession which is at the film's  center is the heart around which the story's characters move -- all flawed,  real, and human.  Faith is at the film's core, and it resonates throughout.  Please make sure to purchase the widescreen version, as every shot is  filled with detail and will be greatly harmed by pan &amp; scan; in  addition, a dialogue in the documentary between Blatty and Friedkin about a  cut final scene gives additional insight into the film's subtext.  This is  a film about faith, and it tells its story in a seamless and harrowing  style which is ultimately unforgettable.  &quot;The Exorcist&quot; is a  true classic.
0553266306|5.0|The only thing I regret about The Day of the Jackal is that I saw the movie first, so I knew basically what the storyline was before I ever picked up the book.<br />However, what kept my interest up in reading the book  was Forsyth's constant attention to intricate details, fascinating details  that really painted the picture a lot more fully and clearly--and without  giving away what was going to happen.<br />And let's not forget the basic  characters of the book--they were quite realistic in their thinking and in  their actions based upon that thinking.  The mark of a great author, at  least as far as I see it, is the ability to create such realistic  characters and not have to resort to contrivance to make a point.<br />I  touched on this a bit earlier, but I don't want to forget to mention  specifically about the way Forsyth expertly kept the suspense building  until the climactic point near the end.<br />I could go on, but I would be  giving away specific plot details by doing so.<br />I strongly recommend for  anyone to read this book.  I can virtually guarantee that (s)he will not be  disappointed in the least.  Whether the reader's main interest is history,  suspense, or just a good story doesn't matter.
B00000592F|5.0|Die hard Procol Harum fans never got over Robyn Trower's departure.  They would bemoan his loss and turn a closed ear to subsequent recordings.  The truth of the matter is, that Procol continued to make outstanding records  well after Trower left the band.  In fact, as a whole, the post-Trower  albums were more consistent and stronger than those recordings made prior.   This disc, Exotic Birds and Fruit, is one of the two best discs recorded by  P.H. in this period(The other being Grand Hotel). There is not a weak song  on the disc.  The production and musicianship are outstanding and equally  creative. This is a stellar band at it's peak as a collaborative ensemble.   Highly Recommended.....Simon
6304167660|5.0|Beautiful Girls is a great lighthearted comedy mixed with certain aspects of drama. The attractive, however unlikely, romance between Timothy Hutton and the ever adorable and loveable Natalie Portman stole the show (and my  heart). If you have not seen Beautiful Girls and are looking for a laugh, a  cry, and a feel-good movie, I strongly suggest that you go pick up a copy.
0679720200|1.0|Being unnaturally obsessed with Kafka, it was assumed by my compadres that I would also like this author, and particularly this book. How wrong they were. The plot makes no sense, the characterization is meager &amp;  unconvincing, and the only poetic prose occurs on the last page as our hero  (ha!) languishes in prison in the final hours before he is to be executed,  wondering what it all means &amp; railing at humanity for treating him like  the dog he is.
B00000DMJF|5.0|This album sparks much debate....is it brilliant as it is, or should it have been whittled down to a single album? Personally I fall on the former side of that arguement. But either way, the best parts of the White Album  is timeless, totally brilliant rock &amp; roll. The lesser stuff is still  quirky and quite fun, with the natural exception of &quot;Revolution  #9&quot;.  John &amp; Paul are at the peak of their writing &amp; vocal  forms here, George delivers a couple of his best, and even Ringo  contributes a decent track (it's no Lennon/McCartney, but it's still a  hummable ditty). Whereas with &quot;Revolver&quot; thru &quot;Magical  Mystery Tour&quot;, the Beatles were exploring differnt sounds, the  &quot;White Album&quot; captures them exploring new styles of songs and new  ways of breaking the limitations of the pop song. And in the end, dispite  it's range (and the inevitable break-up that began during the sessions for  this album), it's still a joyous romp. I could go on, but I'll save you the  trouble; it's one of the greatest albums ever recorded. Far reaching,  endlessly influential, and as timeless as ever.<br />Now as far as this 30th  anniversary re-issue goes...I personally noticed a difference in the sound  quality, admittedly not a great deal though. That's because the Beatles,  Apple &amp; Capitol got it right the first time by entrusting the digital  mastering of the albums to George Martin. The only way to improve it is to  utilize the &quot;20 bit rematering&quot; process to make up for the  limitations of the cd medium itself (a long technical explaination here  that I won't bore you with).<br />The packaging, however, is exquisite.  Packaged as a scale replica of the original vinyl pressing, complete with  the invisible raised lettering in the title &amp; a serial number, the 4  solo pictures &amp; the poster all reproduced on a smaller scale. Even the  label on the cd itself is true to the original. May not seem like much, but  to a truefan, it's a great thing.<br />There are only 500,000 copies of this  issue out there, so it's bound to become a collectors item. It's a neat  package, but admittedly it's a thing for the real fans only. No matter  which release you get, it's the music that really matters. And you can't  lose here. Positively brilliant.
0321012542|5.0|One mans word is seen written in the pained faces of every man across the all, in the hands of the desperate at their acts of desperation, in the wiles of all lovers, whether tragic or fanciful, in the chucklings of  saints, satyrs, and sinners. I could never be bombastic enough to  voiciferate the magnificence of Shakespeare. Shakespeare perhaps isn't  bombastic enough. He is the greatest writer ever to have lived. The race  that he gathered in his multifarious tapestries of painful wonder should  flood his grave with tears of gratitude. Weep,love,hate,laugh,progenate,and  read Shakespeare. All else is an imitation thereof. my icq is 17149282,drop  me a line
015670160X|5.0|Orlando is simply wonderful. In the novel, Woolf uses the character of Orlando, a person who lives through four centuries as man sometimes and woman sometimes. The term biography might throw you, since Orlando is no  normal biography. Woolf personifies literary thought as a person (hence the  timelessness and gender changing capability). She depicts Elizabethan times  through the early twentieth century with wit and sarcasm. The more that  you've read of English literature from Shakespeare forward the more you  will catch the little jokes and the reason for why certain things happen. A  very enjoyable read. The film version is not exactly the same, so I  recommend sticking to the book.
0553278223|4.0|This book is about the founding of Mars as a US territory, and the effects of the mass emigration on the continental countryside as well as the politics of civilizing a new area. This is exactly the year when the events  of the novel were projected to take place, and what is most fascinating is  how differently history actually turned out than Bradbury imagined.  Published in 1950, Bradbury never foresaw the civil rights movement and the  integration of all races in this country. Instead, while still muttering  &quot;yessirs&quot; and deferring to the white man, every single black  citizen of the US flees to Mars to be free. Women are also frozen in time  in his depiction of the future, with the more subtle issues of  discrimination and reproductive freedom completely ignored. It just goes to  show you what a dramatic effect political organization and protest can  really bring. But let me step off my soapbox to finally say that this is  definitely a classic work of science fiction to wrap your mind around.
B00000JCRH|5.0|This is the second best rcording in Metal History....Reign in Blood being #1. That said, this is by far Metallica's most consistent effort.  All you kiddies who got into Metallica after the black album, just listen and  learn.
6305263299|5.0|The most important thing I can say to you if you are considering the purchase of this wonderful film is - GET THE GERMAN VERSION.  Herzog did NOT just dub the German into English.  He actually shot the film in two  languages simultaneously.  The German version is much more natural for the  actors, since they were speaking their native language (mostly).  If you  are one who abhors subtitles and ignore my advice, so be it.  The big  screen is essential to fully appeciate this one, so do the best you can.  The images are unforgettable, and Kinski's performance is one of his best.  Fairly devoid of violence, so you can share it with younger viewers.  If  you like this one and want to see more Herzog films check out Aguirre,  Wrath of God - his best.
B000002GJS|3.0|When I first heard this album, I didn't know if crying or laughing was in place. Like Desmond Child screwed up Alice Cooper, so has Mutt Lange done with Bryan. Lange just couldn't leave it alone, he had to go and turn what  was once &quot;The Bryan Adams Band&quot; into &quot;The Def Leppard  Band&quot;.  -But worst of all; he made Bryan sing like Joe Elliott.  Sorry, but this is where I (a fan since '83), and all other serious  Adams-fans, quit. The 3 stars are solely for the brilliant guitar-work on  this album, nothing else.
0451169514|2.0|This book was way too long. King crafted some very believable BOY children, but the role of the one girl was inexcusably offensive and exploitative. I have to admit that this is the most terrifying novel I have  ever read. But despite its effective frightening powers, because of the bad  plotting, outrageous sexism, lack of economy of writing, and horribly lame  ending, I have to give it only two stars. My hope is that King will rewrite  it someday to salvage what is, underneath, an overwhelmingly scary and good  book.

B00000BKDY|5.0|The year was 1987.  I was the DJ at a dance for high-school-age kids at a summer camp.  Amid all the Oingo Boingos and Depeche Modes I played &quot;Deja Vu&quot;, a rapid, pop-oriented excursion off Iron Maiden's 1986  masterpiece, &quot;Somewhere In Time.&quot;  And you know what?  Most of  the kids stayed on the dance floor and kept right on dancing!  I am sure I  am the only DJ in the world who ever did this (at least successfully) and  it is a moment for which I am forever proud.<br />Many longtime fans dis  Somewhere In Time because the band took Powerslave's intricate  arrangements, epic songwriting, lofty lyrics and guitar synthesizer (NOT  keyboards!)- good for filling out Iron Maiden's linear guitar structures -  a step beyond and produced an album far more mature than  &quot;Killers&quot; and &quot;Number of the Beast.&quot;  No matter.   Somewhere In Time works because with all of the artistry remains the  intensity.  Bassist Steve Harris' songwriting skills are still in full  force, and the twin-lead-guitar attack of Dave Murray and Adrian Smith  turned up a notch to give each song a more melodic feel (especially  &quot;Loneliness ... &quot;, &quot;Deja Vu&quot; and &quot;Alexander  ...&quot; ) to correspond with Harris' excellent furious but intricate  thump-along bass and Nicko McBrain's terse, brilliant drumming.   &quot;Caught Somewhere In Time&quot; and &quot;Sea of Madness&quot; rock as  hard as anything since &quot;Piece of Mind,&quot; and Bruce Dickinson's  voice maintained its preeminent position as one of heavy metal's finest  before it began to show signs of wear on &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh  Son.&quot;  Iron Maiden harnessed all of its progressive and hard rock  influences to release an album that reveals a band at the peak of its  artistry and maturity.  You can't sing about beasts, harlots and battles  forever.<br />Iron Maiden was a leader in album artwork, and Somewhere In  Time's futuristic motif made for an incredible contrast to the ancient,  cryptic &quot;Powerslave.&quot;  Eddie never looked better, and Iron Maiden  never sounded better.  Judas Priest's K.K. Downing often remarked how Iron  Maiden was a Priest rip-off.  Well, let's see ... Within a year of each  other Iron Maiden released &quot;Live After Death&quot; and &quot;Somewhere  In Time.&quot;  Judas Priest put out &quot;Turbo.&quot;  What would you  rather listen to?
B0000026T4|1.0|When this album first came out back in '89, I didn't know if I should laugh or cry. I just couldn't believe that Alice would stoop to this. Desmond Child is without a doubt the worst thing that has ever happened to  him. Some people just have the wrong idea about how Alice Cooper is  supposed to sound, and Coop listened to the wrong guy this time. Variety  used to be one of the best things about Cooper albums, but here you get  none, only monotony. This is a textbook example on how not to do it if  you're a serious artist, and I had always thought that Alice was. -But the  &quot;hairspray-period&quot; of any artist is always the lowpoint  music-wise, and such were the late 80's. (The worst album is still  &quot;Raise Your Fist...&quot;.) - Admit it Alice, you know I'm right. Was  this really the album you wanted to make, or did other people want you to  ?. Whatever, Trash stinks.
0156907399|2.0|Woolf has a canny ability to explore the secret hidden motives and interior monologues of all her characters, but in this book she chooses some pretty unnoteworthy subjects. I'm not sorry that I read this book, but  I really wouldn't recommend it. Though it does have its share of beautiful  and insightful passages, mostly it just rambles.
0451191153|5.0|The literary value of The Fountainhead can be questioned.  It's fundamental theme cannot.  The story of a brilliant creator refusing to lower his standards to please the mediocrity worshipping herd stands as a  classic.  For those readers who simply abhorred this work, I would not be  surprised to learn that upon discovery of the character of Peter Keating,  you saw yourself exposed for the second-hander that you are.
B000002LRX|5.0|If you like good music in general, you need to have this CD in your collection.  Faith No More is one of the most talented and versatile bands to ever exist, and this album fully reflects the bands talent.

B00000IOSU|5.0|Ever since I heard 'Angel' I've never known what limits music can achieve for the soul. It is ultimately the most beautiful song ever written in recent years, and the live version here is intense and soothing at the same  time. No other song has made me want to embrace my girlfriend more  desperately. I was surprised, however, to note that the most powerful song  here is &quot;Do What I Have to Do&quot;. These two songs more than  compensate for the other tracks here, some of which are also good.
B00000J2KT|1.0|Why was Full Metal Jacket not released in widescreen format? If it had been, I would've given it a much higher review.
B000002AP1|4.0|As someone who clung to the original album of Raw Power like a life preserver at one point in my life, I was pleased to see that someone finally took it upon themselves to upgrade the album's sound.   But: there  are some changes on this album.  Most of which I really like: the  &quot;1-2-3-4&quot; count into &quot;Shake Appeal&quot;; the new  &quot;hey!&quot;s on &quot;Search and Destroy&quot;; the extended ending of  &quot;Death Trip&quot;.    However, the guitar solo on &quot;Raw  Power&quot; is NOT the solo that appeared on the original album.  Having  spent more hours than I care to admit playing that spiraling-out-of-control  James Williamson explosion over and over again, I was more than a little  dismayed to hear a similar but still different solo on the song I loved so  much.   And the guitar solo at the end of &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; is  mixed way down from the original release.   Not like it matters - this is  the way Raw Power will be forevermore, and that's alright.  The sound is  substantially better, especially in the lower frequencies, and the Iggy Pop  interview in the liner notes is funny and informative.   So: a slight  letdown in some ways, but still snarling and alive and revelatory in ways  that Limp Biskit won't ever be.  Get it now.
6300270424|2.0|This is certainly good by the high standards of hard rock.  There are interruptions in the concert footage which I believe is unnecessary. I'm no fan of Deep Purple but I have to say its Machine Head video is the best  video ever.  I'm a great fan of progressive bands and this video is still  considered a disappointment
B00000JGOH|5.0|When I watched the Academy Awards I was quite surprised that this film won academy awards for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, among others...  However, I also had not seen the other nominated films  (Elizabeth, Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, and Life is Wonderful).  I  was thinking that one of the war films would have to win Best Picture, but  now that I have seen them I must say that Shakespeare in Love is easily the  best film of the bunch.  It has wonderful acting, beautiful scenery and  costumes, and a very interesting story.  This is not my favorite movie at  all but it is up there.  People kept on saying that Kate Blanchet should  have gotten best actress, but personally I think she did not have nearly as  good of a performance.  In fact, I think Elizabeth was quite a sleeper.  I  would give that a 3 or so...  See this film.  It is well worth any amount  you must pay to see it.

B000008GEF|5.0|This was an album that I borrowed from a friend way back in the 70s but decided not to add to my post-Beatles collection for various reasons.  It wasn't as exciting as say Band on the Run, or as emotionally compelling as  Plastic Ono Band, or as accessible as Ringo, so I passed on it at the time.   It just didn't appeal to the teenager in me.  Recently, I picked up the  album (that's right- a vinyl disc) and have been getting reacquainted with  it after all the years in between.  I'm surprised at how well this album  works as a concept album- something the Beatles were noted for in their  heyday.  The concept may be spiritual but I don't feel it really detracts  from the quality and cohesiveness of the work.  The music is fantastic, the  production isn't overblown (for the most part), and if you just listen to  it without making a judgement about the preachy attitude it stands up quite  well indeed to the best of Harrison's work.  The man obviously cared about  the project and I see much more in common with All Things Must Pass (ATMP)  than first meets the eye.  Like ATMP, it features many slow and intricately  arranged songs with a few twists added for good measure.  Sue Me, Sue You  Blues is every bit as playful as Apple Scruffs and- despite the title and  message of this album- goes back to George's obsession with things of a  financial nature much the same as Taxman did back when he was Fab.  Give Me  Love is just a great song and could easily have been part of ATMP in my  opinion.  Don't Make Me Wait Too Long is a spiffy, upbeat little love song  (as harmless and almost as fun as Paul's Silly Love Songs), and the title  track is really one of the most interesting (cynical?) songs in any solo  Beatle's discography with an inside view of the group.  I love the lyrics:  &quot;Though we started out quite poor, we got 'Richie' on a tour.&quot; I  would have ended the record with The Day the World Gets 'Round instead of  with That Is All but that's the worst I can say about this album. I also  remember passing on Dark Horse.  Hmmm... Wonder if I can track that down in  vinyl...
B000002H97|1.0|I woke up early on a Tuesday in August of 1991 just so I could buy the new, self-titled Metallica album. I went straight home, put it on and listened to the whole thing once...and never had a desire to listed to it  again. For those of you who are considering buying this recording:YOU HAVE  BEEN WARNED--THIS ALBUM IS A LOAD (PUN INTENDED) OF RADIO-ORIENTED CRAP! I  have heard (unintentionally, mind you) snipets of later releases, and I  have to say that Metallica's sound is very different from earlier releases,  and this album was the turning point. If you think Master of Puppets and  ..And Justice For All are the best metal albums you have ever heard, steer  clear of this one. I blame producer Bob Rock (who produced Motley Crue, Bon  Jovi) for this album--I blame Metallica for the others that came after it.
B000002KCC|5.0|Unlike &quot;Harvest&quot; or &quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&quot;, Neil digs deep into his emotions after the loss of his friends, Bruce Berry and Danny Whitten, and creates his most expressive album.  Criticized by  some as sloppy and unrehearsed, these elements actually set the mood for  this superb offering.  Songs like &quot;Albuquerque&quot; and the title  track seem slow and slurred, but certainly intended -- as if the band had  been on an all-night drinking binge just before recording. Bruce and Danny  would have been proud!  Since you have to be lucky to find &quot;American  Stars &amp; Bars&quot; on CD these days, pick up this  &quot;number&quot;...for the road.
B000002J29|5.0|This is, hands-down, the absolute BEST LIVE ALBUM EVER MADE BY ANY BAND!!!  (The only album that comes close is Jimmy Buffett's &quot;You Had to Be There&quot;)  If I had to own just one Genesis cd(s), this would definitely  be it!  I would give my left arm to go back in time to see and hear them on  the night(s) they recorded this.  Every song on this album is fantastic.   The two that really stand out are &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot; and  &quot;Supper's Ready&quot;, both of those give me shivers every time I hear  them.  Steve Hackett is brilliant.  Collins sounds incredible on vocals and  drums.  Do yourself a HUGE favor and BUY THIS CD(s)!  You will love it!  If  you don't like it, then you don't know music at all.
B000001Y42|3.0|When I first bought this cd, I was expecting lead singer Fred Durst to be the same hip-hop pimp as he was on the &quot;All in the Family&quot; with KoRn, busting out the phat rhymes over heavy guitar riffs from the other  band members. Instead, this album is more of endless shouting and  screaming, which really isn't all that bad, but if I want to hear Jon  Davis, I'll listen to KoRn. This band is incredibly talented, but if they  want to get off the ground, they should stray away from trying to become  the Deftones and KoRn and venturing into their hip-hop roots, and it looks  like that's the direction they're headed hearing their new single  &quot;Nookie&quot;. <br />Recommended songs: Counterfeit, Stuck, and Faith is  always a good singalong.
B000002AV5|5.0|I bought this CD about a year ago, while visiting Quebec. I didin' know who Sade was, but it didn't matter because I was willing to pay $15 just to have her picture. When I first played her album my life changed forever.  Just Kidding, however I was in love; not only was Sade beautiful but she  had the most amazing voice I have ever heard. Because of this &quot;Sade  fever&quot; I decided to learn more about her. What I realy wanted to know  was if she was avalable and how I could get a hand on her, if you know what  I mean. That's when I learned that she was in her 40s, and unfortunatly I'm  only 20. So I didn't get to go out with her, but it doesn't matter because  when ever I lisend to her CD its like going on a date with her in a fantasy  world.
B000000IT1|4.0|Great psychedelic, DIY rock symphonies from the Floyd, before the band got huge. UMMAGUMMA's just as great, too. This experimental stuff is great, and other bands like Can, Faust, Magma, Soft Machine, are worth checkin' out  too.
0790731983|4.0|I love the songs and the dancing was excellent.Bob Fosse's lightening was really neat. Unfortunately, The story outline is rather dull. The &quot;Tomorrow Belongs to Me&quot; scene is so freaky! It gave me chills up  my spine. How could anyone be so stupid to actually follow the ***hole  named Hitler? This is a must- see for any Liza Minneli, Joel Grey or  Michael York fan!
B00000J7A2|5.0|CAPTAIN BEEFHEART IS GOD!!!!  This recent reissue is a true gem for all Beefheart fans.  Its bluesy as all hell and gritty as anything you've ever heard.  Different from the Trout Mask Replica days, which came after said  album.  Enjoy kids!!
6302814359|5.0|I viewed this movie when it was first released and have rented it about two-thousand times since.  I love this movie for many reasons.  One is that it is hilarious.  Another reason is that it is also scary.  This movie is  definitely the best from the Return of the Living Dead trilogy.  I wish  that they would make another part to this movie.
B000002JS6|5.0|I grew up listening to AC/DC and I still listen to them, Once you hear one song, or see one video your hooked they make me get up and party everytime I hear an AC/DC song. For a good time I strongly suggest this CD, Along  with other AC/DC CD's
B00000JGHM|5.0|When you have a killer cast like this, how can you go wrong? This movie combines drama, action/adv., and is a heart stopping thriller. De niro and pacino give a great performance and the camera shots and angles are great.  5 stars doesn't even rate how well this movie is made. I would check it out  sometime and see the great actors in this masterpeice!
0061053430|5.0|i am a huge fan of the alien legacy, and this book provides the best factual and detailed information on the CMC than any other.  We all know aliens was the best movie out of the four, and this is a great read for  anyone who enjoys the movies.  I am currently working on an alien 5 script  for 20th century fox, and this will help me enormously in my military  aspect of the story.   Enjoy this great tech manual too!!!
6302206294|1.0|Kevin Costner ruins another movie (not that it wasn't already ruined by the script!).  I think the way his line &quot;We'll find saftey and solace in the trees&quot; came out says it all.  You would think they would have  done another take.
0385493800|4.0|Although not as compelling as most of Johns books, this one caught my attention from the beginning and kept me hooked throughout.  My favorites are still &quot;The Chamber&quot; and &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;.  This  story lacks the  luster found in those two novels, but is very worthy and  worth buying.  I enjoyed it immensly and would recommend it to anyone.
B00000JCB2|1.0|The first one stunk and so does this! Udder failur
B00000IOSU|5.0|I'm not the only one who loves Sarah's music, nor can I praise her work any better than already has been done. For those of us who were fortunate enough to see her Surfacing tour last year, to hear the live tracks brings  back wonderful memories. Unlike most artists, when you hear Sarah sing  live, emotions and feelings come through her voice that don't in the  studio. &quot;Building a Mystery,&quot; and &quot;Path of Thorns,&quot;  especially. The live track of &quot;Ice Cream&quot; is the best treat,  though. A favorite of mine, the audience sing along gives me chills every  time.
B00000IO4J|5.0|This Film has to be the Funniest Horror film In years. I admit I hated Scream but this is Classic. The References to other classics was superbly executed. Everyone who owns a VCR must watch It.
B000002JS6|5.0|the best thing about ac/dc is they have been around for 20+ years and they still keep rocking them out. not very many bands can brag on that accomplishment. best band ever, bar-none!
B000000993|5.0|Great album, consistant, flowing, and diabolical.  This album is better that aenima on repeated listen.  Prison sex, bottom, and disgustipated anchor the album.  Sober is a classic.  Maynard James Keenan is an absolute  demon and his vocals are amazing, and Danny Carey is a revelation on drums.  This is Tool's best album.
0451169514|5.0|I have read IT and seen the movie version of it and I have to say both gave me the creeps espically PENNYWISE who or what he is I'm not going to say and do all of the people aware of his existence survive I won't say but  it will keep you up at night that's for sure. This book is definatley one  of STEPHEN KING'S finest all in all don't miss IT.
0140434267|5.0|This book was very fun to read! The dialect was puzzling in places, but it was so different from some of the twentieth-century authors who write with slang and no culture at all. Jane Austen created a tale that is very sweet,  very smart, and very imaginative. I love the characters Elizabeth and Jane  Bennet with their witcisms and mistakes and exclamaitions. I would  recommend this book to anyone, even my sister who doesn't read books.
630440607X|5.0|I saw ROBIN HOOD PRINCE OF THIEVES and I hve to say it was great and here's why. Even though I agree with a lot of people that KEVIN COSTNER was miscast in the lead role. I felt overall that the rest of the cast such as  ALAN RICKMAN, MORGAN FREEMAN and MARY ELIZABETH MASTRANTONIO were more than  great in thier roles and it made up for the above. Does ROBIN HOOD and his  men triumph or does the dastardly SHERRIFF OF KNOTTINGHAM get his way I  won't say just watch and find out So I would definatley recommend ROBIN  HOOD PRINCE OF THIEVES  it's a blast!
B00000J7J4|5.0|I hadn't heard any of Santana's work until now, but I love it! I bought the album for the song &quot;Smooth&quot; because I love Rob Thomas's voice.  I think the song is definately one of the best on the entire album!   Santana is one of the most amazing guitar players in the world. In fact, I  love the songs without vocals as much or more then i do the ones with  vocals.  This is an incredible c.d., and I recommend you buy it  immediately!
B00000IO4J|4.0|I was pretty impressed by the story line and the whole time I was glued to the screen not wanting to miss a secon of it. The cast had good chemistry and the acting was pretty impresive as well for actors in that age group. I  strongly suggest you watch this movie if your feeling let down  by the  substandard movie like Disturbing behavior and urban legend. Noteworthy  performance by the actors who played Stokely, Zeke and Stan. John Stewart  had anice little role in the movie as well.
B00000IOSU|5.0|It's been a long time since I've just sat and listened to a new album without doing anything else, like reading or web surfing.  I just listened to this one in its entiretly without doing anything, and it was wonderful!   I have all Sarah's other albums, so none of the songs were unknown to me,  but these performances were great, mostly better than the originals.
B00000J7J4|5.0|Having terminated his contractual obligations at Columbia Records, Carlos's first outing at Arista is brilliant. Supernatural is a well thought out and carefully put together album. His guest stars add great  diversity and fun to the music whilst still maintaining that magical Carlos  touch.....!!<br />Artists and tracks of note, include: Everlast, Dave  Matthews, Eagle-Eye Cherry, Mana and last but not least, Eric Clapton.<br />Thank you Carlos. We look forward to the next 20 years......!!
630398021X|5.0|Strange Days is an excellent example of using film to tell a story given the high-caliber actors (Ralph Fiennes, Angela Bassett, Tom Sizemore and Juliette Lewis) and the realistic/futuristic production design (LA 1999).  Everyone I've recommended this movie to has enjoyed it!  The story of a  lovesick ex-cop, turned virtual-reality junkie and civil rights advocate is  a delightful &quot;what if&quot; scenario.  Also, I'm not surprised that  James Cameron's production company is involved, I'd have to say that he is  the &quot;King of the &quot;What If&quot; scenario!&quot;  (For instance,  &quot;What if&quot; In order to change the future, a robot is sent back in  time to kill a specific person.(The Terminator)) It is unfortunate that  this movie wasn't promoted more and I feel lucky that I came upon this  movie accidently on HBO.  Although I am a fan of thrillers and sci-fi, a  good story (giving the viewer a range of feelings and emotions) regardless  of the genre is what truly sells to a wide audience.  I believe that  Strange Days is a good story told extremely well by the director, Kate  Bigelow, using film.
B00000J7J4|5.0|At last!!!!!!! Some good music. This cd is amazing. There's only one thing I dont know about... what's up with the Santana and Rob Thomas duo??? Their music is totally different and i dont think Thomas voice is the best for  that song. &quot;Smooth&quot; is awesome. Santana is not dead.!!!VIVA  SANTANA!!!
B000002H8F|4.0|This album is not my favorite &quot;album&quot; of the Pixies, because I think &quot;Doolittle&quot; and &quot;Trompe Le Monde&quot; are albums you can listen straight through and savour every song. &quot;Bossanova&quot;  has some of the Pixies greatest songs on it, in my opinion, songs like -  &quot;Cecilia Ann&quot;, &quot;Rock Music&quot;, &quot;Velouria&quot;,  &quot;Allison&quot;, &quot;Is She Weird?&quot;, &quot;Ana&quot;, &quot;All  Over The World&quot;, &quot;Dig For Fire&quot;, and &quot;Hang Wire&quot;.  But everything else, all five songs, just aren't up to snuff, compared to,  really, the first half of the album. But even the Pixies &quot;filler&quot;  is great compared to Matchbox 20, Semisonic, Sugar Ray, Smash Mouth, blah  blah blah you know the rest. &quot;Bossanova&quot; is still one great  album.
0385484518|4.0|A fine piece to bring out the tears at all the right places. Beatiful and sugary. The big question for me, that Mitchell does not address, is whether he went to see Morrie, after seing the Ted Koppel interview, because he  cared and felt guilty with Morrie, or because he smelled the business  opportunity of writing a book. I would love to know. Regards from Puerto  Rico.
B000002LUB|3.0|People either love or hate this album. I'm somewhere in the middle. It's not bad but it won't make anyone forget Paranoid or Heaven And Hell. If you're a die-hard Sabbath fan it's definitely worth pickng up.
0688170528|5.0|When a friend lent this book to me I put off reading it for a couple weeks.  Once I finally picked it up I couldn't put it down!!  I read it in two days and couldn't think about anything else when I wasn't reading it.   I was worried about how it would end, but it was WONDERFUL!  I can't wait  to read Jodi Picoult's other novels!!  This book comes highly  recommended...read it!
6304836619|4.0|The film is brilliant -- sets, acting, script are all superb.  It's interesting, intelligent, visually beautiful, and creates genuine tension.  How wonderful -- a thriller without gore!<br />The DVD is done on the cheap.   No bonus materials.  The opening credits -- despite this being a  'widescreen' edition -- run off the sides of the screen.  The 'matting' is  uneven: the black strip below the picture on the screen is thicker on the  left side than on the right.  And, oddly (because it's over 2 hours long?),  you have to turn the DVD over midway through.<br />Glad this wonderful title  is available, but a big slap on the wrist to the cheap producer and the  sloppy engineer.
0451198670|2.0|I had heard rave reviews about the upcoming movie, so I decided to read the book.  I had a very hard time getting interested in Helen's constant I-can-do-no-wrong attitude.  She's so self-centered!  I found myself  skimming the pages rather than reading them.  The last 100 pages were a bit  more interesting and I actually finished the book.  This book isn't as good  as it sounds...until you get towards the end.
0792833686|5.0|Buy extra copies of this wonderful DVD to give to friends, it's funny, beautiful, touching, and the dancing can make even guys with two left feet want to dance.<br />One distressing moment: in the supreme 'pas de deux' dance  sequence (where she has a 20-foot white veil), there's a break in the film  at a crucial moment.  Very disconcerting.  Couldn't they find an unbroken  original to work from??<br />But it gets 5 stars anyway!!  Enjoy!
B00000IFWE|5.0|This is perhaps the best TP &amp; the Heartbreakers album yet, certainly the best in the 90's. There isn't a weak song on this disc -- sad songs, hopeful songs, amusing songs, great songs. Certainly a more mellow Petty album than any other, but the masterful keyboards (particularly the organ),gritty guitar playing, and thoughtful vocals make these 60+ minutes of music a complete pleasure.
B00000IMCW|5.0|This is the Best movie ever made, and to all the people who said it sucked, you need help, crack addiction is a disease, go to the hospital now.
B000002GBD|5.0|Nazareth is a supreme hard rock legend, and Hair Of The Dog is arguably one of the band's best &amp; most creative musical efforts!  A &quot;Must Listen&quot; album, for sure!
B00000ILBK|4.0|At last, after the previous 2 ST:TNG movie outings, a really good character based film. The plot is, OK, standard Star trek fare, but at least it does not resort to banal, not to mention  totally illogical, time  travel twists. I was so disappointed with Generations and First Contact  because they refused to give the audience any credit for some common sense.  The story line in this film does not stretch our credulity, and allows all  the actors to shine.<br />Indeed it is so refereshing to see the characters  have their grand scenes ( though some what annoying to still see that  Picard is not allowed to have a true romance, his kissing scenes were cut  ), and also to see broad but believable comedy in a Star trek film. I was  laughing out loud many times.....<br />The film is most reminscent of The  Undiscovered Country in the way that it allows the plot to create  characters that we believe in. It makes for good heroes and remarkable  villains ( F. Murray Abraham is superb ). Ok some of the make-ups are a  little phoney, I am still not sure of the plastic surgery styling, and some  of the CGI effects are  a little computer game-ish, and I am still not too  sure if I like the new Enterprise, but overall this is now one of my  favourite Star Trek movies.
B000001F29|5.0|One of the best new age albums eve
0553573403|5.0|This book is an excellent new beginning.  I haven't had this much fun since I read &quot;Eye of the World&quot;.  I'd forgotten how much fun reading the beginning of an all-new series could be, a series full of all  new characters and plots.  If you are looking for a book where you have a  hero that gets in trouble and at the last minute results to a splendid  magical episode to get him out this is not it.  This is a story where the  good guys sometimes lose and they must rely on brain and brawn, not might  and magic.  Martin brings the Seven Kingdoms to life with a gifted talent  of the English language.  My only hope is that Martin continues to dazzle  us with this epic and doesn't fall back to just putting out books to keep  the series going.  We are getting far to much of that today.  Get this  book...you will not be disappointed.
B000002L82|4.0|Power, Corruption, and Lies to me is the actual album that seperates NewOrder from Joy Division. During the album Movement it seems the band still wasn't sure what route they wanted to go with their music. This album  is where they &quot;defined&quot; a sound, and a new band. An album that  was inspired by Kraftwerk, and the need for something new. From Blue  Monday, to Your Silent Face, PCL merged  electronic music with some of the  deepest heart-felt lyrics. An album that definately stands the test of  time.
B00000273P|5.0|I was first introduced to Prefab Sprout in college. Frankly, my taste in music has never been the same. I was never one for truly listening to the lyrics of songs. I always thought they were dull and somewhat boring.  Prefab Sprout has turned this around. Prefab Sprout approach to music is  interesting and definitely unique. I have found only one other ablum to  come as close to Jordan: The Comeback that is Tears For Fears last ablum.  Listen  to the sounds of Prefab Sprout and you'll never be the same. You'll  think of Prefab Sprout with this dreamy smile on your face and hum tunes  like &quot;Jesse James Bolero&quot;. And think WOW!- a little of heaven on  earth.
B000002KDG|5.0|If I had to own only one Neil Young album, this would be it.  It has everything one could want on it:  hard rock, acoustic ballads, folk.  Young seems to have reached his creative peak with this album, though some of his  later recordings have shown some promise.
B00000IQV1|5.0|I love this movie, it makes you laugh and cry and I think Hunter &quot;Patch&quot; Adams from what I can see is an extraordinarty person.  My idea of heaven is a place where everyone had his attitude.  The whole  movie is full of laughs and a few tears, which if it was only laughs then  it wouldn't be a true life story, would it?  I can not for the life of me  understand how anyone could speak poorly of this movie, just goes to prove  you cant please everyone.  I cant imagine more than 1% of the movie goers  or less not loving the movie.
B000002L5I|5.0|Give him time and he will adopt a theme and style all of his own The CD is one of the best Blues albums of 99'
B00000J6AG|5.0|This CD is the bomb! Don't believe the nay-sayers about this album, I've had it for 3 days and can't stop listening to it.<br />Moby once again smashes preconceived notions about what his music &quot;should&quot; sound like,  and busts a move into early blues / folk tunes, smacking some phat flavor  into them with techno / punk sensibilites. <br />A great album!
B00000J7J4|5.0|Carlos does more than talk about the transcending power of music--he shows it!  This record covers the four corners of the globe, and the deepest chambers of the heart.  Yet, it still touches the listener--no matter what  language or lack thereof.  If you are already familiar with Santana's  center of being guitar sound, this record is a must.  If not, same deal  goes.
B00000BKDW|5.0|What can I say. This album rocks! Arguably one of their top 3 albums if not the best. All the songs carry the sense of power that the name of the album entails. Driving chords and thumping drums really get your blood  pounding. &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; is amazing. Definately  should be regarded as a great rock'n roll epic. The music and the story are  great. Iron Maiden, I think, gets unfairly lumped in with the &quot;80's  Heavy Metal&quot; bands. The were far more talented then any of their  contemporaries in my opinion. Thoughtful lyrics, powerful music, and Eddie  all mixed into one the best bands in the last twenty years. I wish they  could get more recognition for their music and their talent. Iron Maiden  ROCKS!
B00000IOSU|5.0|Sarah Mclachlan is what you would call a true artist.  She sounds as good live as she does in her studio albums.  Jewel is one of the only other artist who I can think of that sounds just as good live as on her cds.   Sarah is a great singer  and her voice really shines through on this cd.   It is incredible.  If you are a Sarah fan you'll love this cd.
0385493800|4.0|This is a story about a lawyer who has hit rock bottom.  He is in a rehab center and seemingly at the bottom of the barrel.  He is resurrected by another lawyer in the firm, when he offers him the chance ot travel to the  jungle of Brazil and locate the missing heir.  Troy Phelan, a billionaire   jumps to his death with his children in attendance.  He has totally  disinherited all of his children with the exception of his illegitimate  daughter, whom he has not seen in years.  Nate, is given the opportunity to  travel to the jungle and find the heir and give her the tremendous fortune  of Phelan.  After a trek through the jungle, storms, snakes, dengue (which  was near fatal) and a spiritual experience, Nate returns to the United  States.  This is one of the best books I have read by Grisham and it seems  that he has encountered a religious experience. )  The book was well  researched and one can feel the mosquito bites as you travel on the  Pantanal.
B000007MVZ|5.0|A Pagan Place is an album brimming with joy, passion and spirituality.  The lyrics and music are brilliant.  The band is in top form and you can tell they really believe in the songs they're singing.  The first time I  heard this album (especially the song A Pagan Place) it left me literally  shaking with emotion.  Red Army Blues is a tragic song about a Russian  soldier with an indominatable will to survive.  Church Not Made with Hands  is one of the most joyous songs I have ever heard.  If you want to  experience a brilliant musical experience, I highly recommend this album.
0345423496|5.0|Arthur C., one of the greatest minds of all time, manages to outdue himself with this literary jewel.  He takes a plausible, optomistic view of our future and lets you enter that universe.
B000002MJC|5.0|SOFAD is by far the edgiest and srongest Depeche Mode album to date. This shows a mature, complex and talented band both in music and lyrics and is far superior to any other album they have released. A must-have album for  all Depeche Mode fans and all music fans in general. If you did not like  Depeche Mode before SOFAD, you will surely be a fan after listening to this  album!
014028009X|5.0|I read this book due to all the hype surrounding it.  Initially, I was a bit thrown off due to the structure of it, but you immediatly begin to catch on. This is the funniest book I have read to date.  I think its due  to the fact that I have been single and happen to be a woman.  I love the  little side notes that really make this book a pleasure to read.  If your  looking for something light and fun, order this book - you'll enjoy it!
0553108034|4.0|This follow up to The Game of Thrones does well in its attempts to keep the reading truly engrossing.  While their is a slight fall off in the story, I was kept enthralled by the elaborate world and its  many  characters.  All the characters are faulted to a degree, and each moves  within their own personal motives and sense of righteousness.  While some  of the scenes are a bit harsh and crude, I believe it would have difficult  to developed the characters nature without the often raw and crass script.   Prehaps Martin could have made some adjustments to appeal to a wider base  of readers, but he took a chance and decided to provide a no holds bared  look at a corrupt world and its often corrupt characters.   I am eager to  read the next installment.
6305358613|4.0|I found the film to be consistent and wonderfully written.  I agree that there are some historical discrepancies in the film, but one is so caught up in the emotion of the film, that it is hard to differentiate fact from  fiction.  If one compares this film to an opera by Donizetti, author of  &quot;Anna Bolena&quot;, this film had some really fine historical  qualities. These historical events may not have occurred exactly as  portrayed in the film, but these discrepancies only serve as an enhancement  to the entertainment value of the film itself.       I felt the film was of  the highest caliber and would certainly recommend it to anyone who is a fan  of the Elizabethan era.
6305268177|5.0|Highly recommended, especially if you want to recall good times of Grease, Saturday's Night Fever and a lot of oldies. Top-notch video and audio complete the impressive performance.
B0000024SI|5.0|1) Queen Jane Approximately and Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues:  incredible companion pieces to Like A Rolling Stone that nearly are nearly equal to it.  An innovative sound in rock that nobody, including Dylan himself,  never really recaptured. 2) Desolation Row:  They're selling postcards of  the hanging/they're painting the passports brown/the beauty parlor is  filled with sailors/the circus is in town X 20. 3) Mike Bloomfield:  An  extraordinarily talented and currently overlooked blues guitarist.  As Al  Kooper put it, &quot;I never heard a white man play guitar like that  before, and that was the end of my guitar career right there&quot;.  Sorry  but Robbie Robertson can't match up. 4)  No &quot;Sooner or Later&quot;:   An overdone song any way you cut it, it doesn't belong on Blonde on Blonde  and is a thorn in its side.   5) Like A Rolling Stone:  The seminal rock  and roll song, one of the most instantly recognizable choruses in music.   The influential song of the sixties, and it's why we were overrun with  bands like the Animals rather than jerks like Donovan.  Hey, you take your  pick.
0844663662|4.0|Another extremely funny anti-war novel on the lines of Catch 22,  but not quite as good.  Billy Pilgrim driven mad by his experiences of war travels in  time and between worlds.  This book wouid have had a greater impact had   Vonnegut described  in more detail the horrors of the Dresden bombing,  which he witnessed first hand.
155890641X|5.0|This is one of the most groundbreaking movies of all time!  It's great not just because it was the first full-length animated feature, but because of how human the characters actually are.  When Walt Disney was making this at  the time, all of Hollywood was labeling it as &quot;Disney's Folly&quot;.   Well, here we are today, with all those companies who once thought it would  fail starting to make their own animated movies.  &quot;Snow White and the  Seven Dwarfs&quot; will always remain a masterpiece because of it's  whimsical animation, convincing characters, and being the first movie of  its kind.  This is definitely one movie that is worthwile to own.
0784010501|5.0|I watched this straight throught twice to catch every word--and I rarely watch any movie twice, let alone back to back viewings. Madonna is smart, savvy, talented, and hard working. I wish I'd known how much she puts into  her shows, because after seeing this I would love have to seen her blond  ambition tour. Unlike other rock stars who are just dragged from a limo and  poured on the stage for their sets, then leave, Madonna puts on a full  scale performance, with lights, costumes, drama, and great singing. The  physical and emotional stress of doing this on a world tour, is evident  from this movie. Madonna shows many facets--her vulnerability, her having  to be tough, the respect she commands as a star and the lack of respect she  gets because she's a woman--there's nobody like her. The family visits are  interesting, and best of all, Warren Beatty, like a aging vampire shrinking  from the lights, hanging around complaining and sparring with Madonna. This  is simply fascinating, and I really admire Madonna now.
0140011749|5.0|What ho! This jolly book contains more tales of Bertie Wooster, a goodish chap, really, but a bit of a chump. When he finds himself in the soup, his man Jeeves, a brainy cove, always sets him right again. The final story is  a real corker, told by Jeeves himself! He's really a bit of a rotter, don't  you know, but makes for a dashed good read.
6304936362|4.0|The reviewer here is graying son of a father who flew 27-missions as crew on a B17F out'a Parham, England c1943.  (The Belle is an &quot;F&quot; in this same timeframe.)  Like other reviwers I understand that at best the  plot roughly matches events surrounding the first crew to finich their 25  missions.  Yet the real import to me is how accurately the settings,  interactions, and 'feel' matches everything my Dad ever said about his  experiences.  Including the frigid clear-blue calm instantly punctuated by  sheer-terror only to retun moments later to serenity with no hint of the  mayhem of moments earlier except for the holes in the ship, spent  50-caliber rounds, and the wounded.  The dialog, the on-the-ground stand-by  and in-flight routine all rang true.  And I really finally understood that  look in his eye to the enevitable phrase on the out-bound leg of each  flight, &quot;Sir, that's the Third Reich down there.&quot;
B000003S2K|5.0|I've had this for years and actually heard it being played in the tunnel between concourses in the United area of O'Hare just after the new area opened.<br />Great background for a massage.
B000002H6C|4.0|What a way for bassist Jason Newsted to break in. Some might not know, but Newsted did appear on &quot;Garage Days Re-Revisited befroe this album. Anyway, &quot;Justice&quot; is just that. 9 songs and over a hour of very  creative bone-crunching music, Hetfield and the boys just went intothe  studio and made it happen. &quot;Blackened&quot; is a great opening track  very aggressive and to the point. &quot;And Justice for All&quot; at over  nine minutes described the dysfunctios of the legal system well before O.J.  The classic &quot;One&quot; how can someone describe it? Wow? My personal  favorite and again almost 10 minutes in length &quot;To live is to  Die&quot; the last written song by the late Cliff Burton contained only one  verse. Without giving it away, the listener's take on deception will  change. This was the last Metallica album with that rough sound and the  last one produced by Fleming Rasmussen before that awful Bob Rock. A must  have for any fan of metal.
6302759110|5.0|This movie is a great movie with cool special effects, good acting, a solid storyline, and just enough action to keep everyone interested. Gary Oldman does a great job a playing the diabolical, elusive fiend Dracula.  The first 10 minutes is really good for setting the scene for the rest of  the movie, and the movie is great to watch, with friends, your girlfriend  (or boyfriend), or even just by yourself. Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins,  and yes, even Keanu Reeves give great performances. So if you want to rent  a great movie that is both a horror movie and a romance, look no further  than Bram Stoker's Dracula.
B00000016O|5.0|I gets chills when I listen to this album years later. The title track is one of the greatest songs ever recorded. And The Last Resort isn't far behind. A must for everyone's all time best lists.
0375707972|5.0|This isn't just a book to read. It's a book to feel. To respond to and then explore those responses. To me it wasn't just about the Holocaust or Hanna and Michael. It's about the deepest levels of human emotions and  psychology. How we behave in difficult circumstances -- circumstances as  horrible as the Holocaust and as basic as whether to intrude in another  person's life. Its spare writing (and I assume strict editing by both the  author and editor) focuses on events and feelings and a deep exploration  and understanding of both. I will read it again. And I wish it had been  there to read when I was in college -- although I probably would not have  understood it as well. I can't criticize those who didn't like it. But  we'll never have anything is common!
B0000070QS|5.0|Known to the most of the world as a member of a-ha, Morten Harket did his first solo album. Sounds different that works with group - more ballads, less rock. But - believe me - it sounds just wonderful with Morten'  incredible voice and music culture and talent. Great, great, great! I'm  waiting unpatiently for second shot...
0800130936|5.0|I love &quot;Bad Boys&quot; in everyway no matter how many times that I have seen it (on DVD/movies/cable). The same day that I bought the DVD, I watch it twice, in English and French.  One of the reasons that I love this  movie is the acting of these two talented gentlemen, Lawrence and Smith.  The strong languages used during the whole movie were no matter to me.   They are what make the movie so funny.  This movie is for adults anyways.   The action of this movie is something that we should not miss either.  I  loved the foot chase a lot.  I also have to give credits to the two  beautiful women, Tea and Theresa.  Where do these angels come from? No  other features come with the DVD besides Languages, Audio, and Scnenes  selections.
6301976983|5.0|Bogarts performance in this film is breathtaking. It is truly amazing to see this artisan weave the life and character of Fred C. Dobbs. While the film dragged in parts, Bogart shows how a peaceful caring man can become  overwrought with greed and paranoia. AMAZING.

6300214370|5.0|This movie makes a great point about the supression of ideas and thought and how harmful that can be to adolescents.  Besides, the movie is a great 80's flick and has an awesome soundtrack--definately one of my favorites!
B00000IOSU|5.0|Aside from a few TV appearances I had never heard Sarah McLachlan perform live. I don't generally even care for live albums, but this is definitely one major exception to that rule. She has an incredible voice, and she  knows how to use it to accentuate every nuance of her equally incredible  songs. &quot;Hold On&quot; was new to me, and this performance of  &quot;Good Enough&quot; caught my attention where I'd overlooked the radio  version. There isn't a song on this CD that I didn't end up liking, and  even listening to her perform favorites is a new experience. You won't be  disappointed with this album.
6305364648|5.0|I'm a great fan of Schwarzenegger. True Lies is not only great but the High Tech used in this movie is incredible.  Great casts too.  You should buy the DVD format of this movie.  The sound qualtity is 'Da Bumb'.  Great  feature design.  You'll enjoy this movie form the beginning 'til the end.
6302482585|5.0|Casablanca is undoubtedly the greatest film to ever grace the screen. This intriguing story and touching yet star crossed love saga is often masked in the standards it set. Everyone has heard &quot;heres lookin at you  kid&quot; or this is the start of a beautiful friendship but if the viewer  only takes these phrases, that person has missed out on a lot more. The  amazing performance by Bogart as a sarcastic yet hopeless romantic is  simply spectacular and the entire cast makes up a motley crew of characters  that makes Casablanca intriguing at every viewing. It is boldly shown why  &quot;everyone comes to Rick's&quot;
1573300403|5.0|I think this is one of the all time best albums that Michael has done. I have the CD and was so glad to see it on DVD. What a difference being able to watch him do those great songs. I wish they could have done all the  songs off the CD, but better most, then none. Whether you love him or not,  you have got to admit that the boy has talent. I am hoping that they decide  to release other albums he has done on DVD. If you do not already have this  ... what are you waiting for?
0780622553|5.0|This is an awesome movie!!! I knew l'd like it just from the ads. It's sci-fi at it's best and it was just made to be seen on DVD. It had Rufus Sewell and Ian Richardson (one of my all time fave actors), l had  reservations about the acting skills of Kiefer Sutherland, but l was  pleasantly suprised. He does a pretty good job. The special effects remind  me of &quot;Spawn&quot; and yes..The Matrix is similar, maybe it's why l  loved them both.
6303122647|2.0|I agree with the viewer of New York, the movie's problem is, that it's to violent (I don't mean like they use guns or has nudity), I'm trying to say is that poeple saw the movie because they though it was a kick ass movie,  (that was shown on the preview)but then the theater showed the movie and I  took my 4 year old brother(now 10)  to see the movie that the new york  times called &quot;A Tim Burton's Masterpiece&quot; turn out to be a kind  of sick movie for young kids, after the movie my brother never wanted to  see this bloody movie again, so guys, if you want to see a really cool  musical just watch Grease instead.
630407185X|5.0|This is one of my favorite war movies. An all star international cast that tells the story of Operation Market Garden. A must see in the widescreen mode if you can find it. Although Gene Hackman does overdo it a bit.
0425107469|5.0|This was the second book by dean koontz that I have read and it is quite possibly one of the best books ever written. The way dean koontz describes his scenes evinces he spends plenty of time researching his books. The plot  and the inner plots were fantastic. I reccommend this book to anybody who  can read.

0446673749|5.0|Right from the beginning, you are hooked into this story. Who is the good guy? Who is the bad guy? Just when you think you have it figured out, something else comes along to make you reconsider. Yes, the characters are  a bit larger than life, but that just adds to the fun. I don't know or care  whether the technical info is correct - the story line is terrific!
0767811038|2.0|The rest of the movie needed some help. By all means READ THE BOOK. It is much deeper and tells a more involved story. You also get to read about the Skinnies. I happened to read the book before seeing the movie and there is  no comparison. Skip this film and READ !
B000009QPE|5.0|I don't give much five stars, but this one definitely gets it, with South of Heaven coming in at 4 1/2 behind it.  When I first popped this into my player, I was hooked.  From the getgo, Slayer take hold of your throat and  never loosen their grip, right from &quot;Angel of Death&quot; all the way  through &quot;Jesus Saves&quot;, when they take their first breather.  Then  it's full speed ahead again until the evil and sinister &quot;Raining  Blood&quot;, where they stop for air again.  28 minutes of pure rifftastic  fury from a great band, and they never let up once.  This album will NEVER  be matched, it's historic and in just one word...Awesome.
B000002BFL|5.0|When Bruce realeased &quot;Born in the USA,&quot; consciously or not, he had created the musical tapestry for the conservative restoration the began its ascent in the Reagan years.  With &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad,&quot;  Bruce leaves no doubt about his leftist political inclinations.  Through  imagery borrowed from John Steinbeck, he accoustically rips apart the  mean-spirited trends in California (e.g.-Prop. 187) and U.S. politics by  serving up an inspired and emotional rendering of everyday life for working  folks in the new &quot;global&quot; economy.  Songs such as  &quot;Youngstown&quot; speak to the feelings of those left behind by  corporations with no sense of loyalty to place or community.  With this  bold, progressivist stance, it is no suprise that reviews of this album are  polarized.  My guess is that Bruce is happy with this result.  He has  separated the &quot;wheat from the chaffe&quot; by spiritually uplifting  the real Springsteen fans, those who are all about aligning themselves with  the working- and under-classes of society, and challenging those so-called  &quot;fans&quot; who aspire to a &quot;winner-takes-all&quot; political  ideology.  In sum, this is one of the best album I have ever heard by an  white, American male artist who is so closely associated with U.S. pop  culture.

B000001C6M|3.0|First of all, to the guy who said Lombardo was Slayer...I hate people like you.  Morons like you shouldn't be allowed to be fans of Slayer.  Slayer are a BAND, no one member possesses all of the cards, and let me tell you,  if you don't own the killer Divine Intervention, proof that Lombardo wasn't  the band, that I suggest you should.  I don't recall Lombardo writing any  sprawling riffs, and while he was a great drummer, he was by no means the  band.  Plus Bostaph rules too.<br />But back to the point at hand...This album  is by no means phenomenal, but really a blueprint for what was to come from  Slayer.  While not overly original, sinister, or thrashy, it was a more  melodic Slayer, more influence from Maiden and Priest than their thrash  predessors.  Check out &quot;The Anti-Christ&quot;, &quot;Evil Has no  Boundaries&quot;, and &quot;Metal STorm/Face the Slayer&quot; for some  great tracks...but beware...their better material was to follow!
B00000IOSU|5.0|Sarah McLachlan not only has touching music, but her lyrics shine.  This is a great album, but it's only a compilation.  I would suggest buying the rest of her stuff first to see how powerful her songs are in their original  form.
B00000JCRH|5.0|Master of Puppets was the first Metallica album that I heard, and I must admit that I was knocked on my a** by the pure aggression of it all.  Not only is it aggressive, it also combined some pretty cool melodies between  James and Kirk.  My favorite tune is Disposable Heroes, followed closely by  Orion.  James' rhythm guitar is just awesome on the whole album.  I  recommend this to anyone who wants to hear the best heavy metal album of  all time.
B000009QPG|3.0|This album is full of recycled, tired, and overused riffs, and vocally is about as boring as you get.  While tunes like &quot;War Ensemble&quot;, &quot;Dead Skin Mask&quot;, &quot;Hallowed Point&quot;, the title track,  and &quot;Born of Fire&quot; seriously rock, several of the songs sound  like outtakes and not thought out, especially like &quot;Expendable  Youth&quot; and &quot;Blood Red&quot;, two almost identical songs which  remind me of the Stones on steroids.  Overall, this album was a severe  let-down after the masterpiece South of Heaven, which is legions better.   This, in my opinion, is Slayer's worst album, and while it's decent, it is  nowhere near along the lines of Reign, South, Divine, or Hell...I don't  recommend this one for a new Slayer fan.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Going Away to College is the best song ever fricking written
068815333X|4.0|This is the first novel I read by Lehane, and I've since read two others.  Although I believe &quot;Darkness, Take My Hand&quot; was a superior book, this one cannot be overlooked as an example of what I call for lack of a  better term &quot;hard-core&quot; detective fiction. Reviews I've seen that  are down on Lehane's writing claim that his books teach us that it is  acceptable for the good guys to resort to extreme violence to get  information they need.  What &quot;good guys&quot;?  Kenzie is just a guy  whose perspective we get the story from.  If you want fluffy solutions to  problems read Lawrence Sanders.  If you want a protagonist every bit as  gutsy and complicated as Block's Matt Scudder, read any books by Dennis  Lehane.
B000002HMH|1.0|I loved metallica before, the guitar, the singing everything and the live shows. While the load tour still rocked mostly due to them playing more old then new songs you know its over when Faith No More's Album of the year is  more metal than metallica.<br />Its too bad because these guys were my heros  growing up. Now they are what they used to make fun of.
B000002B7Y|4.0|I listened to the samples of the songs for &quot;Ultimate Sin&quot; on real audio and I have to tell you this album rocks and I decided I had to buy it! There are no slow songs which makes it better! This music is Great  for exercising or working out!
0684867621|4.0|This story stayed with me long after I finished reading it.  The scenes portrayed by King were so real to me I could almost believe I'd been there.  Of course it helps that I am an avid baseball fan and have watched and  admired the players, especially the pitchers, of that game for many years.  I know some of SK's fans will not enjoy this one because it lacks the far  out horror of some of his books, but I have always thought that the  scariest things come from within the brain and not walking around for  everyone to see.  A great story of strength and endurance.
6300183211|5.0|Scarface is a great movie! Pacino at his best.This is one of his best roles along with Scent of a Woman and the Godfather movies! If you are a Pacino fan, you can't ignore this film.The movie is 2 hrs and 50 minutes  but it seems short because it is so dam entertaining! However, there are  scenes that are shown on broadcast TV that are not included in the VHS  version like the scene where Montana is trying to call his sister on the  telephone and another where he and and Steven Bauer watch a old Humphrey  Bogart flick. This puzzles me
B00000J7JO|3.0|The CD starts off with a great change of tempo song (Around the World), but somewhat lets the fans down afterwards. I hoped that &quot;Scar Tissue&quot; was only a warm-up (but cute) radio single. Not the case!!!  &quot;Californication&quot; has one great line--&quot;Pay your surgeon very  well to break the spell of aging&quot;. Good CD. &quot; ONE HOT MINUTE  &quot; was better.
0800132335|4.0|But the Director's Cut is too self-indulgent.  Its interesting, in the characters that are developed that are left more bland in the studio cut.  However for me, I saw for the first time how a studio can add value, and  sharpen the message more succinctly, than allowing the Director's their  head.  The studio cut is better, but both are fabulous, intense, emotional,  frightening, masterful films.

B00000269G|5.0|&quot;Concert by the Sea&quot; is one of the best jazz albums of all time.  The intensity and creativity of Errol Garner is breathtaking - an album that would have been worthy of either Oscar Peterson or Art Tatum.  The  highest praise I could give this album is that it was years after I bought  this album that I realized that only three musicians were performing!  This  album is a must for both the serious and casual listener of jazz.

0792156684|5.0|I have seen Titanic twice in theatres and countless times at home.  I guess I am a hopeless romantic, but I thought it was so much better than the more &quot;realistic&quot; dramas of today that leave the viewer with a  sick feeling at the end.  I am too young to have seen the movies of the  30's and 40's anywhere but on tv, but I admire the &quot;escapist&quot;  tone of those old love stories and the &quot;clean&quot; violence of the  action films.  I think we could use a few more movies like Titanic and a  few less of the blood and gore.
0784010188|5.0|One of the best movies in the world. No Love, No Kissing and No girly stuff, pure violence<br />and a lot of Arnold Schwarzenegger !
B000009PNY|3.0|This cd is highly dis-jointed. It has some fantastic covers (Rabbit In The Moon's &quot;Waiting For The Night&quot; and Hooverphonic's &quot;Shake The Disease&quot;) but on the other hand, it has some huge blunders as well  (Apollo 440's &quot;I Feel You&quot; and Rammsteins &quot;Stripped&quot;),  the rest of this is just filler. If you're a diehard Depeche Mode fan, you  might want to steer clear, if you just like some of Depeche Mode's songs,  you might want to give this one a try, just to hear other artist's spins on  DM's greatest tracks. Myself, I'll stick with the originals.
B000002I25|5.0|Depending on my mood, it's a toss-up for Best Rock Album of All Time between this one and &quot;Rubber Soul.&quot;  Mostly I lean towards the Doors, because if the Summer of Love (1967, when this album made its debut)  has an anthem, it's &quot;Light My Fire,&quot; which is probably also the  best rock song of all time.  And if you weren't there in '67 when we first  heard the hypnotic clarity of the Krieger and Manzarek instrumentals, and  the visceral scream of Morrison, that's OK, because you can still turn out  all the lights, put on this CD, and be transported anywhere.  Try it,  especially you Gen X-er's, and I promise you'll never go back to the crap  that passes for &quot;music&quot; today.
0448060191|5.0|This book was my favorite as a girl.  I've read it more times than I can count.  It's a joy to pass on my love of this book and this wonderful author to my 10 year old daughter.  This is a book to inspire a love of  classic literature in young women!
B0000024IE|5.0|Nation Of Millions is widely considered the greatest hip-hop album ever, and I won't disagree with that. It was like nothing else we had ever heard both musically and lyrically. But my personal favorit rap album is Fear Of  A Black Planet. Why? It is simply the most focused, intense and powerful  collection on wax. If you don't already own them, buy this album and Nation  Of Millions and feel the revolution.
B00000IP2L|4.0|Wylde's third solo project displays the diversity of his musical interests.  In fact, I am happy this album is not a re-run of his previous work.  Pride and Glory and Book of Shadows showcased his southern  rock/blues talents, but Black Label Society gives the listener an earfull  of his in your face guitar style.  &quot;Grunge&quot; this album is not,  nor is it modern.  Some tracks are psycadellic, while others resemble  material found on his other projects, but if tracks 6, 8, 12, and 14 don't  get you pounding your fist, then you are not alive! While the album has  received mixed reviews, I found it to be an enjoyable listen.  A few tracks  could be skipped over, which is why I give it four stars instead of five,  but overall, Sonic Brew is a must have for any fan of metal or driving rock  n' roll.  Buy It!!!!!!
0792156684|4.0|I had the fortune of seeing Titanic in its opening weeks, before it was a pop culture phenomonen.  I could sit back and take in the movie on its own merit and not burden the film with the overwhelming task of living up to  being the top-grossing film of all time and the movie that tied Ben Hur on  oscar night.  Titanic on its own merit is a wonderful 3 and a half hours.   The romantic sublot says volumes on living in the precious present, and by  the time it has slowly built to the climatic signature shot of Leo and Kate  clinging to the rear of the ship as it lowers into the Atlantic, my breath  was taken away.  I am not especially the romantic type, but I can get into  a movie like this every once and a while, and I have to say that Titanic is  better than most.  Who would have thought that a former truck driver could  be the visionary behind such a romantic masterpiece.<br />The DVD of this film  is an utter dissappointment. As Paramount's biggest video release of recent  memory, Titanic deserves at least the effort that Warner Bros. gave thier  best picture nominee of 1997, LA Confidential.  Offhand I can think of so  many spectacular supplements to this film that could have been included on  this disk, and as much money as Paramount has made off of Titanic one would  think that they could have treated us to the best possible presentation of  thier crown jewel film of the 90's.  Perhaps the Criterion Collection will  favor us with some of the wonderful special edition content that this film  screams for.  In case anyone is listening, may I suggest a few items for  such a release.  First of all, a 16 X 9 presentation would be appreciated  to give us the clearest possible picture and to please those viewers that  have invested in widescreen or high definition TV's.  Frankly, I am suprisd  that a DVD could be THX certified without such a transfer.  Second, I saw a  show on The History Channel that chronicled the historical acuracies of the  film.  I can attest thatgreat pains were taken to ensure that the ship  looked in the film as it really did, but I was most impressed with the keen  resemblances that the actors had to the actual participants in the event.   Perhaps an abbreviated version of this show could be included.  Third, how  about James Cameron's memorable acceptance speech featuring the famous  exclaimation &quot;I'm the king of the world!&quot;  <br />In conclusion I  have to say that I cannot give the DVD release of this movie 5 stars  because Paramount has refrained from giving the movie its due.  I had hoped  that James Cameron could use his freshly renewed clout to ensure that the  DVD of Titanic would be something special as were the DVD releases of  Terminator 2 and Aliens.  A full year after the VHS release of Titanic, my  wait has not been rewarded.
B000002OVJ|5.0|This remaster expands greatly on the original LP.  The sound is INCREDIBLE.  The performance is INCREDIBLE.  The song list is INCREDIBLE.  This is the epitome of live R&amp;R performance.  Marvel at the dynamo that  was Keith Moon.  The guy was an unstoppable force on the drums.  The Who  managed to cover an incredible range of musical textures that few bands  could even contemplate let alone achieve.<br />This is a MUST for any true  Rock &amp; Roll fan.  Get it and see why your currently favorite live  recording is a really bad joke.

It's too bad I was too young when these guys were around, otherwise I would have  loved to see them live.  I can't say much other than this is one of the  best CDs I have, not to mention one of the best ones I've ever heard.
6304602979|5.0|This movie has the greatest fight scene I have ever seen!  No, not the shoot out in the office, but between the girlfriend and the mafia hit man.  If you watch it you'll be hard pressed to remember another fight that comes  close.  While watching it I was pulling my hair out, and after the movie I  was laughing at the hilarity.  Val Kilmer does a great job at Elvis also.   This movie is non-stop action, suprise, and humor.
6300151379|5.0|My eighteen year old daughter, Janice Petrina, first saw this film when aged seven, and desperately, desperately, wishes to own the video.  She knows every word of it off by heart.  Please, please re-release.
0060263857|5.0|Although today I am a 40-something woman.... I still get tears in my eyes whenever I think about the book, Charlotte's Web. This book offers a lesson to all ages. I have a 3 year old daughter, and I can't wait to begin  reading this book to her. When she is able to read on her own, I bet that  she'll choose Charlotte's Web to read again and again, as I once did.
006092988X|5.0|Although I have not finished this novel yet, I believe that it is an excellent novel for young readers.  The novel describes the life of a young girl names Francie very well.  I believe the novel is very hard to put  down.  It makes me want to keep going on.  This is a great novel for  anyone.
0684867621|3.0|Though this was unlike any Steven King I've read (Bag of Bones being my favorite), it was interesting. This young little girl shows the strength and stamina you seem to expect from a young child. Her undying love for the  game of baseball and in particular, Boston Red Sox player Tom Gordon, is in  itself the fuel she uses to keep going. The games her mind plays on her  makes the long lost journey in the woods even more real. You want to take  her in your arms and make it all go away and give her a good warm meal and  a hug. He's right, I wouldn't want this to happen to my daughter or anyone  else's for that matter. I think being alone in the woods and lost at night  would probably be the scariest thing a child could imagine. Try reading it  through a child's eyes.  What a brave little girl!
B0000025YL|5.0|One of the greatest heavy metal albums ever released, great songs and great chainsaw sound. Pity they never had another album like it.
B00000IQV1|5.0|I am a Pre-Medicine Major.  I have been having trouble with the workload and was afraid that my life-long dream of helping others was going to remain just that, a dream.  Then I saw this movie.  It was a total  inspiration!  I cried throughout the entire movie, as it profoundly touched  me.  It made me remember why I am studying what I am studying.  I plan to  buy this movie as soon as it comes out and review it anytime I feel like  giving up.  I would be proud to be a member of Patch Adams staff in the  future.  This movie was an awe-inspiring tale of a true life story! Thank  you, for letting Patch's story be told!
6304618344|5.0|I WOULD GIVE THIS MOVIE MORE THAN A 5 TO GOOD TO GOO
0790731509|5.0|Who can forget that Luke smile?  Paul Newman and George Kenedy give the best performances of their careers (which is saying something).  I had to break up with a girl once because she didn't cry at the end of the movie.
6303027016|4.0|THIS FILM DOES MAKE ME LAUGH I RECMMEND IT TO A WAR VET OR A MOVIE BUF
6305358567|5.0|Shekhar Kapur has made a cinematic masterpiece in &quot;Elizabeth.&quot;  With a stellar international cast, amazing cinematography, and a richly dark atmosphere straight out of a David Fincher film, &quot;Elizabeth&quot;  is sure to keep viewers stuck to their couches until the very last second.  Cate Blanchett is wonderful and Geoffrey Rush, as her master of spies,  practically steals the show.  It is a must watch.  Watch for Shekhar  Kapur's name to go to the top of the movie-maker list very soon.
6304126344|5.0|WHAT A GREAT FLIC
B00000IO4J|5.0|I rented this flick expecting nothing more than a stupid, SCREAM-like &quot;horror&quot; movie...well, I was wrong. Yes, it does have all the teeny-bopper stars in it....but the movie admits the &quot;borrowed&quot;  storylines of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and the like by referencing  them a few times throughout the film, which I liked.<br />While this Kevin  Williamson era of &quot;horror&quot; we are in right now is annoying me,  THE FACULTY is a movie that stands on its own. This film has you saying  &quot;Oh...****&quot; quite often, and the plot, premise and movie as a  whole is just downright entertaining.<br />I rather liked the cast, and  Rodriguez's directing is awesome. Also noteable was the performance of  Robert Patrick (Terminator 2), who delivers in THE FACULTY as a dark and  menacing football coach turned alien.<br />All in all, well worth your time  and your money....
0792837916|4.0|THIS MOVIE WAS GOOD I THINK THE PLOT WAS GOOD AND I THINK THAT JOHN TRAVOLTA DID A GOOD JOB ON THIS ONE
0780622553|3.0|As a movie, I would give _Dark City_ at least 4 stars. However, the current DVD is seriously compromised; where other movies encode a 2-hour movie in two layers, this one uses a single layer. The end result is very  noticable &quot;jaggies&quot; during dark scenes (which are quite often).
6303566669|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS BETTER THAN A STUPID LOVE STORY AND  GIANT SHIP SINKING THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING
B000002GXJ|5.0|Get this cd just for Desperado, it's sounds great.  One of the better, actually the best cd I own.
6300214540|5.0|TOM WAS GREAT IN THIS MOVI
630514415X|5.0|He Got Game touched me on many levels. Other reviewers have eloquently pointed to the powerful subplots within the film. But it was the music that drove me nuts. I loved it! Lee's use of Aaron Copeland musical fanfares and  themes was brilliant. Especially since Copeland is considered one of the  best American composers of the 20th century. And, oh yeah__he was born and  raised in Brooklyn!!! My hat is off to Spike Lee for sharing his passion  and love for the place he knows as home. Spike Lee is Brooklyn through and  through, forever and ever. Amen.
B00000INEX|1.0|Our two month old has loved Baby Mozart since she was a mere 4 weeks, yet STILL loves to watch it for the full time straight (yes, even with her &quot;baby attention span&quot;).   We LOVE everything about Baby Mozart.    HOWEVER . . . (you knew there was a however) Baby Back is a HUGE  disappointment.  The video is hardly interesting (even to us grownups, who  enjoy watching Baby Bach with our daughter), and appears to be an exercise  in vanity for the video's makers, who have inserted their  oh-so-trendily-named children throughout the video.  Are we sure that this  video wasn't made by Kathie Lee Gifford????   Meanwhile, the toys are slow  moving, and boring to watch.  My daughter has been bored to tears  (literally) every time she watches this drivel.   Baby Mozart, however,  never fails to disappoint. Musicwise, while I LOVE Bach (more than Mozart),  herr German Composer is given short shrift in this video.   MORAL:  STAY  AWAY FROM IT AND BUY BABY MOZART INSTEAD!!!!!
B000000W5P|5.0|Ah, I would gladly sacrifice &quot;Start Me Up&quot; if the Rolling Stones had only stopped here, on this peak! (It's sobering to think they have been second rate for twenty years now - which is longer than they were first  rate.) This is non-stop fun, great tunes, great lyrics, even some laughs. I  agree with the other listener who says the Stones never made a better album  than this.
6304698526|5.0|I saw the movie when it first came out and hadn't seen it for a number of years until recently. It still packs a whallop! Steve Mcqueen couldn't have picked a better role as Lt. Frank Bullitt. A no-nonsense cop who is trying  to solve a double murder while fighting politics in order to complete the  investigation. It still has a great car chase.
B00000F1D3|5.0|This is one of the best CDs that Cher has put out.  I really loved &quot;Believe&quot; and &quot;Strong Enough&quot; I have been a Cher fan since Sonny &amp; Cher I Got You, Babe.  She never looses the talent and  can always reinvent herself to the times and come on strong.
0790731894|1.0|Hi, The movie is great, the DVD sucks!  I don't have a lot of DVDs but I got this one home tonight and it looks like $h#t!  From the opening credits, the text is jumpy, you see small blocks besides the lettering...is  very awful.  It almost looks like a VHS tape was used in the making of this  DVD it's so bad.  I cannot believe Warner Brothers would release such a  pathetic copy of a great movie.  One very disappointed customer!  -Rick
0792152328|4.0|I am a big fan of Titanic...not just the movie but the ship also.  After this movie, there are two types of fans..fans b/c of the history (me), and fans b/c of the movie and leo. This should not be the case, but it is.   Anyway, I think Leo is a horrible actor (oh, get over it, y'all!).  He's  cute enough, but he sure as hell cannot act.  Other than that, the movie  was great.  I have seen it five times.  Happy viewing.
0790733897|5.0|Steve Mcqueen is very cool, especially in this one.  The car chase between Bullitt's mustang and the bad guy's charger is wild.  A very stylish and action packed film.  For Mcqueen fans, cop movie fans, and or car chase  fans.
0767819462|3.0|I liked the movie pretty much, but the kids were really cocky and a little too old for their age..especially Ben.  Anna really treated the whole situation very unrealistically.  Some things that were said and done would  definitely not happen in real life.  Do not buy this, just rent it.  It's  worth that, but it's not worth it to own it.
0792107683|5.0|Buy &quot;High Noon&quot; as well.  Both are great, see them for your self.  Read some reviews as well, I have never read a bad one of either.
0767817443|4.0|Godzilla? Well, okay, your the boss! Alright, first I'd just like to say, this movie rocked! But, as I watched it for the first time at a special day-before screening, I thought of a movie  I saw in summer of 1996. I  didn't remember the (let's face it, complicated) title of the film. I did  remember Ray Harryhausen's amazing effects, and the basic plot. Later that  summer, I went to Suncoast and picked up a copy of this effects classic. I  watched it and liked it. And it  warmely reminded me of my favorite movie  of that summer. Let's look at some similarities: 1. Both attack New York.  2. Both are very similar in physical apperence, and both are related to  true dinosaur species. 3. Both the main characters are nuclear scientists.  4. And finally (only because I'm almost out of room), both main army  attacks take place at night.  The reason I liked Godzilla so much, was  because all the good things about TBF20kF, were recreated with Jurassic  Park style visual effects. Unlike TBF20kF, Godzilla's characters were  waffer thin, though they were entertaining. All in all I give this film 4  stars. If you like creature features, check out the newer films Mimic,  Starship Troopers, and Anaconda (none of which I thought were as good as  Godzilla). Or, check out some classics and cult favorites that inspired  these modern efforts: The Deadly Mantis, Them!, The Giant Behemoth, Gorgo,  20 Million Miles To Earth, and of corse, the movie Godzilla was SOPPOSED to  be inspired by: Godzilla: King Of The Monsters!
0790733897|5.0|Mcqueen is a brooding detective (Bullitt) who is protecting a witness who is very important to a big time lawyer, Robert Vaughn (Chaulmers).  A fantastic car chase ensues and the ending keeps you very involved.  Very  stylish and stands out as one of the best cop/action films ever, from 1968  to now.
B000002LQR|5.0|The best RHCP CD....a must for everyone, goes from the hard punk-funk of &quot;Suck My Kiss&quot; to the rockballad of &quot;Under The Bridge&quot; to the funny ass lyrics of &quot;Sir Psycho Sexy&quot;...a must
B000002UY5|5.0|Blind Melon's first album is one of the best albums ever.  Others include the Beatles' Sgt Peppers', Smashing Pumpkins Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, U2's Joshua Tree, and Pearl Jam's Ten.  Buy it.  Enough said.
B0000019PA|5.0|this was one of those CD's I bought on a whim, with no clue of what it contained. With in the first 30 seconds I was screaming with joy!!! This is an album that you will love with a passion or you will hate, as the  preceeding reviews prove. Though I don't understand at all how anyone  could. The melodies speak to the soul!!!!!!!
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Pepper's is one of the best albums of all time.  Others include Smashing Pumpkins Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, Blind Melon's first album, U2's Josua Tree, and Pearl Jam's Ten.  The Beatles' Revolver  and Rubber Soul are also solid contenders.  Enough said.
B000000H48|4.0|This album might be the King's heaviest to date. Sleepless nights might be his best song. Listen with the lights off and enjoy.
0671502336|5.0|Satirical farce about the insanities of the Military. I do not think it is as much anti war as it is anti military. The characters are insanely funny - Yossarian, Orr, Major Major, Milo, Doc Daneeka, The Chaplain, Hungry Joe.  This should be required reading at the military acadamies.<br />It rate this  book in the top five of American fiction. Compares favorably with  Huckleberry Finn as far as enjoyment level with undercurrent themes.
0688170528|5.0|This is such a touching novel; in my eyes it describes a teenage relationship so well. I could relate to Chris and Emily's feelings and I felt everything they were going through. A must read!
0553213105|4.0|I must be honest and say that I had a prejudice against the book. I never thought that I would ever enjoy such a novel. To my surprise I could not put it down. The characters had charisma and charm and the tale holds a  universal theme that can be understood despite the decades. I throughly  enjoyed this book. A classic, timeless, and amazing piece of literature, I  have the utmost regards for this novel. It was a spectacular piece of work  that I cannot say enough about. Wonderful!
0385484518|1.0|I had heard wonderful reviews of this book and how the author had done such a wonderful job with the subject of death and dying. I have no doubt that Morrie was a brilliant man and wonderful teacher. I suppose as with  everything in life, we appreciate what we have too late. It struck me that  this was the case with Mr. Albom. Funny, if Morrie was his favorite teacher  and someone whom he treasured, why did the man have to be dying for Mr.  Albom to be in communication with him once again??? Could it be for the  right to share the dying experience and be enlightened, or could it be due  to the fact that Mr. Albom was not working at that time and writing about  Morrie was a convenient money-making option. I, too, have had a friend die  of ALS, but never in my wildest dreams would I have commercialized his  death for my own personal notoriety and gain. I also have a favorite  teacher from my youth and am still a student learning from him, 30 years  after the classroom. I didn't wait until he was in tragic circumstances to  resume contact and I have made it a point to let him know during every  visit that he made a great influence on my life and still inspires me to do  my best. I only wish Mr. Albom had had the guts to let his professor die in  peace and dignity. And, it appears that the things Morrie abhorred about  our life in the nineties were the very things that nurtured the author. Sad  testament to our society.
080017948X|5.0|I know I'm just repeating what so many others have said, but this is just a great movie.<br />Groundhog day is one of the unnoticed gems, movies that people expect to be lightweight that are  revealed to be deeply meaningful. Others I put in that category are  Cadence, The Frighteners, and Drop Dead Fred, but Groundhog Day is the  best.
B00000IFWE|5.0|I've always liked Tom Petty, but never really been a fan-I just liked his hits like Free Fallin', You Don't Know How It Feels, and Walls.  When I bought Echo on impulse, though, I became a full-fleged fan.  The album is  incredible, starting out smooth and easy with Room at the Top's haunting  organ notes.  Free Girl Now, Swingin', and I Don't Wanna Fight are the only  truly rocking songs on the album, the rest are fairly slow, and somewhat  bleak.  The song Echo should be very depressing (if you really listen to  the lyrics, you'll understand) but the music and Petty's delivery make it  just a beautiful song.  I highly recommend this CD.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I found this CD in a local music store's sample area (like another reviewer), grabbed the CD, and couldnt wait to get home and listen to the CD over and over again. I thought I had heard her voice before, and now I  know after reading the other reviews--Sliding Doors. Dido has sung her way  into my favorite CDs after only two days, and I cannot wait for another CD  from her. Don't hesitate for a second on this CD!
B00000ILBK|4.0|I must disagree with all the critics that have given 'Star Trek: Insurrection' bad reviews. It contains many memorable scenes, and it's a movie with a good plot and storyline. It may not be as good as 'First  Contact', but it's a  very good movie! It follows the good traditions of  'Star Trek'; Excelent Special Effects, rich story, excitment, drama,  action, humour and much more. It's got everything one would want, a must  see!
0385493800|2.0|I've always enjoyed John's books but this one definitely falls short. In fact I wasnt even half way through I quit reading. I can't remember the last book I didn't finished,even if it was bad! This one was too  slow,boring and repetitive.
0792839625|4.0|Chrous line is one of those musicals that I rent again and again.  I never get tired of the story and always love the character twists.  The quality I like is the depth and personality of each character.  The music sticks in  my head, especially &quot;Nothing&quot; sung by Morales (Yamil Borges),  which I can sing in my sleep.  A great movie for anyone intersted in the  stage life. Fascinating.
6305358567|5.0|Nearly every frame is like a painting.  Blanchett is like a god, every gesture bringing grace and beauty to a Tudor monarch, but with the youthful flesh and blood of a woman, too.  Here is a likely young Elizabeth I.  Rush  (Walsingham) as a loyal and deadly snake is unforgettable. And Joe F.  (Dudley) is superior to his love in Shakespeare.  Nearly a perfect film.
6302798450|5.0|The first time I saw any Evil Dead movie, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I figured they'd be the worst, as in goriest films of all time, but no!  They are among the funniest films.  ARMY of DARKNESS, is the best of the Evil  Dead Trilogy!  It has the best story line, best comic roles, too.
B00000J7JO|4.0|I was at the local Tower Records to buy the new Santana CD, and just happened to see that this CD was in the listening section.  I decided to give it a listen, and was I glad I did.  The Cd is full of great material,  and the listener wont be disappointed.  The RHCP make a great comeback with  this CD, and it ranks up thier with Mother's Milk, and BloodSugarSexMagic  as one of their best
B000000H66|5.0|This is the tightest death cd to date... i've loved these guys since Scream Bloody Gore and every album gets better, cept Human being better then Individual... But this album takes it all... it combines great  melodies and guitar harmonies with chuck destinct growl... which has also  gotten to its peak here... Gene Hoglan (DRUM GOD) brings awesome timings...  But for the stupid person who said Gene was in Morbid Angel... your  retarded... Morbid Angel has always had the commando ... know what your  talking about before you write it... moron...
B00000BKE1|4.0|This album takes alot of abuse because of some real stinkers that made it by 'Maiden Quality Control', but for the most part THIS IS A GOOD ALBUM. Don't stand still for people telling you how worthless it is.<br />Be Quick or  Be Dead and From Here to Eternity are good enough Hard Rock tracks, Wasted  Love and Judas Be my Guide are REALLY GOOD SONGS. Childhoods end, Afraid to  shoot Strangers, and the title track itself are all as good as anything  Iron Maiden has ever done on ANY album.<br />That's seven good songs right  there, enough for most albums,  and the songs Fear is the Key and the  Fugitive  are decent enough songs to  make the cut for any Maiden album.  Even Powerslave had &quot;Back in the Village&quot; after all.<br />This  albums entire bad reputation lies on three complete SNAFU'd songs that  Maiden let onto the album in some vain attempt to inflate the track total  and running time. Weekend Warrior (bad AC/DC song basically), Chains of  Misery (annoying AND repetitive), and The Apparition..which is the worst  song I've ever heard in my ENTIRE LIFE, no hyperbole intended.<br />If this  had been a typical 8-9 song Maiden album, it would be remembered as a  comeback from NO PRAYER FOR THE DYING, and a classic album. But because  someone wanted more songs...your typical fan hates it. I do reccomend this  album, but get it in CD form. You're going to want to skip a handful of  tracks to get to the truly GREAT songs that really really are on this  album.
B00000ILBK|4.0|I only caught this film once at the cinema. Various things prevented me from seeing it again. Fortunately the DVD release has enabled me to check the film out again and I find that it improves with viewing. The reviewer  who talks about moving away from machines etc seems to be talking about a  different movie. The Baku have opted for a simpler life, they are not  luddites. Nor is there anything in the plot to suggest that they soon  realise their need to depend on machines. Try watching it next time.<br />All  in all I thought that it was well paced and thought provoking. There are  many examples in history of minority interests being trampled and this  &quot;greater good for the greater number&quot; ideology is sadly still  prevalent in the world. I like the message of the film and it restores my  faith in the Star Trek saga. Voyager still has a long way to go before it  gets this good. This film is a breath of fresh air and in spite of all  those who criticise it because it comes across as an extended TV episode I  think its good that there is the occasional film which moves away from  space battles. I hope that there will be more Next Generation cast movies  to come and perhaps its time to have two sets of movies, the other series  to feature DS9.<br />This DVD is a good transfer and the sound is good. Its a  pity that there aren't any other features even some bios might have been  nice.<br />For those who like the more thoughtful Star Treks this is a good  film. For those who like photon torpedoes galore wait for Wrath of Khan.
B000002BE9|5.0|IF you are obsessed with Fi or just plain like her music this is a must have.
B000001FI7|5.0|This album has established its own genre. Portishead should be very proud of themselves. <br />This is a captivating and welcoming album, although for me - it was difficult to get into. Now, it is irresistable. In my  opinion,&quot;Sour Times&quot; is the worst song - even though it is still  VERY good. Songs like &quot;Pedestal,&quot; &quot;Mysterons,&quot; and  &quot;Biscuit&quot; just blow me away though. Trip-hop has never sounded  finer. <br />Purchasing this album is one of the most legitimate reasons for  spending fifteen dollars that I've heard... Money very well  spent.<br />rating: A+
6304813759|5.0|I am not a big fan of comedies because they rarely make me laugh.  I gauge them by how often and how hard I laugh when viewing by myself - and it almost never happens.  This movie is THE exception!  But it's not just  funny, it's also a wonderful story with honest-to-goodness characters.  I  rarely re-watch movies but I've  seen this one 4 times in less than a week  and am buying the tape so I can watch it anytime I want to &quot;feel  good&quot;.  Even the best description doesn't do it justice, you have to  see if for yourself!
B00000IQV1|5.0|He was there during the worse time in my life. He made my three month stay in the hospital bearable. This should be manditory for all new doctors and nurses to see. Robin Williams does the part justice and I can't wait to add  it to my other movies. It's great and warms my memories!!
B000000H3Z|5.0|Slayer has their &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;, and this is Sepulturas...Almost perfect from start to finish, this album begins with godly title track and moves through 8 other thrash classics, making you  want more.  If you want a thrash album to add to your collection besides  the general 3 (Megadeth, Metallica, Slayer), this is the one.
0312117337|5.0|Wondrous, simplistic artwork attracts everyone.  The cards draw out the underlying issues and increase the confidence of relying upon your intuition.  I have used this deck for over 3 years now and it has never  failed me.  I have always been able to reach the innermost crevices of the  person I'm reading for.  I love it and will continue to use it as long as  the deck will last!
B00000G3PA|4.0|It was fun and you damn well know it.  Fellow film buffs and critics, we all know anybody who said this is a great movie doesn't know the first thing about film, so don't write something negative in response.  This  movie didn't attempt to do any but entertain with humor and great special  effects and it succeeded; why complain about it not having the elements of  a serious film when it doesn't attempt to.  You want a film to complain  about for being pretentious and unrealistic, write a review of A Time To  Kill.
B000000OUE|5.0|White Zombie has done it again, this the best CD I have ever bought

B00000IO4I|1.0|I had been looking forward to seeing this movie when it came on video and was very disappointed.  The performances by Caine, Blethyn, and Jane Horrocks were all great.  and Horrocks voice - amazing!  the best spot in  the movie is when you get to see her on stage performing and that isn't  enough film to make up for the depressing lot of it..it is a depressing  story, the mother is awful to her....  if you like depressing, annoying  movies, rent it...otherwise leave it on the shelf...

B000002KGT|5.0|Fleetwood Mac's &quot;Rumours&quot; is a rock n' roll experience of perfect clarity and amazingly elegant simplicity.  The recording is a musical masterpiece as well as a revealing portrait of the turbulent period  that was endured by Fleetwood Mac's five gifted members.  The sound of  &quot;Rumours&quot; is pure and uncluttered.  Each musician is heard with  marvelous distinction.  There is much that can be said about  &quot;Rumours&quot;, but there is no denying that it remains forever a  timeless classic.
B00000IOSU|3.0|Those who enjoyed McLachlan's recent radio hits may find this album to be satisfying and complete, but long-time fans of the Canadian vocalist may be disappointed to find that songs from &quot;Touch&quot; and  &quot;Solace&quot; (her first two albums) are mostly ignored. &quot;The  Path Of Thorns (Terms)&quot; is the only representative of McLachlan's  earlier work, even though &quot;Vox&quot;, &quot;Into The Fire&quot;, and  &quot;I Will Not Forget You&quot;, among others, remain staples in her live  sets.<br />As for what is on the album, the songs are a rather straightfoward  interpretation of her studio versions. There is little to no  experimentation or tweaking of the arrangements: She just plays it  conservatively, serving up tracks that sound like studio cuts with crowd  noise. While a fan excitedly watching McLachlan perform in person may not  be bothered by her conservative approach, those listening to this CD at  home or in their car may not be convinced of the greatness of her live  shows. This doesn't mean that her performance is awful: In fact, it's very  good. But what is the point of a live album that does nothing to expand on  her studio performances? Also missing is her between-song banter, which  adds humor and charm to her live shows.<br />The album is a bit of a  disappointment because of these shortcomings, but for fans who have had the  pleasure of seeing McLachlan live, this should serve as a decent souvenir.
6300181251|5.0|The opening scenes show Phoenix as it was in 1960. This has all been torn down now. The scenes are like a moving real photo postcard collection. As for the rest of the movie, it is really a classic study in black and white,  using shadows, angles and so on.

B000002NHN|5.0|Loreena McKennitt again proves that music can have form as well as function.  The &quot;Book of Secrets&quot;, the artists seventh recording, provides a clear example of how well an album can be produced.  McKennitt  has created not only an expression of integrity, but also she provides her  listeners with a highly enjoyable experience.  The consistency of the songs  makes this an ideal album to listen to from beginning to end without  dancing about from track to track.  The recording's varied yet balanced  instrumentation provides the perfect accompaniment to McKennitt's  ambitiously angelic vocals.  The songwriting is superb and adds to the  multi-dimensional quality of the album.  It is evident that a great deal of  work went into this project.  The &quot;Book of Secrets&quot; is a bold,  musical adventure as well as an artistic statement from one of our era's  most prolific musicians.
B000002IGV|5.0|I defy anyone to name a better group than Twisted Sister. They defined youth rebellion, angst, and tortured lives well in advance of all these fools today. Dee Snider was brilliant and always ready with the  Shakespeare-worthy lyrics about the difficulty of life in these United  States. If I could, I'd give it a million stars. Brilliance I say,  brilliance!
0767819594|5.0|Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) was great and as beautifull as ever and her fans will want to see this!!! It's got a good plot too, so even if you aren't a big fan of Sarah (which is highly  unlikely if you ever watched anything she's did) you'll still want to watch  and buy this movie!
B000002AS3|5.0|Definetly Maybe is the best Beatles sounding album that Oasis has ever released. Probably the best lyrics that Noel ever wrote (aside from Don't Go Away, and Champagne Supernova). If you dont mind goofy lyrics with  simple, distorted guitar, this is a great CD to add to a collection.
6305014140|5.0|This is the movie that initially launched my love for anime! The storyline is incredible, and the animation is exceptional!

6305499365|5.0|(this movie is by Mike Judge, the creator of Beavis and Butthead, so you know it's good) If you hate your job, or don't have a job and think you're missing something, you'll want to see this. Also most kids can relate to  how the main character (Livingston) hates his job (like school) and all the  annoying things that happen every single day, and all those annoying bosses  and co-workers you just want to punch. He does what most dream of but never  dare to do... he says screw it and quits, and makes the company that has  been useing him all these years and never promoting him and expect all his  time, to work for him for a change... But I don't want to give it all away,  so let me just say, GIVE YOUR HEART A WORK OUT AND WATCH (and buy) THIS  MOVIE FOR NON-STOP LAUGHTER!!!!!

0887307280|5.0|I am now using this book as a text for a college level course designed for Information Technology students.  I read the original version about 6 years ago when I purchased it for 39 cents at a thrift store.  Having been a  business systems analyst for many years I used these techniques but never  knew it.  Now using the messages in this book, I can share techniques that  work with others. This book is a practical giude to business problem  solving and it can be used to design useful information systems and  implement effective training in any size operation. The  &quot;Revisited&quot; edition has been enhanced using a case-study approach  that makes the message easily understood by any reader. Employers today  want more from employees than mere technical proficiency.  They want people  who can analyze their business and provide viable technical solutions that  contribute to a good work environment as well as to bottom line success.  This book focuses not only on developing a good business strategy but also  on the leadership skills required to develop a business and meet goals.  It  provides all the steps needed to implement these ideas in the real world.   It is an exellent book for the technician, the manager or the entrepreneur.   Whether you run or are a part of any business I highly recommend it.
6302732875|4.0|Jack Lemmon is superb in this intrinsic movie about the harsh realities of the real estate game. I you love intense drama or enjoy fast paced talk , while peering into the psychology of real salesmen , this is for you .  Goodfellas , Wall Street kind of intensity . Buy it on DVD and call your  girlfriend , tell her she's staying the night , you will never look at  salesmen the same way again . It is harsh , but undeniably attractive ,  Pacino is also magnificent as Roma the suave hustler .

0767817478|1.0|I don`t know weather to laugh or cry, either way this movie was horrible. From the point where each charicter was introduced I waited patiently for them to die but no, they all live to shock and horrify once again if theres  a sequal.  I would have rather seen some guy in a rubber suit with paint  chipping off the eye then this hemaphrodite iguana that is the size of a 4  story building in one scene then in the next he is stepping on a four story  building.There are no redeming qualities to this movie the actors are as  bad as the characters they play, Godzilla just shows up and the people  (seeing a new species) decide to kill it. The moral &quot;if its different  it must die.&quot;
6304233639|5.0|Independence Day was so much better than the critics said it was.  In my mind, Independence Day was very good.  The alien attack showed how people will work together in a tense situation, even if they don't want to.  Besides that, there were many relationships to see and how they changed.  The flight scenes were incredibly done, the alien autopsy was cool, and the acting was awesome.  All around, Independence Day is worth buying and seeing many times.
068815333X|5.0|I live in Dorchester/Boston where Dennis Lehane's novels take place. He has a great feel for the area, both in terms of geography and culture, which he conveys without forcing the sense of place. More importantly for a  detective novel, Lehane weaves an incredibly strong mystery; he paces the  revelations out perfectly right up to the very last page. And he does so in  style. His prose is for the most part funny, chilling at times and at other  moments painfully moving. Even more interesting for a detective series,  Lehane hasn't lost focus of the main characters (Patrick, Angie and Bubba)  nor has he let them grow stale. Just as he tosses a few curveballs into the  investigation, he also throws major curveballs into Patrick, Angie and  Bubba's personal lives. Lehane also introduces a number of new and  extremely hatable villains. This is his best book since &quot;Darkness Take  My Hand.&quot;

0684867621|4.0|The Girl who Loved Tom Gordon is a must-read for Stephen King fans. It was tantalizing and suspenseful. I liked other King books better. Namely, Insomnia and Gerald's Game. The first hundred pages of The Girl who Loved  Tom Gordon were relatively uneventful. However,this was of minor importance  because the entire book can be read in an afternoon. I designated this book  with such a high rating based on the fact that it is an invention of the  genius Stephen King.
0887307280|5.0|Why should I go and get an MBA before I start my business when I can get guidance like this?  This book isn't just about how to run a business, but about a whole new point of view.  If you get &quot;it&quot; after reading  this book, your professional life will never be the same.  Most small  businesses fail, but businesses that practice this  &quot;point-of-view&quot; will increase their chances of success  exponentially.  Most small business owners give up just when they are given  the opportunity to prove they really are entrepreneurs.  If you're a small  business owner, NOT reading this book could be the biggest mistake you'll  ever make.  The smartest thing you could ever do after reading this book is  to adopt the point of view, and seek to &quot;get it&quot; to a level where  it makes a difference in your business.
0394492196|5.0|I read my books or listen to the tape of this trilogy every couple of years.  It's a pleasurable ritual. I look forward to the next time the instant I turn the final page of Smiley's People and the hairs on my  forearms stand erect and the shiver starts at the base of my spine.   DON'T  omit The Hounorable Schoolboy.  The gold seam is critical, and to fail to  know Jerry Westerby is a great loss. The actions taken by George after the  fall are some of the most intricate and subtle examples of foreshadowing in  literature.  To carry all the threads, from Oxford in the twenties through  the ascendency of the Cousins, to the final, fateful humanity of Karla, one  must not skip a paragraph.   The video referred to I remember as delightful  to watch.  I saw it on PBS in the 80's and failed to tape it and have been  trying to locate a copy.  I discovered the fact that TTSS was televised in  1979 and Smiley's People was televised in 1982. I intend to continue to  search for the source of the videotape and will write again if I find it.   If anyone else has a lead, please let me know.
0792140923|2.0|Deriving much from both &quot;Zelig&quot; and &quot;Being There&quot;, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; apes the humour of one and the irony of the other to spin this engaging tale of an all-American simpleton triumphing against  the odds. Gump travels through late 'sixties America runnning the gauntlet  of the Vietnam war and having brushes with both the Black Panther movement  and the Watergate scandal. These scenes are fragmented, told as they are in  Gump's own anecdotal narrative, and leave little room for any consistent  theme or attempt at allegory. As each heart-warming episode follows the  next it soon becomes clear that &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is here to deliver  easy Hollywood emotion and not a great deal else. &quot;Jenny&quot;, the  love of Gump's life, appears intermittently for romantic interest, but  these sudden appearances are never explained and her final mothering of  &quot;Forrest jnr.&quot; (tacked-on to ensure a weepy finale) seems cheap  and superficial. The much lauded special effects, allowing Gump to meet  Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon are doubtless state-of-the-art but are used to  less effect than in Woody Allen's &quot;Zelig&quot; and appear a little  contrived.  This is certainly an entertaining film but it carries no  discernable message for its audience, jus' a mountain load of good ol'  cotton candy.
B000005IRG|5.0|Quite simply, either you &quot;get it&quot; or you don't; but if you don't, I suspect you have one too many Hootie and the Blowfish cds in your collection and not a single Coltrane, Pere Ubu or Captain Beefheart.<br />A  timeless one of a kind masterwork.

B000002GK1|5.0|First of all, let me start by saying that until Soundgarden, I HATED this type of music!! Actually, the first album I heard of theirs was Superunknown, which was fabulous lyrically (and musically). But my husband  enlightened me with this record! If you are a Music Nerd, this is the  Soundgarden album you need to buy!!! Matt Cameron's drumming is insanely  good on this album and the rest of the band are not far behind him. I can't  even tell you which songs I like best. This whole album is a body of work!  These guys rock, no doubt, but first and foremost they are MUSICIANS. It  doesn't matter what kind of music you like (my favorite band is The Cocteau  Twins!!!) You will not be able to deny the fact that this is a GREAT album  and an extremely talented band. Open your ears and your minds kiddies!!!  This isn't Grunge or Metal or even Rock....this is just plain GOOD!!!!!

0688170528|5.0|...I bit off all my best nails reading this book-- it's that suspenseful. All these 5-star reviews might make you suspicious that this author has a  really big family.  But I swear, I've never met her, just read the book on  a recommendation. It was completely riveting. Suspenseful, painfully   honest, thought-provoking. I was reminded somewhat of MIDWIVES by  Chris  Bohjalian and THE MOST WANTED by Jacqueline Mitchard, but I felt THE PACT  was more suspenseful and better  written. Not a &quot;comfortable&quot;  read due to the subject matter, but a wonderful read. Believe all the  passionate reviews here.

0871137380|5.0|Great book.  Not for those with a weak stomach though. It gives you a revealing look behind the scenes as this operation went from a humanitarian one to one devoted to capturing the tribal leader Aidid. It also  impartially analyzes who was responsible for that mission shift.

006092988X|5.0|I read this book along with my class and my language teacher in the seventh grade. This is one of the best-written books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. This isn't a book for short-story readers and it's  definitely not one for fairytale readers. This book gives a vivid,  firsthand account of a young girl growing up in turn-of-the-century  Brooklyn, and it deals with all aspects of society, no matter how shocking  or taboo they may normally seem. This book describes literally ever aspect  of this young girl's life, and I think that the author should be praised  for examining the issues that she did and presenting them without the  silver lining that isn't there in real life. This is a wonderful book for  fans of history and especially for fans of good literature. Books like this  one don't come along very often, and if you haven't read it then you're  missing a great work of literature.
B00000ILBK|4.0|I am a huge fan of the Next Generation TV series, and I enjoyed this movie because, of the three, this movie is most true to the series. The first two movies were entertaining, but so self-conscious in trying to be  &quot;bigger&quot; than the series. In short, they tried way too hard. I  felt like I was watching charicatures of the crew rather than the  well-developed, round characters I had come to know. This edition plays  like a typical Next Gen episode - the characters say things that make you  laugh at loud at their idiosyncracies, a moral/logical problen faces the  crew, and space battles are minimal. It makes you think a little, and it is  fun. So this movie won't please fans looking for a  spaceship shoot 'em up.  But I don't see how these fans could have sat through the TV series either.  Extended space battles are not what it was about.  And when they have tried  to make the movies this way, the foundation of Star Trek has been unable to  suport this type of plot. It just comes off looking silly. By staying true  to the series, fans of The Next Generation will walk away  from this film  feeling just like they did after a good episode.

0312853238|5.0|This is possibly the most wonderful book in the world of science fiction today.  I really don't have much to add to the other reviews, other than to say that I thought the sequels were at least as good as the original.  The  entire series is worthy of being read and reread, but even if you don't  want to read them all, Ender's Game is one you don't want to miss.

B000002NJS|5.0|I didn't realize how emotional 'techno' music could be, but leave it to Madonna to acclomplish that feat.  Her best song is Little Star, which was written for her daughter, it is spectacular. Sky Fits Heaven is also really  good.  Must have album for any Madonna fan.
0671027344|4.0|I'm not sure what exactly I can say about &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot; besides the fact that it wore me out and that I'm not sure why. It was a different sort of read. I didn't really identify with  Charlie, nor did I find him unbelievable. I thought it was a good portrait  of a person Maybe those who find this book to be out of touch with high  school as they know it simply know a lot less about the world than they  think they do. A lot of fiction is written for reasons other than  documenting normalities. &quot;1984,&quot; by George Orwell, is hardly  realistic... or is it? Everyone's perception is different, and it sometimes  is fascinating to see the world through someone else's eyes, even if their  vision clashes with yours. That's how I felt about this book. Is the  maelstorm of events that happen to Charlie realistic? Do kids like him  really exists? Is he a typical slice of Americana? Maybe, or maybe not. But  his world captivated me nonetheless. More than that it exhausted me, and I  would say for that response alone it was worth the effort to journey there.
B000001FY9|5.0|Legend offers the listener 14 of the best songs ever made, let alone 14 of the best reggae songs made.  The album offers all different sounds, rhythms, beats, and views of reggae and Bob Marley.  From &quot;Could You  Be Loved&quot; to &quot;Jamming&quot;, the listener gets fast reggae and  slower reggae, but awesome reggae all the same.

6305470448|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this movie (but I'll try!).  I've seen it five times in the theatre, and enjoyed it immensely every time.  The first time I saw it was a truly joyful experience.  It renewed my dying  faith in movies.  The writing, acting, cinematography, costumes and music  were perfect.  And the chemistry between the leads is nothing short of  astonishing.  It's the most romantic movie I've ever seen, and the best  overall movie I've seen in years.  Don't miss it.

6305308659|2.0|This movie deserved two star max. It is NOT entertaining and it is NOT thought-provoking. The movie also try to get some messages about freedom of speech and free thinking across but does not do it well.  The movie Big  (Starring Tom Hank)is one of my favorite so I bought Pleasantville before I  watch it..... big disappointment.  I realize that people have different  test about movie so I'm gonna give mine for reference..... example : I LIKE  : Dead Poet Society, Defending Your Life, Baby Boom, Four Wedding and a  Funeral, Ransom, Matrix, Pretty Woman   I HATE : Armageddon, Face Off, Con  Air    I Dislike : You've got mail, My best friend edding,  and  Pleasantville.  I read the comment from viewers below that gave the movie  one or two stars before I buy and I thought they were over reacted .... to  my regret... I read them again after I watched the movie and find myself  agree with much of what they've said. If you have not seen it I'd say you  don't miss anything much.

B000002GYN|4.0|I barely gave this cd 4 stars.  It does have some good songs, however most every song except those those on the greatest hits cd display a rather immature use of songwriting.  There are high points, but unless you really  like country music (not country rock or southern rock, much different) I  doubt you will like it.  Whatever you do, do not buy this cd as your first  eagles cd.  Get instead the very mature and awesome One Of These Night  (probably thier best) or Hotel California (extremely close, maybe the best,  I don't know)<br />Check out those cd's now if you havent already.

014028009X|5.0|This book is incredibly funny, I rarely, ok never,  buy humor books but I couldn't resist. I can completely relate to this book and I think anyone who has been in their early 30s and still single will too.  Or, if you've  ever stumbled into an office romance, via email no less.  Or, if you've  ever told yourself that it doesn't matter how much you weigh only to weigh  yourself three times in one night. Or, if you've ever gone to your friends  and spouted strident feminist wisdom after a particularily bad date, you  WILL relate.  And you will laugh at Bridget the same way you laugh at  yourself the next day.  It's not at all depressing even when Bridget hits a  stumbling block she does it with a sort of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;  humor. Buy it, buy it for your friend!
0380973464|1.0|Totally unlike Snow Crash or Diamond Age, this novel lacks any sci-fi imagination and instead is a disjointed journey from WW2 cryptography to modern data warehousing.  I finally gave up trying to follow the plot after  400 pages.

B00000DLVA|5.0|&quot;First Band on the Moon&quot; was eerily cute, but the sounds produced on &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; are deeper. I hate to use the word &quot;mature,&quot; but it seems that the band has tried out a different  sound, and it works out a lot better. Nina's vocals almost wore thin on  &quot;First,&quot; but here she gets more of a workout, and like the music,  her voice is fuller. The tunes and melodies themselves are also more  memorable, though that may have to do with the fact that I've listened to  this album 10,000 times already.
1573226521|3.0|The novel is a compelling read. I don't understand why some reviewers accuse it of being boring. It may not be the best piece of fiction ever written, but it is definitely not a snooze fest. And (again responding to  some previous reviews) if you actually took the time to read the whole  book, you will see that sex does occur -- just not in front of our faces. A  bit refreshing, if you ask me. And even if some of the characters are  underdrawn, remember that we are experiencing Richard's, and not a literary  omniscient narrator's, view of the world. We come to understand the  character of Richard through the way he describes his world. At any rate,  my main complaint about the novel has to do with its cynical philosophy, I  guess you could say. Yes, we know that utopia translates as &quot;no  place,&quot; etc. etc. That we ultimately cannot find and retain paradise.  But perhaps we need to base our searches for paradise on more than  Apocalypse Now, The Waltons, and other pop-cultural reminisces of the 60s  and 70s. There were, for example, actual positive and healthy changes that  occurred in the 60s--genuine struggles against racism, sexism, classism,  and the like. And even if we have not yet conquered those demons, we are  better off than we would have been if we hadn't attempted the struggle.  Garland's novel seems to suggest that pursuing the desire to live  authentically in a world that feels more genuine than the one you left  behind will lead to disaster. Like saying: don't try to find a better way  to live, because you'll just muck it up even more. Might not the attempt  for utopia lead to some improvements? Not paradise, not perfection, but  just a better, slightly-less-flawed world? Of course, it would probably  involve characters actually becoming socially engaged--rather than  detached--from the rest of the world. And it probably would involve a  recognition that mishaps will occur. But Boomers, Xers, and all ensuing  generations: Don't give up the journey, the attempt, just because humanity  didn't get it right the first few times.
6304143184|2.0|I just saw this movie for the first time.  To me, this is purely kids stuff.  I find it boring, badly acted, an unimaginative plot, and sappy. Emotionally, it does nothing for me.  The crass commercialism of flashing  brand names such as Reese's pieces and Reynolds Wrap is offensive to me.  Calling one's brother &quot;penis breath&quot; hardly rates as family fare,  and zillions of kids must have emulated that line.  One minute E.T. can't  talk and the next minute he's speaking the human language and understanding  everything--it's all  too silly.  I have no empathy for the poor, ugly  creature--Sorry!   Aside from the language, I guess it's an OK older kids  (say ages 8-14 or so) film, but a yawner for adults.  But then, I'm rarely  impressed with Hollywood.
0688158129|5.0|Wow, it was refreshing to read a book that dealt with real human emotion without throwing in an obligatory gay sexual interlude, an incestual episode, a wife-beating, or some form of contrived torture.  Ms Picoult  exhibits a clear and sensitive understanding of human nature in the  narrative of this book.  It is truly a study of the human psyche.  <br />I  understand that this book has been given movie rights.  I'll be looking  forward to seeing it on 'the big screen'.
0553108034|4.0|Another great book in this promising series.  The sheer mass of characters, all with individual personalities and motives, makes for an incredibly realistic tale.  Martin maintains an excellent pace, swithcing  from character to character to show how the whole story unfolds from a  variety of viewpoints.  Only problem with I found is that with so many  characters, it's hard to jump right into the second book without rereading  the first.  All in all, a great fantasy book.
0871137380|5.0|This is the BEST nonfiction I have ever read. It rivals even my favorite novels. The storytelling is so intense, real, and dramatic that you feel as if you were there. The picture painted of Rangers and Delta operators is  the best of any book I have ever read. I have heard that they are going to  make this into a movie and if they, and follow the Private Ryan form, then  this movie could be a modern day Oscar contender.
0790740443|1.0|I can't believe anyone could enjoy this film, theres nothing there to enjoy. The storyline is virtually non-existent, the acting minimal, dialog.... what dialog ? I think Russell must only say about 10 words total  in the whole film.<br />If you like pyrotechnics then you'll like this film,  otherwise avoid at all costs. Absolutely dire.
6300215814|5.0|this is audrey hepburns greatest movie and questionably the greatest movie of all time.Audrey moves u so much from thr beginning till the end.If u romaces this is a must see
B00000HZFP|3.0|I haven't seen the show. But the music is great with every song being catchy and totally amazing. Yet, it would be nice if they included a synopsis, something that will tell us what the hell is going on. It's  impossible to place the story and the music together- all I can tell is  that it's about a person who undergoes a sex change. If you like the show,  then I guess the CD is a good choice for you to buy. But if haven't seen  the show, get it only for the music and don't have any expectations of  understanding the plot.
0156528207|5.0|Really a great book that everybody should have one
B0000020C4|3.0|Actually, it's a great show. It has a story with so many plot twists and complex characters to make your head spin. And the music, at first, is also amazing. But, after watching some more shows, the music can also get  annoying. Not the really great songs, like &quot;On My Own&quot;,  &quot;Stars&quot; and &quot;Who am I&quot;, but the endless droning of  things like &quot;The Work Song&quot;, &quot;A Heart Full of Love&quot;  (the cheesiest song ever), &quot;Lovely Ladies&quot;, and &quot;At the End  of the Day&quot;. Frankly, songs like these just turn me off (and the CD)  completely. If you only see this show, however, you'll probably keep on  liking it. It's just one of those shows.
B00000F1D3|5.0|this song came out during a very painful break-up of my marriage but a much self-growth period and her lyrics were right on the mark and inspiring. as a result it became my theme song. tsomme@aol.com mobile ala.
0792153367|5.0|This movie is simply my favorite. It's so sweet and melanocholy and happy, I don't know what emotion it doesn't contain. Holly is just the best, and Peppard is handsome and adorable.  I can watch this movie every week!
0792156684|5.0|WHEN MY GRANDPARENTS,MY OLDERSISTER, AND I WENT TO A MOVIE THEATER, WE DON'T ACTUALY KNOW WHAT MOVIE TO WATCH. THEN MY SISTER SUGGESTED TO WATCH TITANIC. FIRST I DON'T WANT TO WATCH IT,BUT I DECIDED TO GIVE IT A CHANCE.  WHEN THE MOVIE START THE FIRST ATTRACTED ME WAS THE MUSIC AT THE BEGINNING  OF THE MOVIE. IT'S LIKE I FEEL THE SADNESS AND HEARTACHE OF THOSE PEOPLE  WHO LOSE SOMEONE THAT WAS VERY CLOSE TO THEM. I REALY LOVE THE THE  CHARACTER OF JACK AND ROSE PLAYED BY LEONARDO AND KATE.  THEY SHOW YOU HOW  LOVE CHANGE OUR DESTINY. THEY ONLY MET FOR 2OR3 DAYS ,BUT THEIR LOVE FOR  EACH OTHER WAS TOO STRONG AND NO ONE COULD COME BETWEEN THEM EXCEPT DEATH.   AND AT THE PART OF THE MOVIE WHEN JACK TELL ROSE TO PROMISE HIM TO GO ON,  IT ALMOST MAKE ME CRY. IT'S LIKE I'M IN THE MOVIE. AND I ALSO LIKE THE WAY  JAMES CAMERON END THE MOVIE. IT SHOW HOW JACK AND ROSE REALLY LOVE EACH  OTHER.  AFTER I WATCH TITANIC, I COULDN'T WAIT TO BUY THE VIDEO. AND EVERY  THIME I HEAR THE WORD TITANIC IT MAKES ME CRAZY.  TITANIC IS MY FAVORITE  MOVIE.
0792152328|5.0|Titanic has won 11 Oscars including &quot;Best Picture.&quot;  It's tied the score with Ben-Hur, and no other movie could win that many awards. It took over millions of dollars to make this movie, they've put in 3 hours,  and the journey was very incredible.  It was so good that I just had to see  it again and again. It was worth it too, and should be worth 5 stars.  You'll never see another movie as good as this one.
B00000JCB2|1.0|By real music, I mean the Chemical Brothers which comes out the same day as this new horrible cd.  Electronic music rules over hip-hop guitaring trash.
0684867621|1.0|This was the worst book that I've read in a long, long time.  It was so predictable and definantly was a boring ciche.  Even if you do like baseball there was only like three games that Trisha listened to and they  weren't all THAT exciting.  I don't recomend this book to anyone, unless  they need to fall asleep.
6304539282|5.0|You'll hear almost everyday how great and amazing and spectacular Star Wars is, and it's true. It's unavoidable; this is the best movie series ever made, at least to me. Return of the Jedi is my favorite, but I really  liked the other two; there are no boring or stupid parts of the Trilogy.  Even though it isn't included in this pack, I LOVED The Phantom Menace.  Don't listen to the &quot;so-so&quot; reviews that the critics gave it,  what do they know. Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson, and Jake Lloyd are the best,  not to say I didn't like the other people. THIS TRILOGY ROCKS! BUY IT NOW!
B00000F0KC|5.0|This is reallly neat because of the comedy and adventure in it. It has always been my favorite Western.It is a wonderful family movie!
B00000IOSU|5.0|MIRRORBALL does sarah mclachlan true justice.  you won't get the same effect out of her other recorded cd's.  i have seen sarah perform live numerous times and she is amazing.  this cd is a like a little piece of the  concert you get to take home; enjoy and experience again and again.  it  comes highly recommended from a long time devoted sarah fan.  fumblers'  rock!!!!
0425170349|5.0|Undoubtedly, this is certainly one of Clancy's most fast-paced and thrilling novels, his best since THE SUM OF ALL FEARS and RED STORM RISING! Unlike EXEC ORDERS, this one does not get bogged down in unnecessary  subplots which go nowhere. This one concentrates on John Clark, who heads  an international anti-terrorist elite force codenamed RAINBOW. Clark's call  sign is RAINBOW SIX, hence the title. The RAINBOW teams are based in  England.  Anyway, there's three terrorist incidents in Europe the team is called to, a Russian agent shows an interest, and then  we come across a group of eco-nazis who have planned the biggest mass  murder in history to further their selfish causes . . . I won't tell you  the ending but I guarantee it'll make you laugh out loud as the bad guys  and gals got what they deserved! The military action comes thick and fast,  there are some interesting methods of elite forces training and some  awesome gadgets(the people-finder is quite feasible). It may not be as  accurate as the portrayal of the SAS by writers such as Gordon Stevens, and  the true-life stories such as BRAVO TWO ZERO, or a Bob Mayer novel, but  it's such a thrilling ride you cannot help but be swept along by the  intrigue. Highly recommended!
0380973464|5.0|A book that I will probably reread at least twice. Full of brilliances, but in need of some pruning. Our most original SF novelist, but this is NOT Science Fiction. It's a book for very bright people, with a background in  math and computer science. WOW!
6302902010|5.0|It's all good, I also think they should make more movies about musicians life story like the 5 heartbeats, temptations, jacksons etc. I'll buy them all. I'm also a Dee Jay.
068815333X|5.0|After reading and thoroughly enjoying Gone Baby Gone I bought Prayers for Rain to see what these chracters were up to next.  This book is even better.  Great characters, captivating storytelling and so many interesting  twists and turns that every time you think you have it figured out, you're  surprised.  One of the best books I've read.
B00000AFFI|5.0|Britney Spears doesn't even write her own music - Come on! PJ is the best female artist of all time. Buy her albums - your definition of music will change.
0553213105|4.0|Truth be told I had a prejudice against the book even before opening it. I thought it was to be a boring novel with little to keep my attention. To my surprise I could not put it down. The characters had great charisma and  appeal. The tension created between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy was wonderful,  and kept the audience on edge. I have the utmost regards for this novel. I  cannot say enough about this book. It was excellent, a true treasure.
B00000IOSU|5.0|This is the best live album I ever bought!!  &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot;, &quot;I Will Remember You&quot; are excellent tunes.  It is a must-own for all Sarah McLachlan fans.
0871137380|5.0|I read this book in the course of less than two days.  I would advise a reader to read the note on sources at the end of the book first, so you will realize that this book is carefully constructed, and the great amount  of dialogue is not fiction.  This is as close as one can get to real war  sitting in an easy chair reading about it.  If there was a way to give it  ten stars I would.
079283321X|5.0|What can you say about Rocky!It has got to be the most remarkable movie of all time. Nobody could have playe Rocky but Stallone. He should have won best actor but gave a symphty award to Albert Finney. Truly a gem.Movies  2-5 are good but can't compare to the uneducated Rocky 1.Burt Young was  best supporting actor thats how good he was. The fight scenes were great.  Creed looked devistating, Rocky was over match at first but came on in the  later rounds.If for some reason you have not seen this film then BUY IT you  will wan't to see it again and agaain as I have.
6305313687|5.0|My husband and I are both in our 50's and we both wept throughout this movie, and it is not superficially emotional...designed to make you cry. It is just so deeply impacting that it pierces something deep in your psyche  and your spirit. I have not seen a more important motion picture in my  life. Everyone of every racial and political persuasion should be required  to view this film. This makes anything Spike Lee has ever done, look like  idiocy. When a movie like this was out there to be made, a film that truly  addresses the honest racial attitudes of real people, it makes one wonder  wonder why a piece of filth like &quot;He's Got Game&quot; was even allowed  to go into distribution. I hope Spike has seen this one.
B000000OTU|5.0|I've never been able to enjoy mowing lawns, but when i pop this baby in my cd player i could mow til the grass don't grow, Ok that was a dumb saying, but it doesn't change the favt that this cd is one of the few cd's that  doesn't have a dumb song on it! Take my advive and do What it Takes to buy  this album!
0684867621|4.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat.  I thought he developed the little girl's character very well...her remembered conversations with her friend sound like the stuff my neighbor and I talked about 15 years ago.  I'm a baseball  fan and last year's home run race got me through what could have been a  really stressful fall...If I was lost in the woods I'll bet Mark McGuire  would be leading me out!
B000002LKF|5.0|The popular credo about this album is that it can't hold a candle to Graceland. To me, that's just unfair. Graceland is one of the great albums of our time---Simon's tour de force. But Rhythm Of The Saints, judged on  it's own merit, is also a special album. Some of the lyrics on this CD  provoke incredible imagery and the music is just damn good. The South  American influence is very apparent. Take a deep breath, people. Stop the  madness. Just hit PLAY and listen to some fine, toe-tapping music.
0780625129|5.0|I have to echo the sentiments of the viewer from Seattle, WA. My husband and I are both in our 50's and we both wept throughout this movie, and it is not superficially emotional...designed to make you cry.

B00000IO4I|5.0|Little Voice is one of the best movies I've seen....a real &quot;feel good&quot; movie. The performances sparkle, and Jane Horrocks is amazing as LV....very unfortunate that both she and Michale Caine were not given Oscar  nominations. If you want a good time, see Little Voice. A warm, fun movie  that you don't want to see end. Just watch it and enjoy it.
B00000DHRZ|2.0|For all of you out there you love &quot;Pretty Fly&quot; (ugh) and think Americana is the greatest Offspring CD of all time (even though most of you probably have never even heard any of the others, like my younger cousin,  who tried to tell me it was their first), I will enlighten you: Americana  sucks.  Sorry to be so blunt.  Americana is nowhere near as good as Smash  and Ixnay, and if you think Americana is punk rock, you need to do a bit  more research.  I'll admit, there were a few good songs on this CD, but  most were junk.  Unlike Smash, which I got in seventh grade and still  listen to now, I sat through Americana maybe twice before tossing it on the  mess on my floor in disgust (I have a very messy room).  Anyway, for the  hardcore fan, it's a let down, but OK if you have a huge surplus of money.   Or better yet, send some of that surplus to me.
B00000JCB2|1.0|Dont bands like Limp Bizkit and Korn know that they are not breaking any ground ? Biohazard already did the rap/metal thing..these guys think they are original..i think not...this music is horrible..anyone who thinks this  is groundbreaking music should go pierce their eyeballs
B00000DLUV|5.0|A very enjoyable and fun CD.  Slow and fast beat music incorporated in one magical moment giving the listeners to surf it's way to the best harmony of a lifetime. Reminiscing the past and savoring the present of Bee gees music  is all found in this CD.  I encourage everybody to get this CD.  Enjoy!!!
B000001EC1|4.0|Bon Jovi is a band that co-owned the upper half of the 80s. His songs &quot;Livin' On A Prayer&quot; and &quot;You Give Love A Bad Name&quot; remain classics. He did go too soft in the mid-90s when he recorded  &quot;Always&quot; and &quot;This Ain't A Love Song&quot;(not on Cross  Road). But for anybody looking for some good Bon Jovi, this is it.
6304697961|3.0|The three star rating only applies to the DVD, not the film which should get five stars.<br />It is a shame that this really great horror classic was so poorly transfered to DVD. The picture is dark, and seems out of focus.  Also, it has no extra features, just the trailer. I agree with the previous  viewer who wrote that you'd be better off with the VHS version. One of the  few cases where a DVD has gone wrong
B000002UDV|5.0|Absolutely divine...Do we need any other words do describe this incredible &quot;teenager simphony to God&quot;?
B00000INEX|1.0|My 6 month old daughter adores the &quot;Baby Mozart&quot; video and we often have it on during dinner.  It is nice to be able to sit and eat and listen to some pleasing music while the baby is entertained by the bright  colors, interesting toys and soothing music.<br />We were very disappointed  with the &quot;Baby Bach&quot; video which was done by the same people.   The musical selections are jarringly short and not particularly soothing.   There is a loud and annoying chicken in the middle of the video and the  originator's daughter telling goofy jokes.  (Felt like I was watching  someone's home movies.)<br />So ... if you are interested in an entertaining  video for your baby, I highly suggest purchasing &quot;Baby Mozart&quot;  and leaving &quot;Baby Bach&quot; behind.
B00000IOSU|5.0|This is the first time I have listened to one of Sarah's albums and gotten the same powerful emotions generated from listening to her live. She is truly an amazing artist. The closest you can get to the real thing!!! Her  best album yet, by far!! (buy the others too!!)
B00000IOSU|5.0|This CD is sooo great! I have all of her other CD's adn although most of the tracks are on the other albums I would still reccomed you getting this. I always think that there is something speacial about the live performaces  rather than studio reccordings, the songs are slightly different, and you  got the crowd in the background etc, GO AND GET THIS CD!!!!
0553573403|5.0|It had been a long time since I've read a book that I could not put down. Martin's book, A Game of Thrones managed to do that. It captured my imagination with greatly developed characters. I could associate with each  one of them in turn, even the &quot;evil&quot; characters were described in  such great detail, that the reader could always understand where they're  coming from.<br />Overall, a wonderful read. I would recommend it to anyone  (my mother-in-law loved it as well).
0385486804|4.0|Jon Krakauer has been very lucky with his assignments with Outside Magazine.  Granted, getting stuck in a blizzard on Mt Everest isn't what most people would describe as lucky; however, he sure has profitted fom  writing Into The Wild and Into Thin Air.  This book is very well researched  but does tend to drag at points, especially when he brings in his own  personal accounts.  Over all, I would say he's an alright writer who has  benefitted from being at the right place at the right time.  This book is  definitely worth your time.
6302902010|5.0|Add me to the list of people looking for the original Porgy &amp; Bess of the 50's.  It was the best.  Even the live stage version is not as good. Let me know if it is ever available.
B00000JCB2|5.0|After I heard Faith I thought it couldn't possibly be topped as the best song ever. But now that nookie is out i've changed my mind.  If you only buy 1 cd this summer get this one. Fred is the man!
6305499365|5.0|This is one of the funniest films I have ever seen. It captures the frustration, politics and authoritarianism of office life. As the story unfolds it becomes more insane and hilarious. This is a must see for any  office worker. You will never view your day in same way.
0446364495|1.0|Pure garbage. This book was recommended to me by a friend - some friend! The quality of the writing is so POOR, I'm at a loss for words trying to describe it. I'm embarassed to admit I read it.
0792151712|3.0|So this is as it has been called a tragic heartbreaking love story, but hello! It's called titanic we know the boat sinks and I mean if you haven't seen it before and it's the top seller under tragedy you obviously know on  thems gotta die. but that's my critism. my compliment is it's visually  stunning, and the love story was great but it's such an obviously plot. If  you read this and get the impression you shouldn't waste your time but you  want to see a heartbreaking tear jerker whose end is to some degree tragic,  and the film is visually looks great with a good love story, see the  beautiful prescoius and heartbreaking gone with the wind.
6303402348|1.0|The book was actually very funny, but i thought that this moviemanaged to leave out all the good laughs from the book. Read the book,you will enjoy it a lot more.
6300271439|5.0|For anyone who likes Madonna, this movie is the best. She is great as Niki Finn and my favorite part is when she shoots her gun in the car and yells, &quot;I am Niki Finn, I will not be denied!!!&quot; Buy this movie if you  enjoy light and clever comedy
B000002OG5|5.0|This is one of the best if not the best instrumental movie scores ever! The only soundtrack that can equal the &quot;Godfather&quot; is &quot;Star Wars.&quot; The Love Theme is a beautiful song and every time I hear it, I  think of the scene in the movie where Pacino is walking in the mountains of  Sicily.
1567407757|5.0|I THINK THIS BOOK SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING FOR STUDENTS IN HIGH SCHOOL.  THIS BOOK IS PROBABLY THE MOST LOVED BOOK I HAVE READ THIS YEAR.   MITCH ALBOM REALLY HIT HOME WITH HIS TRUE FEELINGS ONE CAN HAVE FOR A RESPECTED  TEACHER.  I TOO HAD A TEACHER LIKE THAT ONCE IN MY LIFE AND I WISH I WOULD  HAVE HAD THE CHANCE TO SPEND HIS LAST YEAR OF LIFE WITH.  HE TOO HAS PASSED  AND I WISH I WOULD HAVE TOLD HIM WHAT HE REALLY MEANT TO ME AS HIS STUDENT  AND HIM AS MY TEACHER.  I LOVED HIM DEEPLY.  THIS PAST FEBRUARY I HAD THE  OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH HIS WIFE.  I TOLD HER THAT HE WAS MY FAVORITE  TEACHER AND THEN SHE SAID HE WAS MINE TOO.  WE BOTH HUGGED AND IT MADE ME  FEEL LIKE SHE KNOWS WHAT AN AFFECT HE HAD ON MY LIFE, AND WHAT A TEACHER  CAN DO FOR HIS STUDENT.
B00000JCB2|5.0|The first CD blew me away.  A bunch of my friends have the boot-leg copy.  They said it's 10 times as good as the first one. All you other Limp Bizkit fans remember  LIMP IS THE PI*P!!!!!!!
6304626495|5.0|I'll refrain from summarizing the plot, as I'm just writing to clear up anti-religious themes.  <br />I, as a member of online Monty Python communities and as a Roman Catholic, do not find it offensive.  I think the  movies political attacks are about the time of Jesus, not about Jesus  himself.  Jesus only makes two appearences, once as a baby, and the other  when he's giving his sermon on the mount.  In this scene, Jesus has nothing  to do with the action, he's just the background character as the rest of  them get into arguments (very funny by the way).  As I said, most jokes are  aimed at the times.  For example, there is a scene where a man is getting  stoned for uttering the name of the Lord, and it just gets incredibly  silly.  <br />In conclusion, I'd just like to say that all of the people that  I've met that find the movie offensive, haven't actually seen it.  That  includes all of the protesters who were marching for a boycott.  Go ahead  and watch it, if you think you'd like it.
6300151379|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies since I was very little, but since then I've lost my copy somewhere. *Sigh* I especially love the little worm who exclaims &quot;If she had gone that way she would have gone straight to  the castle!&quot;<br />It's amazing how many people love this movie. I was at  a picnic the other day and started singing one of the &quot;Dance magic  dance&quot; under my breath, and one of my friends started to sing along!  We serenaded everyone there and although we got some very strange looks  from some people, many of them knew what we were singing about.<br />We can  only wait and hope ...
6305234760|5.0|I was completely overwhelmed with the musical power of this video.  Video and other performance recordings rarely catch a musical performance at its synergistic peak, but this one does.  The only drawback of this particular  filming is the somewhat distracting cuts to major tourist attractions in  the Bejing area during the course of the opera.
B000002UB6|5.0|&quot;Let It Be&quot; is a great album. This album features The Beatles in a rather laid-back style. On this album, they're not trying to be the greatest rock and roll band ever, they're just making music. &quot;Let It  Be&quot; doesn't have the sharp, biting wit of &quot;The Beatles&quot;  (White Album), or the musical eloquence of &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, it just  feels like a band making great music. I believe that was their intent with  this album. The Beatles were trying to 'Get Back' to their roots, to just  being a normal rock and roll band. Even though it's not flashy or glitzy,  this music is every bit as great as the Beatles' other works.
0609603086|2.0|Chiming right in with other reviewers, it is hard to believe that this book was written by the same author as Pillars of the Earth, Night Over Water, Dangerous Fortune and A Place Called Freedom. I can't say that I  didn't find the book at all interesting, even though it was a bit far  fetched.  Although you can't fault an author for trying a new genre, the  book lacks the richness in detail and character that makes his  others such  treasures. I look forward to a return to these qualities in his next book.
B00000JCOV|5.0|I have heard Eyeless, Surfacing and prosthetics and I think they're brilliant
B0000013GT|4.0|OutKast are the Jimi Hendrix of hip hop - they use a variety of cool sounds, combine them with dope beats, and then drop awesome, thought provoking vocals making for a propulsive, intelligent rap album. This one  works your mind even as it gets your hands in the air. &quot;ATliens&quot;  is one of the catchiest songs of all time. &quot;Mainstream&quot; is cool  for the sweet beats and for the flavorful Goodie Mob cameos. Buy this one,  folks.
6302424739|5.0|Ah, the shoe fits...for I too have a similiar relationship, but, hopefully, will meet my friend very soon...this movie was one of the best in context, period research, and complicated thought processing...Hopkins,  as usual, does more than an outstanding job...and Bancroft shows her craft  in the best light.  I recommend this movie to all of us that have always  wondered about relationships that can never be consumated in any way...
B000005IRG|5.0|In particular Marquee Moon is a very good rock-album like noother in this decade. Torn curtain &amp; the title track are the best songs in this album and the guitar-solos are very good.  I love Billy Ficca's drumming and the voice of Verlaine. You can hear the  Coltrane style in the solos, the rock'n'roll, the melody...Marque moon is  PERFECT
0064471837|5.0|This book is one of my absolute favorites!  The characters were very well defined and the plot was wonderful!  I exspecially liked how the story ended with just the right amount of sadness and of hope.  I would recommend  this book to anyone who is a fan of fantasy.
B000001GBJ|5.0|this cd is a must have for everyone who likes relaxing music. When Im listening to this cd I feel like Im flying.
B00000IOSU|4.0|I've been waiting for a &quot;Live&quot; album from Sarah Mclachlan, having seen her in concert. This fills the void, but I have to ask who made the decision to put the bonus disk in the package and only fill it with  three songs? Where are &quot;Vox&quot; and &quot;Into the Fire,&quot; two  songs she did on her tour regularly.
B000002A3T|5.0|Pink Floyd does not have any bad music, but of all their albums, this one is comprised of nothing but awesome tunes; everyone of them is great.  I listened to this CD every day for the first two months after I received it  then it got stolen at work.  I drove to Best Buy to get it again quickly.  This is one of my all time favorite albums; you will be very pleased with  this one.

047158651X|5.0|I have a B.S. in biochemistry and a minor in organometallic chemistry. As a first year graduate student in biochemistry, I think this book is an invaluable reference tool. For anyone that has to have constant access to a  book with all the answers, this is definitely the one. I have always been  satisfied when looking for the information I need.
B000002LVB|5.0|Another classic album from an all-time classic band.  Their other albums grab me more but &quot;Oh!  Sweet Nuthin'&quot; is as great as anything they ever did.  That guitar solo kills me every time!
0684874350|2.0|Just one example of why there are so many different books in the world and so many different people.  Someone is bound to like each particular book but I am not one of them for Angela's Ashes.<br />Yes, I know Frank's family  was poor.   Yes, I know Frank's dad was a drunk.   Did I have to read it on  every single page?
0517122707|5.0|I was notified of the existence of this work by a friend a greatly admire.  Our tastes are usually in sync.  He had recently borrowed a book from the library and was singing its praises to me before he had even finished.   Upon completing the novel he lent it to me.  Trusting I would read and  return said book in the time allotted preventing him from the wrath of the  librarians.     Needless to say, I loved it.  <br />    It is most important  here to note that rarely does someone recommend anything to me I enjoy as  much as them.  Nor have I ever recommended anything to anyone else who  loved it as much as me.     Great book!
014028009X|4.0|Sure, it's not Shakespeare and probably won't be around ten years from now but it is quite funny and a perfect mindless summer read.  I liked it quite a bit!
B00000IOSU|3.0|Sadly a poor performance.  If a rockin' good time live performance is what you're looking for it, unfortunately, won't be found here.  What starts off with a hot version of &quot;Building A Mystery&quot; quickly turns cold for  the fan of live music.  With only a few notable cuts, if good music is  what's wanted you'll be better pressed to find it in original mix versions.   Main problem is that songs are slowed down and don't have the spontaneous  live feel with absolutely no banter except for one moment of chorus in Ice  Cream with screaming audience straight out of a Beatles concert.  You can  sense this was a show meant for CD rather than to please an audience.   Don't get me wrong, Sarah, Band and recording quality are in great form and  CD should be purchased for true fan's collection.  BUT if a good show is  what you want stick with Alice (in chains)!!!
0800193334|1.0|Ridiculous as it is that this movie was even made put aside, it desecrates the brilliance of the novel. I place DeVito in the same category as The Trunchbull. Please read the book.
0684867184|4.0|Stephen Ambrose is an excellent writer and historian.  I love all of his work!!.  The best part about this book are his experiences in Whitewater, WI.  He is revered in this town because of what his father and family have  given this city.  My only problem with the book is Ambrose recycles a lot  of material (see Kirkus review) from his previous books.  The stories about  his relationship with his Father is excellent reading. Dr. Ambrose  was an  outstanding person!!. Comrades does not stack up to previous books but if  you are an Ambrose fan like myself... it is worth the money. This is not  his best work but it does outshine other books I have read this year.
B000006NPY|3.0|They're capable of much better work than this. Just because this record is personal (or seems like it...lyrics are too incoherent) doesn't make it a masterpiece. There's too much filler, too much left in the open. Corgan was  never a genius with melodies, and this record shows it.<br />People are better  off buying Mutations by Beck. The tone of the two records are the same -  folky, depressing, dark, introspective. The only differences is that Beck  is a genius with melodies and the lyrics are more substantial. This isn't a  bad album, it just doesn't stand out too much
0812523334|1.0|I tried reading this book first when I was five, with my mom, then when I was twelve. It was horrible each time. I remember distictly suffering through it up to the part where Meg makes jam, then deciding it wasn't  worth my time. My mom hated it each time she read it too.<br />The movie,  however, with Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon, is very good. If you want to  know the story and not suffer, see the movie, which is quite good.
B00000DHRX|5.0|The best dance and ballad music their is. What a CD
B0000029GA|5.0|i think this album marks the beginning of a great person's life- no album has struck me like this one, but then again he keeps coming back at you like it was written and i am all i can say is that the guy is for real and  i love the man he is so deeply talented that it blows my mind what an  artist... Nasir Jones
B00000IOSU|5.0|We all know that Sarah is an AWESOME live performer but this c.d. presents some of her best performances.  Just about all of my favorites are here!!!!  All I can say is what an amazing voice!
6303832563|5.0|I saw this once, probably back in the '80's, when I rented a copy from a video store and now find it hard to be around, although located a local store to rent it from here in Tucson, AZ just yesterday. I sure would like  to get to the bottom of why it's no longer being made and available. I  recall the splendid way the camera went from the natural scenery to the  hustle &amp; bustle of the cities using slow-motion &amp; fast-motion  cinemaphotography, particularly of the rocket launch and the moonrise. Just  an awesome documentary showing God's creation contrasting with man's  creation, the 'life out of balance' paradox!! Is there a conspiracy here in  supressing the availabilty of something with such powerful imagery?
0792151712|5.0|I never had a favorite movie until Titanic.   From beginning til end you will be captured by   this great story.
B000002UV1|5.0|Easily the Peppers' best album, &quot;MM&quot; blew me away when I first heard it a decade ago and continues to rock my world.  Not even &quot;Blood Sugar...,&quot; a superb album in its own right, matches the passion, the  raw energy, the funk, the attitude or the fire of &quot;Mother's  Milk.&quot;  I wish the Peppers had continued in this vein rather than the  dull, tired-sounding band they have since become.  &quot;Mother's  Milk&quot; will always be my first love.
0380002930|5.0|No wonder so many people are going to homeschooling now; if these comments are indicative of what public schools are turning out now, then I say tear 'em all down.  There's really nothing left for American 'culture' now but  waiting for the fall.
0451160916|5.0|This is Stephen King's best novel
079213690X|5.0|I enjoyed the speacial effects and the story ,the sound was exhilerating.I hope it comes out on DVD soon ,this movie deserves to be put on DVD.
B000002KKX|5.0|I agree with the other reviewer that this an album of fantastic 70/80's pop music.  Every other song on this album was a top ten hit for Christopher Cross, and it's easy to see why.  This is a great album to sit  back and relax to.
B000001GQR|5.0|The Schubert is simply awe-inspiring.  Furtwangler is the man
B0000025NU|5.0|This is one of the best live albums I have ever heard!  If you are a true Billy Joel fan and you don't have this album, you are missing one of the best Billy Joel albums in the whole collection. Favorites of mine include,  &quot;Ballad of Billy the Kid&quot; and &quot;Miami 2017.&quot;  I have to  agree with other  critics here that &quot;Angry Young Man&quot; should have  been included. But I still pick this CD over most of the Billy Joel albums  in my collection.
B000002B38|4.0|I cant beleiev all the complaints about crowd noise. It's a LIVE CD people! If you dont like the singalong (which I hate too) and crowd noise dont buy a LIVE CD.. by anyone. Buy the studio versions. This is not a  greatest hits cd. Anyway , I felt this was a good sounding CD with an above  average performance by Floyd. If I didnt know Roger Waters was gone  beforehand I wouldnt have known anyway. They are mostly songs he has  written but I dont know how I would notice him gone from the actual  performance of them. He was 1 of a group which is still together .
B000001F75|5.0|Boasting both the definitive Jim Fitzpatrick cover and a diverse lineup of outstanding compositions, &quot;Vagabonds&quot; is easily one of Thin Lizzy's three finest studio albums (&quot;Black Rose&quot; and &quot;Bad  Reputation&quot; fill out that triumvirate for this listener). Suffering at  times from spare production values, the album still offers a testament to  the band's instrumental virtuosity: under-appreciated guitarist Eric Bell  is a particular standout, displaying a range running from Beck-like  eruptions on &quot;Black Boys...&quot; and &quot;The Rocker,&quot; to  gritty, authentic blues breaks on &quot;Slow Blues&quot; and &quot;Broken  Dreams,&quot; to an astonishing pseudo-flamenco feature on &quot;Randolph's  Tango.&quot; He was also the only credible slide player in Lizzy's axeman  pantheon, as &quot;Mama Nature Said&quot; illustrates.  &quot;Vagabonds&quot; also displays, to fine advantage, Philip Lynott's  uncanny way with a lyric. Lynott also came into his own as a vocalist on  this album, after his occasionally dodgy performances on the band's first  two platters. The title track and &quot;Gonna Creep Up On You&quot; beg to  be covered by a contemporary act (Metallica recently released a cover of  the Lizzy-fied &quot;Whisky in the Jar&quot;). &quot;Vagabonds,&quot;  paired with &quot;Black Rose,&quot; offers a forthright homage to Lizzy's  Irish origins. Fans of later Lizzy sometimes find the offerings of  proto-Lizzy to be sketchy and diffuse. However, any fan who likes the 1981  album &quot;Renegade&quot; should give &quot;Vagabonds&quot; a listen. The  earlier disc displays the same diversity of approach as the latter, and the  band's musical vision is much more successful (in my opinion) on  &quot;Vagabonds.&quot;
B000002HHB|4.0|If you're torn between which CD to buy my suggestion is to get Ophelia.  I purchased it first, and am glad I did.  This one has more &quot;radio play&quot; but it's just not as good over-all.
6301562925|4.0|In halloween 4 we thought Michael was killed and we all were suprized by the ending with jamie. In this installment we find out that the only reason that Jamie attacked her sister is because Michael was trying to contact  her(with E.S.P). If you like halloween 4 than you most likley will like  this movie. in my opinion the first movie still is better.
B0000027RL|5.0|I am not writing a review, but rather, asking a request.  I need the lyrics for &quot;Black.&quot;  I've tried listening to it several times, and I understand most of it, but I'm having trouble with words here and  there throughout the song.  If someone would be willing to share them, that  would be great.  Thanks!
B000000H3W|5.0|After the solid thrash classic Beneath the Remains, Sepultura made a big step forward with Arise.  The songs on this album are more focused, have more variety, and they're more structured, and less free-flowing.  The  production makes the sound clearer but most of all, this album is Sepultura  at the top of their game.  All the ones that would follow would be  inferior.
6304331185|1.0|I can't believe that anyone with a second-grade education couldn't see right through this piece of trash.  It is the most painfully obvious movie gimmick in history.  The acting is absolutely uninspired, especially by the  absolutely inept Kevin Spacey, who joins Keanu Reeves and Brad Pitt as the  Three Stooges of Bad Nineties Actors.<br />Basically, a movie for those morons  whose idea of thought provoking entertainment is the X-Files.
B00000IL1K|5.0|Sarah just hooks you in and keep you listening and begging for more.   i'm on track to look for more of her new cds. this is a must if u are into classical opera to enigma.
0790729989|1.0|How anyone could watch this film and still speak of a surprise ending is completely beyond me.  It was completely predictable, boring, and overly concerned with it's own cleverness.  <br />And isn't it about time that  someone told Brad Pitt to give up on the acting and just become an  underwear model?  His rather sad attempts at acting are getting  increasingly pathetic, never more so than in this drab waste of time and  money.
B00000IOSU|5.0|When Sarah was just a small presence in the world of music, I listened.  Trembling and weeping with every beautiful note she gave to me.  She held my hand through the rough times in my life and still insists on seeing me  through those days when I feel I'm going to break.  I prayed every night  that one day she would be discovered by the world and finally receive the  acclaim she deserves.  Sarah possesses me.  She is an unceasing knocking at  my door.  Even with a complete collection of her works in my possession, I  still hunger for more.  This collection is yet another menagerie of bliss.   Without it, you're missing the essence of Sarah.  To love is to know Sarah  McLachlan.  And if Lillith Fair is beyond your grasp, buy this CD, close  your eyes, and immerse yourself in the closest thing to heaven here on  Earth.
B00000J6AG|5.0|This CD is incredible, and it gets better with every listening. The music will blow you away. My favorites are Porcelain, Why does my heart feel so bad? and Inside. The essays are great, too.
B000001Y16|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS LYRICALY THE SICKEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME. NO ONE IN THE GAME CAN PUT YOUR MIND TO THE TEST LIKE PAC. THE ALBUM UNBELIEVABLE. PEACE..........KASH
6304169558|3.0|Very good special-effects, except for the debris parts that were almost always the same size. I do believe that the flood of data from something like their apparatus would take a rather large computer to contain, as well  as collect. Amazing. Often, when 2 women confront each other and are wearing the  same item of clothing it tends to bring out the catty side of their  personalites. Hollywood Hype
B0000028M7|4.0|I don't quite understand the comparisons between AIC and Soundgarden or Nirvana or Pearl Jam.  It's sort of like comparing Hendrix to Pearl Jam just because of geography.  The musical geography mapped out on this record  is much closer to Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin.  The influence of those  two 70's bands on Alice in Chains is so obvious, and yet the album could  never be considered plagiarism in any way.  What AIC did was take a  philosophy of music, namely to force down the throat of the listener all  the anger, pain, angst, and fight of youth and make it taste Oh So Good.  These guys write phenomenal hard rock songs for a new generation.  They  have taken what began in the 70's and got lost in the eighties and brought  it to life for the 90s.  Groups like Night Ranger desecrated the name of  heavy metal in the 80s and it lay there dying until it was resurrected, not  by Pearl Jam or Nirvana, but by Alice in Chains.  Bravo!  Rooster is the  obvious &quot;hit&quot; of this album because it has more mass appeal than  the others, but I don't know if I've ever heard a more powerful beginning  to a song than Them Bones (with the possible exception of Zeppelin's  &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot;), and talk about a closer, Would is just  phenomenal.  I'm 36 but when I listen to this record, I'm 17 again.
0767817478|4.0|This is a somewhat new twist on the Godzilla theme. Instead of undecypherable mouthings in Japanese, it largely takes place in English (?) speaking New York City, a rather good place to destroy, in its pursuit of a  nest.
B000001G16|5.0|I enjoy listening to all kinds of music, from Rap to Opera, Country, to Heavy Metal, but when all is said and done, this CD has had more time in my cd player than any other in my collection.  I highly recommend it.  This  one is definately in my top 10 all time favorite CD's.
B00000J8EK|5.0|this is an amazing album.  how is it that the chemical brothers consistently produce amazing music?  are they just that down w/ the time?  or do they set the time?
0060920084|5.0|The previous reviewers who gave this book 1 or 2 stars are, I noticed, either really full of themselves or they're from the midwest....the very place Bryson *really* socks it to.  I spent far too many years in the  midwest and I've gotta say Bryson is RIGHT ON THE MONEY!  Hilariously  cynical in all the right ways.  Yeah, if you're a &quot;serious armchair  traveller,&quot; you might wanna pass on this one.  However, if you  appreciate a twisted, off color sense of humor....GO FOR IT!!!  You will  NOT be disappointed!!  And did I mention it's FUNNY?!
0451169514|5.0|I'm only fourteen years old, and I read IT. I thought it was the best book that i have ever read. Then i saw the movie. I was horribly upset by it. The book was 100x better than the movie. So for all of you who did like the  movie, read the book so you know the whole story.
B00000JCB2|2.0|Well, first of all, I drove 2 hours just to buy this album. It was one of the most worthless trips I have made. What happened? This one has nothing of what made the first album kick. I love Limp Bizkit, but I don't have any  clue where they thought they were going with this album. What I think is  they see the popularity and hey!, let's put out an album everyone will  like. Where's the raw, edgy power? Maybe it will get them on TRL if that's  what they are going for. Look at the other artists on there. A great  group!?? The songwriting is quite bad. I should've known when Carson Daly  loved this album. Maybe I'm being too hard on them after a few listens and  maybe I'll grow to like it. This album comes nowhere close to the original.  It shouldn't be the same, but it should bring the noise. I think I'll file  this under easy listening.
B00000JCB2|5.0|I think this CD will deffinently be better than three dollar bill,yall$ because they wrote lots of different tunes for this album and Don't Go Off Wandering is a great song.
B000006045|5.0|This is a trip hop collection item, the new vocal Lisa has a increditable voice.  All songs are lay out perfectly, lots of layer and switching.  With a bit of Indian influence.
B00000JCB2|5.0|if you like country you'll love em!! NOT!!! fu*k the rest buy this bad bo
6305282927|1.0|Even though I was in the musical, I still  think this is one of the most boring and trite musicals ever written.  The music, for the most part, is good though, so just buy the soundtrack.
6304331851|5.0|Some critics claim the Richard Burtoon/Julie Andrews stage version is better? No way. I've heard the soundtrack to the play and it is just that, a play. Burton shouts out the words (to be heard in a theatre setting),  over-gestures, and you can't see the faces up close. The songs in the film  are ACTED. The film version zooms in on our heroes' dynamic features and  subtle glances. Superb acting from Harris and Redgrave. Nero is heroically  handsome. When the queen drops to her knee before Lancelot my heart lept to  my throat. I LOVE this movie!
0783221622|5.0|It is too hard to determine which Deniro film is the best Deniro film.  What with such films as The Taxi Driver, The Deer Hunter,Cape Fear, Goodfellas, A Bronx Tale, Heat, Mary Shelly's Frankenstein and Casino, not  to forget other films of his, all these under his sleeve, he truly is one  of the best actors ever.  CASINO CAN NOT BE SEEN ANYWHERE ELSE WITHOUT  WIDESCREEN.  This film was a treat in the Theater.  Now I watch it over and  over again.  This film should take up four tapes, be even better.
0380789019|1.0|I always assumed Sandman owed it's greatness to Gaiman's writing, and logically assumed his novel would be similarly compelling. Not so! His editor should find a new line of work...there are several cringingly awful  sentences. I can ignore that sort of thing if the story is suspenseful, but  Gaiman failed me there too. On the whole it reads like something a young  boy might write in junior high. Every character was utterly two  dimensional. In fact, the only two that were even remotely interesting were  the villains, who were comfortably evil and somewhat amusing. The main  characters were just abysmal...Richard was beyond foolish, and Door had no  substance beyond a great name and predictably &quot;pixie-ish&quot; looks.  That said, I'm sure Neverwhere would make a great graphic novel. It reads a  bit like a hastily conceived storyboard, so perhaps Gaiman was unable to  step outside of that mindset. (For an excellent graphic novel, try Cages by  Dave McKean.)<br />Verdict: Gaiman is, like Richard, fully &quot;out of his  depth.&quot;
6305161976|5.0|I have seen Casablanca dozens of times -- the script's lines have been incorporated into our language like Shakespeare's.  But watching this DVD is a like seeing the movie for the first time -- the clarity and crispness  is stunning.  I have to comment on those who say this story is  &quot;predictable.&quot;  In fact, as the making-of documentary shows, the  actors themselves did not know how the story would end -- it was being  rewritten while shooting was already going on.
B000002UAI|3.0|Not by any means a classic Beatles album, it's really one that only die-hard fans will want to own  - and that, only for its better moments. Among these are 'Eight Days a Week', which I still think is an early high  point in the Fab Four's career; 'No Reply', which is a charming but gangly  Lennon-McCartney collaboration, and the pretty fair 'I'll Follow the Sun',  'Baby's in Black' and 'What You're Doing'. I seriously LOVE the cover  version of 'Mr. Moonlight', but people keep putting me in this tight white  jacket when I say that. (Am I the only person on this planet who thinks  it's good? I am? ... oh well, never mind...) Unfortunately, the other cover  versions on the album are poor, especially 'Honey Don't' - attempted  (murder) by Ringo - and George doing in the Carl Perkins standard  'Everybody's Trying to be My Baby'. <br />Fortunately, Messrs. Lennon and  McCartney (and the rest of the world) soon discovered that the Beatles were  better at originals than as a cover band. And the rest is rock history.  <br />I know a lot of people regard this album as the nadir of the Beatles'  career, but it wasn't. That historic moment occurred sometime in 1969 when  Sir Paul McCartney sat down at a piano at Abbey Road studios, opened his  mouth, and yowled 'The looong and winding road / tha-aa-aaa-t leads to your  door...' into the microphone.<br />I say the varlet should pay with his  knighthood, your Majesty.
B0000027I6|5.0|Like his work with Floyd, this masterpiece is ahead of it's time. It's nearly perfect.
B000002UAU|4.0|From time to time, music magazines like to do polls - whether of readers or critics - with titles like 'The Best 100 / 50 / 25 Albums of All Time' (and with the new century coming up in about six months' time, we'd better  brace ourselves for a whole slew of 'Albums of the Millennium'  features.)<br />'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts' Club Band' usually tops the  list; if it doesn't, you'll find it somewhere in the top five. 'A milestone  both for 60's music and popular culture' is the conventional wisdom. But  it's a reputation that the album ill deserves. The great myth is that 'Sgt  Pepper' is somehow revolutionary; yet all it does, in the main, is tap into  well-established 20th century musical traditions. But affectionate parody,  even when it's made as charming as the Beatles make it on songs like 'When  I'm Sixty-Four', isn't breaking new ground. So what is it that makes 'Sgt.  Pepper' special? 'The first concept album in the history of rock?' Hardly.  (What's the concept, anyway? As John Lennon rightly pointed out, the title  track sets up a premise that vanishes into thin air all the way down to the  reprise.) <br />Come on, now. Put your hand on your heart and honestly say  that 'Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite', 'Fixing a Hole', or 'Good  Morning, Good Morning' belong anywhere on a list of the Beatles' finest  songs. (I won't insult your intelligence by throwing 'Within You, Without  You' into the pot.) So it's impossible for an album to be good all the way  through, you say. But didn't 'Revolver' almost pull off that feat? And,  yeah, there's more weak material on the 'White Album' than on 'Sgt. Pepper'  - but then, a pared-down, one-LP version of 'The Beatles' would surely beat  'Sgt. Pepper', which boasts only three genuinely outstanding  tracks,  measured by Beatles standards, and maybe two pretty good ones. <br />Lose 'A  Day in the Life', 'With a Little Help From My Friends' and 'Lucy in the Sky  with Diamonds', and look carefully at what's left: music that's merely  excellent from a group that was capable of the sublime. Buy it? of course  you should buy it.
6304078145|5.0|this movie is really a far shot from most boring norm flicks. i simply love it and for the one 2 reviews below i always say people that say you need to grow up have a lot of growing up to do. open your mind and enjoy a  great film, not for your disney collection!
6305265496|5.0|This was a refreshing realistic revision of the original fairy tale.  Or was the fairy tale a revision of the original story?  You decide.  This was one of the best romantic movies next to &quot;You've Got Mail&quot; that I  have seen in a while.  It had all the tragedy and triumph of a true love  story and none of the violence and foul language that so often masks the  messages of our movies today.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film and will  watch it again and again.
B00000J8EK|5.0|First off i have to agree with a reviewer down the way, &quot;as you listen you start to realize that all other music is petty and unoriginal&quot;!! THAT'S THE TRUTH! Never before has ANY other band moved  me in the way the brothers can! It TRULY can't be categorized into a  certain genre... it's just POWERFUL! Buy this cd... it will change your  life.
B00000FCBC|5.0|great versions of old songs! man, even it this aint metallica's music, it sounds great.  Its them gettin back to their roots, and it kicks some fatass!  Not as good as their self-named album, but still really cool.
B000007WO6|5.0|Even if you never heard anything by Joe Satriani, once you heard him you will be hooked. He is unlike any guitar player out there- and considering he started playing the day Jimmi Hendrix died, I think that shows just what  kind of indivdual he is. Joe is the ULTIMATE in guitar players as far as I  am concerned. Once you have heard him you won't be able to get his catchy  ballads out of your head. He is like an addiction - always wanting more.  Wonderful CD to own!
0060977493|1.0|I couldn't get past the first few chapters. The author simply smothers the reader with details and persists in being clever with language, simply for the sake of being clever. This story could have been told in 5 chapters.  A  sham. Bogus.  A waste of time.
B000007T1M|5.0|If you haven't yet heard the album, you might be shocked to discover the powerful expression, originality, and the sheer genius. Listen to any track on it and notice how it broadens your experience.
B000001ABD|5.0|I think that this CD best compiles the most popular songs of Stevie Wonder. I never knew how many people have redone his songs until I heard these CDs. Stevie Wonder's ballads are the greatest. There won't ever be  another artist like Stevie Wonder-so deep and sincere in emotion. None of  that superficial stuff that you hear today. His music is pure soul.
B00000JCB2|5.0|I'm a big LBC fan, and this cd is quality.  It actually shows musical talent (unlike the first cd which was very hard core, but not very musically complex).  This cd isn't as all around hard core as the first cd,  but I can't stop listening to it.
0380973464|5.0|Like all of neals books this one is a sure bet. if you liked the diamond age(kicked a--) then your sure to love this one. the characters are real and full(like zodiac), much better than snow crash and sure to be the start  of a great epic.
1573226521|4.0|While reading the book you can see everything in front of you as if you were really there. This is not something that happens to me often. I couldn't put the book down and even read it on my break at work. The end  was a bit disapointing ( a bit far fetched). But the rest was the best.

6304683960|5.0|&quot;Return to Paradise&quot; is the better of the two Styx videos that are available on Amazon.com.  There is considerable less theater and more music than on &quot;Caught in the Act&quot;.  The band also seems more  tight and enthusiastic, which is probably due to their excitement at being  back together (DeYoung, Shaw, Young and C. Panozzo that is) for the first  time in about a dozen years.  The songs flow well from one to the other,  which is hard to do given Styx' musical variety (sacchrine-laced ballads to  hard-charged rockers). My only criticism is that Dennis DeYoung tries to  add what he probably considers flare to the songs (especially Grand  Illusion) which doesn't work for me.  Otherwise, a good video for the Styx  fan's collection.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Rarely am I treated to such an eclectic mixture of sounds: soul, rock, rap, blues, instrumental, &quot;PLAY&quot; is a moving sometimes irritating (!) but always entertaining blend of sounds, tones and beats. I loved it!
6305470448|5.0|Shakespeare In Love is an amusing comedy drama. Never have I seen Gwyenth Paltrow act as good as this before, especially Judi Dench who played a good part of being queen. I also liked the shows they had on stage. Shakespeare  In Love is a movie you don't want to miss.
0375707972|4.0|What's the difference between a &quot;romance&quot; novel and a well-written story of people in loving and unloving situations? I believe it's the language and the images constructed for the reader. You know from  the reviews that the Pilot is not all he seemed to be, and the immediate  other life is not hard to imagine. What is especially well-drawn about this  particular picture is the sincere emotion and the ways of dealing--or not  dealing--with difficult revelations and complications. I began this just  before a weekend, and found myself carrying it with me wherever I went. I  enjoyed it thoroughly. For anyone who thinks they're secure in what they  know about their partner.
0385493800|5.0|My neighbor ran over with her just finished copy of The Testament. I couldn't put this book down. I came to Amazon.com to buy my own copy for loaning out.  The Testament touched me deeply because Grisham has always  written to entertain. In The Testament, he shares his heart &amp; soul with  his readers, a privilege that is well earned.  Also appreciated that people  of faith were respectfully treated in the hands of a secular author. If you  are on a journey of faith, The Testament may inspire you to continue. If  you are sure of your faith, you will want to own a copy.  Better than the  &quot;Christian&quot; fiction selections, but not overbearing.
6304613199|5.0|This movie is interesting, exciting and entertaining. Jeff Goldblum heads a team of well meaning scientists going to another dinosaur infested island. However things take a down side when a rival team (this one  consisting of hunters) lands on the island and disturbs the islands  delecate ecosystem sending both peaceful and destructive carnivors on a  brutal rampage. The acting is true, the story is painfully standard, but  the truly interesting thing about this movie is it shows the fabulous CGI  dinosaurs everybody remembers from the first film, and puts them into a  remarkably horrific truly prehistoric natural habitat. The begining of the  film (with a little girl being attacked on the islands beach by the  nightmarish Compsagnathus') set's the decidedly darker tone. The films  climax, displaying one of the films T-Rex's on the loose in San Diego, is  one of the high points of excitement. Dinosaur moments include an angry  Stegesour herd, a crazed Triceretops destroying the hunters' camp, Compy's  chomping on a mean hunter, the male and female Rex's breaking in on the  groups' camp, and a mini finale with a pack of Velociraptors stalking the  hunters in a field of tall grass. Julianne Moore is Sarah Harding, Pete  Postlewaite is Roland Tembo, Arliss Howard is Peter Ludlow, Vince Vaugn is  Nick Van Owen, Venessa Lee Chester is Kelly Malcolm, Thomas F. Duffy is  Robert Burke, Peter Storemare is Dieter Stark, Richard Schiff is doomed  Eddie Carr, and Harvey Jason is Tembo's partner Ajay Sidhu. Special visual  effects by Stan Winston, Dennis Muren, Micheal Lantieri, Randall M. Dutra,  and Ned Goreman. Directed by Steven Speilberg.
0553275569|4.0|After reading this book I found that I had learned what I wanted to learn:  about the history and sociology of the early US manned space program.  I am not a fan of Wolfe's off-hand, gee-whiz, overbearing style.  However, I  must admit that this style was very effectively applied in this work. I  checked up on some facts with more pure historical sources, and found that  Wolfe's presentation was accurate--though of course I checked only a tiny  percentage of what's in the book.  Many of the tales seem to me to be  apocryphal or just historical fiction.  But overall the book succeeds in  putting the Mercury program in the context of the times (policically and  sociologically) and rest of the test flight program.  As such it is quite  an achievement.
B000002C1Z|5.0|The Pink Floyd are well known today as pioneers of interstellar music, but with Animals they proved that they could come &quot;home&quot; with their planetary findings.  Animals obviously has similarities with George  Orwell's Animal Farm, but while his book was a good treaties, it lacked an  awe inspirering soundtrack.  Enter, Pink Floyd circa 1977.  Whether you  like the darkness, the intellectualism, the moral messages, or the cute  little flying pig, Animals has a quality most people will find they like.   But, the most powerful statement this album makes is the fact that it shows  Pink Floyd at their most collaborative hight of musical excellance, it was  to be their last truely combined effort along side Dark Side of the Moon  and Wish You Were Here.  And perhaps the theme with Animals is that much  more understandable than with these other great albums.  Simplicity, is  Pink Floyds secret weapon.  Just look, they have this consiced down to  really only three songs with a short intro and conclusion.  And yet, with  these few down-to-earth themes, they are able to take us where they always  have been able to better than any other band....away.
B00000JCB3|5.0|Its a great cd I strongly suggest u buy i
B00000DHRZ|1.0|One of the critics below said that &quot;Punk's not dead&quot; - ARE YOU STUPID OR JUST DEAF?!? If this piece of crap is the comeback that punk is making... then punk would be better off dead. My god, I heard that this was  kind of good. Hah! This is one of the worst pieces of &quot;art&quot; that  I've ever heard. I could record myself going to the bathroom and it would  be more entertaining and listenable... or maybe just banging on the piano  with the background noises of my little cousin banging on the  drums...<br />ALL OF THE SONGS SUCK!!!!!!! THEY REALLY DO.<br />&quot;Pretty  Fly&quot; was cool for a while - but now it sucks. &quot;Why Don't You Get  A Job&quot; always sucked. If another single off this album becomes popular  - I'll cry. <br />DO NOT BUT THIS ALBUM. <br />I WOULD GIVE IT NEGATIVE STARS IF  I COULD. Believe it or not, this is worse than the terrible whining and  moaning of journal entries on Alanis's new album.<br />AVOID THIS AT ALL  COSTS. ALL IT DOES IS TAKE UP SPACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000001E7V|3.0|There are only 2 good tracks on this album: 1 BLACK STEEL which has Tricky's girlfriend reciting a portion of CHUCKY D'd Public Enemy Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos. 2.  I'm BRAND NEW you are RETRO, very good but  way too short.  The rest is too weird and therefore WACK.

B000003AEB|5.0|Best rap CD ever made
B0000027I6|5.0|In the carreer of Roger Waters, so many albums stand out and apart from main stream music of thier time.  Because of this, it is hard to compare Amused to Death with any other album, not even prior works by Waters with  or without the Pink Floyd.  Many say that Dark Side of the Moon is his  best, and I argue that it was Pink Floyds best, not Waters.  Some say it  was The Wall, but this was a special endever, that was simply the first  step towards his solo carreer.  Every artist must improve himself as he  creates, save he grow board with his abilities.  Add in an uncalculatable  amount of vision, and you see that Waters has reached yet another plateau  with Amused to Death.  I look forward to new work from this visionary  artist, and if Amused to Death were to be the last, then I would applaud  him respectfully as a true revolutionary in the music of our time.
B00000DHRZ|1.0|This sucks. The intro to the song &quot;Americana&quot; is cool. Not one good song.<br />rating: F
B000002L7Y|5.0|I've always loved A-Ha and not just &quot;Take On Me.&quot;  I had the tape as a youngster, but I finally got the CD.  I can't believe I waited so long to do it!  It's so easy to get lost in the mix of the music and the  words just help transport you there.  If you like 80's music, this album is  a definite must have!!!
0380789019|5.0|This book was fantastic!  It twisted reality and fantasy around and around each other, until, like the main character of the book - the reader begins to think &quot;ah, that could happen.&quot;  I would recommend this book to  anyone who misses books that could raise goosebumps, without including so  much sex or gore as to make one sick.  This was a great read.
0425152251|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  It really made me think.  Many books new books today are read, but no real thinking is done.  This book makes you question the reality everones walks on.  Not only did a learn much about  philosophers, but the story was wonderful.  I have read comments on how the  plot was underdevoloped, but i believe that if thats your opinion (and  everyones entitled to there own opinion) that you didn't understand the  book.  I now think in a different way.  This book has influenced my life in  a major way.  I have a whole new way of understanding from this book.  This  bok was thought - provoking.  After the first 10 pages, a put down the  book, and thought deeply about the strong words written on these pages.  I  love this book and reccomend it to everyone who has a goal in life.
B00000DHRZ|1.0|Boy, are you dumb. My brother got this and he hated it so he gave it to me. I hate it too. I think that I'm going to burn it. You know, putting CD's in the microwave is really cool. This album definitely deserves a  place in there with all of the America Online discs that we get all of the  time... <br />AVOID THIS. Trust me.
B00000J2KT|2.0|I beleive this movie to be one of the best released on the Vietnam war.  (Except for one scene including a high voiced annoying superior downtalking to the young journalist above a grave. Talk about an uninspiring speech!)   I have to leave the room durring this scene each time i hear that mans  voice.  My highest criticism is simple though:  Why no letterbox?  I have  DVD mostly because I can see movies the way they were made to be seen.   Without letterbox this movie is still going to lack its theatrical power  that I remember.  I urge the makers to look at releasing this film in the  correct format.  Without letterbox this movie is not worth purchase.  I  just assume wait.
B000002KM6|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST ROCK RECORDS EVER!! IT TAKES ME BACK TO WARM SUMMER EVENINGS, CRUISIN' IN DOWNTOWN L.A. BACK IN THE EARLY '80's. A TOTAL MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE FOR ANY REASON!!!
0440219078|5.0|I first read The Giver when it came out in hard back, I was in the seventh grade and my teacher lent it to me.  I had read many of Lois Lowry's books before, but I was completely unprepared for how wonderful this book was.   When I finished I turned immediately to the first page and re-read it.  I  recieved my own copy as a present soon after, and I have read it more times  than I can remember.  This is a book for everyone.  My mother and her  reading group also read it and loved it.  I gave it to my history teacher  for Christmas, and she read it in one sitting.  It is my favorite book,  even after 6 years, and I would recommend it to anyone, young or old.
B000001DTM|5.0|Possibly the most unique collection of music on one CD that I have ever heard.  The boys from Dublin have outdone themselves this time.  From powerful songs like 'Mysterious Ways' to quieter songs like 'Acrobat', the  music just moves through your body yelling &quot;Lucy, I'm home!&quot;   <br />In true form, U2, headed by the ever so handsome Bono, have managed to  take some 'off-key' and hard edged songs straight over the top.  If you  haven't heard or don't own this album, you should drop everything that you  are doing and either run to the store or click on the order button from  Amazon.com so that you can live in the style that so many other U2 fans  have become accustomed.  Don't deprive yourself any longer.  You only live  once.
B0000062GK|5.0|Mr. Satriani takes the guitar into a truly divine explosion of passion and energy on this CD.  It is very hard to impress me on the guitar, but Joe just leaves me spell bound!  For the guitarist and layman alike, Satriani  delivers quality.  One can tell that he pursues his instrument with the  efforts of a true hero.  My compliments and congratulations to Mr.  Satriani.
6304132271|5.0|It's a rare phenomenon. The combination of plot, dialogue, characterisation, look, feel, sound, music, acting etc does not always gel as well as it did here. An amazing film, all the more because of how the  script made it to production in its original form. Apparently the standard  creatively bankrupt suit-brigade got their hands on the script &amp; made  it more user-friendly, but Brad Pitt, having been sent the original by  mistake, threatened to withdraw until the original was returned to its  rightful position. Goodonya!

0792837983|4.0|I recently watched the movie Happiness, which centers in on a pedophile very closely.  Watching that movie from start to finish left me feeling kind of like a pedophile myself...Incredibly disturbed and shameful.  Anyway, I couldn't help but notice that I was nursing similar feelings as I  watched Lolita.  Luckily, I realized some time into the film that there was  more to this man's obsession than that-distracting albeit-aspect...And my  apprehensive feelings were on a low-heat anyway thanks to the AMAZING  performances throughout, not to mention some nice dialouge and surreal  humor. It wasn't until Humbert was in his full blown neurosis; his total  and complete desperate obsession for his &quot;nymphet&quot; that I  realized he wasn't just some pervert.  His need for Lolita was a force that  he built up so profusely in his mind, that it encompased every hope, want,  need and desire imaginable to him-past, present and future...A great  dillusion in other words, but not a seething perversion, which was my  initial assumption. <br />All around, Lolita was a very thought-provoking  movie and in the end, touching. I felt incredible sadness for Humbert, who  lost a lot and gained nothing for love...Ultimately it was a love story, as  Mr. Kubrick himself explained it. Basically, this was a man going crazy out  of his mind to keep the object of his affection safe and near him.  I guess  in that case, wife beaters, control freaks and the like are just fools for  love. But whatever. In the end, Humbert honors Lolita's wishes and at the  same time, faces the fact that she does not belong to him. Then he throws  his life away for the sake of quietly giving her some good ol' fashinoned  dignity. So I'm with Stan-it is a love story.  The only reason I left a  star out is because I've seen better movies, some of which, Kubrick did.
B00000JCB2|5.0|This CD is a definent buy for anyone who wants some good hard music with a twist. Limp Bizkit's 3dolla bills yall was definently a force for rap inflicted rock with such unknown hits as Stalemate and Stinkfinger and the  hits counterfeit and faith. but Significant Other is a album with no  limits. Best song is the calm then pounding No Sex, which u can tell is a  cry for headsinger Fred Durst to find a soulmate before he has sex  again.Another grand song is the blasting Trust? which if you are a big fan  of the bizkit boys is a part of the live song Cambodia splitted up(the  other half becoming the thank you ballad Show me what you got)but Trust?  has a underlining of paranoia and mistrust of fake friends.The Real Genius  of Durst and co. is the sad heavy ballad &quot;don't go off wandering&quot;  which gets the feeling of a nasty break up.but there are still metal toons  for you pure heavy bucketheads. Nookie, Break stuff,just like  this,9teen90nine and I'm broke are old bizkit heavy songs which still kick  a$$. a great Maturation for bizkit and a must for anyone with great music  taste.
B00000IOSU|2.0|I am pissed off that &quot;I Will Remember You&quot; is a horrible version.  One-Third of the original song is chopped off for no apparent reason.  Plus there is way too much audience interferance.  If you want a  good Sarah McLachlan album buy &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot; or  &quot;Rarities, B-Sides, and Other Stuff.&quot;  Trust Me.

B0000004V2|5.0|Judging by the previous 50 or so reviews you might be under the opinion that this is a bit of a classic album.......classic is too small a word to discribe the magnitude of this CD,it will go down in musical history as one  of the most important musical pices ever.Good to see so many fans from the  other side of the Atlantic with such fine taste.
6302878527|5.0|A movie that states that often personal happyness of each individual in a relationship needs to be suborned to the interest of the relationship,  that adultery is wrong, and were neither partner is all evil nor an  innocent a victim.  Also a movie that treats the viewer as an intelligent  adult, capable of putting together the pieces of a mosaic, and not child to  which the movie is merely a very long ad for the vidio game.  You might  think could not be made  You would be wrong.  Given the time in which was  made, the late sixtys the theme is down right subverslve.  Unfortunately  swiming against the tide, in this case did not lead to commercial success.   In all other ways is a masterpiece.  The script is wonderful, the acting  incredible, and direction is intellgent, an a hunting score.   Even the fad  of moment type american characters sever to add a bit of light humor to the  movie, and are the perfect foil for Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finny.   Both  of whom should have be nomintated of oscars.  <br />Note: stanly donen  pictures did not pay for this review
0061091480|5.0|when I was in college and had to do a book review for a psych class.  I didn't know I was about to read a book that would change my life and, for that matter, save my life.  To this day, after all the other self-help  books have collected dust on the shelf, I keep this one handy.  It's just  wonderful!  Highly recommended
B000002UCQ|5.0|All Things Must Pass is my favorite album of all time, and has been so since I was a teenager.  Whether it's the best Beatle solo album is a matter of opinion. I think it is, but a case can be made each for John's  Plastic Ono Band and Imagine, Paul's Band On The Run, and Ringo's Ringo.  All Things Must Pass is, simply, a towering achievement for George as a  lyricist, composer, producer, most of all as a guitarist and also as a  singer. &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; remains a incredible, transcendent  recording, and a superb introduction to this album; and what ever admitted  similarites there are to &quot;He's So Fine&quot; are ultimately pointless  (Hearing about that plagarism suit has become very tiresome, as NO ONE  seems to remember that Harrison ultimately won on appeal, and that Lennon,  too, was sued for plagarism for &quot;Come Together.&quot;) Listen to his  magnificent heavy riffing on &quot;The Art of Dying,&quot; his gorgeous  solo on &quot;Beware of Darkness,&quot; the sheer exhilaration of  &quot;Awaiting On You All,&quot; his own multi-layered voices on the  hypnotic &quot;Isn't It A Pity,&quot; and the tasty jamming with Clapton  and friends on &quot;Out Of The Blue.&quot;  George has never gotten the  respect he deserves -- let us not forget that, for one year at least (1971)  he was unquestionably the biggest rock star in the world. Listen to  &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; and &quot;The Concert For Bangla  Desh&quot; -- and the unfairly appreciated &quot;Living In The Material  World&quot; -- to hear why. If Paul &quot;Bip Bop&quot; McCartney  deserves  his own induction into the Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame, then George Harrison's  is LONG overdue.
6300184528|3.0|Murder On The Rising Star is a standard murder msytery - Starbuck (Dirk Benedict) is seen in near-constant fights with a bullying rival, Ortega (Frank Ashmore), who is later found shot to death with Starbuck's gun;  Starbuck is thus arrested and put on trial.<br />The basic plot is pretty  standard, but the episode adds a good twist; the actual killer is a man who  turns out to have played a major role in the Final Destruction, and who is  hiding in the Fleet under an alias.  Apollo (Richard Hatch) and Boomer  (Herb Jefferson Jr.) must enlist the aid of Baltar (John Colicos) to help  flush out the true killer.<br />The entire cast gets put through the emotional  wringer thanks to Rod Holcomb's excellent direction.  Starbuck all but  falls apart in the arms of Cassiopeia (Laurette Spang), and later threatens  to shoot Apollo in a mad attempt to flee into space in a viper.  <br />Such  excellence in acting and direction infuse a standard plot with good new  energy, and make for an entertaining episode.

0553565915|5.0|I read Embraced and was thoroughly moved.  For the first time I felt comfortable with God.  I had never, in my heart, believed that only one type of person belonging to a specific religion would receive salvation,  even though multiple religions today still teach that.  I keep two  copies of this book around (to loan out,) plus I keep Awakening Heart,  which I felt was more credible and truly reinforced the first.  Embraced  was okay, but Awakening was better.  Betty talks about how she encounters a  Russian man who died and was dead for THREE days and then woke up on the  autopsy table (I remember that news story!)He explains to her that we all  see different beings as &quot;God&quot;.  In other words, you have to read  it.  Betty talks so strongly about her love of Jesus, but acknowledges the  fact that He is represented by other &quot;names&quot;.  Do not fully  comprehend the first book until you read the second, what happened to her  after her &quot;visit&quot; and what she is doing now.  Like I said, you  can't judge the first book without reading the second.  I believe this  woman and this woman helped me believe in me and my spiritual life.
0380973464|5.0|This is the best book I have read in months.  It alternately provokes laughter, thought, contemplation, and sadness.  I'm not sure it's as good as Snow Crash or The Diamond Age, but is definitely in the same overall  league of excellence.  Due to its complexities, I think, though, that I'll  appreciate it even more the second time through.  The only drawback: shoddy  proof-reading; typos abound.
B00000J7S8|1.0|yes, and we've got the pictures to prove it! I'm a little confused- is she selling the music or the face?? What, a few risque, sassy songs, a load of pictures and we've got a winner? I don't think so at all. Spend your money  on real vocalists like Sarah Vaughn or Claire Martin. Eliane Elias can sure  kick a-- on the piano and she even composes tunes, too. Now THAT's  versatile. Diana just sings the exact SAME way on different tunes, that's  all.
B000002OK3|2.0|16 tracks and only 8 songs.  The other 8 are excerpts from the movie.  If I wanted to hear dialogue from the movie, I would have rented the movie.  Instead I wasted my money on the CD
B00000J7S8|1.0|This vocalist sounds like she just rolled out of bed and started singing. She takes her raspyness a little too far. It's nice every NOW and THEN but every since song and phrase is just a bit too much. I don't hear her  singing &quot;smoothly&quot; like others say. She sounds hoarse a lot. Why  does she always sing about body parts?? &quot;popsocle toes&quot; and  &quot;do it again&quot; are just a little too risque for me. I won't play  them at our radio station. Whole thing is average. I'm disappointed  thoroughly. She's more of a pianist than a singer-she should play NOT  sing!!
B000002GQH|5.0|Totally captivating on vinyl in 1969.  Refreshing and enlightening on cassette in 1984 while still holding some &quot;Future Shock&quot;.  Still a valid and commanding work in 1999 remastered on CD.  Required listening  in all of my music libraries that include music from The Dillards to  Angelique Kidjo.  Unarguably, the best of the Moody Blues!
