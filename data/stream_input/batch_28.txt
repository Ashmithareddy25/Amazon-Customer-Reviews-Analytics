B00DPM7TIG|5|This book is incredible. It's beautifully written, intelligent, thought provoking and insightful. I have recommended it to several people, and all have loved it. It's a long book, but it moves quickly, and you'll want to keep reading to find out what happens to the characters, and the key items from the plot. If you're on the fence, BUY IT! You won't regret it!
B0086700CM|5|it was sooooooooo much fun I couldn't take my eyes of it. get it get it get it get it!!!!!!!!!!
B00QW8TYWO|4|It's really fun to play and the different characters are really cool although I don't like it when I go the prize machine and get a character I already have it's a wast of my 100 coins. but otherwise the app is awesome
B004EPYZP8|5|This is a very good movie loved it that's why I purchase it.
B0064X7FVE|3|ok
030758836X|1|I was enjoying the book well enough until the last pages.  I was and remain horrified at the ending.  It changes how you view Nick, a character we were supposed to have at least some sympathy for.  But then he allows a sociopath, Amy, to \\"win.\\"  I'll use the word win so as not to reveal the ending if you are still enticed to read the book.<br /><br />The start of the book was iintruguing.  Anyone who thinks this is a murder mystery wasn't paying attention to what they were reading.  It was clear Amy disappeared on her own.  I was intrigued to find out why and entertained when the reveal came.  And then the ending.<br /><br />Nothing good to be taken from this book.
B002N14GPE|4|Anybody who likes mystery and thrillers will like this movie. One of the best mystery movies I have watched. Enjoy.
B000002WU9|3|This album is a little overrated.  Some of the beats are completely whaaack but the verses are very good.  Not an easy listen because of some of the beats but worth a playthrough..
B00BMT9C84|5|Heartwarming, some good laughs.
B00AB0AR2U|1|I can't help but watch Resident Evil when it comes on TV.  I know it isn't exactly Oscar caliber, but there is definitely something appealing about the franchise.  That being said, I was looking forward to Retribution, but was utterly disappointed.  This movie is just bad, makes little sense, and is not even worth the $3.99 24-hour rental charge.  Skip it!
B00B2JSRAS|5|lots of fun ....enjoyed the flow of the writer and the content is excellent.<br />can't believe i have to type these words to get my review submitted.
B005DOL0R0|4|Perfect!!
044651506X|4|I can't put down any of Mr. DeMille's novels.
0802798225|4|Alex Fuentes is gang member from the south side of Fairfield, and Brittany Ellis is a privileged girl from the north. Each have a status and a reputation to uphold at Fairfield High, but they also have secrets--for Alex, it's the desire to break free from the Latino Blood gang and his tough image and succeed in life. Brittany's life may look perfect from the outside, but at home, her parents are struggling to deal with Brittany's handicapped sister.      Brittany and Alex are on the opposite ends of the social scene spectrum, but that doesn't stop their chemistry teacher from making them lab partners. It's hate at first sight for both, but as they learn more about each other and slowly move beyond the stereotypes, they'll discover completely new people.     Perfect Chemistry is the classic love story of two utterly different people falling for each other, despite their initial loathing. Elkeles breathes new life into the old tale, giving it a fresh teenage perspective by interchangeably writing in both Alex and Brittany's point of view, keeping Perfect Chemistry fresh and evenly paced. The plot is realistic and sweet without being cliché, and the dialogue is perfect; gritty, and genuine. Each side is portrayed objectively, and though Alex and Brittany's relationship does move at a fast pace, their thoughts, insecurities, hang-ups, and urges all ring true and are easy for nearly any teen to identify with.      Though it is an important part of the book, the romance doesn't dominate it: strong themes of acceptance, diversity, courage, and independence are also present, making for a powerful read that boldly faces the consequences of gang life, and offers an unflinching look at how difficult it is to extricate oneself from it. Elkeles has created a riveting and strong novel with an important and relevant message and a romance hotter than any exothermic reaction.
B00OKYQZDI|5|Great game
B00I2TV3NO|5|Loved the 1st one and the same for the 2nd. Excellent acting, and special effects.
B00DJFIMW6|4|It is a very fun game, for my kindle fire it stops and has glitches. but otherwise very very fun!
B00FKF0F3C|4|Great book. My first reading of a Follett book, but not my last. It is long ,which is a fact not a criticism. From someone who was of age during the events depicted, it gave me a completely new, more perceptive prospective.
B00KFW4EFA|5|This YouTube app is amazing you can save/download things so when there is no WI-FI,<br />you are able to watch whatever you downloaded! There is nothing wrong with it.<br />I LOVE THIS APP!
B00L9B7IKE|5|Could actually feel protagonists fuzziness, confusion & uncertainty through the author's words.  Loved the 1st person accounts of the 3 characters.
B001PJRAUS|5|This modern take on the beloved classic \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is all out fun. The premise of what would happen if you could step into the book and meet the delicious Mr Darcy has many clever twists and outright laughs.  It also enticed my 17 year old to put down Twilight and pick up P&P. We caught this movie on BBCA, and immediately ordered it from Amazon. We have watched it several times, and have given as gifts.  The clever takes on many of the iconic scenes from P&P (favorite: Mr Darcy and the pond) invite you to join in on the fun the modern day Amanda is having with all of Miss Austen's characters.  I really recommend this fun film to all lovers of P&P, and to some Twilight fans, too!
B000VR824S|4|My crossroads CD was mailed satisfactory.  It is an excellent CD.  If  anything it could have come sooner.  I would recommend this to my friends.
B00006EXL5|5|My Chemical Romance's quality and originality has decreased steadily since this CD.  Those goth-looking and alternative rockers are not what My Chemical Romance started out as.  In this CD every song is unique, each with their own touch in both music and lyrics.  The whole album carries you in an avalanche from begining to end, and somehow the slower songs have as much energy from every source as the harder, louder ones.  Gerard's voice is just amazing.  Completely original and full of uncontained, raw energy, unlike, I regret to say, the later CDs.  The lyrics are just damn amazing, to the careless eye open and somewhat violent, but under that shallow layer (which seems to be what My Chemical Romance stuck with for The Black Parade) lies a world of coils and metaphors.  Now I'll do a review of each song, because they're all so unique that I can't capture the whole album in a panoramic view.  Romance: A short, musical introduction which sets the stage for the next song.  Beautiful and romantic, in a My Chemical Romance sort of way.  Honey, This Mirror Isn't Big Enough for the Two of Us:  Yeah, I love that title!  The song is more breathtaking than a fall flat on your back and just as impacting.  The lyrics are simply superb in that MCR \\"open\\" style with all those twisty little metaphors inside of it.  The singing and music are amazing also, leaving me to wonder why they changed.  This is MUSIC the way I've never heard it before.  Vampires Will Never Hurt You: At first I thought it was a roll and tumble downhill after Track 2.  The melody didn't seem to follow a set pattern and it seemed as though the words didn't really fit.  Then I realized they were all points in favor for the song.  It makes it diferent and unique, and the fact that they pulled off this dangerous variation only proves them better.  Gerard doesn't shy away from a good scream, and they carry the song not only on but up.  I cried with this song.  Drowning Lessons: Half a step down from the previoussongs.  While the lyrics are just as good the melody is a little on the hysterically happy side.  I can tell that they did it on purpose and I admire them for trying this variation but they fell a little short.  Our Lady of Sorrows: Oh man.  The energy of this song is just unmatched.  The only thing I have against it is that it's too short (a mere 2:05 minutes).  It's what I call \\"Wham!\\"  Just about left me on the ground (again).  Headfirst for Hallows: Another of the Drowning Lessons type.  Here they did better though, with more apt lyrics for the mood.  Skylines and Turnstiles: *Snif* One of the saddest songs ever written.  It had me crying by the fourth line.  From what I've heard, it's the first song Gerard wrote (album-quality, of course).  It's about the fall of the Twin Towers.  It just brought me back to the moment it all happened and all the pain and sorrow and USELESSNESS of it all.  I've honestly rarely cried like I did lying in the dark listening to Skylines and Turnstiles.  Early Sunsets Over Monroeville: This song, while being much slower than the others, and down-tuned musically, is the pinnacle of Gerard's singing.  The sweet, romantic start fades into a desperate cry of mysery and pain.  I cried through the whole thing.  There's something about the way Gerard chokes out \\"But does anyone notice? But does anyone care?\\" \\"And there's no room in this hell, there's no room in the next\\" and overall \\"And in saying you loved me made things harder at best\\" that just reveals the part in you that cries not only its eyes but its heart and soul out.  This Is the Best Day Ever: Another short one.  Precariously balanced, I think, on slightly different lyric style, catchy guitars and singing and the strategy of racing through the song, it did quite well.  Cubicles: Although not my favorite song, the proud owner of the best line ever written: \\"I'd photocopy all the things that we could be if you took the time to notice me\\". And I'd plaster that phrase all over my room if I could.  Just wonderfully ironic and metaphoric and smooth all in one.  Demolition Lovers: what can I say.  If I had to pick my favorite out of the whole CD it would be this one.  Another crying song, by the way.  Not so sad this time, just so incredibly beautiful.  \\"I'd end my days with you in a hail of bullets.//I'm trying, I'm trying, to let you know just how much you mean to me.//As snow falls on desert skies, until the end of everything.\\"  Everyone displays their talents without plain showing off (as they did in the ending track for Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge).  It starts out slow and then builds up to a eardrums-blasting grand finalle, both for the CD and for the last \\"real\\" My Chemical Romance we will probably ever hear.
B00003CXRM|5|This is a wonderful comedy with superb acting and music that the entire family will enjoy.  George Clooney, John Turturro and John Goodman were born to be in this movie but Tim Blake Nelson is one of those rare individuals who's looks alone will have you rolling in the floor with laughter.<br />Don't think you will not like this movie because you don't like bluegrass music.  By the time the movie is over, you will and I would recommend that you order the sound track CD at the same time you are buying this.  This movie will do more for bluegrass music than &quot;Deliverence&quot;.
B00CF34B2I|5|This game is unpretentious. It is what it is, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I have played a number of Magic-related games, and this is a clean, well-constructed ride from start to finish
B002ZG980U|4|I enjoyed this film and hope others watch it.
B00CNBS40M|5|He has most of the star wars LEGO and this added to his collection, happy with the product, and will purchase from the site again
B00AF6MF9I|1|Save yourself some grief kindle users r stuck in nowhere land n developers at gameloft haven't fixed it.  It's been at least ten days. Of course they didn't have a problem taking my money for stars.  Gameloft should be dumped by Amazon.
B00KFUU3GQ|5|Excellent
B00FAX6XQC|2|It's ok I hate how you run out energy bars I would only recommend this to people who like to run out of energy bars then you half to quit
B000GCFO0I|5|Now, in all honesty, I've never played the game, so I can't even say how closely it followed the storyline or the premise of the video game. I can say, however, that as far as horror movies go this one can stand on its own. The atmosphere that the director makes is one so dark and moody it's just creepy. The actions behind the faith and religion of those left in Silent Hill is downright scary, and the acting wasn't half bad. I know there aren't a lot of moments that will make you jump or scream, but the movie is disturbing and it is psychologically overpowering in moments. I may be wrong in all this because I've never played the game, but I feel that this is one of the better horror movies to come out in a while.
B006IYG5HE|5|It is a pleasure to have his books on Kindle. I have been reading books in Danish language. I recently read a book by Jacob Ejersbo that won awards in Denmark and was made into a Danish film: Nordkraft. I believe it should be available on kindle and be translated to English.<br />What can I say about Redbreast?. Keeps me glued to the kindle!
B00IG2DOKM|4|Have played for awhile. Keeps you busy. As you level up, it takes longer to complete orders. Not really a big deal, when my stuff is being created, I play a different game. This game is so different from other farm games,that I eventually deleted. I have played this one for months.:-) :-)
B00ESNDQWY|3|Season 5 was ok.
B000002UJQ|5|I still can't get over this album. In a way, it's like Dark Side of the Moon for me, because I listened it to death, but yet i can't get sick of it. Admittedly, this isn't entirely objective, as I am a radiohead fan, but even so, this goes just behind kid A as one of the best albums of the nineties. <br /> <br />1. Airbag: Never been a favourite, but it is very good. The guitar riff is especially catchy. Actually, a friend and I tried to play it as a duet on guitar and piano. It sounded ... interesting. <br /> <br />2. Paranoid Android: In my 'humble' opinion, best song of 90's. It has it all, in fact, like the title track of LA Woman, it could almost classify as a mini album in itself. I can NEVER get sick of the moment where Thom's sneering suddenly becomes this monster, getting angrier and more paranoid by the second. Jonny's solo has to be heard to be believed, especially the studio trickery in the second solo. It has an amazingly misleading title. If it is ever reissued, it should come with some boastful (Best Song of the 90's) subtitle. <br /> <br />3. Subterranean Homesick Alien: Beatiful lyrical imagery, but not as interesting musically. The lyrics are probably some of radiohead's best, certainly enough to warrant looking them up somewhere. <br /> <br />4. Exit Music (For a Film): Not a standout track at first, but is very hushed until the louder section in the middle. It really helps to show off Yorke's vocal range. <br /> <br />5. Let Down: Not really as good as the rest of the album; the guitars are beatiful, but the vocals are a little too whiny for most people... ie me :p. <br /> <br />6. karma Police: An excellent song, close to Paranoid Android and Lucky in sheer brilliance. Actually, the video clip is surprisingly good. It helps to get the message of the song across  quite well. There is this remix my friend sent me of this song crossed with A Day in the Life and a bit from I am the Walrus. It's not as good as either song, of course... <br /> <br />7. Fitter Happier: A bit like an interlude at the opera. <br /> <br />8. Electioneering: Great rocking guitars, very sneering vocals... very radiohead 'bends era'.  <br /> <br />9. Climing UP the Walls: According to yorke, the lyrics are about his part time work at a mental institution. My old cricket club was in a mental institution (no jokes!), and this song gave me the creeps when we drove in through the place past all the bland, barred-windowed buildings. Quite creepy. <br /> <br />10. No Surprises: Like Exit Music, it doesnt really grab your attention at first, but when you listen closely the sarcasm makes you smile. Or shiver. Lyrically, its like Nice Dream, with one particular standout line 'I'll take the quiet life/A handshake/some carbon monoxide'. <br /> <br />11. Lucky: AChingly beatiful, the eerie guitar noises introduce thoms' cooed lyrics, quite similar to 'You and Who's Army', while Colin's base really adds to the tension. Then the chorus explodes, with whoever is playing the lead guitar part (prabably jonny) soaring above the vocals. <br /> <br />12. The Tourist: supremely relaxing, this song is also quite clever in it's lyrics, and fantastic in it's musicianship. A bit Floyd-esq this one. It is supposedly about tourists in other countries, jsut rushing past everuthing to get to the main attractions. 'Slow down, idiot' <br /> <br />This album is not immediately listenable, but if you give it a chance to grow, you will most likely come to love it. If not, oh well, we all have different tastes.
B006BDHAX0|3|Like the game but it doesn't always work.  Often freezes
B00D1VKZ3M|5|Loved it. Laugh out loud material. Recommend for any fans of Bridgets journey. Will be buying a copy for my friends.
B003102JDM|4|\\"Kafkaesque ...is when you enter a surreal world in which all your control patterns, all your plans, the whole way in which you have configured your own behavior, begins to fall to pieces, when you find yourself against a force that does not lend itself to the way you perceive the world. You don't give up, you don't lie down and die. What you do is struggle against this with all of your equipment, with whatever you have. But of course you don't stand a chance. That's Kafkaesque.\\"--Frederick Karl<br /><br />The Coens philosophical universe is an empty one, a meaningless one, they have no nuggets of wisdom or insights to offer, they have no coping strategy. To them, religion and philosophy and mathematics offer no real assistance, and even art is no real consolation.<br /><br />When Larry Gopnik's life problems/stresses (unsatisifed wife whose met someone new, wife's new man who has the gall to offer him life advice, kids he doesn't understand, disgruntled S. Korean student sending letters to his dept chair undermining his shot at tenure, unstable brother whose own problems/stresses far outweigh his own) become too much for him to bear, he aks a young rabbi for advice, the rabbi just looks out the window at the parking lot and tells him what he needs is a new perspective, a perspective that will allow him to see the world differently but its completely up to Larry Gopnik to figure out how to adjust his perspective/his own perceptual antenna.<br /><br />When Larry Gopnik asks an older rabbi for advice, the rabbi just tells him a long story about the futility of looking for answers or meaning.

B00BD99JMW|5|This has been one of the best series I have ever read! I may not be a young adult, but there were times while reading this book that I can honestly and truly relate to. Thank you for that.
B00280LYHS|5|There are plenty of other reviews that are going to give a synopsis of this book/ series,so I don't want to reinvent the wheel here:<br /><br />I began this series shortly after I received my Kindle for Christmas.  I downloaded each book as soon as the last word was read in the previous one. I have finally understood what it means to CONSUME a book.  OMGods,  this series was AMAZING.  I have always been fascinated by Greek Mythology, and Mr. Riordan has brought those characters to (believable) life.  I feel like I have known, and cared for Percy all my life and watched him grow up and mature throughout the series.  He is a very likable, believable preteen/teen who is dealing with pressures/issues of regular mortal teens, (ADHD, Dyslexia, stepparents, crushes on girls) but also learning that he is a demi-god son of Poseidon, and the pressure of fighting monsters, learning his prophecy and trying to understand his powers.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed the way Mr. Riordan created characters, (even the evil ones), that you could picture in your mind as you felt that you were RIGHT THERE in the story traveling along with Percy.  I am very satisfied all around with the outcomes and feel they were very believable and made sense.... well, as much as they could in a Fantasy book.  Too many times when I have read a mystery or suspense book I am left with lingering questions, or a little disappointment in how conflicts were  resolved. In this last book of the series, there is just enough of a cliffhanger to make the reader curious and anticipate a continuation.<br /><br /> The only disappointment I feel is that the series is ended. As another reviewer wrote, that it was good that it ended where/when it did because it ended well, and if it would have went on, it would have stopped being good.
B00BEK6Z7M|4|Could not put it down. Finished the book at 1:35 am, and now I'm wide awake with nothing comparable to read.  This was an exciting read.
B006MPKDUE|4|The characters are real, they make you care. The stories are engaging without being contrived. Thoroughly enjoyable! There is a certain sense of inevitability, which I suppose makes this book a tragedy.
B00T73AO0W|5|As someone who grew up with original Mad Max films, I was totally excited to see the new film and also to get back to the originals. Unfortunately the new film is just a ghost shell of its predecessors. If you like your films where the central male character is second banana to a bunch of female rouges then you'll love Fury Road. Max is reduced to a secondary character that takes orders from the female lead for just about the entire movie. George Miller has pretty much made a feminist film here with Fury Road and I have to wonder if he was able to do so because the backing for the film came from feminist groups. It's no secret that Miller had been trying to get this film made for the last 15 years. On again off again reports would drift through media for years but never really giving explanations for why it couldn't come together. Money and backing is usually the reason for films not being made and possible he finally found his funding through feminist groups. Or maybe making all those kids films turned on his maternal side and he just wanted to empower woman in a action film. But to do it at the expense of one of the great action characters of the 80's is unforgivable and a slap to his own face, though I doubt he would see it that way.<br />As far as the original Mad Max film, it's still awesome today. It's gritty, edgy and it's real visuals. All the cool chases and wreaks are real and not cgi. The bizarre characters and humor also add to the viewing experience as well as watching Gibson take control of his character making it his own. There will be no other Mad Max like Gibson and that was even  more obvious watching Tom Hardy's horrible interpretation. It's just to bad that Mel showed his evil side to the world and pretty much ended his career. I think had all that stuff not happened, he would have been playing Max in Fury Road.<br />Buy this excellent Blu-Ray. Scream Factory did a excellent job with the transfer and you can see what gorilla film making was all about in the 70's.bout in the 70's.
B000B8QEZG|4|Mariah Carey, the stuffed sausage dog whistle, has sites that give links to reviews of other female singers telling her fans to write bad reviews. This is so immature. In any case, here's a true, valid review of this album: It's musically amazing, but the rating has to be slightly downgraded because of its lyrics in some songs. \\"I Love New York\\" is hard to listen to because it's Madonna trying so hard to be something she's not. However, she completely makes up for it with musical masterpieces, such as \\"Sorry\\" and \\"Jump\\" which are riveting and live in your head long after the songs stop playing. \\"Isaac\\" is not the controversial track it was made out to be. It's actually very fun and spiritual.  <br /> <br />In any case, don't listen to the bad reviews on here. They are planned from the stuffed sausage fans.
B00IIWO4UO|4|I like this series very much..this is so funny and comedy series..I already watched it each season before..but I am watching again. It make me laugh..
B0060ZJ7BC|5|Math.<br />Money.<br />Brad Pitt.<br />Baseball.<br />Failure.<br />Success.<br />Heartstrings tugged.<br />True story.<br />How could this NOT be a great buy???<br />My husband watches it ALL the time, like an obsession, almost. :)
B002QKZLZ6|5|Nice Case.  Doesn't slip off my belt or even my jean pocket.  It gives good protection and it's really well made.  I had a little trouble at first fitting my Plantonics BlueTooth in the case at first.  You have to push down a little on it, but not a big problem. I'm fussy and want everything to fit just right.  I would recommend this little case.  Your BlueTooth won't fall out because of the magnetic closure.  I am confident that my bluetooth is well protected by it.
B0063GORYU|5|Ive always been a huge fan of solitaire and this game satisfies that all familiar game combined with a few twists making this a more challenging highly addictive game than regular solitaire. You can also choose how challenging it is by picking how many suits to play in Settings (the more suits the harder the game). I sm hooked and play at least once a day! And its a free app so its a must have especially for tablets.
B0002EQ7EC|5|This is the last great album from Paul Simon.  Oh, how I wish he had more music to give to the world. After Graceland and this South American piece, I'm surprised he didn't explore other national sounds.  I miss you Paul!

B007A4SDCG|5|I am not even done with this book yet and practically have the chills with every lesson. Instead of a chapter like setting that has many pages per section, Pressfield writes in life changing sections that may only at times be a paragraph long. In my opinion he teaches us the secrets to happiness, self love, success and an overall well being from the depths of our souls. I am a picky reader and this one is a keeper. I am even thinking of having a poster in my room so that I can reminded everyday that it truly is a daily War on art and being the person who I am destined and whom you are destined to be. This is better than the Celestine Prophecy in my opinion. You will LOVE this book if you are in need of a positive change in your life and is the ultimate &#34;Self Help&#34; book. Om Shanti.
B00I1KDRBA|5|Awesome! This is a group that just rocks, no pop, no R&B, just basic, good old-fashioned rock n roll. Smart lyrics, a distinct band sound, but still many different sounds between each song. There are very few modern bands that I like, and even less that make more than one CD I can listen to consistently, and The Pretty Reckless is by far my favorite modern band.
B00AQF8CJ0|5|ZeptoLab did it again! If you like &quot;Cut the Rope&quot; you're going to love this game for sure. This is another puzzle solving game with ZeptoLab unique style. A must have; in my opinion.

I would rate by far as her best album ever because you get to see a complete concert recorded live (19 pieces) I prefer watching the DVD with the commentary I have yet to listen to the CD's! prefering to slump in my couch with my feet up and have watched it over and over and over again and have never tired of it. Of course not on the same day!I really wish she would make more albums like this, there is nothing like seeing her (almost) Live since I will probably never ever see her live in Canada, or Europe they are far away, and doubt she would ever play anywhere in the southern United States. Here she has presented her best music it is worth every penny. I understand her work is not for everyone but then again neither is heavy metal, or ballet. I purchased one and sent it to a friend as a gift. I have 9 of her albums, all of her music and can tell you this is her definitive album senna qua none You see all the exotic instruments, Mckennitt's Skilled harpestry, her spectacular voice, she also is a pianist and plays the accordion switching through out from one to the other with ease, I always listen to the concert with the commentary it is just beautiful. Buy this album and you will not be disappointed.

1853811262|5|I am amazed at the negitivity that the other readers haveexpressed regarding Atwood's Cats Eye.  <br />People have been soconditioned that they must expect a structured beginning, middle and end to a story.  They must have some conflict that needs to (and will be) resolved by the end of the story.  I say look deeper and you will find it in Atwood's Cats Eye.<br />The story was there, it lay bed of rich symbolic nature.<br />Elaine, disturbed and tormented, in her youth, held on to a cats eye marble.  The story also told of her in her adult life, as a painter.  Her paintings unleashed some of her youth, but it was not until she opened up a hope chest, found her red purse and the glass marble inside...that she had put all the pieces together.<br />You see, she had burried(in the hope chest) her hurt(the marble) so deep in her heart (the red purse)...and left it there...for years.  Until she found it. <br />This story came full-circle.  I enjoyed the uniqueness Atwood gave, and would re-read it.

B00L9B7IKE|4|I didn't know what to expect when I started this book. I tried to read Gone Girl and didn't get too far because I need to be hooked early in the book. Something with this book kept me going. I loved how you couldn't predict the ending. It's a great read! Read it whenever I could!
B0089LOKHG|3|There were two storylines in this book: Hana's story and Lena's story.<br /><br />Hana's story was gripping and interesting, following her life post-cure--the story of a golden girl at the top of society, marrying into a powerful family, a media icon and yet somehow, there's something wrong. This was a fascinating and very well done story line and I was completely hooked.<br /><br /> Lena's story was desperately dull, bogged down in more boring romantic stuff. I know the book is about a society which forbids love, so there has to be some romance. But Lena's romances are very dull. And the other part of Lena's story, trying to stay alive in the wild while pursued by evil regulators, was poorly paced, badly executed, unimaginative and frankly just dull. I hated having to slog through Lena's story every other chapter so I could get to the interesting story about Hana!<br /><br />And then there's the ending. Lauren Oliver said in an interview (and in a video on her tumblr account) that the ending was deliberately left open-ended to allow readers to imagine for themselves what comes next and have the book \\"continue to live inside you.\\" This is nonsense. A good ending can, in fact, leave a lot to the imagination, but there is a skill in doing that--and Ms. Oliver, despite her obvious skin in storytelling in general, simply hasn't learned that skill.<br /><br />This ending feels simply like a cop-out. It feels like she kept writing without a plan and then, at the end, there was no way to craft a spectacular ending...there wasn't a way to do that since she hasn't planned and hadn't planted the seeds for it. It was a letdown, like, you took me on this long journey and you didn't know where you were going?<br /><br />There could have been a way to craft the ending--even leaving even less closure than she did--which could have been more satisfying. It's not simply by not answering questions that you create a book that lives on in the readers. It's by making revelations at the end that are powerful enough to keep you thinking about the book for years...when a book does that, the ending becomes less important and it can be more powerful to leave the details to the imagination. But if you don't have anything powerful to give us, stop trying to be \\"literary\\" with the ending and simply give us a good conventional satisfying ending with the is dotted and the ts crossed.end that are powerful enough to keep you thinking about the book for years...when a book does that, the ending becomes less important and it can be more powerful to leave the details to the imagination.

B008JMKN4Y|3|Abby Abernathy is a good girl, or at least she is trying to be. She has fled her hometown to attend Eastern University and escape her past. Travis Maddox is the epitome of a bad boy - covered in tattoos, earns money fighting in an underground fight club, and is notorious for his one night stands. When Abby meets Travis at one of his fights, she is instinctively drawn to him and Travis is intrigued by her outward disdain for him. The truth is that neither one can stay away from the other. When Abby loses a bet, she must live with Travis for one month. The more time the two of them spend together the more complicated and entwined their relationship becomes, bring them both to the point of destruction.<br /><br />I liked this book, but I didn't love it. It is basically a twist on Beauty and the Beast. Abby is not as innocent as Belle is, but she is the antidote to Travis' beastly ways. She's no angel herself however. She often pushes Travis' buttons and tries to provoke a response from him, even though she knows he is a bomb waiting to explode. Travis is a much more complex character than Abby, and I was disappointed that we do not get to learn more about his back story, because it might explain why he is the way that he is. He is certainly not the perfect male lead. In fact he is really more of a cautionary tale. He is jealous, possessive, prone to violence, and borderline abusive. I found myself cringing sometimes when reading this book over the things Travis did, because they are simply not acceptable in a healthy relationship. He was not the dark angel for me, he is simply just dark. In the end, they do definitely deserve each other and I guess you can say that they save each other. I just not sure if either of them is a better person because of it.<br /><br />Book two, Walking Disaster, is due to be published in April 2013 and is the same story told from Travis' point of view. I have to admit that I am intrigued by this and will most likely be picking the book up when it comes out. For me, Travis is the more interesting and complex character of the two and I am looking forward to reading the story through his eyes.<br /><br />See more of my book reviews at [...]t.

B00004UEDQ|4|Before The Blind Side hit it big, Sandra Bullock was an undervalued asset. She made a lot of films, some good, some awful, but she got blamed for the failures, and never got credit for her good performances. Since winning the Oscar and then being cheated on by Jesse James, the public's sympathy has shifted 180 degrees. For a while there it was 24/7 Bullock, Bullock, Bullock on the airwaves, all day/every day. Critics like me are digging up films from the archive and going back to uncover any forgotten gems we may have missed. 28 Days is not the mother lode, it is just a load of Bullock.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------<br />Gwen Cummings: Is that available stitched on a pillow somewhere?<br />=============================<br /><br />During filming in New York Sandra Bullock stayed in the recently departed Dennis Hopper's apartment and that alone should have inspired the young thespian. Her method of acting involved downing a triple espresso before any scene that required her character to have uncontrollable shakes. Is that how Hopper did it in Blue Velvet? Bullock is allergic to horses, but one scene of equine therapy required her to gain a horse's trust so it would allow her to bend the horse's leg. In spite of her allergies, she bent it. What a trouper.<br /><br />-----------------------------<br />Betty: Tonight's lecture: Are you a blackout drunk, or don't you remember?<br />==================<br /><br />Betty Thomas, who was an officer on Hill Street Blues, and also acted in such films as Troop Beverly Hills, has stepped behind the camera where she has directed The Brady Bunch Movie and others of that caliber. She also directed Private Parts, the bio pic about shock jock Howard Stern. She is no Orson Welles, but knows how to serve up some light hearted fare such as 28 Days.<br /><br />OK, it is not so bad in a kind of made-for-TV movie, after school special, sit com level acting kind of way. A light hearted romp through rehab. It's no Leaving Las Vegas, Days of Wine and Roses, Rachael Getting Married, or When a Man Loves a Woman. Sandra Bullock has a certain ineffable charm, and the cast of characters are all kind of cute in their own peculiar ways. Alan Tudyk plays Gerhardt, an extremely odd character who improvises a strange monologue about forks in the road. He is perhaps the wackiest neighbor, the Cosmo Kramer, if you will, of 28 Days; but the ever so slightly less odd characters anchor the story.<br /><br />Dominic West plays Jasper, her boyfriend, her enabler, her co dependent. The audience, and eventually Gwen Cummings can see that he is not very helpful to Gwen in her quest for sobriety. Viggo Mortensen plays Eddie Boone, a baseball player with substance abuse issues. He is your average jock, except that he is a secret soap opera fan, showing his softer side. They created a soap opera within the movie, and it was called Santa Cruz. Also a big fan of Santa Cruz was Gwen's roommate Andrea (Azura Skye). Mike O'Malley plays one of the other rehabbers, and he can currently be seen as Kurt's dad on Glee.<br /><br />Steve Buscemi is in this playing a counselor called Cornell. He does an adequate job, but it is not up to the level of his Theodore Donald 'Donny' in 1998's The Big Lebowski. But bottom line, what is?<br /><br />------------------------------<br />Cornell: This isn't a way to live.

B005HP2J66|5|Herzog's meditation on the beginnings of art, perhaps that which differentiates our species from others, centered on the amazing pictographs found in the Cave of Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc in France left this viewer very satisfied and raring to go to a 3-D presentation in a theater. Like his film about Antarctica, Herzog found great characters to tell a story that is far beyond a simple presentation of scientific facts or conjecture. From a perfume creator with his almost superhuman nose searching for drafts that might smell like a cavern that had been sealed for thousands of years to archaeologists and artists Herzog interweaves stunning footage of the cave itself, a lovely musical soundtrack, and artful questions being thoughtfully addressed. He leads inevitably to a young scientist who relates a story of Stone Age awareness coming from Australia in which the Aboriginal artist does not consider himself as the creator/editor of work, but merely as the conduit. Herzog is typically searching for greater universal meaning in his world and this film is no exception. He proposes that the beginnings of spirituality were what distinguish modern humans from other species, and this is what is driving the creation of art. This is a stunning work of subtle beauty.

0062409859|5|If you are modern sentient citizen of the old South you will understand the complex subtext of this book.  Initial reviews on Amazon seem to fault the aging of the Atticus character without understanding the perspective of the ideological undercurrents that bridge modern life in a metropolitan city and the historical undercurrents that despite all things persist and continue.  When Atticus won the trial in Mockingbird, he did not win over the people or change their attitudes overnight.  Racists are alive and persisting in South:  a black man is dragged to death behind a pickup in East Texas,  a black woman fails to signal  a turn and dies in a jail despite reporting a history of suicide; black children in Texas continue to attend grossly inferior schools, and Trump tells us that Mexicans are rapists and drug smugglers.  Remember the author chooses to live in the old South; she does not offer an absolution or a solution to racism.  I've seen a series of unusual historical wide angle photographs taken over some years in the early 20th century in Waco, Texas.  These photos were wide panoramic photos one sees of high school classes.  A series of photos I have seen are of the annual Waco Klu Klux Klan picnics.  The odd thing is that men, women, and children are photographed in the full Klan regalia - notably with their hoods down. There are no public Klan members.  Apparently a few hundred Waco citizens attended these annual picnics - but none of them wanted their faces seen in the photographs.  This wasn't just one photo, but annually for decades.  Those hooded and anonymous Klu KIux Klan members are the strange deep South ethos that Go Set a Watchman captures.

B005WGBQ9G|4|I am enjoying the break from all the gore of season 1, but like others have said the characters in season 2 seem to constantly be doing stupid things. What annoys me even more is the unresolved cliffhangers. For 6 episodes they have been looking for a lost girl. That is just too long. And then there's the man and his son from the very first episode. Why don't we find out what happened to them?
B007JM4CWY|5|Great game.  There are so any levels and each puzzle is taking longer to solve! The only minus is that as the board gets bigger it is harder to play on the small mobile display.

B000050XEI|1|I admit to not being a huge Enya fan, but some of her albums, particularly &quot;Watermark&quot; and &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot;, are quite enjoyable. This one is, with only one or two exceptions, incredibly bland. Add to that the fact that it's short on playing time, and I can only conclude that it's not worth getting unless you're determined to have a complete Enya collection. Or you want some extremely inoffensive background music.

B00LP9E79U|1|Really boring pastiche of something akin to Terry Gilliam's movie. ( I would wait for Gilliam's movie Zero Theorem -august). As many reviewers of the 5-star ilk and the 1-star back passenger ilk have commented with such distinctive polarity, the  movie is a dark dystopian movie with no real climax, more of a dark and ugly anti-climax which leaves the viewer feeling cheated at the end.<br /><br />It is a man's journey from the very dark abyss of becoming a savage by eating babies to the front of the train, to see some maniacal 'god-king' who callously and tirelessly espouses some mind-numbing philosophy of the have and have-not and his brain-numbing justifications how he is allowed to live in luxury, while the other half of humanity are starving to death.<br /><br />I think, many people have heard of this nonsensical diatribe about why tyrant and kings live the way they do...this Korean director seems to be mocking the North Korean dictator and most of the viewers here who rated it a 5-stars are awestruck with this revelation. Just google how North Koreans people are eating dead corpses and buried bodies due to starvation...this is happening now in North Korea, you don't need to see a slick movie to visualize such incredible brutality occurring even today.

B00NOPQU2K|3|I bought this book on my Kindle thinking it sounded like an interesting idea for a story. THEN I read the reviews and wished I hadn't bothered. But when I ran out of other books to read, I turned to this and read it... and was pleasantly surprised. I actually didn't hate this book. It wasn't as bad as some reviews would have me believe. It was decent. Not amazing, but not terrible either.

B00GIY5OGC|5|Great for kids they could not look away
B00001OH7V|5|After Bowie and Eno's negative and lonely album called &quot;Low&quot; (still one of Bowie's best), I suspect Bowie wanted something a little more positive.  Clearly he was getting his life back on track.  He was going  through his divorce with Angie, and at the same time gaining sole custody  of his son.  The first track on &quot;Heroes&quot; discusses the famous  fairy tale of &quot;Beauty and the Beast.&quot;  The song, by the same  name, proves the fact that Bowie's mood is changing more positive.   However, I think it shows a self-absorbed Beast.  Which, is quite the  opposite of the Beast in the fairy tale.  He seems to get mad if you  comment on his appearance.  The lyric of &quot;Someone fetch a priest, You  can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast&quot; seems to show Bowie in a  possible jealous mood.  After his marriage had &quot;gone wrong&quot; Bowie  may have been jealous of lovers reaching their destiny.  Towards the end of  the song, Bowie shows his desperation of the marriage.  He appears to  wanted to believe the marriage was still alive, but he knew the reality of  it all.  &quot;Joe The Lion&quot; seems to speak for itself.  And what I  can I say about &quot;Heroes.&quot;  This song is probably the lover's  anthem of the world.  &quot;Sons Of The Silent Age,&quot; most likely my  favorite, depicts the generation calling him &quot;The Godfather of  Punk.&quot;  &quot;Blackout&quot; seems to be at first sight, a weird and  complicated song.  Once you dissect the lyrics, you realize that once again  Bowie is talking about his ex-wife Angie.  The lyric &quot;Get me to a  doctor's I've been told, Someone's back in town the chips are down&quot;  clearly is talking about the time Angie came to visit Bowie in Berlin.   Once she arrived, Bowie suffered an anxiety attack and Angie rushed him to  the hospital.  The author of &quot;We Could Be Heroes,&quot; Chris Welch,  seems to think that Bowie is debating the once hostile issue of Hitler's  V-2 rockets pointing directly at London.  A better explanation of &quot;V-2  Schneider&quot; would be that Bowie is comparing Maria Schneider's jazz to  a V-2 rocket.  A friend of mine cannot stand &quot;Sense Of Doubt.&quot;  I  can't find anything wrong with it.  I think it's very creative and would  make a great addition to a horror movie soundtrack.  &quot;Moss  Garden&quot; is also a great Bowie instrumental.  I say Bowie because it  was his idea all along for &quot;Moss Garden.&quot;  I also rally like  &quot;Neukoln.&quot;  &quot;The Secret Life of Arabia&quot; reminds me of a  fantasy world much like Aladdin Sane's 'Drive In Saturday.&quot;

B005FISBTO|5|I have seen all of the episodes of Dexter chronologically, and, in my opinion, this season and the fourth season were the two best to date. Colin Hanks and Edward James Olmos do a great job of acting, the story arcs and plot lines are smooth and consistent throughout the show, subplots are well developed with other characters keeping much more relevant and interesting stories than in some of the other seasons, and the themes and motifs of religion are a refreshing change and transition from the fatherhood/family ones that were beginning to grow rather stale. Additionally, there are lots of interesting character developments that occur, as well as underlying plots that should transition into later seasons well (should all of the stories continued to be developed in later seasons-- I hope they will, as this is something that producers hinted at during the commentary/special features on this season).<br /><br />My Rankings:<br /><br />--- BEST ---<br /><br />A. Tie between Seasons 4 & 6 (Trinity Killer & Doomsday Killer),<br /><br />B. Season 2 (Bay Harbor Butcher) ***Most narrow gap between the remaining seasons in terms of favoritism is between Seasons 2&5<br /><br />C. Season 5 (Julia Styles/Barrel Girls/Self-Help Gurus)<br /><br />D. Season 1 (Ice Truck Killers/Back Stories)<br /><br />E. Season 3 (Miguel Prado Story) ***Widest gap between seasons in terms of favoritism is between Seasons 1&3<br /><br />--- WORST ---

I couldnt wait to turn the next page to reveal what would happen next. This  book is a real page turner! It has a subtle humour  adds charm to the characters

B0083SBJXS|4|I bought this for my husband who is a big fan of all the Marvel comic characters...we did manage to catch it on the big screen...in which case, that is where the rubber hits the road, when it comes to all the spectacular action and 3d effects and all. This turned out to be surpringly good for me even though I don't get into the graphic novel/comic book subculture all that much...I am one who can still appreciate the work that goes into it. Villainous Asgardian Loki, the god of mischief has been threatening to steal the &#34;tesseract&#34; (aka cosmic cube)...a portal that can bend reality to whatever the holder wishes. This weasely-looking character Loki (also Thor's half brother) conspired with the Chitauri , an alien race led by the &#34;Other&#34; who apparently promise Loki an alien army with the ability to subjugate all earthlings, in return for the powerful Tesseract . Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and the Hulk team up with Nick Fury ( the director of the S.H.E.I.LD agency), Black Widow and Hawkeye to defeat Loki and his alien arms once and for all.  For a blockbuster movie hit this one was a real winner and this combo pack dvd/blu-ray set with special features turned out to be an excellent purchase overall! I recommend!
B00B2V66VS|3|I love playing but when I try to get in it says imigi studios then goes to the home page!!!!!!!Otherwise its a fun game. I would NOT reccomend this to kindle fire users.
B00AF3RDLQ|3|After several books in the series now we have an expectation that a certain formula will be followed.  Uhtred will be involved in several small scale skirmishes, his loyalty will be tested, and ultimately he'll side with King Alfred and take part in a major battle where he plays a decisive role.  It's formulaic but what the heck, I like this series and consider them all four to five star reads.<br /><br />In this one though for once Cornwell plays with his formula a little. Alfred is dying and all the kingdoms of Britain are waiting to see what will happen.  Uhtred is sure the Danes are planning to attack but he cannot convince anyone else. And then for the most part they don't attack. Uhtred wanders the countryside trading insults, he gathers intelligence, builds, he travels some more and most chapters end with \\"I know they are coming\\" and the next chapter begins with \\"But they didn't come. Why not? I was sure they would by now!\\"<br /><br />If Cornwell had devoted this to some character development, maybe had Uhtred start to plan his return to Bebbanburg or take an active role in his children's lives or something it would feel less like a waste of pages but as it was, this one struggled to keep my interest. Three stars.
B00L9B7IKE|3|The story is sort of intriguing but the writing is mediocre. I never really cared about any of the characters.
B000GW8RX4|1|Poor quality DVD with lines running through it on and off throughout the entire 2 hours of video.  I would suggest a remake of it before you try and sell it to the public.

B00BEK6Z7M|3|White Fire falls far short of the standards established by Preston and Child in earlier works. For fans (like me) of the body of work created by these writers, this is a readable and moderately interesting book, and of course it updates the ongoing Pendergast storyline. But it is in many respects a very poor piece of work, and as I reader I felt disrespected by a very weak conception, deficient characterization, and poor plotting. As a once-avid fan of these writers, I should explain these serious and accurate criticisms. Premise? Not very interesting; a tie-in with Conan Doyle (Sherlock Holmes) comes across as the shallow and artificial device that it is. Characterization is godawful. Pendergast is an intriguing, deep character and a great creation. In White Fire, we learn nothing further about him, and he simply shows up, outhinks everyone as usual, and that's it. Readers who are not familiar with the earlier books will simply not know who he is, etc., because Preston and Child provide no interesting backstory or real-time character development whatsoever. This is a terrible, disappointing omission. The other characters are flat as pancakes, including the main character, a Pendergast ward who is mostly unlikeable (though we are forced to accept her as hero) and whose actions are mostly selfish, petulant, or dumb. We are forced to accept her as special because Pendergast has chosen her, but in the story itself there is no evidence of brilliance, charisma, or depth. the authors waste the opportunity to introduce a great character by giving us this dud. The plot itself is a simple pastiche of incidents; my sense of the tale is that the writers assigned chunks to each other, shared their work over email, and then cut-and-pasted the thing together. It's very heavy-handed. It's also totally predictable. I am not a reader who tries to guess conclusions; in White Fire, I found that every time something &#34;important&#34; occurred as the book wound up, I knew what it would be. People show up when needed to save the day, the people you think are guilty are guilty, etc. I experienced zero surprise, zero excitement, zero wonder or mystery. Readers of the series will like this book simply because we've already bought in to the Pendergast series. But make no mistake: this is bad, sloppy, dull work. An increasingly large number of readers are sensing the steady decline in the quality of work from these once-compelling writers. Personally, I was offended by the low quality of this offering. Pafe after page, I found myself asking, &#34;What's happened to these guys?&#34; It's simply not a good book.
B001RAXGV2|5|one of the real big ones. this album has gone on to influence what was an acceptable sound. the bombastic compositions arrangements and bass playing on this album set the bench mark for dozens of acts to follow. growing out of bowie's band the hype-this was the real deal. this was THE REAL original meeting point of pre-glam, hard rock/pre-metal and alternative all wrapped in a cartoon sleeve by a truly original voice that stopped folks dead in their tracks. we were lucky to have had these in the discount bins at home and pretty much everyone I knew had copped their own  99c piece of vinyl bliss and proceeded to wear it out. a real staple back here in the crazy but surprisingly well informed eastern panhandle of WV.
B004EPZ07U|1|Please bring back regular digital copy, this ultraviolet is BS. It's misleading to have digital copy on the cover of this, when it's not usable in iTunes.
B00FVVR2ZO|4|The game is a fun way to kill some time. The graphics are cute and there actually is a story line. You are able to visit and help your friends through the day, as long as you replace your strength. It is very easy to learn how to play and is a really good HOG, because it ranges from easy to find all the way up to a real challenge.
B00SI7GCJK|5|Great movie. Not an action pack motion picture. Kinda reminds me of 2001 A Space Odyssey.
B000B8L6LI|5|I used to use a Gerber wet stone free hand. Then I found a clamp that holds bladed at one specific angle to use along with the wet stone.

B00IBZ5YKW|4|This is an interesting look into a bully's rationale for his behavior. His parents are in great part to blame for his actions, as they-especially the mother-make excuses for him. Herein lies the problem with many students today. Thank goodness for his no-nonsense French grandmere.

B002QNBRXS|5|I am a new fan of Dexter's...just started watching the shows.  I started back at Season 1 and am working my way up.  Love Michael C Hall...and all the characters.  Michael is great in the role of Dexter!!  It's funny..it's suspenseful...good plots....you just want to keep watching.  So sad that Season 8 is the last.

B000W7JWUA|5|We took Catan into a game store to have the professionals teach us how to play it because the rule book is daunting!  But once you learn how to play, it's very enjoyable.  My 12-year-old and I love it, and we even got my husband to play, and he's not a great lover of board games.

B00BPJ5Z96|5|Great 40th anniversary edition of this iconic martial arts masterpiece. A nice upgrade in picture & sound will keep fans very happy. Some interesting new extras & fun packaging make this a must. Buy with confidence.
B00A8MGLAI|5|Cloud Atlas is nearly three hours long.  During my viewing, I never regretted the length.  Not once did I get impatient for the movie to end.  This movie is actually many stories woven into a single film.  The film held my attention for its' full length.  I even stayed around for the credits to listen to the movies beautiful (and relevant) theme music.  For me to be engrossed in anything for three hours straight is amazing.  But Cloud Atlas is an extraordinary film.  Hollywood enough to keep your adrenalin pumping but European\cosmopolitan enough to cause you to think about the movies content and wonder at the story's moral.  I think Cloud Atlas is a popular film masterpiece.
B000E116CG|5|Great packaging and of course a great record. Good addition to my collection!
B008Y2FRFO|4|I love this game. It is very addictive. I would have given it 5 stars, but you have to wait too long to get more coins once you use up your supply. (One every 30 seconds or a full supply after several hours). Try it...if it's free, well worth the price.
B00TYB95I4|4|Intense movie, but well done.

1591843162|4|I've been a fan of Seth for a while through his blog and then reading Tribes, which makes me a new comer to the \\"tribe\\" of Seth.  This book exemplifies a lot of the reason that I'm a fan of what Seth has to say.  His iconoclastic way of looking at the world makes you stop and consider if what you've always believed is really the way that it is.<br /><br />In \\"Linchpin\\" Seth takes on the topic of economy and asks if we're still living in an industrial age.  Seth's approach is that we are in a new age - which still has yet to be defined, a sort of postmodernism of economic systems.  Just as postmodernism sought to define itself away from modernism, Seth defines the worker today away from the industry or factory of the industrial age.<br /><br />The writing has the hallmark of Seth's other books - chapters are subdivided into things that are probably best termed \\"blog posts\\", which makes for an easy and fast-paced read.  I enjoyed this book a lot, and it got me out of a few slumps I've been feeling with its ability to make myself ask new questions.  I recommend you pick it up.
B0042TV4IW|5|We need more of this type of healthy family movies.  Parents working together and not sarcasm making fun of the greatly important role of parents. Friends and neighbors working together despite of personality differences.
B00080ZG10|3|Good job of props, casting and acting however this movie tends to trivialize the life of a great man. I felt it should have spent more time on his vast acomplishments and less time on his physical/mental ailments which only became apparent in his later years, not early on as the film seems to suggest. I know, because my Grand Father worked with him on the HK-1 (Spruce Goose).
B003XF1XOQ|4|The first two books were very quick to read. This one took a little while to read it wasn't as catchy but very good indeed.
B00FRQ32N4|5|You need to get it if you are a fan of real steel!!  The controls are easy, sometimes atom's orgin pack pops up. It gives you 7/7 energy cores, 10000 real cash ( I don't mean &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; money that's just what the game calls it) and 100 real gold. Don't think it is a ripoff because I own the game and yeah. See ya!😁

B000002G60|5|Having been the first Suzanne Vega album i've ever bought , this seemed to me unimpressive and quite bizzare at first . It is wrong though to try to judge Nine Objects Of Desire without taking the time to study carefully the songs and to distinguish the role it plays as a part of the discreet yet essential  change in Vega's sound .<br />    While on 99.9F the singer made the big step and reinvented herself by mixing her guitar melodies with funk and machinery sounds , on this offering we find her giving jazz a try . The lyrics are once more challenging and sharp . On &quot; Birthday (love made real) &quot; Vega sings about the experience giving birth . &quot; One Thing i know , this pain will go &quot; she declares at the beginning of the song only to start shouting &quot; shake all over like an old sick dog... &quot;  with stange enthusiasm on the refrain . On &quot; Honeymoon Suite &quot; she tells us a hauntig story about visions and ghosts in some hotel-room in France . Her lines in many tracks are full of metaphors and symbolisms . What does her &quot; Favourite Plum &quot; stands for on the last track ? Is it a man ? Or is it the life she wants to have ? It's all these details that make this record so exciting .<br />    Musically the variety is easily being sensed by the listener. Vega choses to follow paths she's never been to before and sings a bossa nova confession of lust in &quot; Caramel &quot; and the smoked , bluesy &quot; Headshots &quot; on which &quot;...a poster of a boy on the wall &quot; whose &quot; two eyes in the sade ,a mouth so sad and small &quot; brings in mind an old lover . <br />   See Nine Objects Of Desire as a piece of potrait's puzzle picturing a woman who behind her calm looks hides so much soul and personallity . That's when you'll understand how great it actually is.
B008FRFN7A|5|I never knew that I could print from my Kindle. This is an awesome app. Probably, my all time favorite app.

1612680011|5|To say anything negative about this book is outrageous. It's an amazing journey, amazing facts, and a great learning experience. Mr. Kiyosaki delivers with this great book. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
0930289234|2|First of all, frankly, until the movie was in production, I had never had much interest in reading this \\"graphic novel\\", I, of course, had heard of it, it's sort of urban legend.  I have to admit, after reading it, I am totally perplexed as to what all the fuss was about.  Taking into account that the subtext is very dated; it was written in the 80's at the height of Reagan, I just found it oddly pedantic and sort of precious.  I did like the character Rorchach, his musing, sort of non sequitor, were very funny, I felt he above all else resonated.  On the other hand, Dr. Manhattan's musing were like reading Henry James by way of Einstein..very laborious reading, and yes, I got the subtext of his argument, but geez it was dry.  The romance angle seemed very sophomoric, like it was written by somebody who had never had a date.  The character Ozymandias was the limit, I mean, this guy is straight out of the worst of Bond..I mean a Ramses II and Alexander complex, give me a break, he of course is pivotal to the book, but he was ridiculous, an Arctic Lair, are you kidding me?!!  His \\"final solution\\" is beyond nuts and Dr. Manhattan sums his arrogant naive stupidity up perfect at the end.  Last, but not least, well maybe least, was the \\"famous\\" pirate story imbeded in the overall story arch.  At first, I must admit, I found this story much more stimulating than the, past, present, and future story arch of Watchman, I started to think I was going to need a dramamine, the way Watchman kept falling back on itself, them speeding forward..anway back to the Pirate, like I said, it was really interestig at first, then it just sort of went really bizarre and abruptly ended, I was like, this is It?!!..im sure it was a metaphor, but still it seemed abrupt and as for the Squid, well, it is a perfect metaphor for this \\"novel\\"..a bloated corpse, existing for no apparent reason.
B00DJFIMW6|5|It is an amazing game. I love it. Everyone would love to play this game. I will tell my friends about this game for sure.
B0054JZC6E|5|my daughter downloaded this game for her.  but I see my self playing more then she does.  although the prizes of the locked games could be cheaper.
B003MC5N28|4|I first read this book many years ago in school and have read it multiple times since. It is an easy read and very enjoyable. My only wish is that it was longer and that it had more detail. I would definitely recommend it though and I am sure I will read it again in the future.
B000FA675C|5|Great book. Better than the movie. A mix of reality with fantasy helps the reader create realistic images and makes you think what if it isn't fake.
096798467X|5|You won't regret getting this book! I built my own earth oven using this book as my guide and the oven works wonderfully. Don't try to do it on your own - buy this book and he'll tell you exactly how high to make your dome,, how large to make the door . . . things you just need detailed before beginning.
B00FRVH3V6|1|Wow Rick riordan. All the others were good but this one was just awful. Shea lost in 3 pages! So many loose ends! What happens to Percy and Annabeth they are barely in here at all. Terrible rip off don't buy please.

B00008H2LE|5|Well i'm writing this kinda late...the album has been out for a couple months now, i got the oppurtunity to be invited to their 2nd music video shoot for \\"faint\\" last month in Hollywood, CA... and after reading a good majority of these reviews (starting with the poor reviews first because i wanted to see what exactly people didnt like about METEORA) and i have come to the conclusion that LINKIN PARK IS STILL #1 in my book and the negative reviews on here were rather weak and bleak and seemed to come from people who are just interested in a certain genre of music...if u go through life putting a label on everything thats just sad...love the music for what it is and how it speaks to you, NOT for where its shelved at the local store...so if you truly are a die-hard fan of LINKIN PARK you should definitely buy this cd, ESPECIALLY if u don't have it by now...My favorite songs on the album are...well u know whut, i have the album in my car's alpine and everytime i play it, i just automatically hit shuffle because every song on this album is great and unique in its own way...so coming from a TRUE fan i highly recommend that u purchase METEORA...A+++ i would have given 10 STARS if it went up that high on here...
0062101897|5|This is a big, beautiful book, with a great markdown price. It's a gift for a grown daughter who shared Harry Potter with her dad (me) when she was a kid, one of our few, common interests, which makes it special.
B0055PGUYU|5|This is a terrific book. I've recommended it several times already.
B008Y2FRFO|4|Great time...but looking for more action..  perhaps a bit more of a reward up front to set the hook...other wise cut bait.
B004VMUS9G|5|Hey, I'm awake so I guess that's good.
B000KIRT6A|3|I wanted an EQ pedal.  This one was cheap enough and works, but of all the Behringer pedals I have owned (4) this is the cheapest one of the bunch.<br /><br />It works as advertised. The sliders move easily- too easily so it is easy to knock them out of the  settings inadvertently.  I find that of all the pedals that I own I use this the least.  I've found that other pedals with tone controls make this the first pedal that gets kicked off my pedal board when it gets crowded
B00992CF6W|5|I love this game. Can't stop playing it. But I think u should add Redstone stuff buckets of water and multiplayer. Then nothing could top it!!!!!
B00KA87GCW|3|Haven't been playing too long. But enjoying it , so far ....energy constraints aren't that bad and there's a lot to do, leveling up is pretty fast. My biggest complaint would probably be that although most people don't believe it not every single human has a Facebook page....why do game companies insist that we harrass our friends???? If your game is awesome I will TELL people not aggravate them into playing.
B00DJFIMW6|5|This game is amazing. It is so cool when the minions move and sing before you start a new game. Minion Rush is the best game ever
B00IINPXLW|4|This game is fun for kids especially, but for adults too. It challenges minds and literally takes them to the next level! Have fun with the new game.
B00G8IIICK|5|Adventure and suspense with lust Victorian writing and some classy illustrations. I love wilkie Collins, great writing to read in our day and age!
B009ZQ8FQG|5|I'm hooked on this show. It gives you a glimpse into the lives of people back when life was so different and everyone lived under a different set of rules. Everyone had their place (I'm glad things are different now but great entertainment to see what they were like back then).  It has a fabulous cast of characters and they play their roles well.
B000PC0S5K|5|More accessible than the older writings.  Well worth the time.
B00M7UTFW0|2|Not exactly what I expected and certainly not exactly scriptual. It was a combination of sci-fi and biblical and if you know the truth of what the scripture says you can get through it.  I suggest reading the story in the bible before watching it.
B004XUMMFE|5|Such an amazing show that was cancelled waaaaaaay before its time.
B007SGM084|5|With this series. I love the characters. I love the story. I love Christian Grey. I certainly hope we get the whole other side of it from his perspective. I couldn't put my kindle down, I had to know what happened. Just wow.

B00005JKHN|5|Two things stand out to me watching this film as an adult:<br /><br />1. How is it possible that after 16 years of living like mortals, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather have no clue how to bake or sew? There's no reason they should have gotten caught.<br />2. Why did they take Aurora back to the castle on her 16th birthday? After all those years of heartbreaking separation, 16 years and one day seems like no big deal and a lot safer.<br /><br />I love this movie because Maleficent is my favorite Disney villain. She is pure evil, but she is an amazing work of art. Disney always makes their villains so creative. The princesses usually look alike: small nose and chin, big eyes, long hair (typically), and a perfect body. Sidekicks and smaller characters are a little more unique: they get the big noses, huge chins, short squishy bodies, and proportions that even the most unattractive real-life people are not unfortunate enough to be blessed with. But the villains... they range from amazing to creative to unique to just plain weird. (Look at someone like Yzma in [[ASIN:B0060CV31C The Emperor's New Groove]]!) But Maleficent is the one who has always fascinated me the most. She's gorgeous even though she looks like a devil. There are times when you can't help sympathizing with her even though she's the bad guy. It's because you can tell she's lonely. And, like the fairies put it, she does not understand love. She has never been loved.<br /><br />Besides that, Eleanor Audley does the most amazing job ever as Maleficent. She's the quintessential villain voice. I guess that is why they used her again for the wicked stepmother in [[ASIN:B0007Z9R7A Cinderella (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]... another favorite villain of mine. It's a shame that they did Cinderella III so many years later that none of the original actors were around. Although whoever did the stepmother's voice did a pretty decent imitation. (I really think there should be a time limit on sequels. Cinderella III was OK but Cinderella II totally sucked.) Oh, and if you ever watch [[ASIN:B0000V4906 Green Acres: The Complete First Season]], you will not be able to watch Eleanor Audley without hearing Maleficent!but Cinderella II totally sucked.) Oh, and if you ever watch [[ASIN:B0000V4906 Green Acres: The Complete First Season]], you will not be able to watch Eleanor Audley without hearing Maleficent!
0385523912|5|I rarely review products on Amazon mostly because I usually don't have strong feeling either way to bother. In this case, I'm making an exception. This is an amazing book. I could not put it down.  By the end, I felt like I personally got to know each of the main characters - 6 people whose personal stories Demick used to write this book. I always wanted to know more about North Korea but after reading this book I almost feel like I got to know it too well.   Words of caution: this is not what you would call \\"light reading\\". At times, it is depressing and heart-wrenching. Sometimes you almost want to cry. Everything that happens on this book is real. But, in my opinion, this is what makes it so great.

1593080891|4|When commenting about the brilliant Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice is the most commonly discussed.  Though I must admit that Pride and Prejudice is my undisputed favorite from among those novels I have read by Ms. Austen, she does have many other great works.  Emma is yet another example of her unparalleled skills as a writer.  Most people find Austen's themes of romance most interesting but her novels, Emma in particular, are peppered with a great deal of satire.  Austen manages to not only create an engaging story but also to criticize the ridged society in which she lived.  In all of the Jane Austen novels that I have read she has created a humorous character who seems to talk far too much and make herself ridiculous to everybody; that character in this story is Mrs. Bates.  Though Mrs. Bates long speeches did often get annoying they were not without humor and it seems obvious that Austen was poking fun at many of the women in her society.  Though it took me a while to get through this book I did thoroughly enjoy it and was further convinced of Jane Austen being one of the greatest writers to ever live.  This novel rather contrasted both Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility in the fact that the heroin was not an underprivileged young woman who was lifted up from inferior circumstance.  Instead, Emma was born into a high circle of society and a great deal of money.  It was not her who was looked down on but she who looked down on others and while she was generally well meaning she was not without her pride and sense of superiority.  I had a bit of a difficult time relating to Emma's character as opposed to those of Elizabeth Bennett or Elinor Dashwood who were both more level headed and loveable.  I always enjoy Jane Austen's novels and I am very glad that I read Emma.  I would most certainly suggest it!
0394873742|5|This is a great book for toddlers and preschoolers, it's as big as they are and chock full of Scarry's signature illustrations. Even though this book is tall, it is very thin and slides behind a toychest or headboard  easily.
B004VMVTNU|3|I originally rated this app a give star app. I'm dropping it a star because it dots not adjust for daylight savings. I could live with it for falling back because out just woke me up an hour early, but this will be unacceptable if out is ask still a problem by the time we spring forward.  I had set the alarm on saturday night for sunday morning. The alarm said it was set for &quot;X&quot; hours from now. The time on my phone changed automatically, but the alarm still went off &quot;X&quot; hours from when it was set.
0312995423|2|Dan Brown has failed to live up to his standard in this one. The storyline is weak, the coincidences too choreographed, the characters too diabolical ... Overall, the story is great in parts but the key and critical areas are seriously flawed:<br /><br />- TRANSLATR is melting down and there is no emergency response method triggered? Only 3 people know about the condition? Apparently fire codes don't apply to a $2BB investment.<br /><br />- Chatrukian's body short circuits TRANSLATR, and there is no automatic shut-off? Heck, if my toaster overheats, the MCG trips off!<br /><br />- The \\"Virtual Reality' view of system security shields 'thinning' as attackers approach the database is extremely childish. Shrek was more believable.<br /><br />If you like combinations of cliched images threaded together with verbose verbiage, this one is for you.
B00BD99JMW|2|I really wanted to give Roth the benefit of the doubt with this one. But after reading the book twice, it's just not good, and a really disappointing way to end what was otherwise an engaging and fun series.<br /><br />First, the switched perspectives are impossible to tell apart, as others have said. I thought Four would be more reserved, stoic and provide an interesting look into his and Tris's relationship, but it's really just a lot of the same with a different name. The plot twist I would have loved, if it hadn't been done so poorly. I didn't even know anything had really happened until a few chapters later, at which point I had to go back and re-read. There's a way to do shocking and interesting but it needs to be meaningful. Roth's shocking felt like it was there for the sake of shocking people, rather than for the sake of a good story.<br /><br />All in all, this isn't terrible but it's not on par with the series and it's not a good way to end the book. I really expected more.
B0000AM6IY|5|This re-telling of Romeo and Juliet still resonates, some 50 years after it first appeared in<br />movie theaters. Wonderful music! and the cross-cultural romance is very contemporary, while<br />being timeless.

B000JMKQX0|5|The book has a different approach to the zombie theme. It doesn't tell the story from a single person or group perspective, but from different perspectives, showing many aspects of the war, like the early outbreaks, the failures of the governments, the strategies to fight back, what went wrong, etc., always as told by individuals sharing their stories. Extremely well written and very clever.

0399229191|5|Eric Carle is one of America’s most beloved children’s author. He has published over seventy books since 1965 and any child worth their literary salt is familiar his seminal works “The Very Hungry Caterpiller” and “Brown Bear, Brown Bear What Do You See?”. We read those two books on a regular basis to our children. Our oldest daughter was even able to recite them by the time she was three.<br /><br />The book I’m reviewing today, The Very Busy Spider, is one of Carle’s lesser know works (it doesn’t even have a Wikipedia page) so when I saw a hardbound copy on sale for only $1.00 I jumped at the chance to add this rare piece to our collection.<br /><br />It bears Carle’s distinctive writing style and illustrative prowess. Much like his award winning book “Polar Bear, Polar Bear What Do You Hear?”, this work captures the distinctive voices of the animal kingdom like only Eric Carle can. The artwork is vibrate and bright as usual, but it showcases a progression towards fine details that “Brown Bear” lacks. The Very Busy Spider even includes textured paint to enhance the reading experience. Children not only hear and see the story, but get to feel the story. Unfortunately the narrative left me wondering just what message was being conveyed to impressionable children.<br /><br />The Very Busy Spider follows a the exploits of an arrogant and haughty Spider who flies “across the field” – presumably from the city – to start a new life in the country. She settles onto an idyllic farm and begins to set up her household. The peaceful and quaint members of the farm community quickly arrive to embrace their new neighbor. The narcissistic Spider, however, refuses to speak or even acknowledge their existence.<br /><br />Countless neighbors offer a warm welcome to their town’s newest resident by inviting her to enjoy the various recreational opportunities the farm has to offer. Whether it’s swimming, running, napping, or some other activity, each invitation is silently rebuffed. In a chilling turn of events, one resident, a Rooster, invites Spider to play a game of “catch the fly” with him, but Spider kills the fly and silently stares him down until he leaves in shock. She’s so arrogant that she even scorns the praise she receives on her house building abilities!<br /><br />Regrettably my daughter loves this book and often wants me to read it multiple times in a single sitting. Despite my reservations I have continued to oblige her. However recently she has begun exhibiting, although more vocally than Spider, a similar self-centered attitude. She often screams when she wants a toy or second helpings at dinner rather than asking politely. She has even begun ignoring simple directions and requests. My hope is that this is just a general phase that all two-year old children experience and that it’s not the result of emulating Spider. Only time will tell if I have made a grave error in allowing this book onto our shelves.<br /><br />Read with caution.each invitation is silently rebuffed.

B004TTZHBK|3|I did not install videos and had no force close issues.  My biggest complaint is about some of the shortcuts.  I noticed the curries recipes rely on pastes that you may not have in your local store.  It would be useful to know the content of those pastes so you could attempt those recipes out here in the midwest.  However, I can see where those pastes enable you to pull off the meal in 20 minutes.
B000002UAU|5|I have read the reviews of this album and I have a few &quot;bones to pick&quot; with those we feel this album is overrated or have any negative views on this. One post stated that this album is far behind in the times  since other acts like Cream or Hendrix had far better stuff.  First of all  Sgt. Pepper is a piece that is innovative in several ways. It is the first  concept album (whether or not you think it is, it was still the first to be  called such), it is also the first to have lyrics, and be a package in  itself, among other things.  Also acts like those named admired Pepper, and  Hendrix even opened a show with it in Britain a mere two days after its  release. Another review said that Pepper wasn't even in the top ten of the  list of albums of the 60s. First, what I'd like to know is what list is  this? Top American albums perhaps? This person went on to say that Pet  Sounds was first and that was far better than Sgt. Pepper.  I have two  responses to this.  One is that Pet Sounds was inspired by Rubber Soul  another Beatles album.  Second is, that once Brian Wilson heard Pepper, he  was so knocked out by it he felt nothing he could do would measure up to  it.  Anyone who critices the Beatles should examine the facts. First, the  Beatles have been named the all time best sellers of rock and roll with 106  (or so) million sales. Next is Garth Brooks with 89 million and after last  is Elvis way in the dust with 69 million.  Where are Cream, Hendrix, Led  Zeppelin and the Beach Boys?  Second the Beatles are selling more albums  today, some 30 years after they broke up than they were when they were  together. Now that is longevity.  Last, the Beatles have been cited as the  greatest influence on rock and roll. Dismissing the Beatles can be an  aesthetic claim, and I respect that. Everyone is entitled to their own  likes and dislikes. But consider the facts, before you start citing  extraneous, meaningless opinions about the greatest group of all time (as  proven, this is not only my opinoin, but it is FACT).
B0034JKZ86|1|I had high hopes for this movie, as it has really bothered me that Disney has not had an African-American princess -- it's positively shameful -- and I was excited about the hand-drawn nature of the movie. I also thought the music was going to be wonderful as the film is set in New Orleans.<br /><br />Well, what a disappointment. I was hoping for a spoonful of magical Disney sugar on par with \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" or \\"The Little Mermaid\\". What I got was a dried-up packet of NutraSweet.<br /><br />Meticulous animation cannot save a cold story with no emotion or soul. As other posters have remarked, the writing for this film is on par with a Saturday morning cartoon. There's no flash, dash, or cleverness; no laugh-out-loud moments or times you want to cry. It's all been done before, and better ... the movie is full of worn-out cliches.<br /><br />There's no plot to speak of, just aimless wondering around. Where is the excitement of mise-en-sc&egrave;ne and personalities we felt in the bayou of \\"The Rescuers\\"? The animation is Hallmark-card perfect (too perfect), and the characters are boring, underdeveloped, and goody-goody. Dr. Facilier, the character everyone says is so thrilling, overacts so badly I felt like I was watching an avatar in a cheap video game. The director should have told him to add some nuance. Poor Tiana is a cardboard cutout on par with a character you'd find on a box of cereal. Where is the soul we saw in Belle, Arial, and even Meg from \\"Hercules\\"?<br /><br />The story itself is full of holes that you could drive Cinderella's carriage through -- for example, at the end of the movie, a major plot point revolves around someone inexplicably failing to kiss a frog before a clock chimes -- it makes no sense. She had the frog right in her hand -- huh? And the clock -- come on. You can never top the clock in \\"Cinderella\\", so why in the world make a half-baked attempt to even try?<br /><br />I am disturbed that we do not see much of Tiana as Tiana. It is nonsensical that she is a frog for most of the movie -- I have my suspicions that Disney was afraid that having an African-American face on the screen was just too daring, so they made her into a frog for almost the whole movie. Someone pinch me, is it 2010 or 1810? This character and the little girls who came to see her deserved better.<br /><br />The music ... don't get me started. Where were the big hits that we heard in movies like \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and \\"Sleeping Beauty\\"? Why couldn't they give us magnificent music like in \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\\"? Is this pap the best the very highly-paid Disney people could command? I could write better songs beeping the buttons on my cell phone.<br /><br />This movie is not only soulless, it's a crying shame. This is not what Disney is all about. If only the Blue Fairy could swoop down and wave her magic wand and give this cartoon a soul. She brought Pinocchio to life but she would not be able to do a thing with this dud.he movie -- I have my suspicions that Disney was afraid that having an African-American face on the screen was just too daring, so they made her into a frog for almost the whole movie.

B003AO1SVS|5|Ok, I'm 51, and maybe that's why I thought of Marc Bolan & T-Rex when this thing hit me? Something about the catchy melodies, the sound, the groove, the riffs, the vocals, the energy... Like T-Rex with the blues touch... Anyway: Really great stuff!
0811879542|5|I bought this book for my granddaughter, who is 3 1/2.  She loves it and wanted me to read it over and over again.  When I got tired of reading it, she took over and read it to some of her &#34;imaginary&#34; friends.  It was very very cute.  What a clever book that gets the children truly involved in the story by having them follow simple directions, and then they turn the page to see the results of what they did.  A book that really holds their interest.

B006Y9BVRM|5|Other the length of shipping time, almost 2 weeks, I am very satisfied with the Seiko. After setting it, it's lost maybe a second or two in 3 weeks. I would warn about tightening the push button locking collars as it's easy to over-tighten them. I used a wooden clothes pin to get a grip on the knurled collar to loosen it! The watch looks great.<br /><br />Mac Morgan

B005GVW05Q|5|Now a sober man with a Hollywood wife, a Hollywood house and his own record label, Pax Am, Ryan Adams has released the first record of his second act, a mellow and warm singer/songwriter effort called Ashes & Fire. The two things you're bound to hear about this record - if you're the investigative type - is that: 1) The record is quite mellow and fells like something of a brother to Neil Young's Harvest and After the Goldrush; and 2) Adams has become, maybe above all else, an incredible vocalist.    In a 2001 interview, following the release of his make-or-break sophomore solo release, Gold, Adams spoke about his then-strict routine, where he forced himself to spend an hour each day working on songwriting, an hour each day practicing guitar and an hour or more each day singing. It was no surprise then that, following Gold, Adams became one of the most prolific - and consistent - songwriters of his generation, releasing 12 albums between his breakthrough release, 1997's Stranger's Almanac, and today's Ashes & Fire. All along it's been said that Adams was a heavy user, living out the mission set forth in his 2001 song \\"Firecracker,\\" where he sand \\"Everyone wants to go forever / I just want to burn up hard and bright.\\" Clearly, things have changed, and Ashes & Fire is the document.    What first took my attention was the look of the record. Adams, also a painter and novelist, had never struck me as a man with an overall aesthetic like, say, Thom Yorke or Jack White. That is, not one to speak too highly of. Mostly, Adams - for me that is - was a lousy painter and poet who could make great, great songs that sometimes had very good lyrics. Then came Ashes, a beautifully presented record that begs me to believe that, as a sober adult, the man has more tolerance of the things outside the recording studio. And while the beautiful presentation of the record does seem distantly symbolic in relation to Our Man's transition from punk to adult, the real star of the show, as it should be, are the 11 songs - a collection Adams himself has already called his \\"best yet.\\"    Opener \\"Dirty Rain,\\" a delicate and detailed composition heaped with 70s-era style turns, certainly starts things off right, working as an introduction to the artist's new era. In the song (or so we assume), Adams narrates from a third person perspective, juxtaposing his early 2000s rock star residency in L.A. with his modern - and much more settled - tenure in the town (he inhabited New York City in the interim). A beautiful opening that will resonate deeply with his longtime fans, putting to rest the inevitable \\"he was better when he was stoned\\" chatter in a classy, admirable manner.    Track two, the record's title track, is the most upbeat offering of the collection, feeling like something of a celebration of the man's abilities. He howls, strums and bangs in a way only he can. You'd be hard pressed to find a working rock musician with the ability to make a song as classic-sounding as \\"Ashes & Fire.\\" Maybe they can sing as good as Adams, or arrange songs just as good. Or they're a strong songwriter, sure. But a master of all three key elements, at once, on one song? Classic tracks like this are rare. Very rare. But far less rare for Adams than most.    If you've heard the above-mentioned Young records and are familiar with Adams' records like Gold, 29, Easy Tiger and Jacksonville City Nights, then you should have a pretty good idea of what Ashes & Fire sounds like. Overall the record is consistently mellow and most definitely thick and warm. There are instant classics like \\"Save Me\\" and \\"Lucky Now\\" and slow burners like \\"Invisible Riverside.\\" The writing isn't his most interesting to date but the singing soars like never before and the arrangements are heartbreakingly beautiful. Sure, I'd like to see the guy stomp his boots a little more here and there (he's one of the best ever at that), and I know he has more adventurous records up his sleeve. But if you're looking forfront-to-back listenability, it's hard to top this collection sweetly twangy, surprisingly uplifting tunes. The biggest difference here is that, for the first time ever, Adams has offered up a collection of songs that feel, for the most part, wholly positive. Hopeful. Tender. He rarely went there before (only \\"Dance All Night\\" and \\"So Alive\\" come to mind at the moment), to that positive place in his songwriting heart, but when he did, it was always damn good. Rest assured, Ashes & Fire, a new era Ryan Adams for sure, continues the streak, but with a new twist. His best since 2007's classic Easy Tiger.    97/100    Read more of my music- and film-related writing at [...]

B00003CXA2|1|This movie proves along with titanic that people in the 90's have no idea what a great or even good movie looks like. The 1st thing a great movie needs is a story with a point. Just jumping from place to place is beyond dumb, not to mention a man with Gump's IQ making it big in life. But the real reason this movie should never have been made is that it kept the best movie of the 90's (pulp fiction) from winning the awards it should have. In 50 years people will stil talk about Pulp no one will even see Gump.
B00IK590UI|5|Different than the original, but decent action and enjoyable!  I recommend this movie.
B0007P3582|1|The fact that this album is the top selling album of the year just shows how musical taste amongst the kids nowdays has deteriated.  It is said that John Lennon once wrote a great song in ten minutes.  50 Cent couldn't write a great song in ten years!   <br /> <br />Trivia: How 50 Cent got his name: <br />When he was poor and living on the streets instead of asking for quarters he would ask for 50 cent pieces.  Either he was very greedy or he thought it was cool and different.  <br /> <br />As for the album itself there is not one redeeming vaule about it whatsoever.  It is truly a massacre on your mentality.  The biggest hit off the album, \\"Candy Shop\\", talks about licking lollipops, riding women like low riders and other things I can't talk about here on this site.  Now isn't that exactly what kids need to hear nowdays?  And we wonder why AIDS and other STDs are so rampant today.  Regardless this song topped the charts and kids who are brainwashed on MTV buy it and listen to it. <br /> <br />The word N****** and the F word are used more often than the words, \\"the\\", or \\"it\\".  Women are no longer called women but are called ho's and other degrading terms.  No, I didn't buy the album, but I've heard enough from what my peers at my local college listen to to get the idea.  Kids I know were fine until they started listening to this album and now they can't say a single sentence without letting a profane word slip <br /> <br />On a postive note, I'm glad he survived getting shot because no person deserves to die regardless of how badly they messed up the world.  I'm certainly not glad that he is poisoning the world with his profanity and demented philosophy.  You're better off spending your money on a classic rock or classic pop album than this garbage.

B00IRISI42|5|A classic David Balducci type of adventure.
B007CKNX28|5|One of the best CDs I've bought in a long time. The music is almost uniformly good and it's incredibly diverse. It reminds me of some of the albums that came out in the 1970s in that there's a little country, some raunchier blues tunes, outright rockers, a poppy Kinksian ditty, and a few that defy classification. The songs and production are more inventive than I would have ever expected from White despite his success with his bands over the years. Really good stuff!!
B009FZHYKU|4|I really enjoy this show, and have watched it ever since getting into it right after the second season finished airing. While at times the story seems to drag or lack direction, it does always get somewhere, and usually with a satisfactory amount of action.
B009LDCZ7I|5|It was ok
B00P42WROG|5|Typically excellent King!!
B001BZRUR4|5|I had to read all of what Markus Zusak wrote.  I devoured this and his other 2 works.  I am glad two of the 3 are on my Kindle, as I will reread them.  His words take you right where the story is.  I love his Aussie slang as I have spent a good bit of time in the UK and know British English and now some great new slang.  His words transform the ordinary to the extraordinary.
B008Y7CGO4|1|We watched about 5 minutes of the film and that was giving the film the benefit of the doubt for 4.5 minutes. Please save your 5 min and just PaSS this bye.
B001WCBPCW|5|From the first time I popped this CD in and started listening to it, I have not been disappointed. For me the mark of a really great album is one that feels like the artist is telling a story from the first track to the last. Not once have I been tempted to skip over any songs (as usually happens with most albums). In fact, I've had this CD playing nonstop for hours at a time and still haven't tired of it. I first discovered Kasabian several years ago and have always been pleased with their first self-titled CD. When Empire came out, I didn't initially embrace it as I have with West Ryder, although recently I've been listening to Empire again and have discovered a few jewels on the album that I didn't get the first time around. Kasabian have definitely made it into my Top 5 favorite bands and West Ryder is truly an excellent release. If you don't own it already, pick it up and you won't be sorry.

B0000029DD|4|When I first heard Grace I was blown away, thinking it the greatest debut album ever. But I had just been reading the biography of Buckley and his father, and I think I was so enthralled by the story that I thought more highly of the music than I should have.  Not all the songs herein are works of genius, although there are several: the title song; the glorious cover of Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\" (you'll never be able to listen to the Shrek soundtrack again); and a couple of flat-out rockers that make you scratch your head wondering why Buckley never got any airplay.  And that voice! It's been called a mix of Robert Plant and Dino Vinelli, and it is, but that doesn't do it justice.  On \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\" he sounds like a eunuch, yet he can get down and dirty on songs like \\"So Real\\" or \\"Eternal Life.\\"  And the CD ends on a transcendent note with \\"Dream Brother,\\" a tribute to his equally doomed father. Like Dad, Jeff could be a showboat with the voice, but if I had that voice I'd probably want to show it off too.

B00L9B7IKE|5|Great read! Amazing, and shocking ending.
0679882820|5|Good quality binding on the book. Should hold up well to my little person.
B002C1BHIO|5|This had the heavy duty quality I wanted at a decent price.   I used it to replace a cheaper, damaged product and believe this new one will easily withstand the environment that did the first one in.    This has a much stronger feel.  It may not work in places with tight/very short twists and turns, but it traverse well between the components of my entertainment console.
B00EL8I8IS|5|Well composed
B008Y768XO|5|A truly feel good movie

B00005JPAJ|4|Babel <br /> <br />Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has completed his trilogy of human sadness and isolation with his final installment of Babel.  His previous films in the trilogy are 21 Grams and Amores Perros.  His latest is an intense, depressing, and brilliant look into the way which we as humans perform miscommunication. <br /> <br />Babel is derived from the biblical story when man tried to reach heaven via a tower.    Upset with the idea, God stopped the construction by creating different languages.  Communication had become impossible. <br /> <br />The film is blessed with exceptional acting all around from actors and actresses of whom you probably have never heard.  Okay, everyone is familiar with Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt but the rest of the cast is mostly of no names, at least to  people here in America. <br /> <br />Babel easily could have been a lazy effort made by Director Inarritu.  How so?  A film with a running length of 142 minutes centered upon a simple idea of miscommunication doesn't sound very challenging, right?  Wrong.  This is where Inarritu has gone above and beyond.  It would have been all too easy for his characters to not communicate simply because of language.  Although the film does contain this aspect, the focus is primarily on the miscommunication of humans with the same language. <br /> <br />Richard (Pitt) and Susan (Blanchett) are on vacation in Morocco when a random bullet strikes Susan creating a chain of events for the viewer.  Yes, Richard has trouble communicating to the locals about getting help, but look closer.  A scene before this shows the couple unhappy with each other because of their child's death.  Their miscommunication with each other has created a break in their relationship. <br /> <br />The random bullet is revealed to have been shot from two children who have a brother sibling rivalry with each other.  The father's treatment of the younger brother causes the older brother to feel inadequate.  Adding tothe mix, the younger brother is confused and curious about his sexuality as he watches his sister undress (which she fully knows and fully enjoys the attention).  This indeed is a family that lacks in the area of communication of their problems. <br /> <br />Richard and Susan's kids are taken care of by mexican nanny Amelia (Adriana Barraza).  Amelia is thrown into a probable predicament.  Amelia has her brother's wedding to attend in Mexico but Richard (because of his inability to listen) has insisted that she has no choice but to take care of his kids on her day off.  So what does she do?  Irresponsibly, she takes the kids with her to Mexico for the wedding and plans on bringing them back across the border into the States.  It's funny how going into Mexico sure is easier than coming back.  On the way back, she experiences the vigorous and ruthless laws of immigrating back into the U.S.  It's too bad the border patrol and Amelia refuse to listen to each other.  A tragedy of ghastly proportions ensues. <br /> <br />Meanwhile in Japan, Yasujiro (Koji Yakusho) is linked to the gun that has fired off the bullets.  He and his deaf daughter Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi) are having father-daughter problems.  The suicide of Chieko's mother has caused a lack of emotions and communication between the father and daughter.  Both feel distant as a family, but Chieko's isolation continues into her social life.  Men don't want to have anything to do with Chieko because she is deaf.  This yearning of acceptance causes Chieko to communicate in the only way she knows possible, her body.  The show stopper occurs in a scene where Chieko stands fully nude in front of a detective.  Chieko has been stripped of her dignity appearing completely desperate and vulnerable.  Simply put, Rinko Kikuchi's character Chieko is the most fascinating and best part of the film. <br /> <br />As you can see, this is not a film merely about characters not understanding each other via language barriers.  There ismuch more substance going on.  Many of the film's lack of communication takes place within people who speak the same language but are not listening to each other and therefore not communicating.    <br /> <br />The film may feel slow to some and yet engaging to others.  The whole \\"every character is connected\\" idea seems overplayed and not as shocking as it once was.  This is largely due to previous films, such as Crash, exercising this same idea in the past (I still think P.T. Anderson's Magnolia is the best film that shows an interweaving complex story of characters that all connect.)   <br /> <br />But still, Inarritu has made a film showing that even though our cultures have led us to have different definitions of happiness with one another, we are all still connected as human beings because of the similarities of tragedy, death, and isolation we all feel.  To the core, we are all the same.   <br /> <br />Listen to this film, you will be rewarded.
B001E7OO2I|3|There are a couple John Legend songs on this CD I found worth playing - \\"Ready To Go\\" an upbeat but difficult to dance to party grind and another I can't name but think is track 7 (or 8). Other than those two tracks this CD is somewhat less than exciting to the point of being uninspired. John really is a very accomplished musician and producer with a sophisticated ear for contemporary composition and arrangement but . . . \\"Evolver\\" does not really begin to showcase John's talent - and for me that meant alot of track skipping to find something worth listening to that wasn't preachy, whimsical or boring. I found this CD much less than memorable and once it's replaced in \\"rotation\\" in the CD player it probably won't be played again.
B009CPES4I|2|Fabulous cast, intriguing idea, yet a disappointment. First half is stronger but the second half falls into unbelievable bordering on ridiculous. Total waste of a talented, seasoned cast. Fun to see them together, though. I had higher expectations, and they were certainly not met.
B00B0NDQPC|4|A well done album, worth listening too many times. My personal favorite is the 'The Object of My Affection'. Worth the price of admission
B0026RHR6K|5|I bought all of the seasons separately as they first came out, and I highly recommend watching the entire television series through to the end. The five stars are for the series, NOT for the atrocious marketing.<br /><br />While looking for the last piece of the series (see the end of the review), I came across some great deals (in terms of price), but was dismayed to see just how confusing things have become on Amazon. This review below is meant to help you wade through the mess in the marketplace, purchase the series, and enjoy it. I originally posted it for the combined Seasons 4.0 and 4.5 set, but someone kindly suggested I post it elsewhere as well. I hope you find it helpful.<br /><br />DVD CONFUSION<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />The show is incredible. However, the whole DVD thing has been a disaster. They released it in the worst way possible (see below), Amazon compounded the problem by lumping together reviews for DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, and the DVD manufacturers seem to be changing the contents of some products. I cannot imagine how someone who is not deeply familiar with it is supposed to purchase this wonderful show. Certainly, they would hesitate to give it as a gift! Let's hope this solves your problem.<br /><br />In one sentence, I can say that here is what you want to get: Seasons 1, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4.0, 4.5, and The Plan. I have links to them below. If you get these, then you will be sure to have it all.<br /><br />========================================<br /><br />-Season One was released as ([[ASIN:B000AJJNFE Battlestar Galactica  - Season One]]) altogether with the pilot in one box.<br />-Season Two was released as [[ASIN:B000BNI90Y Battlestar Galactica - Season 2.0 (Episodes 1-10)]] and [[ASIN:B000GFLEAO Battlestar Galactica: Season 2.5 (Episodes 11-20)]] in two boxes. You can now purchase them together as [[ASIN:B000NOIVV8 Battlestar Galactica (2004): Seasons 2.0 & 2.5]]<br />-Season Three was released together in one box as [[ASIN:B00129W6LE Battlestar Galactica - Season Three]].<br />-Season Four was released as [[ASIN:B001HUWQEA Battlestar Galactica - Season 4.0]] and [[ASIN:B001HZXYDC Battlestar Galactica: Season 4.5]] with the Razor episode. Those are now available together as [[ASIN:B003IVXR5S Battlestar Galactica (2004): Season 4.0 & 4.5]]. Occasionally I come across things like \\"Battlestar Galactica: Season 4.5 - Limited Edition Gift Set (2009).\\" It seems like a lot of money for one part of the full season, but you get some dog tags with it, so if you are into collecting memorabilia, you might want to consider it.<br />-The Plan was released on its own as [[ASIN:B002HRF68A Battlestar Galactica: The Plan]]<br /><br />========================================<br /><br />OPTIONS FOR PURCHASING THEM ALL TOGETHER: BAD TO GOOD<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with COLLECTIBLE CYLON). Not recommended. I do not own this, but according to the reviews, it is packaged poorly WITHOUT AN EPISODE LIST. That seems like a horrible idea for four seasons of a tv show. Apparently, it contains the same DVDs as the ones sold separately (explained above).<br />-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (the one in the GRAY BOX). Recommended. I do not own this. Good reviews of it so far. Packaging problems were fixed.<br />-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with COLLECTIBLE CYLON) [BLU-RAY] or the gray box [BLU-RAY] set. Recommended. I do not own this. Seems to include some extras, but not significant. It also has an episode list, according to the reviews. It might be worth buying if you wanted to get everything together.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />As far as I can tell from the reviews, I think there are two choices:<br />(1) Buy either Blu-Ray set or the DVD set in the gray box.<br />(2) Purchase everything separately (make sure to get all ofthe stuff mentioned above).<br /><br />NOTE:<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />-The \\"Face of the Enemy\\" webisodes (episodes shown only online) have not been made available for purchase in any of the sets as far as I can tell. What a shame!<br />-Also, if anyone sees any mistakes in this review, please tell me and I will edit it. Frustratingly, the manufacturers seem to be changing the contents of some sets, so it is possible that my information has become outdated.the stuff mentioned above).<br /><br />NOTE:<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />-The \\"Face of the Enemy\\" webisodes (episodes shown only online) have not been made available for purchase in any of the sets as far as I can tell.

B00OGTDZP8|5|Prepare to fall in love.  You’ve been warned.<br /><br />I mean, yes, Grace (the author), and Ryosuke (author’s husband) seem sweet and kind and very much in love, but they’re not the only part of the story by which you’ll be charmed.  Grace (hereafter as “GBM”) and Ryosuke (“RM”) are obviously both bright and good souls.  In this book, you’ll see Tokyo through the eyes of someone not native to Japan (GBM), but one who looks and thinks and asks endless questions about life, love, and (insert random subject here), and her loving “mirror” – her “other half” (RM) has questions and comments, as well.  While you may be momentarily distracted by the apparent non-sequitur, hang on.  You, too, will be drawn along down the “rabbit hole”, and soon, it will all make sense, because GBM’s world is full of strangers who are merely friends you haven’t yet met.  Though the book has endless mini-guides about things to understand and to do in Japan, you’ll find that the greater part of this wonderland isn’t in the cityscape of Tokyo, but in the neighborhoods of their hearts and minds.<br /><br />Charming, thoughtful, and deceptively simple, the book will set you up with silly cartoons, and then blind-side you with thoughtful insights that don’t usually come from a twenty-something-year-old.  You’ll know why they fell in love with each other.  This book will make you think, laugh, and see her world (and perhaps your own) with new eyes.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B0055S348W|1|Although I did &amp;#34;purchase&amp;#34; this app as the FAOTD, I will not actually download it onto any of my devices at this time. It ap p ears to be an awesome app, but the excessive permissions are seriously scary. NO app of this nature needs to have access to, and the ability to add, delete and modify, my accounts, texts, calks, browser history, etc. That is extreme in my opinion and completely unnecessary for the functionality of a printing companion app. If the permissions are modified in the future, I will happily use the app!!

B00A8ECU24|5|When it comes to pay-to-play games, this one is fun. You get all the main ponies as storyline quests, and all of the other ponies you can buy using in game currency, with some of the more special ponies like Zecora and Celestia being available through purchased currency and social media connectivity currency. Overall though, for being a town creator, its fun and the mini games are a nice diversion.

B000002J1Y|4|This 1973 live recording shows a few technical signs of its age, and yet it is a gem of Yes's early years.  There are some places where the sound quality is less than stellar, and yet 1973 was when Yes was young and energetic and had a bold artistic vision that sometimes met with the approval and critics and fans, and just as often did not.  What remains is that Yes had sufficient success to be experimental in their music and the talent to frequently turn their experiments into interesting music.<br /><br />The opening of the first CD is a portion of Stravinsky's \\"Firebird Suite.\\"  Opening live albums with an instrumental portion has been done by other artists with varying success, and this introduction seems a bit underpowered, though well performed.  The opening leads to \\"Siberian Khatru,\\" which is similarly well performed.  The weakness of this track is that the bass seems too subdued and the high notes a bit strong, even with my speakers biased towards the lower notes.<br /><br />The album continues with \\"Heart of the Sunrise,\\" again well performed, sounding a lot like the original album, with the exception that Jon Anderson's voice in live performances often sounds much less polished than his studio performances.  \\"Perpetual Change\\" follows with fourteen plus minutes of rock.  Again, the instruments are the power as Jon's voice often fades to a much lower volume or into the background.<br /><br />\\"And You and I\\" has a strong opening that is easily heard.  The live version offers some variation from the studio version.  Jon's vocal is a little strange as it appears his voice was varying in volume, particularly during the opening, though his singing on this song is otherwise well done, stronger and smoother than on the earlier tracks.  Indeed, the vocals in general are stronger on this track than on the previous tracks, though Jon fails to hold a long note at about five minutes into the track.  This song is classic Yes and includes everything that was ever good about progressive rock.<br /><br />A change of pace is provided by the acoustic guitar instrumental \\"Mood for a Day.\\"  Surprisingly, this song sounds better than the studio version.  The combination of the crowd sounds with the slight echo from performing in a large area and the variation in playing all make this instrumental a gem.<br /><br />Rick Wakeman, who established himself as an experimental solo artist, plays excerpts from \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII.\\"  As those who have heard \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" can attest, Rick Wakeman's music translates well when played live.  While I am unsure why, the result is nearly always impressive, and this instrumental impresses me even now.  Crank up the volume on this one, just make sure that everything loose is tied down, particularly if you have a sub-woofer and you've got the bass cranked all the way up to maximum and most especially in the last minute of the music.<br /><br />\\"Roundabout,\\" one of Yes's numerous signature songs, takes up the last eight and a half minutes of the first CD.  The transition from the previous track to this one is seamless, and you hardly know you are into the next song until the guitars start, and of course \\"Roundabout\\" is instantly recognizable.  Once again, the music is good, the vocals are only fair.<br /><br />The second CD starts with yet another signature Yes song, \\"I've Seen All Good People.\\"  This seven minute track is the shortest song on this CD, and features good vocals, both by Jon Anderson and the backing vocals.  This track is one of the best on this CD and offers a worthwhile variation from the studio album.<br /><br />The next track combines \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" with \\"The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus).\\"  This thirteen minute track starts as you would expect it to, but about two-thirds way through the track this song diverts substantially from the studio track and explodes into a rousing rock explosion before returning once again to the music of \\"The Fish.\\"The end of this track is a lot of fun also.<br /><br />\\"Close to the Edge\\" consists of more than eighteen minutes of rock explorations that follow the original studio version.  The sound on this song is generally good and enjoyable to hear.  The vocals are surprisingly good as well.  As good an eighteen minutes of live progressive rock as you'll hear anywhere.  \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" follows with yet another fourteen plus minutes of enjoyable progressive rock.  It seems the further into the second disk you go the better the music gets.  The guitar work on this song is well done and interesting and enjoyable to listen to.<br /><br />The last song is yet another signature Yes song.  \\"Starship Troopers\\" was loosely inspired by the Robert A. Heinlein novel by the same name.  This last song, clocking in at more than 10 minutes, is an excellent way to end this CD.  The music is well performed and the vocals, while a bit weak in a couple of places, are generally good.  The ending of this song shows Yes at their playful best.<br /><br />I am rarely fond of live albums.  Often the production values are much less than studio albums, and there are sufficient flaws to render the music grating.  While this live album suffers from some flaws, most particularly in the vocals, the music itself is good, and the music on the second CD is very good.  I count this live CD as one of the better live CDs I have heard and own.  Hardcore fans of Yes will likely want to have this one as well as those who have attended a Yes concert and want to recall the memorable experience.of \\"The Fish.\\"  The end of this track is a lot of fun also. <br /> <br />\\"Close to the Edge\\" consists of more than eighteen minutes of rock explorations that follow the original studio version.

1451666179|5|This is a fantastic little book.  It is a super quick read, and I was a little disappointed that I had already read many of the stories on her blog, but there are some new ones in there also, and they didn't disappoint!
B00005QZWI|3|Well, I collect soundtracks, and classical music is my main area of expertise.  The \\"Lord\\" had potential in both areas, but left me expecting more.  Maybe I'm jaded, but I  really like Bruckner's overblown symphonic works which often provide more sonic satisfaction.  But for \\"The Lord...\\" The score is so massive that one has to play it on equipment that can easily handle the nuances.  It is expansive, and overblown.  Are all the tracks overdupped and enhanced?  The choral sequences sounded as though the Mormon Tabernacle Choir had met the Festival Singers of Wales in the Grand Canyon. Of course, there were some powerful moments, and tender ones, too, but over all, I was left saying, \\"So...?\\". And where was Enya?  A big, juicy sticker on my copy proclaimed that this was another hit for Enya!  I had been  reviewing other soundtracks  for  publications (\\"Harry Potter\\", for one), and I thought that one was much more interesting, and a stand-alone disc.  So, off to see \\"The Lord...\\", for another shot.  Maybe I will enjoy it more. Maybe I had an off-day. This may be one I'll put in the resale bin....Madge Bruner Hazen
B00000IBRX|1|I absolutely hated this film, it's on my worst 5 of all time. I can't exactly say what made it such a frustrating experience but I walked out of the theater thinking that I would rather be run over by a semi than be  forced to sit through another screening of this film. I love Williams, Cuba  was amazing in Boys in the Hood, and the visuals were spectacular, but the  film was so bad that even the great FX didn't allow me to give it more than  1 star. Probably the hardest movie to sit through of 1998, (and Armageddon  came out the same year!)
B00DYEBM3I|5|Waited a long time for a new album, and was little worried that it would be different from what I've come to expect from Mazzy Star.  That isn't an issue though, this album fits right into their catalog, from the first track, to the last, you absolutely know who you're listening to.  The CD jewel box is cardboard and there's no booklet or anything, so don't get your hopes up for anything fancy if you order the CD.  No complaints at all, happy to see them touring and putting out fresh music.
0142000663|1|I am a Junior in High School and am instinctually drawn to literature.  This novel was a required reading, but that didn't spoil the story for me.  The story did that itself.  I have never been so bored in my life.  Honestly, I'm astounded to find that so many people \\"loved\\" this book.  While the story did have a great moral to go along with it, it was about dirt!  Dirt and migrating.  Dirt and migrating and more dirt.  I couldn't even sit down to read it for more than 15 minutes before dozing off.  What an awful summer read.  I even think I chucked it out the balcony once.  But please, decide for yourself.  Opinions on literature are very diverse, so make your own, and make sure not to operate heavy machinery while reading this one.  Things could get drowsy.

B000005HFH|5|Best is right.
B000000JO3|5|One of the best Discographies ever made!  You cannot go wrong with this disc.  If I was on an island with only 3 CD's this would be one of them. Every song is great although you can tell the difference between the 2 albums and the last EP as to the direction Minor Threat was going. Nothing beats the first tracks for raw power.  Classic songs that you will remember all the words after a few listens.  This CD is ALWAYS FRESH! You will never tire of it.  If you only have one hardcore punk CD and you want to pose this is the one that will still give you cred.  I might advise Black Flag Damaged as well.  These were the two albums my friend brought back from a Summer in Cali.  I think they were suggested and what great suggestions they were.  When I first heard both albums my head explodeded from the sound and I was hooked on hardcore punk from that day forward.  Probably my top genre just because the music never gets old.  If you've had a bad day or getting psyched for a good one you need to play this disc and play it LOUD!  When you sing along with the lyrics it's even better!  Nothing pumps you up like this teenage angst from the early 80's. The heyday of this sound.  I don't know get why nobody can recreate the hardcore punk sound of the early to mid 80's?  It seems so simple with 3 cords and catchy lyrics but it's if this sound was put in a bottle after 86 and thrown out to sea.  Impossible to duplicate today.  Nirvana gave the recorded sound a good shot with In Utero but the genre isn't the same of course.  Still it's the closest album that's come in raw sound to this recording period and that was only 10 years later.  I heard the Pixes tent was low on people when they played in Cali while all the kiddies went to listen to EDM.  I get it. Most chicks don't get down to this music but who cares?  It's fantastic!  IF you do find a girl that get's this music than hang onto her though because she's a keeper!  There is no way you can't be a fan of rock artist in general and not have at least appreciation for this disc. Impossible.  I know music is subjective and all but if you like voice,bass,guitar,and drums and cannot appreciate this sound then you are a lost cause.  Sorry but it's true. This is a MUST OWN!  I'm not going to break down every song because it's just too good a disc to even try to separate the songs.  There are 3 eras in this disc and that's all you need to know.  EVERY SONG IS GREAT! It's a symphony of hardcore for the angels!  This band couldn't have lasted and longer then they did because they were just going to shine brightly for a moment and flame out.  Like all the best things in life there is no way time could've stopped to keep this short moment of perfection any longer then it was. Put it in your cart and buy it. Don't waste anytime if you haven't heard it but just heard about it.  It really is that good.nd not have at least appreciation for this disc. Impossible.

B004GJDQT8|5|Great app
B00AHSIQWE|4|If you like action packed super-hero movies (which I do) I would recommend this movie.  This is also good finale (?) to the series of Batman movies.
B00004Z459|5|this is a great cd from the first track to the last this is my favorite cd I ever bought all of my friends think the same some of them didnt even know who they were then I played it for them and they ended up bying it
B004J4WKUQ|5|I'm not even done with this book yet, and I can tell you that for any gamer, or 80s lover, this is worth the read.<br />The writing is dynamic and interesting and there's a twist at the end of every tunnel.<br />So love.
B005COO1X6|4|This book is another fine example of what King does best; taking an everyday situation, turning it totally creepy and making you think twice before proceeding with your daily routine... just in case.
B004GJYRA0|5|Love this movie! Great price!

B0002VKZL6|5|My favorite album of 2004 and my favorite Knopfler work since Communique.  Lots of beautiful melodies that get stuck in my head and many touching, human lyrics.  Schmalzy on a couple tracks, but generally very moving and honest.    Fans of Money For Nothing, What It Is, and Sultans of Swing will probably be disappointed, however, because there are no extended guitar solos (fair warning!).  Other reader's comments/criticisms about the slowness of the album are fair, but for some reason that didn't bother me (it usually does... such as with the great Knopfler sleeping pill, Sailing to Philadelphia).  Fans who dig Clapton or Dylan are more likely to enjoy this album than fans of Jimi Hendrix or Van Halen.  It's more artsy-fartsy and less kick-[...], but it is top-notch artsy-fartsy.    After two months of listening, I still haven't gotten tired of the following tracks in the least: 5:15, Trawlerman's Song, and Postcards to Paraguay.  I'd especially suggest these for a listen.

B008Y2FRFO|5|Starts out a little slow but becomes addictive quickly
B005ZOBNOI|3|One of the best written, but saddest, books I've ever read. Loved Green's framing of Hazel's father.  He was so compassionate, yet macho. The whole story is a tear jerker about teens,  in love, in true love, fighting life threatening stuff. Cool beans!

0380973464|4|It's kind of like ish if David Foster Wallace was a wise old Native American storyteller who grew up in Lynnwood, Washington (ever heard of it?) in the 1970s. Even, it's sort of like as though Thomas Pynchon wrote  The Fountainhead, with William Gibson and Steven Covey collaborating on the  20th century stuff to make a cyber-spy novel about modern business success,  ethics, funny things people do, and the decoding of messages.  <br />Cryptonoicon is a big book about two generations of karmic, &quot;it's a  small world&quot; nuclear families. The kind of families full of  hard-striving, big-big-big characters.  They are basically divided into two  piles: streetwise jocks and smarter than peepee information transfer  engineers. The girls are different though. It's a funny book which  entertains, snowballs in fractal dimensions while building focus, and also  gave me lots to think and stare off into space about.<br />All through this  book Stephenson draws subtle resolutions of opposites (and conflicts of  complements): fathers and sons coming to discover and appreciate one  another, men and women growing their understanding of each other; coded  chaos becoming luminous, in an everyday way, through the actions taken by  the characters. The prose is fast and bright, and in my opinion this book  basically hits the ground running and builds steam from there.  <br />At its  heart, this book is about extracting information from chaos.  From the  start, I found myself enjoying and liking the characters.  It's  a fast  read if you do as Nils Bohr did and hum through the equations. This is a  clear, well written piece of art which is great in scope and unified in  detail.  Despite its paranoia, it is warmly human.  Just like you and  me.<br />The many typograxial errors mentioned in a previous review _are_ in  fact a code.  I just haven't figured it out yet.  The paper is crappy, and  to cover that up it's got the trendy &quot;deckled quarto&quot; edge or  whatever, I bet it will be yellow and falling apart in 25 years.  But then,  maybe I will be too.
B0063IH60K|5|I have been playing this solitaire game for years.  No flaws no kinks.  Perfect way to challenge yourself, against yourself.  I highly recommend this app.
B000006UD8|5|Deep Purple could easily have been as big as Led Zeppelin.  They were certainly as talented.  If only Ritchie Blackmore had got on better with Ian Gillan and Roger Glover, this classic line-up could have stayed together for a few more years, and clocked up true supergroup status.  And earned an awful lot of money.<br />But an inability to make compromises often goes with the territory of being highly talented.  Listening again to these remastered anniversary editions of 'In Rock', 'Fireball' and 'Machine Head' together with 'Rainbow Rising', I am strongly persuaded by the argument that Ritchie Blackmore has been rock's greatest post-Hendrix guitarist.<br />This was a re-master I had to buy.  'Machine Head' was the first album I ever bought.  For several months it was the only album I owned, so I played it to death.  Every piece of music brought into my boarding school had to be approved by the headmaster.  At the time, only 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' had been approved.  Rather than ask permission and get the album confiscated, I sneaked 'Machine Head' in to the school, intending to play it to myself on headphones.  But other boys -- we were 13-year-olds -- wanted their own copies, so a number of crude speaker-to-microphone recordings were made.  That summer, the sounds of 'Highway Star' and 'Pictures of Home' echoed around the subterranean cavern that was called the Model Club.  Fortunately this was not the era when hard-rock bands felt obliged to insert gratuitous four-letter words into their lyrics.  Despite the musical style of 'Machine Head' not nothing like the classical stuff that our teachers wanted us to aspire to, the album was not banned.  Strangely, 'Smoke on the Water' was NOT one of the tracks we paid much attention to.  It was only when I moved on the next term to another school -- one where boys could learn the guitar -- that I became aware of the legendary status this track was acquiring.<br />This 2CD set throws up an immediate dilemma: which to listen to first -- the Remixes or the Remasters?  I know every note of the original album, so the Remasters were my first port of call.  The recordings are clearer, but there's no particular revelation.<br />What is stunning -- and this is the reason why every Purple fan has to own this version -- are Roger Glover's Remixes.  Normally I am suspicious of remixes.  Today remixes are usually an excuse for another producer to cut and splice, re-order chorus and verse, and put down several new layers of synth and drum machine.  Glover has done none of that, but he has brought a fantastic clarity to the recordings.  Most tracks last a little longer, because Glover has left in an additional bar of music at the opening or at the very end.  Two tracks, including 'Smoke on the Water', have completely different solos.<br />In listening to the remixes, you feel very close to the stage of the Grand Hotel, Montreux.  There is a tremendous live feel to the recordings.  Extraordinarily for a band whose members couldn't abide each other, the level of empathy between the musicians is oustanding.  The interplay between Blackmore and Lord is wonderful.  (Now at last with the sonic clarity of the remixes I can just about be sure which bits are played by Lord and which by Blackmore.)  Even Glover's bass solo on 'Pictures of Home' sparkles.<br />Ian Gillan may have been casual about the writing of the lyrics, but Purple's music has lasted because the band put so much into the development of each track.  I found that it took many listens to fully appreciate all the nuances of their finest recordings.  That was, after all, part of the appeal of progressive music.  This anniversary set is a fitting testament to the greatest progressive hard rock band I have known.isten to first -- the Remixes or the Remasters?

0446677450|1|First of all, let me say that this book is certainly well written. I have no doubt that Kiyosaki is making a lot of money from these books. But, I ask you, take a real close look at these reviews. Is anybody posting success stories? And saying how? By naming names?<br />A great deal of this book is in the new style of motivational writing. Every page you read is selling this book. And while I certainly don't doubt that it can inspire a great many people, when you put this book down you find that you haven't learned anything new that hasn't been said before.<br />I was shocked to see that some of the things that Kiyosaki recommends are horribly outdated. For example, he goes into great detail how he bought foreclosed property for little money down, and then turned it around to make a profit. Hey, this was a great moneymaking idea - back in the 1970s! But now, even he admits that if you try to do this you're going to find that there are hundreds of people, with the same idea, trying to buy the same property! So, why did he just explain a moneymaking scheme where the odds are overwhelming against you?<br />Another method he mentions is how he made money buying stock before it's offered for sale to the public. Kiyosaki forgets to tell you that this is called an Initial Public Offering (IPO), and it's damned difficult to get one - unless you either have connections or are extremely lucky.<br />Out of the 204 pages of this book, the actual practical advice can be summed up on maybe two pages. Here's the best advice from this book:<br />1. Buy ASSETS instead of LIABILITIES. This is the secret to making money without working. But Kiyosaki forgets to mention the famous axiom that goes along with buying assets: &quot;You need to have money, to make money&quot;<br />2. Buying a house is often a lousy investment. Banks make you believe that you're getting a terrific tax deduction by paying interest. The only problem is that for every $100 you get back in taxes, about $350 is wasted money, totally flushed down the toilet.<br />3. Understand Sales and Marketing, and be good at it.<br />4. Understand tax law.<br />I see a lot of well written reviews on this book. Professionally written reviews. I suspect that these reviewers have all learned from Kiyosaki's sense of style.<br />&quot;Most people work for their money. Rich people have their money work for them&quot; Gee, you know how much work it takes to write a 204-page book? And, at my count, he's written about 15 books.<br />You know, just because a book calls itself different, doesn't mean it is. If Kiyosaki's rich Dad really does exist, I suspect that he made his money writing books.
B007IXWKUK|5|Very intriguing and well written!

B0083ZRAJS|5|This book is truly a classic and deserves every letter of that title. If you have  seen the original movie this one is different I  many places but, you must remember that the book came first and not the movie. I would recommend this to anyone that loves classic stories or the Oz universe.
1565112318|4|This isn't the first Neil Gaiman I've read, having also listened to the author himself read an unabridged version of 'Coraline,' and having read in print 'Good Omens.' I like his urban fantasy (dark usually) style quite a bit. <BR> <BR>This story follows Richard, a fella who lives a rather normal life in a rather normal part of London, and who, out with a girl you'd rather he not live a normal life with, bumps into a small young woman who basically falls at his feet, beaten and bloody. Richard, being the nice guy, picks her up and helps her recover.<BR> <BR>You know that adage about no good deed going unpunished? Woah.<BR> <BR>Richard ends up running from two demonic sorts, after the girl, into 'London Below,' with the added bonus of that place sucking his above-London life into some sort of void, where no one can remember him. Before he's done, he'll suffer, try to find the girl, suffer, try to rescue the girl, suffer, meet an angel, and suffer. And there's some suffering, too.<BR> <BR>As always, Neil Gaiman's villains, and his heroes, have a fantastic depth to them, and the other characters are shifty and confusing enough that you can't quite figure out anyone's motives. It's a great story to listen to - and even though it was abridged, the sound effects and reading voice really added a great deal of tone to the story. I'm a little bit tempted to go find this unabriged and/or in print.  The world itself is easy to slip into, deep and dark and just wonderfully full of shadowy danger.  <BR> <BR>I think I need to find more Gaiman, regardless.<BR> <BR>'Nathan
1878424505|5|This book was recommended by my therapist and exactly what I needed. It speaks to the situation that brought me to it plus others from my past. I wish I would have read this years ago, but then again, I may not have been ready for it. It's an easy read but definitely stretches the mind at the same time.
B00H48ES7C|5|This game rivals PC games. It is hard to find android games with as much details and levels as this game. I believe android users would be willing to pay more for a game if it functioned as its rival PC game.

B00GT67UUM|5|I originally bought this app from Google Play for my 10&quot; ASUS TF300T and I am very happy to see it for my Kindle Fire HD.  I am not one of the more paranoid users who suspect all permissions.  True that there are some bad datamining apps out there, but I feel that this one mostly had some such as &quot;OS finished loading&quot; because Google apps have to cover a much wider hardware platform.<br /><br />Superior replay value on this and a good Award and achievement system, which games like &quot;Scissors and Buttons&quot; is very weak on, though Quell is still the best I've seen because of the ironic &quot;negative achievements&quot; like the &quot;Scenic Route&quot; for taking twice as many moves as needed to complete a level, or managing to get &quot;killed&quot; on the first move.  On this game you can get Gold Silver or Bronze awards in each of 3 Categories, - 1) Solve 2) Time and 3) Moves.  Each Gold is worth 3 stars, Silver 2 stars, Bronze 1 star.  If you get 3 gold for a puzzle level, you get a 10th star and a Master Mechanic rating for that puzzle.  The Main Menu displays a running total of stars and ratings so you can see at a glance which ones you wish to replay.  I also like that the puzzles are named instead of just numbered, like so many other apps. I also like the mechanical Steampunk gadget feeling.  I used to play Mousetrap (Rube Goldberg board game) and Contraption (PC game).  I like old clockwork toys, Jules Verne movies, Meljean Brooks books.  I like that early industrial age feeling.  I am now working through the puzzles again trying to get to 300 stars out of a possible 500.  I rate this one as well worth my $2.99 especially with coin discount. Five stars.
B008IJTFYW|4|Highly recommended.  This is a nice app to help you relax before going to sleep.... or just have as a background noise.

B0041OT9W6|5|I'm not even finished with it and I'm already in love with it.  Anne Frank is an amazing writer.  Although the story is about very dark times, Anne finds a way to bring humor to a tale of such an awful time period.  After I finish this one, I think I may even purchase the The Diary of Anne Frank: The Critical Edition.
B000E8N690|5|this is a fantastic movie and the actors are so good. they made the lives of Cash and Carter come to life.

B004MC8CA2|5|I love being able to compare so many other versions with just a tap of my finger. At first I didn't realize that I would have to download the versions I wanted in the event I was without wifi. I once spent over $200 for an audio Bible. Now I can listen, read, or search anytime and it's so simple. I've noticed that it works better on my Kindle than on my ipod touch, though. Thank you, thank you, thank you for an awesome app!
B009UX2YAC|5|this app is great it is a little hard to get more keys but I still love,but I wish that the new characters would stay.
B001NLKT60|4|I loved \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" and also loved the sequel, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire.\\" Admittedly, this book isn't QUITE as good as the first installment in Stieg Larsson's series, but it comes pretty close. While the story does drag a bit in places, I love that the entire story focuses on Lisbeth Salander, who finds herself in the middle of a triple homicide case and is on the run from authorities. Journalist Mikael Blomkvist is one of the few people who believe Salander is innocent, and he devotes himself to finding the real killers at large. This is a great mystery that's quite suspenseful, and I didn't want to put it down. I'm very eager to read \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" now!
B002NQ08JW|5|Joyful and inspiring

B000002L68|5|What startles me most about Mr. Nelson is his capacity for creativity.  And at the exact same time I'm in for the long ride.  Someone said to me that Prince is another Bob Dylan, not all of his music will be consistent hits but he is creating a canvas of creation, not only commercial success.  I remmeber seeing Purple Rain as a child and being fascinated with this odd man who was so completely himself or of his own creation.  I had a friend who couldn't tell from his first albums if he were a man or a woman at first---much like Tracy Chapman.<BR>I am not a Prince fan, he specifically said that fan is short for fanatic, he instead calls those of us who buy what he puts out \\"friends\\".<BR>I have at least 20-25 Prince CDs in my collection and still another dozen or so new tracks, foreign tracks to find on Ebay and so on.  He creates such a breadth of work that Amazon.com literally is not big enough to keep all of his work.<br />Purple Rain.<br />A meditation on God.  Its all about God.<br />Warner Bros. wouldn't let him use the world Devil in Lets Go Crazy so he used \\"when the leevator brings you down\\"----I survived because of that song, the whole WTC thing.  That song kept me going.<br />I Would Die 4 U----he's talking about Jesus, folks.  he whole repitition of I would die 4 u, the simplicity and the power of it just cuts to the heart of God, sex, drama.  And no you can't have a little Prince without the element of sex.  I think his work gets lost to the projection of it.  Ok, his Moon is in Scorpio and yes, he has said some of the wildest lines I have ever heard in music.  But he's also SAYING something.<BR>There are a couple of books on him, mainly homages from what the reviews and quick glances say.  I have often wondered what I would create if I stayed up 24 hours with Prince playing on repeat and random and I just typed away for hours.  Janet Jackson's music got me to create a book and a dozen short stories that got published.<br />Is Purple Rain my fave Prince CD.<br />They are all my fave.<BR>The up years when everyone was all over him and even now when he's a corporate pariah and literally owns himself.  I hang in there, I buy each Cd faithfully as if I'll hear him every night I go to a club.  Because the really good DJ's throw him in.<br />He plays 28 instruments---by ear, no lessons, just by musical affinity/genius.  Can you imagine that many sounds in your head wanting OUT?  <br />I would die 4 u, the best hymn/erotic song, definitely in my top ten.<BR>Let's Go Crazy, another classic with deep undertones if you listen to the words.<BR>He writes stories, fables, vignettes.  Not just a beat and a hook line.  I rarely listen to \\"new\\" music, disappointed by the lack of inspiration.  Beautiful Ones?  Wow.  My lilieu is writing, it always will be and even if I work hard at a dozen other creative forms I suppose it will always be my strongest with reading its active companion.<BR>Prince is to me in music as Toni Morrison is to me in writing.  In fact they were the first subjects I ever wrote about to be published.  They are the few must haves on my shopping list and teh perennial faves to repeat (including Janet).  His later collaborations with Patti LaBelle I think produced some of her strongest work next to LaBelle and the other hits she had.  Marvin Gaye, Miles Davis, Bob Dylan, Carole King, Billie Holiday, Biggie Smalls, Ice-T, there are a few really, really huge folks who embody art and power in their work.  Its almost a shame that one has to have all of this commercial drama around it to be a success.  Prince is right, music should be free.  I wonder what it would do if we paid on donation for music to the music industry, how tough or easy it would be to get to superstar status.  Say you got the CD for free and then you could drop them some money on PayPal if you liked it?<BR>That would change EVERYTHING!  Why do you think Warner bros. worked so hard to keep Prince's masters and to dissuade other companies to work withhim?  When you wonder why some really great folks best days are behind them, its the whole business end, it suffocates creativity.<BR>Luckily, Prince Rogers Nelson knows of the Curtis Mayfields, the James Browns, the Harold Melvilles that created when there wasn't a billion dollars at the end of the road.  I think Im gonna get some good drinks, finger food, 24 hours and put all my Prince in and see what his music brings out of me in wordsssssssssss.  Omni

B00IIZ2732|4|I grew up with Jethro Tull and have always found the albums to require multiple listenings in order to truly appreciate them to the point where they resonate deep within your mind.  This new solo effort by Ian Anderson is very much in that vein; I have listened to it enough that I can now hear the diverse songs in my mind and have enjoyed them more than some of his prior efforts (e.g. TAAB2 & \\"Secret Life of Birds\\").  The compositions are fairly complex, but brilliantly executed, as usual.  Its not quite Jethro Tull, but the general style still permeates the disc (very much like TAAB2 or \\"Rupee's Dance\\"), even though IA's voice has never been quite the same since the 1980's.  One thing you might miss: there isn't much of the great acoustic guitar that all Tull/IA fans know and love.  Not sure why IA doesn't toy around with those wonderful acoustic ditties anymore... Otherwise, a great set of songs and well worth a listen or two or three or...

B00GY0HJ4K|5|Very good and interesting game. Makes me want to go on and on to see how many times it takes me to beat it At its own level. Can't  get. Enough of it!
B001UV4XJ2|1|I bought PART 2 today on release day. COULD NOT BELIEVE IT!!!!!! it is the same movie as part 1 only 16 minutes removed front the first of part 1 and nothing new. Part 2 means part 2 not a copy of part 1. I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED YOU STOLE MY MONEY NOW I HAVE 2 COPIES OF THE DEATHLY HALLOWS ! How can you legally do that?  Why would anyone be stupid enough to buy the same movie twice? You lied when you put part 2 on it. Real rip off do not buy if you have part 1 then you already have part 2  BEWARE potential customers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. SOMEONE SHOULD SUE THE MOVIE COMPANY!
B00DB624GS|5|I don't know why it took so long to restore a proper version of this album to CD. I don't feel the need to review the album, but the one flaw (which apparently will never be fixed) is the lack of a stereo version of &#34;Oh Well&#34;.  It always appears as the 2-part single version, in which about a minute and a half of music repeats from the end of part one on the beginning of part two.  Somewhere you would think a stereo mix of the complete un-edited track could be produced. Otherwise you can digitally edit the song into one long 7 1/2 minute track.
1594202273|5|I was a bit daunted by the 600 pages. However, I could not put this book down!  One of my best reads ever.  If you have any interest in military history, science, politics, then this book is for you. Fascinating!

B005LAIIGW|3|First off, I could not understand how the whole premise of this film could have occurred in the first place. Did the Russians shoot down their own satellite which caused the space debris? Surely the international community would not have allowed such an event to transpire if such consequences were possible?<br /><br />I hated Sandra bullocks character. There were a few scenes that dragged on far too long and some which were completely out of sync with the serious tone of the film. One was a scene of her continuing to talk even though her oxygen was at 2%. Another was a scene of her talking to a chinese guy on earth repeating woof woof sounds. I couldn't wait for that scene to end.<br /><br />I didn't understand why clooney's character chose to cut himself loose in the scene where bullock was barely holding onto him. Maybe someone can explain this.<br /><br />Clooney's character brought a lot of charisma and humour to the film but had the negative effect of highlighting Bullock's awkward and hysterical nature. In a disaster/survival movie I want to watch smart, calm and resourceful characters not incompetent, edgy characters with emotional issues.
B00G5G7EXY|5|Great!
B009POCG2C|5|Well worth the wait. I am a big Clint fan and almost every movie he does is to my liking.
B00004SCX6|1|This record does not display any talent from Britney Spears. Poor vocal talent and what she sings about brings this record to the ground. In &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again&quot; (the song), she says &quot;I'm not that innocent.&quot; What is she trying to teach her 10-18 year old fans? That it's ok to have sex and play with mens hearts? Another example is &quot;(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.&quot; Between words, she puts a &quot;uh.&quot; Another thing that bothers me is her live performance and the way she dresses, but I won't get into that. Like I said before, she has poor vocal talent. Can't hit any notes. She tries to hold those long notes, but it just sounds like she's yelling instead of using her voice like Christina Aguilara does. Her songs take forever to end. You listen to the chorus about 6 times at the end before she finally shuts up. None of her songs are produced greatly, and it sounds like she just went into the recording studio and quickly sang her parts and didn't care what it sounded like. Her only talent is dancing, but just being a good dancer will not get her any farther into her career, it'll just bring her lower until no one talks about her again.
B00000JLWW|1|Okay, it wasn't that bad.  I would have given it maybe 3 stars based on it being a sappy story with impressive effects and excellent costumes and set design.<br />HOWEVER - this movie has the most atrocious, mindless, badly written dialogue of all time.  It was NOT in any way true to the period which was not only incredibly distracting but it would have been SO easy to fix.  It was badly paced, badly acted and grated on my nerves to the point where at the end, when Leonardo does the cannonball to the bottom of the Atlantic, I had to laugh out loud!  Just so I wouldn't have to hear him talk again!<br />If you enjoy period pieces with elegant, refined or even remotely historically accurate language, this is not the movie for you.
B00LP9E79U|1|What a steaming pile of Poo.
B004RQDQIQ|5|this has been a favorite of my since i first saw it years ago. Byrne, Turturro and Finney are stellar. The story is focused and compelling, and the Cohen's early in their careers show incredible range.
B004XDYJRU|5|The number of radio stations available on this app are mind bogging!  The pro app, as of 2/26, is working and installing with no problem.  The differance in the pro is you can record shows, which I wanted to do, and works well. Save your money on all those other radio apps and try this one first!<br />Before I got this I paid for Hockey radio, a police scanner, and a NOAA radio app, and this one does it all. Save your money, I should have just got this one. I can tune in my county police scanner,tune in any NHL hockey game, and listen to my local weather on the NOAA channel that is near me, all on this app. Additionally I searched Dragnet and found every episode in addition to radio detectives and found any old radio radio show I wanted too. This to me, as a radio enthusist, is the best app available for the kindle fire. Would give it 10 stars if I could.
B009UX2YAC|5|I love this game and I'm hooked!!!  It gets faster and fast so you are challenged to play it through the mazes.  LOVE IT!!!
B004SOR4H6|5|Love this app and it's so much easier to navigate in the tablet version! Would highly recommend downloading this if you're a fan of tweeting!
0345803485|5|This book was beyond awesome.  Christian and Ana were terrific together in their relationship.  You don't know whether to love Christian or despise him.  Ana was so loving to him despite all his conflicts and adolescent behavior.  I also loved the 2 following books as well. I give it 5 stars.
B007TK77QE|5|JK has made the transition from &#34;children's writer&#34; to adult fiction with great ease.<br /><br />Absolutely fabulous storyline with real characters that one could relate to very well.  Could not put it down.<br /><br />Can't wait until her next one.
0061537934|5|I am a dog lover so I fell in love with Enzo, the dog narrating the story, from the very beginning. Although this was a fictional work, the  \\"Enzo-isms\\" were inspirational and made the character even more endearing. As you are drawn into the life of an extremely likeable guy, Denny and his charming and very intelligent dog Enzo you will be led down a road of seemingly insurmountable challenges that will leave you asking what could possibly happen next and how can one person endure so much? It's almost impossible to read on but even more impossible not to. Despite all of the disappointments faced by Denny and Enzo, there is a heart-warming ending that is guaranteed to make you smile if not cry. I have a new favorite book that I honestly did not want to finish reading because I wanted MORE ENZO!!! This book will make you laugh, cry and especially wonder the next time you look at a dog, just what they are really thinking. Thank you Garth Stein for writing such a wonderfully charming and insightful book.
B00HXYKYIE|5|What a beautiful story, you always write wonderful books, but this was amazing. Thank you so much for the time you take to make them perfect.

B000XUBFE2|5|This is hands down one of the BEST books I have ever read!  I felt so connected to the characters that I actually cared what was going to happen to each one of them.  I found myself thinking about the book throughout the day each time I put it down.
B00GY0HJ4K|2|Only getting 5 lives unless you wait or pay not really worth it .  I had to get a message that my lives were replenished before I thought to play again.

B000SCHBGQ|3|If you ever read Harry Potter, you will remember the name Nicholas Flemel who apparently was a real person in the world's history.<br /><br />Here, Nicholas Flemel is the alchemyst, and him and his wife have roamed the earth, protecting a book (lamely named the codex) for about 500 years.<br /><br />Throw in the mix a huge slew of mythical caharacters from goobal mythology in some good vs evil tacky story line.<br /><br />Still sounds salvageable , right?<br /><br />Now throw in a pair of fraternal twins, who apparently have 'rare auras' and get crazy supernatural powers and will 'save the world' (and you have to read about the angst of one of them losing their ipod, no joke).<br /><br />gaaaag<br /><br />Now, when I hit the last page, I was like 'DARN' but it wasn't worth it enough to pay the $ to download the next in the series on my kindle. The good news is, this book is free to download for your kindle. For FREE, it's worth reading. If you get it from the library, and don't pay for overdue fees, it's worth reading.<br /><br />Buying , though? Not for anyone over 18 years old. if  was 14 and read this, I'd think it was teh [sic] awesomest book since Harry Potter. But fortunately, I am not 14 any longer. The question is - are you?

B0027MJU00|5|This book kept me reading because I just had to know who the murderers were. The characters were so well written that I had disgust for some, and felt sorry for others. This book was so well written that I felt like I knew all the characters and the lifestyles. I was rooting for Libby through the whole book as everyone else had. I was happy for her that she found out what happened to her family with the help of someone she befriended.
B00QL0ST1K|5|Dialectic c.f. discuss
B000002H2H|5|First of all, how dare you compare the music of slayer with nu-metal ? Im sure that metallica's early sound influenced many deathmetal bands too, as well as, antrhax,megadeth,kreator,sodom's has influenced thousends of deathmetal bands, etc...So you realy need to get your facts straight buddy.Now its obvious that you know zero about thrash and deathmetal, to actullie think that slayer is deathmetal or nu-metal--that to me is laughable because when slayer was formed? Deathmetal  was far from begining let along nu-metal and  any  deathmetal vocalist are all well known for grunting over the microphone  and slayer's vocalist, you can actullie understand and he does not grunt, so therefore? Slayer is NOT deathmetal! Its an insult to any real thrashmetal person to have slayer's music compare deathmetal and whats worse? You compare slayer's sound with nu-metal... Whats wrong with you ?Its funny how you call them 15 year olds and yet your the one who has no clue about metal, at all.Anyways, metallica's \\"ride the lightining\\" is without a doubt even better then\\"kill 'em all\\" and its sure a masterpiece.
0743243153|5|I read this book about 12 years ago and it is still one of my favorites. I keep going back to it whenever I feel frustrated, lost, afraid, or depressed and it almost always puts me back in perspective again. Although there are truckloads of self-help books in the market today, this is one of the most well written, inspiring, and insightful. There are a few books that have significantly changed my life for the better and I can honestly say that this is one of them. Another book I recently discovered is &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. This book has taken me to the next step in my understanding of life, love and spirituality and I would also recommend this one for those who are ready. Both of these books are truly exceptional! Thanks to wonderful writers like this, people like myself have a guiding light to walk the path.
B0030IIYWA|5|No issues with this product.  If only my son would leave the DVD in the player.  I've found it in places I wouldn't expect!
B008JFUN6E|5|Not exactly what I thought at first but a very relevant story once watching it for the third time. We are headed this way.
B000002UAR|5|Revolver was released after Rubber Soul. This album continues the evolution of writting and composing of the fab four. It sounds very similar to Rubber Soul and is another great album.     Overall it's a lot more \\"60s\\" in the sound. A lot more of Georges Indian influence in the music. A lot more randomness in the writting of Lennon/McCartney. A lot more great drumming by Ringo (He's great on Tomorrow Never Knows).     Taxman is a classic song by George. It's sounds very similar to Drive My Car and just has a nice groove to it.     Paul says he made up a lot of \\"characters\\" in his songs like Eleanor Rigby. The String section was first used in Yestarday and is a perfect opening to Eleanor.     Other notable tracks are Goodday Sunshine, She Said She Said, and Tomorrow Never Knows. This is a great track written by John. He didn't want to come off the wrong way in his presentation so he used a saying Ringo came up with in \\"Tomorrow Never Knows.\\" This was a huge step in moving forward in the music. It showed the audience a sneek peak as to what future music would sound like and I think it's a perfect song to end with to transition into the Genius of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
B00MIA0L9U|5|Got this for my daughter...she loves it.
B002NPUCP8|4|I bought this originally for my 11 year old daughter who is starting to play guitar.  Having been a armature guitarist who was in a couple bands during my younger years, I really appreciate good guitarist.  As I listened to this, beyond some of the bubble gum lyrics, I spotted many influence of great guitarist in her style. Steve Via , of course, he even does a duet with her, but also Steve Morse, Eric Johnson and even I thought I caught a few Larry Carlton licks in there as well.  I think its great to see a well rounded master female guitar player. There have been a few, but not many , and less even lately. Well, less real musicians who play instruments and play them well with the advent of electronic  techno, samples and guitar hero.  Glad to see her and hope she does well. And I have to thank her for inspiring my daughters guitar ambitions as well.
B004VMUS9G|5|Its accurate.
0596007124|5|So much good, so easy to read, so comprehensive... if you're interested in design patterns, go and buy it. now. why is that you're not reading it already? <br /> <br />Now, in fact, it's one of the best-ever bought books I have ever bought. It has a place next to Code Complete.
B009UX2YAC|5|This is a very fun game and I'm addicted to playing it! I can never put my kindle fire down and do something else. The only problem is that there are TOO MANY ADS!!! Ads keep popping up and I end up tapping on them! It is really annoying...

B005D9MUWY|5|I am using this as my go-to keyboard on my rooted Droid Incredible 2 and just love it. It has two modes, and I use the &quot;precise&quot; mode, which makes suggestions based not only on the characters typed, but the context in which I've typed them.  Drawing from my SMS logs and address book,  some of the suggestions are uncanny - type in two letters of a 10 character word,  even misspelled, and get the right word in the blue box. Amazing technology.

1401207138|3|\\"Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?\\" This famous Latin phrase from Roman poet Juvenal is often translated as \\"Who will watch the Watchmen\\". Well after reading this highly regarded graphic novel; NOT ME! At least, not with any great enthusiasm.<br /><br />Absolute Watchmen is the full 12 issue limited series released by DC Comics in 1986 and 1987. It is beautifully printed on quality heavy paper with rich colour in folio sized pages. If you're already a fan of the series don't even read this review, (which you won't like), go out and buy the hardcover edition because it really is beautifully presented.<br /><br />Ok, now that the fanboyz are gone I guess I can continue.<br />** PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD **<br /><br />The Watchmen series is a standalone concept invented by Alan Moore with the intention of using up the characters from Charlton Comics that had been acquired by DC. Not a bad idea I would have thought, since those characters were never going to make DC any cash otherwise. The problem for DC however, was that Moore's plan for these characters would largely ruin them for any future crossovers into their customary Charlton Universe: some would be killed off and others would have their characters besmirched. \\"So  what!\\" I say, but DC thought differently and Moore and his artist Gibbons were thus forced to invent an alternate set of costumed heroes to embody Moore's grand plan.<br /><br />This is the first of the serious flaws in this critically acclaimed series: The entire concept was built around a pre-existing framework and then that framework was removed. When you remove the entire basis for a book you can't simply replace it with another and hope it will all go swimmingly! The thing to do would have been to start again, FROM SCRATCH, but clearly the vision was largely set in Moore's mind by this time and so new characters had to be shoe-horned into the mould left by the old. This is too much of a constraint on the freedom of each new character to live and develop in their own way and so the characters lack the spark they would otherwise have had. Also, CLASSIC comic book characters, such as Hulk, Wolverine and Batman, are not easily invented, they tend to come one at a time and the dross need to be flushed away periodically. This generally happens over years and is the work of many artists and writers. No matter the genius of a pair of creators, they cannot create an entire milieu such as the X-Men or the Avengers from scratch in the space of 6 months.<br /><br />The cast of Watchmen are mostly dull and uninspiring, so let's have a look at the main ones:<br /><br />Rorschach, real name Walter Joseph Kovacs, based on The Question: Attraction to comic characters is highly personal and subjective and I don't know about you, but a Rorschach blot for a face just doesn't do it for me. Neither do pin-striped pants and a trench coat for a costume! Fail! Other than the visuals, this character is one of the more compelling, representing an uncompromising, solitary, inhuman, vicious devotion to removing \\"bad guys\\". Sadly though, despite Moore and Gibbons' attempts to fill out his character, he remains wooden and 1 dimensional. Better to have just left him faceless.<br /><br />The Comedian, real name Edward Blake, based on The Peacemaker, Nick Fury and Wolverine: Yes, another hard drinking, cigar chomping, hairy, muscular, largely amoral, womanising ape. The ideal of the US marine: a social misfit and loose cannon that the US government can unleash on some other poor civilisation to wreak havoc. This manifestation of the inner ape goes through Mr Hyde and all the way to Priapus. He is an ancient archetype and works quite well. He can hardly be considered original though.<br /><br />Nite Owl 2, real name Daniel Dreiberg, based on The Blue Beetle, Batman and Clark Kent: This is the character that the reader is most intended to identify with. He is thoroughly good but contains just enough weaknesses to make him human. He is middle aged, overweight and has lost the will to fight. It is he that gets the girl and lives happily ever after. Visually this character is ridiculous: a cross between Batman and a Beetle. After the original Nite Owl explains why he didn't use a cape we find his successor wearing one. The cape has no useful function however and is purely there to make him look something like an owl. The night vision goggles, though functional, simply make him look like an insect and really, it is hard to imagine how Moore and Gibbons could have come up with a less visually inspiring central hero. Internally he is extremely bland and I certainly didn't identify with him.<br /><br />Ozymandius, real name Adrian Veidt, based on Thunderbolt: The perfect human: genius intellect in all spheres, world class athlete, martial arts expert, handsome, learned, self-made, enormously wealthy and powerful. The embodiment of the Aryan ideal and the new F&uuml;hrer. Interesting that Moore should choose to make the perfect human the villain of the piece, but take one look at Moore and you can instantly see that he's a cynical old bastard. It's an interesting idea and in better hands could have really been something, but Moore has no real idea how to turn this into a living character and he remains wooden and unconvincing throughout. Visually he is also somewhat ridiculous, clad in his golden costume. Obviously it's difficult, (perhaps impossible), for a writer to create a character who's intellect and education greatly exceeds his own, and we see that here.<br /><br />Silk Spectre 2, real name Laurie Juspeczyk, based on Nightshade: A spunky love interest as required! Not a lot of character there and not a lot of costume either, so if you like well drawn, well built, scantily clad young women, (and what male doesn't?), she's your babe.<br /><br />Doctor Manhattan, real name Jon Osterman, based on Captain Atom: The only character that I found compelling and the one that I most identified with, but perhaps that's just me. He is the only character with GENUINE super hero powers, in fact his powers are GOD-LIKE. To Moore's credit, his internals are also god-like and he is never shoe-horned into a human personality. I read comics to escape the mundane, and this blue skinned demigod is only one that truly escapes.<br /><br />There are various other minor characters who are run-of-the-mill crime comic fare.<br /><br />Before I go on to point out further short comings of this series, let me put in a good word for artist Dave Gibbons, and colourist John Higgins. The art work in this book is truly first rate and if you like American comic style then you will find no fault here. Not every one can draw the many faces and body positions of a range of characters so that they are ALL convincing, but Dave Gibbons certainly can. As for John Higgins: The full page, full colour pictures of Mars are truly awesome and really the colouring is superb right through the book. Full credit to the guys! If I were rating this work on art alone I would have easily have given it 5 stars. It is often the case that main reason you read a comic is to see the visual art and that remains the case here.<br /><br />The second main problem with this work is the way it DRAGS. For most of its almost 400 pages it is little more than a soap opera! If you like soap operas this is fine, but I want a compelling plot and a lot of action! Watchmen does NOT deliver those for most of its time. Quite frankly: I can't be bothered with lengthy and ham-fisted attempts to flesh out the internals of a costumed crime fighter! Just leave it out altogether or cut it back to a minimum, because the characters generally only become more unconvincing and wooden anyway. 80% soap is 80% time wasted! I don't really want to sit through EVERY character's back story. It would be ok if it were done a little at a time and it remained only 10% of the total comic, but surely this must be at least 50%! Too much Alan! Boring!<br /><br />The third problem is the pirate comic device. No doubt this is supposed to be an inspired piece of devastating irony designed to cast a dark shadow on the nature of man and the futility of trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist... But... IT DOESN'T WORK! \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\"... IT SIMPLY DOESN'T WORK! All it does is confuse the reader and make him long for those panels to come to an end. Why didn't the editor step in at this point and point out the obvious? Even worse is when they combine real world dialogue and Black Freighter graphics in the same panel. It might have seemed like a good idea over a bunch of beers at Gibbons' joint but folks: IT DOESN'T WORK! Capite?<br /><br />There are numerous other short-comings of the concept and the writing, such as: the 1 dimensional knot-head thugs, the stereotypical film noir newsstand, used as a mundane counterpoint, the highly dubious teleported squid thing that kills millions and prevents WW3, the cheap motivation of the mindless mob that pointlessly kill Night Owl 1, the absurd scenario of Silk Spectre 1 making love to the man who beat her and tried to rape her and then never seeing him again... I could go on and on, but these are relatively minor gripes, they merely indicate that Alan Moore is just another hack comic writer who churns out 1 dimensional, unbelievable and largely boring scenes and characters, relying on a couple of brilliant artists to make his tripe readable.<br /><br />Watchmen does take you on a journey, but it's hardly gripping and the climax is VERY weak. If you like action hero comic soap operas then this may well be for you, but it sure as hell ain't for me. I give this 3 stars, but only because of the excellent art work, and the fact that although Moore's concept and story is poor, it is no worse than drivel put out by most other comic writers.<br /><br />I think I'll follow the one interesting character: the naked, blue Doc Manhattan, and depart Alan Moore's Universe. Take me back to Dr Strange and the dread Dormammu!me. He is the only character with GENUINE super hero powers, in fact his powers are GOD-LIKE. To Moore's credit, his internals are also god-like and he is never shoe-horned into a human personality. I read comics to escape the mundane, and this blue skinned demigod is only one that truly escapes.<br /><br />There are various other minor characters who are run-of-the-mill crime comic fare.<br /><br />Before I go on to point out further short comings of this series, let me put in a good word for artist Dave Gibbons, and colourist John Higgins.

Too much Alan! Boring!<br /><br />The third problem is the pirate comic device. No doubt this is supposed to be an inspired piece of devastating irony designed to cast a dark shadow on the nature of man and the futility of trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist... But... IT DOESN'T WORK! \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\"... IT SIMPLY DOESN'T WORK! All it does is confuse the reader and make him long for those panels to come to an end. Why didn't the editor step in at this point and point out the obvious? Even worse is when they combine real world dialogue and Black Freighter graphics in the same panel. It might have seemed like a good idea over a bunch of beers at Gibbons' joint but folks: IT DOESN'T WORK! Capite?<br /><br />There are numerous other short-comings of the concept and the writing, such as: the 1 dimensional knot-head thugs, the stereotypical film noir newsstand, used as a mundane counterpoint, the highly dubious teleported squid thing that kills millions and prevents WW3, the cheap motivation of the mindless mob that pointlessly kill Night Owl 1, the absurd scenario of Silk Spectre 1 making love to the man who beat her and tried to rape her and then never seeing him again... I could go on and on, but these are relatively minor gripes, they merely indicate that Alan Moore is just another hack comic writer who churns out 1 dimensional, unbelievable and largely boring scenes and characters, relying on a couple of brilliant artists to make his tripe readable.<br /><br />Watchmen does take you on a journey, but it's hardly gripping and the climax is VERY weak. If you like action hero comic soap operas then this may well be for you, but it sure as hell ain't for me. I give this 3 stars, but only because of the excellent art work, and the fact that although Moore's concept and story is poor, it is no worse than drivel put out by most other comic writers.<br /><br />I think I'll follow the one interesting character: the naked, blue Doc Manhattan, and depart Alan Moore's Universe. Take me back to Dr Strange and the dread Dormammu!

B00VJ04TH0|5|I Know a Lot of people are on question on if it will be original or added with digital additions. Honestly I've seen both and have loved both, I can say I enjoy the originals much more BUT! This is the point can we first take a look at how amazing that Star Wars is actually being available for digital purchase? I honestly thought that It wasn't going to be out for at least 10 years maybe even more. I'm just happy that more people will be introduced into the universe.<br /><br />I'm very excited about the collection and I'll have a more comprehensive review when I'm finished with my thesis and done watch the movies.
6301661737|5|This was the first of Akira's movies that i have seen...iwas taken to see it by my mother who recognized my critical film watching nature as a youngster. I was thirteen when i saw this, and never stopped searching for  more of Kurosawa's movies, and have seen many (and include several as the  best movies of all time) but you know what they say about &quot;the first  time&quot;...i can't really say too much about the film that already has  been told, but i will say this...as a thirteen year old boy i felt kind of  funny weaping openly at the fact that i was witnessing sheer genious...not  at the scenes, the beauty of the film, or the plot (although when the  shadow warrior twirled his mustache, i did tear up along with the  servents!) but at the fact that film making could transcend the mediocre  nonsense that we hollywood mass consumers have come to accept as good or  even great cimema...i only felt that grateful for a film-makers  achievements for two other movies; the seven samuri and the recent  masterpeice &quot;life is beautiful&quot;....

The Hunger Games (Book 1) was the most fully immersed I'd gotten in a book ever in my life.<br /><br />This isn't just for kids and can be read at any age and enjoyed! I simply couldn't put this book down.

0374533555|5|Very Interesting and thoughtfully written.
B004J4WKUQ|2|This is equivalent of &#34;The Big Bang Theory&#34; in book form. The book is noted for its vast amounts of pop culture references, but they're so frequent that it comes off as shameless, gimmicky, and distracting from the plot. The dialogue is literally cringe-worthy in most parts and ALL the main characters are offensive to gamers and pop culture junkies alike. Also the plotting of the book feels like a junior-high student wrote it. Almost all perilous situations end in a Deus Ex Machina, and the morality and motives of the main characters are totally backwards. I would only recommend reading this book if you want to later make fun of it and tear it apart with your friends.
B007SYWFRM|5|My son loves the game.  He tells everyone to get it.  It is a lot of fun because you get to play with all of the characters from the movies.
B005LAIHQS|4|I got this for my brother and he likes it and says he watches when he has friends over and has loaned it out
B005V1WZ10|4|I'm going to try to be as objective as I possibly can in this review. But I have to tell you straight up, I knew absolutely nothing about this album before listening to it. I had no idea a new album was being released until I saw it sitting there on the shelf in the music store. So I heard nothing about any new sound. But what the heck! It's Korn. Korn's one of the few groups I'm prepared to buy an album on faith.  So I put the cd in the player in my car, expecting some great Korn nu mettle and instead got...I guess the term for it is \\"dubstep\\" though it reminds me a lot of industrial rock...I felt like I'd been rickrolled.  I'd imagine it was like buying a Kid Rock album expecting some heavy hip hop and instead getting country. It simply was not the genre I was expecting from one of my favorite groups.  However, the music is good. It's a genre that, if it had come from any other group, I would not have minded in the slightest.    But coming from Korn, I'm of two minds. It's good music in an industrial vein, so I can't objectively score it too low. But it seems Korn has abandoned its nu metal roots which has me sadly disappointed so that I emotionally can't score it too high.  So, imagining most people couldn't care less about my little soap box, let me sum up what this means to you.   If you want some good music and if you like this \\"dubstep\\" genre, this has some very good music. I'm sure even I will get used to it given a few listen throughs. It's a good cd with good music and objectively, I'm going to have to give it a decent score.  But if you're a long time fan of Korn, before buying this, you need to realize they've strayed very far from their nu mettle roots and you're going to need to keep an open mind to the fact that this is not the Korn you're used to. If you can't do that, you may want to stay away from this album.
B000068CNX|3|Judging by the reviews for this DVD, a lot of people have a lot of affection for the second season of Friends.  It's easy to see why - the smoldering romance between Ross and Rachel finally (!) materialises, Joey becomes a real star with a regular spot on \\"Days of Our Lives,\\" and Tom Sellick arrives as a semi-regular as Monica's boyfriend.  The last point is important - this season has the best guest star list of any season.  Especially notable, in addition to Sellick, are Julia Roberts as an old classmate of Chandler's and Brooke Shields as a fan stalking Joey.  The other highlight of this season is the appearance of the first flashback show (The One with the Prom Video), establishing the friendship between Rachel, Monica, and Ross in high school, when Monica was a LOT heavier than she is in the present.  Monica's \\"fat suit\\" is a great prop, and worth the price of admission by itself! <br /> <br />Unfortunately, much of the season is annoying.  It is manipulative, cloying, and artificial.  No sooner have Ross and Rachel got together then they are split up by an arbitrary and stupid plotline that stretches out over several more episodes.  This is quite aside from the fact that Ross callously tosses aside his very likeable girlfriend, which makes him mean and  unlikeable.  In fact, the whole soap-opera aspect of the first half of this season soured me on the show so much in its original run that I stopped watching it for the rest of season 2 and the entirety of season 3. <br /> <br />That was my loss, of course, because once the Ross-Rachel plotline resolved itself, the shows became as enjoyable and funny as those in Season 1.  So, it's worth the effort suffering through 5 or 6 painful episodes to get to the good stuff later in the season.  As for this DVD package, it's pretty thin when compared to such DVD's as The Simpsons.  There are a few extras - a couple commentaries, a couple other featurettes, but nothing spectacular.
B0052RE4MQ|4|Let me begin with what bothers me the most right now: I have NEVER had a book with such a TERRIBLE cliffhanger as this. This cliffhanger beats out The Son of Neptune by a MILE. You're reading it, all full of anticipation and excitement, thinking *SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT* What will happpen when she finds Xander?? OMG what will she say when she finds out his secret. You flip or press on to the next page, and BA BAM!! It's over!!! When that happened to me, I was just sitting there in shock, going,&#34;What? It's over??? WHAT??!!!??&#34; I kept trying to click on to the next page when there wasn't one. And I was left with more suspense than ever. FRUSTRATING!!!!<br />Other than that abrupt ending, all in all, the book was pretty good. A VERY VERY VERY miniscule step down from Matched, but I almost liked it better than the first book. It's filled with more action than ever.
B00CKOYVG8|5|this is a awesome and  fun game.
B00HXEWECI|5|On time and a as requested
B00IIUATDM|1|didnt even finish it. a movie abt a bunch of beavis and buttheads minus the rnr, but add nice suits, hookers and lots of drugs.

0064409422|5|I really enjoyed this book!  It has a nice easy to follow plot, yet it has a complex underlying theme, which makes it great for book reports!  It's about four kids who find action and adventure in an unlikely place, and discover a new world!  I reccomend this book to anyone who's tired of reading books that go all over the place, and are looking for a good can't-put-down book!
B00HWWUQWQ|5|great movie fast shipping
B005MSD6QU|5|The episode was great and I love criminal minds. It is always suspenseful. I highly recommend watching this amazing show!

B00T3DNKIE|3|This isn't the masterpiece &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird&#34; is but anyone who loves that book (and taught it for over 20 years, which I did) must read it for its insights into a writer's process. An NPR review said it reads like a sequel, not as an early draft; it leans heavily on your knowledge of characters and developments from the book we know and love. Some of Jean Louise's yelling scene with her father make you wince because they sound so adolescent in tone. She, too, is a bigot, not just the kind her Uncle Jack points out but the kind we recognize: she concedes points to Atticus that a truly color blind person would not. Scene with Calpurnia at her home is touching, realistic. Several times, Lee presents a party scene's dialogue in overlapping snippets (especially the Coffee Aunt Alexandra throws for her homecoming). Her technique with this type of dialogue is very clever and entertaining. Am grateful an editor helped her craft the better version with its exquisite prose and structure but am very disappointed that this book's honesty is absent from TKM. Interestingly, in the small reference to rape trial in this one, the defendant was ACQUITTED so in that one detail, at least, TKM presented the more dismal and realistic outcome.
B00FPH6AXE|3|Overall it was fairly predictable. It was an okay movie that I am glad I didn't go to the theater and pay full price.
B004Y042N8|1|The game just gives you a graph, and you need to find a Hamiltonian path.  It's really boring, and the interface just isn't great.  Avoid this game.
B00B2V66VS|3|A great game
B002LL13BQ|5|very satisfied
B005MLOKXA|5|Hooked after the first 3 episodes
B003UESJFG|5|Just watch it! You will enjoy the movie for every moment of it.<br />My son and all of us as a family have watched over and over.
B005EHQGTS|1|Sure the download is free but to use it you have to subscribe and pay money. Almost borders on false representation
B006MW3UZW|5|An English but good
B00HCOSEJ6|5|Pharrell obviously has a lot of talent and has the ability to make joyous music for all to enjoy...why he thinks it's ok to make this kind of song and then fill his album full of sexually charged lyrics young people shouldn't be exposed to is beyond me....be careful about which songs you purchase from his G I R L album...it has some great ones and the unnecessary filth...wish he could have made a whole album that was clean, up building fun...now that would make me HAPPY.
B00KFUU3GQ|5|Just got into True Blood a couple of weeks ago. So much better than Twilight...
B00BF123WG|5|Being honest, I thought that since it came out of Hollywood, it would be another mouthpiece for politicians in Washington (ALL of them, OK?). I am one of those weirdos who want what is best for our wonderful country, not what is best for some selfish, greedy politician. So, with that out of the way, this movie was spectacular, both in it's photographic perfection, and in the story it told.<br /><br />And what a story it was. Who knew that OBL was such a crying coward? Kathryn Bigalow did an amazing job of not only ferreting out the real story, but also showed real courage in not pandering to whatever politician brought this bad man to his necessary end. If you are on either the far left or right of the middle politically, you might not find this story satisfying simply because she did NOT give in and make it political.<br /><br />Perhaps, for me, the most astonishing part was finding out that a single woman in her stubborn search for the truth and in finding this vermin, finally made him pay for the thousands of innocent people he murdered. It was a very tense movie, reminiscent of Homeland in which I understand the beautiful character of Carrie in Homeland is based. Nobody in their right minds wants to see violence just for the sake of violence. But I have to say, watching this movie span 12+ years as our country underwent changes in Washington politics and the effect it had on the \\"war\\" on terrorism was almost as spell-binding as the search for OBL which is the main premise of this movie. Jessica Chastain as that woman put in an Oscar-worthy performance which unfortunately, didn't happen, brought her to life in a similar way that Clare Danes in Homeland does and got the Emmy for it!<br /><br />Well done, Ms. Bigelow. Far better than I expected it to be. Highly recommended for most people. A true lesson for the history books.
B00BIPCY14|4|I love this show.  I started watching it in Season 5 and got hooked.  If you tired of Vampire and Zombie shows, this is a nice change of pace.
B00HXYKYIE|1|I understand the plight of elephants but the drawn out back and forth of the characters with the research in between was awful. I just started skipping all the Alice sections. I won't give away the ending, but utterly stupid. Awful book, complete waste of 12.00.
B000002JSN|5|Led Zeplin is it. Zeplin is old school.  The best rock in my opinion.  My previous Physical Graffiti CD broke.  & I thought Amazon will get me a new one fast.    Thank you Amazon.
B00IEG0JOY|5|excellent
B00008977N|5|This is really an awesome concert. I downloaded a couple of songs from the usenet.. and was truly taken by the show. So I decided to by the DVD... and to my surprise.. the DTS sound makes it SOOOOOO much better. I would definitely recommend it to all PG fans.. btw, I am not a big PG fan.. but still love this DVD... cause it's a great concert.
B005Y1B3Q0|4|Great action movie.  I purchase The Expendables 2 and enjoyed it as well.  I will probably purchase the 3rd movie they are working on now.
B00028HBKM|5|Its been a few months since I went to see The Passion of the Christ twice in theatre. Both times I was moved to tears and both times I witnessed the brilliant direction of veteran director Mel Gibson. I wonder, where are the riots that Jewish leaders claimed would occur? Where was the rampant anti-semitic acts that were to happen because of the this simple little film? As far as the papers were concerned, the sky was supposed to fall after this movies release. Instead a wave of love spread through out our nation. People from all walks of life were brought together by this film to celebrate their faith and witness the raw and inspiriring portrayal of the life and death of Jesus Christ. Christians everywhere were supposed to suddenly hate the Jews after watching this movie, instead something else happened. Christians everywhere showed their intelligence and good will and understood that this film had NO such message. All of that talk and concern, over nothing, all it did was take away from the REAL story about this movie. The story of a God that loved man enough to sacrifice himself for us. Come Oscar time, we will see how Hollywood treats this masterpiece. Will politics get in the way of truly rewarding the best film of  2004? Only time will tell.
B0043URV8M|5|Very well represents the spirit of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1. I havent actually listened to the CD itself, because it comes with a free MP3 download (which i have on my phone). Just purchase this, and when you check out it says amazon has put an online copy in your Amazon MP3. Just download the free (Amazon MP3) app, sign in with your amazon account, open the album, and press the download button right of the album cover, and below the album name, and its downloaded right into your library! Super easy and convenient. When im in my room i just plug my phone into the auxiliary cable to my stereo and listen. Very relaxing. I highly recommend this to any HP enthusiast :D
B0054JZC6E|5|awesome game I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to pass some extra time. I hope that my review helps.
B005S9EJ14|5|Perfection on every level: writing, performance, directing, cinematography.  I'm looking forward to seeing it again and again.  The first time was in a theatre, so each additional private viewing brings that experience back again.  Then I can savor it.  You'll forget it's a movie and simply think you're secretly eavesdropping on other people's lives.  Well worth the money and the time.
B00F91SCXC|4|Good movie.  I was thoroughly entertained.  I can say that I enjoyed it and it's worth a look.  A bit better than expected.
B00KT3LC7I|5|Best album of the year hands down.  Yes its a depressing album but i just can't stop listening to it.  Sam Smith voice is undeniable, its so clean and clear. I keep &#34;Not In That Way&#34; on REPEAT.
B00AEFYCDW|5|Great film
B006ID6NDQ|5|Hard to stomach yet very interesting as to learning the good and evil in all people.<br />The author shares her story and her opinions fairly freely.
B0063IH60K|4|I like this game.  It was free and the ads aren't too intrusive.  I just can't figure out the scoring and how it's calculated.  It fluctuates a lot up and down and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to it.  Other than that, I do like playing solitaire a lot.  I used a different game previously but it kept freezing up my Kindle, so I had to uninstall it.  This one hasn't affected anything negatively and for that I'm thankful.
B00BWBHIUG|5|this game is so great for my little sis she loves it so much I let her play it for at least an hour
1476734941|5|I like this Diet it seems to work for me more then the other ones I tried over the years.
B007ZXK08C|5|This story took an unexpected turn every single time that I thought I finally knew where it was going. I simply couldn't put it away until I saw the ending. It was a bit of a disappointment because I wanted justice for Nick, but I guess that would have been a cliché ending.
630575067X|3|When i saw this movie at the theaters i was really impressed.I had never before in my life seen such good special effects in a movie before.But  there was one thing dough.I had of course seen the old star wars trilogy  before and i loved it.I loved it so much that i even used at least 50  dollars on the special edition versions.And when star wars episode 1 came  too the theathers i was amazed.Amazed of how George Lucas could make an all  time classic trilogy into a movie for childrens(12 years old).<br />And when  that happend all the star wars spirit ran away. <br />The three stars i gave  to this movie, i gave to the special effects and the few memerable scenes!
B0073V7YTY|2|I didnt know if there was a shut off, hence it drained the battery of my kindle,  not really sure it worked
B008WF9V7I|2|Historically interesting movie with a predictable plot and some primitive special effects.  Raquel Welch's first big movie role.  Mainly interesting to see the special effects of the day.
B00I2TV3NO|3|Good movie, but it left me feeling down. I remember when I read the books the story got darker and darker with each book, same thing with the movies. I thought the movie was very true to the book.
B005KR6OBM|5|The right price, quick delivery, and no hassles or issues what so ever.<br />Could not have asked for more, will be getting the rest of my collections from here
B000FC1HBY|5|It gets harder to read as it develops and the protagonists have the world against them and I'm yet books away from the climax.
B001GCUNYO|5|Great movie. Blu-Ray makes it better. Anyone who like Liam Neeson and edge-of-your-seat drama would like this movie very much.
6305428050|4|I LOVED this movie when I was younger, so I wanted to share it with my daughter... but evidently, I had the video-taped television version, cause there are lots of curse words and inappropriate things in this one!! I can't let her watch it!!!  Still a great movie, just not for little ones!
B0034G4P26|5|My 5 and 8 year-olds watched this with me and we found it funny and charming.  The stop animation is something they loved and are working on their own stop animation movies now.  We liked the message in the movie too about finding out what's most important.  The Pirate Captain's experiences were a little sad throughout the story and we found that more realistic and touching.
1423141997|5|Percy Jackson, the son of the Roman god Neptune, loses his memory. He then has to work together with people he has never met before to try to get his memory back. On his journey he encounters many antagonists that want to kill him. Will he find his memories? Will he live to find his friends he no longer knows? This is the plot for Rick Riordan’s addicting book, &#34;Son of Neptune.&#34;<br /> Rick Riordan is a great writer, when he writes mythological books, he is always mythologically correct. He always has unexpected twists and he adds a great amount of details to his books. In the &#34;Son of Neptune,&#34; Riordan makes most of his characters real Greek or Roman mythological people and creatures. Although he has a few made up characters in his books most of the antagonists are real. In most of his stories he has a few unexpected twists, but in the &#34;Son of Neptune&#34; he has added many unexpected twists throughout the beginning, middle, and end of the book. In the &#34;Son of Neptune&#34; Riordan creates his characters with so much description. His descriptions make me feel like I know the main characters. Not only is Rick Riordan good at describing characters, but he is very good at describing setting. Rick Riordan is a well known mythology writer and his passion and talent for writing Greek and Roman mythology really shows in his book, &#34;Son of Neptune.&#34;
B00BSBT8M6|2|Boring
B002JF1N0A|4|As a book, 5 stars, no doubt. It's one of the most important books ever written, forever changing the relationship of science and religion. Darwin's book is based on indirect evidence, but it has been validated independently by modern genetics and molecular biology. Seeing where he was right--and where he was wrong--is key to reading this book. It does help if you have a science background, since much of the language and subjects require some knowledge. However, seeing the inductive and deductive reasoning in this work and how thoroughly this has been thought out, and how SUBTLE it is, is wonderful. A long read but worth it.<br /><br />It is important to note that as a Kindle version, there are typos in this work. Not massive numbers, but enough to notice and get tiring as you read along. So minus one star.
1400069807|5|Cancer motivated me to change my diet, this book helped solidify those changes. It's disgusting how we are being played by the food giants. Read this and don't look back.

B006IGZWB2|5|I have been waiting to see this movie on Amazon and it is the best movie I have seen all year.  Great acting, great cast; an incredibly moving story. The title and the trailer tell what this movie is about so no need for me to write on that but, take the invitation to watch, you will be will be glad you did.  Have tissues :)
B000FC2L1E|5|Couldn't wait to start the next one. Downloaded it right away. Am really looking forward to the TV series!!! x
B00CWY76CC|4|This game is intense and mind puzzling...wish there were more games like this to play! Can't wait for more rooms!

0689504764|5|When reading this book to my kids they all loved it.  (Ages 3-7)  Just reading the title to them and showing them the front cover were enough to raise their curiosity of what the story would contain when it was being read.  They asked questions like: \\"Why are they hunting for a bear? Do you think they will be ok?\\"  We're Going on a Bear Hunt does a great job of making reading out loud to your kids a thing to look forward to.  Your kids will enjoy this little story as it takes you onward towards the bear.<br />When reading this picture book you will see that the Illustrations are colorful, lively and accurate in their support of the text at all times.  The clearly defined illustrations also complement the mood and setting of the adventuring family along the changing terrain.  You will notice the contrast between lighter and darker scenes as the storyline changes emotions and how they help develop the plot throughout.<br />Just like the illustrations, the text of the story is lively and fun to read.  The themes are repetitive and easy for young ones to anticipate.  (Another good thing for beginning readers)  The page has text that imitates the sounds that the family makes while on the bear hunt. You will also notice that the text and Illustrations are not mixed up with the layout on the pages, thus avoiding the confusion that some books do have.  The text is large enough to easily read and good for beginning readers.  My oldest enjoyed reading it to his younger siblings.<br />Overall, I would say that We're Going on a Bear Hunt is a great way to teach your kids, in a fun way, a little about what not to do when you go on an adventure in the wild;-)  It will provide plenty of good reading, laughter and silliness.  I am sure you will have your little ones asking you to repeatedly read this charming, fun and well-done book.
B003G4W49C|4|I read the intro as it comes up on the kindle version and didn't know it would be so long and self-aggrandising. However, I persevered and read the actual book, which is well-written and interesting in its premise. Much better than the film too. Recommended for kids and adults.
B0094KTBBG|5|funny
B0039UTDA6|3|Wow! People are WAY more negative about the Oprah version than I think is fair. Not even a dull narration can take away from the amazing footage in this series, and I don't feel it's a waste of my time to watch it on my DVR. It is still interesting, and I don't think Oprah takes away from the fascinating scenes that are unfolding on the screen. Personally, I think the footage is so amazing that nothing can really detract TOO much from it. However, having said that, she definitely comes across as being slightly bored with her subject matter, which makes it slightly boring for people to listen to, especially in contrast with Sigourney Weaver's version of Planet Earth, which I thought was quite excellent. I won't waste my money actually BUYING this version of the series.    If you want the BEST version of any of the Discovery Channel documentaries, David Attenborough's versions definitely enhance everything he narrates and is head and shoulders above anything else, especially in this case, since they also altered the narration for Oprah's sake. I agree with all the people who said they don't understand why they feel the need to recruit an American narrator for these shows, when David Attenborough is so thoroughly beloved by American audiences as well as British. In the case of Planet Earth, it worked and was pretty wonderful with either narrator. But in the case of Life, the narration is definitely not as smart and well-done as it could be, and I would highly recommend purchasing the Attenborough version over this one. I'm not an Oprah fan, but I believe in giving credit where it's due, and she does an adequate job here. The problem is that there is an EXCELLENT alternative for comparison, and this one doesn't hold up when stacked against it. Don't waste your money on this cheap knockoff version!
B005SFR7YE|5|You can tell Cameron Macintosh went all out when producing this performance. Everything is lush and the story just sucks you in!

0425170349|2|When I was a teenager, I burned through all of his early books in a few days, completely absorbed in the exciting military battles and intriguing political maneuvering. But it's clear that starting with this book, Clancy has run out of boogiemen. I'm an environmentalist, and although his topic of environmental terrorism didn't insult me, the bumbling, utopian narrative spewed by the disturbed tree-huggers did make me cringe. I remember turning each page, hoping, begging, to find something interesting to grab onto, but in the end it was a giant letdown. He started to lose it somewhere around Debt of Honor, but this is sure proof that he simply ran out of enemies. How much more Robby Jackson talking jive can you take? Or Ding spewing his East L.A. street-slang? The characters and plots are now cliches. Oh well-it was good while it lasted.
B004SJ3BCI|4|I got this game more for my niece and nephews when we travel together.  As I got further and further up the levels, I play it less and less.  Maybe I'm too old, but I'll let my younger kin-folk bother getting high scores and higher levels.
B004LROUNG|4|Hope he writes some more with the main character.  Good read.  Typical Grisham with good characters and plenty of action.
B0015DROBO|5|After having seen the movie several times, finally read the book.  Well worth it and look forward to reading others in the series.
B00EMXBDMA|5|Not only an excellent story, but a great example of emotional control despite the situation. Staying calm, assessing and building a plan to get out of it.
B004RJMUJO|1|The developers are complete scumbags, filling a paid app with ads and IAPs. I contacted them about this issue a while back and their answer was pretty much &#34;too bad, we already have your money so we'll do what we want&#34;.<br /><br />I will never buy or download anything from Halfbrick ever again.
B00005JLEU|4|When I see al the negative reviews, I wonder what is it that people dislike about it so much? They say &quot;confusing and bizarre plot.&quot; Well, you want a confusing plot, go see Memento!(meant positively)Huh, go figure.<br />Spirited Away is the latest installment by Hayao Miyazaki, master of anime. Seeing this really gave me the idea of what animation was supposed to be. Unlike recent failures, such as Treasure Planet and a lot of stuff by Disney, it had a spark that really pulled you in without anything but pure charm and intrigue. The lead, Chihiro, is somewhat whiny and a brat, but that all fits in. Characters fit in perfectly with their role, some selfish, some kind, and so on. <br />The actual animation was a show of talent by Studio Ghibli, as most of the movie, I sat thinking, &quot;Wow. This beats computer animation any day.&quot; The amazing artwork and beautiful animations all add to the unique flavor. Just amazing.<br />Now for the bad part. I originally saw Spirited Away in Japanese, so I could not rate the voice acting. (being not-Japanese) When I saw the American version with Daveigh Chase, I was appalled to see the voice and words butchered by Disney. (surprise, surprise) Very disappointing.<br />Overall, Spirited Away is a magical movie worth seeing... and seeing... and eventually buying. A true masterpiece... and who says all animation is just for little kids.
0596009208|2|I've heard great things about Head First books, but was turned off immediately. Who has time to wade through all this cutsie/hip presentation?  I returned gratefully to my all-too-grownup \\"Core Java\\" book and blasted through everything I needed to know, and more.
1612130283|5|Never had a book take hold of me like this one.  I am totally in love with Christian Grey, I can not wait till my order comes in for the Fifty Shades Darker.  I can't believe it could get better.  This book was Fabulous.
B005DOL0R0|5|Wow! Perfect fit, style, color and great price. My son love the color because its his favorite color. Now my daughter want me to order her one.
B002QE3CTY|5|A post-incinerated world sets the stage for scientific experimentation, survival and discovering who you are in dire situations.  The main character, Thomas, had my heart pounding and twisted in confusion until the last page when my curiosity and craving for adventure got me clawing for book two.
B006LSZECO|5|Well done. Crazy twists and turns. Abrupt and fast ending. It keeps you guessing throughout all of the events!  Two strong characters.
B00D23GXB2|5|Revenge of the Orgasm is a book of poems.<br />The words in this book  are very powerful<br />It was  like watching poetry live on stage
B0083Z6AH6|5|anything Jane Austin I adore, very easy to read, very happy with book, recommend purchasing book from amazon to anyone
B00DYTKKGI|2|If you are below the age of 8 then this game is for you. I am in medical school and I totally agree, you should definitely put band-aids all over yourself when you have huge gashes all over your body. This is wonderful medicine right here lol.
B008LCRAC0|5|What a scream.This show is really something else!
B005K17RU0|5|Nice new app. I liked the old one but change is good. This one has lots information. Thanks alot kelp up the good work.
B00IQO403K|2|Briefly, I found it depressing and unfulfilling.  Portions of it were quite novel and in the small there were some good ideas.  However, as a longer piece of work it went absolutely nowhere.
B005MYEQ4U|5|Being originally from Paris, I absolutely love this movie. A friend told me that it is second best, immediately after &#34;Match Point&#34; (which I didn't see but will).
B00EL8JCGU|4|Good movie. Not as much gore and blood as I expected.
B008Y6UNT0|5|Absolutely a movie worth seeing. It's not over done and there are no actual war scenes, for those who have a weak stomach for that sort of thing. I've watched it twice now and I personally enjoy it.
B00H71PHS0|5|Riveting !
B00U7VDC7A|5|Island Villagers but better.
0375842209|5|This has become my new favorite book. The narration was innovative and the characters were mesmerizing. I hated having to read the last page.
B004U8VUUC|4|Movie is morbid but great cast of actors and since it is based on true story it adds to the mystery.
B00DV2D0JC|4|It was a pretty good game.  I wish the story was a bit longer.  The game feels a bit short.
B00A757EFW|4|Pac man lite is just like the arcade game! There is still inky blinky and sue and the others, but there is just a certain spark to the old arcade game that isn't on the tablet edition. This game is still fun, and I still like escaping the thingies that Chase Pac man, but I still think that the arcade game is more fun. What can you expect? The game is free. I guess paying a quarter makes better quality. I would buy this game, though.
B00R3DOCJM|4|that's it
B009AP2G26|5|Continue to love this series! Was a little concerned when Rachel went to NY that things would fall apart, but good transitions back and forth. The New York story line is as good as the Lima one. Love that Kate Hudson and Sarah Jessica Parker signed on, great additions.
B00004THAY|5|Originally on back order but delivered much sooner than anticipated.  Excellent CD!  Highly recommended
B00AIUUXHC|5|It's an amazing game and I'm already at a tiger shark about to get a great white. One word, ADDICTING!<br /> I would buy it if I were you.
B00DHSK3RM|4|Can't get on my kindle fire. would love it more on my kindle this is where I wanted it please get on the kindle fire.
B00JB3MVCW|2|But what I was expecting
B0090EKRKU|5|I watched this with my grandchildren.  They chose it from the Amazon Prime list.  I enjoyed it and all three (ages 8-11) stayed interested through the whole thing.  There was a moral to the story and it was well presented.  I love Dr. Seuss.
B005HEF8OC|5|very nice
B00ESY7QXI|4|I have to say this was very good because I enjoy watching Leonardo who has definitely grown as an actor and surprisingly, (because at one time early in his career, I didn't get him) has become pretty amazing - but I am a fan of the earlier version, 1974 with Robert Redford. That is probably because of my age and let's face it - Robert Redford - do I need to say more?
B000JML7EC|4|this book is very good. i would reccommend you to read it. it is a very good read.
B002VPE1WK|5|This is an amazing bag for the price. I am not one to spend $120 on a gear bag when there are other \\"no-name\\" brands out there for cheaper. I purchased this bag not having the highest of hopes, but it turned out to be an amazing little bag. It holds everything I could possibly need. My only \\"cons\\" (only because its a review, I have to find SOMETHING that can be improved) I wish that it had more small pockets, for small items. And i wish that the zippers had a ring to put a small lock on them. (This can be fixed by putting key chain rings on the zippers and putting small locks on the rings)<br /><br />This is an amazing little bag, Highly recommended.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Year three is heart wrenching but equally as good as seasons 1 and 2. I would suggest this to any serious Downton watcher!
0714843377|3|Good book, easy to read. I finished this book in less than 2 hours. The other reviewers are exactly right, this book is targeted to advertising workers.  Good, but not great.
B001EYGOEM|5|Great.
B00BN3EE1O|5|Great movie all the way up to the end. It was a very tasteful movie.  I would definitely recommend it.
B00BWBHIUG|5|I absolutely love this game but it's a little hard to earn pears and t o buy them there expensive but is a good app so get it!!
B00003CXI1|5|Great movie! Even some people who haven't read the books will like this. Should buy!
B00IIB1912|5|Great show, great action, and great graphics!  I can't wait for season four to come out! It's going to be awesome, as well!!
031606792X|5|Ok, so I looove the twilight series. I like the stile of writing, the story, characters and so on. I loved Stephanie Meyer until \\"The Host\\", one of the worst books I have ever read. So when the new Twilight book arrived and after the not so good reviews I was very hesitant to read it. Didn't want to ruin my good opinion of the series.  What a relief - this book is simply great. The pace is fast, the story amazing and the whole new direction is just perfect for the series. Great and very entertaining story. Thank you Stephanie Meyer:))
B000E5KOJS|4|This is a movie version of Cosi in which the performers lip synch to a pre-recorded sound track. I expected it to detract mightily from the quality of the production, but it doesn't for two reasons. First, the lip synching is just about flawless. I don't recall seeing lips moving without the words matching (although there's a slight change in the tone of the audio as the singing starts and the soundtrack switches to \\"pre-recorded\\" mode). Second, the director Jean-Pierre Ponnelle gathered a first-rate group of performers, led by the great Edita Gruberova as Fiordiligi. Gruberova's \\"Per pieta\\" is reason alone to see (and hear) this production.<br /><br />So, it's a trade-off. You lose the spontaneous and intimate feel of a live onstage performance, but you gain a sound track that is recording-studio quality.
B008JGSM6G|5|I absolutely LOVE this app. It's great for the mind. It gets you thinking a lot. I wish they add a update. I totally LOVE THIS app.
B009KS4XRO|4|I don't know I feel about it. But it has a lot going on and I like it. I will keep it!
B002MQYOFW|5|Couldn't stop reading it! One of the best book I have ever read. Love love loved it! A must for everyone to read!
B008673ZAQ|4|Was good but not ready all in one night good. Didn't realize there was going to be a 4th book. Don't like to read series until they are all out to read back to back.
B00G3L6KQI|5|The only thing wrong with this series is that it's over!  Close attention to historical detail, careful characterization, and a cleverly woven plot made these books delights to read.  MORE, please!
B00KZ6WRAA|4|Messenger is great for talk on the side with friends...very useful
B004QZ9PLU|5|Excellent love story.  Very frustrating, hopeful, and heartbreaking all at once. The characters were honest and believable.  Very good read.
B00K0OI42W|5|This is my absolute favorite book of all time.  I read it a couple of times every year, it never gets old.
B0066W1AZK|5|I'm new to Chess Free (on the Kindle) and this is the BEST game EVER!!! I'm completely addicted!!! *Don't knock it until you've tried it. You wont want to put it down:)
B00001QEE8|5|Get them before their gone.  Our kids watched the video so much that it wore out.  Great movie.  Glad it's on DVD!
B00L633PXO|5|Excellent effort.  Really seem to be gelling.
B005IQZB14|4|Wild (From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail) is a great read for wanna be adventurers.  Cheryl describes her reasons for taking this hike and her expectations.  Along the trail she learns both how little one needs for survival as well as how to live in the moment.  A quick read as Cheryl resolves to take this journey.  With the ability to laugh at herself, she tells how she prepares, survives and builds strength both physically and emotionally.
B001QE9WEO|5|I love this movie brings back allot of Good memories as a child
B00EQ0CKRQ|5|The best game to have fun with and sick freaking graphics

B00NO08SOI|5|Legen--wait for it... dary...
B000002504|4|After hearing and reading fantastic things about this band, I decided to give GG a try with this album. I don't know if I reccomend following my route. My immediate reaction to Octopus was a negative one. I felt like a thousand piece jigsaw puzzle fell off a high shelf and dumped on my head. There are half a billion complex intricacies here topped off with some  unique vocals which are not easily appreciated upon introduction.   <br /> <br />I almost packed the disk off to my girlfriend's Tull loving father out in Utah.  <br /> <br />I am so thankful that I did not follow through. To the uninitiated this music fights for your respect... when it finally \\"clicks\\" it is wonderful.  I kid you not I started humming some of these melodies in my sleep and at work. I had to scan thru my iPod to figure out what I was humming. <br /> <br />Honestly I do not play the heck out of Octopus, but I did purchase a handful of Gentle Giant's other albums which I liked right away.  To the new and curious such as myself, I don't advise starting out with Octopus. <br /> <br />I do think Gentle Giant is brilliant... I had no plan on becoming a fan... they won my respect fair and square.
B00SH00N3Y|2|Not as good as the trailers make it sound, kinda boring
B004UID2LC|3|It was was okay. Really did not like it much. Took it off my kindle and downloaded tubemate and found that to be a better youtube.
B002UZXJA6|5|Songs from the heart is a CD I will listen to over and over, it is exactly what I wanted.
B008JIFJ4W|4|Great song, dislike that Amazon makes you download it via their software.
B002S0OBN2|5|Love Never Dies is a great album. This sequel will be just as great as the original. Please don't give it any more bad reviews on the musical.
0452289963|5|Not what I would term 'an easy read', but a worthwhile one.  I had to go over chapters more than once to think and absorb the meaning at times.  The message of the book makes perfect sense to me and gives the reader a new way to look at life, even those hard to look at corners like death.   It is leaving the ego behind and really living and sharing and having compassion for others.  It talks of us being all connected and a part of the universe.  An excellent philosophy to adopt.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5|The Zealot is a very fascinating book with loads of history of the time period.  I recommend slow reading so as not to miss anything or rereading the book.  There are plenty of references in the book that can be investigated later for deeper insight.
B00PTB7B34|4|Haven't had any problems so far good game
B00TKLOII0|5|This movie has changed my life. Malcolm doesn't even like reviews, but he got the Pulitzer for writing this review.
B00BMVTS1S|4|Beginning was a little slow but the action really picked up and was the movie was very entertaining.  Nice job!
B006RA0E5I|4|Pretty good...while this is not the apple Magic Mouse but works well with my son's yoga.
0307730700|4|Fearless about SEAL Team SIX.  A deep story about Adam Brown, a Navy SEAL who fought in Afghanistan.  It is a story about the extremes in the military and how that tied into faith, family and love.  While in the military, not only was there a war against the enemy, there is a war against one's own habits and impulses.  In this story, we see one's drug addiction and perseverance to become a leader, the best of the best.  While combating personal impulses and the enemy, there is a decision that needed to be made, what is the right thing to do?  Is utilitarianism a good ideal to follow?  Should we think of the big picture and forget the ultimate sacrifices?<br /><br />Eric Blehm is a vivid writer about military stories from the recent Afghanistan war after 9/11.  In the beginning of the book, we already find out that the main character, Adam Brown dies.  So, we already know what happens. But the author is able to craft the story in fine words, such that the suspense remains!<br /><br />I received a review copy of this book from the publisher Waterbrook Multnomah.  Check it out!<br /><br />[[ASIN:0307730700 Fearless: The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown]]
B00H71PBQ8|5|Love Downton Abbey, can't wait for season 5, I'll be watching for it
B005T87QCI|5|this game is epic and fun.the one stars have no sense of fun.love this game so fun have problems sleeping cause its so fun
B00CWVG1Z8|5|My two teenage sons, as well as my husband and I loved this movie. The special effects were great, and the story line was very engaging which kept us interested the whole way through the film. We not only highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies in this genre, but we will be purchasing it so that we can watch it again and again. :)
B002P8F956|3|not easy to navigate.
B0059WTMLW|5|Big Sudoku fan. Great game!
0439023521|5|I read this book and thought \\"What is wrong with this author?  How could she write something so disturbing, so twisted, so sick?\\".  Then I thought \\"Why couldn't it have been me who wrote something this good\\".
B00FN811SY|5|I have somethings that I haven't figured out yet but I love it.
B009TGXLZM|5|I love this movie. It is sweet and gentle, but it shows the problems that women had, and how Miss Potter overcame them. This was an era when women were &#34;owned&#34; by their fathers and husbands. Beatrix was strong, and talented. I revisit this movie every six months or so.
B00AREIAI8|1|again not sure why could not find it once it was purchased on the tablet must not have been compatible
1451698852|3|This was rather disappointing for a couple of reasons. First, it had little to do with The Shining other than the lead character being from that book, now grown up. There's little else that ties it in to the true star of the original--the Overlook Hotel. Perhaps another story set in the Overlook would have been a more fitting sequel. The second reason I was disappointed was the story itself. It's standard King fare, with the flawed hero (alcoholic, again--King has gone to that bottle one too many times); the baddies, who really aren't that scary; and an attempt at tension that lacks any tenseness. Without giving away the ending, let me know say that the story meanders to an ending that seems uninspired. I'm probably juding it harsher than usual because I loved The Shining as well as all of King's earlier works. I was so excited to finally read this book, and within about 100 pages, so disappointed. Not terrible, but certainly not in the same class as The Shining.
B001JQVKBW|4|When I first heard that Seal was doing an album of soul standards, I was a bit leary because many artists have tried to accomplish this feat without adding anything 'New' or they ried too hard to give their interpretation to songs that simply do not need to be touched. I was glad as a matter of fact elated to see that this great artist has proved me wrong. At this time in his career, Seal could have made no greater move than to record this album of Standards. There have been many albums recorded of standards but rarely have they been SOUL standards and even fewer have accomplished the level that Seal has raised the bar to. From the strings that are first heard to the soulfullness and melodic harmony of \\"It's A Man's World\\" to the illustrious instrumentation of \\"If You Don't Know Me By Now\\". This album simply accomplishes what it set out to do. It wins on every level. If you are a lover of true soul music and you do not have this CD in your collectiion, you are doing yourself a great injustice!
B003UBTX6S|4|I thought I would know the ending but it was a told shock. I did not know if I was going to read the third book but with that ending I have too...
B00A8ECU24|2|Game is fun but twice it has stopped and deleted progress.  No point in continuing to play if you are going to have to keep starting over :(
0393307050|3|This is a serious case of not the right reader for the book. The writing is wonderful and undoubtedly a ton of research must have gone into it. And if you're a person who is interested in naval fiction, especially naval fiction of the time, I imagine you will LOVE this book. I am not such a read and as such, I was bored.<br /><br />The first half of the book is VERY HEAVY in naval/ship/sailing terminology (plus the cant of the time) and I literally read it with a dictionary on hand. This severely compromised my enjoyment of it. And I'll acknowledge that, as there are 20 books in the series, 200 pages to set up the tone and terminology of the series isn't unbearable. But as half of a single book, it's interminable. I likened it to the ~100 pages of whale anatomy in Moby Dick, something you just have to get through to get on with the story.<br /><br />The second half of the book is far more readable, but it still fell flat for me. I think the problem was that I expected a sprawling sea adventure and instead the story is a series of small everyday adventures of a particular ship and crew. Meaning that there is no single challenge to overcome or adversary to engage or peak in the plot. It's just one random naval encounter after another. It really wasn't enough to truly grab me, even if I did like the characters.<br /><br />I didn't dislike the book and I'd probably read another, but it's one of those books I'm glad to have read but also glad to no longer be reading.
B00E8AVNBI|4|cool movie
B004P4S4NM|5|Great to sing with<br />thought provoking work<br />love the voice and the creative style<br />She sings to inspire you to listen
B005544TRQ|5|Great Show!
B001AQIYJC|5|Under rated movie, a classic, and the chemistry between Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage is AMAZING!  And they made LA look beautiful!
B0027HOBM2|4|Mad Men settles into its groove in season two, and it's a slow, languid movement that viewers will either savour or find to be too slowpaced. The acting and writing remain solid and the reveals about Don's past and others' problems come at a snail's pace. Although the show is set in the early 60s, the characters seems largely insulated as to what's going on around them. The death of Marilyn Monroe gets more play than crises with the Russians. It's all in the name on measured character development. If that's the type of television you find rewarding, there's nothing better.
B009KS4XRO|2|I think that the fact that we have to wait to collect all of our gifts is really wrong! These are our gifts and the game holds them from us,which, in doing so makes it so we can't play sometimes. Before they started this I really enjoyed the game now not so much!
B00N1JQ2UO|5|Really enjoyable, not citizen Kane but I'll probably watch it more times.
B000HT3PPG|5|One of the classics of Christmas, it's a yearly favorite for many, including me.  I don't know when I first saw it, nor how many times I've seen it, but I still enjoy it.  There are so many details in it that I find myself anticipating the next one as the movie plays out.<br /><br />  This 2-disk version offers a lot more than just the movie:  it includes both black & white and colorized versions of the original (1947) film, plus a TV version from the 1950s.  Also, Maureen O'Hara, who played Mrs. Walker, provides (optional) commentary of how the movie was made.<br /><br />  The story is so good that it's been done a number of times, the latest being a very nice 1994 version that changes things for a younger generation (e.g., the little Dutch girl made an orphan in Rotterdam in World War II is replaced by a girl who is deaf).  It's the sign of a good story when it can take so many versions, including changes, and still manage to entertain.
0783231202|5|This is the best movie that has been made in many years. Every scene, every image was done so perfectly that it is mesmerizing. I just love the part where that guy has the bible and he looks up at the ship and the masts  look like crosses and its just like they are being crucified for their  cause. The extreme talent that went into this movie is amazing.
B00785P2QC|4|Awesome game reminds me of sim city from back in the day i dont like the facebook update posting sux
B00C7TAF3Y|5|This was one of the best \\"escape\\" type games I've played.  A lot of thinking and visualizing .  I would recommend this to any puzzle enthusiast as well as escape game enthusiasts.  It is not the same old room puzzle door after door.  It has great visuals and a lot of different scenery!!  I hope I don't have to wait long for the next installment - what a wonderful piece of software!!
B0064MPXFA|5|Very engaging show with good depth of characters.  Great for men and women!
B00005MAM2|3|There are probably enough comments on here with 613 reviews at the time of writing that you already know this is a serious tale about the final evolution of man.  Though I will say you have to watch the movie a few times to catch the entire story and piece it all together. This movie is, after all, a digest of an extremely long manga run.  All in all they catch all the key points and bring it together pretty well.  (4 stars for the story and script). <br /> <br /> <br />The animation (especially for it's time) is superb.  Many modern anime series don't even hope to touch the visual quality and detail of Akira.  It's on par with Ghost in the Shell, or the recent re-release of Appleseed, with a little fudge factor for technology differences.  (5 stars). <br /> <br /> <br />Any anime nut worth his salt watches in the original Japanese.  Unfortunately my wife is not such a nut so I have to watch in English.  I don't recall who got the rights to make the original American/English release back in the late 80's.  Specifically the laser disk release.  Whoever it was called in a cast of serious voice actors and translators that did an astounding job in not only pure voice quality but also translating the story.  They didn't just do a literal translation.  They actually spent some time thinking about the story line and translated in order to provide an intelligent, adult, and coherent script.  As a result the English audio track on the early release was incredible! <br />  <br /> <br />Sadly with Pioneer taking the helm, the English audio track on this DVD edition is horrible!  The voice actors are very weak - to the point of being annoying, and much of the dialog is literally translated and comes across as childish.  It's like a bunch of 8th graders were turned loose on the script. <br /> <br /> <br />If you like to watch in Japanese the audio gets 5 stars.  If you like to watch in English I give it 1 star. <br /> <br /> <br />All in all you're no kind of anime fan if you don't at least see Akira, and most of you Japanese lovin' folks out there will love to own the DVD edtion.  Heck even the English isn't bad if you can tune it out.  I'm just spoiled by the old laser disc release.

1451626657|4|The title of Joseph Heller's Catch 22 (1961) it also the novels key concept, which Heller introduces on page 46 of chapter 5, Chief White Halfoat. Heller employs the story of Halfoat's people (p. 43-44) to frame this concept: \\"Every place we pitched our tent, they sank an oil well. Every time they sank a well, they hit oil. And every time they hit oil, they made us pack up our tent and go somewhere else. We were human divining rods.\\" The way out for Halfoat was to join the Army. \\"Only the army saved me. Luckily, the war broke out just in the nick of time. . . . I was the only survivor.\\" However, like Yossarian and the pilots in his squadron, Halfoat soon discovered that he had gone from the frying pan into the fire. Rather than continue to comply with the white man's demands, Halfoat \\"had made up his mind to die of pneumonia,\\" which he eventually did--inadvertently confirming the hopelessness and futility of escaping the finality of a catch-22 dilemma.<br /> Heller employs conflict theory to emphasize and critique the social, political, and material inequality of various social groups by drawing attention to historically dominant ideologies and power differentials based on nationality, ethnicity, class, and gender. What is  unique about Catch 22 is Heller's use of a bottom-up approach reminiscent of the work of James Scott in Weapons of the Weak: Everyday Forms of Peasant Resistance (1987), in which Scott demonstrates how ordinary, powerless people in repressive situations still manage to resist and even influence policies through actions such as sabotage, foot-dragging, and gossip. Yossarian's prolonged stays in the hospital to avoid combat; signing censored letters \\"Washington Irving,\\" or Irving Washington,\\" or \\"A.T. Tappman, Chaplin, U.S. Army (p. 8);\\" moving the Bologna bomb line (p. 119); or the exploits of other characters, such as ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen, who \\"distorted, destroyed, rejected or misdirected any correspondence by, for or about Colonel Cathcart that might do him credit (p. 215), are only a few of Heller's many fine examples.<br /> Heller's popular appeal is to a wider, somewhat disgruntled and disillusioned, postwar population all too familiar with top-down policies, elitist favoritism, and bureaucratic bungling. His novel also serves as a scathing tongue-in-cheek rebuke of democratic process and capitalist philosophies (Ch. 24) run amok, where average persons have little or no say in events that affect their lives. This is especially relevant for readers of the 1950s who, having survived WWII and Korea, find themselves living under an omnipresent cold war shadow of communist expansion and potential nuclear annihilation. Heller's message is clear: what's good for elites, politicians and business is not necessarily good for you.<br /> The strength of Heller's work comes from his status as an insider and WWII combat veteran. However, his position as an educated and privileged officer and pilot, combined with his overuse of ubiquitous humor, literary allusions, clever repartee, amusing retorts, sharp and witty aphoristic conversations, chauvinistic depictions of women, and his characters constant whining and complaining--disturbingly reminiscent of a Woody Allen movie--has an alienating affect that distances the reader from his message. As many have noted, it takes several readings of Heller's work to grasp the subtle nuances of his meaning--like trying to interpret the bible--which is by no means an endorsement of his work. Yet all things considered, Catch 22 is an innovative endeavor, well worth the effort, that has certainly withstood the test of time.
B00I6IKSZ0|5|I love this app. You can even make your own skins!!! It is a fantastic app!!!! I recommend this you
B00005JKDR|5|This DVD has to be one of the most incredible animated kids movies I have ever seen. The kids can watch it over and over without wearing it out, and I really enjoyed the bonus features on the second disc. There is so much on there that it takes quite a while to get through it, but definitely worth watching.<BR>For those who are worried about the 'scary' factor: It is not a scary movie at all. My twin 4-year-olds describe the monsters as being 'cute'.  What is funny about the movie is that the monsters are afraid of kids than the kids are of the monsters. The story has quickly become the household favorite, and I admit that I thoroughly enjoyed it as an adult! <BR>If you already have the VHS and are considering the DVD, I can tell you that it is a must-buy. You get all the bonus footage that is not on the tape, plus the colors/detail is amazing. It almost feels as if you are there on the set, even though it is animated. Sully is the most impressive of all with the realistic movement of each hair, but each character is unique and fun to watch. You can choose between widescreen and full screen, so you don't have to worry about buying the wrong DVD format.<BR>Overall, it was entertaining and a joy to watch. My entire family wholeheartedly recommends Monsters, Inc.

076790592X|5|Tuesdays with Morrie is more then just a man's last words.  It's an inspirational story about a man's views on life or a story of his own life.  It almost has two stories in it, a man fighting a very deadly disease or a professor of social psychology and how he breaks down the parts of a life.     This book happened by accident actually.  Mitch Albom (author) was watching TV and saw his old professor from college on ABC's nightline being interviewed about what its like to be dying from ALS, commonly known as Lou Gherig's disease.  Mitch soon got in touch with his old professor and it turned in to the biggest project of his life.     Morrie and Mitch started meeting every Tuesday and talked about different parts of life.  Examples would be family, marriage, regrets, and aging to name a few.  Each Tuesday has a different subject or topic.  The book also gives insights on the different stages of this deadly disease and explains with detail how it takes over your life.      Since reading this book, I have a different look at life.  I approach life with less fear and spend more time with the people I love most.  According to Morrie, life only comes around once.       I strongly suggest reading this thrilling book.  You will be taught some of life's greatest lessons and be able to view life in a totally different, stress free way.  The reason I liked it so much was because it opened my eyes to so many things I don't even think about.  Hopefully Morrie's class will be just as successful with you as it was for me.

B0019IB26I|5|For anyone who has not seen John Mayer perform, this is a must have; a full spectrum of what he is all about. From someone who has seen him, this takes me right back...I love the three sets of acoustic, trio and band.  This double disc collection showcases his beautiful acoustic work, the raw beauty of his blues work with John Mayer Trio, and concludes with an assortment of pieces of his best work from Continuum and Room for Squares.  I have heard him called \\"an old soul.\\" In this CD, he plays homage to those who have come before, yet adds his own voice. I have listened to this again and again and hear something new each time. It has a depth that draws you back. Mayer is one of the most talented guitarists, and songwriters of our time.

The only reason I won't give it 5 stars in the in app purchase. I hate the fact they have a cart for $49.95! I can't even imagine a small kid getting in to this and purchasing it!

B003ZSJ212|5|Either you want this or you don't. Either you enjoy the Star Wars films or you don't. I don't want to hear any of this nonsense about the \\"originals\\" or the special editions. WHATEVER! It's Georges baby and you are either on board, Jar Jar and all, or you are not. Honestly any reviewing sword casting aspersions on the new editions are semantics at best. If this came out when you were 7 you'd have imploded from excitement. Even negatives like Han fired first has become an entire joke industry in and of itself and who knows, maybe George intended it and he is light years ahead of all of us. Either way, he changed my childhood, my direction in life, and even my kids lives with interesting fantasy and hero adventures. Seriously, there are an entire galaxy, (far far away) of things to complain about before you start complaining about Star Wars. We all know the films. We all know the quality will be top notch. He invented THX Sound for crying out loud. I doubt the set will be below par. And if by some phantom chance they are lame, I'll be happy to come back here and amend my speculation. I love those that are down on Amazon for allowing reviews before the product is out. You guys just don't get business. What is going on here right now before the release is called \\"buzz\\" and it's a retailers dream scenario that a bunch of nerds would all congregate and debate the minutia of an upcoming product. Any press, buzz, or chatter is good for business. And finally, if you are down on Star Wars and you are here making noise how lame it all is, well, you and Jar Jar can be BFF.

B00E9A656K|5|So I had a complete restart of my device, ( I've done this before and had my profile intact on CSR before ) and I reinstalled the game. Instead of giving me my old account, it made me start over. I thought it would find my old save in the cloud later, so I deleted and reinstalled the game. Now it says my save is from when It made me start over before. Now I don't have my save. If you could help that would be nice. I did not have an account name, it was user-something and now I don't have that. I had a level 704 Koenigsegg CCX, 692 RUF CTR-3, and 642 Pagani Huarya. That's all I know. PLEASE HELP!

B00UVCI3EC|5|After buying Eric Clapton's 1988 CROSSROADS box set, I was no longer buying every album the guitarist released. In fact, since that time I've probably purchased no more than a half dozen or so of his albums. That's what makes this 3-CD edition of FOREVER MAN so enjoyable. It provides all the hits since CROSSROADS--there were only four--some side project material, and then cherry-picks songs from the studio albums. The 51 songs are distributed fairly evenly over three categories:  in the studio, live and the blues.<br /><br />Disc-1 STUDIO (77:37)<br /><br />Here are the hits:  &#34;I've Got a Rock N' Roll Heart,&#34; &#34;Forever Man&#34; and the million-seller &#34;Tears in Heaven.&#34; (The fourth hit--the live &#34;Layla&#34;--is on disc-2.) Other highlights include a couple of J.J. Cale songs: &#34;Call Me the Breeze&#34; and &#34;Anyway the Wind Blows,&#34; the latter from 2006's THE ROAD TO ESCONDIDO, a collaborative effort with Cale himself.<br /><br />Disc-2 LIVE (78:57)<br /><br />Clapton's guitar playing shines in a live setting and fans will not be disappointed with the fourteen selections here. Tracks 1-5 are from 1991's 24 NIGHTS and includes a powerful nine-minute performance of the Cream classic &#34;Sunshine of Your Love.&#34; Another J.J. Cale song, &#34;Cocaine,&#34; is from 1991 and was previously only available as a promotional single. Tracks 7-9 are from 1992's UNPLUGGED, including the acoustic hit version of &#34;Layla.&#34; Tracks 10-11 are from 2009's LIVE FROM MADISON SQUARE GARDEN (with Steve Winwood). The final three tracks are from 2002's ONE MORE CAR, ONE MORE RIDER. &#34;Over the Rainbow&#34; may seem like an odd choice, but Clapton provides a passionate reading of this chestnut.<br /><br />Disc-3 THE BLUES (72:25)<br /><br />This, of course, is what the Clapton faithful want from the man who is one of the best guitarists of the rock 'n' roll era. There is not a weak cut on this disc and there are no fewer than seven Robert Johnson covers.<br /><br />If there is a downside to this anthology, it is the packaging. There are two jewel cases housed in a cardboard digipak. Discs 1 and 2 are in one jewel case, disc 3 is in the other.  The booklets are rather skimpy as well. Discs 1 and 2 have a 8-page booklet with a 3-page essay from rock journalist Malcom Dome, two pages of song info (basically, who wrote and produced the songs and what album it came from--no musician information) and a couple of photos. The blues booklet is even skimpier at four pages. I always enjoy a track-by-track commentary from the artist, but the only comment from Clapton himself is in the essay from a 2008 magazine interview.<br /><br />However, if like me, you've only been keeping up with your Clapton catalog sporadically, this collection does a superb job of covering many of the highlights of the last three decades. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDrs.<br /><br />If there is a downside to this anthology, it is the packaging. There are two jewel cases housed in a cardboard digipak.

Good news is that if you are doing anything on the Web and using the Google Chrome browser, the sky's the limit.  If it displays on your PC, it can be displayed on your TV.  Lots of other apps are adopting it as time goes on.

B000002AH9|5|When I buy a CD, most often it's on impulse, just eager to hear what it's like. A very select few are ones I buy because of the acclaim I've heard about them. With LADY IN SATIN, it was the mixed reviews that got my interest peaked. Good, bad, in the middle, I don't care. I had to hear for myself. Needless to say, I'm glad I went with my gut, for I've heard truly one of the most authentically heartbreaking pieces of music ever in my life.<br />When LADY IN SATIN was recorded, Billie Holiday was definitely at the end of her life. Years of rough living & heroin addiction had all but put her formerly-honey sweet voice to shame. She was still a trooper though, for even as she was approaching yet another trial for drug possession, Billie approached this recording with the best of professionalism & even with her by-now-fading voice, she succeeded triumphantly.<br />It's safe to say you shouldn't approach this album without a box of tissues close by, for the performances on LADY IN SATIN are so true to life & heartbreaking, you're sure to be moved by hearing a once-great artist sounding like she's clinging to that last shred of life. The titles of songs like \\"Glad To Be Unhappy\\", \\"I Get Along Without You Very Well\\", \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\" & most notably, \\"You've Changed\\" speak volumes. To say this album might be her the story of her life would only be stating the obvious.<br />But the song that really says the most about this whole album is \\"The End Of A Love Affair\\". The version that made it onto LADY IN SATIN is a wonder enough, but the bonus track that has Billie singing a cappella & later saying she doesn't even know how the song goes is the tell-tale sign that as good as this whole album did turn out, it wasn't exactly a labor of love. In fact, in only 17 more months, she'd be dead.<br />Some say that Ray Ellis's string arrangements are a hinderance to the album more than a help, but they provide the best back-up for Billie's war-weary-yet-still-resonant voice. Both are very beautiful in their own ways, whether they're light or dark. The result is not all that different from Frank Sinatra's influential albums that he was recording at around the same time.<br />When LADY IN SATIN was released, controversy abounded from many corners. Some said that the album should not have even been released & was an insult to Billie Holiday's once-marvelous talent. But the more open-minded hailed it as a masterpiece, albeit a dark one. Even Billie herself claimed it as her favorite. The fact that she managed to hang on while she recorded this album is truly a work of nature when you consider her state of mind & life at the time. She would record one more album before her death at the age of 44.<br />However, it's rare that an artist can end their career having known they've recorded their masterwork. But with LADY IN SATIN, maybe Billie was right in singing its praises. Sure, she may not have been in the best of shape & her better days were behind her. Yet some of the best music comes from a lifetime's worth of experience & actually living the life of the music. With LADY IN SATIN, Billie Holiday did that & then some. Of course, listening to an artist at the end of her tether will not be an easy feat. Once you take the plunge, though, you'll feel greatly rewared that you did.Both are very beautiful in their own ways, whether they're light or dark.

B00ILHW6AG|5|Yes, not like most of Mr. King' s books but OMG what a story!!  It's a tease almost from page one, but like a hallway that gets darker the further you go, you know there's something waiting down there in the black at the end and its awful and terrifying. I'm addicted to Mr. King' s books - I admit it and I never want to be cured. In Revival you see and feel through the eyes of the main character who is well drawn but it's the Rev who is most finely sketched. Read it and b taken away to another place.
B003B02O7I|5|I'm never disappointed in John Grisham's books.  This one was no exception.
B008JFUPK8|3|Average movie.
B0028MBKVG|3|It is a good entertainment, however the author sometimes exaggerates and add lot of personal feelings.  Sometimes, I had the feeling that he tried to make it more exciting - artificial than it really was.
B007TBZ63Y|5|Just as in the previous stories in this series, the action is non-stop and the mythology is flying. I have to say, even though I was giving Jason and Piper a chance, Percy is still my favorite hero and Annabeth my favorite heroine. It may have to do with my long-time admiration for the Perseus story and the goddess Athena, and my not-much-fondness for the personality of the original Jason or the goddess Venus. Leo, however, is the best of the New Rome heroes to be added.<br /><br />I eagerly await the next installment. Can't believe I have to wait another year!
B00005LAIB|5|The same guy that gave this album 1 star and called it horrible also gave Godsmack a 5 star rating! That is hilarious...enjoy your Godsmack moshermaniac...If that makes you happy, then enjoy, but it's too bad, because you're missing out...I don't believe that Tool takes an &quot;open-mind&quot; or special brain power of any sort...it is harder listening, for sure, and if you can understand what they're doing technically, well I guess it helps in some ways and hurts in others...a lot of times music is more mesmerizing when you're blissfully unaware of what the musicians are doing technicaly...it adds so magic... and sometimes knowing what they're doing can let you into the fantastic world of creative and artistic music and that's satisfying in itself...Lateralus is much more complicated than most music, but in the end it all comes down to taste...if you don't like it you don't like it, but this is LIGHT YEARS ahead of a group like Godsmack in every respect...that's not really an opinion, that's definately a fact<br />I just think there is so much to get from this album...it really is an experience and you can take a lot from it and use it to do some good...I don't think it's dark at all, but that's just me
B005NPBTQ6|4|When I first heard Ashes @ Fire, I thought-This is not The Ryan Adams I Love to hear. It is clearly a love album  to his Wife; and perhaps- growing up? After listening over again I hear the brilliance in this album. It's not   your typical Ryan Adams, But nevertheless a soulful and loving tribute to love. When you're feeling down and need soulful restoration- Listen to this!

B004U8VX2M|5|I've always felt that this series was the best ever on TV, so having it available here was just a bonus for me. I had not seen it anywhere for decades, and season 1 was not available in the U.S. as far as I know. Anyway, it is a great treat for me, and free no less.
B00LDNE3FG|1|At first the game is really fun, but as you press on to harder levels, the game basically sabotages you. I can not tell you how many times I broke the glass of an obstacle and was still damaged. I even had the game freeze on me when I started to do good. I would highly recommend not paying a dime for the this game it's basically not even worth it.

B00005LOUP|5|I found Jim Carrey to be delightfully entertaining.  I think he has shown once again how versatile a character actor he is.<BR>I also found all the characters equally entertaining.  Especially Cindy Lou winning over the Grinch.<br />I enjoyed the interpretation of how the Grinch came to dislike Christmas.  I am sure any number of story lines would have worked, but this was very pleasant and entertaining.<br />This is pure entertainment.  Open your heart, I have long been a Grinch fan, and I think this fits along with the original to be treasured through the years.  How could your heart not grow two sizes?  Unless your the Grinch.

B002QW7AJY|3|You unlock this door with the key of imagination. Beyond it is another dimension...a dimension of sound...a dimension of sight...a dimension of mind. You're moving into a land of both shadow and substance...of things and ideas. You've just crossed over into: The Twilight Zone.<br /><br />But unlike the classic 30 minute Twilight Zone episodes, you will enter into over 90 minutes of pandorum with Pandorum. Pandorum being defined as dementia brought on by extended periods of hypersleep / suspended animation. In other words, if this movie was edited down to 30 minutes, I'd have probably been inclined to suggest that you not miss this movie if you are a fan of the classic [[ASIN:B000H5U5EE Twilight Zone]] series. But what ultimately is delivered with this movie--since there really is no platform to bring this story to you in 30 minutes--is a fluffy sci-fi thriller that would have been great had the fluff been removed.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster are great in the lead roles and could have / should have carried this movie virtually solo. Picture two guys who wake up out of a very long hypersleep with the side effect of amnesia on a deep space mission to an Earth-like planet in a distant galaxy. They are locked inside the chamber where their hypersleep units are, and they need to find a way out of the chamber so that they can restore power to their ship in order to continue their journey.<br /><br />Three key things happen: 1) One of the guys gets free of the hypersleep area. 2) They start to remember stuff. 3) They discover that their ship may be off course and that they may not be the only ones \\"awake\\" on the ship. (Okay, technically that's 4 things.)<br /><br />What happens next is scary, intense and thrilling at times. Silly, goofy and unbelievable at times. Thought provoking and reminiscent of The Twilight Zone at times. But most of all just a long (really long) episode of The Twilight Zone. Which isn't a bad thing. I loved The Twilight Zone, but I loved it at 30 minutes a clip. 90 minutes to tell the Pandorum story just added too much goofy and length to keep it far from the reaches of greatness.<br /><br />Do indeed give Pandorum a try when it comes on cable if you're into the genre, but save your money for a Blu Ray purchase of something more worthy.at 30 minutes a clip. 90 minutes to tell the Pandorum story just added too much goofy and length to keep it far from the reaches of greatness.<br /><br />Do indeed give Pandorum a try when it comes on cable if you're into the genre, but save your money for a Blu Ray purchase of something more worthy.
B0076DEJMO|5|Honestly, I probably wouldn't even be able to tell you if this book was terrible.  It was... the most satisfying read for someone who is a fan of Joe Abercrombie's First Law trilogy.  I imagine it's still a -good- book to those coming to the book without having read the First Law, as the writer has a fantastic handle on his craft.<br /><br />Abercrombie writes tales of bloody battles, shocking and visceral.  He crafts dialogue and character thoughts into something incredibly believable and oh-so-memorable.  His characters are more than flawed.  You can't gloss over them and call them imperfect.  Often his protagonists are genuinely BAD people, no imperfect about it.<br /><br />In Red Country, you get some kind-of not as BAD people.  Good people fallen on bad times?  Maybe.  Maybe more like the bad people of today.  Shy and Temple are intriguing characters.  They're not as marvelous as the cast of The First Law, no, but they also serve as the backsplash for the most memorable character of all.  The decision to never see the inside of Lamb's head is an interesting one, perhaps a little bit of a disappointment for those of us who enjoyed being in it.. but it was the right choice.<br /><br />This is a contained story.  Not an epic with ever-reaching arms.  If I described it to you, it wouldn't be satisfying at all - but it's incredibly worthwhile to read.

B00CNNPOHG|5|Fast shipment.  Very challenging.  We all enjoyed trying it out, even the adults.  Would work with this seller again.
B0016OVEYA|5|Even though I'm a fan of the book (never understood the claims by the detractors) I still love this movie, despite: the impossible notion of fighting an interstellar war with low-tech enemies, the ridiculous bombardment of Earth with asteroids from across the Milk Way (we'd be extinct before they got here!) and those darn, goofy Plasma Bugs (how much meat/grain/fungus would a creature have to consume to project its high-energy guano into orbit....) I like the Hoppers, Brain and Tanker, but I LOVE the Warriors (so cute and cuddly!). I think it's actually a good movie in its own right, even though Verhoeven's idea of satire is somewhat skewed - I mean why would you make your protagonists Fascists, unless you really liked them?? Must be a European thing. Of course, I'm not sophisticated enough to understand why you'd try to rip a work you hate in a semi-satire. Either try to be true to the work, or go for a flat-out spoof. Anyway, a great romp. Well worth it. Wish they had taken this much care with the rest of the series. Can't beat this movie for bug-slaughtering fun!
B008CX2A2I|2|This bluetooth dongle works well most of the time. The sound is much better than say a logitech bluetooth adapter. The biggest problem with this unit is that it doesn't allow you to watch a different source, while a bluetooth device is connected. Many of us want to watch a game, but play music instead of listening to the broadcast. This unit will not allow you to do it. Instead it will put some bogus paired connection screen on your tv. This all assumes you have hdmi video routed through this receiver. Really I am not pleased about this.<br /><br />Also it does not pair with the Galaxy S3. Major fail.
B00846REIS|5|Great!
B004A8ZWVK|5|This 2011 blockbuster, based on the novel by Kathryn Stockett, has reminded me  of the only aspect in the \\"Communist Manifesto\\" that Marx had 100 % right is that the workers and the poor can be exploited under a capitalist system.<br />  Thankfully in America, the situation can be improved by strikes, labor unions, petitions, the ability to sue employers, and what I would call the Dickensian approach( after Charles Dickens, whose well-known literary works helped reform British societal ills in the 19th century)--writing a good and effective expose.<br />  In the Mississippi of the early 1960s, the last of those becomes the objective of one young journalist, appropriately named Eugenia(Greek for \\"Well-born\\")\\"Skeeter\\" Phelan, a debutante, who, unlike most of her peers, feels there is more to life than bridge games, gossip, new dresses, and babies.<br /> A member of the Junior League, she is privy to the unjust aims of the local head of that organization, the villainous Hilly Holbrook(a firey Bryce Dallas Howard), whose petitions for the upscale homes in Jackson to have separate bathrooms for their non-white servants, due the the spread lie(highly reminiscent about those spread about Jews in Nazi Germany) that they carry different diseases than whites. These people who, while in many instances earning no real salaries, and who in some instances are willed to children by their masters, tend their gardens, clean their homes,  cook for them, and raise their children are deemed unfit to use their bathrooms!<br /> Also privy to this conversation is the middle aged maid narrating the story,Aibileen Clark( a world-weary Viola Davis), who works for Raleigh and Elizabeth Leefolt(Shane McRae, Ahna O'Reilly), and is the nanny to their toddler, Mae Mobley(Emma and Eleanor Henry). A neglectful mother to her child, Elizabeth, who is a weak-willed lackey to Hilly, is soon expecting another. We learn Aibileen has cared for 17 white children from the time she was in her early teens.<br/> In her Oscar winning turn as Minnie Jackson, the maid to the Holbrooks, Best Actress Octavia Spencer is a hard-bitten and sassy woman in a thankless job, and also raising six children while dealing with an abusive and drunken husband.<br /> Skeeter initially writes a newspaper column on housekeeping tips, some of which she gets from her girlfriends' housekeepers, and at home, she ponders the mysterious disappearance of the maid who loved and raised her, Constantine Jefferson(Cecily Tyson), an issue about which her ailing mother, Charlotte(Allison Janney) and her father, Robert(Brian Kerwin), are notoriously silent.<br /> As the Civil Rights struggle grows even further, Skeeter comes up with the idea of interviewing the maids of prominent families to inform the world of their plight in such crucial times. She contacts Harper and Row editor Elaine Stern(Mary Steenbergen) in New York, and through their phone conversations, we are led through various stages of the project's development. Notable moments in the Civil Rights battle are key to this aspect of the story as well.<br /> A side note to this story are the matchmaking attempts of both Charlotte and Hilly to fix Skeeter up with oil rig worker Stuart Whitworth(Chris Lowel). But Skeeter's project will have its impact even there.<br /> Encouraged by her pastor's(David Oyelowo) sermon about Moses, Aibileen, who keeps journals, reluctantly  begins her interview sessions with Skeeter, and Minnie eventually follows.We learn of the tragic death of Aibileen's son, Treelore, resulting from racist policies of the time, and follow  the blacks through innumerable slights and indignities.<br /> During a tornado, Minnie fans Hilly's dementia-plagued mother, Missus Walter(Sissy Spacek), and gets fired for not using the outdoor chamber despite the perilous weather. It is on this occasion that Missus Walter sums up Hilly's character in one sentence:\\"Daddy ruined you!\\"<br /> Appearing contrite due to her inability to find work after Hilly lied to other prominent families, saying Minnie was a thief, Minnie retaliates in a way that slaves --especially cooks had done in times past--by placing something unseemly in a food item and tricking the one who wronged them into eating it.Hilly will have the humiliation of having everyone in town know about it.<br /> There is a blatant irony to Hilly's presiding over a charity ball on behalf of starving children in Africa while treating the African descendants of her daily life with such contempt.<br /> As we discover, not only do those of Jackson's High Society dance to the music of those they are determined to keep as second class citizens, but Hilly's cruelty knows no racial bounds. She placed her own mother in a nursing home simply for laughing at what Minnie did to her.Skeeter gets in her digs at Hilly as well.<br /> Another person rejected by Hilly is the alleged bottle blonde, Celia Foote(played by Jessica Chastain with a Marilyn Monroe-like fragility). Deemed \\"White trash\\" by Hilly, et. al, she is married to Hilly's former sweetheart, Johnny Foote( Mike Vogel), and she is the only woman willing to give Minnie a job, especially since she needs to learn how to run a big upscale household.Minnie tends to her through one of her several miscarriages, and we see the sunny, bubbly beauty overcome social awkwardness to take a swipe at Hilly, and perform an act of kindness and gratitude that encourages Minnie to improve her life.<br /> The death of Medgar Evers encourages more maids to tell their stories to Skeeter despite great risks.<br /> Skeeter finally learns the truth about her own beloved Constantine's departure, which she is required to include in the book.<br /> \\"The Help\\" becomes a bestseller that causes quite a stir in Jackson.Hilly angrily denies the episode that all know pertains to her, and vows recriminations on those responsible.<br /> Aibileen and Minnie receive plaudits for their courage in church, Charlotte praises her daughter's courage, and the lives of the three female protagonists take different turns--in one case, at the expense of a little girl who loses the only person who truly cared for her at Hilly's command.<br /> But a final question asked of Hilly is one that could be asked of any perpetual hater with a vengeful streak: \\"Ain't you tired, Miss Hilly? Ain't you tired?\\"<br /> Aujanue Ellis plays the maid Yule Mae, who makes a fateful decision, Nelsan Ellis is Henry, the waiter,  LaChance is Constantine's daughter, Rachel,Ted Welch is William Holbrook, Ashley Johnson is Mary Beth Caldwell, and Anna Camp plays Jolene French.<br /> Under the masterful direction of Tate Taylor, and with an impressive score by Thomas Newman, audiences can review the truth about a not-too-distant time in American history in an emotion-laden and thought-provoking way.

B000OVLBIU|2|Ghost Rider has a thin plot and corny dialogue. The movie fails to pull the audience and excite them. the CGI involved is the highlight of the film but not enough to make it a success. Maybe children below 15 years of age might enjoy the movie but anybody looking for real (or not even that real) substance will be let down by this film. Avoid it if possible.

B007NWCZR4|5|As a fan of the Pet Shop Boys since West End Girls, they have always been ahead of the music scene. They started releasing albums of B-sides because they had so much music that people never heard. It also put it all together as opposed to trying to hunt down rareities and limited editions that they are know for. Format is their latest collection of great music that sounds pretty damn good. Some songs you may recognize, and the rest you'll just dance to. It took me a while to find this CD and it is worth it.
1596432594|5|I didn't know him until I bought \\"Surely you're joking, Mr.Feynman!\\" around 1989. At that time, I even didn't know he was a Nobel prize winner. However, when I read the part \\"Uh wugga wuh, Uh wugga wuh,\\" in the early part of the book, I laughed out loud for several minutes. That was when he became one of my heroes. Since then, I have read as many books on him as I could. So, I didn't expect too much on this book \\"Feynman\\" , except for one particular reason that it is a comic book.<br />But I was wrong. This \\"Feynman\\" has everything I have read in all those previous books! Even illustrated Feynman's expressions tell me his emotions that printed words failed to describe, and hand written words of him miraculously sound as his real voice in my brain!<br />I can't tell you should read this comic \\"Feynman\\" first, then all those books on him, or vice versa. At least I know of is, this \\"Feynman\\" is a \\"MUST\\" .
B004Y1WCDE|5|Great product.  Streams everything I ask it to.
B00CL50KDY|4|This is a well thought out comedy. There are some things that were inconsistent with a post zombie world but I think these things just add to the comedy.
B001V9LPWQ|4|It had been years since I had seen this movie. I had forgotten just how \\"dark\\" the original story was. Still, Disney animation is great, especially since it uses 70+ year old technology, and the quality of the Blu-Ray is outstanding. Not sure I would recommend it for younger kids, but for older kids, including those of us who grew up with this, it is a great addition to any Disney library.
B00BCX2F66|1|It is a perfect case up until it start to peel off in about 3 months.<br /><br />HTC claims product warranted but given the run around when it comes times to put a claim through.<br /><br />It's better to get the cheaper one. They last just about the same time.

B004SKHJF2|3|I got this app when Amazon had it as the free app of the day, but I used the free version for quite a while before that. It is very good at identifying songs as long as it has a good 15 seconds or so to listen without too much background noise.<br /><br />I probably only use it a couple of times a month, so I don't really need the paid version, but it is awesome when that new song you love comes on the radio and you can finally figure out who the artist is. And in my opinion, $4.99 is way too high of a price for this app. I think most people will get by just fine with the free version. -1 Star for the price.<br /><br />I have SoundHound installed as well. SoundHound has more features, but I find Shazam quicker and easier to use and when you are trying to identify a song before it goes off, this is important.<br /><br />Conclusion: This is a must have app for me, but not the paid version. Save your money and get the free version.<br /><br />Pros: Easy to use, works well.<br />Cons: Way too expensive.

030758836X|4|This well written and intricately woven novel gives us two married and memorable creeps, who deserve each other. They charm and beguile us by degree, and we, the discerning reader, vacillate between the two, deciding who is victim and who is the perp, only to have this wholly undone, in the very next chapter. I kept hearing the voice on my Garmin say \\"RECALCULATING\\", in her exasperated tone, as Ms Flynn toyed with my flimsy assumptions. And this in itself is the very subject of her book! Psychopaths are often gifted with a winning credulity, and the sneaky tricks the author deploys to manipulate us, are the same sneaky subterfuges that the couple use on each other, as well as all the gullible characters in the book. When the book was over I felt duped by what I thought was a fairly contrived ending, until I was forced to concede that this was also genius! Tied up in a Gordian Knot of their own making, eating each other alive for eternity!

0783229372|3|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />My biggest question of this film relates to the portrayal of the Naval Air Sailors at Lakehurst. Was it intentional to depict them as flat out incompetent. When the airship was prepping to land they dump streams of liquid (sewage, leftovers, water?) all over scrambling crew in disbelief, to imply they should have dodged a known protocol. Also, in trying to collect the tie down lines they behave in the manner of Keystone Cops, running in circles bumping into another. More running away from accident victims than helping. I never saw a hint of a 1937 era Firetruck or extinguisher. One would assume military style preparation landing a HUGE HELIUM filled balloon! The US was already chastised for such mismanagement in the film script. Hence, one assumed there were lessons learned with the increased inherent dangers closely after a LIGTHNING storm.<br /><br />I found the greatly muffled dialogue in the baggage compartment to be in need of captions. This was supposed to be a very quiet ride, why would they replicate excessive noise. No one appeared to have difficulty hearing one another, why should we? I found the real footage of the disaster immensely compelling knowing how many survived this horrific incident. Limited exploration of organized, competent personnel responsible for this outcome, a loss for the humanity aspect.<br /><br />I had difficulty comprehending the cartoonish bomb detonation scene. With other very complicated visuals, ship interior shots, editing of real vs model interplay, etc., why would the director resort to such a cheesy option. Who was the flayed man consuming the entire screen followed by an arbitrary stationary head shown with no expression? Very distracting when you expect to see a more life like replica of the most climactic event in the film.<br /><br />Overall, I did appreciate the commentary of the 1937 political climate of Nazi Germany. I was unaware there were concentration camps so early as well as the negative treatment of passengers by Gestapo i.e. interference with passports, luggage, inspections, and overall paranoia. This postulates a process of how the TSA could transition, if not close enough.<br /><br />The young deaf girl and the accompanying nuns evoked the most emotion requiring separation of mother and daughter to prevent 'classification' in her own country. Many elements of this film were intriguing, and the plot fairly believable save for one line. Hitler claiming this was an Act of God! Shocked to hear him give credit to an Almighty Being.<br /><br />Recommend for Zeppelin design, Hindenburg actual footage, and the memorable recording of &#34;Oh the Humanity!&#34;rly as well as the negative treatment of passengers by Gestapo i.e. interference with passports, luggage, inspections, and overall paranoia.

B00D2I8E46|4|Costello's most inspired recording in a good long while.<br /><br />You could argue that Costello's most inspired releases of the last decade plus have been with strong collaborators - Bacharach, Toussaint, and MacCartney. The Roots are another inspiration, and there's some dark gems on this unsettling, angry album. Costello's sounds relevant again.

B008673ZAQ|3|This is the second book in the Gideaon Cross series. I did not enjoy it as much as the first novel however it was a good light read. After FSOG, this is the next best thing. I have read some of the other knock offs that were rated 4 star and they don't come close to being to the level of quality of this book. However, to get a 4 star rating (like FSOG), I would have liked to see more of Gideon revealed, and a little less of Eva's dependency (she was all over the place). The pet names were annoying and parts of the book came across as contrived and not very beleiveable (i.e. old boyfriend never getting over Eva when all they seemed to have was a convenient sex thing). That said, I will buy the third book and look for a resolution to the Gideon and Eva story.

0156027321|5|This book starts out very slow.  We are introduced to Pi and his life in India.  I have to admit that the story is quite slow here and sometimes quite boring to read.  Be strong and keep on reading. <br /> <br />Once Pi and his family begin traveling the story picks up quite quickly.  From this point on the story is quite enjoyable.  It was worth the short bit of pain at the beginning of the book. <br /> <br />The ending of this book was a bit of a shock.  At one point I began expecting something weird but it was still quite memorable. <br /> <br />Some people have said that this book is about religion.  To be frank, I just don't see it.  Religion is definitely a topic of Pi's interest in the beginning but I don't think it is a major theme throughout the book.  <br /> <br />I don't think that you'll regret reading this book if you can struggle through the beginning.  At times, there are books that you feel a loss when you finish the book.  You feel like you are leaving friends behind when the book closes for the last time.  Pi is one of those characters.
B00BKELJZ0|5|I grew up influenced by the music of the 80s and 90s, particularly jazz and rock.  After the 90's when music lost it's flavor to the industry having grown too large and too concerned with commercialism, I almost stopped listening to the radio, nothing really inspired me.  Hiromi is the first in years who had me riveted to the car stereo speakers, on the night I heard &#34;Delusion&#34; on our local  jazz station.  I went right out and bought her CD Voice and it became a staple in my daily music shuffle, I never get tired of it.  Her latest album &#34;Move&#34; is just as much a musical odyssey as her last.  Hiromi is without question the most gifted musician I've ever heard sit in front of a piano. I'm quite sure when you play her music for the first time, you'll think so too.

1476738025|2|This rather simple tale about an &#34;old&#34; grumpy man who becomes something of a hero in his neighbourhood has received so many accolades I am puzzled. To begin with he is 59.... Which makes me older than Metheuslah. I neither laughed nor wept which makes me as hard as nails. Either way this book held nothing for me and I would never recommend it.
B005DC68NI|5|I read this after Let's Get Visible. Both books compliment each other very well, and I would recommend them to any independent author looking for info on how to market their book. They are must reads.
0553573403|5|I just want to write an additional echo to those that have already been written here.  I can't think of ANY book I've read in the past 5 years that will stay with me like 'A Game of Thrones' will.  Pure talent went into the writing of this book. For those expecting to read a fantasy on the heels of Terry Brooks, or Jordan or any number of novels in print these days beware: this book couldn't possibly be more different.  Magic isn't obvious.  Resolutions to problems are not neatly wrapped<br />in a package to put a smile on our face at the end of the book. Major characters may or may not meet an untimely demise.  Those who you previously thought were good guys may turn out to be as bad as they come.  In short, EXPECT the UNEXPECTED.  Go ahead and just TRY to predict what is going to happen.  I can almost guarantee you'll be wrong (if you end up right, you might wanna try looking into becoming one of those 1-900 Psychics...).  All of the traditional 'ideas' we have come to expect in a novel are thrown out the window with 'A Game of Thrones'.  Nothing is as it seems.  And expect a grand ride on a roller-coaster of pure adrenaline.  Simply put THE GREATEST Fantasy series in print today, and quite possibly the best of all-time.  I LOVED this book, I can't say it any more plain than that.  And as you can see from other's who have reviewed this book, I am NOT alone.
B004XD03RK|5|The 2011 Reissue of Death's magnum opus 'Human' is defiantely something not to miss out on. Especially for fans who still have the original pressing of the album, myself included, the guys at Relapse have done a phenominal job remixing this album. And when I say remix, I want to make clear: I use that term loosely, as the album has not be drastically altered to upset old fans(cough cough Dave Mustaine). So far listening to the original album, the only difference is that you can finally hear the amazing Steve DiGiorgio's magnificent bass work in the album, especially on the beginning of Lack of Comprehension. One major thing I did discover is that on See Through Dreams, where on the original album it segued into Cosmic Sea, it does not on this remixed version, instead fading out slightly before going to Cosmic Sea. The bonus tracks are especially nice, with the first official state-side release of the B-side KISS cover God of Thunder, and what a great cover it is! Great version! The bonus Demo's and instrumental takes on discs 2 and 3(depending on which version you get, I only got the 2-disc version) are very cool and very sentimental to the Death fans. You can hear Chuck and the band progressing this far for the first time and it is absolutely amazing to be able to hear these sessions. Many thanks to Relapse Records and Eric Greif for overseeing these fantastic reissues, and hopes for the continued excellence in the rest of the back catalog reissueing and the legacy of Chuck Schuldiner.
B00000JCOV|5|A good friend of mine introduced me to this album when I was a freshmen in high school (in 1999) and I loved it!!!  I would consider this one a classic but their next effort \\"Iowa\\" is a heavy metal classic among all.  Yeah there are a few weird moments, but that's what adds to the uniqueness that is Slipknot.  I don't like their newer albums as I feel they are selling out but this earlier stuff is timeless!!!
1451648537|5|A great book about an American Icon.  One can only wonder what great things his company might have accomplished had he not beeen the worlds worst manager of people and anti social in character.
B008MM9630|5|I love this app it's not all about fairies but your person is a fairy it's a lot like dragonvale except you take care of plants not dragons get this app they even have offers
B0067R0APK|5|I had the regular version of this app, and recently upgraded. It's very similar but more effective, and less glitches.
B00DR0PDNE|1|You're required to update the device when you first set it up, but the update hung on 100% and has been stuck there for hours.  I've never been able to use it.  This product is garbage.
B00B2166BS|5|Not sure it's necessary, but I much prefer the magnetic charger to using the USB port. It's easy to plug in and I never worry about yanking the cord, it detaches super easily, too.
B007J4T2G8|4|This book was very entertaining. It does get a bit annoying with Ana's persistant self esteem issues and nagging but over all the story is very sweet and just hooks you. There is a lot of sex. Personally I got bored with all the hanky panky, but the story was what got me. I have read the complete trilogy and will probly reread it again. I do recomend these books. I would like the author would write this trilogy in Christian's point of view as was started in the last book...Uggg... Such a tease.
B003L77G6A|5|In its fourth season, \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" has really come into its own. The characters this season are fully developed, with each making use of unique, believable personality characteristics. Whereas the earlier seasons were great because of the novelty of the characters, this season is all about interaction. Meet the cast:    Sheldon Cooper is the resident supergenius. \\"One lab accident away from being a supervillain,\\" Sheldon is socially awkward, yet he doesn't recognize it, nor does he particularly care about interaction with those of his own species. Actually, one could make the argument that Sheldon is not of the human species, yet this is where his humor is manifested. If you loved Sheldon in the earlier seasons, you will continue to do so: Sheldon continues along with his neurotic tendencies, his compulsive nature, and his obvious supremacy. Sheldon's interaction with the other characters continues to be the prime amusement, as Sheldon gains a \\"girlfriend\\" in Amy Ferrah-Fowler this season. Amy, a fellow socially awkward individual, is forced to date once a year by her mother; she decides that Sheldon will pretend to be her boyfriend so that her mother will rest her case, however, they soon develop an awkward friendship that is a quasi-relationship. Meanwhile, Amy bonds with the other girl characters, gaining girlfriends for the first time in her life. You get to witness such highlights of her development as her first sleepover.    Leonard, also a genius, is plagued by his recent breakup with Penny, the beautiful girl next door, yet they both clearly have feelings for each other. When Leonard begins to date his friend Raj's sister, however, Penny begins to get jealous, culminating in an unbelievable season finale. Raj continues to battle with his inability to speak to women as well as jealousy about the fact that Howard finally has a girlfriend. The relationship between Howard and Bernadette is taken to a different, new level, and provides a vast amount of laughs as well.    On the whole, definitely pick up this set. This series is not meant to be enjoyed one episode at a time, but in marathon after marathon. It's sure to instantly pick up your spirits and cause laugh after tear-streaked laugh!
B002JVWR4U|5|Dollhouse was a good thrill ride that ended too soon.  Eliza Dushku, as always, delivered an outstanding performance.  Joss Whedon was going to take the series in a great direction but because it got canceled, he had to wrap it up rapidly.  It didn't hurt the quality of the show but it did end up in a whole new direction.  I fully expect over time that it will become a classic.  And best of all, it has Eliza Dushku.  I got a rare opportunity to meet her in person and get her autograph at C2E2, the comic book convention in Chicago.  I have never met an actress who is more beautiful in person than she is on film until her.  Dollhouse is edgy escapist fun.  Enjoy.
B00HZ3C4N6|4|Well written and good characters. If you like Jason Borne, you should like this one too.
B000002UA5|5|Although David Gilmour doesn't like it, it's just his best album in the group. The live set is sublime: &quot;Astronomy Domin&quot; and &quot;Careful with that axe, Eugene&quot; easily surpass the original versions. The studio set shows inventive experimentation; the highlights are the bucolic &quot;Grantchester Meadows&quot; and the fantastic &quot;Narrow Way&quot;. I prefer this album than &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (very good too, but pretty polished).
B00ECUX7HC|4|Another fine collection of music from the matrimonial stew brewed by Tedeschi & Trucks.  The songs are likable and the ensemble is inspired and lively as usual.
B00JKGYSAI|5|Gift for our daughter, just the right price, and even got a free download of the cd for her iPad. Good deal for the money.
6300271447|5|This isn't your run-of-the-mill concert video packed with edited performances.  This is loaded with performances from the original (and, as far as I'm concerned, the ONLY) three-day festival of peace, love, and music.  (...)it's loaded with interviews of kids coming into town for the festival, enjoying it, and leaving it (I felt really sorry for the cleanup crew).  A lot of the time, it's a split screen so you'll find yourself using the rewind button quite often to catch anything you may have missed.<br />Interesting to find out that Woodstock was the second performance for Crosby, Stills, and Nash (in the days before Young).  Ritchie Havens was out of sight, Jimi Hendrix far out, and Country Joe McDonald a blast.  Rock and roll and folk music came together for a once-in-a-lifetime event that could never be duplicated (why did people botther trying?) and, truth be told, I'm deeply jealous of the people who were there.<br />The coolest part of all was when Max Yasgur, owner of the farm the festival was held on, got on stage and said that Woodstock was proof that young people could get together and have three days of peace, love, and music and nothing but three days of peace, love and music.<br />This video is a first hand glimpse into the turmoil that was the 1960's (e.g. older people arguing amongst themselves that the festival was wrong because the young kids were having sex and getting high while others thought it better that they were there instead of being in Viet Nam).  You can feel the tension and the too cool atmosphere of the festival through the TV.<br />Ah, nothing like the 1960's.  What a decade!

B007N8RULO|5|Spider Solitaire is one of my favorite pasttime games. This is a great version. It's easy to learn and has some ways of changing things up so it never gets old. The app loaded quickly and easily and works great. If you like solitaire, I recommend this one!
B007HACDLK|5|The story is so plausible and the details so real the reader feels he/she has a better understanding of what is happening in our government and our world.
B004J4WKTW|5|This book is beautifully written all the way through. I couldn't put it down. Morgenstern's characters and story are dazzling. My new favorite book. Perfect.
B00004T9UF|4|As a kid, I used to hate this album for its lyrical references to violence. Now things changed. The Marshall Mathers LP features brilliant beats. This album made a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records since it became the fastest selling solo album ever with nearly an astounding 1.8 million sold in its first week, and it went on to sell 19 million worldwide (Wikipedia). It's #302 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The songs \\"The Real Slim Shady,\\" \\"Stan,\\" and \\"The Way I Am\\" were singles, but the tracks \\"Kill You,\\" \\"Who Knew,\\" \\"Remember Me,\\" \\"Drug Ballad,\\" and \\"B**** Please II\\" have beats that will entice you.

B001ANSS5K|4|Another great adventure book that teaches us what is really important in life and why some people see it differently.
B000R7GKQE|5|This is one of the few shows on television worth watching. I am afraid that it will not last much longer due to the trend in TV to present irreverent and inane content. The show has shown love between family members and concern for the fellow man. I love the series and I like to watch the collection uninterupted by comercials. Good buy, I bought this set as a gift to my daughter for Christmas.
B003EI2EH2|4|Unusual and interesting.  Tim ferris is awesome.
B000NA28I4|1|I really wanted to scream out everything wrong with the movie when I watched it--\\"You know Brom's horse was WHITE in the book!\\" \\"Arya is and E-L-F! Ya know, POINTED EARS?!?\\" It was a very poor substitite for the     R-E-A-L Eragon. Here are the Huge downsides to it:   - You idiots! Arya is an elf!! And may I remind you, Eragon rescued her UNCONSCIOUS, in a prision cell, in Gil'ead!    - They didn't even visit Dras Leona or Yauzac! No Hadarac Desert, No Isidar Mithrim!    - Brom and Eragon practically hate each other in the movie, in the book there was a lot more with brom and Eragon, and when Brom died you're just like, \\"Big Deal, nothing special!!!\\"    - The stupid directors just put some armor, tough expression & beard on some people and called em' Dwarves. And whatever happened to Hrothgar?   - What about Murtagh? Oh, he was only there for 5 minutes, Murtagh was a huge part of the book, and now he's like as important as dust.     - Saphira changed from baby dragon to adult dragon in 2 seconds!!! Stupid.   - Saphira couldn't even breathe fire in the first book! And she won the battle by just doing that.     It infuriated me to see a great book thrown into a stupid movie. If you have read Eragon and go watch this movie, believe me, you will be sobbing or screaming your head off by the end of the movie.
B0047Y0FGY|4|If you enjoy Tina Fey's TV shows and movies than you will like this book.  She talks about the challenges she has faced at each point of her career (from just starting out to the balance between kids and a career).
B008XG1X18|5|I love having this on my phone and tablet for quick access to Pinterest! It's very useful for when I'm at the store and trying to buy things for something I saw on Pinterest but can't remember everything that I need. I just pull it up on my phone and voila!

B000000W5L|4|It never ceases to amaze me that this is considered the best of all Stones albums.  I mean it's good, even great, but it's so different from anything they'd previously attempted that I'm surprised it hasn't been consigned to  novelty status like their first step away from the hit-making machine,  &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot; (which I also own, and  like).<br />Almost nothing on Exile comes to mind when you think of  &quot;classic&quot; Stones songs (The only attempt at a &quot;classic&quot;  song, &quot;Rocks Off&quot;, sounds forced and doesn't compare with earlier  rockers like &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;).  Indeed, several tracks, like  &quot;Turd on the Run&quot;, &quot;I just wanna see his face&quot;, and  &quot;Sweet Virginia&quot; are sufficiently obscure that I'll bet whole  tours go by without them getting played.  The album is so blues-centered as  to scarcely belong under the Rock n' Roll rubric.  If someone told you that  Muddy Waters wrote &quot;Ventilator Blues&quot;, you'd believe him. But  this remains the benchmark against which everything they've done in the  almost thirty years since is measured.<br />Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised.  The Stones have always eschewed the status of artistes of 60's rock. That  title belongs more to Floyd or the Velvet Underground (or even the  Beatles). They've always kept grounded to dark R&amp;B roots that created  them.  But here, they made something so true, rich, and messy, that if it  isn't art, it's really really close.
0790730960|5|Batman Returns in my opinion is my finest overall of the Batman series. The first one was excellent with good ol' Jack as the Joker. He is just the man! and who could forget him and his crew destroying the paintings while Prince' funk song \\"Partyman\\" plays in the background {very funny scene} But the 1989 Batman is now a snapshot in time a film of the past. 3 years went by and we are in 1992 with Batman Returns. Gone is the artsy quirkiness of the original. This sequal has a much darker and angrier undertone to it. The first one kind of had an Autumnal feeling to it {especially the scenes showing Wayne Manor.}Michael Keaton is once again awesome and tough as Batman and believably sophisticated and melancholy as millionare Bruce Wayne. Michelle Phieffer is sexy and mysterious,and kind of nerdy as Catwoman/Selina Kyle .Danny DeVito is hiddeous as the deformed Penguin. Christopher Walken is a real creep as wealthy businessman Max Schreck {I feel sorry for any secretaries that have a boss that soulless}In this second chapter of the series Batman battles the disturbed Penguin who tries to become Mayor of Gotham City. And Catwoman who is hellbent on killing her boss and getting our hero \\"out of the picture\\" until she and Bruce discover a shocking secret about themselves. There are some really awesome scenes in this movie. the part in the beginning when the bat signal reflects off the Wayne manor walls and Keaton stands up in front of it, very nicely shot! Michael Keaton is the bomb as Batman!nobody can replace him! also the scene when Batman has to get away from the cops and the sides of the batmobile split off and the torpedo car flies through the narrow alley.  Tim Burton is such a cinematic and artistic genius too bad he and Keaton didn't do all four Batman movies... If you had the privledge of seeing the first one on the big screen, Batman Returns is the one you wanna see next. Both are of 5 star quality in terms of casting design production and music If you have anyinterest in Batman or are a hardcore fan of his legacy like me, see the first two batman films they will not dissapoint!
B00V4JJPKM|1|Had a few good parts but seemed like a pointless plot.  Kept thinking it was over but it kept going.  It was very disappointing to me.
1451695195|4|interesting subject, well described experiences, thought provoking.  I would recommend this book as providing insight into a fascinating look at what is another realm of reality.
B005GSZZ1A|4|It's heart breaking to read about this young men's life and how he managed to survive the only way he knew how. Even if that meant betraying his family for death. Hopefully more people will become aware of the horrific condition of north Korea and do something to save many people's lives in those horrific prison camps.
0399226907|5|A friend of mine in Blowing Rock, NC had this book and my son was always so fascinated by it.  I ordered it and he has not put it down.  It is a great board book made very sturdy and is so informative about counting AND nutrition.  Very pleased that I finally ordered him his own copy.
B000MKD9P6|5|Meryl Streep and Ann Hathaway were great.  Emily Blunt stole scenes.  She is an excellent actress and I will purchase films in which she appears.
B00005JMD3|4|Based on the 1970s TV series, S.W.A.T. is a great story with just enough action to keep you going, without overdoing it.<br />Jim Street (Colin Farrell) and Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner) are partners on the Los Angeles Special Weapons and Tactics team. When a successful hostage rescue results in a lawsuit for the department, hot-head Gamble quits the force while Street accepts a demotion, hoping for a 2nd chance. That 2nd chance comes in the form of Lt. Dan \\"Hondo\\" Harrelson (Samuel L. Jackson), a departmental war horse assigned to restore the division's reputation. He hand-picks a new team with Street as its top dog. The other members include Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez of Blue Crush and The Fast and the Furious); David \\"Deek\\" Kay (Rapper L.L. Cool J); T.J. McCabe (Josh Charles of Dead Poet's Society); and Michael Boxer (Brian Van Holt of Basic and Windtalkers). Throughout their training period, we get to know a bit about each team member. Their individual personalities really come to life.<br />Meanwhile, a French criminal kingpin named Alex Montel, played by Oliver Martinez (\\"Unfaithful\\"), is caught and imprisoned, and offers $100 million to anyone who can help him escape. The Team is now up against a bunch of money-hungry LA mercenaries which will include some familiar faces.<br />Great action movie. Naturally, most scenes are stolen by the legendary Samuel L. Jackson and the young, hot, Irish actor Colin Farrell. But the other team members shine as well and add so much to the team and the film. Definitely worth it.
B009NG1Q96|5|Can't wait for the third book to be released. I have read the first 2 three times and impatiently awaiting the next.
B006VRDZ44|5|This show is excellent  - the acting, the writing, sets, cinematography, whatever. I can't stop binge watching this!  Highly recommend.
B000FBJAOG|5|The Zombie Survival Guide was perfect as an entertaining yet thought-provoking piece. Although clearly fiction, the book provides information that makes you think, which I really appreciated from the text. The given description does a good job of preparing a potential reader for what they are about to read as well as supplying some key tips the text covers. The feel of the text is a good casual read while still having that how-to-survive-guide feel it's based on. I would 100% recommend this book to anyone even remotely interested in the zombie apocalypse.
0439023483|5|I'm really am a grandma and I loved these books! They're not just for teens though that is the &#34;target&#34; age group--- interesting enough for older age groups --and even thought provoking.

B00006AW63|5|great movie, very entertaining!
B008F5YDRI|4|Rating: 4.75<br /><br />Salmon Fishing In Yemen is a delightful movie.  Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt have wonderful chemistry together and Ewan is wonderful as a staid government worker caught up in his every day life and a marriage where neither party is particularly happy or appreciated.  Then along comes a sheik with an improbably idea, to build a river in Yeman where salmon could live and provide a living for his people.  The title makes this sound like a comedy but it's really more of a tale of one man coming back to life and learning to dream once more.  The cinema photography is wonderful.  I loved the scene of the Scottish Highlands.  The character of the Yemeni sheik is charismatically played by Amy Waked, a man going against the tradition of his people to find a new path for economic survival.  Emily Blunt also gives us a wonderful portrait of a woman torn between two men, her fiance at war and the repressed man she is working with.  Terrific understated performances are the measure of this movie, directed by Lasse Hallstrom.<br /><br />There is something for everyone to love here.  A very civilized and lovely romance, a movie about fly fishing and the needs of salmon to live and thrive, a bit of espionage against the project and so much more.  I think this is one you will find yourself watching over and over.
B0000VD04M|5|Ed Wood (1994) is Tim Burton's best all-around movie. Not his most popular, perhaps not his most enjoyable, but definitely his finest overall. It's the (mostly) true story of Edward D. Wood, Jr. Wood was a rabid movie-lover who passionately wanted to make movies and didn't care what he had to do to make it happen. There was just one problem: Ed Wood had about as much filmmaking talent as the megaphone he shouted through. In addition to his lack of talent, Ed liked to wear womens' clothing. Sometimes, he supposedly even directed his movies while wearing womens' clothing. His first film was a debacle called Glen or Glenda, one of the most painfully inept and mind-blowingly awful movies in the history of cinema. He followed it up with such disasters as Bride of the Monster, Night of the Ghouls and his \\"masterpiece\\" (so to speak), Plan 9 from Outer Space. The latter being a highly-regarded cult classic, often inaccurately cited as the worst movie of all time. Burton's film covers the making of several Wood movies, chronicling his personal struggle to get his films made, his difficulties with women, and his friendship with aging actor Bela Lugosi. Wood doesn't seem to know that his movies are terrible, either that or he just doesn't care. He's just so happy to be making movies that he doesn't care that they're awful. He wanted to be a writer-director-actor just like his idol, Orson Welles. In a way, he succeeded.     Wood is played magnificently by Johnny Depp. I believe this is Depp's best performance. He is wonderful as the passionate, relentlessly optimistic Ed Wood. He disappears into the angora sweater-wearing character. I'm not sure how Johnny Depp didn't get an Oscar nomination. He deserved it as much as anyone that year. However, Martin Landau received a well-deserved supporting actor Oscar for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi. Landau's performance is so good that you'd swear Lugosi returned from the grave to appear in the movie. Ed Wood is generally regarded as a comedy, and while it is very funny, it does have many dramatic moments as well. Depp and Landau have some really great, touching scenes together in the movie. Wood was Lugosi's only friend in the latter years of his life and their friendship is at the heart of the movie. The photography and production design are top notch. The look of 1950s Hollywood was recreated meticulously. The black-and-white photography immensely enhances the old-movie feel.     This is a great movie that is so frequently overlooked among all the great movies that came out in 1994. Even in Tim Burton's filmography, the film is often overlooked. Anyone who loves cult movies, or just movies in general should see Ed Wood. It's an offbeat, unusual masterpiece that tells a fascinating story about   a man who made up for his lack of talent with an abundance of passion.
B00BEJL6Q8|2|It's become clear that popular movie franchises have a morbid immortality -- you simply can't kill them off, even when every character in the movie dies. This is why &#34;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&#34; -- which concluded with the entire planet being nuked -- was followed by &#34;Escape from the Planet of the Apes.&#34; So perhaps it's no surprise that &#34;300,&#34; a movie based on a comic book based on the real life Battle of Thermopylae, spawned a sequel. SPOILER ALERT: 299 of the 300 didn't make it. But a little fact like that wasn't going to stop director Noam Murro from making &#34;300: Rise of an Empire&#34; based off Frank Miller's unpublished graphic novel Xerxes, which was inspired by the real life Battle of Salamis.<br /><br />The first problem is that there is no Gerard Butler. The sight of digitally-added abs is no longer quite as thrilling when it first debuted in &#34;300,&#34; but leading man Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) does his best surrounded by his fellow Athenians. The primary difference between the Athenians and their bloodthirsty Spartan brethren from the first film is that they talk a lot more. Themistocles is single-handedly responsible for killing King Darius I of Persia (Igal Naor) with a well-placed arrow at the Battle of Marathon. Puppet master Artemisia (Eva Green, a whirlwind of blades and bosom) encourages Darius' son Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) to seek godhood and wage war on the Athenians, due in no small part to her own thirst for vengeance at having her family slaughtered by them. So in short, the slaughter of the first film is pretty much all Themistocles fault.<br /><br />The first few minutes of &#34;Rise of an Empire&#34; provides a satisfying explanation as to the freaky weirdness of the Persian army from the first film. Yes, Xerxes really is a supernatural giant; yes, he really does have cat-like monsters and giants in his employ; and yes, this is all pretty biased against Persians but when you loosely base a movie off of historical events, someone ends up being demonized. Unfortunately, some of this narrative is robbed of its urgency because we're to believe second-in-command Artemisia is behind it all. So yeah, &#34;300&#34; is also all Artemisia's fault.<br /><br />What ensues are a series of naval battles that are essentially land battles with boats. Instead of firing arrows at each other, the Greeks close to melee combat by ramming. Instead of just waiting until the Persians close and stay safely on the shore, the Greeks engage them in the water with a much smaller force. And instead of using brilliant tactics to engage the enemy, the Athenians use a CliffsNotes version of history: fog, land-locked territory, and a bunch of other feints come from seemingly nowhere. This is all supposed to be Themistocles' doing, but it's hard to believe him; his abs speak louder than his words.<br /><br />All throughout, Themistocles keeps trying to get the Spartans back into the fight by having long, stilted conversations with Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey). This has the added unwelcome effect of Gorgo narrating different parts of the film with grave dialogue that seems like an Ancient Greek word association exercise.<br /><br />There's a subplot with Athenian fathers and sons that lacks any gravity due to the actors involved; a girl power sex scene in which Artemisia attempts to forcibly seduce a bewildered Themistocles; and not enough Xerxes. Seriously, when you have a gold-skinned giant leading your army, a hellcat warrior in designer outfits pales in comparison.<br /><br />The &#34;300&#34; franchise's primary claim to fame is its blood and gore, but the special effects are subpar here too. Characters don't so much explode with blood as they eject it from random places on their armor -- it looks like painted-on special effects. Because the film lacks much in the way of 3D-ness to justify the price tag, there is always stuff floating in the air -- ashes, blood, dust -- anything to enhance the 3D experience that isn't there.<br /><br />If &#34;Rise of an Empire&#34; was its own film, it would be merely be a platform to let a bare-chested Eva Green gloriously tear up the scenery. But as a sequel to a superior first installment, it's a soggy mess.e 3D experience that isn't there.<br /><br />If &#34;Rise of an Empire&#34; was its own film, it would be merely be a platform to let a bare-chested Eva Green gloriously tear up the scenery.

B00005UT85|5|always loved this album since i bought it on vinyl back in the 60's. they are one of the best least known groups i know of. exceptional musicians and song writers.
030746363X|4|This is a great book and I've enjoyed it a lot. I love how it covers a wide variety of topics as they pertain to fitness and health (even sex). The only critical thing I have to say is that it seems many of the methods Tim talks about include supplements and equipment that I don't possess. Obviously the object of the book is not too easily hand-deliver results to me without any work on my part, so I do not blame Mr. Ferriss for this problem. It just seems like there are more things to buy beyond the book in order to accomplish some of these outcomes and being a minimum-wage 18 year old student, I can't fork over a ton :) but again, this is a great book and I am VERY happy Tim wrote it!    I plan on experimenting more once I get a better job. This is a wonderful book and I would suggest it to anyone who is thinking about it.
B00L23RCPU|5|For fans of Anderson, this is everything you would hope it would be.
B006LRUVUA|5|Teamviewer is really a great product on a PC (I used it to teach my 70+ father Windows XP going straight from DOS).  Its also been great for supporting my kids across the country with their PC problems.  I checked it out on my 7&#34; tablet and it works just fine with a few adjustments, but in a pinch it can be a lifesaver.  Thanks and &#34;play fair&#34;!
B00G4PX1MO|5|Best game ever!
1476729085|5|Very funny with lots of OMG moments.
B004FOA84A|4|As others have said... a little short. Good graphics, fun puzzles. Music was repetitive. I didn't understand what the two beams were all about... More, please!
B00DHKKN6Q|4|FUN GAME TO PLAY
B00712Y28Q|5|Awsome fig
B0091REZMW|4|the graphics are great. I really like this game so far. It very easy to navigate and I like that it doesn't have a lot of ads popping up throughout the game.
6302787300|5|1492: Conquest Of Paradise is truly an amazing movie. Nevermind all the bad things that have been said about 1492. Most people couldn't accept FRENCH actor Gerard Depardieu playing an ITALIAN mariner living in SPAIN. Nonsense. He is an actor, let him do his job. 1492 is a movie, and a very good one to say the least. I like Vangelis score in 1492, most people do, it is dreamy music. Ridley Scott has plenty to work with here, he perfects the material he was given to direct with. As is the case with all of Ridley Scott's films, the movie looks gorgeous from start to finish. 1492 is visually incredible, it is Ridley's most perfect movie. Fellow cast memebers who play alongside Depardieu are all very good. Depardieu himself is probably the sole reason alone why this movie works so well. The ... editors review says Depardieu is at sea with the material he was given to perform with. Um, no. Depardieu is fantastic as Columbus, he is quite a brilliant actor, the rest of his performance is left to the imagination. Also in that editors review, the editor wishes they would all just sail off the edge of the world. Well, that would make for great action in the movie, but reality is so much more interesting. This is a movie about Columbus, his ships and his life. There is no better version. If you want a taste of what Columbus's voyage and the man himself might have been like, than 1492 will do just fine. It's amazing. It was released back in 1992 to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the discovery of a New World. If any of this subject matter interests you, than you will not be disappointed with this Ridley Scott audio/visual masterpiece.
B00DR0PDNE|5|I really love my Google Chromecast.  Having an Xbox it's kind of annoying to have to pay for the gold account just to have access for Netflix. This allows me to stream to my tv for free.
B001LM1456|4|very good movie to watch lot of action<br /><br />i recomened it to a friend  or somedody close to my family
B00GSZEBE2|1|This is why I don't play games. I enjoyed this game, even though it was repetitive. I played for weeks. Had fun. I was up to 40 levels, with 55 bitizens. Now the game has reset itself back to the beginning. Thanks for everything, and goodbye, Tiny Death Star.
B006BXTOFC|5|One of the best bands in the year 2012.  Classic feel rock group with a excellent tracks!  This is a must have in your cd collection.
B0015DYIH2|4|Definitely continued (a bit predictably) the story of Bella & Edward & wrapped up some loose ends, but also leaves you wondering what will happen in the future....but this is the last book!
B003EYVXXW|5|Nice Movie
B00DURILJ2|2|I had high hopes, but Mud was pretty bad.  Story line was weak, ZERO in character development...and nothing really ever 'happened'.  There were so many underlying stories, that also went nowhere.  I ADORE M.M. and it pains me greatly to give this flick a big fat thumbs down.  Save your money, or watch The Paperboy....That was a great one.

039472903X|5|David Ogilvy was, in the words of Ed Ney (Young & Rubicam) \\"... the best of the best.\\" His magnum opus \\"Ogilvy on advertising\\" remains one of the best sources of inspiration, information, and just plain smarts of the advertising industry.

Anyone in the ad business who does not have a copy of this book is not serious about his/her craft. Highly reccommended.
B000UEDTUE|5|I'm just a hobby-level artist trying to branch to different media. I prefer sketching and charcoal but have wanted to try out watercoloring and these pencils seemed to be a logical progression.<br /><br />I'm no expert by any means but will try to point out the best qualities of these pencils.<br /><br />First off is that the colors are incredibly vibrant and look amazing on paper. The pigment completely dissolves when a wet brush is applied and the pigment can be pulled from the pencils themselves using a brush and applied directly to the paper. Obviously you can use them dry and they react like soft core colored pencils. If you use a wet application after though you can't tell pencil was used as the colors are completely dissolved. The colors are permanent though once dried which is great because it allows for more layering.<br /><br />I sharpened them by hand to expose roughly twice as much of the cores then with a traditional sharpener so I can use them for burnishing easier and also to pull color from the core using a brush directly. The cores are holding up incredibly well, I have no fear of them breaking even with almost a full inch exposed.<br /><br />Another small note worth mentioning is the quality of wood used as well was apparent to me when sharpening. The wood actually cut away and was soft enough that it wasn't a huge hassle to sharpen all 36 of them by hand. A small point obviously but I felt worth mentioning.<br /><br />The case itself is nice, I chose this over the tin to shave a couple bucks off and I liked how the gift box looked. The flap that opens also has a magnet in it to shut the box together and can be used as a stand.<br /><br />The only downside is of course lack of colors. Not that the set is lacking per se but some colors are missing. Examples are lack of flesh tones, greys and browns. Jerry's Artrama supply (spelling) here on Amazon sells the individual pencils as well but you'll need to do a bit of searching to find them. I'm supplementing this set with about 20 pinks, browns, fleshes and greys.<br /><br />I'll be adding some pictures soon. Need to paint some examples and also waiting on a paper block to be delivered.<br /><br />If you want actual artist quality watercolor pencils then the Albrecht Durer line is what you want. They're fantastic.enting this set with about 20 pinks, browns, fleshes and greys.<br /><br />I'll be adding some pictures soon.

B009LDCZ7I|4|Gotta love Carrie!
B00IG2DOKM|5|Really like it.
B000002L9M|5|I'm young. All of these reviews seem to be written by adults who listened to this album way back when. But I just discovered DM, and I'm listening to 'Black Celebration' and it's wonderful. All of the songs are great. I think I'll try abother one of their albums. They make my happy. \\"Death is everywhere/There are flies on the windscreen.\\"-DM 'Flies on the Windscreen'

B00GEEB730|5|Loved it!
B00EJXX17S|5|This girl rocks! Check her music out!
B0065AVS0K|3|An amped up version of the Untouchable television series, Fast paced extremely violent movie about the actions of the hoodlums, psychos, and toughs of society and the cops who try to protect us from them.  and by the way- the women are mostly gorgeous!
B008X8P8A8|5|This is a very fun and exciting hex-style real time strategy game. The game has a great campaign to play through and enjoy and it also includes a skirmish mode to increase replay value. You can upgrade units and get more using experience points that you earn throughout missions. There is also an offline multiplayer mode to play with your friends. Overall its a great game worth the money. I recommend it to strategy fans.
B00HV8TN7K|5|Wow. All I can say.
B009K6DKTS|5|This is a very unconventional book which defies categorization: philosophy, economics, politics, financial markets, statistics, probabilities... It's also one of the rare books that makes the reader think, and think in new ways - also the reader will be looking at news, newspapers and television will gain a new perspective. The book revolves around the Triad theme: what is fragile, what is robust and what is anti-fragile in different systems and contexts. I recommend reading either Black Swan or Fooled By Randomness before Antifragile. Highly recommended.
B00XOXDXV8|5|Witness!!!!
B0054JZC6E|3|Very good at playing games but a little hard to get points to open all games. Easy to understand, but sometimes hard to beat.

0393312836|5|The Kubrick movie won Best Picture, and it deserved it. But you should read this book because the language-Nadsat-is beautiful, once mastered. Of course, the story is important for us today because much of Burgess' predictions of the &quot;near future&quot; have come to pass.Open your newspaper and you will find Alex's droogs are alive and well in your neighborhood.As a political/morality tale, it is a classic.Kubrick really couldn't explain Alex as well as Alex can, even though there is some necessary narration in the movie, or else the Nadsat spoken would not be understood.<BR>So,buy it  and enjoy! Let &quot;Your Humble Narrator&quot;(Alex) explain all!
B009TGXLZM|4|Great movie for everyone to see the origin of where the books we have read and cherished for more than 100 years. ill read today. Uplifting to see how an artist changed the world.
B008GXHOFW|1|I grew up on the Amazing Spider-Man, so this game truly offends me with its horrible gameplay and crap graphics. I would venture so far as to say that, even if I weren't a fan of Spidey, and were simply a casual gamer, I would still be offended. There are two reasons why I didn't give this a one star rating: 1)I got it for free, and 2)the game does function. So two stars for not having had to pay for this mobile piece of junk, and for it starting. Had I paid for it, I would've def given it one star. You know what? Never mind, I hate this game, so I'm changing it to a one...*mouse scrolling up to Star Rating...clicking to remove second star...going back to body of review*...there, I give this one star. It sucks.
0061122416|4|This is a great book if you're going through a time when you are questioning your point in life and wondering what you should be doing with yourself.
B0072GPQNG|5|Beautiful movie!  What an interesting story to tell.  I loved it.  I was expecting something totally different and was incredibly surprised.  I love a good war film and though this was more about the horse than the war, it was still a phenomenal war movie.
B00IYJDE3E|5|What's not good about this addictive show about kings Queen's land greed sex and war
B006IGZWB2|1|Yawn.....Watched the first hour and gave up so save your money for a better one. I do not nderstand the high ratings for this SLOW moving film.

0307279189|5|I hate running--and even I loved this book! A friend told me her husband LOVED this book, although he LOVES running, but I bought it for a gift and decided to read it too. It reads really fast, and it's super interesting--I think everyone should read this book! It's not just for runners--it's really about how all humans are &#34;Born to Run!&#34; And while it did not motivate me to become an ultramarathoner, it completely changed how I think about running
B002SEQ8ZM|4|I wanted the Real D Blu-ray version.  This version was okay.  I enjoy 3D very much.  I think all movies<br />should be made available in this format.  Moving into the picture with your eyes and brain fundamentally<br />gives you more textures, colors, and spaces to wander in.  It absolutely adds interest to the experience.
B00FVVR2ZO|4|Love these type of games. This one's pretty good. Love that the objects aren't in the same place every time.
B000SGGUWS|5|Total page turner. Couldn't stop reading it! If you watch the show you should definitely read the book! Love it!
B00A3NQNUU|5|My sister made me get this game because she is extremely addicted to it. I found that I also love it and it is addicting (except when you have to wait for a dragon to hatch). Another thing is that you don't need a Facebook account for this app you can just bypass it and continue to play.
B0072OFM28|5|It was the completion a wonderful series. It well  deserved a five star review. The action and story plot is that of an epic adventure.

B0000524CY|5|This movie is about a twelve year old girl named Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) who starts to act strangly.  Her mother, Chris (Ellen Burstyn) takes her to different doctors day by day and do numerous tests on her (spinal taps...etc.).  They find out that nothing is medically wrong with her and consult her to find a priest.  Since Chris is not a big religious person, she goes to a Jesuit priest, Damien Karras (Jason Miller).  He tells Chris that her daughter is possessed by an evil force and needs to have an exorcism.  After seeing \\"Help Me\\" on her stomach, he pleads to the Catholic Church to approve of the exorcism.  Father Merrin helps Damien proceed in the exorcism as Regan's body starts to turn into a demonically figure.  When they find out it's a demon named Pazuzu (Mercedes McCambridge) who is possessing Regan, Father Merrin starts to doubt his fight for her life as Damien starts to doubt his faith.  As the demon takes full control of Regan, the exorcism starts to go downhill.  Father Merrin and the demon have already fought once before and Pazuzu now knows all of Father Merrin's weaknesses.  Pazuzu ends up killing Father Merrin and now Damien is on his own for the fight.  When he sees there is nothing else to do, he tells the demon to come into him.  And he does, then after fighting within hisself and the demon, the demon throws him out the window and he dies.  Now Regan is freed from the evil force of Satan....or is she????
0140186409|5|What you're looking at is one of those slightly oversized paperbacks.  It's quite handsomely done, and the print is largish and easy to read.<br /><br />On the down side, the text merely consists of the text itself:  there are no footnotes or a glossary to help you with extinct terms and stuff, but there is a longish prefatory essay by Robert DeMott (with suggestions for further reading) that is quite an able piece of writing.
B0090EHVMC|2|I think we didn't finish this movie.  It just didn't capture our attention which is unfortunate because it is a good story.  I definitely like the 15 minute storybook better... sometimes stretching out a story doesn't work so well.
B0057EYACI|5|Jim's work will forever live in my heart. Talk about a national treasure taken from us way too soon! Jim's 3 albums were all released during my High School years, and Jim's hits were always spinning on the radio. AM was still king, and they always sounded great on the car radio or 8-track players. What casual fans, or those that didn't invest in the albums didn't realize was that Jim's enormous talent was only skimmed on the radio. SO many deep tracks that are essential are here, as well as bonus material. For a few dollars, this is the best volume to score. The EDSEL set reviewed here delivers slightly improved sound than the 50 Anniversary sets that are OOP. The 50 Anniv. sets seem slightly bright, though excellent sound, also. This EDSEL sound is a little warmer to my ears, and the booklet is chock full with lyrics, notes, and photos.<br /><br />Listen to my generation's premier singer-songwriter, and experience his gifts to all of us...<br /><br />All the best,<br />GT
0452282152|5|I read this a while back and enjoyed it very much. I have since passed it on to my wife and she also enjoyed it very much. It is interesting to read someone's fanciful account of a well respected piece of art emerged.

B005D9MUWY|5|I bought the original SwiftKey keyboard in the Android Market and they gave us the free upgrade to SwiftKey X and I seriously doubt that I'll use any other keyboard, if you want to swype that's your business, if you want to use that reptile sounding T9 that's your business but SwiftKey is for me.
B009VB97EY|3|This was an entertaining film overall.  The most fun part was watching the guys dance.  The dance themes were creative and the men were good dancers.  The story line was OK but a little thin and there wasn't a lot of character development.  Overall it has entertainment value, especially if you don't want to think too much.
B005R32L66|3|Skype is a great app for people to chat through a webcam for surely. The only problem I have with it is that video is lost some times and they could improve the graphics  (unless that's the other persons camera) but Skype is way better than Face time. I gave Skype 3 stars because of how good video calls are and plus they added a lot of stuff that isn't needed. I have been using Skype for quite awhile. This app is great for people who aren't to picky with their video calls but is still a pretty great app.
0547258305|5|I got this series for my birthday, and I blew threw them more quickly than I thought. They're a fantastically fun read, and you WANT to know what happens. I wouldn't say this book is 100% appropriate for kids, there's talk of brothels, the heroine is against marriage (REALLY against it) and it's portrayed as a semi bad thing... but it's a great storyline if your child can handle those things and understand their purpose in the book. You'll love the characters in this book, even the bad guys are awesome. I can't wait to read more of this author's work, I had such a fun time reading this series.
B003TSEEDY|5|Loved it! Would defiantly recommended to anyone who was that kind of person in school lol. First book I've finished in awhile.
B002ZG999U|5|A great all star action movie.
B00BUCXVPI|5|I enjoyed this movie very much. Great suspense and action. Perhaps one of the most underrated movies staring Tom Cruise.

B000002U82|5|Generally regarded as one of the essential albums of the rock genre and spending an unbelievable amount of time on the Billboard charts uninterrupted (somewhere around 15 years if I recall correctly), Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is a rarity, an album that actually lives up to its reputation.  Truth to be told, I haven't listened to it in several years before writing this review (like many folks, between my own listening and its endless airplay, I've burnt out on it), and the experience for writing this review has been quite rewarding. <br /> <br />One important thing about \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is that its an album statement-- it feels like one long song broken up into ten movements and its an exercise in studio wizardry.  Its also the point in the band's career when the songwriting of Roger Waters was beginning to apex but not at the exclusion of the works of any of the other band members, and as such is probably the last Floyd record not to dominated by Waters' personality (his stamp is pretty hardily felt, however). <br /> <br />The album generally sticks midtempo, picking up now and again, slowing down now and again, generally maintaining a haze in the pieces and a strong sense of unity-- it intertwines themes of aging and passage of time with that of madness, and endless slight reprises of either theme, mood, or sound effect lends a strong sense of unity to the pieces. <br /> <br />The songs themselves are pretty well known-- \\"Time\\", \\"Money\\", and \\"Brain Damage\\"/\\"Eclipse\\" have all received high rotation on FM radio, as has, to a lesser extent, \\"Breathe in the Air\\" and \\"Us and Them\\".  Add to this a couple effects driven pieces (\\"Speak to Me\\", \\"On the Run\\", the latter of which feels to presage synth-driven instrumentals), a wordless meditation on death (\\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\"), and a beautiful instrumental meditation (\\"Any Colour You Like\\") and you've pretty much got the record.  It reaches its apex at the end-- \\"Eclipse\\", a brief, often overlookedsong, with a fantastic three-part vocal harmony building part-by-part over the swirling backdrop. <br /> <br />If you don't own it and you're looking at this page, this is one of the essential rock albums, you probably should own it.
B003ZDZ1WG|5|Saw them open for Rascal Flatts in concert and fell in love.  Yes the music is great also.  Bought both their albums and am waiting for the next.  I would spend the money again to see just them in concert even without Rascal Flatts.
B0051ANPZQ|4|A wonderful, moving story.  Uplifting with humor and insight.  I've recommended this book to family and friends.  I'm looking forward to reading more stories by the author.

If you do not like books that have, too many mysteries you should not read SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES because the book has many mysteries that need to be solve.  I recommend the book to readers who like to solve mysteries and to those who want to have a good time while reading a book.  The book is 293 pages long it is very long but is worth it because you get the chance to read a very cool reading book.  The book has many life lessons that can teach you how to deal with daily life problems.  I learned many life lessons from the book one thing that I learned was not to be nave when people are warning you about something that could hurt you and you do not even listen to them because you do not trust them.  The two main character of the book are James and Will who are two cool teenagers who are trying to solve a mystery in there home town city of Green town, Illinois.  Well I hope you read SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES by Ray Bradbury because the book is fantastic.  <br />

B00HEQOAQ8|5|Wonderful movie. Every one should own this movie and the t.v. series!
B00JB3MVCW|3|Not what I expected; but well acted. The story was very surreal. Rather long and drawn out.
B00785P2QC|4|I just started playing, but it's an entertaining game. I'm not crazy about the Facebook interface to get points, but I can live with that. Having played the game for awhile now...  still fun, but lots of tapping.
B006LSZECO|1|I bought the book so I finished reading it even though it was very poor writing.  It was so boring that it took me forever to read.
B00BOYLRE4|1|A favorite movie destroyed.  The sound is not synced with the picture - a fraction of a second delayed.  Many scenes are so dark as to be almost black.  Many glitches in the video.  Don't buy this copy, you will hate it.
B00QW8TYWO|5|To buy this seriously awesome and addictive app!!
B00L9B7IKE|2|I found this book tedious in the extreme.  Not fast-paced, not a thriller.  The characters weren't relatable, they were boring.  The alcoholism was grating, and far too repetitively convenient as a plot point.  I'm giving it two stars because the writing was decent -- not compelling, but Ms. Hawkins knows how to put sentences together and has a decent command of grammar, a skill not shared by a lot of current authors.  Her plotting is another matter. The overall plot wasn't bad, but along the lines of what another reviewer wrote, instead of putting the effort required into writing a truly engaging story with unfolding events, the author just had her narrators withhold detail so she could have a series of plot twists.  I knew who the killer was halfway through the book.  The final twist was the most satisfying, but it was an effort to finish the book to get to it.
B000059HCN|5|Few movies leave one actually thinking afterwards, this is what makes this movie stand out, aside from the fact that it refuses to censor the dreary underground world of a junkie.  To add to this film's morbid appeal, is a cast that breathes life into the desperate characters-and makes them real to the audience.  To tie it all together are fantastic film techniques, and a haunting musical score.  What else is there to say?  This film is not for the squeamish, but for those with open minds and a taste for innovative films. Kudos to you Aronofsky.
B001DJ7PR8|3|I have been reviewing Woody Allen productions in this space over the past year or so. I have highly rated such old Woody classics as \\"Annie Hall, \\"Manhattan\\" and \\"Radio Days\\", those memorable films with New York City its trials, tribulations and traumas as an epicenter. I have also given mixed reviews to some of his later productions like \\"Manhattan Mystery\\" and others based in other geographic locales (\\"Purple Rose Of Cairo\\", etc.). I was, however, fully prepared to fulsomely praise the film under review, \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\\", after having heard the hype about Penelope Cruz's performance as, Maria Elena, the talented estranged artsy wife of the central male character, Juan Antonia (Javier Bardem), a Spanish avant guarde artist. After viewing the film Ms. Cruz's performance was certainly Oscar-worthy. Nevertheless the overall production falls flat. And here is why.    Woody Allen has created an important cinematic niche for himself as a performer, director, writer and producer in that netherworld of the alienated modern urbanite, especially of distracted women unsure of their place in the world and their ability to navigate it with (or without) a man. The classic examples of such angst and confusion were various film vehicles created for Diane Keaton (\\"Annie Hall\\") Mia Farrow (\\"Broadway Danny Rose\\", \\"Stardust Memories\\") and along the way Woody himself, his doubts and his inhibitions (in about six billion of his films starting with \\"Take The Money And Run\\"). Here Woody has gathered the old familiar concerns about sexual inhibitions, the vacuity of upper middle class suburban life, the eternal problems with the opposite sex and various social conventions like bisexuality, adultery, threesomes and the like. All very familiar Woody material, although not always set in Barcelona.     With the above-mentioned exception of Ms. Cruz the other characters are Woody's stock and trade of late: young woman with various personal and social problems, with or without Woody asconduit. The truly beautiful and talented Scarlett Johansson is wooden here as Cristina. The lesser known actress, Rebecca Hall, playing Vicky's role is the same. In the end I did not care whether the two women (or three, if we include Ms. Cruz) got their issues resolved, or not. That is not a good sign in a Woody Allen film where in earlier, better films , if nothing else, we are at least left wondering about their fates. Woody, come back to your New York hearth and home with all its tangled energies, excitement, enigmas and hangups. There you are \\"king of the hill\\". Leave Europe for the kids.
B005DJREGQ|4|Good teen drama and hilarious.
B0000DD7LB|4|When I bought this cd I expected the typical Britney Sound. But - I was surprised - she made a totally different kind of music. It is kind of dance music mixed with pop. The song 'Breathe on me' remembers me of the Australian singer Kylie Minogue. Britney fans will be surprised, but hopefully in a good way!
B000006TRV|5|Not only does this CD keep you alert, because every song is unique, it also makes you think. From the acousting &quot;Hey you&quot; to the well-known &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot; each song has a lot of meaning. You can listen to this CD in two ways, you can just enjoy the talent that went into the music, or from the extreme Pink Floyd fan's view, and recognise the amazing symbolism in these songs.
B007SUW24W|4|Granddaughter loves it
B00192KCQ0|5|Although most of their fan-base feels that they \\"lost their touch\\" with 'Load', 'Reload', and 'St. Anger'...I, for one, liked those too.  But I also like their old stuff (except for '...And Justice For All').  'Death Magnetic' is really good and definitely worth buying.

0307454541|5|I read them in French before they were translated into English. They took France by storm also. The first was recommended to me by the owner of a bookstore, and I was a bit doubtful about reading a 700 page book in a foreign language. But after starting, I was hooked. I read the entire 2100 pages without stopping to read anything else, and, at the end, grieved that there weren't any more. It's that kind of story.
B00004VVN9|5|Not too many people have seen Showscan movies. For some reason, they were released in (I think) selected Chucky Cheese's pizza shops.<br />Some friends and I drove 2 hours across Missouri to see Showscan and it was the most realistic picture we had ever seen.<br />Showscan was a 65mm film presented at 60 frames per second (fps). Studies had shown this to be the frame repetition rate at which the brain would integrate the frames seamlessly and accept it as true motion. Most movies are 24 fps, although each frame is shown multiple times to reduce flicker.<br />But you can tell that it's not real. US TV, which operates at 60 fields per second approximates the Showscan presentation. The difference between this and normal films is obvious - most people can tell a video source from a film source. They may not know why the video seems to have more presence, but the frame rate is the answer.<br />Brainstorm was originally produced to use Showscan projectors for the times when people were experiencing \\"reality\\" with their headsets. This would have clearly stood out from the rest of the film, and would have seemed much more real.<br />Perhaps only Doug T. saw the project in the 24/60 fps version. I know I didn't. However, from my experience with Showscan, I can state without reservation that this would have been one hell of a film as originally conceived. The \\"reality\\" changes would have more than made up for any other problems with acting or scripting. The \\"WOW\\" factor would have overridden all other criticism.<br />As for the dialog and acting being a little clunky - well, have you ever seen early stereo or 3D movies? They tended to concentrate on exploring the technology instead of the picture. Perhaps Showscan could have evolved to the state that 3D did with Hitchcock's \\"Dial M for Murder.\\" Or perhaps not.<br />In any event, this would be an excellent roadshow movie (like the restored version of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\") to show what the movie should have been.<br />And perhaps on a future DVD we'll have the helmet versions of reality replaced with 60 fields per second video. The difference should be obvious.<br />Thanks, Doug, for trying to pull this off. If you ever want to invite me to see your master copy with Showscan, I'll be out in California in an instant!<br />Rick
1594484805|3|Was expecting more from this book. Much of the book's focus was on how to apply a &#34;new&#34; motivational theory to economics and business. In this sense, the book's greatest strength is also its greatest weakness: while the human motivational component that it explores is great to know about, I find it hard to apply it to certain areas of work/employment. For instance, it's maintained that motivation and truly abides and produces continuous, progressive results is that motivation that stems from autonomy, self-directedness, creativity (etc), yet this motivation is hard to apply in context where one's work itself is a mixture of analog and heuristic work (the former being work that follows a set pattern and/or series of steps and the latter being work that doesn't). Recommend this book . . . but buy it used, if possible.

B002MQYOFW|3|Honestly, I don't understand why Suzanne Collins made Katniss. Katniss is a very unlikeable character. Seriously, who would want their child to look up to a girl who is on the virge of suicide and dispare. And then there is the romance. WAIT- What romance? She says she thinks gale is good looking but then shows no intrest. Then when Peeta says he &#34;likes&#34; her, she trys to stab him in the throut. then later on in the series falls i nlove with him. And even there it doesnt seem like she loves him. Then there are the twists. You already know that Katniss and Peeta are going to end up together. Ut what you dont realize is that its all a big show and then you notice that later on peeta doesnt even love her. and then you are confused. does he love her? Does she love him? And a the end of the third book .... it doesnt give you much details does it? I think Suzanne Collins made a harsh mistake writing these three books.
B00E72OKAS|4|The title says it all really, this game is just a lot of fun. A good variety of vehicles and upgrades, abs a good spin on the genre epitomised by Hill Climb Racing

1594744769|3|\\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" follows the story of 16-year-old Jacob. Jacob is very close with his grandfather, who has, from Jacob's earliest memories, told wild stories of his childhood. He even has the pictures to prove it. Granted, the photos look cheap and doctored to Jacob's 21st-century eyes, but that doesn't change the fact that the stories are fantastic. It stops being fantastic as Jacob nears adulthood, however; his grandfather claims that monsters are following him everywhere he goes, that they're going to kill him.  Jacob dismisses it sadly, believing his grandfather is slowly losing his mind. His belief is shaken when his grandpa is mysteriously murdered, torn apart in the woods behind his home. Jacob is the one who finds his grandfather. Just as the paramedics rush in, Jacob spots a horrific monster prowling the scene.<br /><br />Of course, it disappears.<br /><br />Jacob is thrust into therapy by anxious parents. The trauma is slowly driving him mad. At the suggestion of his psychiatrist, Jacob decides to spend a summer at his grandfather's childhood home, a small island off the coast of Wales. It is there he discovers that all his grandfather's delightfully insane stories are true. What's more, the very same children in the photographs are alive and well, hidden because they are just as threatened as they are dangerous. They're threatened by mysterious, awful creatures called hollowgasts. The problem is, these childen can't see them. In fact, only Jacob's grandfather could. As it happens, so can Jacob.<br /><br />I liked the story, but I didn't particularly like the book. It wasn't exactly bad. The ideas regarding time travel were interesting, and the hollowgasts and wights were pretty awesome. But \\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" felt undeveloped. It starts off well, with Jacob's childhood recollections, and stays quite decent up til his first night at the \\"Home.\\" It sort of unravels there, feeling rushed. There is nextto no character development, with the exceptions of Jacob and his grandfather. Emma's character started off promising, until she forgot Jacob's grandfather, a supposedly decades-old love, in a proverbial heartbeat. While the book is well-imagined, it isn't fleshed out very well. The explanations offered are shallow, simplistic, and almost happy-go-lucky in a way.<br /><br />It was a pretty fun story, but it had no depth. I found it very boring in some places. It looks to be the first in a series, and while it's a very narrow margin, I'll probably pick up the second one. It shows just enough promise. Thus, by the narrowest of margins, I'd recommend you pick it up. It's a fair rainy-day read, though not much more.
020530902X|5|This is still the best style manual for American English. However, the Kindle edition is not the Fourth Edition. It appears to be based on the original edition by Strunk prior to White's involvement.

0316228532|2|Honestly I just really didn't like this book. It was slow, soo long, and had way too many characters to keep track of . I quit halfway through, which I almost never do.
B0041KKYEM|3|I really looked forward to this movie, hoping it would be Natalie Portman's break out role, but alas it was little more than [[ASIN:B001TOD92C The Wrestler]] with ballerinas.  Aranofsky has no knowledge of how the ballet, much less the creative process, functions.  What he tries to create is another visceral experience, filled more with \\"wet dreams\\" than any sense of dance or the stage.  Since Natalie is obviously not much of a dancer, we see this production almost entirely from behind her right shoulder.  Symbolic perhaps, but downright annoying when it comes to seeing any dance.  Of course this movie is not about dance, it is about poor Nina's painful metamorphosis, as she tries to shake the claustrophobic world of her mother (Barbara Hershey), who had forsaken dance to have her, and get past her own limitations of \\"perfection.\\"<br /><br />Mila Kunis adds a little intrigue as Lily, but Aronofsky uses her as little more than a sexual foil to Nina's growing ambitions.  The ballet master might as well have been played by Piers Morgan, as he does little more than frown and genuflect when Nina fails to give him the \\"black swan\\" he so much desires.  He taunts her into masturbating, supposedly to unleash the sexual energy he is looking for in the role.  Portman spends most of the time looking lost and confused, not sure where Thomas (Seymour Kassel) is going to go next, until she finally gets her moment on stage and literally becomes the black swan.  Although I have to say I was impressed with Winona Ryder's portrayal of Beth.  Ryder is virtually unrecognizable, and gave the character more emotional energy than any of the other actors did their characters.  In the end this is little more than a children's story with some steamy scenes for adults, fading out exactly as had The Wrestler.
B00AKEMHCA|5|Best game ever!!!<br />I love this game but on playing co-op I see submarine type things and I don't have a submarine tower plz tell me why!
B001OQCV6K|5|Every so olften along comes a production which flies in  the face of all we hold dear, and then blows us away with it's fantastic story, superb action and acting, marvelous sets and CGI'd effects.  Robert Downey may seem more at home being &#34;Iron Man&#34;, but his conditioning makes him a formidable Sherlock Holmes as well.  Jude Law makes Doctor Watson seem much more credible, as he should be, and since he is an ex-Army surgeon his decision making must be spot on, or else death takes over!<br />Fortunately for us there is ample backstory to this film, wherein we can see how the London of the 19th Century was magically restored.  The dialog allows the story to move at a quick pace, but yet does not swamp one with too much detail that obscures or confuses the plotline.  Just the opposite!  Holmes brings everything we need to know to the front, leaving only a few sparse details to be unfolded at the penultimate moment.<br />I have loved the old Rathbone/Bruce films for years, and can appreciate the following they built for the &#34;adventures&#34; of the world's first and foremost forensic detective.  The Jeremy Brett/BBC productions also brought a sharp degree of authenticity to the series of adventures — and like the Rathbone films, these also kept basic adherence to the original Conan-Doyle writings.<br />What seperates those fine presentations from the one being reviewed here is — cleanliness!  That wonderful time was not the age of antiseptics, clean water, unspoiled food or clean clothes.  Horses littered the streets (along with their undeisrable leavings), drawing the carriages of the day — and hence their passengers, to the desired destinations.  Sewers were just beginning to come into being, not to mention proper indoor toilets.  Truth be known, the Romans had it much better than Londoners did in Holmes original time!  Yes the film is a bit dark, because those were not the brightest of times!  Plague eliminated whole families and classes of people due to the lack of practical hygiene and medicines to deal with unknown pathogens.  As my parents told me about the Great Depression here in America: &#34;Those were not 'The Good Old Days'!&#34;  So I can aappreciate what the producers went through to see their vision of the time come to fruition.  In my book it succeeds marvelously!  And, if you — like me — find this film outstanding, then be sure to just go ahead and get the 2nd one as well: &#34;A Game of Shadows&#34;.  And, if you have the proper equipment, get the Blu-Ray versions, as they will reveal a whole other world to the viewer who appreciates the fine details and wonderful atmosphere that make a good presentation WONDERFUL!  Five stars seems too little reward for a film of this stature, but because the stars do not interfere with the movie, nothing is lost.<br />(P.S.:  I also liked the film &#34;Sherlock Holmes Smarter Brother&#34;.  That should show that I am NOT biased.)
B001UV4XIS|5|The movie part 1 and part 2 are great. They deliver the essence of the Deathly Hallows book fairly well.  A few alterntions dont detract from the story too much.  Such as attributing and giving the credit and line to Hermoine about using the dragon when in the book it was Harry's idea and few other minor changes.    Almost 100% of the one star ratings are regarding the ultraviolet digital copy and not about the actual movie.  So the overall three star rating for the movie is seriously skewed by the poor reviews about the digital copy and not the movie.  As with most reviews on Amazon, you have to wade thru a lot of nonsense reviews to get to a few valid serious reviews about products.
B00004T8RK|2|It usually takes a while for me to appreciate each PJ album but this one never came around.

0061784788|5|James Rollins is unique in that he makes science readable to the layman (and woman).  This book was also highly enjoyable to me as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints as Mr Rollins gave a credible explaination for the \\"White Indians\\" whose remains have been discovered on this continent.    He elaborates on the extraordinary intelligence of Thomas Jefferson and the further history of Merriweather Lewis and a plauable adjunct to American History.    His explaination of nano technology is unerstandable to layman as his examples of other scientific theories have been understandable in  his other books. NOBODY had ever been able to explain sub-atomic particle physics until his example of waves/particals in his book, Black Order.  .  PLUS, he loves animals!!!

0380804557|5|This is an excellent modern &quot;folktale&quot;.  Gaiman includes all the  techniques of folklore without ever being self-conscious or drawing our  attention to the device.  The opening, in which we are engaged with the man  we think will be the hero, turns out to be a false start, the true hero  having been born of the union described in the opening.  Helpers and  hinderers abound as he goes about his quest.  The story has the internal  logic necessary for fairy tales and is carried off superbly.  I personally  would have ended it right before the epilogue, by I do not dispute the  author's right to end it as he has.
B00DUGCLY4|4|This app is cool... but i wish they would give you more than one coin per question you complete.  I also do think they should get rid of the ads since they already have a way to get money from people when they buy coins.  Maybe they should make it so that after you buy a coin pack, the ads you get on the bottom of the screen will dissapear.  But dont get me wrong... this app is amazing and can be quite entertaining for quite a while.  Also its free... so you've got nothing to lose.  Why not try it out?

I did learn new things that didn't make this a wasted purchase, but this is not a book that gives you guidance as to rep counts and how to stack your workouts. I wish it had that as well, it would make my star rating go up. If you find yourself injured or uncomfortable in positioning this would be a good book for you. I haven't seen any tips like this before and found it helpful to apply with the knowledge I already have acquired.

B00HB62MC0|5|Let’s see what kind of review I can muster up in my zombie state as yet again Colleen Hoover’s writing kept me captivated all night long making it impossible to put her book down.<br /><br />Ugly Love is definitely different than Colleen Hoover’s other books. It’s one her most heartbreaking and also hotter pieces of work. But no matter what, you know you’re guaranteed a little bit of everything in her stories. She always delivers some:<br />- wittiness,<br />o good laughs,<br /> unforgettable lines,<br />• a story you’ll always remember,<br />o heartache,<br /> a heartstopping love story<br /><br />The way she wrote about Miles past was so unique. Very little words used but yet the way they were written was enough to get the point across. These few and strong words grabbed you and made you feel in just a short amount of time.<br /><br />As always Colleen Hoover has taken over all thoughts of mine. Except they’re not my thoughts, they’re memories of the agonizing lonely journey Miles was on for 6 years till he met Tate. Over and over again, on constant repeat it’s all Miles and Tate, Miles and Tate, Miles and Tate…and Rachel.<br /><br />One thing I really have to thank Ms. Hoover for, is not turning Miles into a man whore. So many times you see that happen but not with Miles, he is just a big hearted loving guy needing to mend his broken heart. Thank you so much Ms. Hoover, thank you for doing right by Miles.
B007J4T2G8|5|This is the first installment of the Fifty Shades Trilogy that is truly an obsessively overwhelming story of love for both characters Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. While it's an extremely downhearted, unconventional developing relationship between the two, it's also an intensely absorbing passionate journey. If you've ever been addicted to anything in your life, the similarities are invoked in this can't-live-without, absolutely addicting relationship! From experience, this fictional narrative is so true-to-life that you absolutely will not be able to put this book down: breathtaking, heartbreaking, passionate, dangerous, codependent mannerisms, dark peculiarities, and loss of self-being are all the traits that make this story so powerful. To give up oneself whole-heartedly to any one person is dangerously hazardous to a person's being, and that is exactly what happens in this tale.  The eccentricities and abnormalities of this story's thesis and the erogenous territory it treads, make for one intriguing read. And so the story begins...<br /><br />Christian Grey is a multi-millionaire young entrepreneur who is dumbfounded when Anastasia (Ana) Steele walks into his office for an interview for her college newspaper. Ana who is finishing up her senior year in college stepped up for her roommate to get some notes on Mr. Grey, while her roommate suffers at home with the flu. Unbeknownst to Ana, Christian is amused and mesmerized by her appearance and subtleties. And after she leaves his office, he will begin his quest on literally tracking Ana down just to appease his attraction for her.  Upon his pursuit and according to his plan, he and Ana once again coincidently meet. And it will be from this moment on when Christian asks Anastasia to join him for coffee that the most erotically breathtaking unity of two people originates.<br /><br />It is truly one of the most emotionally compelling developing relationships ever told...bittersweet to be sure. For you see, Christian has a very dark, deep-seeded past that has wounded him psychologically, which causes his behavior (the fifty shades) to be sporadic, aloof, alienated, and threateningly domineering (Dom). And this is also where the BDSM undertone enters into the story. While this is not, per se, a BDSM novel, it does give insight to the possibilities of becoming just that. It is a one-of-a-kind horrifically carnal, intensely passionate uncharacteristic love story. Couple that with two of the most profound characters and you have one brilliant narrative! Extremely overpowering premise! Highly Recommend!istian has a very dark, deep-seeded past that has wounded him psychologically, which causes his behavior (the fifty shades) to be sporadic, aloof, alienated, and threateningly domineering (Dom).

B000J10ERO|5|This movie is one of the greatest and on the top of my list of movies. The DVD is great and comes with a lot of special features and commentaries and all that good stuff. Brandon Routh does a spectacular job as Superman; the plot and storyline are great; all the actors and actresses really did a great job in the movie (and I don't even like Kate Bosworth that much); Overall, its a great movie- a must have.
0061914177|4|The following are excerpts from my review posted on January 12, 2010 at [...] and here's the actual link: [...]    Great book, I really enjoyed it. Gary Vee is not just entertaining, as it turns out, nor is he simply driven. He's an inspiring, thoughtful businessman and marketing strategist who looks well into the future to anticipate trends; all the while, keeping his eye on the ball. So what is Gary's #1 strategy? CARE.    Here's the deal: Gary can explain in his book, exactly what he means by \\"caring,\\" and the thing is that it really isn't any different from the approach taken by good old-fashioned great brands, all over the world. It is one thing to say that you care, but it is an altogether different thing to actually live it. What are some of the great caring brands of our times? How about Nordstrom? How about McDonalds? How about Starbucks? He says it boils down to the quality of the communication, and he's right. \\"It's about listening.\\" You listen, you give it your all, and you make adjustments when you need to.

B00IG2DOKM|4|I like how we can play but have the chance to get the items by playing and not by always asking for stuff from other people.
B0019IMVDG|5|True story of how the mob lost Las Vegas to the big corporations.  Acting is fantastic.  Story is riveting!  From best-selling book.  Virtually every fact checks out.
B008JJM88Q|5|It is spot on.  Even guessed the dead parrott from a Monty Python sketch.  How the heck does it do this?????
B00GINENG0|1|its really boring game ,its cute but don't keep interest
B007TK77QE|1|found the descriptive  details in the first  100pages execessive I gave it up at that stage I may go back and maybe its gets a lot better later but was it worth the efford of wading through the early part?
B003TXSF5C|4|Great book. One of the best attempt made explain the origin of the universe with out the need for \\"Creator\\" in the equation .
B000E5N62U|5|\\"This is my death album [...] it's about the death of culture, the death of politics, the beginning of the end of my life.'' -Donald Fagen (New York Times, Sunday, February 26, 2006)    Fagen spent an entire year working on \\"Morph the Cat\\" and you can really tell! The production on \\"Morph the Cat\\" is flawless, perfect, a thing of beauty; I've heard no better ever (I have roughly 2,000 compact discs and 30,000 MP3s) although you would certainly expect this from a man like Donald Fagen who can hear differences in the 1/10 of a decibel range (see; New York Times article cited above). Couple his absolute impeccable ear with the current technology and you get \\"Morph the Cat,\\" what I find to be the best produced studio album ever, even when measured against the entire Steely Dan, Donald Fagen, and Walter Becker catalogs, respectively. That aside...    Fagen, a known recluse has warmed up in recent years, occasionally touring (e.g. he is currently on his very first solo tour in support of \\"Morph\\"), giving an unprecedented number of interviews and surprisingly even subtle interpretations of the lyrical content contained within \\"Morph\\" (when asked in the past about his lyrics he often scoffed at the idea of providing interpretations).      The title track bookends the album, first introducing the listener to a feline named Morph who flies around Manhattan (I imagine the Chesire Cat from Alice in Wonderland) seemingly spreading good cheer. The album ends however on a completely different note (figuratively of course), when Morph seems then to reflect a menacing gaze (consistent with surveillance), a thematic panopticon of sorts (a panopticon is an architectural device initially used as a disciplinary mechanism in prisons but with modern surveillance technologies like the video camera has become an increasingly common component in our post 9-11 society - surveillance and 9/11 are both themes consistent throughout \\"Morph the Cat\\"). The theoretical premise of the panopticon of course concerns the idea that one can never discern whether they are being watched thus causing the survielled to self police themselves (see; Michel Foucault's Discipline and Punish).     \\"The cat is narcotizing the citizens [...] I observe it in people, this mind-death, these layers of brain-washing that's gone on for so many years. It's in the techniques of political machines, the unbelievable stupidity on television\\" -Donald Fagen (New York Times, Sunday, February 26, 2006).    \\"H Gang\\" is about an eccentric old band, the \\"life and death of a band in a nutshell,\\" Mr. Fagen writes in the album liner notes.     \\"What I Do\\" concerns an imaginarily conversation of a younger Mr. Fagen with the legendary Ray Charles. Here Mr. Fagen expresses his thoughts concerning his insecurities (hard to believe I know). Regarding the songs content, Mr. Fagen recently remarked, \\"I think I didn't accept myself as a performer until very recently. I always thought I had this sort of fake job\\" (WB/Reprise Records Press Release 2006).    \\"Brite Nitegown\\" is a song generally about death and dying. The fellow in the \\"brite nightgown\\" is none other than the Grim Reaper himself!     ''The Great Pagoda of Funn'' is seemingly about two lovers who remain together in an effort to shelter themselves from the horrors of the contemporary world. Mr. Fagen remarked that he, ''wrote that after several beheadings in Iraq, you can thank Mr. Zarqawi for that song'' (New York Times, Sunday, February 26, 2006).    \\"Security Joan\\" is playful song where a man falls for a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) guard at New York's LaGuardia Airport. The underlying tone of the song pokes fun at the ridiculousness of airport security.      \\"The Nite Belongs to Mona\\" contains the albums only direct reference to the Trade Towers in the line, \\"Was it the fire downtown/ that turned her world around?'' However the 9-11 attacks remain a theme consistent throughout the duration of the album.     \\"Mary Shut the Garden Door\\" is perhaps the most telling account of the tactics espoused by the current administration, what Mr. Fagen subtly likens to a \\"thuggish cult\\" (\\"Morph the Cat\\" liner notes 2006).       Overall this album is a real gem, surely not to disappoint! Do yourself a favor and purchase this album right away! I highly recommend this album as it is somewhat of a rarity (especially these days with the garbage that the music industry churns out) as it can be enjoyed on a variety of different levels by those of all ages, musicianship, intellectual capacity, etc.     The album is very pop oriented and \\"music friendly\\" (this DOES NOT imply elevator music) and the lyrical content for the most part is so subtle that you won't have to worry about your child, spouse, partner, pet, etc., becoming frightened to death! The production is so damn perfect that even the novice musical ear will take notice.     The album is perfect as either background music or for serious listening on both a musical level and/or lyrical level (I prefer the latter -this is the most stimulating album I've heard in years aside from Brian Wilson's SMiLE (2004). There is certainly a variety of ways to consume the music contained on \\"Morph the Cat\\" most albums (contemporary or otherwise), fail to ever achieve such a goal!     [NOTE: Later this year Reprise Records plans to release a three disc box set probably containing remixed versions of Donald Fagen's first two solo works, \\"The Nightfly\\" (1982) and \\"Kamakiriad\\" (1993), as well as his current release \\"Morph the Cat\\" (2006)]
B00IMYSCR4|3|Minimalist Review, Sans Spoilers:<br /><br />Spectacular special effects and solid, no-frills performances by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are undermined by an overly sentimental and by-the-book story.
0679890475|5|Very nice book
B00I8Q77Y0|4|I feel that the game is good but it is kinda distracting with the bird pooping. And I like floppy bird better.
B005544TRQ|4|It's really pretty good.  I like the comedy in it as well.
B005ZOBNOI|5|This book was woneful And is was beautiful I think there should be a second one but all things can't come true all thought I wish they could love your books jhon green write on
B0055PGUYU|4|The things I've learned from this book are already shaping my lifestyle. I am trying habit replacement and I'm creating healthy routines that I believe will help me improve my health and work ethic.<br /><br />This book has also taught me how many of my poor choices are influenced by marketing tricks from major companies, designed to fatten their pockets rather than benefit me. I have to be more circumspect about why I'm really opting to buy certain products.
B008UCJ7KO|5|As expected, this book was just as good, or better, than the previous two books!! For fans of the series, I'd definitely recommend it.
B00632HWOG|4|Works great
B00DMCV7K0|4|This is the story of a slave named Handful (Hetty) and her privileged owner's daughter, Sarah. It shows how Sarah's affection for Hetty bumps up against the injustice of Hetty being a slave. Sarah tries to free her but it is not alowed by her all controlling mother.<br />This book chronicles how difficult the life of a slave was. It also shows how Sarah grows up and becomes one of the foremost Abolitionists in the country. She forsakes marriage and comfort for her cause to speak against the inhumaneness of slavery.<br />A very good read.
B00632HWOG|3|I have two Yahoo accounts so Im logged into both of them on the app. it really sucks when it wont allow me to switch accounts so I can view my emails. it takes days for ot to allow me to switch accounts. the faster way for me to view the other account is to sign out of one to view the other and vice-versa. and sometimes it wont delete emails that were suppose to delete. other than those two problems its an ehh ok app I guess.
B00BSBUZPK|5|Excellent.  I gave it as a gift to an Eagles buff!
B008966SIU|4|I really liked this album. If you liked their last album Veckatimest you'll love this one. If is more music down the same vein. Buy it!
B005PK553C|5|The best horror story EVER...it always keeps you guessing and in the edge of your seat...can't wait to start season 2!
0425252868|5|My father was stationed in England, and was a radio operator on a B17. I found this book so enlightening.<br />After years of stories about the war, it was incredible to read these first person accounts.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in WWII.
B003B02O14|4|Good story all in all. The end was unexpected and made me quite angry actually but it was a good book overall.
0439023521|5|The Hunger Games is a very thrilling romance novel for people of all ages. This book starts a romance like no other when Katniss Everdeen and Petta Mellark are forced to come together and a battle for their district and their own life. Katniss never wanted anything to do with Peeta, all she wanted to do was take care of her family and hunt with her best friend Gale. Due to the harsh ruling of the country Panem, every year there have a huge televised event. It is called the hunger games. This event was created for a very disturbing reason. Due to the harsh ruling of Panem district 13 tried to overthrow the government. Due to their failure the whole district was blown to pieces. These games were created to remind the citizens of Panem to not try to overthrow them. In the games 24 competitors have to fight and kill each other until the last one is standing. Shockingly on the day of the reaping, out of thousands of little children Katniss's younger sister Prim gets chosen to be the female tribute from her district, district 12. Sadly the ages to be chosen for this event are 12-18 and Prim gets chosen on her first year. Katniss couldn't stand to see Prim go so she had to come up with a solution and fast! Katniss volunteered to take her place. Prim was so upset and had to be pried off of her by Gale.<br />  Due to this, now Katniss and other district 12 tribute Peeta Mellark head into the capitol for a life or death battle. They have to fight against 22 other tributes that have lots of strengths and they trained for this event there whole life.

Oh, did I forget to mention only one can survive?<br />  I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone! I know nobody would be disappointed in this book. Now I'm sure your dying to know what's going to happen next. I guess you're just going to have to buy the book! Don't forget, May the odds be ever in your favor!<br /><br />Created by: Noah Stokes
B00CL68QVQ|1|I cannot believe this won the awards that it won.  I found the storyline totally unbelievable.  The saving grace of this movie was Robert DeNiro as the father, otherwise skip the movie.
B007IXWKUK|4|Better than the first book. This one actually had some plot. Both characters seem to have problems, not just Christian.
