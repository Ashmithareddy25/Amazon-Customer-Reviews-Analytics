B00CJ5DWKO|5|Worth it's weight in gold.
B00MRWNHT0|5|Nice
B009KOBC9U|5|As advertised.

B000CIXMPA|5|Safe for another time
B006DA34VI|5|good
B000JK2D06|5|leaves a beautiful finish
B004ZF4NJA|5|Awesome product and very good quality
B005JU5VH8|5|These are Bosch, need I say more? Excellent quality, easy installation and full on clearance. Buy'em if you need a good heavy wiper that not only does its job but looks nice as well.
B00BM8IXNU|1|Look people its pink, so I installed it on my kids power wheels and not my subaru
B00IUWM59O|5|works great
B0038QMFH4|5|Exactly what my truck needed.
B00LLOHKNO|5|Make sure to aim right
B000CPCBF0|5|put in my 2008 Toyota x runner works great
B0081J0YRG|5|I was dreading the install, but other than placement decisions, it was really simple. I have extras left because I simply wanted a light glow to the bike. This is only 8 total strips, will probably add another to the front fork or frame, when I can find appropriate alignment to hit the wheel.
B001DBQDGU|1|did not fit :(
B00SH33SVU|5|Much brighter than stock.
B004O844EM|4|Looks good
B000C9G3D2|5|stops much smoohter with the new springs. the old ones were weak & the shoes were cocking & binding on the drum.
B004500M8G|5|Used this on my 2005 Saab 9-2X (read Saabaru) with 160k miles.  Noticed that the car was beginning to overheat so I performed an exhaust gas test on my coolant which tested positive for head gasket leak.  Subaru engines are notorious for head gasket failure.  I purchased this BlueDevil product based on reviews I read here and videos I watched on YouTube.<br /><br />I used this product exactly as the instructions said and was not too confident that it would work because after letting my engine run for the full 50 minutes after pouring in the bottle, the temperature was already creeping up towards the red. The next morning (8 hours later) my car overheated much quicker than it was previously (within 10 minutes), and I had to pull over on the highway to let it cool before limping back home.  I was cursing BlueDevil for making my car worse than it already was.  After letting the car sit for a week I decided to use it for a quick drive and watched the temp gauge like a hawk the entire time.  Surprisingly, It held steady at the normal temp.<br /><br />That was 2 weeks ago and I've been driving my car daily since without any issues, sometimes driving for more than an hour at a time. This weekend I'll be testing my coolant again to see if it still tests positive for exhaust gas and will post an update.  So far I can say it has been well worth the money I spent on it.  If it allows me another few months to drive my car, I'll be more than satisfied.
B0088V424S|4|I like this, but it is a gift for someone who will love it.
B003RZ3S4A|5|Looks great!  Colors holding up well in the hot Texas sun.
B00KTHU1QM|5|Came with instructions had both programed on my 2003 350z in less then 5 minutes work great. Do not seem to have the range factory ones did or it might be me.
B001THQP84|5|Perfect for hanging our lights off our camper awning
B0060ZB43G|5|Great horn upgrade for a Jeep Wrangler JK.  The only challenge was deciding where to install the 2nd horn.  I really like the sound.  It sounds more like a Jeep should sound rather than a sick goat.
B00EZ4BXH6|5|high quality
B003TSS4I0|5|I have been using these sockets for about a year now working on building a Jeep constantly. I have had no problems with them what so ever. Between these and my cordless impact. Life is good. The compact case also fits nicely in my shallow tool box drawer.
B000C9GO8G|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B000EDOT82|1|Do NOT stand up to heat.  (on a stove....immagine)<br />Cheap crap.
B00BYH6C1E|4|It's a tad short for my seats in my '94 Honda Accord, but it still does what it's meant to do. It fits very snug and doesn't move, it's also soft and even though my seats are light grey, it doesn't bother me that it's a different color.
B00AV1FZ2G|4|Good product delivery on time
B000C1LLPA|5|Direct replacement ('08 Tacoma Double Cab). No issues.
B008NQL00W|5|As described and left plenty of slack for wiring ease.
B008MWHIUI|1|Heads up. Doesn't have everything you need for it to work out of the box. No wire, no actuator, no button etc... I guess if you were replacing your auto horn it might be ok.
B00CAZENCE|5|Incredible better than the original and holds the charge on my Jump Box 100% better. Thanks Joe in Schertz Tx.
B000CPCC3Q|2|very thin gage wire!
B00P1N9OWG|4|Its a gud stuff...
B00825NB24|5|Lights up, works, and reads the voltage.  I have it monitoring a 12v battery and so far I have had zero issues.
B00FRHOLK6|1|Squeak right out of the box and continue to do so for many months. Leave trails of water in the middle of the windscreen. Worthless.
B003YM5376|5|I think these are of good value.  Greasable bolts by themselves will cost you as much so getting the shackles is an added bonus.  Quality is good and they haven't shown any signs of rusting.  The dog-leg isn't as acute as say Currie's but they do the job.  I run a set in the rear and I'm just using the bolts up front.  No complaints.
B001OZQEHI|5|Amazon Prime is GREAT & well worth the price!!
B002FRXVS4|5|AWESOME!!!
B00WOT3YM6|3|It's ok. Kind of noisy.  It's not very effective for just topping off your tires if they only need a pound or two.  The size is nice.
B00H5XFG9U|5|Fits my 2003 Yukon XL. Would buy again.
B00WNMKBEI|5|Fit like a glove. Just what I needed.
B00B8ZIQNE|5|It was so beautiful and looks just like the original on my car thank you so much!!!! &#60;3
B007S0H5DU|5|Excellent product.  It works without formaldehyde.  It works as well or better than those products that contain dangerous chemicals.  Easy to use.
B005BU9712|5|VERY Sweet !
B00FTDJ9FA|5|Currently used in my backup lights on my Tahoe....look great and nice and bright at night with the backup camera....
B002JFEETW|1|Said it was a Large size, it wasn't. The size is perfect for a child.
B007WEQP6U|4|Works perfectly to attach my seat saddle safely to the frame of my bicycle.
B0083H5JAS|5|easy to use (need a torque wrench). Blocked off my leaking rear AC and now at least I have cold air up front!
B000XQ5IN0|4|they are good for the money.
B00CEXK8ZS|5|Awesome look. Best price
B00D0XHGTC|5|Great item
B004VOVT6A|5|I have installed one and have had no issues since installation.  The only problem is that I should have bought two, one for the other motor, because this was an obvious age related degraded condition and now 6 weeks later the other original is not working.
B006P88QXO|4|Very nice.
B001FCC7BW|5|Good stuff. Sticks to most everything and seals well.
B007Z79UNY|5|Just ordered them yesterday but since Colt is too cheap to give any out (as I called them and asked and they were too tight @$$ed about giving any out) EVEN THOUGH I JUST GOT DONE BUYING THEIR COLT M4A1 SOCOM and spending a lot of money on a high dollar product my hopes are that these are larger than what Colt gives out.
B000KK6X1K|5|Same as new, only $50 cheaper than the Chevy dealer!
B000EDOTCS|1|Waste of time as there is not enough space to hang such a large item.
B00FPL0LV2|4|It works great
B00GWFBTYI|5|Thanks
B00SARRQ70|5|They are pretty good.
B00UEC87QS|4|Look great and protect the grille.  Climbing mountains in the 100 degree temps in AZ you need to watch your temp gauge.  I've had to back off my normal drive speeds, pushing up a mountain about 70-75.... The Phoenix flat areas works in the normal temp range without any problems.
B00N0HKP7I|5|It bolted right in and works well. I didn't have to modify, splice, or tweak anything. It was a good value as well.
B00EKS5FJO|5|stuff works great all you retarded chumps that say it does not work don't have a clue what your talking about. and this stuff works way better than goo gone. goo gone works if your just removing dip from small areas but if you have a lot to take off like I did this is way better and even though the bottle costs more. it takes it off way faster and you have to use not even a quarter of what you would have using the goo gone. so instead of having to buy multiple bottles of goo gone just get one bottle of dip dissolve it will make your life a whole lot easier.
B000HSAT2Y|5|I've been a loyal Dowco customer for 10 years and am pleased with this model for my 2015 R1200GS.  The XL provides plenty of space, protection and is easy to put on and off.  I like the Dowco warranty and will purchase again for my next bike.
B00F9LQ3RO|5|Fits great and easy install.
B003VASX0A|1|Did not fit.
B004QHGQA6|5|good
B0018OY742|5|Works as stated. Not the prettiest thing, but I have yet to have to tighten straps. Does not vibrate to any certain degree and gives you the visibility needed. Recommended for such a low price.
B0014HBJE4|4|Looks Great! Makes my legs sweat a bit when it's hot but bearable so it's okay.Could be better if it's &#34;fan cooled.
B000C2CAS6|1|NOT a toyota camry 98 gasket
B000E2CVIS|5|Great price for a high quality product. This is the top rated one for my dad's 1989 Honda Goldwing GL1500.
B00HLK77YO|5|Very good.
B000OKTCE6|5|Changing oil and filter in a timely manner is one of the best maintenance for long engine life. I think this filter is perfect for my 8.3 Cummings.
B00D69WE2Y|3|Purchased these useless sliders and what do you know they don't fit. I have a 2012 ninja 650 before buying i contacted them and asked if they would fit my year bike and was told yes by Daisy. The bolts that they provided me were the wrong thread size as you can see in the picture. Tried to screw one in and it started to mess up the threads on my bike I nearly had a heart attack. Needless to say what a waste of time and money.  Edit:  Shipper sent me the right bolts
B00ABYVTXM|4|Works exactly the way they said it would. Very pleased with this product.
B00V64XVJQ|5|Carb kit was shipped promptly, my machine is up and running again thanks. Very happy
B00H9S71LW|4|Great product. Do not need any other app unless you need to hear bells. Just one thing. The type in the graphs are too small.
B00SHW7LWS|1|Didn't work currently been dealing with the place it comes from to get a replacement.
B00J11DE3E|3|Like this product and easy to install. Drawback is it is not waterproof so if you do spill, it really doesn't protect your seat.
B00X6EVJMK|5|These are nice and easy to put on. I'm using the seat belt strap cushion also, however, I don't have a problem with my steering wheel so I haven't used that cover yet.  My cousin and I own the same model/year car and when he saw mine he like them. I sent him the page from amazon and now my cousin has the seat cover set too.  He ordered the 4pc & I ordered the 7pc. I no longer sit on a super hot leather seat that has been sitting in the  hot summer sun for hours.  What made these so extra nice is my seats are light gray and these were light gray perfect match.
B001W4257Y|2|They're more of a Dark Gray color. So they don't really match the black carpet of my car.
B00BSMV9YK|5|These look absolutely awesome on my Excursion!
B00IX69YXM|3|As with most after market, be prepared for surprises. Picture/instructions wasn't an exact match, tools shown, vs tools required didn't match, rear u-bolt were a bigger diameter than factory. Factory plates had to be drilled bigger. Good quality parts, just saying to be prepared for surprises......
B000UK0D0M|5|Dropped these in my 07 sportster, 1200C. Great improvement over the stock springs, for one there's very little front end dive when I get on the brakes, and it soaks up the bumps so much better than before. If you get these, you won't be disappointed. I paired these with a set of progressive 410's on the back and greatly improved the comfort and handling of my bike.<br />Install was a breeze, lifted the bike on my buddies lift, jacked the front end up just so the forks are off the ground, popped the fork cap nut off pulled the stock springs and washer out and dropped these in too easy.
B0001YIUZC|1|The product would not even pick up a one gallon bucket of paint.  I called the company and they were of zero help and did not seem to care whatsoever that it did not work.  I would not recommend this product.
B00F06GXZA|5|This is a good light bulbs with a good white clear color, Not sure how long it would last hopefully it dies while still under warranty coverage...
B00PT18QAQ|5|Great quality.
B003RWMI5S|5|Excellent product.  Exactly as described.  Will do business again. Thank you.
B013XSCHXI|5|I love this sturdy little decal. My family is huge into guns, in fact my dad and sister worked for an FFL and sold them. I gave it to my sister, and she couldn't help  but chuckle. It's going on her car today! Its bright colored, and easy to see and read. It seems pretty sturdy, like its not going to tear or weather easily!<br /><br />Sample provided
B00NZC81U6|5|great sticker, get lots of attention
B00S05MSRK|5|Perfect fit for my Forester!  I have been looking for a 40&#34; to 42&#34; length organizer and most of them were either too small or too big to fit in my SUV.<br />This was perfect fit for my vehicle and have already used it for carrying grocery.  Exactly what I was looking for!
B00HLO3O88|1|I just purchased replacements for my low beams and fog lights. Had to buy replacement bulbs for the fog lights due to a broken lens but when I got the new low beams they were different colors and and neither of them were the 5000k color temp I ordered. One is purplish in color and the other is yellow.
B007T13834|5|a perfect addition to the clear headlights and parking lights and billet grille i bought to restore my 98 gmc
B008WXL0UQ|3|looks nice but was a pain in the butt to put on my car
B00Q4FMZNU|1|I have a 2002 f-250 7.3 turbo deisel. This sensor DID NOT WORK.
B00TEF4ZZI|5|These decals are very high quality and easy to place.
B00FYX21SM|4|Purchased for a 2012 Nissan Xterra. Easy to cut to fit. Doesn't cover the entire trunk area in the Xterra, but does provide plenty of room for non-slip storage. Might not feel sticky enough when you first put it in, but once the inside of your car warms up it will be obvious.
B000EDQQHO|5|Great product. Cleaned my roof up nice.
B00KTHU9MI|1|This key Fob lasted less than six months
B00K0TAEPW|5|Fit 2015 Toyota Tundra perfectly, does the job its suppose to, keeping the mud off the carpet. Easy to clean.
B000I2079E|5|I first got a can of this catalyst from an auto mechanic when I was attempting to take a seat out of a car to replace the motor that moves the seat.  I've used it numerous times since to loosen nuts and bolts and valves which are frozen from years of inactivity (including in cars and things like water valves in bathrooms).  I find that if I spray it on, and then walk away for a few minutes, the PB Blaster will work its magic and the thing can be persuaded to move again.  It's a must for fans of older cars and older houses!
B00062YCWY|5|Works Great
B00KTLZPS2|5|For the money lots of fun. Brings back childhood memories.
B001O7PNNM|4|works as advertised
B00YFR875O|5|I received this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.  My opinions are my own.<br />First off, these signs are for the emergency services to be alerted to children inside the vehicle involved in an accident or emergency situation.  I know people joke about people deciding to hit cars that don't have these signs on them.  But the sign isn't necessarily for other drivers to watch out for me and my child in the car.  But it is nice when they hold off being stunt drivers around us.<br />It is magnetic and sticks to the side of the car, rather than the bumper.  The bumper is plastic, which I didn't really think about before.  But it holds tight to the car.  It's a strong magnet.  I was worried that it would slide off or get swiped, but it is still on my car and exactly where I put it.  It is reflective and is easily visible to anyone, whether they are looking for it or not.  It sticks out.  It is visible from a distance and easy to read, too.  Most people recognize what it is anyways, since these have been around for a while.  But specifically for this product, it works, it sticks tight to my car, and it sends the message it needs to.  If an accident happens, my child will be one of the first the emergency crew looks for.
B00QODPG74|1|Cheap hardware crappy tape holding them on to fork tubes
B002PZA2UG|4|I was pleasantly surprised. I'd gone thru all these reviews before purchasing and the one complaint I agree with is that things come out a little wrinkled. Improved by decreasing the load size and taking items out as soon as it's done. Also helps not washing jeans with towels...too bulky. For its size it can wash quite a bit and it takes a little experimenting to find the right load size/wash/dry time sequence.<br />It has been super convenient though. Throw in a load and forget about it.
B00877TP4K|5|If you have a first gen tundra, youve got broken latches on the back windows if they have been used at all. This is a one and done fix. Took about 20 minutes to do both sides, and now they are bullet proof. Simple, effective, fixed! Toyota should have made them like this in the first place.
B00BC372EG|5|Perfect! Low profile, comfortable fit and simply bad ass....every time I'm out someone asks where I got it. You do get some lift over 60mph but that's to be expected with this style. Highly recommend this helmet if you are looking for this style.
B003L5HS74|4|So far everything has been good. The company did a great job
B009DIWO2M|5|Great product
B00123J79O|2|A useful product but very flimsy.<br /><br />The wiring in the alligator clips is super flimsy (cat 5) and after a couple of years of just sitting in the box, all of them started to malfunction, so I had to order another set of alligator clips/microphones.<br /><br />The wires could not possible be thinner and the RCA plug is plastic covered in metal film and the tip will break with the slightest pressure. Plus the RCA plug is too big and easy to bend when your securing the transmitters.<br /><br />Also, its more annoying to set up than you'd think because the alligator clips are large as are the transmitters. Because you have to secure each transmitter and make sure its not going to touch any rotating or moving parts or fall off while driving, the size of these clips and transmitter become problematic. I understand the clips need to grasp metal parts but the transmitters at least could be half that size.
B00L4H13HC|1|not good. I have a 99 Acura TL sedan. The electronics do fit inside this casing, but the panic button sticks up and tends to go off. If you lay the assembled unit flat on the table and don't touch it, it's all right. But once in a pocket or handbag, the panic button will sound. Also, it's spelled PAN1C. WHY? WHY? Why can't it be spelled PANIC and why can't it work decently? I'd be less peeved about it if it only cost me a dollar. Why does everything have to be made so poorly nowadays? Even THIS, which should be so simple, is made like garbage.
B006T1YH1W|5|This throttle controller works great! I have it in my 2012 Honda Accord I4, and it really makes the car feel more spirited and peppy. It eliminates almost all acceleration lag - the transmission now downshifts right away when pressing on the gas.
B00FX3YCX0|3|These a just LED's, and they do not have the third wire required for them to be turn indicators, just two wires sticking out of the back (hot and ground). I like these lights though. I might buy another set so that I don't have to splice my turn signal with my running lights.<br /><br />Pros: very bright, easy to mount, and pretty subtle<br />Cons: very thin wires, hard to make connections with said wires, weak weather proof seal from housing to wires
B000NJ1HIW|5|Great Vest Real Comfortable and Well Made
B00DP754GU|5|Not for me. Heard they are nice and easy to install
B00Y5N6XJA|2|Got it on time and well built but it doesn't fit my '03 zx12r. The price was right. I'll see if someone else can use it.
B00UNMWGNO|5|this spokes works for a Honda Shadow ACE ? is a 15&#34; rims.
B007WWVWQ0|5|Very nice, good looking and lots of tube.  I did some polishing on the inside of the parts, but that seporates the good from the regular.
B000N9VF6Q|5|Replaced this item in our camper and it's working great along with new water pump ordered at the same time.  Order arrived on time and helped us complete the project.
B001COAS78|5|Perfect. Works the way it was supposed to .
B0036XGKDY|5|Worked perfectly love how fast my truck can build air with these had a single one before lasted a really long time
B001HUEJD6|5|Very cool, using in my old Jeep for the trailer brake.
B003K29SOO|1|Did not fit, said it would but didnt
B00RVCFNCK|5|These will work well with my current projects.
B009TB9UPW|4|Its ok I like it
B000S2QM8Y|5|Fantastic! This fixed my problem and was shipped and delivered quickly.
B0081OSRQQ|5|On time. Worked perfectly.
B000FQ01TE|5|looks good on the boat, nice to know how much gas you have
B00QHZV7IQ|3|We like the concept and the price, and it works but sometimes the image freezes for a second.  if you are very close to your target when this happens, you could hit it.
B004D5Q3IQ|2|Missing rubber gasket.
B00E9BQAQ4|5|great sticker
B004R33MYW|5|Jack extremely well constructed and exceeded my expectations.  Easy to install
B007N3I4QY|4|typical
B0055DQ2RC|4|wonderful
B0013FMW84|4|I used it on my Duramax didn't see any difference in my balance rates
B00BGS3JMQ|4|Works well, and the color even had the little sparkles in it. The color match was not perfect, however. I suspect that this is due to my cas's original paint fading over time. Wax helps blend it visually, and you only see it if you really lookb but a large painted patch would probably be obvious.
B009DJU8P6|1|Installed easily enough, worked for about two months, then failed. Would not purchase again.
B0009IK4QS|4|Could not find refills locally, this did the trick.
B0108U7XVA|5|These Replacement bulb (Cold white) by briteNway are amazing. briteNway is a great company. I love the fact that their bulbs are very safe and there is no UV or mercury exposure within any of  briteNway crafted LED lighting products and they are green and environment-friendly products,. I love the fact that the box comes with 10 bulbs. I change all the interior lighting of my car with these great LED bulbs and also one tail light. I love the fact that the light is really bright and really white. These should be the only lights i ever need to install in my vehicle since they have a really long life. Each bulb features an 18 count LED influx for maximum light emission which creates a 360 viewing angle. They take less electric power and the light is 300% brighter than traditional bulbs. The LED bulbs are built with such superior technology and quality manufacturing that the company offer lifetime money back guarantee. So there is noting to lose, you can buy with confidence.<br /><br />Now for packaging and shipping: The bulbs were packed in a box. The box contain a zip lock bag which had 10 LED bulbs, plus there is maual and a life time guarantee card. The shipping was also very fast. I got these LED's in two days after placing the order. I bough them at a discounted price for testing and unbiased review. I am very happy with my purchase. I highly recommend these 10 pack  Replacement bulb from briteNway. Below are few pictures of the bulb that i took when i first received them.
B00HRIHYOS|1|I first time I used it the hose came out the end fitting. so I returned it.
B002PUR768|4|It's a good mat. Not very happy that it isn't described as a single floor mat. Had to make a second purchase
B00TEA5PZC|5|Surpassed my expectations.  High quality, easy installation and the price was nice.
B00GE8QK3I|5|Worked fine in 2004 Nissan Titan.
B004AIHKT2|2|The parts does functionally work so far, but I paid for a Dorman 924-706 METAL part on purpose, since the original Chrysler part had failed due to a design problem!!!<br /><br />Instead I got another Chrysler PLASTIC part.<br /><br />I did not get what was advertised and I did not get what I paid for!!!!
B00JJ3R8RC|5|It's on my car.
B000B8U61O|5|Good Product.
B001C6JCMI|5|I wish I had known that this was the problem a year ago and I would have repaired it then.  Worked perfectly and easy to do.
B008LLVAS6|4|Shipped quickly. Product is not as sturdy as I expected.
B0016OIGTQ|3|These are the front for a 2011 CR-V. The edges don't really conform well. Also I originally thought they were one piece as the back are. The back set is great ***** five stars. The front set are just OK. The door edges kind of sag and are ugly.
B00RV417XM|4|The one that worked looks great. One arrived damaged. When you shake it it sounds like a rattle inside and doesn't work. Makes my car look a little goofy and I will have to order new ones. It's not worth the time or hassle to me to go through the returns process, so I'm just taking the loss. I will say the one that does work looks great, though! I'd happily take a replacement. Giving it four stars only because of the one that didn't work, but I can't deduct too much because it was most likely damaged during shipping. At this point I haven't decided if I'm using the same vendor or not for the replacements, but again, I don't blame Amazon or the JDM ASTAR.
B005PB4OJC|5|My husband says it fits perfectly.
B000IYBEOE|5|I Have a 1993 Civic JDM with a B16A engine, and the NGK 8018 Cables were a perfect fit.They will work with any B16A/B16B/B17A/B18C engine.
B000C7RZEK|5|I purchased 2 of these to use as radiators for a project of mine. I put a CBR600f4i engine in my four wheeler, and rigged these up as the 2 radiators on the front of the four wheeler. So far they seem to be keeping the engine plenty cool!<br /><br />These don't have radiator caps, so if you're going to use them for a project like i did, make sure that you get a radiator coolant reservoir that has a pressurized cap, and keep the reservoir above the top of the engine, so gravity will keep the coolant in the engine.
B00GUBZYUY|5|Perfect fit!
B004LF1U5O|5|Motul for life!
B010QBCZ1O|5|Super easy to install! The brightest headlight I have ever had!
B000C5G88Q|5|👍
B00PYD27W2|4|They fit nice 2012 Mazda 3
B00RJKB2FQ|4|received quick and is what is advertized
B00753S8CC|4|Great design, good vinyl, large size. This thing looks great among my ever-growing collection of white vinyl stickers.
B003IHKXKY|4|received quick and is what is advertized, fit my trailer tongue perfectly
B00EI6CKVE|5|Great conversation starter
B004O4ZPQW|4|Seems to be a God starter.
B00QFEJVG4|3|Good overall, hoks are abit small and hard to attach to existing anchors
B000BQSIWK|4|It isn't a quick charger, it's not totally silent when the fan turns on, but it works. I charged the battery in my old pickup when it's alternator died.
B00XXO19XC|5|THIS IS VERY HIGH QUALITY! A MUST FOR ANY V OWNER
B00WW0BDPC|4|Have had them for close to a month now and have had no issues thus far. A solid product in my opinion.
B007T9ZVIQ|5|Awesome product, just as described. They even arrived early. They will work perfectly for both of my trailers even though they have different size hitches.
B0009PCPNQ|4|This product worked very well on my Cadillac light tan carpets.  After a few years I had some dirt and coffee marks on the carpets that I did not think would ever come out but with the aid of an electric drill and soft bristle drill attachment all of the marks came out and it looks as good as any detailing job could have done and the price of this product is also very good.
B000M61J9I|5|A great, low price for a large variety of springs. This assortment provides springs for a lot of the jobs that I perform (pinball and arcade machines) but can also be helpful for other mechanical needs. Never hurts to have plenty of spare springs!
B001GMX9C2|3|I returned it for a different model
B00YE5Q0Q0|5|This battery pack performs well at all the things you'd expect it to- powering USB devices and the A/C devices that fit its selection of connectors. It's well-designed, lightweight, and easy to configure and use.<br /><br />The value, however, is in its car-jumping functionality, and I've had the opportunity to test this twice on a 2003 Mach 1 Mustang- a fairly powerful (315 HP) V8 engine that requires a good bit of power. In one case, the battery had drained due to lights being left on accidentally, and in the other, it drained because it just needs to be replaced.<br /><br />In both instances, the DBPOWER pack jumped the car without any difficulty, and I was quite impressed to see that the battery pack still had 75% power after charging in both cases. Though one should always charge a battery pack after a jump-off, the fact that there was still so much juice in the pack indicates that its capacity is sufficient for a variety of vehicles, large and small.<br /><br />Only time will tell how well it holds charges after multiple uses, but so far, I'm totally happy ,both with its versatility and its performance. It comes with all the accessories needed and is packaged in a compact case that makes access and storage very easy.<br /><br />This comes highly recommended.<br /><br />FULL DISCLOSURE: I was provided with a review unit of this item.
B0062DMPDO|5|My car seems to like it. 2000 Nissan Sentra used for a delivery job.
B000CMH8UG|5|Just as described with a blue shade.  Makes my black wagon look like a panel truck but has good visibility for outside.
B00YQBBCEW|1|Didn't fit the seats.  Had to put new elastic on it to go around the back,
B0031HEIDY|5|Product as described and met my needs
B0007DGG58|5|Fast and works great
B003W5NWKA|5|Works like a charm!
B00B75Y8PK|2|didn't like color and the headrest had to be reordered cause they didn't fit. But Iggee company did make it right
B001G8QX5G|1|These mount insert are trash, I have never seen a worse design. They didn't fit in the stock mount or the aftermarket mount. You know what they fit? The trash can.<br /><br />I installed a whole car Energy Suspension kit, everything but these.<br /><br />This is what you do. Buy a brand new torque arm for 20 bucks, get a $6 tube of polyurethane sealant for a caulk gun and fill all the voids in the rubber ends with the sealant, let it dry for about a week, install. It works perfectly.
B003D3TKNY|5|After years of hanging garbage bags from trees or propping them up against shade canopies I decided it was finally time to invest in tidying up my campsite. This particular item was fantastic. I found that several of my friends from adjacent campsites would walk over to discard their empty bottles and cans simply because there was a specific receptacle to do so. It also made packing up a lot easier. It was strong enough to load onto my friend's jeep to take to the campground dump/recycling center when we were leaving.<br /><br />For our purposes it was the perfect size. Held bottles and cans from several evenings of drinks by the fire. It can be staked down on both sides through attached loops. Kept it securely in place during a strong bout of wind and rain that passed through the area. Zips closed to help keep the rain (and any curious passing critters) out.<br /><br />Handles and compactibility make it nice and portable. Dividers are sewn in, making it impossible to use a larger trash bag for co-mingled recyclables. Material allows for the container to be rinsed down when you're done. I'm sure this could spring some holes over time if a raccoon, mouse, or other dedicated creature takes interest in what's inside of it, or there's broken glass, sharp metal, etc. That aside, I see this lasting a number of years and am very happy with the purchase for my campsite.
B00GZR4N0K|5|Perfect! Easy installation for me
B00D7QHSKY|5|LOOKS GREAT ON MY 2003 BMW 325I, SUPER EASY TO INSTALL AND FIT WELL WITH THE ROOF... LOOKS REALLY GREAT AND ADDS A NICE SPORTY LOOK TO THE CAR NOW

B001RBCU90|5|I love this! Sticks like a sticker, not like a cling. Survives car washes.
B00NWT4QLA|5|Surprise--Surprise!! They had and identical replacement at a very reasonable price. The delivery was quicker than I expected. Very pleased.
B00032K50U|1|These are terrible.  They are too small for my license plate frame and are made from weak plastic. I should have listened to the reviews.
B011JNP9Z2|2|too small
B00HB9KX82|5|Perfect!!! Fits perfect, Looks perfect. Installs perfect.
B00O0YZVKQ|1|did not match oem paint at all.
B00YR3YMPU|5|Great mirrors! I went to YouTube and found a video to help with installation. They do shake a bit but I'm used to it now. Great look for my 2013 Silverado.
B008K6I1RU|5|Much better than the one we had.  Husband installed in no time at all. We sold the other. This is taller and a little heavier build, seems to flush better and just presents as an all round sturdier, taller product.
B000BVRZ74|5|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wTF8Vw7rk8<br /><br />use it like he dose in this movie
B0002M9QJM|1|Description claims DOT approved but the box that arrived said it does not meet any federal standard.
B00NANGQM0|5|It's large and looks fantastic.  Be careful with applying the sword,  I messed it up a little but it was my fault.
B007Q683U0|5|Luv this product love to represent my born land mon very fast shipping and reasonable price<br />*RuDe BoY J'maica*
B001JT1IWU|5|Ok
B0083LIKU0|5|Easy to keep clean, fits in carrying case with room for stakes, matches the colors of our camper. A must have to gel keep dirt outside where it belongs, then hose it off and let it dry.
B001UGPEEA|5|Installation wasn't difficult and dramatically reduces movement.  The instructions were very clear and easy to follow.
B002J7VX4Y|5|Great!
B00PKREK90|5|Yeeeeeeeeeeehaaaaaaaaaaaw!!! Buy this fer yer truck.
B0041DZYJO|5|Worked perfectly!!! Thank you!
B00FPL2D2C|5|Works like champion
B00LP4MATO|5|Super Bright, My truck has dark tinted windows and I live out in the country. So if was difficult to see when I would back up. I mounted these under the rear of my truck on the hitch. They put out a crazy amount of light for the how much they are charging.
B004OVBWLM|3|what really made me purchase this particular intake besides the awesome reviews I read about it in online forums was the really nice polished aluminum shown in the pictures and noted in the description. Upon receiving the intake I instantly relized what they had shipped me was not the same as the photo or description and is anodized(painted) aluminum and not actual polished aluminum. I really feel like they got me with the good ole bait and switch. I put it on my car anyways and it sounds great and runs just like the reviews said it would, but I really wish they shipped me what they lead me to believe I was getting. (Polished aluminum) not painted aluminum.
B0064VJ41U|5|great product thumbs up
B00GDV3EJ4|4|Would have given 5 stars as it is a quality item. Description says will fit 2008 + Club Car. I have a 2016, does not fit. Had to get out the Dremel. With a small grinding / easy modification on the passenger side center it will fit. Looks great.
B001OMPJHM|1|Originally was very pleased by the Headlights....installed perfectly with ease as advertised on my 1991 Mazda b2200 but after a long wait for them to arrive (2+ Months!!) and only using them for less than 2 months, the glass in the passenger side headlamp has already cracked. I cannot tell if it was from heat or from a rock but these class lenses will crack! Like I said was very happy with them except for durability. I would like to speak to the company about this
B000C546I0|5|Fit Perfect  with my nissan 240sx
B00AETUVM4|5|Very long and easily reaches the length of my Suburban. Surprisingly heavy duty cables.
B00HFL30Y0|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B0015RG04W|5|I got the size wrong on inlet and outlet but, it was hard to see where the description was on this item to order.  I'll use it for something later, I'm sure.  I am on a farm.
B00CTG4YIW|5|As advertised.
B005DUN42I|5|takes away some of the vibration.
B00HJ6O4A0|2|Just more Chinese made crap. It has a heavy chemical smell to it. The &#34;Made in China&#34; smell is what I like to call it. Also, it is difficult to fold back up once unfolded. I may return this if we find the tags that came with it. Save yourself the money and just bring an old sheet to the beach to lay on.
B001KQF6PC|5|Needed a new vacation pump for my powerstroke. ...my old one ran all the time...installed this one and it produced vacuum in 5 seconds...and stays off....plus it's pulling the  vent door wide open and I can feel a huge difference in the volume of air moving through vent....was a little apprehensive about made in China but the way this is working , I have no right to complain. ...
B0013UBC7Q|5|Inexpensive, sounds fantastic, great muffler. It only really growls on acceleration, so its not obnoxious, but sounds touh when you stomp in it. Im sure it may help mileage, but I love the sound so much I cant keep my foot out of it.
B00C7Y8NFG|5|Affordable and works great....like I said above ;-)
B00UNTU3VO|5|Just got it and have only used it once on my new black on black car.  First impression is that it feels like quality and I was able to remove all the dust both interior and exterior easily.  Am very pleased and think I made a very good choice.
B00ZFQO820|5|great
B00MOUBRSI|5|great
B0091XPJ4O|1|Terrible! It ruined the paint on my car when I tried taking this thing off.
B009QE1V0Y|5|My husband bought this key chain for our daughter and we all just LUV it! The online photos can't do it justice; so pretty and well constructed!!!
B00097FDGA|1|It is not white
B001KO7170|5|This snapped on tightly over the horn of my 2012 Yamaha V Star 950 Tourer.  Adds a little bling and looks great.
B004T5X1EE|5|Was perfect match with the original  100%satisfaction
B000BN85SK|3|returned, no longer had car
B001RKH7FS|5|Good product. Very useful.
B00QFEJVG4|4|Very useful product and fits very well in a 2016 Subaru Forester.<br /><br />Received 4 stars for flimsy-feeling plastic clips that clip to the car's cargo tie-downs, but they haven't broken yet.
B0082JZYI4|5|Great price.  Bought another.
B00SBZRKEU|5|I just got this and it works great would recommend
B00E6A7E0E|5|stones
B00CHEWFAU|5|I've been using these a week now and I love them. They fit perfectly in my 2016 Santa Fe. In the back seat I decided to remove the car mats that came with my car in order to use the hooks with the new mat. The mat is shipped folded up so the hooks help it conform better to the floor in the back. I did not remove the floor mats in the front seats though, I just put these mats on top and it works perfectly and hasn't slid around at all.<br /><br />I am so thrilled with these. They look like they are part of the floor of the car, that's how well they blend in. You don't even notice them.
B001CMD8OU|5|Great decal! Thanks!
B00KCWNOEK|3|worked great for the first 6 months or so.  The wires are kinda cheesy and not really meant for wheeling use.  the switch quit after about 6 months and we wired it direct so you cant choose your color.
B00KTJ7IGQ|5|Literally took me all of a minute to program it with my radio works great very happy and inexpensive as well
B00IS95OOC|4|Very easy installation. Looks great.
B000L9AD2K|5|very good!
B001NOV9KC|5|It's so soft. I love it .
B003G9IP90|5|Works perfectly. Easy to install. Inexpensive.
B00MMLIXPO|4|Very good
B00NPY02KG|5|I've have a $36.00 Cen-tec DMM from Harbour Freight.  I should have upgraded waaaaaaayyyyyy sooner! I only paid $55.00 for this Power Probe DMM but it has a lot of features that my co-workers Fluke has with a great level of accuracy! TRMS, DC Amps, removable alligator clips, 5 ft leads are just a few of the multitude of features that I use. This DMM is freaking awesome!
B00684TAYY|5|It met expectations
B00S5ANUPO|5|Great product fits very well with my truck very fast shipping and the price was amazingly satisfactory<br />*RuDe BoY J'maica*
B005RZB0YS|5|My first impressions of these auto lamps from Eagle Eye are wow these headlamps look amazing. They arrive earlier the expected which is great I just received them today August 27, 2015 I was supposed to see receive them August 28th-September 2. My original headlights were looked great until I started getting my truck washed at an automatic car wash. After few months my lights had scratches on them and they start to yellow and fade. So my advice to anyone is to stay away from the automatic car washes the dirt left on the spinning brushes will get on your car's paint and damage it or your headlight I have a 2006 Toyota rav4 sport. These lights are the full headlight assembly flights aren't included. I'm going to show a before picture of my original headlights. I will be doing the update once I install my new headlights to show you how they look.
B00K7YI33U|5|Bag works great on our '09 Spyder RS.  Very handy and nice size.
B007WMGRII|4|The product is as it's explain, unfortunately I found out I didn't need this part so I had to return it.
B007772HG4|5|Great for hooking up your trailer when you have no one to help you. It works great!
B0015DMKCM|2|we dont use this jack that often and after 1.5 years its leaking fluid from the cylinder. we probably have used it less than 30 times and never had more than 200 lbs on it. Disappointing
B0052XNOIA|5|Fits my 2012 Honda Odyssey EX perfectly. Looked in the stores near me first, bigger brand names, nothing fit. Did some research and heard this was the best. Well, it is! Fits perfect.
B0016HZZ0Q|5|Worked great.
B00HNW8MJ4|5|I love it!<br /><br />Fits right Prius 2009 and doesn't slip.<br /><br />Been using it for over a year now - Nothing to add - just perfect
B000BQP2TW|2|Bought these even after reading the reviews about the smell thinking maybe other people have a low tolerance for these things, but no, these are the grossest smelling items I've ever had..The quality and heft are really nice, but I don't think I can actually use them much longer. I have tried to give them a chance to air out but my car stills smells like a garbage pit, absolutely horrible..
B0041TQS5M|4|Easy to install, works well.
B000630IYO|1|Does not work as advertised ,customer  service was horrible
B001TNMWBM|4|I thought this spray paint was good quality. I liked it more then Rust Oleum brand.  It dries clear, but you must have the right touch when spraying the thin coats or it will come out a little cloudy. The spray tip is adjustable for vertical and horizontal spray, which I also liked. Definitely recommend to anyone who is trying to protect plastic items or previous coats of paint.  Also keep in mind not to spray this if it is very humid outside as it will not properly adhere to the surface you are trying to coat.
B002WFBA0A|4|I like it.  It is a bit heavy but made well.  Can't beat it for the price.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Super bright for such a small light.. Very affordable.. Great shipping
B00AZ4PK1K|5|THEY FIT PERFECTLY ON MY 2003 BMW 325I.... I HAVE BEEN THROUGH SEVERAL CAR WASHES WITH THEM AND THEY STILL ARE ON THERE SOLID. HIGHLY RECOMMEND, INSTALLATION WAS A BREEZE
B008R5LI56|5|The reason I bought this CB Speaker was to use it with my speed radar Beltronics RX65, as I find it to be not loud. I like to use my music loud and what's the point of owning a speed radar if I cannot listen my music as I wanted. This little speaker does a great job, enough for me to be loud.<br /><br />Its cable is long enough to be in the center of the dash. under the radio compartment, and routed trough the back of the dash, right post and to the speed radar.
B00TVWFONQ|2|I had to return one set because one of the bulbs had a Amber part not lighting. Of course Amazon was quick to pick up and refund. Both other sets are still working great. One note to potential buyers: These bulbs have &#34;Bright Cool White&#34; look to them. Meaning, when my headlights are on these things are brighter than my Silverstar H4s. The Amber is awesome, but I was hoping the white was more of a white than blueish tinge. Not a huge deal breaking. I just now HAVE TO upgrade to HID or LED headlights. 😎<br />Overall these bulbs are great the second time around.<br />SCRATCH THAT!! I've now had another bulb go completely out. I've bought other bulbs from this company without issue. These bulbs are not reliable! Plus, they are just too blue for my taste.
B001FAIBDW|5|Amazing value for these sure step style nerf bars.  I used these to replace a pair of black Smittybilts that had rotted out from rust.  These use the same mounting design as Smittys and the brackets are more stout. No drilling required. They are well designed as they hug the body better without being too low to the ground.  Be sure you have a good breaker bar to remove the body bolts on the vehicle. 21mm hex bolt on body of vehicle and 3/4&#34; hex bolt on ends of tubes.  Included hardware is top notch but I had to re-use the body bolts that came on vehicle. Nice price for stainless bars.
B000FW2MWW|5|good
B00KVVBEWQ|2|I've never really found the need for a standalone GPS unit since every smartphone on the market has at least one app that's really reliable. But I thought that I'd give a Magellan a try since I had a road trip coming up and since I hate driving on the expressways, I was hoping for something that would not only give a nice big screen but would also give good alternatives and secondary roads.<br /><br />Not only did this not do anything better than my Galaxy Tab 4, it did most things worse.<br /><br />Sure, having a huge 7-inch screen is really cool but it starts to wear on your eyes when driving at night. All of the other features were things that were present in a dozen other apps that my phone has, and it's far more reliable.<br /><br />Really, unless you need this size and you don't own a smartphone, I would still recommend something else.
B0049IKSJM|5|works well on my mc
B005XRQHKW|4|have not put them in yet well let you know later but i like the way they look
B00K9UGBPO|5|Fast shipping. Went on great
B00065WNK4|5|Almost looks like the factory installed it. Seems are nice and tight, no movement on the cover once stitched up, so make sure the seem is exactly where you want it. Waxed thread that it comes has plenty of extra length, ands stays tight when pulled
B0042VTYV4|5|This is my second purchase, and although I can't say to the effectiveness of this device (and I hope I will never have to), I have tested the window breaker mechanism and it is VERY painful. Make sure you test it out on a piece of wood if you have to, and not your hands (silly me!).<br /><br />For some reason the window breaker does not reset correctly sometimes. To do a manual reset you would have to find a thin metal rod (like a screwdriver) and push the pin all the way back in until it clicks. This could be a concern as the tip of the breaker may become blunt, and if it fails to reset should you find yourself unsuccessful at breaking a window when you need to, good luck!<br /><br />The knife edge is very sharp and I sometimes use it as a letter opener.
B00AKFB662|4|It's okay, kind of heavy though
B00GD3XCMQ|5|This is a real good way to save some money by rebuilding your pump instead of buying a new one. Has all of the parts you need plus a good set of directions on how to use them. Didn't take long to rebuild my pump and it works like new. Was also shipped out on time and arrived on time.
B000K9VXM0|5|Fantastic Item and very sturdy! Thanks!
B0143JK57G|3|Hard to rate. It looks like some of your products are missing the &#34;w&#34; in win. Otherwise I would be purchasing.
B00TON56M6|5|Like it very much, it was just like shown.  Delivered in timely fashion.
B000GTXZHU|5|Every thing packaged correct received promptly... watched you tube video of installation... worst part was getting old bearings out... be careful putting new ones in make sure they start square, we had to knock first one back out to start over... after they are 1/3 or so in they are ok finish knocking in until they bottom out...
B006NTK3MM|5|Great idea with the removable end, made running wires really easy.
B0031R61DO|5|Super yellow, looks great on my E92 335i
B000FQ1T7W|4|This fit my '03 Wrangler TJ as advertised and installation was the same as the OEM pump. The gasket that came in the box was cardboard with no silicone bead like the OEM or a Fel-Pro, but I put a thin layer of blue RTV on the water pump side and it sealed up tight. I give 4 stars because the overall quality when compared side by side with the OEM pump is just not as good; the machining is rough and there were a few burrs and a little chunk missing from the tip of a couple impeller vanes that will degrade performance slightly...but that being said it circulates coolant and keeps my temps in the same range as the original pump for half the price, so I am satisfied. Mine has been running for a month with no issues, but the dubious machining quality makes me suspect that it will not last 10+ years like the original.
B00IBG2C9W|4|they worked on my sv650s but not too bright
B00I8J0BPO|5|very good
B000FQ1JKE|4|nice price for our jeep
B00JX70NOY|1|Took a while to receive and was not right for my cycle. Have returned it - hopefully will refund as it was costly to send back.
B00EHKS1Z0|5|I just received Andys Super Oil , I have used it both at home and work and am very impressed by the product.
B00XF6R464|4|works as advertised but clips didn't match up perfectly... required electrical tape to hold together.
B001JT5TQQ|3|I bought two: One for my 2006 Accord and it works great. Bought another one for my son for his Toyota and it registers the same direction all of the time. I have to wonder if there is more magnetic force in his car.
B0031HEIDY|5|Now other drivers hate me cuz they're lights suck
B005I02QJK|5|Great product
B000CQDRP2|4|Good disconnect for RV battery
B0076PKI4U|5|As described, arrived promptly
B00AQ38I8C|1|This item is NOT for a 2001 Civic as posted
B008G2306U|4|Look great and have been clear for 3 months now. Easy to break some of the tabs off. Be careful.
B001OMLEFI|5|Perfect fit!
B0031HXZB0|1|Just a note
B00121BPI2|5|To apply 5 Star Shine Paint Protection to my car wasn't as bad as I expected.  It took me 2 hours from start to finish.  I am very satisfied with the shine and protection I get from 5 Star Shine.
B00Z8MH6SY|5|was what I needed.
B0043VX69E|5|Good
B005P5DNAO|5|works well,  sturdy enough- about 6 feet tall and 185 lb,  not an easy install, but not difficult.
B000AY4NQS|5|Nice plate, cant wait to put my EDL letters on it!<br />Support the EDL!
B003ZWZ7VM|5|Excellent. Worked perfectly.
B000C48X8U|3|The rear hose connection was not a solid piece of the reservoir like it should have been.  Instead it was an insert that leaked from day 1.  I had to swap the reservoir from my old pump onto this one.
B0031BJO2U|4|great plug, but a little pricey.
B00S1RF35G|5|Fixed my problem and fit like it's suppose to!!!
B0085ME6R8|5|Great product.
B000FJQWYO|5|haven't installed the gauges yet but they look nice
B001GRMC5W|5|Fits like a glove.... truly custom designed for my application (2013 C250 sedan).
B00GHHHHLA|5|Good product!
B002M589TA|5|Pump sure saves a lot of mess !!!
B002EC0R4Q|5|It was definitely an improvement. I noticed better performance.
B0067ECRP4|5|it filters oil..... enough said
B00P4QLRFM|5|Worked fine for buffing car and aluminum boat hull.
B009Y7MJVS|5|Excellant
B000GU24J4|1|i dont write many reviews but wanted to share my dissatisfaction with this cover to help others avoid buying this thing. this cover is not 100% waterproof. my bike is outdoors every day and i live in FL. water gets through and under the cover regularly. also there's no tie down straps or other elastic along the bottom so if there's any wind it will blow off. i do not recommend this cover. they should not advertise this as waterproof. it's really false advertising unless you're only talking about a fine mist and not real rain storms.
B00NTQLMS6|5|Works good, just as advertised!
B004ZF4SH2|5|Love my kit form Kensun it was simple and easy install. I would highly recommend this brand of HID. You can't go wrong with this kit thank you Kensun!!!
B00326WH32|5|I did email the seller to make sure the middle mats were going to fit perfectly and they did! Very pleased with the product quality.
B00B6DDX5O|1|It didn't take long for the boot to tear.
B00180FWKO|4|I ordered 2 units for a real bargain but I received 2 identical boxes but with 2 different items inside.<br />One made in Japan and one made in Korea.<br />Both are perfectly good and will perform their purpose but it will look funny when one is black and the other is silver.<br />I may end up painting them...
B000UTTOFS|4|I like it but had to return it because I had thought I ordered the HS35 which handles microamps for diodes, flame sensors and whatnot.  Somehow the order got swapped up, which sucks because I'm doing without for the next week of service.  Frustrations aside, this is an expensive and extremely capable multimeter that will not let you down.  Do not hesitate to spend your hard earned money on a Fieldpiece.  I would recommend that you look at the HS35 and even the backlit HS36 before you decide to run with the HS33.  Happy ranging, gents.
B008GGJIHG|4|EASY TO INSTALL, THEY FIT PERFECTLY ON MY 2003 BMW 325I , I ONLY WISH THEY WERE A LITTLE BRIGHTER. STILL WAY BETTER THEN THE STOCK LIGHT THOUGH..
B000FPZXW0|5|Great product.  Just like factory original
B00Q5JRKU8|5|Works great and is a bright yellow so I don't forget it again.
B0002SA3UW|4|Great quality, but after all,  it's Best Top.<br />It's s little long and comes down too far in the back for my liking,  but I can live with it.
B00UPIJX1E|5|Looks great on my back windshield!
B0017JNA6O|5|After our Grand Caravan's passenger side mirror got taken out by a hunk of road debris, I ordered this as a replacement.  It showed up in two days, and after watching a YouTube video (as there are no instructions, but really none are needed), I had it in and working in about 15 minutes.  Most of that time was figuring out the freaking connector!  Cheap and works for me!
B0016GRTVU|4|We get a lot of miserable snow where I live so I need all the tools and help I can get with digging out my car. It does what  is advertised and it works the way it should, I have no complaints thus far.
B008G5AA7E|2|As other reviewers have said, the bottom feet are barely welded and not indicative of a solid design.
B00G620ZVU|5|I used these for offroad night race, these were just as good as $200 Rigid Duallys.
B001HC48D0|4|This is the second Access &#34;Lorado&#34; tonneau cover I've bought and I really, really like them.  The first one lasted 8 full years before it died....for a $300 investment, I think that's a good service life.  While it's not weather PROOF, it'll certainly keep the water out of the bed and your stuff dry.  This new version has a slight texture to the cover material that I like.  While I can see it catching dirt/grime more than a smooth cover, I can also see it hiding blemishes and 'wear-and-tear' better over the long run.  Installation is a breeze if you're even the slightest bit handy w/only simple 1/2&#34; wrenches.  I'd recommend this product highly.
B000CPIJOC|5|One of the best inventions ever, I even used one to bleed my clutch master and slave after replacing both. Worked great and saved a ton of time.
B00Z7BGG3C|4|good
B004CMMFK0|5|Extremely pleasant scent which triggered many memories.  The only drawback that the scent, most of it, disappears after a day or two.
B00FQ0ROZS|4|Nice lights, they are bright and good quality for the price. However these seem to work like flood lights instead of spots, I'm happy with them nonetheless.
B00Z2RCCE8|2|Not loud enough period. Can't hear going 40mph don't waste your money you work for. Took off the bike after 1 week
B001WUT1UM|3|You get what you pay for here. They are a little tricky to get on, and seem to move around alot.<br />Also being black that are bad for collecting alot of lint. I now have to leave a lint brush in my Jeep.
B0038AVEWW|3|Replaced due to stockers being yellow and faded. Internal wiring is thin, I would not trust it for running HID bulbs. Definitely use a relay. Light patten is scattered on low beams, and highs shoot to the sky. Look factor yes, function needs work. Side marker light lens stops at the top and the bulb shows thru form outside. Wish I had bought new stockers. Fit and finish is good. We will see how long the ccfl's last.
B00Q4W1S5Y|5|awsome
B00VF7HZF0|2|I sm glad i tested this before installation. Only the 12 volt outlet works, that is ehy i gave it 2 stars instead of 1. The unit is made of very cheap plastic and the clamp is weak. You could tell this was garbage by the fact of the packaging being written in Chinese. I sm only keeping this for a backup for my GPS now.
B001AIZ5HY|5|Works great. Took ten + years off the Wife's car's headlamps. Takes time and a multi-speed drill (for the pads) but well worth the effort. The video tutorial is a great help. Highly recommended.
B00LV8P744|4|Classic looking, good leather ,well worth the money. .
B000C8ZFS2|3|This is not for a 1999 Escort Wagon but it works, just sticks straight out and not out of the side. But it's a muffler and it works. Just had to expand it to fit over the pipe.
B000C8T8B2|5|It's not as cool as black opps 3 on the one but it does keep your transmission from being destroyed so bonus
B0000AZ7WJ|2|Flimsy, awkward to operate and rather poorly made. About the only people it will keep from taking yourtrailer are you and your friends
B00SK63E54|5|Great idea, great product. Quality construction. I suggest buying a plastic license plate mounting plate at an auto store to attach between your license plate and the metal adapter. They're only a few bucks and it makes the edges of your license plate sturdier so they don't bend over the edge of the adapter, since the adapter is not the exact dimensions of a standard license plate, a little smaller.<br /><br />This one did not fit my 2012 BMW 650 with M Sport package, I misread the list of cars it fits. A little too short and the bolt is narrower.
B00230B53G|5|no comment
B00936PB60|1|Wrong size not even close poorly described in ad
B000E7YP82|4|product has plenty of room. 2 clips broke during 1 and only time using bag(if you can tell me how or where i can get replacement clips that would be great)
B002J8379C|5|These pads are great!  Do yourself a favor and get these pads.  Never use terry cloth pads they will leave tiny scratches.  I found this out the hard way on a motorcycle.  I strictly use foam pads.  The original pads that came with my Meguiar's waxes/scratch removers/ and polish compounds had started to breakdown after 10 years of use.  So I went to every parts store and retail location I could think of in search of foam pads.  No luck.  Thankfully after one internet search I found the foam pads here.  Not sure if the more expensive brands are better, but these pads have always produced quality results for me.
B0018EV9QQ|3|If you wear a tshirt underneath and it rains and it's hot out, you'll regret it.  Sweat to death.  Not breathable.
B000F2ZVVG|3|had to have shop re-hem product to perfect fit.  Does require sewing machine to correct fit.
B00C0XCHKG|5|Great
B00P7F2WEA|5|I am very pleased with the helmet quality for the amount that I paid.  The size that I ordered was a Large which if you go by the size chart, it is pretty right on.  Very comfortable, good ventilation but the only issue that I have is the wind noise as it is a little more pronounced then my Shoei.  If I had to do it over again, I would still purchase the helmet.
B00T2ITIYK|5|Perfect fit!!
B009T4P1DE|5|Installed on a 2007 KLR 650. Easy install, though i did have to shave my throttle tube just a hair to get the right grip to slide on.  Also had to trim the ends of the grips to get them to work with my bark busters, but that only took a minute to do.  Fired them up and they get warm pretty quickly. The only downside was finding a good spot for all the extra wiring, but I tucked it under the tank, and the install looks clean and functions well.
B004NO3LKA|5|Product works as advertised.
B00EWHNZUE|3|ok
B00R2IT4AU|5|Worked perfectly !
B0046JX9HW|5|Just what I needed. Seller was very helpful too. This will make grocery shopping, with my truck, much easier. I no longer will have to climb in the bed of my truck, under my tonneau cover, to get groceries that have escaped the bag.
B003BZD03K|5|Great price.  Much cheaper than hardware stores.  Works great.
B004OJZDAK|5|excellent
B00K889FCI|4|Product worked much better than expected.
B002K60CNM|3|It's ok i think but not work with my car...
B00JJYPATO|5|As described
B0022ZXO40|3|sloppy fit unless your hauling something really big for a motorcycle. I it is well made.
B008MZPTJW|1|Don't stick well and wasn't delivered the date expected. Over all very mispleased.
B003UVCY00|2|Just plugged in to charge per instructions upon delivery....after 1.5 hours red and green lites flashing...manual indicates battery is overheated...hope I dont have a defective item...will update review after I test product.
B002UC2Q0S|5|Fit perfectly, no new holes were needed to be drilled.  This replaced a nylon catch, so I hope it lasts many years to come.
B002EOACWQ|5|These things fit perfectly and catch everything including snow and sand, a must if you live where it snows.. Keeps your carpet clean and and the mats look good. Make the investment and it will payback when you sell your vehicle with clean carpet.
B00U6I7LK8|5|I bought these bags for my husband's motorcycle. They look extremely sleek and sturdy, and look like they will last a long time even in the weird weather we get here in the South! These bags are a great value and a great buy.
B00267PZUK|5|Great
B004554552|2|This is a dated version that doesn't actually work with the pumps that are made anymore. I had to throw it away.
B000N9PJ7W|4|it was exactly what I wanted
B000KKMXQ4|4|Product as defined, but old packaging. Item still worked well.
B00T7DR7FW|5|Button works great. Wish they would send a cut sheet on all the terminals to make it easier to connect. Great fitment.
B00JLJV1ZO|5|Works as advertised.
B003YLMQHC|5|Worked perfectly. Received parts sooner than the date proposed.
B00BFDGL4K|5|Key worked perfectly after I had it cut and programmed. Thanks
B0036E9VB6|5|I wasn't sure what to expect when I received this unit. I was surprised at how well built it is and how well it performs. I use it often and have been very happy with it. An impressive tool.
B001KS8710|5|Quick and easy
B001KSGMUI|5|Works Great Fixed My TITAN Overheating problem
B004SX5HNA|5|Great set!  Easy to use and set up! Great light! Gets attention!
B004ZF3DYG|4|I received the HID Kit within the stated time. They were very easy to set up did not need the instructions and bulbs a very bright
B00D4522AY|1|this battery doesn't fit key's board. i have bmw 325i 2003 e46.<br />pins should be in position that is on the picture
B0002SRL20|4|Very honest description and it worked just fine. It's still holding up and I still use it. Decent price and like I said I've had no problems with it. You're getting exactly what it is, no more, no less.
B00ADPVJS4|5|Great price with fast prime shipping!
B003ZOH63W|5|Part would not fit my application.  First time to request a return of anything purchased on Amazon.  Will wait and see the outcome.  The part appeares to be excellent but will not fit. I do not have as response to my return request yet.
B00CCZ12WQ|4|Have had the helmet for about a month now. Snapped right into my Shoei 1100 helmet well. Iridium reflection is great, can definitely feel the relief on my eyes with the UV protection. Riding east in the morning is much much easier now. Would recommend to others. Be ready to keep it clean.
B00Y3H48FY|5|Thanks
B00E2U3S6W|5|I was worried about purchasing this light because it's so cheap compared to other light bars, but we installed it on my atv, using a wiring harness that we purchased sperately, and we've had it in water and mud. It's still working!! I'll be purchasing another for my other atv.
B004BTJ38G|1|did not work 91 honda accord 2.2 lx.
B006MM3O3A|5|Works perfectly so far.
B00NTR458Y|5|Worked very well
B00Q3DNW5I|5|worked great, just what I needed. Thanks
B00EAMBIT6|5|It's work good
B00ULO0028|1|Very poor quality, looks cheap junk knock off compared to what the dealership sell here in the USA. I WANT A FULL REFUND!
B007Z8VG30|1|Letters come off easily
B00J5KRUHM|5|This is an amazing trash can for the car. It is wide and sturdy and VERY VERY well made.
B000BRFQKQ|4|worked well little sticky to unlatch till you use them a while
B00BYH6C1E|5|They work great in my 2015 Dodge Journey!
B005DJRDDK|5|Fit great, no drilling and looks fantastic.
B0000C6F0W|1|These suck!  Installed them and they don't work right since there is a screw head and a nut instead of a rivot like the original one is held in place.  The nut on one side does not allow for full rotation of bracket.  The screw scratched up my brand new outboard.  Either buy a replacement bracket or the entire transom saver.
B00CVVUQ50|2|The sticker itself is pretty nice, but the emblem itself is pretty cheap.  Had to make adjustments for trunk emblem.  The wheel center caps were terrible, with one of my own falling off somewhere in the free way.  Decent product if you put adhesive on everything.
B000CITK8S|5|excellent product - excellent vendor
B00J8WBPQO|5|Perfect fit on my h2 2005
B00N2K6M2A|1|Firmware is not 2.1 only 1.5 does not work with my VW Touran and my BMW E90
B000HEBR3I|5|I use it every week and it works great.
B00U5GLBF2|5|Arrived on time! I Loved the kit it made my car appear like new when I attached the decals to my center console. Would highly recommended. Also, remember to use a hair dryer when applying the decals. The hair dryer does the trick in the end😁
B00PUCTW66|5|PERFECT !!!!!! !!!!makes my 2005 look like a brand new car
B001GJ3E2K|3|its m  ok
B00EDOSLY6|5|Worked great on my TL and didn't need resistors for dash warning light.
B00NW8PHEQ|5|It's like someone figured out what you need.
B004C0U40U|5|Excellent
B00B29UFHG|4|The ones I had in my 2013 fit a lot better. But these still are good best I have seen
B00062YJ3Q|5|i have used k&n filters for many years and will continue to do so in the future
B000E28CK4|5|Filter oil like no ones business. Last several oil changes in the SM.
B0027XEKQ8|5|Perfect fit.
B000CNN26E|5|Fits my 2013 ram 1500 quad cab. Not a whole lot of cab noise but it does sounds great!
B00KZPN6UQ|5|no comment
B003SS62PS|1|Could not plug it in in my trailer.  Very disappointed.
B0042H6BA0|5|This bag worked great! It fit three large suitcases/duffel bags and easily and securely attached to the top of our car. We purchased cinch ties to use with the bag, and they worked great.
B00SC5AV7W|5|Fits perfectly, makes the seatbelt in my GMC much more comfortable and easier to use.  Very sturdy.
B00LBAC12S|5|this is the absolute best addition to my 2014 jku. still capable of getting sun, but it keeps me and the kids from getting burned. also cut back on the wind turbulence.
B00BS102A8|5|Love it!
B005NLQAHS|3|I was really excited about this product. I have a 2008 Sienna Limited and wanted to keep track of any engine issues. First time I plugged it in it worked right off the bat. Downloaded Torque and DashCommand. Work well for about a day, then suddenly the scan tool would not connect. I plugged it in and out, nothing. Next day tried again it worked, then later that afternoon did not. Returned it.<br /><br />Now I may have gotten a defective unit, but did not want to replace it. After using it a few days, I realized the information given it just not sufficient enough. I need info on Transmission, ABS etc. This does not give detailed info. I am willing to spend the extra cash to get more info as I like to fix stuff myself. I also Found Dash-Commander seemed to be a better user friendly App. Gives you more pertinent info right off the bat and Fuel Economy on the App is better than Torque Pro. You have to purchase the MPG consumption separately, which is $4.00 on Torque.
B00BAZCBVK|5|Perfect
B008427D88|5|Great Buy
B001NI7KE2|1|I received the product and one side was hooked over the loop and one side was hooked under.  It looks like it will fall off.  The product does not look like the picture.
B00ICV9OLK|5|Excellent
B0028OJAIY|4|Tunes are ok. The drip on their side if the lid is not replaced
B00E3EWNVS|4|worked as it should. Suction cups were a little below par.
B00IKJ5ZPI|5|Ok
B00QVNSRW8|5|very happy with tool and service
B00252JBP6|5|Perfect fit
B000BRJVUW|3|It's a switch.  I'm using it to power a 12v ceiling fan in my shed.  Works well for that purpose.  When I power on the fan using this switch, a half second passes and bearly audible click is heard from the switch and then the fan gets powered.
B00BCRM9YA|5|Easy to install and its great that it comes with everything you need for your car as most sets only include the front seats covers. This set comes with adjustable S-hooks so you just have to be careful while installing and everything should fit in nicely!
B00YYCDLR4|1|Useless.
B0075SUCM6|5|Looks great!
B00BD4X90K|4|One was creased out of the box which lead to bubbling once it was applied.
B00T6JIHDI|5|Worked extremely well, a lot easier than using a punch and hammer.
B000EA5WLS|5|Awesome, was able to fix about 4 chips on multiple vehicles. Great product would buy it again.
B00WG924K2|4|Easy to Install - These mirror glass replacements Install in Minutes! This may have been true if instructions and mounting tape had been included.....misleading!
B00NXRX8RY|1|Total Junk. These were supposed to be for a Mercedes 2006 C230 Sedan but they do not fit. I missed the return window and this is now junk in my garage
B00CP8K726|5|Smell thaaa sooooo goooood one!!!! i du the laik sooo mut ah soo da goood one!!! smell lika japan
B001PWA0IO|5|UPDATE: Original purchase made two and a half years ago. Lift strut gave out so purchased product again to replace strut. Cheaper then trying to find a replacement heavy duty strut.<br /><br />Not difficult to install. Works well. Drops tailgate very smoothly.
B00MGD5L6M|5|Son loves them and that is what matters.
B0000AY69V|4|It's great at soaking up messes, but do not run this over your car if you want perfect paint after a wash. These chamois tend to pick up debris and scratch paint. Most professional detailers say to never use these, but use polyester microfiber cloths instead.<br /><br />So I would keep this in the kitchen
B00QFY2BCK|3|Worked somewhat, but if headlight has a lot of fogging on it, then you will still have some when done.
B00RUE3DSA|5|As described thanks
B00SS3SGJI|5|Love the sticker! Bright colors - good quality
B009JTRTUM|5|These are some awesome  springs. Rides really  smooth. .
B00BSM4UPA|5|Great
B004PHDWMM|5|I'm assuming these will work if ever needed, but I'm going with 5 stars because they are a very handy size and something people should have in their residences. May be a good idea to send with your student to college as well!
B000HE8VQ4|5|Nice part, but not small.  I could have gotten by with two of the three tubes.
B00VF2IC9I|3|Excellent while it lasted but had a problem with the charging circuit. InnoLife, the seller, was very helpful and most cooperative in honoring the warranty. Will buy another from the seller. The unit will, indeed, start a car with no problem. Accidentally killed the battery in my Honda to the point where the starter would only click. The unit started the car like a fully charged car battery.
B000182DX8|1|The fitment was terrible on the rear visors, over half an inch short on both sides. Also, the small vertical edges on all four pieces did not have tape applied out of the box. I had to return this as I couldn't get them to look right no matter how much stretching, helping hands, or additional tape was thrown at the problem. I am well versed in installing window visors as I have done so for 3 of my other vehicles. This product simply doesn't work.
B0012TWRBS|5|I put this on the right handlebar of my Goldwing Gl1800.  I mounted a butler cup on the top one and was able to keep it out of the way of most of the dash board.  I put a phone X mount on the other.  Both work well.
B000CITCXQ|5|Everything line up just right no seeks. Thanks
B0071Q97JG|5|Pleased.received in timely manner.
B000LG0BGQ|5|Works great
B00KTJ2U8W|5|Was exactly the one I wanted.  The only negative thing is the &#34;chip&#34;!  It is a pain in the neck to have to have it programed and it is not cheap either.
B003VGHBMA|5|Perfect fit
B003DMFDM2|5|Did fit very well.
B00495UQT2|3|For the price its a good value, kinda small.
B00XWY0I9E|5|Best Price EVER!!  I put them on a week or so ago and so far so good.  They look really nice on, they are keeping the rain out.  Very Happy!!!
B0002Q80GS|5|All trucks need one.
B00CMB1II8|5|Arrived on time and worked great!
B0087XOTWW|5|They work and will use them in a friends car next.
B009XIQ7G6|5|James is the only way to go
B0051SE8TK|5|Someone liberated the last one from me so I needed another one. Plug was as advertised and on time.
B0039BW3IE|5|Perfect fit, superb design, high quality, and fast shipment (arrived like 4 days earlier than projected)!
B00F8LP2TK|5|fast shipping, product is exactly how described and worked great
B00BTL6FRG|5|works well.
B00LMLHDBU|5|every thing was great
B000BGK080|5|Was as advertised, worked fine.
B00T9SRQXI|5|It's perfect. Pretty cool and I get alot of compliments when I ride.
B00BG8OCFO|5|I did a bunch of research on all sorts of covers. I knew I wanted a very slim profile that was super easy to use and solid. Backflip VP was my choice. I have heard from others that the roll back and push back versions tend to stick and leak. The VP looks super stealth and has a seamless top that looks clean and sharp. Super easy to install. 6 brackets and 2 bolts. Seriously took me 45 min. I would highly recommend this cover.
B001F532PY|5|Performed as advertised
B008K8SFA6|4|Bought 2 of these to go with a Dorman FOB/programmer for my 2006 Grand Prix.  I was able to program all 3 remotes in seconds.  Of the 3 remotes, the Dorman had the shortest range, but the range of these remotes was amazing.  I can even start my car from inside the basement of my office building without having line of site to my car outside at grind level. I am docking 1 Arar because one of the two remotes locks, unlocks and starts the car ok, but when I hit unlock, it turns on the fog lights and tail lights and they just stay on unless I lock the car or start the car.  Not sure if the would eventually turn off, but after 5 minutes  (the headlights shut off after 30 seconds like they should) the fog and tail light still don't shut off. So odd.  I tried to reprogram it again, but it hasn't changed.  Still works otherwise, and I really don't need 3 of these unless one of them fails.
B005SB0JJS|5|These worked out perfectly and look great!
B007Y867DA|5|So far so good. Performed the starter upgrade on my Fiero... Bolted right up to the 2.8 with no shims required. Car now starts like a million bucks. Will update if anything goes wrong.
B0042VTYXM|5|good for emergency responders
B004BSPN5O|5|Fast delivery. Just as described. Thanks!
B00PNU8DV0|5|a bitch to install, but worth the price
B00G0OU3A2|5|Fit Perfect 2005 tundra
B001N3B3U4|5|Thanks! I bought one off ebay (a generic) and this one is 10,000 times better.
B00EIIH6PC|5|It does exactly what it says it does. The crack is hardly visible. It's been about 2 months now, still no problem with it. I'm still waiting for winter to see if any water can get into it and freeze/expand. But based on the looks of it, I don't think it'll be a problem.
B00JRHI1LM|5|Very pleased with this mattress it is all they say it is. Would recommend to all who are thinking of buying one.
B00AQPRG2O|5|Same as the factory pads. They work on my HD.
B000EDOSKQ|5|It was perfect for me to use I didn't have to put holes in the roof of my camper this product work great.
B00AWYDFQA|5|I really like this little jack. It's the perfect tool for those who don't want to sweat it.
B0002NYDYY|5|Makes repacking my Travel Trailer bearings much easier and cleaner
B005S09XUA|5|Fit my 2010 Honda Pilot perfectly.  These two bars were super easy to install.  I attach my kayak racks to these bars.  They easily support the weight of my 12ft, one person, sit inside kayak.  I did notice that my gas mileage took a small hit after these were installed.  The mpg hit was between .5 and 1.
B00C9V4EHI|1|Didn't work for my 2002 shadow spirit 1100. It was too small
B00UEMH5L6|5|Just received my order and slapped them on. Took less than 10 minutes. Looks good on my new Wrangler!
B00C2T2VXQ|5|This stuff is like 40 pounds xD the box was way heavier than I imagined.  saying that it definitely killed all vibrations in my roof (roof still flexes after 1 layer but no noise from it so it's all good xD). For the price this stuff is really thick compared to dynamat and looks really good too. I actually wanna sound deaden my back wall and leave the plastic off (2001 sport trac). It's good the Sq pattern on it but the green is like a shiny reflective green which to me is a plus (#BlingLife xD). All in all this stuff is killer I only used 5? Sheets on my roof total (around 20 Sq ft). So half of it is left over. If you're on the fence between or any other deadener get this!!
B000C9FE3C|4|gets the job done
B000VASHOK|3|Tried putting them on in the winter wouldn't  stay trust me paint yours with transparent  paint instead of these bulky things I will say you can see the red tail light just fine at night there ok
B007D0QK0E|1|Awsome work out great
B000KDZJL2|4|I've only used this for a day, so I may want to edit this review later as I learn how well the product holds up.<br />It's half the price of the HD headset and so far, it sounds great.<br />It's designed for a open face helmet, but I easily installed it on a Scorpion half-helmet.  The Scorpion helmet has pockets for the earpieces, and I used 3 wire ties to secure the microphone to the V-strap that connects to the chin strap.<br /><br />I read reviews that point out that the wires are thin.  This is absolutely true, however those wires should not experience much movement, so I'm not too worried.<br /><br />Another review mentioned that his mini-DIN connector on the helmet wore out.  I took his advice and also used wire ties to secure the mini-DIN connector to the V-strap so it doesn't move around.<br /><br />There are two things I think the manufacturer could do to make the product better:<br />1. Use thicker gauge wires.  I wouldn't have to be a lot thicker.<br />2. Make the foam pads around the speakers removable.  The pockets in my helmet are small and have their own padding, so it was a bit of a tight fit.
B000C0UMO2|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B00B8X3JPQ|4|Great product looks great on the jeep. easy to install. However one sidemarker tab broke super easy.
B003UYYGTO|5|Great for your ATV's and UTV's....worked perfect on my 2010 Teryx and the only thing I needed to do was get longer bolts for my 2015 Ranger as the Ranger has a bigger OD tubing than the Teryx.
B00JNEAQIA|5|These seem just as good or better than the factory chrome lugs that came on my 2011 wrangler. Just installed so not sure of the longevity of the lug.<br /><br />Used a plastic shopping bag around the lug to make sure I didn't scuff them when installing.<br /><br />Looks really good with my all black rims.
B00OXSDRRI|4|A BIT SMALL FOR MY THICK NECK, AND PRETTY STIFF MEMORY FOAM... BUT FITS MY WIFE/FAMILY MEMBERS PERFECT.
B006N9GIM6|5|On time, and exactly what I expected.
B013B3J7D8|1|The magnet backing isn't strong enough to stay on my car. I don't recommend these as magnets
B00EC8307G|3|it will work for what I wanted to do.
B00FJVAHG2|5|Thanks, they were great. Easy to install,  had both installed in 30 minutes.
B0019IB9PM|5|Replaced this reciever/dryer component on my 2004 rsx when my compressor needed replacement; (my owners maintenance manual recommended it) So far it works exactly like it is supposed to.
B003MD3TKK|5|They were good enough to get stolen so I'd say you'll like them
B000EBMKAS|5|Serves every purpose I wanted it for plus some I hadn't even thought of.  Definitely a &#34;keeper&#34;.
B00AX03E2I|5|Cool
B003NDPUP6|5|WORKS GREAT ADN ENJOY SAVING THE MONEY FROM REPLACING FILTERS.
B0002MSY7M|5|Good !
B00JHK81X2|5|Given to my grandson along with keys to my older Tahoe as a surprise for his 16th birthday.  I am sure this kit will come in handy.<br />Had so many useful items in it - great for the price.
B006X6MCU6|5|Worked great.  Quality was A+
B00WVV5SD0|5|Great Product, Easy to put on. Wife can put it on by herself.
B0040CVOH2|5|I relocate cars between dealerships and these screws make my job easier.  Putting a license plate on requires little or no effort.  Perfect!
B002OUMVWY|5|Works very well - more robust than many sewer hoses of its ilk. The hose itself is well built, and easily adjusts as needed to connect from your RV to a sewer drain opening. Easily stores in MOST RV sewer drain compartments, unless you have a very small storage area.
B010UTPZRS|4|I replaced the bulbs in my travel trailer, the old bulbs put off too much heat. These bulbs are not as bright as the standard bulbs in a RV but worked great with little heat and soft light in the cabin areas.
B000VKN4R0|5|The bearings arrived in less time than expected, nearly a week less! And, the bearings were just great. I'm riding on them right now. Time will tell how they hold up but I've only heard good things!
B00B9OR1ZS|1|I agree with the other posters that 2 out of the 3 o rings are the wrong size if you have a later model cherokee (Mine is a 1998 xj). Seller should specify the years in the descripption.
B00FSBC5N6|5|We used to replace a stolen emblem off the hood of a 2013 Acura ILX
B001DBSYJ4|1|It was very short for an F250  said it would fit but didnt  Possibly the tailgate
B003DNL8ZC|5|Perfect fit
B008S9CHZG|4|Great helmet for the price.  Nice and cool with plenty of venting.  The chin straps are always a pain to get used to but this one works fine.
B0036IA6JI|5|fit perfectly!
B000JG4GCS|3|I'm sure it will work fine for a bike but I was using it for a race car and it would not hole up to the extra torque of 2 wide wheels.
B0108MXD9O|5|good Product
B000BO8M8C|4|An excellent product. Works really great and easy to use. Great if you want to maintain flexability.
B003VASR4M|4|Good fittings
B00BF8N6Q6|5|Claimed to be &#34;Original Equipment&#34; wipers these were much more substantial than the factory wipers.  The material seemed to be better quality also.  The dealer wanted 85.00 for replacement blades so these are a real bargain.  Changing them is literally as simple as pushing a button.
B00B3RGOHW|5|Excellent
B0045L97S6|5|Good value for a quality tool.
B007V2B46O|5|Fits perfectly in my 2010 Toyota Rav 4. Best sunshade I have ever purchased.

B003O74NNG|5|HD Dyna is running for 25,000 miles and still going.
B001AVQOOY|5|Fit perfectly!
B003TODXQW|5|A great tool for making frequently assembled/disassembled items simpler.

B009AE3U9U|5|Great ty
B00496MAWC|4|good product, good price, shipping took too long otherwise good
B000ZAL7FC|5|Purchased for my 06 Trailblazer, very easy to install and matched the interior very well. Seem to be well made and quite durable. They are also easy to remove and clean.
B0077S1BBU|5|Worked great!
B000C5E4OQ|1|Buyer Beware!!  Made from hard, brittle plastic that breaks at the slightest touch. Both pieces broke trying to install, using very little effort.  Product was totally unusable and too much trouble to try and return.
B00DQRSK9C|5|GOOD
B000C59XME|5|Toughest components around.  Priced well.  Perform well, and will last a long time.
B005JZSP08|5|WORKS VERY WELL!
B007V2CPN0|4|It seems to work well by keeping the car cooler. The insulation really helps. Its getting a 4 star because it still is too new to rate it fully.
B01092IFZK|4|I like them but i had to send back seat back because i have bucket sit because the lift up to get to the third seat row.<br />So they have not return yet.
B00S7S90K8|4|This seller is great to work with and I thank them so much though the product did not work for my needs I have no doubt about it had I been able to use it.
B00YTM7YCW|4|The stickers I got are all the same as the product image, except no mickey mouse or raccoon. There are some not in that picture of course. Anime, video games, quite a few halloween stickers that were OK. There were some stickers that weren't duplicates but they were of the same thing. Like two different stickers of the superhero guy or two pictures of different lips. Some seemed like they were designed for a discount child's product or show that fell through. About 15 of them were just painfully dull, like a red t-shirt or a stock photo of a film reel - three different line drawings on a beige background. Like, why even make this into a sticker?<br /><br />I cherry picked some stickers to go on top at eye level and there were maybe 10 stickers that I would buy, maybe 30 that weren't so bad, and the rest I didn't care for. I don't know why there were any bad stickers, like someone just accidentally printed off 2,000 &#34;peeling sticker effect&#34; pumpkins or 700 sitting cows and needed some way to get rid of them.
B00Q7HV6NA|5|It is bright easy to install and when I put it in reverse it blinds people I love it.
B00B5FG91I|4|A little taller than the cup holder, but fits like it's suppose to in the console
B00GE9Y5IE|5|Product fits perfectly on my 2015 chevy Silverado...looks great!
B01092I9LA|4|quality OK but it fited well.
B000C5G66U|5|Fits perfectly
B00IWL067G|1|I'm sure this is a very fine product, but I guess I'll never know-Amazon only has a driver's side replacement mirror, and I need a passenger side mirror. Oh, well...
B005HWTGQU|2|Wires and the wire connectors were cheap.  had to rework them.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Hauling s***...hauling s***.
B008FCE556|5|They fit my car great. We didn't have any problems.
B00KOA2JF0|5|The resistors worked as advertised. My only concern is that you cannot put the covers behind the lights back on when using these. So far I've had them on the car about a month and no error messages.
B000C9I8PS|5|Fits perfect on my 2002 Chevy avalanche 1500, SES light turned on so I needed replacement, autozone was charging me $192 after I got a code p0446, ACdelco gots you Bruhh
B00FKPJJNY|5|Arrived quickly and are super bright. They come with a sticky back to make upside down install easy.
B00JHOHBNY|1|Did not fit my S10. Light cover was too small
B005SSKVYE|5|Worked great!!
B000IYT158|5|does the job well
B000RN4FK6|5|Very happy and love it😍👍🏼
B007XZK5M8|5|Best mirrors I have used . Perfect fit !
B0000AXDG4|5|I bought this to cover a 94 Lincoln Town Car hoping that it would be large enough to fit my land yacht. It fits with room to spare! Material seems durable and I've had no rips or any other trouble over the past few weeks. Was a great purchase to keep paw prints from the neighbor's cat from mucking up my wash & wax on a car that isn't a daily driver.
B00VM84DTS|4|Was just about what I wanted, not as big as I had hoped it would be.
B002PLGL1Y|5|Awesome part , people and experience. Got the part within 3 days and fixed the problem
B000TGF8YI|5|This is a great screwdriver!  I only wish I had known about JIS screws and screwdrivers ten years ago.  This makes working on a motorcycle much easier and no more stripped out Phillips Head screws.  Plus the Vessel brand is much superior to other less expensive brands.  Count me a very satisfied customer!
B003TAB6Q0|5|Awesome
B000CQDIHY|4|I put these on my '92 Jeep XJ. Installation is very easy, and doesn't take long (I think cleaning the rubber window seals take longer than the actual install.<br /><br />All the Ventshades are straight, and only go along the tops of the windows that actually open. Thus, if you have Wing Windows, they will still open all the way, and any way. ;)<br /><br />The Venshades look great! I really like that they go inside the Windows Frame, and are not mounted to the outside of the doors. :)<br /><br />The only things I don't really like are:<br /><br />1. The paint on the Venshades seems very low quality. (One of my shades came scratched underneath in the very corner, which exposed the metal, so I guess we'll see how it will hold up to rust. I did not damage any of the paint with any of the clips (from what I can tell anyway).<br /><br />2. The clips are pretty much crap on all accounts. Some of them &#34;click&#34; into place, but I found a lot of the time, they were just loose (just tight enough to not fall out...well mostly). It appears that the Rubber Window Seal is really the thing that holds the clips (and the shades) in place more than anything else.<br /><br />3. The fit is kind of funky.<br /><br />A. After the shades are installed, there are these holes (little gaps) in all the corners (between the shade and the door frame) where you can see daylight. This is because there is no material on the shade in this location. I think this should definitely be addressed by the manufacturer.<br /><br />B. After installing the first Ventshade, it appeared that it wasn't quite flush against the window frame. It doesn't look bad, it just doesn't look like it's 100% parallel with the top. It appears to bow some. I tried to adjust this by pushing up on the sides, but it really doesn't seem to help. You'll just end up making your clips fall out, or making something else not fit/look right. It's like this for all four.<br /><br />4. The windows won't seal all the way (at least with the electric ones anyway). The windows do go all the way up, they just won't go into the seal anymore. The clips behind the seal pich it just enough to prevent the window from going inside. It's really not that tight, I can tell by opening the seal with my finger, I just don't think the power window motors have enough power to.push it up all the way. Then again, part of the reason for having these is so you can leave your windows cracked. ;) They do still seal well enough to go through the car wash without leaking...well, if you didn't have leakage before. ;)<br /><br />All in all, I would probably buy them again. Even with all their quirks. They look great, are easy to install, and work like they're supposed to. Time will only tell how well they hold up to the elements.
B00X52FKU0|5|does the job
B0090Q1V80|5|It fits in perfectly and also protects the dash from heating up. I used it on my toyota rav4 2015. It also fits other suv like Nissan rogue and lexus and other models perfectly.
B007ZLLM9K|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B00XZ6WSCO|5|great sticker
B00062YIKA|5|Better fuel economy and more power as advertised
B00KW1ZEMG|5|Very simple to use, fit perfectly
B00NRDS4TG|5|Works and loonet makes it easy to.ks good, and being that it is a mag remove
B00HCJ7JWO|2|Not like the original STICKER, these letters/numbers are a CUTOUT that you have to carefully apply. Material is THIN THIN so it takes some effort to get it right.
B0008F68MG|4|worked well with my camper/trailer
B00KTITKN6|4|Installed this in a 2006 Prius.  These pumps are known common failure points, sometimes making more noise that can be heard for a few seconds after you turn off the car.  This pump fits exactly the same (if you install just the pump to the old bracket you can save some time, instead of replacing the old bracket as it comes with the new pump).  I'm not sure if this pump is a better design though.
B003EOVIEG|3|Material to thin. Feels like plastic.
B00KZ5Q1RG|5|Look great fits perfect
B00BDPFPNI|5|As advertised.
B000PIGH54|5|They seem just fine. I'm just an idiot and they weren't exactly what I was looking for for my purposes.
B00X313ETW|5|Very speedy delivery and the product was in perfect condition once it got to me. I am very pleae we d with the new look and fit of my swing arm spools. Thank you and I look forward to buying from i5 again.
B004NNLE82|5|Excellent
B00P30XVQW|5|Look great on my 2014 silverado installation was a breeze also they are sturdy and block alot of rocks from hitting my truck
B00NH55VKE|5|Excellent
B0012TWSSA|5|I always have a couple with me for costuming. It works wonderful
B003DRA9US|5|I have to admit, I was pretty skeptical at first, but for the price why not take a chance? I bought some 55mm Chevy center cap emblems to put on these (they come plain) and they look great! Huge improvement over the scratched originals. They are made of a very sturdy plastic and the clicking noise that developed from the originals went away after I put these on. Even if these loosen over time, or the finish starts to crack, I would buy a new set every year, at this price, to make my car look this great again. But, I don't foresee any problems developing anytime soon. Great Product.
B00SCCWDXA|5|nice look
B000TV59EC|5|Works as advertised.  A little pricey so I will try to find something else effective but less expensive.
B004O9WC18|5|Very happy with this rear cargo mat. Fit perfectly in my 2015 Grand Cherokee. Exact match to my previous purchase of the front and rear slush mats.
B00LT0J42U|5|Looks awesome on my 2004 Dodge Ram :)
B0013RIOPC|5|Works Great.
B007SBFP2W|5|Coolest decal ever. I love it!
B005NLQAHS|3|Product worked for a few weeks and then just stopped working. Didn't matter which vehicle i plugged my phone into
B000EDOT8C|5|Purchased this to put on top of the stove in our Jayco 26BH.  Absolutely love it!  Turns our unused stove top into usable and very needed counter space.  The cutting board has a drip edge and a nice non-slip mat attached to the bottom.  The non-slip mat does an amazing job at preventing the board from sliding around.  The board also comes with a plastic cutting mat, and works great to prevent knife marks being put into the board itself.  Doubles as a serving tray too.
B00F66TA86|5|Works great. Fairly easy to install. Being a recently retired auto tech I must give GM credit on the design allowing for easy replacement. It is replaceable from the bottom of the steering column. You do not need to remove the steering wheel switches etc. to replace this part.
B00T2GT9L4|5|I haven't had to jump a car with it, but I've used the flashlight and I've used it to charge my devices on road trips (when my charger port was in use for the GPS that's always dead).  It worked great, very easy, and so small and convenient to store in my car.  I haven't even recharged it yet and it's still working great.  Good product!
B00N8NBJPG|5|Fit perfect on my 2012 BMW Z4 28i....looks great matches emblem on center of wheel cover.Locking feature excellent.
B00SSCDCSO|5|Bad ass!!! But you better not buy them if you live in La/Ms, I wanna be unique😋
B0034ZL3I6|5|Outstanding performance for a bolt on part.
B007KA7PP6|1|Not up to par on this one.😣
B00SBZAG5U|2|It was thinner than I expected considering the cost. Also the included caps seemed to be too large to cover the screws so I didn't use them. Not sure why they would include oversized daps to cover the screws if they are too large.
B005NLQAHS|5|Tried the pay version of Torque with this adapter and it works great!  Customer service is equally impressive as well.  I was contacted via email and asked if things were going okay with the adapter and if I needed any information.  I wasn't sure exactly how to setup custom gauges and PIDs and I was a little worried about messing up what I already had.  So I asked about it thinking it'll be a while before I get a response.  Checked my email the next day and I had great step-by-step instructions, and the emails are always courteous and sincere.  I took the instructions and applied it and it worked great!  Setup my own gauges with the parameters I set and I'm experimenting with like crazy now.  In case there is anyone out there that needs to know how, I've included the instructions in this review.  See below.  Have fun!!<br /><br />  From the main menu of Torque press the &#34;realtime information&#34; button &#62; On the following screen swipe with your finger left or right to a blank screen or somewhere that has space where you can add a new dial in &#62; Press and hold the blank part of the screen where you want the new display to be located &#62; Keep pressing your finger on this blank part of the screen until a dialog box opens &#62; When the dialog box opens, select &#34;add display&#34; &#62; On the next screen choose what format you want the new information to be shown to you &#62; The next screen that will open is the &#34;add sensor&#34; screen &#62; If you are currently connected to the vehicle, any sensor shown in green is one that your vehicle supports for reading &#62; scroll the list and select the one you want to add &#62; Then it will open a new dialog, select what size you want the display to be (for phones I recommend the medium or smaller size) &#62; The new display will now be added to your screen! &#62; You can move the display around while it is highlight in purple &#62; If you want to move or delete it later, press and hold the disaply until adialog box opens again and select the action you wish to perform.<br /><br />Also, as a side note, some of the sensors that appear in the list that you can choose from are not actually sensors on your vehicle. What I mean is....... take the MPG reading in that list for example. The MPG information is not actually pulled from the vehicle, instead this is a reading that is ESTIMATED by Torque based on other information it gathers and the information you have entered into Torque about your vehicle (such as weight, tanks size etc etc). So readings like this will not always be accurate. If you want to know which of these sensors are like this, open Torque and go to the sensor list while you are NOT connected to the vehicle. The sensors that appear in green while you are not connected to any vehicle, are the ones that are either based off of Torque estimates OR the GPS or other sensors in your phone!
B00537FR08|5|As I expected
B0023VKVV2|5|Product worked perfectly after installation. Nice clear lense with good color. Would buy again if I break another!
B000I1H0X6|5|As I expected
B00BV6UKV6|5|This was a perfect replacement for the factory transmission that had plastic ends.  The unit shipped ( 7/2015) had the cast metal ends (painted black).
B002ESXIOQ|4|Installed easily. The visor fits very snuggly. Would buy again if needed a visor clip. FYI, when I say the clip is snug, it really is. You need to use a little muscle to put the visor in place and to unclip it but it is manageable.
B0049J75D8|2|Manufacturer and Amazon states that it fits a base model Pontiac G6 4cyl.  The metal quality, flanges and bend of the pipe are fine, HOWEVER, the overall length of the pipe is incorrect. It's actually 3/4 of an inch too short. This required me to drive my car over to a muffler shop and have them weld up an additional pipe between the two holed flange on the Walker pipe and the two holed flange on my OEM pipe that goes toward the resonator.  As this was an unexpected cost due to an oversight by the manufacturer and Amazon.., I'm giving it two stars.
B00X6CM9EO|5|My daughter loves these shoes.
B008032QKG|5|The fit was spot on
B00206I20C|3|This works fine, I just think all these european connectors are over priced...
B00BTLEJXI|4|Very satisfied with the product.  The fabric is soft.  Installation was easy after watched their video on YouTube.  Looks good in my new 2015 toyota tacoma double cab.<br /><br />Con: package came with one headrest cover ripped, but I don't use the back seat headrests.<br />No hole for back seat seat belt, but I pulled off the zipper a little and it fits fine.<br />Hey, the cost is fraction of the price compare to other products.
B00AX03BTE|5|awesome  nice touch to any rim
B000CB0ND6|1|I have bought this oil cap for my Mitsubishi Montero Sport at least 4 times since January (it's August now) because the cap keeps coming off with the vibration of the motor.  The cap does not unscrew itself, rather the bolt-and-screw mechanism becomes loose and eventually the entire thing falls apart. Before you know it you will be driving without an oil cap.  I am so fortunate that the cap did not damage any of the belts since the cap could have easily become tangled with them and damaged the engine.  The bolt however does fall right into the oil intake but as of yet no noticeable engine problems have occurred (fingers crossed!)  To top it all off, your everyday auto parts store only carries this type of oil cap for this type of car.  I finally bought a different oil cap through Amazon that has a more secure attachment method than just a bolt and screw.  Please spare yourself the pain of having to buy this cap every couple of months.  It's cheap and falls apart easily!
B003SYWZTE|5|Perfect
B001QV9RLU|5|fit and went in easily / unit looks heavier duty then some other units / good price.
B00V30J86I|1|A bunch of junk.
B0049Z5BRE|5|this is the original part for 2010 chevrolet express 2500 4.3L. 4 doors
B00AECBNWS|5|Was not difficult to install in my 2012 Silverado 2500.  Rotates very easily and the clips that secure it to tailgate are nice.  Fit and finish of the product is good.  I bought the quick release connectors because I have a bed cover (Undercover Flex) but did not use them.  I had seen many reviews saying they were necessary with that type of bed covers (ones with rails).  I also ended up preferring the original releases to the lever you had to use on the quick release, I did not find them convenient but awkward as how close to bed they were.
B009Y33MH2|5|Its too big to fit my driver seat side and gets in the way. However, it fits the passenger seat. The only problem i have is that passengers wont be able to open the mirrors on the passenger side since the clips are not that far apart so they hold the mirror cover and mirror together.
B00I548U0K|5|Perfect fit on my 2012 Honda pilot. Easy to install .  Just make sure you don't over tighten the bolts on the bars.
B0009IQZPW|5|good quality
B00AOO67WM|1|BEWARE! I purchased the front and rear Torklift Tie Down sets for my 2015 Chevy Silverado 2500HD Double Cab Long Box.  I didn't attempt to install the rear set because I started with the front set and was shocked at the poor engineering and lack of any craftsmanship.  I have no idea how they cut the pieces or put holes in them?  It looked like a drunk with a plasma torch was behind schedule and had Lucile Ball help him out.  Several of the holes were too small or out of round and wouldn't even accept the bolt.  Even if the holes did line up, the parts wouldn't fit against the frame.  I ended staying in a hotel for two back to back trips and fabricated a complete set from scratch after returning home.  The guy at Torklift was very helpful in assisting with my return through Amazon.  I didn't get back from the two trips until after the return policy date closed.  The front set was ordered through Amazon from Camper RV Supply, who also was very good to work with on the return.<br />Unfortunately, I could not find an alternative product on the market and had to fabricate my own.  Hopefully, the folks at Torklift will sort it out.  Just be sure you have a back up plan if you do purchase a set.
B004M7TI6Y|5|Awesome
B00TFZYH5U|4|good quality, worked fine
B00RHF4ON0|5|I'm an ST owner and I love it. Good finish. Hope the pins hold up as long.
B0074EJ9B6|5|Excellent steering wheel cover, great service.
B008KSC976|5|Nice looking high quality!
B0068ETTW2|5|Very nicely made. I had been looking for something like this for a long time.
B000CN9KB0|1|They didn't even come close to fitting. I even verified the part number to make sure the wrong one wasn't sent
B000YAPL3C|4|came wrinkled.
B00J3X5MD0|1|3xl my butt that fit like that were larges sent back
B00GSAUHB8|5|&#34;Great shade and pretty cool technology!&#34;
B000IYQGJ2|5|Exactly as described fast shipping....
B00GLLW3AM|3|not nearly as bright as i thought it would be
B00V2VYN0E|4|Fast shipping, great quality, look good on the bike. Will be ordering another set for the rear.
B000CMHNOW|5|Worked Great
B002CCAEJ6|5|Great kit
B000W0KTMW|5|works well for me the key is not an issue like some people mentioned
B001NNBG10|1|Don't like the curved view.  Not worth the money.  Used it once and took it off.  I found it to be dangerous on the race track.
B004RFQIKA|5|I read a lot of reviews that talked about how these didn't catch very well on cement. Mine were perfect! Worked so much better than I could have imagined. It gave plenty of room to get under the mower and change the blades. I couldn't recommend these enough!
B00AWUIQV8|5|works great
B00QMV96VK|3|I own a 2004 Volvo XC90. I purchased the covers due to a rip in the driver's seat. The covers came nicely packaged. In appearance they were ok. Soft to the touch and met basic expectations. However; when trying to fit the driver's side cover, the headrest slit immediately ripped. The slit was not wide enough to accommodate the headrest. Once the cover was pulled completely over the seat, there was excess fabric at the seat base. Due to the fact that the set was reasonably priced, I did not feel the need to remove, re-pack, & return. After about 20-30 min of pulling & tucking, I was able to get a fit which satisfied me. I even added a little McGuire's restorer to the surface. This made the fabric appear to be a closer match to the black leather interior. For the price, this will do just fine.
B005H12QXG|5|They were perfect. Exactly what I wanted.
B000C580M8|5|On time, and exactly what I expected.
B00AV8R3RY|5|What I wanted to match the upper and lower grill of my new used 2007 Fahrenheit! It carries that styling into the car! Fast and well-packaged at a great price!
B0002NYDZ8|1|Originally bought this grease gun to use on my motorhome when the current grease gun used the last of it's grease.  Turned out this was a lot longer than first anticipated (well beyond the return period) but for whatever reason, a concern wasn't that the grease gun wouldn't work.<br /><br />Well, it didn't.  Loaded a new cartridge per instructions, which weren't so much confusing but seemed to use the near same term to describe several parts of the grease gun, not that there are a lot.  Never was able to prime it, never pumped any grease.  Fiddled with it for about an hour and then tossed it in the trash.  Maybe there's a trick to using it but I couldn't figure it out, or maybe I just received a defective unit.  Either way, it's now where it belongs and I won't be buying one from Amazon.
B00OQTGEK6|5|Good sale
B00SV54WXW|5|They fit well and really protect the carpet.
B004LX3AS6|4|Purchased this as a trickle charger for my motorcycle. Seems to work well and I like that it is a smart charger and turns on and off when appropriate.  I'm deducting 1 star for using a proprietary plug and charging $10 for an adapter that should be included.  The normal plug is industry standard and NOCO charges to make it work.
B000IYI4DI|5|Just what my niece needed!
B00BMX2ROG|5|This tail light is so awesome! The LED's are really bright and it looks great even when turned off, much better than the stock tail light. Not to mention super easy to install. No wire cutting or splicing necessary everything just plugs in and you're done. I think the hardest part was opening the box :)<br /><br />Note: There is a button on the bottom allowing for the sequential functions to be turned off and it must be done prior to installation. But let's face it why would you buy this kit and not use the sequential turn signals???
B00KG556O4|2|Not that great. one side works every now and than..
B00O2I5ILM|5|Perfect! Easy to install and now blind spots are a thing of the past.
B000MD4YKM|4|Works great!
B00DILUBL6|5|good price
B009XFDYNS|5|Works great so far.
B00CKGAGM4|5|Thank You
B009CZAU90|1|Advertised as factory match for evinrude  white. NOT EVEN CLOSE. factory color is off white or eggshell. this paint was bright white. waste of time and money.
B008BE02GO|5|could not see at night with old bulbs now I don't mind driving at night again.
B000QR6XJ4|4|fine
B00EDSTV00|4|This seat cover is very comfortable and looks great on my black leather seats.  I got it to give myself some space after sweaty workouts and it fits the bill perfectly.  I have the skinny part at the top tucked under my headrest and it stays firmly in place with no ties needed.
B000H6QWWC|5|So much better then just the pull tight straps
B004I0YB9E|5|Easy to install.  Looks perfect!
B00V97KY90|5|WENT IN WITHOUT A HITCH. WORK GREAT AND LOOK GREAT TOO. NICE PRICE
B000COUPJU|5|I already had high quality ignition wires, all I needed was the coil wire to go from a MSD 8207 Blaster SS Coil to a MSD 8563 Pro Billet Distributor. Did the job with plenty of length.
B000NU6RG8|5|works great,fast shipping
B00RW7XE8E|3|Easy to install but I would say they are average or slightly below average in quality.
B007IPSXFO|4|I am constantly losing stuff.  Most distressing of course is my phone, followed by my keys.  I received this product.  I put one of the receivers on my key ring.  I hot glued one to my phone.  Ironically, the day I received it I lost it.  All 5 receivers, and the transmitter, box and all.  I thought that was typical of my world.  I even briefly thought of the ironic scenario when I ordered it.  Laughably, it turned up under a couch in a friend's guest room, I am not quite sure how it got there.  I have  theory though.  I believe there is a bunch of gremlins(or demons) that hold a meeting every morning to brainstorm about ideas to drive Teresa crazy, discombobulated, and upset.  If there is something that shouldn't dropped, I'll drop it.  If there is something to trip over, I'll trip over it.  Heck, even if there isn't anything to trip over, I'll trip on my own feet.  This device should help with some of that.
B000CGAQ3S|1|The disc did not fit my 1974 Triumph Spitfire, only the pressure plate.  The mechanic had to order a separate disc to complete the job.
B004QQ8SEY|5|Works as expected.
B0097SVXVQ|5|Awesome. Why aren't there rear custom mats in this color though. Really holds the beach sand well.
B00I7HT6PI|5|Good item fast shipping
B00DLMN2P4|5|Great lights
B002NAMJHC|5|They were easy too install and adjust.  Just wish they were glass instead of plastic.
B000C6ZT44|1|The caliper was correct except for the brackets. The bracket was the wrong application for the 2005 Hyundai Santa Fe 3.5 ltr V6 MODEL. I ended up having to go on a 4 hour search for the brackets. Which caused me a huge inconvenience and unecessary stress.
B00TO7N0CK|5|Yes, well made
B008CLNYPC|5|great product
B0064VJBAO|4|VERY NICE
B00XZ9OZXG|1|Worked for a few days then stopped.  I've reset it twice now and seems to only hold for a few days.
B00PYQLJ9Q|5|Ordered it with a different font from the photo but it turned out GREAT!
B000SKV4U2|5|Only thing I put in my Mercedes SLK230.
B00V3JTZ1W|2|Had it programmed by the dealership, works well, but it fits just a little too snugly into the ignition and it very difficult to remove.  When the key is in the off position if I just loosely grab the key chain to pull it out (like I always do with the factory key) the key stays in the ignition and the emergency physical key pulls out of the back of the key fob.  If that isn't an issue for you then buy this and save yourself some money.  If your annoyed by stuff like this like I am then save yourself the hassle and just buy a better quality key.
B004I0W4LG|5|Perfect Fit on my 2000 XJ.
B001TWD5KU|5|Outstanding Purchase!
B00192KYE0|5|After years of hanging garbage bags from trees or propping them up against shade canopies I decided it was finally time to invest in tidying up my campsite. This particular item was fantastic.<br /><br />For our purposes it was the perfect size. It comfortably holds a 30 gallon trash bag. I purchased solid clips to hold the bag in place. We filled it up with a long weekends' worth of trash with room to spare. It can be staked down on both sides through attached loops. Kept it securely in place during a strong bout of wind and rain that passed through the area. Zips closed to help keep the rain (and any curious passing critters) out.<br /><br />Handles and compactibility make it nice and portable. At the end of the trip we took the trash bag out and the container itself was clean and dry (on the inside). I'm sure this could spring some holes over time if a raccoon, mouse, or other dedicated creature takes interest in what's inside of it, or there's broken glass, sharp metal, etc. That aside, I see this lasting a number of years and am very happy with the purchase for my campsite.
B009XZW0CY|5|cute
B00K24EA3M|5|Purchased this as a backup to keep on the RV, same as OEM
B002UCACJK|5|It fits exactly like the old one.
B00UIV1VV8|5|Good product good price good warranty
B004PLICEG|5|Excellent!
B00HLW18T2|3|Lights actually have an all metal housing!  And are very bright!  Tested them for operation, but haven't installed yet because one of the two came with the wrong size hardware to attach the mount to the light.  Not that big a deal, a $5 trip the the hardware store should have them all set.  Both lights have some light scratching on the lenses, and what looks like a glue mark right in the middle.  But for the price...  :/
B00QDCKXBU|5|Perfect product for all-American veterans like myself. When I roll up in my F150 with this on the front people know they're dealing with a real man.
B0026MCTL8|1|I purchased two of these and it came apart at every joint! I had to go buy a four pack of small hose clamps to get it to work.
B00062ZHTG|5|I needed a dual feed for my 4150 holley carb. This one worked perfectly. Chrome wasn't show quality but thats what I expected. Installed a Mr. Gasket fuel pressure gauge easily.<br /><br />If you don't have a outlet already to connect the fuel hose to this, Amazon will recommend the right size for you.
B000VB6QZQ|5|Good product, good price, Very FAST and REASONABLE SHIPPING.
B00B1SDFSO|5|I just finished putting these on my Jeep. I removed the 3 Torx bolts securing each &#34;jug&#34; onto the bumper, pulled out the &#34;jugs&#34; and then removed 2 of the &#34;nut clips&#34; from each. Since the new end caps mount with only 2 bolts rather than the &#34;jug's&#34; 3, I dug up a washer and a 10mm nut to fasten one of the &#34;jug&#34; bolts into the rearmost hole in the bumper on each side. With the 2 &#34;nut clips&#34; on each cap end, (over the rear cutout) press each into the bumper and reuse the remaining 4 &#34;jug&#34; bolts to fasten them into place.  Since the parts are from Mopar, they really do fit properly and look great.  Probably the easiest &#34;bolt on&#34; project I've ever done.
B004UR1B7K|5|Great product, sets up in under 10 minutes. Definitely firmed up the trailer.
B002OPKU9A|3|I love the look and it seems to be very well made.  I was disappointed with how loud these are and that there are no screws on the cone so that it can be take apart to add or repack the baffles so quiet them down.  If you want more rumble, get these.  If you prefer a quieter bike, try something else.
B00N18LXJ0|5|love this for night driving. No installation, just snap on.
B000E28C7M|5|Great product
B000KKPFFA|4|good stuff this.
B000CMIYE0|5|Very well built compared to other ones I've tried
B001GJ3FIS|5|Excellent value.  I've wasted money on more expensive nozzles.  This spray nozzle is a thing of beauty.
B007WICWLI|5|Good protection for my dash easily installed, keeps residue from building up on inside of windshield
B000B5S88K|5|Great product. Fit the motor homes spare tire perfectly!!
B00NNQMCC2|3|thought the adjustable size will fit my kinda big head but it did not :-(
B000K3IDS8|5|Perfect!
B00JS9K3ZG|5|I'm sure some toothless hillbilly will quote some nonsense scripture that they've never read to prove me wrong though.
B00VPOJC54|5|great
B00DP4ZHL0|5|I ADORE this magnet! It cracks people up, and expresses my sentiments exactly. yes, you DO need to put it on a metal surface, it is a MAGNET. I try to remember to remove it at the car wash, but when I forgot, it was still in place. It gets lots of positive comments from strangers in parking lots, and it mortifies my teenagers, so a win-win all around!
B00NXRX8RY|5|Best whippers I have ever used! My other car I had a set on them for 3 years and they still functioned as they did on day one. This is in the Arizona summer heat too
B005F2WHWW|5|It was perfect
B0012UK3M2|5|As advertised.
B005DJRDDU|3|It arrived earlier than advertised. I am somewhat skeptical of the design. It is a &#34;skin&#34; on the hood following the contour of the leading edge. I am hoping it &#34;deflects bugs.
B004YTP044|5|Excellent fit. Very durable. Worth the money.
B004OU620O|4|Looks Good
B001FH86YE|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B003IHKXKY|5|Works well.
B000CP8F5U|3|Are the legs included with hitch.
B00YC04DZW|3|Had an issue whenever I first received the wiring harness(the sent me the wrong one) I couldn't contact the seller at all. So I gave them a horrible review. Then one of the employees emailed me and we got everything figured out. I now have the correct harness and switch. i used it for my light bar on my jeep and it was a simple design and worked just fine.
B00JRE38EA|5|These work great in clearance lights. If they don't light up when installed, simply reverse them to get the correct polarity.
B00CFBV8FI|5|Received quickly and now my van is like new again. My husband  was able to install so saved a lot of money rather than going into shop for repairs.
B00252BWOY|5|great door handle. replaced my original handle in my 1997 Jeep Wrangler TJ half doors. Look and function perfectly.
B00AWBNQ0I|5|Perfect fit and received in a timely fashion
B0002KKHSS|2|I read many reviews and I thought I was getting something really great when I ordered the 32 ounce spray bottle and a gallon jug of the this cleaner. I was delighted to received it before I went on vacation so I could take it with to clean the mess the bugs made on our travel trailer vinyl  awning. I very sorry to say this product did not clean the mess the bugs made on the awning. Hopefully I will find something that this product will clean.
B00JIGZXMC|5|My third brake light has a partially melted red outer lens.  With these leds it makes no difference since they give off a bright red light, before gaps of white would shine tru the cracked lens.  At night all you see is a bright red shine from them when you hit the brakes, perfect.  Also the third brake light comes on instantly on tapping the brake pedal. Very happy with these leds so far.  Time will tell if they hold up but for now it is instant gratification.
B001O13BLO|5|Installed easily onto my wife's 2006 TC and works great (going on several months now)
B00AUKCOJA|1|Not a shown
B002SAUY74|5|They fit and I've not noticed any issues. I particularly liked knowing that these are the same weight as the original lugnuts.
B0002KKTTU|5|good price
B00A9MKEOG|5|Very 9.  SUPER EASY  INST..
B000COATYG|1|Read the add closely before ordering..
B00AQOSAV6|5|This is the best quality differential cover I have ever purchased. Looks absolutely awesome on my SRT8 Jeep.
B00MOUBQ70|5|great
B001TJ3HUG|5|As good as leatherique which a a huge complement for something that costs 3 times as much or more.
B000KKB9AU|5|I have a triple tandem trailer and felt that having two spare tires was the only way to go, and glad I did 3 month after buying this mount and adding the extra spare to it I ran over one of my lawn timbers on the edge of the driveway, crushing it and exposing the rebar stake that was holding it in place. Puncturing one of the tires side wall and mousing another on its side wall (ouch), but the day was not lost! Backed up to the garage and replaced the tires with the spares and using the moused one as the spare and headed to the bay.  When mounting this I did replace the nuts and bolts that came with it because they were not Galvanized.  I just added SS bolts with SS nylon locking nuts.<br /><br />v/r<br />Rocky
B00VNX0A7G|5|Perfect fit. 10 minutes to replace.
B00RJNE7UA|5|Fits great and on time.
B000HTQK9Y|5|Looks fantastic. Fit is correct, although not slotted in back for the  3 bolts that are inside where the gas cap is. The mounting screws are slightly shorter than the o.e.screws, which makes it a tighter space to work in. All in all an excellent option!
B000182F1I|5|Great Gift for Christmas!
B00IER05ZG|5|Easily installed into my '12 Dodge Challenger, and it looks awesome at night! Now if I could only change the dome lights too!
B004BGN0L0|5|We are in drought times here in Cali and using this has saved my car from public humiliation. It's faster than using water and for a lazy person like me, that means a lot. I've got a little bit more than half the bottle left and I've used this about 3 times so far.
B00NZ8OB4K|5|good quality. Great price. Fantastic seller.
B009S2ZQNM|5|Door handle broke, replaced it with this. Much better than the plastic one. Replacing the passenger side with the same one.
B000WPAO90|5|I love James gaskets
B005797JDA|5|Work perfect
B000WNPUUK|5|it is great ....
B000CCM3J2|3|It is not like super glue at all
B00KQ1ALKC|3|Really didn't see much of a difference in truck performance or gas mileage.
B0024NSJWW|4|The small bolt clips were put on backwards. But other than that excellent piece.
B00757E7LE|1|horrible reception
B00KGNW2NE|1|It said it would fit my 05 BMW X3 but did not on the rear of the vehicle
B00LG07MZE|5|vIt is very convenient
B00FKHKQ0W|5|GREAT
B00TO0I3B0|5|Nice Item and Service
B0059929HO|5|Recommended to every 5th wheeler
B003NR6WAY|3|Very difficult to put on. It is not one piece but many smaller pieces put together. It took a lot longer to put on than it should have.
B0071HE2DG|5|Great little unit lets you talk to 3 other riders. Installed in a open faced 3/4 helmet, has no wind noise.<br />Have 2 others installed in full coverage helmets.
B008KWP84I|5|K&N makes good stuff.  This filter is for my 2014 R1200 GSW.  Fit was right and the attached 17mm &#34;nut&#34; makes for easy installation.
B00R6RQ9B4|1|It was the wrong glass.
B00O8RWF86|5|Worked perfect to align the chain on my Yamaha FZ6
B00JDPR2LI|5|Excellent product
B001KOMQYI|5|Why would you think it's for a scooter, cmon man. The scooter pics are to show you what it looks like on YOUR ruckus. Thanks for the warning but I didn't think I could get a ruckus for less than $300!
B0068FYFJI|5|The Baja kit has everything I needed to get the bike road ready. The fender piece is a universal fit so it won't fit like the factory part but I had no problems getting it installed.
B00AQI8SH8|5|Excellent exact fit my car
B00KPYPSVW|2|My factory clutch doesn't fit the single mass flywheel
B00DSSNPSU|5|Perfect on my 2015 crv, it arrive earlier before the estimated delivery.
B005NLQAHS|5|Does exactly what is advertised. Connects fine to android tablet
B000C7XVVQ|5|Removed old switch and installed this one in about 15 minutes.
B00KLZ65GM|4|Great for keeping the red clay off my face and out of my mouth.
B00CMVB5R2|3|First Chevy switches suck!  Dealer wanted way more to replace an even offered to split the difference since they have had trouble with them, purchased these for FAR below what they wanted. Works perfectly they do not light up an I can't recall if the factory ones did or not. Don't care as long as they work and they do.<br />***UPDATE***<br />Replaced the rear door switches and after less than 2 yrs they no longer work.<br />Changed rating to 3 stars..
B008427D88|5|Work perfectly
B00NB3UUDK|5|I finally found a gas cap that works on the new EPA gas containers, such as those sold at Home Depot.  Not cheap, but worth every penny.  I transport 5 gallon gas containers full of gas for my boat, and I no longer have to worry about gas spills in my car.  I don't understand why they don't sell these at HD.
B00PC0G07A|5|looks and feels amazing just had to youtube a video on how to do it.<br />i recommend you do not skip one line but go threw all of them
B00342574K|5|GREAT ITEM I BOUGHT WITHOUT USIG THE STORE CARD
B0002MG5M8|5|Exactly what we needed and in perfect shape.
B002FYFD74|3|This stuff takes multiple applications as it isn't very &#34;sticky&#34; and runs off if you spray it on a vertical surface. Get the foaming kind instead
B00GQ0A1NY|5|Holding up pretty good so far after putting 48 solid hours on them so far
B00GWESZDC|5|Fits just like original. Easy to install.  Color matched perfect. I would recommend this brand to anyone.  Shipping was. Fast had the product in just a few days.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Crazy bright. Awesome for fog lights or off-roading.

B00M7GW5XA|5|They work great
B00FMIZ9AQ|5|Great Price, Perfect Fit, Fast Delivery. The step bars were at my house in two days. The bars were wrapped and secured in a good box. The bars fit our 2015 Chevy 1500 perfectly. After about an hour under the truck the bars were installed. All for about $150 less then what our local truck shops wanted. Win-win-win.
B000C5YEW8|1|I bought the same brand new (not rebuilt) compressor (not from Amazon), and after having it installed in my Taurus it started leaking the green fluorescent oil as soon as I drove my car away from the garage that did the install. I will never, ever buy their junk s__t again. I will probably have to replace it and when I do, it will be a Motorcraft compressor from Amazon and the work will be done at a better garage!
B00F4O3M6Q|5|This is the 3rd one of these I have purchased.<br />Its much nicer than many taillights costing twice this.<br />Excellent fit and finish, quality of materials (heavy)  is very good and only a few dollars more than the cheap crapola stamped aluminum ones for $39.99 all over the Internet.<br />Hint:<br />(1) No-one mentions this, and its not apparent from the pics, but it *DOES* have the white lens insert under bottom of red lens, and a slot to shine white light onto your license plate. This is to keep from having cops use this as a reason to pull you over. Meets state requirements.<br />(2) Instead of using the bolts that come with it, I use rivets to attach to fender.<br />The end of the bolts will not protrude under fender then, and will not scar your tire when and if you bottom the fender out.<br />To get to the farthest rear bolt, (under the housing) need to remove housing from bracket. (Its simple, 2 screws and then just screw back onto housing bracket. Then just line up the license plate bracket first to install, then taillight will automatically line up straight when you put it back on.<br />(3) Go to Home Depot, Radio Shack or where-ever , get a rubber boot/dust cover and some heat shrink tube to cover the wires in the back of the light, use your lighter or torch etc to shrink it down. Looks better, and keeps water out of the taillight housing.<br />(4) Also, I replace the bulb with an LED, makes this bright/lite. Custom Dynamics makes a nice one that fits in the housing lens and plugs right into the base.<br />(5) Use Loctite Blue on all the screws.<br /><br />If you do the install using these tips, its bulletproof, wont go anywhere and you wont have any issues with vibration knocking out your light bulb, moisture or dirt getting into lens , lens falling off etc. Nothing to do with the quality of the taillight, (which is good) only that this light tends to be installed on rigid framed bikes, choppers etc, and they can really take a beating if you cover all your bases.your bases.
B0016KFXSC|1|I needed a lock for a trip.  picked this unit up locally fo 21 bucks.<br />loaded up for a early am departure.<br /><br />This thing will not lock.<br /><br />21 and change wasted<br /><br />I always thought Reese manufactured quality parts, this one did not work for me.  Trash can time I think.
B00GJLLM5G|5|Good Quality bright lights. A little expensive but overall good product.
B00495UQT2|4|it serve the purpose, not 100% correct
B00TDM65PU|3|It was ok to many holes in it for water to get in to let it rust out.
B00BCRM9YA|5|It was awesome fit
B00KUYEPPM|5|just what i needed
B004I6AN86|5|Excellent!
B00BTLEJXI|5|Was more than expected.  The car looks really good now.  They fitted perfectly.
B004W5TJMO|5|They fit perfect and were a snap to replace. Under 10 minutes for both and look great. Would have done this sooner if I'd known how inexpensive and easy it was going to be.
B00FJ5LBOA|5|Assume for camping
B0072UPAQK|5|easy to install and very strong
B00V5F4VDG|5|Good quality, and well packaged.
B00AXA98XC|5|Was just as advertised, good quality.
B00K72C1T4|1|The Extreme Max 1229.4000 Battery Buddy is the third trickle charger brand I have used and it failed in the shortest time of the three (5 months). The other brands I tried are the  Black & Decker BM3B (failed after 15 months) and the Battery Tender 021-0123 (lasted 4 years). I have just repurchased another Battery Tender 021-0123 and would recommend if you are shopping for a maintenance charger to go ahead and pay the small extra and do the same. Operationally, they all worked similarly but if you experience the same length of service times that I did, you'll come out ahead by buying the &#34;junior&#34;.
B000C57W5O|5|Used this for my 2000 Chrysler 300M.<br /><br />Solid product at a great price.
B00029XGQ4|3|The product guide makes some pretty bold claims like, made from the finest materials. I beg to differ. The unit I received had the red plastic part separated from the rest of the horn unit. It was just hot glued to the black piece and fell off. The metal accents look very cheap as well.<br /><br />The horn works fine, but it feels and looks very cheap
B001CQWM8E|3|Wouldn't recommend for those with a roof on your SxS. The bracket is just too wide.
B004JB58LW|5|Got everything very quickly, all parts seem of high quality and fit perfectly.
B00OM7WQQI|5|My boyrfiend loved it!!
B00SAFW5QE|5|its beautiful n complete de personalized look i wanted to give my car ....thanku
B0055F50UU|4|Provides good flexibility for those problem loads

B001Y93LMA|5|Excellent!
B007GR66HQ|5|Fits well, really like the flip-up visor. Well worth the price.
B00HYIJW0U|4|A drop-in replacement for most &#34;Camco&#34;-style RV shower faucets.  This one replaces the two knobs with a single handle.  The instructions are straight-forward.  Don't freak out if you see water dripping from under the offset adapter (the black attachment seen on top of the faucet).  It appears to be a relief valve that lets water drain from your shower hose.
B008UR7J6I|1|Never worked for me. It turns on but doesn't do anything. Instructions were a joke. Threw it out the next day. This company is a joke.
B00HVIGLBG|5|Works perfect!
B0069WZ0A8|2|High quality product with excellent fit and finish.
B00E6AD7V4|4|Super cute!
B00EECLMWK|5|went in well, just as bright as the factory and look nearly identical . Would not hesitate to buy them again. As long as your know what you are doing when you put them in you will be fine!
B0045LOBLY|4|Works well,  my bumper is powder coated so I ended up soldering a wire to one of the prongs to get a better grounding point.  The light works great.
B00L8WP4IW|5|Bought these to use in my n54 and they worked out great. Seller was great also. Forgot to send 1 of the plugs and when contacted they immediately sent out another one.
B00SLKQVI6|5|Great product, great price, fast shipping!
B0082YY08E|5|easy to put in
B005JPJMI2|5|GREAT PRODUCT VERY EASY TO USE BRILLIANT SHINE!
B00PVQRUN8|1|Too small of compartments, it doesn't stay open, so you struggle getting your bags inside. Not!!
B0068ESPKE|1|Shipped kit did not include the correct parts
B00GOW6V5Q|5|This product was exactly as it was described in the ad and it fit perfectly over twin 30lb. propane tanks on our camper. Would order again from this supplier.
B0016ZM61O|5|Great quality wipes the rain away so smoothly leaving it nice and clear.  Will order again
B00UZ9H96E|5|Good very Good!
B000FW2MC2|5|I like this very much - because it does the job!
B000C3XD90|5|Works and fits exactly as said for a 08 Civic Sedan. Replace it with every oil change.
B0009IBJE4|5|This works great, far better and lighter than my old charger.  You will be amazed at how light this charger is. It was easy to use, large display and being able to read battery capacity was a nice feature.  Charges batteries well and used about 5 times so far without any problems
B000C2YCJG|5|Durable and works just perfect
B003LS15XY|5|A perfect fit for my Elantra 2012 1.6l Gamma Engine. Just installed it and hoping it will help my engine run smoother. SOLI DEO GLORIA (Glory to God Alone)
B002P8WU9Y|1|Not good at all
B004HFDGN2|5|Outstanding! Absolutely wonderful and very professional looking. Proud to display it on my vehicle.<br /><br />USAF Veteran.....
B00F66VK48|3|The part fit OK had a small crack in lense.
B002SAUY74|5|It's a Toyota part,  should be quality with a service life.
B00UN46Z4S|5|Excellent fit and a heavy duty floor mat.
B007VRCMM4|5|A#1 Quality
B00E5OUOCQ|2|This doesn't work very well.  I have a Hyundai Sonata - you would imagine a jumbo would fit.  It seems a bit undersized.  It does not stay in place well.  The idea is that you fold down your sun visors and that is what holds it.  It kind of works but I've seen better systems than this.  Not really that impressed.  Wish I had tried something else.
B00QOJW62Q|5|High quality and function very well.
B006G2MJZU|5|worked fine
B0032H6WNW|4|This it a good product the material is great and the straps work great as well. The plastic clips are the only downfall with it the keep coming undone had to zip tie them on. But a great product for the money overall.
B00IOBT0AS|2|I agree completely with another reviewer. This should be called Dash Not Glass. It leaves streaks on glass. I use the old standby Windex for my windows.
B001KXN3YQ|2|didnt work for rear main seal slow leak 2002 highlander
B00N2F1PHW|5|Excellent
B0013REXO8|5|These are awesome. They are worth the money you spend. Made a great edition to my jeep.
B00A8MZ7IA|5|Another high quality item from Chemical Guys. Love them. Hold up well through use and washes. Use their microfiber wash to keep them clean and they'll work like new every time.
B0101A0C38|1|Lame as can be. Is this guy 4 real? Get a life trump. And learn some hair styles.
B002ZBPXGS|3|Works fine
B011AHHZ7C|5|Exactly as described. Arrived on time. Thanks.
B00G6UHFB0|5|Great product and price
B0012TWRBS|5|Works on my VStrom
B001GJ3FIS|4|Have not used it yet but it appears to be as shown,
B007TWOKEO|5|Great price and quick shipping
B009YH70CQ|5|Thank you for a very good product
B000CFAVA2|5|Theses were better than expected.  Look great on our truck and keeps water deflected from the top of the window.
B00CQ40KVM|2|For the price not bad. Too small for the Chevy Equinox even though it said it would fit. Will have to purchase the mats directly through Chevrolet
B005D4IJZQ|4|These were as advertised but a bit pricey for what you get.
B000BGHXFS|5|Exact match for the one I lost on my 2009 Jayco 26BH.
B005H7OCKA|4|A bit pricey for what it is and tedious to change -  3 small bolts inside the housing with torx heads.  But it does the job.  I had to replace this part due to a self inflicted wound: I trusted Wix to provide a filter that &#34;fit&#34;.  the Wix filter doesn't have the four prongs inside the filter element to engage the interlock on this return tube (it has four prongs but they are not in the right location - thanks again Wix).  Not realizing this, I tried to persuade the filter and cap onto the housing and the check valve in the return tube broke off.  I think it broke mostly due to heat and age but could have done without the hassle.<br /><br />1. Only buy Motorcraft filters<br />2. Have a torx bit, magnet on a stick, long needle nose pliers, and patience when changing this part
B0051D3MP6|3|I purchased  the Black & Decker BM3B to replace a failed Battery Tender 021-0123 (it served me for 4 years). I was initially impressed by it's solid construction and cheaper price. It failed after 13 months. I then tried the Extreme Max 1229.4000 Battery Buddy. It is constructed much like the Battery Tender junior and, like the B&D, sells at a price less than the &#34;Junior&#34;. It just failed and I have only had it for 5 months. Operationally speaking - when they all worked, they appeared to work equally well.  The obvious solution is to pay the small difference in price and go with the unit that lasts 4 to 8 times longer. For me that is the Battery Tender 021-0123. I just bought another and am recommending that you buy it also over the other 2 brands.
B0064M8YLK|5|GREAT SKID PLATE! Best option out there, even better than noisy aluminum plates. Took some big hits. Weighs less and looks better than metal ones, and make ZERO noise. Do yourself a favor and leave out the rear bracket when you install this thing. Not only is it a pain to fit with the cheap bit of bent metal as a &#34;bracket&#34;, but it serves no real purpose. The bolt holes are more than enough, and saves you a few more ounces on the install.
B00KSDKWZ2|5|Great cover,
B00HW58R92|4|Came in on time and matched the description perfectly. If, like me you have moved your stereo to and from cars 4 times now, it is absolutely a great tool to prevent damage to your dash and to the harness that holds your radio. The non marking plastic (?) ply-bars also work well for removing door panel pieces, and even for emblems on the outside of your car without scratching the paint.
B000NVW1LM|5|It did resolve a huge leak in my Acura RL. Amazing stuff
B00SGSMV6Y|5|Love this pack
B00067BW6S|5|Great Product, Nice and Bright.
B0010GK3SM|5|100% satified.
B00NEL6HT0|5|This K&N filter, like all the others they offer, is fantastic. Not only does it filter better than any paper filter, but at about twice the cost of a paper filter, it's permanent . . . forever. Buy their cleaning kit and you'll never have another dirt-choked air filter again. Buy their combustion air filters, too.
B00K0VMXDQ|3|I'm assuming the product works as advertised but when I opened the instructions the print was so small that I had to use a magnifying glass to read them.  There are no online instructions on their webpage to print and I'm still waiting to hear back from the company via email about larger instructions (3 days) and I doubt I will hear back.<br />I would NOT have purchased this product had I known the instructions were so poor and customer service also poor.  If I ever have to use the device in an emergeny I should not have to use a magnifying glass to read the print!
B00BDUY2XC|3|Most pieces we needed were okay. The rest was really worn.  A little pricy
B002PQSFVS|5|Worked very well bolted right up with no problems
B001R1Q62W|4|Nice looking lamps. I haven't figured out how to adjust them yet, the aim is low. If anyone knows how, please leave your advice.
B008JORKP2|5|This may be a the little bit smaller side...but we love it!  We have a family of 5 and it was plenty big for us to sit around the campfire.  It gives off a nice flame and we actually roasted hot dogs and s'mores with it. It will warm you up on a cool evening as well. The pit itself is nice looking too. Very pleased with it (and plus...you don't smell like a campfire).
B004J9HEWK|2|not as tough as i expected
B000E243CA|5|does a good job
B00E9IS3P8|5|Grill fit perfact and looks great ..shipping was fast
B000NK9CKG|5|Amazing purchase experience from Amazon.com. The product meets the expectations
B00J54DA3Q|5|perfect color match, great online instructions, quick delivery.........
B000C9JXZ2|1|This got one star because I couldnt give it 0 stars. This part is FALSELY advertised it is not a genuine GM sensor at all. A few days after I ordered this &#34;genuine GM&#34; part I finally got a shipping notice that my part was shipping out from China. I immediately tried to cancel the order, but I couldnt because it had &#34;already shipped&#34; so I had to wait two weeks for it to arrive so I can ship it back and try to have my money returned. After the two week wait, it finally arrived and just as expected, it is definately not a genuine part it is a cheap knock off that may or may not even work. I will not be trying it I'll just consider this a $25.00 loss. Who knows though maybe my money i'll get my money back when my return finally makes it back to China.
B0031HL8SC|3|These are very well made, what they lack is a decent attachment mechanism to the brake lines that run in parallel to the factory brake lines. The brake lines on my truck have a nice built in plastic fastener that spaces the rubber hoses apart. These come with zip\cable ties. Very disappointed and ended up returning them and cannot comment on the performance since they were never installed.
B005JZQU2S|5|Absolutely love it!! No issues & good quality.
B000NQ4O26|5|Installed on a 2010 Teryx in under an hour and worked great. I had the brackets mounted so the seat would face to the rear. The seat was very sturdy and very well made. If you don't need to use it I recommend taking it out as it rattles a little when no one is sitting on it. Oh and to take it on and off takes less than 30 seconds.
B0082NET5E|5|As promised
B00L2UFJFS|3|It had some plastic tip where it attaches to machine so it is hard to hook up and becomes loose= great price compared to artic cat
B00NBOSI0G|2|Frame is put together well, but that is where the quality ended.  The engine is terrible.  The packaging of the oil container left oil leaking everywhere after shipping, and once you put oil into the engine and get it running, it has issues staying running for long enough to break it in.  Once you do get to that point, check for oil leaks as soon as you attempt to ride it.  The one I got leaked oil terribly bad, started smoking from hot oil slinging from tire onto exhaust, and left oil on our driveway.  I didn't have it for a couple hours and I'm sending it back for another product.  Sad because this has such good promise for convenience.
B0037LKX3I|4|Used for towing my Smart Car behind my campervan.  They worked well mostly.  However one side did slide down a few times when it was rainy.  It never slid all the way off, thank goodness.  I think it was from not wiping off the magnetic strip before applying the light to the car.  Other times it would turn slightly.  In both instances the light still worked.  I think the key before application is to make sure to wipe off the lights before applying to the tow vehicle.  Other than that for the money I am very pleased with the lights.  Also, I shou,d note that the is only a small area of steel on the Smart Car to attach the lights, so perhaps that was the problem?
B000C3HBX4|1|Finally went out to install kit this weekend.  But the plug-in for the passenger side blinker did not work.  And now find out that they will not replace because of refund policy sucks.  This is the last item I will ever purchase thru Amazon.
B001LHVOVK|5|Works perfect for finding troubsome engine light problems...recommend!
B00BAZCK6G|5|I have them now in my Wife's 2015 Buick Regal T-Type.....turned her driving lights into FOG lights and they give off loads of light so still could be driving lights just yellow..
B004GCCDO4|5|Fit perfectly. I believe this says it won't fit an 02 f150, but it's exactly what came off of it.
B0084L0YR6|5|Exactly what I needed! Works great
B0001MQ7DG|1|The product did not work. I had to return it.
B000BOC2E2|5|Good product.
B009NK6FAW|5|Nice license plate.  Looked perfect on my vapor silver mustang.  No issues thus far!
B002TPDSEO|5|Bilstein for when nothing but the best will do the job.
B00IO98UTC|5|Great brakes and rotors . They make sure they fit your car before sending !
B00JA1VEAK|5|simple - just be carfull and do one side at a time - trunk is like a guillotine!
B00TO63EPO|5|This does a good job
B007TY1RU2|3|Fit my Mazda B series truck. Better then the cast iron one I purchased last year that broke the first time when used.
B0101M9X0O|1|It's a bumper sticker.  What more to be said.
B009ZSKNEG|5|Extends a Gen-Turi above a large motorhomes roof so there is not downdraft.
B00809YANG|5|Great price and it fit perfectly where the old air filter was installed. This is a very easy item to replace, and it has improved the air quality in my wife's Honda Fit.
B000K7HA56|5|Worthy upgrade, quality seat, delivered lightning fast
B010TZ90N8|5|I like it so far.
B00MH4663C|5|This is terrific--purchased for a finicky starting boat--got it--used it--started right up!<br />Peace of mind when you are all alone or have a less than reliable vehicle.<br />Plus it charges many other items--I have not tried that yet.<br />But--highly recommend the 600 compared to the 400AMP.
B011P4DQBY|5|best spray wax i have ever used
B007G5KI7C|1|Looks great and feels solid, this switch is rendered useless by a very loud / audible 'click'. The click is so defined that I thought it was a latching button. I was going to use this switch as a mute button for a recording studio but the signal interrupt makes a loud pop on the audio.
B00ISFDHZO|1|Need too return armrest it's not what I need
B00H7RYTBU|5|great fit
B002OUDU74|2|Had it in our fifth wheel camper.  It sometimes kept great time and sometimes had a mind of its own.
B005G9CN3C|3|There were no instructions at all...
B003LZ6BZY|5|Great antenna and really long reception.
B000WJ7D22|5|Great product
B00JKSY8HY|5|Fits my 2014 civic si coupe perfect! Looks great!
B000T8GJTY|5|very nice
B00K2MYQ7E|5|Nice clock
B008G1XEIK|5|These fit my 2005 Ford Explorer great..
B0023VBHA6|5|very satisfied.  It looks like it came from the factory.  Shipping was fast and the price was reasonable and it was easy to install.
B000IYN65E|4|great quality
B000BLJM9S|1|Never got it to work right.  Better pressure from a garden hose with hand squeeze nozzle.  Needed this to clean out dirty corners in the second story roofing.  Not powerful enough.  Would welcome suggestions.
B00GOXMTBK|4|I haven't used it or actually put it on but it fits my 2014 Kia soul +. It is in my case 1&#34; smaller than the rims I have. But remember it's only meant for the day to get you to the tire shop.
B006CRT72W|5|As advertised
B001C3MFFC|5|Great product for the price. Fit good and look great.
B00JOC17FC|4|Product as pictured, quality is pretty good. Plastic for the tube is nice and sturdy. This was just a tiny bit thicker than my old tube which caused it to stick. Sanded it down and now it works great.
B00HFWYZO8|4|Havent used them yet but came quickly and seems to be a nice heavy weight product, The winter will tell the story.
B00A8MZ7IA|5|ok
B004KDEWTS|5|Good tools!
B0001EXVFG|5|Worked great.  Quality was A+
B00H90NJ4S|5|Work well
B007XE8C74|4|Only had it for a couple of months and used it for my old 2004 X3... works fine.
B001CF1A6U|3|Shank was too large for my ATV mount. Maybe I measured wrong but it's kind of big. Good quality though. Nice powder coating
B00KZ0VEGE|5|works great
B00W2P9BQA|4|Very nice boot fits to size as.well
B000CF6S2C|4|Does the job. Strong durable plastic. Rear windows hard to close due plastic not clearing rails.
B000JFES40|5|Received quickly. Wired up and it works
B00F7GXNX8|5|yeah.
B00FEZEVQK|5|BRIGHT!
B00BMGU35I|5|good quality.
B00KHAM8TE|4|I love the item but I have had it less than a year and it is already starting to peal around the edge but it is very beautiful and bold colors.
B000NVW1LM|5|I was skeptical but after seeing Scotty Kilmer say it was good i decided to give it a try. My 1968 chevy truck has been leaking oil and leaving puddles everywhere so I had to watch where I parked. After using this stuff it has actually stopped leaking and I cant even find a drop under it when I park now! I also used it in a floor jack that was almost 30 years old. I was going to throw it away but now it works fine. I will be ordering more of this.
B0068O1MNG|5|Noticeable increase in performance after replacing dirty / clogged filter.
B000WK4ESW|5|Perfect for my bike helmet.
B0012Q4H96|5|Almost all 6 came with perfect gap. Fit perfect in my 2005 Tacoma prerunner, v6. Will buy again.
B00K59PV8C|5|good
B00Q4KTJS4|1|Doesn't fit at all.  Don't waste your time.  Was to big for my trunk deck.  Would have to cut off the ends to make it work and the color match isn't all that great either.  After receiving it I'm assuming the other reviews are not actual customers
B0055DNYF0|1|Item turned out to be different from the description!!
B007VRAFEG|5|works great
B008KQLDFC|5|These are very nice, I expected some little gentle handles... but nope, these are very nice, heavy and manly. Even my wife said, wow, those are awesome.... they look fantastic on the bike.nice grip too.
B00DLMMZ3Y|4|Set was nicely boxed ....plug and play connections...droped in to 2014 gmc Silverado. .. wors great
B000FPYHOU|1|Save your money. Impossible to navigate set-up. Bought two, both duds.
B0036E9VB6|3|Not bad, works, puts air into my tires just fine. Didn't blow any fuses on my RS 4. Wires & hoses were long enough to fill any of the tires.<br /><br />However, the way it actually attaches to the tire nozzle is inconvenient. It's not as simple as one would expect -- instead of being able to press the compressor's hose connector against the tire nozzle connector, like most air pumps, this one requires one to screw the connector on. Not ideal, but I'm sure I wouldn't care much in an emergency.
B001FCB4JS|5|Works great and great Value. Shipped quickly and was more than enough to do the Job I had.
B00KTJ9I46|5|Perfect replacement & easy to program.  Instructions included with purchase.  Easy to follow.
B000GOHV02|5|Perfect... Replace, works perfect
B00FRHODI6|5|Best wiper blades I've ever owned
B006DY682G|1|Terrible. These glasses are not Nannini. Nannini brand cost the same but delivers two in the same case. Also the quality is terrible. I spray just a little perfume in my hair and some drops landed in my glasses and they got ruined.<br />Now I have to buy a real Nannini somewhere else.
B00026Z3DQ|1|Very poor weld quality.  I could actually see air holes and bubbles in one of them  The packaging was also very poor.  I did not expect the fit and finish on these to blow me away at this price point, but I certainly did not expect it to look as bad as it did.  I sent them back almost instantly.
